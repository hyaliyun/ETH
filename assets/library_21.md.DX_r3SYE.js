In 1845 the genus Dierama was established by Karl Koch (1809-1879) based on this specimen. Before that the plant had been placed in various genera including Ixia, Sparaxis and Watsonia. The species name has been misapplied to D. inyangense, D. densiflorum and to D. plowesii. 'Dierama' is Greek for 'funnel' and describes the flower's shape, while 'pendulum' is the Latin word for hanging suspended. The plant is some 2 metres tall with extremely slender and wiry stems, dividing into hair-like branches, gracefully curving under the weight of the flowers, and readily nodding in the lightest of breezes. As do all in the genus, it has a large flattened corm covered in layers of tunics made up of dry fibres. A new corm is formed every growing season, the old defunct corms remaining intact for many years, stacked one above the other. It grows in dense and fairly extensive tufts from Knysna to the Amatolas in the Eastern Cape and, when not in flower, the tall, slender, rigid leaves resemble those of a coarse sedge. The flower colour ranges from pink to pure white, while the tough, rounded capsule contains numerous angular brown seeds.Cape Flowers by a Lady The (Southern) Sotho people of the Kingdom of Lesotho use a decoction of the corm of Dierama pendulum as an enema with strongly purgative properties.\\"Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa\\" 2nd edition,Watt J.M.& Breyer-Brandwijk M.G. pub.E.&S.Livingstone; Ltd. 1962 p.504 (under synonym D. pendula Bak.)

Biography Glasse was the son of Dr. Samuel Glasse, rector of St. Mary's in Hanwell, London and grew up in the rectory. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, receiving degrees in 1779 and in 1782, succeeding his father as rector of St Mary's, Hanwell in 1785, having ‚Äúdistinguished himself very early in life by his uncommon proficiency in Hebrew literature.\\" Glasse served as the domestic chaplain to Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Cambridge, the seventh son of George III. Involved in Poor Law reform, he was described as a man ‚Äúwhose learning, abilities, and good principles, have already entitled him to the thanks of his country, and will secure his fame with posterity.‚Äù He acquired recognition as a classical scholar with his translation of William Mason's Caractacus, and John Milton's Samson Agonistes into ancient Greek. In a different vein he published a novel entitled The Affecting History of Louisa: The Wandering Maniac, or, Lady of the Hay-Stack; so called, from having taken up her residence under that shelter, in the village of Bourton, near Bristol, in a state of melancholy derangement; and supposed to be a natural daughter of Francis I, emperor of Germany, a real tale of woe. Partly translated from an anonymous French work, L'inconnue, histoire v√©ritable it was an attempt to prove that a mysterious refugee at Bristol was identical with F√©lix-Julienne de Schonau, otherwise Freulen, who claimed to be the natural daughter of the emperor Francis I. The work was popular enough to go into three editions.Alsager Vian, ‚ÄòGlasse, George Henry (1761‚Äì1809)‚Äô, rev. Mari G. Ellis, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He also frequently contributed to The Gentleman's Magazine, which in 1805 published an amusing Latin translation by him of a popular comic song, Unfortunate Miss Bailey, composed to be sung by Thomas Moore at a fashionable masquerade.Given by Lady Louisa Manners: The Gentleman's Magazine\\", Vol.75, part 2:August 1805, p.750 A version of this work found posthumously among the papers of James Joyce was briefly ascribed to him as an original composition.Fargnoli, A. Nicholas and Gillespie, Michael Patrick, A Critical Companion to James Joyce (2006), p.230 Glasse built himself a new home called The Hermitage in 1809 on Church Road in Hanwell, London. It survives still, and is executed in the rustic style of cottage orn√© and has a grade II English Heritage listing. It is described by Nikolaus Pevsner's Buildings of England as \\"a peach of an early C19th Gothic thatched cottage with two pointed windows, a quatrefoil, and an ogee arched door, all on a minute scale. Inside, an octagonal hall and reception room\\". The style is influenced by the Brighton Pavilion, where Glasse had permission to use the royal pew of the chapel. Glasse built The Hermitage on borrowed funds. As he had extensive correspondence with Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, Glasse most likely planned for the cottage to be acquired by a member of the royal family or the literati of the time, many of whom spent time in the nearby mansions of Chiswick, Richmond and Twickenham. When this enterprise failed to materialise Glasse faced financial ruin and, as described by Hester Thrale in her memoirs, went to the City to obtain one last loan to cover his debts. On stopping for sustenance at the Bull and Mouth Inn in St Martin's Le Grand, he realised that he had left the entire sum in the hackney cab that had brought him there, and hanged himself at the Inn on 30 October 1809, predeceasing his father by 3 years. Ironically, the driver returned the money to the hostel the following day. Glasse is buried in the churchyard of St. Mary‚Äôs Hanwell, the church where he was rector from 1785-1809, commemorated by a neo-classical tomb. Family In November 1783, Glasse married his cousin Anne Fletcher, and they had seven children. A year after her death in 1802, he was engaged briefly to Elizabeth de Blaquiere, who broke off the engagement. In 1804 he pursued Lady Anastasia Jessey Gascoigne of St. Petersburg, who had separated from her industrialist husband Charles Gascoigne. In October 1805, he married Harriet Wheeler, by whom he had one more child.

History  The Arcadia brand originated in Fleurier, a small village in Val-de-Travers region of the Canton of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland. Watchmaker Jules-Samuel Jequier was born in 1835 in Fleurier and joined Bovet after training as a jewel-cutter and quickly climbed up the company ladder. In 1858 he founded Arcadia and positioned it as the top-of the-line among the five watchmaking brands of the Fleurier Watch Company, a manufacturer established in 1915. The company specialised in jewel cutting and designing watch calibers and had federated watchmaking farmers into working cooperatively. Fleurier Watch Company supplied movements for over a century to many watch brands. While Arcadia had started off producing movements, this was followed several years later by a watch line. Arcadia was in fact one of the earliest brands to sell its watches around the world, including China and South America, and it was a creative, avant-garde brand that became the flagship of the Fleurier Watch Company. The brand sold watches until 1968, when, like so many mechanical watch companies, the advent of inexpensive quartz models led to its demise.\\"Watches: Vintage Victory\\". Robb Report, May 2011.

Designed at a time where torpedoes had become effective weapons and spurred the development of the Jeune √âcole, Greif was intended to guard the capital ships of the fleet against torpedo boat attacks. For this role, she carried a battery of and guns, unlike other German avisos of the period, which also carried torpedo tubes. Greif was not a successful warship, however, and she spent much of her career laid up, out of service. Completed in 1887, Greif was not commissioned until 1889, though she remained in service with the fleet only until October 1890, when she was assigned with torpedo testing, a role she filled until 1894 when she was decommissioned. Recommissioned in May 1897, she served as a fleet scout for the next two years, thereafter being reduced to secondary roles once again, including as a training ship, before being decommissioned for the last time in September 1900. Greif was struck from the naval register in 1912, hulked in 1915 during World War I, and used as a mine storage hulk in 1917. After the war, she was sold to ship breakers in 1921 and dismantled in Hamburg. Design By the 1880s, the development of torpedoes and torpedo boats had produced a weapons system that could effectively challenge powerful ironclad warships. This led to the development in France of the Jeune √âcole doctrine that emphasized the use of cheap torpedo boats and cruisers instead of expensive ironclads. As other navies, including Germany's, began to adopt the strategy, German planners saw the need for small warships capable of defending the fleet against attacking torpedo boats. The naval command called for a top speed of , which would allow the vessel to also operate as a scout for the fleet. To keep weight limited, the armament was to consist of a pair of guns. The ship proved to be a disappointment in service and she spent little time as a front-line combat unit. General characteristics Greif was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace , and at full loading, she displaced . Her hull was constructed with transverse steel frames and it contained twelve watertight compartments. Unlike the other avisos and cruiser- type vessels built for the German fleet at the time, Greif carried no armor protection. Greif was a mediocre sea boat and was moderately handy. She pitched slightly but rolled significantly more. Her transverse metacentric height was . The ship had a crew of seven officers and 163 enlisted men, though the latter later increased to 178. Greif carried several smaller boats, including one picket boat, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. Machinery Greifs propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2-cylinder double expansion engines built by AG Germania, which drove a pair of four-bladed screw propellers that were wide in diameter. Steam for the engines was provided by six cylindrical, double-ended, coal-fired fire-tube boilers split in three boiler rooms. Each boiler room was ducted into its own funnel. In 1906, she was reequipped with eight new cylindrical boilers in two boiler rooms, which slightly improved her performance. She was equipped with a pair of generators for electrical power; they had a combined output of at 67 volts. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The ship's propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of . On trials, Greif reached and . With the new boilers, her engines could reach and on speed trials. She could carry up to of coal, which provided a range of approximately at a cruising speed of . After her refit, she could carry of coal, which increased her range to at . Armament Unlike the other avisos built by the German navy, which carried torpedo tubes as their primary armament, Greif was armed only with guns. As built, the ship was armed with a main battery of two K L/35 guns placed in individual pivot mounts. She carried a secondary battery of ten Hotchkiss revolver cannon, also in individual pivot mounts. In 1906, the ship was rearmed with eight SK L/35 guns in single mounts and six revolver cannon. Later in her career, two of the 8.8 cm guns and two revolver cannon were removed. Service history Greif early in her career The keel for Greif was laid down in October 1885 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel. She was launched on 29 July 1886 and her christening was performed by Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Wilhelm von Wickede, the commander of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station). After completing fitting-out, she was commissioned for sea trials on 9 July 1887. Initial testing continued until 15 September and she was decommissioned in Kiel on 17 October. She remained out of service until 19 March 1889, when she was recommissioned in Wilhelmshaven for fishery protection patrols in the North Sea. She operated primarily off the East Frisian Islands during this period, though her duties to protect German territorial waters were interrupted from mid-March to mid-April to escort the screw corvette , which had Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard. Alexandrine was on her way to an overseas deployment, and Wilhelm II also wanted to greet the training squadron corvettes, which were returning from their cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. Greif again accompanied the Kaiser, this time aboard his yacht Hohenzollern on a cruise from 24 June to 10 August that saw the ships steam as far north as Nordkapp, Norway and then to Cowes, Britain. After returning to Germany, Greif served as a scout during fleet training exercises until 30 August. She was then decommissioned in Kiel on 30 September. On 10 October 1890, the navy established the Torpedo Trials Command to further develop the torpedo arm of the fleet; this work had previously been carried out by the Torpedo Workshop in Friedrichsort. Greif was attached to the command on 1 November to assist with testing operations in Kiel Bay. This work was interrupted on 2 April 1891 when Greif embarked Wilhelm II to greet the screw corvette , then returning from German East Africa, where the Abushiri revolt had recently been suppressed. On 10 June, Greif went into the dry dock at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for modernization, which included the replacement of her main battery. Work was completed on 21 August, followed by sea trials in Danzig Bay through November. The year 1892 passed uneventfully, with the only event of note being Greifs participation in the fleet training maneuvers from 30 August to 5 September. Greif underwent a thorough overhaul from 17 April 1893 to 2 October, thereafter returning to service with the Torpedo Trials Command. This duty ended on 31 October 1894 when she was decommissioned. She remained out of service until 5 May 1897, when she was recommissioned for service with the fleet as a scout and wireless support ship. She was assigned to II Division, I Squadron to support its flagship . As part of the unit, she took part in training exercises in the North Sea and later the Baltic, followed by a cruise in company with Wilhelm II and Kaiserin Augusta Victoria to Kronstadt, Russia in August. Upon the squadron's return to German waters later that month, the ships took part in the annual fleet maneuvers. Following their conclusion, Greif embarked Prince Heinrich of Prussia on 22 September; the torpedo boat had sunk in a severe storm in the mouth of the Elbe that day. Aboard had been Duke and Heinrich had wanted to take part in the search and salvage effort. Lithograph of Greif (left), (center), and (right) by Willy St√∂wer In December, Greif was assigned to I Division and she joined the battleships on a winter cruise to Christiana, Norway. While the divisional flagship, , was in dock for repairs, Greif served in her place from 29 December to 20 February 1898 with VAdm August von Thomsen aboard. Two days later, Grief herself went into dock for periodic maintenance, particularly to her boilers, which were badly worn out. Repairs were completed by 13 May, at which point she returned to I Squadron, joining the ships in Kirkwall, Scotland on 19 May. At the end of the month, she was reassigned to II Division, thereafter participating in the summer and autumn maneuvers that took place in the North and Baltic Seas. During the latter exercises, Greif collided with the torpedo boat on 23 August, though neither vessel was seriously damaged. She operated as part of I Scouting Group, which also included the aviso and the special ship . In the first half of December, Greif and the rest of II Division visited Swedish ports; she also served as the division flagship during this period, until 17 December. Greif was withdrawn from front-line service on 1 April 1899, thereafter taking part in experiments with wireless equipment. She was then assigned to the Naval Artillery Inspectorate as a training ship and was based in the Kieler F√∂rde. She rejoined the fleet to take part in the annual maneuvers from early August to 13 September. The ship then went into dry dock for another overhaul before returning to training duties. On 8 July 1900, she joined Hohenzollern for a cruise to Molde, Norway, and Esbjerg, Denmark, arriving back in Bremerhaven, Germany on 27 July. She again served as a fleet scout during the maneuvers in August and September that concluded in Swinem√ºnde on 15 September. She was decommissioned for the last time on 22 September and in 1901, underwent another thorough overhaul that included the installation of new boilers. She was transferred to the list of special ships on 21 June 1911, and on 25 October 1912, was struck from the naval register. During World War I, she was hulked on 25 October 1915 and used as a training ship for engine room crews; beginning in 1917, she was employed as a mine storage hulk, based in Kiel- Heikendorf. She was sold to ship breakers in Hamburg in 1921.

For example, an electronic survey method might influence results for those who might be unfamiliar with an electronic survey interface differently than for those who might be familiar. If measures are affected by CMV or common-method bias, the intercorrelations among them can be inflated or deflated depending upon several factors. Although it is sometimes assumed that CMV affects all variables, evidence suggests that whether or not the correlation between two variables is affected by CMV is a function of both the method and the particular constructs being measured. Remedies Ex ante remedies Several ex ante remedies exist that help to avoid or minimize possible common method variance. Important remedies have been compiled and discussed by Chang et al. (2010), Lindell & Whitney (2001) and Podsakoff et al. (2003). Ex post remedies Using simulated data sets, Richardson et al. (2009) investigate three ex post techniques to test for common method variance: the correlational marker technique, the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) marker technique, and the unmeasured latent method construct (ULMC) technique. Only the CFA marker technique turns out to provide some value, whereas the commonly used Harman test does not turn out to provide such value. A comprehensive example of this technique has been demonstrated by Williams et al. (2010). Kock (2015) discusses a full collinearity test that is successful in the identification of common method bias with a model that nevertheless passes standard convergent and discriminant validity assessment criteria based on a CFA.Kock, N.

In a career that lasted from July 1857 to June 1858, he ran seven times and won five races. He was unbeaten as a three-year-old and recorded his most important success in the 1858 Epsom Derby. He was retired to stud at the end of the season and became a successful stallion, siring the winners of several important races. Background Beadsman was a \\"blood-like, wiry-looking, but rather leggy\\" horse with a dark brown coat standing 15.2¬Ω hands high. He was bred by his owner Sir Joseph Hawley. Beadsman was sent into training with George Manning, at his stable at Cannons Heath, near Kingsclere in Hampshire, although decisions regarding his racing career were all made by Hawley. Manning's stable was converted barn and was not noted for its hygiene: a stagnant pond \\"where frogs and beetles revel\\" stood close by the entrance and was blamed for causing outbreaks of fever and \\"malaria\\" among the inmates. Beadsman‚Äôs sire, Weatherbit, was runner-up in the 1845 Goodwood Cup before going on to a successful stud career. His dam, Mendicant, was a \\"very superior racemare\\", winning the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks in 1846 before she was bought by Hawley in 1847. Racing career 1857: two-year-old season Beadsman was not highly tested as a two-year-old. He ran twice at Goodwood, and although he failed to win, he showed some promise. On 28 July in the ¬£100 Ham Stakes he dead-heated for third place behind the filly Blanche of Middlebie. Two days later, on Goodwood Cup day, he finished third to the easy winner Toxophilite in a ¬£200 Sweepstakes. 1858: three-year-old season Beadsman began his three-year-old season by beating Star of the East by a neck in a race at Newmarket in early April. He returned to the same course two weeks later for the second spring meeting and won twice. On 21 April he beat an unnamed colt by Collingwood out of Sneer to win a ¬£100 Sweepstakes. Two days later he was moved up in class to establish himself as a Derby contender in the Newmarket Stakes. He made most of the running and after what Bell's Life described \\"one of the finest races ever seen\\" finished in a dead-heat with Eclipse (by Orlando). Beadsman‚Äôs stable had another Derby contender in the 2000 Guineas winner Fitz-Roland and opinion concerning the colts‚Äô relative merits was divided. Manning felt that Fitz-Roland was better, but Hawley favoured Beadsman and the stable jockey John Wells, was undecided. Later stories claim that Hawley did everything he could to express public confidence in Fitz-Roland, causing Beadsman to be ignored and his odds for the Derby to lengthen. At Epsom on 19 May, Beadsman was ridden by Wells and started at odds of 10/1 in a field of twenty-three runners. Toxophilite, owned by the Prime Minister Lord Derby started favourite for the race which took place on an unusually hot day and attracted the customary huge crowd. Beadsman was settled just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in fourth place behind Fitz-Roland, Toxophilite and Eclipse. Fitz-Roland soon weakened and Toxophilite looked the likely winner until Wells produced Beadsman with a challenge inside the last quarter mile. Beadsman took the lead inside the final furlong and won comfortably by a length from Toxophilite with The Hadji staying on strongly for third. Many of the jockeys lost weight during the race and when Wells was checked afterwards he was found to be slightly below his registered weight. He had to add Beadsman‚Äôs bridle to the judge‚Äôs scales before he could pass the weigh-in. In his only race after the Derby, Beadsman won a Triennial Stakes at Stockbridge Racecourse. He was entered for at least three match races in the autumn, including one against the Cesarewitch winner Prioress, but none of these happened as either Hawley or the owner of Beadsman‚Äôs rival withdrew and paid a forfeit. Assessment Beadsman was generally regarded as the best horse in a mediocre year for three-year-olds. Stud career Beadsman was retired to his owner‚Äôs stud at Leybourne Grange in Kent, where he remained for the rest of his life apart from a period around 1866 when he stood at Middlethorpe in Yorkshire. Beadsman proved to be a successful stallion. He sired the Derby winner Blue Gown and the St Leger winner Pero Gomez among other good winners. He died after a \\"short but severe\\" illness on 5 July 1872. Pedigree *Beadsman was inbred 3x4 to Tramp. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Ucanal Stela 6 is badly eroded but the name of Itzamnaaj Bahlam can be seen at Glyph A4a. The date on this monument cannot be read but stylistically the stela fits better in the late eighth century than in the late seventh century, and it seems more likely that this monument refers to a later Ucanal king of the same name.

The plot focuses on a young woman who is terrorized in her family vacation home while cleaning the property with her father and uncle. The film is a remake of the 2010 Uruguayan film, La Casa Muda ( English:The Silent House), which was allegedly based on an actual incident that occurred in a village in Uruguay in the 1940s. It is notable for its use of \\"real time\\" footage and the manufactured appearance of a single continuous shot, similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011 and was subsequently purchased by Open Road Films and Universal Pictures for distribution. Silent House premiered in United States theaters on March 9, 2012. It opened at number 5 at the U.S. box office, earning $6.6 million during its opening weekend; it would go on to gross a total of $12.8 million domestically. Plot A young woman named Sarah is staying at her family's dilapidated Victorian house in the countryside with her father John and her uncle Peter, helping them fix it to be put up for sale. After a petty argument between John and Peter, Peter leaves and drives into town for extra tools. Sarah meets a young woman named Sophia at the front door. Sophia claims to be one of Sarah's childhood friends, though Sarah does not remember her. Soon after, Sarah panics when she hears John falling down the stairs. She tries to leave the house but all exits are blocked, and she hides from an unknown perpetrator. She finds John unconscious with a head wound and runs to the basement in search of the cellar door that leads outside. She finds a bed and other evidence that someone else has been living there, possibly squatters. She sees a figure searching for her and escapes out the cellar door. Outside, she meets Peter, who has returned, and sees a young girl on the road who disappears. Peter and Sarah discover John's body missing in the house. When the power is cut off, the only light source available to them is the flash on a Polaroid camera. Through a series of camera flashes, Sarah sees the young girl and a man in the room. The power returns to reveal Peter missing. Sarah hides while two men take pictures, presumably pedophilic in nature, of an unseen girl. Sarah tries to shoot one of the men with Peter's gun, then hides in her room and begins to show signs of paranoia and psychosis. She experiences hallucinations of traumatic childhood events, including a bloodstain on the bed and the young girl in the bathtub with beer bottles and bloody water. Frightened, Sarah flees and runs into Sophia. John, now conscious, is wrapped in plastic and sitting in the living room. Sophia gives Sarah a key to a box containing pedophilic pictures of Sarah as a little girl, implying that John sexually abused her. It is suggested that her recent interactions and hallucinations with the little girl and mystery attacker have been a traumatic repressed memory. Events at the house have caused this memory to reappear, and Sarah is now exacting her revenge. She has been confusing the events of her childhood with what she is doing now, likely due to dissociative identity disorder. She assaults John and Peter in her \\"intruder\\" mode while simultaneously wandering the house as a victim trying to escape. The \\"intruder\\" drags Peter into the living room before it is revealed that it's actually Sarah herself. Sophia also turns out to be a figment of her imagination. John convinces Sarah to untie him, then whips her with his belt. Peter tries to stop him but John mocks Peter's pleas. As his back is turned, Sarah bludgeons his head with a sledgehammer, killing him. Peter begs for mercy and tells her he should have stopped the rape and abuse from the hands of John. Sarah leaves him and walks out silently. Cast *Elizabeth Olsen as Sarah *Adam Trese as John *Eric Sheffer Stevens as Peter *Julia Taylor Ross as Sophia *Adam Barnett as Stalking Man *Haley Murphy as Little Girl Production Development The script for the film was written by Laura Lau, and based on the Uruguayan film La casa muda (2010). According to Lau, she saw the original film twice and wrote the script for the remake based on the viewings rather than adapting it from paper. The script ultimately came out to around fifty-five to sixty pages,Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:20:27) which left the filmmakers concerned as to whether or not the timing would translate during filming: \\"We wondered whether it would time out properly, because there are no cuts,\\" said Lau. \\"There‚Äôs no way to fix anything in post, it has to pace perfectly when you shoot it. So I think that was a huge challenge in terms of writing the script.\\" Upon acquiring the house used for filming, Lau re-wrote the script in order for it to be compatible with the restrictions and characteristics of the house.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:21:04) In terms of the film's unique presentation (being presented as a single take following one character), Lau said: \\"This entire movie is this woman's experience; it is her reality [...] it is one character's point of view, it's exactly what she's experiencing.\\" She also stated that several aspects of the film were purposefully left open for interpretation.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:25:00) While writing the script for the film, Lau did extensive research on childhood sexual abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from psychological trauma.Kentis & Lau 2012 (1:05:02) Although the film's marketing campaign (as well as the promotion for the original film La casa muda) states that it is inspired by actual events, the specific events are not entirely known. According to Lau, she and Kentis were told, when approached to make the film, that it was based on an occurrence in Uruguay, though the details were left ambiguous: In terms of casting, Kentis and Lau sought an actress with theatrical training due to the demanding nature of the filming process; Elizabeth Olsen was cast as the lead after impressing Kentis and Lau with her audition. Filming The movie was shot with Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras between October and November 2010 on location at a house in New Rochelle, New York. The house used in the film was found by directors Kentis and Lau entirely empty, and was wallpapered and filled with props and furniture by the production design.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:15:00) Due to the unique nature of the film's presentation as a single take, the production crew ran into several technical issues while filming, mainly surrounding lighting issues and mobility around the house. Since filming was carried out in 12-15 minute takes, there were several occurrences where entire sequences had to be thrown out and re-done repeatedly due to lighting problems or missed cues.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:06:50; 0:35:22) Although the promotional material for the film suggests that it was filmed in real time in a single long take, Elizabeth Olsen revealed that the movie was actually filmed in 12-minute takes and edited so as to appear as one, which was later confirmed by Kentis and Lau.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:05:32) Directors Kentis and Lau stated that they were inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) and Russian Ark (2002), both purported single take films, as well as the home invasion thriller The Strangers (2008). Due to the unconventional filming process and storytelling mode, Kentis felt he was making an \\"experimental film.\\"Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:28:01) He also stated that the presentation and storytelling mode of the film as a single take was the main focus of the production, and that the fact that there were cuts in the film was irrelevant.Kentis & Lau 2012 (0:28:34) Release The world premiere of the film was at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, as part of the \\"Park City at Midnight\\" program; Kentis, Lau, and Olsen also appeared. It was released theatrically in the United States on March 9, 2012. Box office The film opened at number 5 at the United States box office, earning $6,661,234 during its opening weekend, showing on 2,124 screens. It would go on to show in theaters until late April 2012, grossing a total of $12,754,783 domestically. In foreign markets, it grossed a total of USD$346,889. Critical reception , the film has an approval rating of 43% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 134 reviews, with an average rating based on 5.22 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Silent House is more technically proficient and ambitious than most fright-fests, but it also suffers from a disappointing payoff.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 30 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film received a harsh reception from audiences, earning an \\"F\\" grade from CinemaScore surveys (only the second movie of the year to receive the failing grade along with The Devil Inside); , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised Olsen's performance and the cinematography. Some publications, such as The Daily Telegraph, applauded Olsen's performance, calling it \\"brilliantly nervy and detailed\\", while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said Olsen \\"isn't as interesting as she was in Martha Marcy May Marlene\\", and said the film, despite being atmospheric, \\"feels like a copy\\". Nonetheless, he awarded the film a 3/5 star rating. The Star Tribune described the film as \\"a psychotic episode come to life\\", and that it \\"follows the form of a Gothic novel\\", applauding it as being \\"impressive and oppressive\\". Others praised the technical production of the film, such as The Atlantic, who noted \\"the camera's unblinking eye constantly stays with Olsen, and we feel in as much danger as she is.\\" Jonathan Crocker of Total Film described the camera as \\"gliding with impressive agility, the queasy HD lensing closes in tight and tracks Olsen‚Äôs petrified face, room to room\\", and, although critical of the film's ending, called the film \\"brutally effective\\" and \\"a fun campfire horror tale\\". Other critics found the film's technicality unappealing, with Rob Gonsalves of eFilmcritic saying \\"the underlit setting occasionally produces unsettling, suggestive imagery, but the technique took me out of the movie,\\" while The Observer accused the film of \\"wasting the talent of Elizabeth Olsen.\\" The staff of The A.V. Club named it one of the worst movies of 2012, noting its \\"mediocrity takes a downward turn in a final act that hinges on an icky, exploitative twist.\\" Roger Ebert awarded the film two out of four stars, writing: \\"My attention was held for the first act or so. Then any attempt at realism was abandoned, and it became clear that the house, and the movie containing it, were devices to manufacture methodical thrills. The explanation, if that's what it was, seemed devised and unconvincing.\\" David Edelstein of Vulture praised the film, defending it against the perceived critical backlash, writing: \\"It‚Äôs odd that the CinemaScore rating for Silent House, a more than decent gimmicky scare picture that opened last Friday, is an ‚ÄúF‚Äù ‚Äî suggesting that critics like me are more excited by formal inventiveness than most of the film-going public.\\" In a 2017 retrospective by Film School Rejects, Silent House was named one of the most \\"underrated\\" horror films of the twenty-first century. Psychologist Sharon Packer notes the film as an example of dissociative identity disorder in contemporary horror films, alongside other genre films such as High Tension (2005) and The Uninvited (2009).

Kelly that explains the first complete ontology of influence, known as The Standard Influence Decision System, sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúThe Playmaker‚Äôs Standard.‚Äù In its review of the book, The Wall Street Journal lauded Kelly for ‚Äúmaking us look at the time- worn faces of the business world in a fresh and freshly ordered way.‚ÄùThe Plan Behind That Power Play, The Wall Street Journal.

Retrieved 2012-01-15 The book's publication led to the formation of a consultancy, called Playmaker Systems, LLC, and a series of self-service and for-pay web-tools and apps that further explicate the decision support system.  Overview  In the text, Kelly breaks down the most basic units of influence, called influence stratagems ‚Äì colloquially referred to as ‚Äúplays‚Äù ‚Äì which practitioners of influence employ for mutual and competitive advantage. According to Kelly, plays underlie all aspects of the influence industries ‚Äì examples being marketing, public affairs, public relations, information warfare, IO/MISO, psy ops, law, diplomacy, politics, sales, positioning, and rhetorical debate ‚Äì and are employed regardless of skill-set and discipline. The Elements of Influence presents the Standard Table of Influence, a classification of the units of influence into an ontology. The Standard Table of Influence consists of 25 irreducibly unique influence stratagems (since revised down to 24, see below), organized by a three-class and eight-subclass superstructure. The table's concise organization into a stable decision-support system for influence has led some practitioners to refer to it as ‚Äúthe Rosetta Stone of influence.‚ÄùKelly, Alan.

To put a precise date on the text's genesis would be September 5, 1995.

Wired Magazine. Online. Retrieved 2012-01-27 It was from this that Kelly derived one of the first plays, the Call Out.‚Äù  Contents  In The Elements of Influence, Kelly makes the case for the development of influence strategy as an applied discipline in the Preface, Introduction and in Section I, titled \\"The Basics of Playmaking.\\" He then orders each chapter sequentially in Section II, \\"The Playmaker‚Äôs Table,\\" to explain each of the system's influence plays. In Section III, titled \\"Methods and Variables of Playmaking,\\" Kelly lays out supporting principles of influence strategy. Lastly, in Section IV, the author closes with anecdotal stories of the making of The Playmaker's Standard, a Conclusion, Acknowledgements, an Appendix of Play Action Maps, Notes, a Glossary, an Index of Figures and Tables, and a general Index. Once ordered, Kelly moved beyond classification and into the system's ontological structure. In Section II, titled \\"The Playmaker‚Äôs Table,\\" the author provides details pertaining to each influence play. Now called ‚ÄúStandard Guidance,‚Äù these details consist of the Class and Subclass to which the play belongs; Upsides and Downsides of employing the play; Related Terms to the play, especially those which are colloquial and/or found in common literature; Related Plays; Examples of the play being deployed in business, politics, popular culture and in a military context; Best Practices for Decoding the play if it's being employed against you; Best Practices for employing the play on your own behalf; and plays by which one can reliably Counter the play if it's been deployed against a focal player.  Use and Application  The Elements of Influence has been used as the principal or as a supporting text in numerous undergraduate and graduate courses at The Graduate School of Political Management at The George Washington UniversityThe George Washington University, Graduate School Of Political Management Course Schedule and Lipscomb University.Students hear secrets to communication strategy straight from national leader. Lipscomb University. Kelly himself uses the book to teach political management graduate courses at the George Washington University entitled \\"The Elements of Influence\\". Version 2.0 On September 17, 2012, Kelly released a white paper detailing the changes to the system after five years of use in the marketplace. The most notable difference between the first and second versions is the reduction of the table from 25 to 24 influence plays and from eight to seven subclasses, emphasized by a visual redesign. Other Media An iOS app based on the Standard Table of Influence was released on September 5, 2012. It is based on a revised release of the table, which has been reduced to 24 distinct plays, down from the book's 25.

The total combined enrollment of the student body that year was 118. Over the years, classes were expanded to include students in upper grades so that, by 1973, Calvary Baptist provided education through grade twelve. That same year, the school held graduation ceremonies for its first class of seniors. In 2005, school administrators also established a preschool program. Initial enrollment at the Foundations Christian Preschool included 21 preschool and kindergarten students, and recently reached a high of 125 students with total enrollment for 2018 from preschool through grade twelve reaching more than 460.

Hynds and donated to the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1922. It is open from May 1 to October 1 by reservation only. It has accommodations for 30 people (max occupancy of 90), a large kitchen, dining room, living room, covered porch, stone fireplace and chimney, and of land. The lodge was originally used by Wyoming Boy Scouts as a recreational camp. Later it was used by churches, social groups, and businesses. It was built on land that became part of Curt Gowdy State Park in 1971 and is now operated by the park. The south fork of Crow Creek lies nearby, with a granite outcrop and woodlands of cedar and spruce. The lodge has many large trees around it, towering granite behind it, and is built into a hillside. Its construction with granite stone in ashlar masonry gives it a unique architectural style. The University of Wyoming's Department of Geology and Geophysics offers summer field courses in the area of the park and stays at the lodge. The lodge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 23, 1984. Hynds arrived in Cheyenne in 1882 from Illinois. He began working as a blacksmith but in 1883 he acquired the first of several gambling saloons. This made him quite wealthy and he entered other businesses and also became an philanthropist. He was a founder of Frontier Days Rodeo. The Boy Scouts of America was very popular in Cheyenne by 1922 and their leadership approached him to help raise money for a cabin. Instead, Hynds paid for the cabin himself. The cabin was completed in the summer of 1922 and measures 36' x 35'. The lodge was operated by the Young Men's Literary Club for the Boy Scouts until 1935, when the City of Cheyenne took over. Many civic organizations have used it since, including the Boy Scouts. Major repair efforts were made in 1966. In 1971, the lodge and its land were leased to the Wyoming Recreation Commission by the City of Cheyenne.

This species occurs on the tidal flats of mangrove forests where it readily crosses mud and sand surfaces out of the water, using its pectoral fins to move. Distribution Periophthalmus barbarus is found throughout West Africa, in mangrove swamps and primarily brackish bodies of water near the coast. Countries where the mudskipper are found include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Ghana Usage by humans It is important to local indigenous peoples as a food fish and can also be found in the aquarium trade. Fishing has caused population declines in parts of the species' range. Diet Periophthalmus barbarus is an omnivore. In the wild, mudskippers prefer to eat worms, crickets, flies, meal worms, beetles, small fish, and small crustaceans (sesarmid crabs). Mudskippers kept as pets can eat frozen fare such as bloodworm or artemia and flake. It cannot eat dried food, however, because its stomach would swell up. It is recommended to feed it frozen food for a healthy diet. Characteristics Periophthalmus barbarus and mudskippers generally are able to tolerate high concentrations of toxic substances produced by industrial waste, including cyanide, in their environments. They are also able to survive in a variety of environments, including waters with different temperatures and salinity levels.

The genus is known solely from early Middle Cambrian fossils found in Europe. The genus currently contains a solitary accepted species, Camya asy. Description Camya asy is a small bivalve which was first described in 1995 by Ingelore Hinz-Schallreuter. The genus and species are based on the fossils of two juvenile specimens which are both incomplete due to only the left valve of each being recovered. The fossils were found in sediments of the middle Cambrian aged Exsulans limestone which outcrops on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The valves have a distinct subtriangular shape and possess a long straight hinge. The umbo is positioned notably anterior on the shell and the beak is bracketed by two teeth of indistinctly pyramidal shape. The presence of the teeth was later questioned in a 1998 study by G. Geyer and M. Streng and cited the lack of preserved muscle scars as reason to suspect the placement of Camya asy in Bivalvia. The family Camyidae was first proposed by Hinz-Schallreuter in a 2000 paper discussing the Cambrian bivalves from Bornholm and reviewing the proposed Cambrian bivalve taxa of the time. In the same paper, Hinz-Schallreuter noted that the species Modiolopsis thecoides, known from one specimen which is now lost, most likely belonged to Camya. As of 2011 the family has been placed as a sister taxon to the family Fordillidae in the Superfamily Fordilloidea.

Its assets include many publicly owned lands within Texas and various other investments; as of the end of fiscal 2014 (August 31), the fund had an endowment of $36.3 billion. The fund is distinct from the Permanent University Fund, which funds most institutions in the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M; University System, but no other public universities or schools in the state. Management The lands and other assets in the fund are managed by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). Money is added to the fund whenever lands under GLO management are sold or leased, or when mineral royalties are collected on natural resource extraction on these lands. Royalties on oil and gas extraction are the fund's major source of revenues. The General Land Office then reinvests these revenues and manages the investments. The interest produced by the fund's investments is distributed to the state's public school districts (in proportion to their average daily student attendance), but the fund itself may not be spent; this provision ensures that the fund will continue to grow, and its revenues will be available for Texas public schools in perpetuity. History and enlargement In 1854 an act of the Texas Legislature established the Special School Fund (a predecessor to the Permanent School Fund), intended to fund the state's public school system. The fund was endowed with $2 million taken from the money paid to Texas by the federal government in return for Texas's claimed territory in what are now parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, in 1876 Texas enacted a new constitution which changed the fund's name to the Permanent School Fund and transferred half of the public lands owned by the state to the fund as its new endowment. The 1876 constitution also tasked the General Land Office with the management of these lands and the fund. In 1953, the United States Congress passed the Submerged Lands Act, which returned to the States the navigable territorial waters that had been historically the property of the States. Because Texas's historical territorial waters originated with its period as a sovereign state, the US Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Louisiana (1960) that Texas was in the unique position of owning territory out to three leagues (10.35 miles) from its coastline. These lands were also added to the Permanent School Fund, further enlarging its assets.

The superfamily is known from fossils of early to middle Cambrian age found in North America, Greenland, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.The Paleobiology Database Fordillidae entry accessed 4 January 2012The Paleobiology Database Fordilla entry accessed 4 January 2012 Fordillidae currently contains two genera, Fordilla and Pojetaia each with up to three described species while Camyidae only contains a single genus Camya with one described species, Camya asy. Due to the size and age of the fossil specimens, Fordillidae species are included as part of the Turkish Small shelly fauna. Description Fordilla are small bivalves with valves that are equal in size and suboval in shape. In size, Fordilla specimens reach a total shell length of up to and a height of . The shells are compressed laterally and the back edge is slightly broadened. The rear adductor is less developed and smaller than the front adductor, while the small pedal retractor muscle scar is positioned near the front adductor scar. The valve hinge is usually straight to slightly convexly curved and each valve will have at most one tooth present. The external surface of the shell occasionally shows faint ribbing. Similar to Fordilla, species of Pojetaia are small, with valves to less than in length. Pojetaia species have an overall shape which is suboval, with the subequal valves slightly elongated. The ligament is straight with an umbo which is central to subcentral. In contrast to Fordilla, the rear adductor muscle was larger and more developed than the front adductor, with pallial muscles arranged along the valve margins. Also in contrast to Fordilla, valves of Pojetaia possess between one and three teeth, with up to two teeth per valve. The exteriors of the shells show faint ribbing and fine comarginal growth lines. Camya is based on the fossils of two juvenile specimens which are both incomplete due to only the left valve of each being recovered. The valves have a distinct subtriangular shape and possess a long straight hinge. The umbo is positioned notably anterior on the shell and the beak is bracketed by two teeth of indistinctly pyramidal shape. The presence of the teeth was later questioned in a 1998 study by G. Geyer and M. Streng and cited the lack of preserved muscle scars as reason to suspect the placement of Camya asy in Bivalvia. The inner shell layers of Fordilla and Pojetaia species both consist of layers of carbonate which is akin to the laminar aragonite layer found in extant monoplacophora. The structuring is similar to shell layering found in the extinct genera Anabarella and Watsonella which is thought to suggest members of the phylum Mollusca developed nacre independently several times. Of the four accepted bivalve genera to have been described from the Cambrian, Fordilloidea contains three, Camya, Fordilla, and Pojetaia, with the remaining genus Tuarangia in the possibly related order Tuarangiida.

National Defence is the largest department of the Government of Canada in terms of budget as well as staff. It also is the department with the largest number of buildings (6,806 in 2015). The department is headed by the Deputy Minister of National Defence, who is the department‚Äôs senior civil servant, and reports directly to the Minister of National Defence. The Department of National Defence exists to aid the minister in carrying out his responsibilities within the Defence Portfolio and provides a civilian support system for the Canadian Armed Forces. Under the National Defence Act, the Canadian Armed Forces is a completely separate and distinct organization from, and is not part of, the Department of National Defence. History National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada The Department of National Defence was established by the National Defence Act, which merged the Department of Militia and Defence (which was created in 1906 when the British Army withdrew its forces stationed in Canada), the Department of Naval Services (the department responsible for the administration of the Royal Canadian Navy), and the Air Board (which oversaw aviation in Canada). The National Defence Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada on June 28, 1922. Organization 400px Both the Canadian Armed Forces (military) and the Department of National Defence (civilian civil servants) are, although two separate organizations, known collectively as The Defence Team as both institutions work closely together in the defence of Canada. The Minister of National Defence, as the member of cabinet responsible to Parliament for National Defence, heads the Defence Team. The Department of National Defence is headed by the Deputy Minister of National Defence. Under the Deputy Minister are a variety of associate deputy and assistant deputy ministers who are responsible for various aspects of the department (human resources, policy, etc.). The Deputy Minister is appointed by the Governor-General on behalf of the Queen of Canada (Queen-in-Council) on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Canadian Armed Forces, as a separate and distinct organization, is headed by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and reporting to him are the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, and a variety of other commands. There are also a variety of offices and support organizations which report to both the Chief of Defence Staff and the Deputy Minister. The Canadian Sovereign, represented by the Governor General, is responsible for appointing the Minister, Deputy Minister, and Chief of Defence Staff on the recommendation of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada. Although not part of the Defence Team organizational structure, the legal military chain of command within the Canadian Forces originates from the Queen of Canada as Commander-in-Chief (represented by the Governor-General), through the Chief of the Defence Staff to all military officers by virtue of their holding of the Queen‚Äôs Commission, and thus through them to all members of the Canadian Armed Forces. Defence portfolio The Minister of National Defence is responsible for the entire Defence Portfolio comprising several organizations, including the Canadian Armed Forces, the Communications Security Establishment, Defence Research and Development Canada, and the Department of National Defence, amongst others. The department is not responsible for all of these organizations itself but rather exists to support the minister in carrying out all of his duties within the Defence Portfolio. The Canadian Forces are a distinct and separate entity from the Department of National Defence. Special duty operations The Canadian military has two classes of what they call \\"operations\\", where soldiers are deployed from their base to attain a particular objective. An example of the normal type of operation might be drills and training in NATO exercises. Only those operations classed \\"special duty operations\\" allow participating soldiers to receive long-term veterans benefits should the need arise.

A stream rises in Holy Vale and flows south through Higher Moors to the sea at Porth Hellick. In its half-mile length it falls less than 25 feet and has barely cut a river bed through the marsh; but feeds the pool with fresh water. The area is an important feeding station for migrating and wintering birds and was designated as the Higher Moors and Porth Hellick Pool (St Mary's) Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for the ‚Ä≥wide diversity of habitats with several rare and notable plant species‚Ä≥ in 1971. Natural history Higher Moors and Porth Hellick Pool SSSI is one of the three main freshwater wetland areas on Scilly. The wetland is fed by ground water and a small steam to form a mosaic of willow and alder scrub, mire and pools. The peat deposits were once a fuel source and are rich in pollen. Along with other paleo-environmental evidence the deposits provide information about the vegetational history of the islands since the Mesolithic. The area is important as a feeding ground for migrating and wintering birds and for summer visitors and waterfowl. Reed Warbler and Sedge Warbler nest in the common reed which grows along the margins of the pools and Coot, Gadwall, Mallard and Moorhen, Teal and Water Rail also breed. The moors were once grazed and the fields have a rich wet grassland flora with Greater Tussock-sedge, Hemlock Water-dropwort, Purple Loosestrife, Royal Fern, Water Mint and Yellow Iris.

It was issued by decree on September 3.  Background  Article 76 of the Constitution bans possession of firearms within by members of Parliament while in session, likely as a response to the fatal shooting by Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá of several members of the Croatian Peasant Party in 1928.

Maung advocated a conciliatory approach toward Myanmar's ruling military junta, which seized power in 1988. Maung argued that Burma could be moved towards democratization by working directly with the country's generals, rather than confronting them. Maung sometimes took political positions which proved controversial among Burma's opposition leaders, who often viewed his ties to the military government with suspicion. He stated that Aung San Suu Kyi should accept a new constitution written by the military as a token of goodwill. He believed that Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) should only contest half the parliamentary seats in the 2010 general election, arguing that a landslide win for the NLD would scare the Burmese rulers into holding onto power. However, Maung heavily criticized the generals for rigging the 2010 general election when the extent of voter fraud became known. (The NLD ultimately boycotted the election). Maung grew up in Maymyo (also called Pyin U Lwin), where his parents were history department faculty members at the Defence Services Academy. From the 7th to 10th standards, he was selected as a Luyaygyun (·Äú·Ä∞·Äõ·Ää·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫), a nationally recognized well-rounded student. Maung attended a regional college, where he majored in Biology, before he was admitted into medical school. He graduated from the Institute of Medicine 1 in Rangoon (now Yangon) with a medical degree in 1987, after repeating his 2nd year. Maung did not ally himself with the National League for Democracy or its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. He died form alliances with other opposition figures, such as Zarganar. Maung met with Aung San Suu Kyi in January 2011, shortly after her release from house arrest. Maung left Burma for four months in 2004 to attend the Yale World Fellows Program at Yale University in the United States, focusing on public policy. In 2006, Nay founded Myanmar Egress, a civil society organizations with other intellectuals, which he hoped would thaw relations between the government and other pro-democracy activists. Nay hoped Myanmar Egress, which was headquartered in a hotel in Yangon, to evolve into a Western-style economic and political think tank. Under Nay, Myanmar Egress gave classes and seminars in business skills, economics, democracy, and entrepreneurship. In 2008, Egress the relief effort in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, earning accolades from international and foreign relief organizations. In March 2011, Burmese President Thein Sein called for reforms and good governance in his inauguration speech, leading to a series of reforms throughout 2011 and 2012. Maung, who had long advocated a conciliatory tone towards the generals, saw his ideas gain new prominence during the reform period and opposition leaders gradually warmed to his ideas. The vice president of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Maung Maung Lay, who represents business interests, told the Wall Street Journal, \\"We thought that he was pro-government...{but} he seems to [have been] impartial\\" as reforms accelerated and progressed in Burma. Maung died from heart attack on January 1, 2012, at the age of 49. He was survived by his wife Win Kalayar Swe, three daughters, one son. At his funeral, wreaths from both the ruling government's Minister of Industry and NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi were placed next to each other. Tributes from fellow pro-democracy activists, who had previously criticized his relations with the government, appeared in Twitter and Facebook. Likewise, the government also praised his efforts. Ye Htut, a spokesperson for the Burmese Ministry of Information stated, \\"Now we are at the beginning of the democratization process and losing him at this stage is a great loss...He foresaw that the new constitution would bring political space for democratization and urged all stakeholders to participate in the 2010 elections, but few people believed him and attacked him.\\"Paul Pasch: Dr. Nay Win Maung ‚Äì A Man with a Vision and a Plan; https://www.facebook.com/NayWinMaung.Dr/posts/259051737496137.

He was the eldest son of William Cockburn of Ormiston and Janet Somerville.Cockburn- Hood, (1888), 123-4. John was usually called \\"Ormiston.\\" During his lifetime there was also a laird of Ormiston in Teviotdale near Eckford, a member of the rival Hepburn family. A Scottish Protestant in the Rough Wooing Earl of Bothwell John Cockburn was a prominent Protestant and also on good terms with England, having a licence to trade there during the war of the Rough Wooing. He was pardoned for communing with the English during Lord Hertford's expedition in 1544. John Knox was tutor to one of his sons, and the Protestant preacher and martyr George Wishart was arrested by James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, the Sheriff of Haddingtonshire, at his House of Ormiston on 16 January 1546. After negotiation Bothwell took Wishart away to nearby Elphinstone Castle. Soon after on the same night, soldiers of the Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran, arrived to arrest John, his nephew Sandilands of Calder, and Alexander Crichton of Brunstane. Brunstane escaped but his two companions were imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle. John escaped from the castle one morning by going over the wall.Works of John Knox, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 140-142. John, and his younger brother Ninian Cockburn were amongst those accused of the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546. In September 1547 he is said to have guided the English army through the Lammermuirs to the battle of Pinkie. In January 1548, William Patten published the names of John Cockburn and 36 other Scottish lairds and gentleman who had sworn an oath on 23 September 1547 to be loyal to Edward VI of England.An English Garner: Tudor Tracts, (1903), pp. 146-7, re-printing Patten, William, The Expedition into Scotland (London, 1548). John and Alexander Crichton of Brunstane tried to hold three houses on behalf of Grey of Wilton, who occupied Haddington. Ormiston and Brunstane waited for an opportunity to capture Edinburgh Castle and deliver Regent Arran and the Bishop of Dunkeld to the English. They also wanted Grey of Wilton to capture and garrison the Earl of Bothwell's house at Hailes Castle.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 57, 59. They wrote jointly to John Luttrell, the English commander of Broughty Castle on 17 January 1548 asking him to allow fishermen from Crail to supply them.Cameron, Annie I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS: Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 211-213. The Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran captured the House of Ormiston. Gatehouse of the Kepier Hospital in Durham given to John Cockburn by Edward VI of England John tried to defend the House of Saltoun but his men were inadequately armed. At the end of February 1548 Arran brought four cannon to Saltoun; three cut-throats mounted on carts, and a single-falcon.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 150. Five of Cockburn's men were killed in the fight, and five were captured and hanged.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 88-89. The Privy Council of Scotland declared him a traitor on 29 February 1548 and ordered the demolition of Ormiston House.HMC, 11th report part vi, Manuscripts of the Duke of Hamilton (London, 1887), p. 39. John and Crichton of Brunstane went into exile in England. On 25 March 1548, the English Privy Council gave him ¬£65 as the King's reward for the losses in Scotland. Edward VI sent John a letter reassuring him of his goodwill in March 1550, as peace was declared between Scotland and England.Dasent, J. R., ed., Acts of the Privy Council of England, 1547-1552, vol. 2 (London, 1890), pp. 178-9, 417. For his services to the Protestant cause, on 13 March 1552, Edward VI rewarded John Cockburn with the lands and income belonging to the Hospital of St Giles in Durham known as the Kepier Hospital. John sold all these lands to the Heath family by 1564.Cockburn-Hood, (1888), 127. Arrested on the border John must have found the Catholic regime of Mary Tudor less congenial, and in April 1555 he tried to return to Scotland without a passport. He was arrested by Master Norton, Captain of Norham Castle and became a prisoner of the Bishop of Durham. The English privy council was interested in his case and the 2,000 crowns cash he was rumoured to have been carrying. He was also deemed to owe ¬£105 from the Durham Hospital, as Mary and Philip were reclaiming properties for the church. John was transferred to the Fleet Prison in London. He finally came before the Privy Council on 22 December 1555, where his offence was called a \\"March treason.\\" John was pardoned and given permission to seek redress for the money confiscated at Norham. He declared that he would not pursue his money.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol.5 (1892), 119, 166, 177, 205, 206. Scottish Reformation Crisis John was forfeited as a traitor by the Parliament of Scotland on 5 December 1548, for his crimes in January 1548 of assisting Grey of Wilton, keeping the House of Saltoun, and persuading lieges of Scotland to form leagues against Mary, Queen of Scots. On 5 December 1558, the forfeiture was reversed on the grounds that the procedure was flawed because Alexander was out of the country at the time. The sentence against Crichton of Brunstane was withdrawn in the same terms on the same day.National Archives of Scotland, PA2/10, f.38r-41v., digitised by Records of the Parliaments of Scotland: St Andrews University During the crisis of the Scottish Reformation, John, laird of Ormiston took his followers to face the French troops at Cupar Muir in June 1559.Knox, John, Works: History of the Reformation, vol.1 (1846), pp. 350-3 On 31 October 1559 he was involved in a major setback for the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Ormiston rode to Berwick upon Tweed and carried ¬£1,000 or 6,000 crowns from England to aid their fight against French troops in Scotland . The Earl of Bothwell ambushed him near Haddington and took the money after a sword fight which left John with a wounded face. This caused diplomatic embarrassment as the English were caught out aiding Mary of Guise's rebels.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.258-259, 262. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph asked Mary to make a full re-instatement of John as laird of Ormiston in 1562. Randolph spent a day at Ormiston on 30 December 1562, while Mary was at Dunbar, and wrote a letter to his master, William Cecil, while he was there.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.674-5 Randolph listed John amongst those who assisted in the murder of the Queen's Italian secretary David Rizzio in March 1566, with two relatives; his son-in-law the laird of \\"Haughton\\" (Herdmanston), and his nephew Sandilands of Calder, and John Crichton, laird of Brunstane, the son of his friend.CSP Scotland, vol.2 (1900), pp.269-70. Two contemporary sources state that John Cockburn came to support Queen Mary and Bothwell at the battle of Carberry Hill in 1567.Thomson, Thomas, ed.,The Historie of James the Sext, Banntyne Club (1825), 14: Laing, Malcolm, History of Scotland with a Preliminary Dissertation on the Participation of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the Murder of Darnley, vol. 2 (1819), p.114 Thomas Randolph wrote to John Cockburn in April 1571, saying he had heard from Francis Walsingham, the English ambassador in France, that his son Alexander Cockburn, a student, was in good health.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (1903), p.521 John Cockburn had a stroke on the High Street of Edinburgh on 22 November 1583 and died.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 663. Family By 1535, John married Alison Sandilands, (d.1584) daughter of Sir John Sandilands of Calder. John's coat-of-arms was carved at Mid Calder Church in 1541; a fesse cheque between three cocks. The published edition of Henry Balnaves's Confession of Faith was dedicated to Alison Sandilands. Balnaves wrote the book while a prisoner in the Old Palace of Rouen in 1548. The book was published by Thomas Vautrollier in 1584. Vautrollier said Alison's and Knox's secretary Richard Bannatyne had found the manuscript in the hands of a child at Ormiston.Stuart, John, 'Armorial Bearings at Mid- Calder', in PSAS vol. 3 (1862), p.170 citing Knox Works, vol.1 (1846), p.226, 236 footnotes: Balnaves, Henry, (1584), available EEBO, (Vautrollier's preface corrects Stuart's remarks and notes in Knox's Works.)

Early life He was born in 1874 in Christchurch. Bishop Harper and Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet were his grandfathers; John Acland was his father and Jack Acland, MP for in the 1940s, was his son. Acland was one of the first in New Zealand who confined their medical practice to surgery. He joined the New Zealand Medical Corps for World War I and survived the sinking of the SS Marquette. In 1924, Acland bought Chippenham Lodge in Browns Road, St Albans, which had previously belonged to John Evans Brown. His family lived there for the rest of his life. Acland was knighted in the 1933 Birthday Honours. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Local politics Acland was elected to the North Canterbury Hospital Board in 1927 and remained a member for the following 17 years. He contested the election for Mayor of Christchurch in 1935 and was narrowly beaten by the incumbent, Labour's Dan Sullivan. The election attracted nationwide attention, as Christchurch was a Labour- stronghold and due to Acland's widespread popularity, it was regarded as a test whether Labour could potentially win the November 1935 general election (which it did).

A penalty shot is a type of penalty awarded when a team loses a clear scoring opportunity on a breakaway because of a foul committed by an opposing player. A player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender. However, when such a lost opportunity occurs and the opposing team has pulled its goalie to allow for an extra attacker, a goal is simply awarded without a penalty shot taking place.Rule 25 ‚Äì Awarded Goals, Official NHL rules In the Deutsche Eishockey Liga and National Hockey League, a goal can also be awarded if the goaltender deliberately knocks the goalpost off its moorings to stop a breakaway. A goal can also be automatically awarded during a penalty shot or a shootout, if the goaltender attempts to stop the attacker performing the penalty shot in an illegal manner. Background In ice hockey, a goal is scored when the puck completely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar. A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to (see also own goal). Typically, a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with his/her stick towards the goal net opening, and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against his/her team. A team may only have six players actively playing (\\"on the ice\\") at a time. A common tactic often employed by the trailing team toward the end of the game is to remove the goaltender (the \\"goalie\\") from the game in order to have all six players available for offense. This is called pulling the goalie. Under normal circumstances, a penalty shot is awarded to the player who lost the opportunity to score due to the penalty. Said player is given a one-on-one opportunity against the offending team's goaltender to score a goal. However, if the goaltender had been pulled, most ice hockey rule books automatically award the goal, assuming that if not for the penalty, the goal would have been scored.

By using a mouse or graphical pointer, a user can move a cursor over selected terms, and un-check or unclick specific choices, if the software permits it. A Checkbox is a graphical user interface element in which a computer user can make multiple selections from an array of options. If a computer user unclicks a radio button, then no options are selected. In this example, the item \\"Cat\\" is selected. Unclick is a term, increasingly applied in the context of computing, in which a computer user un-chooses or de-selects a specific preference, typically by moving a cursor over a selection, and pressing the left mouse button. As a result, the check mark image or dark circle inside a Checkbox or a Radio button is removed. While in January 2012 the term unclick is generally not formally defined in dictionaries, the term has been used in popular parlance in countries such as the United States, Britain, and Canada. Background As the Internet becomes an increasingly popular medium for marketers, vendors and marketers often presume that a user will prefer certain choices, such as receiving emails in the future, having specific computer settings, or preferring that specific programs will be operational when a computer is turned on. As a result, it is sometimes necessary for a user to unclick these choices to avoid exposure to unwanted advertising, or to avoid a situation in which a different website is chosen for one's home page. In Internet marketing, unclicking is often required for a user to avoid being billed automatically for unnecessary services, sometimes part of a deceptive business practice termed negative option billing. A user's Facebook privacy settings have often been chosen in advance by Facebook Inc., which presumes that a user would like particular settings, and to un-choose these options, a user may need to unclick or opt-out of the Facebook-determined choices by finding the right menus. According to behavioral economics, computer and Internet users have a general tendency to go along with a default setting. Other contexts The term unclick has also been used in other contexts, such as when there is a latching or locking mechanism, such as a lock on a briefcase, or seat belts in a car or airplane, or door lock, or other mechanisms which typically make a \\"clicking\\" sound. In these contexts, unclicking means to open the latch or seat belt. It has also been used in the context of guns, in which a safety catch is \\"unclicked\\", or flooring materials in which pieces are interlocked, The term has been used to describe the act of answering a cell phone by pressing on a button when it is ringing.

Since its main activity relied upon wet-leasing aircraft to other airlines, the company never operated services in its own right, but did so on other carriers' behalf; it also provided operating expertise and flight crews as required. Although Tempair was a UK- registered airline, it had neither an operation certificate nor a license from that country.

In , a Tempair Boeing 707-320 operated on behalf of Biman Bangladesh Airlines inaugurated the Dhaka‚ÄìLondon route for the recently created Bangladeshi flag carrier. In 1974, two Boeing 707-320s previously operated by T√ºrk Hava Yollari were acquired. Throughout its history, Tempair operated Boeing 720Bs, Boeing 707s (-320 and -320C series), and Vanguards. In , Tempair won a contract worth to fly pilgrims from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia and back, during the Hajj season, on behalf of Nigeria Airways. In December the same year the airline, competing with Qantas, Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett, won a contract for operating a Boeing 720B on Air Niugini's behalf, as well as for providing the cabin and flight staff, and the maintenance of the aircraft.

Continuing the epic story of Alexander the Great, The Sands of Ammon narrates of the Macedonian king's quest to conquer Asia. He and his men storm and conquer Persian towns and harbours; even the legendary town of Halicarnassus is defeated. Alexander's army marches on to the snow-covered Anatolia, where it records yet another few victories. Despite defeating the king Darius III, the city of Tyre and the Towers of Gaza prove to be formidable enemies, although they ultimately have to surrender to Alexander. The Macedonian army then heads south towards the mysterious and epic land of Egypt; and it's here, in the sands of the endless Libyan Desert, that the Oracle of Ammon lies. And what the divine Oracle will reveal to Alexander will change his life forever. Plot After the victory in Thessaly which ended the first book of the trilogy, Child of a Dream, Alexander and his army march towards the East. The first step of the expedition is to free the Greek cities from the Persian domination in order to establish a strong and united Pan- Hellenic League. Once that is achieved, the target is the Persian Empire itself and its immense Asian territory. During his military campaign the Macedonian army records numerous victories, including those against the city of Tyre, the Towers of Giza and the legendary Halicarnassus. And it is in the midst of this campaign that Alexander meets the only opponent he believes worthy of his utmost respect: Memnon of Rhodes, the commander of the Greek mercenaries of the Persian army. He struggles in the attempt to defeat Memnon fair and square on the field, but the two end up stalemating each other with strategic cunning. Alexander's friends then suggest to end the confrontation between the two men by ordering to poison the mercenary; Alexander is however disgusted by this outrageous idea as he reckons his opponent is worthy of being defeated with respect and the only way for that to be possible is for Alexander to beat him on the battle field. However, Alexander's friends do carry out the order without Alexander's approval or knowing and Memnon is poisoned within a few weeks. The mercenary's death represents an anti- climactic end to the fantastic strategic battle between the two. After Memnon's death, Alexander claims his former wife: the beautiful Barsine. The two grow close, which makes Leptine jealous of their relationship. After the Macedonian army finally defeats Darius, thank to a tactically perfect charge, Alexander becomes the sovereign of the greatest Empire that ever existed. Darius offers terms of unconditional surrender, but Alexander, realizing his position, rejects Darius's initial offer. Darius is thus forced to come back, offering all his territory as far as the Euphrates and a huge ransom. The surrounding nations, seeing Alexander's ruthlessness in victory, fear a similar defeat, and some of their leaders choose to abdicate power to Alexander rather than face him in battle. But the young king is certainly not satisfied: he heads towards Egypt and, after defeating the Tyrian naval force that was attempting to block his way into the country, he finally makes it to the land of the Pharaohs. Here, he is proclaimed Pharaoh and he founds the first of his cities: Alexandria. Finally, he crosses the Libyan Desert and after a long and hard journey, he reaches the Oasis of Siwa, where the Oracle of Ammon lies. This tells him that he is not a mere human, but the son of Zeus himself.

Gentrification of Atlanta's inner-city neighborhoods began in the 1970s, and it has continued, at varying levels of intensity, into the present. Many factors have contributed to the city's gentrification. A major increase in gentrification that occurred in the last years of the twentieth century has been attributed to the 1996 Summer Olympics. However, during the 2000s, Atlanta underwent a profound transformation demographically, physically, and culturally. Suburbanization, rising prices, a booming economy, and new migrants decreased the city‚Äôs black percentage from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010.U.S. Census Bureau From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the city‚Äôs black population decreased by 31,678. Much of the city‚Äôs demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding Downtown Atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%. Between the mid-1990s and 2010, stimulated by funding from the HOPE VI program, Atlanta demolished nearly all of its public housing, a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units in the city.US Census Bureau 1990 census - total number of housing units in Atlanta city In 2005, the $2.8 billion BeltLine project was adopted, with the stated goals of converting a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and increasing the city‚Äôs park space by 40%.Atlanta BeltLine Lastly, Atlanta‚Äôs cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the High Museum of Art doubled in size; the Alliance Theatre won a Tony Award; and numerous art galleries were established on the once-industrial Westside. There is also a national trend of young people moving back into the cities, and Atlanta is one of the cities experiencing that. Metro Atlanta is also one of the fastest growing areas in the country in terms of both population and job growth and expected to grow by another 3 million between now and 2040. That makes intown areas attractive for those working intown, and much land is still available in some neighborhoods.8 Cities With Surprising Job Growth Gentrification by area Cabbagetown Ponce City Market, being repurposed for mixed use in Old Fourth Ward Southeast Atlanta Many of Atlanta's neighborhoods experienced the urban flight that affected other major American cities in the 20th century, causing the decline of once upper and upper- middle-class southeast Atlanta neighborhoods including Grant Park, Inman Park, Candler Park, Peoplestown and SummerHill. In the 1970s, after neighborhood opposition blocked two freeways from being built through the Southeast side, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's gentrification wave, first becoming affordable, hip but edgy neighborhoods attracting young people, and by 2000 having become relatively affluent areas attracting people from across Metro Atlanta to their upscale shops and restaurants. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, gentrification expanded into other parts of Atlanta, [ https://atlantafi.com/atlanta-gentrified-neighborhoods/ \\"Atlanta's gentrified neighborhoods\\", Atlantafi.com, 2019] spreading throughout the historic streetcar suburbs east of Downtown and Midtown, areas with black majorities historically such as the Old Fourth Ward, Kirkwood, Reynoldstown and Edgewood as well as Cabbagetown, once populated mostly by working-class whites with Appalachian origins. On the western side of the city, condos, apartments, and retail space were built into former warehouse spaces, transforming once- industrial West Midtown into a vibrant neighborhood full of residential lofts and a nexus of the arts, restaurants, and home furnishings. . The \\"poster child\\" for gentrification in Atlanta today is the Old Fourth Ward. Gentrification of the Ward began in the 1980s, and continued at a more rapid pace during the first decade of the 2000s. New apartment and condo complexes with ground-floor retail sprung up, particularly along the BeltLine, Ponce de Leon Avenue, North Avenue, and Highland Avenue. New residents were attracted to the neighborhood due to its close proximity to Downtown, Midtown, Inman Park, and Virginia-Highland, its urban vibe, its walkability, and its cultural offerings. By the 2010s, Old Fourth Ward had become one of the most dynamic and sought-after areas of the city, winning Creative Loafing's 2010 award for \\"Best Bet for Next Hot 'Hood\\". The area, which remains majority black, has seen a huge influx of whites in recent decades. The trend began in the 1980s, and from 1980 to 2000, the area west of Boulevard went from 12% to 30% white and the area east of Boulevard went from 2% to 20% white. In 2010, Creative Loafing awarded Old Fourth Ward \\"Best Bet for Next Hot 'Hood.\\"\\"Best Bet For Next Hot 'Hood: Old Fourth Ward\\", Creative Loafing, 2010 In 2011, the neighborhood celebrated the opening of the Historic Fourth Ward Park and saw the kickoff of the Ponce City Market project. Northwest Atlanta The far Northwest Atlanta is experiencing major pressure from neighboring Cobb County, Buckhead and Cascade Heights, to invest more into the gentrification of the following neighborhoods Riverside, Bolton, and Whittier Mill Village. The inner parts of Northwest Atlanta such as Knight Park, Berkeley Park and Howell Mill are almost completely gentrified, whereas Bankhead, Rockdale and other neighborhoods in the Northwest have begun gentrification. Southwest Atlanta Southwest Atlanta is the area between I-75 and I-20 along with the neighborhoods West of Grant Park. West End is the fastest gentrifying in the Southwest, with both the affluent Cascade Heights district and downtown putting pressure on this area. Southwest neighborhoods gentrifying include: West End, Capitol View, Capitol View Manor, Mechanicsville, Pittsburgh, Westview, Oakland City and Adair Park. The gentrification in the Southwest differs from other parts of Atlanta in that it is largely wealthier black professionals and families moving in. These neighborhoods had been majority- black either since white flight in the 1940s-1960s. They fell into steady decline, with Stewart Avenue becoming infamous for prostitution, crime and drugs. But by 2000, in Adair Park, young people were starting to move back into the neighborhood, settling alongside many lifelong residents, attracted by the \\"charming affordable bungalows and community spirit\\".\\"Adair Park: Newcomers rediscover the charms of this southwest hood\\", Creative Loafing, October 7, 2000 Unlike gentrification waves in northeastern and eastern Atlanta, the one in inner southwestern neighborhoods consisted overwhelmingly of African Americans, and the area (NPU V) remained 89% black as of the 2010 census. South Atlanta South Atlanta is the part of Atlanta typically Southeast of I-75 and West of Moreland Avenue, South of Grant Park, including McDonough Blvd. Neighborhoods include: South Atlanta, Lakewood Heights, and High Point. These neighborhoods are showing early signs of gentrification with South Atlanta being the farthest along with some already unaffordable exclusive neighborhoods built along McDonough Blvd. Condemnation Nathan McCall in his novel Them, describes the concerns of existing working-class black residents in the Old Fourth Ward in light of increasing numbers of more affluent white families moving into their historically black neighborhood.\\"Them\\", Amazon.com The Atlanta Progressive News regularly runs stories expressing concerns about the displacement of existing residents and the lack of \\"affordable\\" housing as a result of gentrification.Atlanta Progressive News: search for term \\"gentrification\\" The gentrification of the city‚Äôs neighborhoods has been the topic of social commentary, including The Atlanta Way, a documentary detailing the negative effects gentrification has had on the city and its inhabitants. Displacement of existing residents Factors It is difficult to isolate one factor of gentrification, since they often feed others. A Georgia State student studied gentrification in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Atlanta (between Adair Park and Peoplestown) and came up with the following causes of displacement generally lead to gentrification. Some additional information is available from the Annie E Casey foundation, again on Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is a good neighborhood for studying gentrification because like much of NPU-V, it is ground zero for what is expected to be the next wave with planners and researchers working hard to make sure displacement is not so rampant as in other parts of Atlanta.Stakeholders' Perspective of Risk of Gentrification in Atlanta's Pittsburgh NeighborhoodPittsburgh Preservation * Increased costs to live in neighborhood. ** Higher rents. ** Increasing land values. ** Higher taxes. ** Investor flipping * Decreased affordable housing inventory ** Increasing numbers of vacant properties. ** Redevelopment of affordable housing stock with less affordable and infill development. ** Condemnation * Uneven access to capital. * Political displacement: Existing residents losing stake in clubs and organizations, causing some to move out. Remediation of displacement With the understanding that gentrification is a likely inevitable force for the beltline area: the Anne E. Casey Foundation along with land banks, churches, community leaders, and other organizations are working to ensure that neighborhoods in the Southwest do not experience the same level of community displacement as in the Eastern parts of Atlanta. This involves efforts such as acquiring vacant homes to revitalize them and move in stable working-class citizens with restrictions on future sale price, workforce training, tax stabilization, and education on property values to avoid homeowners selling to flippers.

It lies above the Salzhemmendorf village of Lauenstein in the German state of Lower Saxony. The castle was built in the 13th century by the barons of Homburg. From the 16th century it became militarily insignificant and was demolished in the 19th century due to its increasing state of dilapidation.  Location  The ruins of Lauenstein castle are located on the edge of Ith ridge on a hill summit above the village of Lauenstein. The castle terrain is covered by thick forest that was planted in the 19th century when the hill was reutilised.  Site  The roughly 50 x 50 metre castle plateau lies on an eminence that is surrounded by steep hillsides. It is protected on all sides by a wide moat. The direct access to the castle was built in the form of a zwinger in front of the gateway whose walls are still 4 metres high today. Parts of the enceinte of the castle still exists. There is an information board at the entrance to the castle site, although there is a risk of collapse or falling due to the state of the ruined walls and the steep hillsides.

In 1247 Heinrich von Homburg transferred the castle to the Welf duke, Otto the Child. At the same time he received it back as a fief. Thereafter inhabitants of abandoned villages settled in the surrounding area under the protection of the castle and founded the village of Lauenstein, first mentioned in 1430. The Homburg Amt of Lauenstein had its seat in the castle. In 1359 it encompassed 40 villages in the region between the Ith and Hils ridges and the Leine river. When the male line of the Homburgs died out in 1409 the castle and all its chattels were transferred to the Welf dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. As a result of financial difficulties, they enfeoffed the castle in 1433 to Bishop Magnus of the Bishopric of Hildesheim, who sublet it to: *1434 The von Cramm brothers *1445 Ludolf von Ruscheplate *1456 The B√∂cke brothers of Nordholz *1495 Bartold von Oberg and the knightly brothers of the Rutenberge *1497 Heinrich von Saldern *1515 Burchard von Saldern Lauenstein and castle hill in 1654 When in 1515 Burchard von Saldern and his two brothers took over the castle and Amt of Lauenstein from their father, Heinrich, the Hildesheim bishop terminated the contract. The brothers refused to give up the castle and Amt. In addition, they demanded 3,000 guilders, to repay what they had invested in fortifications. After lengthy negotiations an arbitral decision was reached in 1518. The bishop was to pay the von Salderns the construction costs, but the von Salderns had to leave the castle and Amt of Lauenstein. Because Burchard refused to accept the money offered, he was driven from Lauenstein Castle in 1518. In his place, Stacius von M√ºnchhausen was appointed as the Hildesheim advocate at the castle. After a failed attack on the castle, Burchard von Saldern burned Lauenstein down in revenge and nailed a notice of feud to the castle gate with the words: \\"Borchert von Salder do bekand; dat ick hebbe jedan du√üen Brand; dat bekenne ick mit meiner Hand.\\" (\\"Burchard von Saldern makes known that I lit this fire; I confess this with my own hand\\"). This action fuelled the fighting during the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud. The dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg captured the castle back in 1521 and reinstated Burchard von Saldern to the Amt. However, his son, Heinrich, fell out with the dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in 1587 and was forced out. After that the castle was managed by bailiffs (Amtm√§nnern). In 1635, during the Thirty Years' War, the village of Lauenstein was invaded by imperial troops under Tilly and suffered much damage. They remained as occupation troops for four years. In 1637 Swedish troops followed. In 1640 Lauenstein fell victim to soldiers from Weimar, who plundered the place. In 1806 the village was used as billets for Napoleonic troops. The castle had had no military significances since the Thirty Years' War and had fallen into disrepair. When Lauenstein was completely razed in 1730 by a house fire, stone from the castle was used to rebuild it. The terrain of the outer ward, known as the Knabenburg, was bought in 1737 by the Amtmann, Niemeyer, who farmed it until 1850. At the beginning of the 19th century the last remnants of the castle were demolished and the castle well filled in. In the mid-19th century a small observation tower was built on the highest point of the castle hill - it has since fallen into disrepair. A chapel-like building was also built on the hilltop.

The technique was used in a variety of ways in Italy during the Renaissance. The term is mostly found in English applied to gilded work on picture frames or small pieces of furniture such as wooden caskets and cassoni, and also on areas of panel paintings,National Gallery glossary; the term is sometimes italicized in English, and sometimes not, though in \\"white lead pastiglia\\" more often not. but there is some divergence as to the meaning of the term between these specialisms. On frames and furniture the technique is in origin a cheaper imitation of woodcarving, metalwork or ivory carving techniques. Within paintings, the technique gives areas with a three-dimensional effect, usually those representing inanimate objects, such as foliage decoration on architectural surrounds, halos and details of dress, rather than parts of figures. In white lead pastiglia on caskets, the subject matter is usually classical, with a special emphasis on stories from Ancient Roman history. White lead pastiglia In reference to work on picture frames and paintings moulded and gilded gesso is still commonly described as pastiglia,For example: Cohen, 183, here and by the National Gallery but in recent decades writers on furniture and the decorative arts tend to distinguish between this and \\"true\\" pastiglia, or white lead pastigliaDe Winter and Manni led the new distinction. Campbell's contributors for \\"Cassone\\" and \\"Pastiglia\\" use different definitions, the latter saying (p.194) \\"Cassone\\" decoration, described from the late 19th century onwards as pastiglia, is in fact gilt gesso. Pastiglia would be too small and fragile for a large cassone\\". which is defined as being made from white lead powder, made by combining powdered lead and vinegar in an anaerobic environment, bound with egg white. White lead bound with oil or egg yolk was also the most common pigment for white paint. White lead pastiglia is very delicate and used for small areas only, but can produce very fine detail. It was mainly used on small caskets and boxes. Sections were typically pre- moulded, doubtless from metal matrices to judge from the crisp detail,John Fleming and Hugh Honour, Dictionary of the Decorative Arts, s.v. \\"Pastiglia\\". and glued on when hard. This was usually left unpainted, when it looked like carved ivory, which had been widely used to decorate boxes in Italy, by the Embriachi and others, but was by now less used, partly because it was too rare and expensive. The wood from which the main box was made was normally alder. It seems the term pastiglia for this only dates to the 17th century, after the technique had largely fallen from use. A scented variant called pasta di muschio (\\"musk paste\\") mixed musk perfume with the white lead, and was thought to be \\"aphrodisiacal\\", and so used for caskets given at a marriage,Metropolitan Museum casket; they seem to say the casket is made with both gesso and white lead paste. and also other objects such as inkwells and frames for hand mirrors.Thornton, 109 White lead pastiglia was a north Italian speciality, produced between about 1450 and 1550. Six workshops were identified by Patrick M. De Winter, although their location remains uncertain; the Workshop of the Love and Moral Themes, whose products seem the most numerous, was possibly at Ferrara,Campbell, 194, citing Manni where the painter Cosimo Tura began his career gilding caskets.Thornton, 109 Venice is also thought to have produced them. Other workshops identified by De Winter include the \\"Workshop of the main Berlin casket\\" and \\"Workshop of the Cleveland Casket\\".Sotheby's; the Cleveland Casket The subjects were typically classical, drawn from both mythology and Ancient Roman history (especially the early period covered by Livy), but biblical ones are also found. Compositions can often be shown to be borrowed from another medium, such as prints or bronze plaquettes,Bull, 39; see for example the British Museum page on their box illustrated here, where one element is copied from a bronze; Campbell, 194 and sections from the same mould can be found repeated, and used on more than one piece. The Victoria and Albert Museum has an armorial casket which is the only example that can be fairly closely dated, using the career of its owner, Cardinal Bernardo Clesio, as it must date to between his elevation as cardinal in 1530 and his resignation as Prince-bishop of Trent in 1538.V&A; Museum De Winter catalogued 115 white lead pastiglia caskets, only ten of which were over 20 cm high or deep. Another of this relatively large type was sold at auction in 2010.Sotheby's London, 7 December 2010, Sale L10233, Lot 31, sold for ¬£163,250 inc. premium, Sale catalogue online. This price was exceptional; compare this lot at Christie's in 2006 Despite usually having locks, their thin alderwood frame meant that the caskets were probably too fragile to be used for really valuable items like jewellery, and they are thought to have been used for a variety of small objects including cosmetics and collections of seals, coins and the like. In 2002, the Lowe Art Museum in Coral Gables, Miami held an exhibition of Pastiglia Boxes: Hidden Treasures of the Italian Renaissance from the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'arte antica in Rome, and an 80-page exhibition catalogue was published in English and Italian.See further reading Gesso pastiglia Gesso pastiglia is mostly found in Italy in the 14th to 16th centuries, where pastiglia on larger pieces of furniture such as cassoni, and on picture frames, was more likely to be gilded gesso than true white lead pastiglia. Both panel paintings and gilded frames had a thin flat layer of gesso as part of their preparation, to which the pastiglia decoration was added. On furniture and frames the gesso seems sometimes to have been carved from a thicker flat surface in a subtractive technique, and sometimes built up in an additive one, for smaller and larger areas respectively. Another additive technique was to simple pipe the gesso from a bag through a nozzle, like icing a cake, to give long round lines, often used as the tendrills in foliage designs.Penny, Nicholas, A Closer Look: Frames, 80, 2011, Yale University Press, , ; Penny avoids the term \\"pastiglia\\" in discussing picture frames, talking of piped and \\"press-cast\\" gesso. It was then always gilded or painted, usually the former. The technique was very widely used in painted panels while gold-ground paintings remained the norm for altarpieces, along with a range of other techniques for decorating plain gilded surfaces such as stamping, engraving or scratching lines, and stippling, punching or pricking dots. In Gothic architectural frames for polyptychs, pastiglia is very commonly used to decorate small flat areas such as spandrels and behind scalloped edges. The technique is described at the end of the technical handbook by Cennino Cennini, whose own paintings made use of it, although he does not use the term himself.von Imhoff, 142 Madonna of the Quail by Pisanello With the decline of the gold-ground style it became rarer within paintings, as opposed to frames, but was sometimes used for highlights, or a particular purpose. A famous portrait by Sandro Botticelli, who trained as a goldsmith, Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder (Uffizi, c. 1474), has the medal the subject is holding executed in gilded pastiglia, which apparently is an impression moulded from the original matrix for the metal medals, some of which survive.Cohen, 113. The medal is not reversed, so was either from the matrix, or made by using a new matrix cast from a medal. Pisanello frequently used the technique; his The Vision of Saint Eustace (National Gallery, probably about 1540) shows a very fancily dressed courtier on a horse, and has pastiglia highlights on medallions on the horse harness, and the gold mounts on his hunting horn and his spurs, all gilded and representing pieces of goldsmith work.Syson and Gordon, 158 Such highlights are seen on other paintings by Pisanello, who was the leading medalist of his day, and familiar with modelling and casting techniques. Similar pastiglia medallions on horse-harness are found in the fresco Saint George and the Princess (Verona), and the Apparition of the Virgin to Saints Anthony Abbot and George (National Gallery).Syson and Gordon, 22 & 140 In his gold-ground Madonna of the Quail (Verona, attributed), the pastiglia is on the halos and borders of the Virgin's dress at neck and cuff, her crown, and in foliage decoration to the gold \\"sky\\", all typical locations in earlier religious paintings. A generation after Pisanello, the conservative Carlo Crivelli continued to use pastiglia highlights in his panels,Cohen, 113 and it is used in Vincenzo Foppa's Adoration of the Kings (National Gallery) at the end of the century, in the crowns and gifts of the Three Kings.Dunkerton and Plazzotta The technique is rarer in fresco, but there are extensive areas of patterns in the cycle of the life of Queen Theodelinda in Monza Cathedral by the Zavattari family around 1440, no doubt using normal fresco plaster.Syson and Gordon, 58, discusses and illustrates the cycle, without mentioning the pastiglia; Monza Duomo museum It was perhaps more common in decorating secular palaces than churches, but the vast majority of Gothic palace decorations are now lost. In England, it was used in the Painted Chamber of Westminster Palace as well as the much-damaged Westminster Retable painted panel,V≈°eteƒçkov√° and in Early Netherlandish painting used in works such as the Seilern Triptych attributed to Robert Campin, where the gold skies have elaborate patterns of foliage, with a different design on each panel.Courtauld, The Seilern Triptych By about 1500, and with the advent of painting on more flexible canvas, which would not be a suitable support for pastiglia, use in painting disappears, but it continued on picture frames, where Renaissance gesso pastiglia generally consisted of vegetal motifs.Example in the Victoria & Albert Museum During the 16th century cassoni and some frames became more massive, and woodcarving replaced pastiglia.Osborne, 125-126 Cassoni Florentine cassone with gilded pastiglia panel, 15th century Gesso pastiglia was very widely used on cassoni from the inception of the form in the 14th century. Early decoration tended to be repeated motifs derived from textile designs. Early cassoni were mostly either entirely painted or entirely decorated in gilded pastiglia, but by the 15th century painted panels were inset in elaborate pastiglia surrounds of mouldings - many of the paintings have now been detached and hang in museums. The subjects used for decorating cassoni in either medium had considerable overlap with those on white lead pastiglia caskets, with a heavy bias towards mythology. The paintings were typically by specialized workshops, of less quality than the leading local masters, but in the 15th century, many important painters sometimes produced them. Vasari complained that by his day artists looked down on this work, and by then more massive and elaborately carved walnut cassoni were in fashion.Campbell, 205-207; Bull, 38-39; Osborne, 125-126 The Victoria and Albert Museum has a Florentine example of a class of \\"coffrets\\" intermediate between caskets and cassoni, which is known by the motto Onesta e bella on its top, and would have been an engagement present from the future husband to his bride, formally presented to her by a representative from his family at her house, filled with small presents from the bridegroom's family. Smaller white lead pastiglia caskets were probably also used on such occasions.Ajmar-Wollheim, Marta; Dennis, Flora, At home in Renaissance Italy, 127, 2006, Victoria and Albert Museum, , Made in about 1400, it is only 23 cm high and 61.5 cm wide and decorated with gilded pastiglia scenes made from gesso dura of courtly hunting and jousting on a painted blue field; these were apparently hand-modelled, not cast.V&A; Coffret \\"onesta e bella\\" Plaquettes in bookbinding Although the term pastiglia is not typically used to describe them, it is appropriate to mention \\"plaquette\\" bookbindings here. These are luxury leather bindings which incorporate, normally at the centre of the front cover, small inset plaquettes or roundels with designs in relief, which may be painted in colour. They appear towards the end of the 15th century, probably in Florence or Padua,Diehl, 83 says Florence; Hobson, 13 says Padua and were at first used for special presentation volumes. Initially the designs were taken from antique carved gems. It was the famous, and rich, French bibliophile Jean Grolier who was apparently the first to use them systematically for his own books, while he was based in Milan as Treasurer for the French occupation; probably he began to commission them in 1510. He was also the first to use original designs, several of which showed scenes from Livy; altogether 25 Italian plaquette bindings for Grolier survive.Hobson, 13-21 Some just use stamped leather, but for others the material used is variously described as \\"a sort of gesso mixed with varnish\\",Diehl, 83 or just \\"gesso\\",Marks, 40 but these plaquettes can have extremely fine detail. What may have been Grolier's first such binding has a plaquette with 11 human figures and an architectural setting in a scene about two inches (50 mm) wide, showing Marcus Curtius leaping into the hole, the same subject as on the British Museum casket illustrated at the start of the article.BL G 9026, De Medicina, by Aulus Cornelius Celsus; British Library Bindings database, with good images.

The developers modeled Stablewood after North and South Boulevard in Boulevard Oaks. Stablewood was one of the first subdivisions to be built in central Houston since the 1960s, and the first subdivision established in the Tanglewood area in a span of over 20 years. Stablewood was scheduled to include 135 houses ranging upwards from $375,000 in 1989 dollars. In the 1990s the developers transferred maintenance and management responsibilities to the Property Owners Association. Cityscape The community includes 135 lots for houses. They were originally scheduled to be priced at $375,000 and higher in 1989 dollars, with prices at around $30 per foot in 1989 dollars. The community was to have six oversized lots. The largest lot, which has of land, was to have a $2 million in 1989 dollars price. The community includes eight streets. All of them are privately owned. A guardhouse, located on Memorial Drive, controls access into the community. Residents may use key cards to enter and exit through the other main entrance, on Post Oak Boulevard. Houses in Stablewood are required to have more than of space. When the houses were built, they were to have a minimum price of $800,000. As of 2011 the community includes 121 houses.

His influence on historical developments on Europe has been the subject a numerous assessments. Some of the subjects that has been assessed are Metternich's over-all diplomatic skills and actual degree of influence, his role in shaping the balance of power in Europe, and his opposition to nationalist and liberal movements. Historians agree on Metternich's skill as a diplomat and his dedication to conservatism. According to Arthur May, he believed that: : the mass of Europeans yearned for security, quiet, and peace, and regarded liberal abstractions as repugnant or were utterly indifferent to them. The best of all patterns of government, he insisted, was autocratic absolutism, upheld by a loyal army, by a submissive, decently efficient bureaucracy and police machine, and by trustworthy churchmen. Arthur J. May, The Age of Metternich: 1814-1848 (2nd ed 1963), pp 3-4. Historiography For over two centuries, historians have disagreed on Metternich. Professor Enno Kraehe assembled excerpts from 17 experts, and tagged each one:Enno Kraehe, ed., The Metternich Controversy (1971), p. iii.online * \\"Traitor to France\\" * \\"Wise Appeaser of France\\" * \\"Unwise Appeaser of France\\" * \\"Statesman of Philosophical Principles\\" * \\"Vain Neurotic\\" * \\"Responsible Statesman of International Order\\" * \\"Short-range Opportunist\\" * \\"Reactionary Exploiter of Germany\\" * \\"Honest Leader Against Revolution\\" * \\"Bulwark against Potential Fascism * \\"Winner in the Diplomatic Contest for Germany\\" * \\"Perceptive But Superficial Tinkerer\\" * \\"Enlightened But Thwarted Reformer\\" * \\"The Destructive Demon of Austria\\" * \\"Statesman in Tragic Impasse\\" * \\"Metternich Guilty\\" * \\"Metternich Not Guilty\\" Criticism Particularly in the 19th century, Metternich was heavily criticised as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from \\"developing along 'normal' liberal and constitutional lines\\". If Metternich had not stood in the way of (in their view) progress, Austria might have reformed, dealt with the problems of nationality better, and the First World War may never have happened. Instead, Metternich fought bitterly against the forces of liberalism and nationalism, but achieved only a temporary reprieve. Indeed, Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, suggests that the social conservatism Metternich advocated may have actually been counter-productive when it came to keeping a lid on nationalist sentiment Moreover, in pursuit of this unachievable goal, Metternich was happy to sacrifice freedom of speech: heavy censorship was just one of many repressive instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network. Though he did not introduce the bodies, he gave them their \\"demoralising aspect of permanence\\" during his long tenure as chancellor. He also opposed electoral reform, heavily criticising the British Reform Bill introduced in 1830. A more enlightened chancellor would have realised he was involved in a battle with \\"the prevailing mood of his age\\". Instead of his zero tolerance approach, critics maintain that would have done better to have turned the current in a favourable direction; for example, the Austrian historian Viktor Bibl described Metternich as \\"the demon of Austria\\" for letting Prussia and not Austria unify Germany through his determination that Germany should not unify at all. Likewise, Metternich has been accused of excessive vanity to the point of complacency, and therefore someone ill-suited to the evolution of constitutional principles. This view presupposes that Metternich had the ability to favourably shape Europe, but chose not to. More modern critiques, such as that included in the work of A. J. P. Taylor, have questioned just how much influence Metternich really had. Okey noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich \\"had only his own persuasiveness to rely on\\", and this degraded over time. On this reading, he stuck doggedly to a set of \\"cumbersome\\" conservative principles that he was forced to articulate in long and detailed memoranda: a \\"smokescreen\\" that hid Austria's true weakness. When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, \\"most men could do better while shaving\\". The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomatic force: Taylor described him as \\"the most boring man in European history\\"; Metternich himself boasted he could \\"bore men to death\\". This view also highlights Metternich's abject failure to live up to his hype as the \\"coachman of Europe\\": Austria did not defeat Napoleon; Austria did not dictate the peace of Vienna; Austria could not stop France invading Spain, Britain settling the borders of Belgium or Russia deciding the fate of Turkey in 1833. Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to push through even his own proposals for administrative reform. On this basis it is argued that Metternich was essentially irrelevant both home and abroad. Support On the other hand, Metternich's credentials as a diplomat and statesman were the focus of praise in the twentieth century from more favourable historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after the Second World War, historians were more likely to defend Metternich's policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his own goals i.e. the defence of the balance of power in Europe and the preservation of the status quo in the face of the revolutionary challenge. Even if the sort of international conspiracy Metternich imagined never existed, the Napoleonic era was a time of change which left a conservative like Metternich with few options. More sympathetic historians highlight that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. If there was a partition in Europe between conservatives and liberals, they contend that some blame must lie with the liberals such as Canning and Palmerston for their failure to compromise as Lord Castlereagh had in 1815. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure 30 years of peace, the \\"Age of Metternich\\". In the works of authors such as Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas, Metternich also gains credit for many of his more liberal ideals, even if they did not come to much; indeed, Metternich's lack of influence at court is now used to shield him from the harshest criticisms of inactivity. They argue that Metternich commendably pushed for an embryonic parliament and equal rights for the constituent states of the Empire at home, and abroad argued for equality before the law, modern bureaucracies, and fair levels of taxation. In 1847, Metternich himself denied that the Austrian Empire was anything but liberal. In this light, Metternich's methods have been seen as paternalistic, protecting Austrians from real dangers outside their borders. Those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich likewise contend that, along with contemporaries Viscount Castlereagh and Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, Metternich \\"unquestionably [a] master of diplomacy\\", someone who \\"perfected\\" and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era. For them, Metternich was \\"handsome, witty... [and] tenacious\\", by his own admission \\"bad at skirmishes... but good at campaigns\\". Likewise, Henry Kissinger's PhD dissertation about Metternich, later published in 1957, praised Metternich's role in holding together the crumbling Austrian Empire, though Kissinger's work has generated controversy in academic circles among such historians as Paul W. Schroeder, inter alia attracting criticism for the absence of footnotes. Certainly, if he was a good diplomat he certainly attracted a great deal of contemporary criticism for lying; fellow diplomats Canning and Talleyrand both commented on it, whilst the poet Franz Grillparzer suggested that Metternich came to believe his own lies. Even so, as critical historian Alan Sked argues, Metternich's \\"smokescreen\\" served a purpose in furthering a relative coherent set of principles, though it came at the expense of being in control of individual events. However, Sked is quick to also point out that Metternich's apparent liberalism, as put forward by Viereck and Haas, did not amount to wanting decentralisation, and as such the old concerns that Metternich pushed for a (now outmoded) heavily centralised autocratic system cannot be dismissed. Sked does, however, warn against the use of hindsight, arguing that Metternich's actions were, at the time, entirely in keeping with Austrian politics, and that the events of 1848 were a mere blip when Austria lost its nerve. Julius Evola, described as \\"one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history\\", author of Revolt Against the Modern World, saw Metternich as a conservative ideal.

Based in Charlottesville, Va., the institute ‚Äúbrings science and contemplative wisdom together to better understand the mind and create positive change in the world,\\" focusing on individual well-being, societal flourishing, and interconnection. Over three decades, Mind & Life has played a key role in the mindfulness meditation movement by funding research projects and think tanks, and by convening academic conferences and dialogues with the Dalai Lama. Origins: dialogues and publications alt= alt= alt= Mind and Life Dialogues, forerunners of the Institute, were initiated by American entrepreneur R. Adam Engle in 1983.Begley 2007, pp.19-22 He heard of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama‚Äôs interest in modern science and offered to arrange a dialogue for him with selected scientists. The Dalai Lama accepted and authorised Engle to set one up.Begley 2007, pp.19-20 In 1984 Chilean neuroscientist Francisco Varela heard about this. Having participated in a conference on consciousness attended by the Dalai Lama in 1983,Begley 2007, pp.18-19 and like Engle a Buddhist practitioner since 1974, he was interested in further exploration of the interface between science and Buddhism and contacted Engle, offering to assist. Engle, Varela, and the Dalai Lama saw Buddhism and science as different methodologies with a similar aim: to investigate nature and reality, using knowledge gained to improve the quality of life and the planet. They concurred that science uses technology and the scientific method as its means while Buddhism uses the human nervous system refined by meditation and rigorous mental and emotional training. Until then, there had been no mechanism for scientists and Buddhist masters to meet and share their findings in dialogue. The concept pioneered a new interdisciplinary, cross-cultural engagement.Watson 2008, p.169 Engle organized the original Mind and Life Dialogue in October 1987 at the Dalai Lama‚Äôs residence in Dharamshala, India as a week-long event.Hayward, Varela 1992, Preface Six scientists including Varela, two interpreters and the Dalai Lama spent five hours daily, sharing views and discussing the sciences of the mind. At the end, Engle asked the Dalai Lama if he wanted to do it again. The answer was \\"yes,\\" and the series of dialogues was born. The second dialogue was a two-day event in October 1989 in Newport Beach, California. At the third dialogue, held in Dharamsala in 1990, it was decided that in order to organize and fund further dialogues and potential research programmes the Mind and Life Institute should be incorporated as a non-profit organization in the USA.Begley 2007, p.258Watson 2008, p.170 The institute was incorporated in 1991. Engle was elected Chair and CEO, a post he held for 22 years until his retirement in 2012 having guided its development into \\"a worldwide and influential organization bringing together the highest standards of modern science and contemplative practice.\\" Engle was then succeeded by the physicist and author Arthur Zajonc. By 1998 Mind & Life had hosted seven dialogues between numerous world renowned scientists, philosophers and the Dalai Lama on cognitive neuroscience and physics, and published six books relating the dialogues to the general public. In 2005, Mind & Life held its second public dialogue in Washington DC, titled ‚ÄúThe Science and Clinical Applications of Meditation,‚Äù co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins Medical University, and the Georgetown Medical Center. By 2013 a total of 27 dialogues with the Dalai Lama had been hosted, eleven books had been published relating the first thirteen dialogues to the public (see publications) and DVDs or videos published on most of the others. In 2016, under the new leadership of president Susan Bauer-Wu, PhD, the Mind and Life Institute relocated to Charlottesville, Virginia. By 2019, 33 Dialogues with the Dalai Lama had been hosted. The format then shifted to shorter, more frequent conversations between leading thinkers and spiritual leaders such as the Dalai Lama on critical issues of modern life at the intersection of scientific and contemplative understanding. Establishment of research agenda In 1998, to increase Mind & Life's potential for societal benefits, Engle broadened its mission to include carrying out scientific research. This idea was encouraged by the Dalai Lama, who, at the next dialogue in 2000, suggested scientific investigation under laboratory conditions to establish whether Buddhist contemplative practices could be of significant benefit to modern society, and if so to find a way of teaching the subject in a secular environment. A research programme was launched accordingly as a result of Mind & Life's first public dialogue, held at MIT in 2003, entitled \\"Investigating the Mind.\\" Participants included Nobel Laureate scientist Daniel Kahneman and Eric Lander, Director of the MIT Centre for Genomic Research. This conference was attended by 1,200 people and marked the birth of contemplative neuroscience. In 2004, Mind & Life launched its Summer Research Institute at the Garrison Institute in New York. This conference presented the first curriculum on contemplative neuroscience to graduate students, post doctorates and science faculty members.Begley, 2007 p.260 In the same year, Mind & Life started the Francisco J. Varela Research Awards, which provided pilot study funding to qualified applicants on a competitive basis. Through this and other grant mechanisms, by 2019, Mind & Life had awarded more than $5.2 million to over 270 projects in cognitive science, psychology, medicine, anthropology, religious studies, and education‚Äîin 30 US states and 20 countries. In 2012 Mind & Life hosted its inaugural International Symposium on Contemplative Studies (ISCS) in Denver Colorado, with 700 attendees from the field of Contemplative Science and Studies research. In 2014, ISCS was held in Boston with 1,700 attendees from 28 countries. In 2016 ISCS took place in San Diego, California, with 1,200 attendees from 34 countries.

He was shortly followed by Mar Abraham; both reached in Malabar after the arrival of the Portuguese.Abdisho IV Maron(1555‚Äì1570), the successor of Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa(Alias Mar John Sulaqa murdered in 1555), sent the brother of John, Mar Joseph, to Malabar as a Chaldaean bishop; although consecrated in 1555 or 1556, Mar Joseph could not reach India before the end of 1556, nor Malabar before 1558, when the Portuguese were finally alerted by the presence of Mar Abraham and allowed Mar Joseph, accompanied by another Chaldaean bishop, Mar Eliah, to ‚Äì very briefly ‚Äì occupy his see, before the Inquisition also sent him to Lisbon in 1562. Introduction The last two Assyrian bishops of Malabar were Joseph Sulaqa and Mar Abraham; both arrived in Malabar after the arrival of the Portuguese.Encyclopaedia of sects & religious doctrines, Volume 4 By Charles George Herbermann page 1180,1181 There is no doubt that Joseph Sulaqa's appointment was canonical, for he, the brother of the first Chaldean patriarch Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa, was appointed by his successor Abdisho IV Maron and sent out to Malabar. Before that he was the bishop of Nineveh (Joseph was consecrated Metropolitan by his own brother Patriarch John Sulaqa in 1554 AD)A general history and collection of voyages and travels, arranged in systematic order By Robert Kerr,Page 478). Joseph was sent to India with letters of introduction from the pope to the Portuguese authorities; he was besides accompanied by Bishop Ambrose, a Dominican and papal commissary to the first patriarch, by his socius Father Anthony, and by Mar Elias Hormaz, Archbishop of Diarbekir. They arrived at Goa about 1563, and were detained at Goa for eighteen months before being allowed to enter the diocese. Proceeding to Cochin they lost Bishop Ambrose; the others travelled through Malabar for two and a half years on foot, visiting every church and detached settlement. By the time they arrived at Angamale war broke out. Then Mar Elias, Anthony the socius of the deceased prelate, and one of the two Syrian monks who had accompanied them, left India to return; the other monk remained with Archbishop Joseph Sulaka. For some time the new prelate got on well with the Portuguese and Jesuit missionaries, in fact, they praised him for having introduced order, decorum, and propriety in the Church services and all went harmoniously for some time. Later, friction arose because of his hindering the locally-ordained Syrians from saying mass and preaching and instructing his flock. Eventually an incident revealed that Mar Joseph had not dropped his allegiance to the Church of the East, for it was reported to the Bishop of Cochin that he had attempted to tamper with the faith of some young boys in his service belonging to the Diocese of Cochin. This came to the knowledge of the bishop, through him to the Metropolitan of Goa, then to the viceroy; it was decided to remove and send him to Portugal, to be dealt with by the Holy See. Accusing Mar Joseph for propagating \\"Nestorian error\\" they sent him to Portugal; arriving there he succeeded in securing the good will of the Queen, he expressed repentance, and by order of the queen was sent back to his diocese. Later years and death By 1567, Latin authorities asked him to make inquiries into the conduct and doctrine of the prelate suspected again for propagating Nestorian error; in consequence of this the first provincial council was held and finally, Mar Joseph, who was forced to leave India in 1568 died in Rome in 1569, where his brother Sulaqa was consecrated as patriarch 16 years earlier. His tomb has not been located so far. Eugene Tisserant (Roman Catholic Cardinal) in his book Eastern Christianity in India comments on the pathetic end of Mar Joseph Sulaqa. Cardinal comments.

With the rising Vietnamese comics industry in 2010s, Vietnamese animation is hoped to rise soon and catch up Thailand. Since 2016, animation in Vietnam has seen a significant improvement in 3D animation techniques, thanks to independent animation studios such as Colory Animation or Red Cat Motion. Besides, 2D animation has also had a noticeable change, with the example of DeeDee Animation Studio. Because of the production costs of animation in Vietnam is relatively lower than the global average, Vietnaemse animation studios are usually selected as the outsourcing partners for international animation projects. Additionally, using animated videos also becomes a preferred video marketing strategy for several major brands in Vietnam, such as MILO or Lifebuoy. In late 2018, POPS Worldwide, with the funding from Lifebuoy, publish the animated series \\"The Silver iOn Squad\\", produced by DeeDee Animation Studio.

He was sent by the Patriarch Abdisho IV Maron (1555-70). In spite of the express approbation by Pope Pius IV (1565), he was not welcomed by the Latin Catholic Portuguese ecclesiastical authorities. He was given the title of \\"Metropolitan and Gate of All India\\" by the Pope, which is currently used by the Head and Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church. Introduction The last two East Syriac bishops of Malabar were Joseph Sulaqa and Mar Abraham; both arrived in Malabar after the arrival of the Portuguese.Encyclopaedia of sects & religious doctrines, Volume 4 By Charles George Herbermann page 1180,1181For details on Mar Jacob, Mar Joseph, and Mar Abraham cf. A. M. Mundadan, \\"History of St. Thomas Christianity in India\\", in George Menachery, Ed., The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. II, Trichur, 1973 pp.46-52, esp. the end notes.Also Joseph Thkkedath, History of Christianity in India, Vol.II, CHAI, Bangalore, 1982, Ch.3 pp.34-56. There is no doubt that Joseph Sulaqa's appointment was canonical, for he, the brother of the first Chaldean patriarch Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa, was appointed by his successor Abdisho IV Maron and sent out to Malabar. Mar Joseph was sent to India with letters of introduction from the Pope to the Portuguese authorities; he was besides accompanied by Bishop Ambrose, a Dominican and papal commissary to the first patriarch, by his socius Father Anthony, and by Mar Elias Hormaz, Archbishop of Diarbekir.

Mar Abraham in India East Syriac Metropolitan Mar Abraham inside the Madbaha of Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church, Angamaly While Joseph Sulaqa was leaving India there arrived from Mesopotamia another bishop named Mar Abraham, sent by Shemon VII Ishoyahb the East Syriac Patriarch. He succeeded in entering Malabar undetected at the appearance of another Chaldean who proclaimed himself a bishop. The people were greatly delighted and received him with applause; he at once set about holding episcopal functions and conferring holy orders, and quietly established himself in the diocese.Gouva, p. col. 2 Later, the Portuguese captured him and sent him to Portugal, but during the journey he escaped at Mozambique, found his way back to Mesopotamia, and went straight to Mar Abdisho IV Maron, the Chaldean Patriarch, having realized from his Indian experience that, unless he secured a nomination from him, it would be difficult to establish himself in Malabar. He succeeded admirably, obtained nomination, consecration, and a letter from the patriarch to the pope. With this he proceeded to Rome, and in an audience with the Pope disclosed his position.Du Jarric, \\"Rer. Ind. Thesaur.\\", tom. III, lib. II, p. 69 The Pope ordered the Bishop of San Severino to give him orders from tonsure to priesthood, and a Brief was sent to the Patriarch of Venice to consecrate him a bishop. The facts are attested, both as to the minor orders and the episcopal consecration, by the original letters found in the archives of the Church of Angamaly, where he resided and where he died. Metropolitan of Angamaly (1568-1597) Abraham succeeded also in obtaining his nomination as Archbishop of Angamaly from Pope Pius IV, with letters to the Archbishop of Goa and the Bishop of Cochin dated 27 February 1565. On arrival at Goa, he was detained in a convent, but escaped and entered Malabar. His arrival was a surprise and a joy to the people. He kept out of the reach of the Portuguese, living among the churches in the hilly parts of the country. In time he was left in peaceful occupation. As is usual in such cases the old tendencies assumed once more their ascendency, and he returned to his teaching and practices, Complaints were made by Jesuits; Rome sent warnings to Abraham to allow Catholic doctrine to be preached and taught to his people. At one time he took the warning seriously to his heart. In 1583 Father Valignano, then Superior of the Jesuit Missions, devised a means of forcing a reform. He persuaded Mar Abraham to assemble a synod, convening the clergy and the chiefs of the laity. He also prepared a profession of faith which was to be made publicly by the bishop and all present. Moreover, urgent reforms were sanctioned and agreed to. A letter was sent by Pope Gregory XIII on 28 November 1578, laying down what Abraham had to do for the improvement of his diocese; after the synod, Abraham sent a long letter to the pope in reply, specifying all that he had been able to do by the aid of the Fathers. This is called the first reconciliation of the Syrians to the Church. It was formal and public, but left no improvement on the general body, the liturgical books were not corrected nor was Catholic teaching introduced in the Church.see letter, pp. 97-99, in Giamil Rabban Hormizd Church, built by Mar Abraham Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church (Old Cathedral), built by Mar Abraham. Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church which houses the tomb of Mar Abraham After his escape from Portuguese detention in Goa, Mar Abraham returned to Angamaly in 1570. In the same year, he built his first cathedral church dedicated to Rabban Hormizd, a seventh century Abbot of the East Syriac Church, as its patron. In 1578, as a response to the requests made by Jesuit missionaries who had been working in Angamaly and in the other centres of the Saint Thomas Christians, the pope granted plenary indulgences to the Church of Rabban Hormizd, which the faithful could obtain four times a year for 25 years from the year of the election of Metropolitan Mar Abraham. The indulgences covered two feasts of the Patron Rabban Hormizd that fell on the fifteenth day after Easter (Monday) and on the first of September. On 15 August 1579, as requested by Mar Abraham, the Jesuits laid the foundation stone of a new cathedral namely \\"Rabban Hormizd\\" in the same place chosen by the Metropolitan.\\"The removal of Patrons and some Historical reflexions/‡¥™‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥±‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥® ‡¥™‡µç‡¥∞‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∑‡µç‡¥†‡¥ï‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥≤ ‡¥ö‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥Ç.\\" Sathyadeepam Weekly. 88 (25 March 2015): 5. The Synod of Diamper of the year 1599, prohibited the Christians from commemorating the feast of Rabban Hormizd, since Rabban Hormizd was considered a Nestorian heretic by the Latin missionaries. Session 3, Canon 14 of the Synod severely condemned Rabban Hormizd. According to the new regulations, the Synod commanded as planned by Archbishop Menezes that the Christians celebrate the feast of St. Hormizd, the Martyr (according to the Roman Martyrology published from Rome in 1583), a Persian Catholic saint who lived in the fifth century, suppressing the memory of Rabban Hormizd. The Feast was fixed on 8 August according to the Canon 10 of the Session 2 of the Synod of Diamper.\\"The removal of Patrons and some Historical reflexions.\\" 5, 16.Theodoret, \\"Historia Ecclesiastica: St. Hormisdas, a Persian martyr.\\" b. 5, c. 39.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5856 The efforts of Archbishop Menezes and the Portuguese missionaries to replace Rabban Hormizd as patron of St. Hormizd church with St. Hormizd the martyr is an instance of sixteenth-century attempts at forced Latinization. It is doubtful whether the Christians immediately accepted this change of patronage. Bishop Francis Ros, the first Latin bishop of the Saint Thomas Christians, attempted to get the decree of the Synod of Diamper accepted with the Second Synod of Angamaly that he convoked in December 1603.\\"Marichaalum Marikkaatha Mar Abraham/Mar Abraham, an Immortal Soul.\\" Sunday Shalome, vol. 16, No. 42, 25 October 2015, 2 St. Hormizd, the Martyr of Persia,http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/martyrs- christian is a historical person who lived in the fifth century in Persia. Later years and death In 1595, Mar Abraham fell dangerously ill but recovered.Du Jarric, tom. I, lib. II, p. 614 In 1597 he again became dangerously ill. Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes wrote and exhorted him to reform his people, but for answer only got frivolous excuses.Gouva, p. 2 He would not even avail himself of the exhortations of the Fathers who surrounded his bed, nor did he receive the last sacraments. Thus he died in January 1597.For details of the last days of Mar Abraham cf. Michael Geddes, \\"History of the Malabar Church &c.;\\", London, 1694, repr. George Menachery, Ed.Indian Church History Classics, Vol.I, Ollur 1998 pp.51-112 The viceroy made known his death to Archbishop Menezes, then absent on a visitation tour, by letter of 6 Feb. 1597. The Archdeacon during the first part of the reign of Mar Abraham was George of Christ, who was on friendly terms with the Latin missionaries and was to be appointed the successor of Mar Abraham as Metropolitan of India. Thus he should have become, according to the plans of Mar Abraham, supported by the Jesuits, the first indigenous Chaldaean Metropolitan of the St Thomas Christians. However, the last letter of Mar Abraham, in which he requests the Pope to confirm George's ordination as Bishop of Palur and his successor, is dated 13 January 1584, while from another letter of the same Mar Abraham we learn that the consecration of George failed because of the latter's death.Language of religion, language of the people: medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Ernst Bremer, Susanne R√∂hl Page 401 The tomb of Mar Abraham The tomb of Mar Abraham was discovered in September 2015, in the sanctuary of St. Hormizd Church in Angamaly on the occasion of the renovation of the church. This church has witnessed many of the revolutions of the Christians of St. Thomas in the past against the new Latin hierarchy imposed upon them after the Synod of Diamper. The Christians used to assemble around the tomb in order to discuss important matters and to adopt resolutions concerning their future proceedings. One of the resolutions at the tomb of Mar Abraham was made by all the Christians, immediately after his death in 1597. The second resolution was made in 1601, by about 200 Christians who withdrew their obedience to Francis Ros, S.J, the first Latin bishop of Angamaly.\\"Marichaalum Marikkaatha Mar Abraham/Mar Abraham, an Immortal Soul.\\" Sunday Shalome, vol. 16, No. 42, 25 October 2015, 2 A committee was appointed by Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry, at a meeting of Syro-Malabar Church Historians and Ecclesiastical Dignitaries held at Kochi to decide on the investigation, protection, and preservation of the tomb.

Reception Upon the PlayStation version's release, critics generally praised the graphics, techno soundtrack, variety of character designs, solid gameplay, and the way fighters can hang onto the edge of the ring, but criticized the difficulty in executing special moves and felt that some opponents were overpowered. They also noted similarities to the gameplay mechanics of the Virtua Fighter series. GameFan called Zero Divide \\"one of the best 3-D fighting games of all time\\" and praised \\"innovative little extras like dangling off the side of the ring and the transparent limb effect\\" as well as the Tiny Phalanx shoot 'em up minigame, concluding Zero Divide \\"to be one of the best designed, programmed, and tweaked fighting games yet.\\"GameFan, volume 3, issue 11 (November 1995), page 23 Next Generation remarked that while having android characters is innovative, the characters are generally so bizarre that they are difficult to identify with, and their generic move sets fail to justify their \\"outlandish\\" designs. Game Informer said it \\"has everything you would expect from a next generation fighter, lots of action, fast moving polygon fighters, tons of moves, and most importantly solid game mechanics.\\" Computer and Video Games stated that it is \\"in some ways even better\\" than the original Virtua Fighter and offers \\"serious competition\\" against Tekken, saying that Zero Divide is \\"better looking\\" and \\"more intuitive\\", concluding it to be \\"a stunning, finely-tuned game\\". GamePro concluded, \\"Although it lacks the solid fighting foundation that would make it great, Zero Divide has moments of greatness.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it 29 out of 40 (7.25 out of 10 average), saying it \\"grows on you.\\" Maximum gave it three out of five stars, calling it \\"an average beat 'em up destined to be ignored by discerning PlayStation owners.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, and stated that \\"It's easy to see the attraction.

It was designed and built in Sweden in the 1980s and led to a two-seat, slightly larger, development called the BA-14. Design and development The Sl√§ndan () was the first Swedish microlight apart from glider based types. It is built from composite materials, with a square section beam formed in two halves supporting the engine well ahead of the wing leading edge and extending aft continuously to the tail. The wings, rectangular in plan and with a high aspect ratio (10:1), are attached to the beam with dihedral of 1.5¬∞. Ailerons cover 30% of the trailing edge. The wing has two pressed spars, foam filled glass fibre ribs and Kevlar filled glass fibre sandwich skins. The butterfly tail surfaces are also rectangular and assisted by a short ventral fin with the same chord as the tailplane. The round nosed, single seat cabin is formed from six bonded pieces and mounted on the boom with its windscreen at the wing leading edge, placing the pilot below the wing at about one quarter chord. The sides are normally open though complete enclosure is an option. On each side a forward leaning bracing strut runs from the lower rear cabin to the front wing spar. The Sl√§ndan has a short, fixed, tricycle undercarriage with a steerable nosewheel; the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, are mounted on straight steel cantilever legs from the lower fuselage. There is a protective tailskid on the tip of the underfin. The prototype Sl√§ndan was initially powered by a (21 kW) (28 hp) K√∂nig SD 570 4-cylinder two-stroke engine though there were plans to replace this with a Lotus Magnum 2.25 when this type became available. At least three examples have been fitted with Rotax engines. The Sl√§ndan first flew in 1984 and by February 1985 MFI were assembling five more. It was agreed that later aircraft should be produced by the Royal Swedish Aero Club using MFI's moulds and tools. It was intended to market the Sl√§ndan in both flyaway and kit form. At about the same time, in a collaboration between MFI and FFK Aerotech, Andreasson was developing a slightly larger, two seat version called the FFV Aerotech BA-14 Starling.

An inquiry into the accident by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below. Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot, Lance Hopping, after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suggesting he may have been under the influence of cannabis at the time of the crash, which ultimately led to the error in judgement. The crash was the sixth transport accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol, and the commission has called for the government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation, marine and rail industries. The crash is the deadliest ballooning disaster ever occurred in New Zealand. It was also the deadliest air disaster to occur in mainland New Zealand since the 1963 crash of New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441, and the deadliest crash involving a New Zealand aircraft since 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 into Mount Erebus. Background The balloon was a Cameron A-210 model, registered ZK-XXF and named Mr Big. The envelope was manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1997, and was initially used in the United Kingdom before being purchased and imported into New Zealand by Early Morning Balloons Ltd in 2001. The basket and burner system, capable of carrying ten passengers plus pilot, were manufactured in 1989 and were previously used with a Thunder and Colt 160A envelope before the envelope was retired at the end of its useful life.TAIC interim report, p. 19 The balloon took off at 6:38 am from its launching area in Carterton, a town of 4100 people in north-eastern Wellington Region, on a 45-minute scenic flight over the Carterton area, carrying ten passengers.TAIC Final Report, para. 3.1.6 The Masterton-based pilot was one of New Zealand's most experienced balloon pilots, with more than 10,000 hours flying time, and was the safety officer for the \\"Balloons over Wairarapa\\" hot air balloon festival, held annually in March around the Carterton and Masterton area. The ten passengers were all from the greater Wellington Region: two husband-and-wife couples from Masterton and Wellington, a couple from Lower Hutt, a boyfriend and girlfriend from Wellington, and two cousins from Masterton and Paraparaumu. At the time, the weather was clear, with sufficient light and little wind. Data collected from weather stations at six nearby vineyards confirmed that the wind was mostly calm with occasional gusts up to from the north-east.TAIC Interim Report p.9 Crash The approximate final route of the balloon. The red star indicates where the balloon first came into contact with the 33 kV power line (the faint grey line from the east), while the red circle is where the balloon wreckage was found. The accident occurred around 7:20 am, when the balloon was attempting to land after completing a partial figure-8 flight pattern over the Carterton area. The pilot had indicated to the chase team he was likely to land near Somerset Road, a rural through road just north of Carterton in the locality of Clareville. At first the balloon was heading north-east over Somerset Road, around 700 metres east of the road's intersection with State Highway 2. Around 400 metres north of Somerset Road, the balloon reversed direction and headed back towards the road. The two chase vehicles, carrying some of the family members of the passengers, positioned on the road ready to assist with the landing.TAIC Interim Report, p. 2‚Äì3 Eyewitnesses saw the balloon climb and drift east towards a ten-metre high 33,000-volt power line running perpendicular to the road,TAIC Final Report, para. 3.2.2. one of the two lines that connected the Clareville zone substation, which supplied Carterton and the surrounding rural area, to the national grid at Transpower's Masterton substation. The pilot was heard shouting \\"duck down\\" as the balloon came in contact with the power line around 85 metres from the road. One of the conductor wires was caught over the top of the pilot's end of the basket, and the pilot attempted to get the balloon to climb, but the tension of the wire prevented it rising and instead the balloon slid along the conductor. Around 20 seconds later, electrical arcing occurred as the balloon caused a phase-to- phase short circuit, tripping the line and causing the 3800 properties supplied by the Clareville zone substation to lose power. The arcing caused one of the four liquefied petroleum gas bottles supplying the burners to rupture, and a fire subsequently started.TAIC Final Report, para 3.2.12. Two of the passengers jumped from the balloon to avoid the fire, falling ten metres to their deaths below. As the fire intensified, it caused the air inside the balloon to heat and force it to rise. Eventually, the conductor wire on the power line snapped, sending the balloon shooting upwards. The fire soon engulfed the whole balloon, and 150 metres in the air, the envelope disintegrated, causing the balloon to fall towards the ground, with the wreckage landing in a field just south of Somerset Road, around 600 metres east of the SH2 intersection.TAIC Interim Report, p.9 Emergency services were on the scene within seven minutes but, shortly after they arrived, ambulance staff found that all eleven people had died at the scene, and this was later confirmed by police. The bodies of the two people who jumped from the balloon were located from the crash site. Aftermath It took two days until 9 January to remove the last victims' bodies from the crash site. All eleven victims' bodies were taken to Wellington Hospital to be formally identified. The wreckage was examined at the scene, before being packed into a shipping container and transported to the TAIC's secure workshop in Wellington.TAIC Interim Report, p.1 Power to the Carterton area was restored shortly after the crash using the remaining subtransmission line and spare capacity in the 11,000-volt distribution network until the damaged line was repaired. The damaged power line conductors were removed from the scene for examination.TAIC Interim Report, p.1 A memorial was erected in January 2016 near the site of the disaster. Investigation The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) opened an inquiry to investigate the cause of the accident and to recommend any safety improvements in relation to the accident. The New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority was responsible for looking into any occupational health and safety and regulatory matters relating to the crash, while the United Kingdom's Air Accident Investigation Branch was contacted by the TAIC in case inquiries needed to be made in relation to the Bristol-based balloon manufacturer. The investigations could take up to a year to complete. On 15 February 2012, the TAIC released an urgent safety recommendation after investigators found apparent anomalies in the maintenance of the crash balloon. The recommendation to the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that they urgently check the maintenance practices and airworthiness, especially in relation to the inspection of burners, fuel systems and envelopes, and maintenance record-keeping, of the other 74 hot air balloons registered in New Zealand. The TAIC released its interim report on the accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket and one of the four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike.TAIC Interim Report, p. 8 Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher ‚Äì ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.TAIC Interim Report, p. 7-8 Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot found evidence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), indicating cannabis use.TAIC Interim Report p.8 The report was the second fatal aviation incident report released by the TAIC in two days in which crew members tested positive for cannabis, following on from the release of the final report into the 2010 New Zealand Fletcher FU24 crash, in which two of the skydiving instructors killed in the crash tested positive for cannabis. In February 2013, a report by the Civil Aviation Authority on the crash was released to The Dominion Post newspaper under the Official Information Act. The report found that the pilot's medical certificate had expired six weeks before the crash and he should have not been piloting a commercial aircraft. It also found that neither the rapid deflation system nor the parachute valve, which would have allowed for a rapid controlled descent, had been deployed despite there being sufficient time to do so, and passengers were not briefed in their emergency use. In April 2015, the findings of coroner Peter Ryan were revealed to the public. In the report, he described the accident as \\"entirely preventable\\" and caused by \\"a significant error of judgement\\" by the pilot. Although there was no proof the pilot had used cannabis before the flight, statements from people who knew him, as well as post-mortem forensic tests, revealed that he was a weekly cannabis user and the long term effects of using the drug could have had an \\"effect on his perception and thinking\\". Ryan also commented on issues with regards to safety standards in the industry, commenting on the \\"lack of enforcement\\" for mandatory drug and alcohol tests.

The band formed in 2005 in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Vindens√•ng was originally the solo project of front-man Jeffrey Neblock, but has since incorporated new members. The band seeks to ‚Äúcapture and reproduce atmosphere and emotion‚Äù in their music. History Formation and instrumental period (2005‚Äì2007) In early 2005, the band was formed as the solo project of Jeffrey Neblock. Soon after the conception of the band, material for the demo release Themes of Snow and Sorrow was written and recorded. The band‚Äôs sound began as instrumental ambient that incorporated elements such as piano and synthesizers, as well as frequently utilized sampling and effects. Terminus: Rebirth in Eight Parts... and live performance (2008‚Äì2011) Terminus: Rebirth in Eight Parts... marked a transitional point for the band: they had begun to incorporate vocals and a wider array of influences into their music. Terminus: Rebirth in Eight Parts... features vocals used to create atmosphere, as well as some more prominent vocal parts. The sound of the album has been described as a blurry mixture of styles that is ‚Äúhard to classify into one genre‚Äù. The album is influenced by dark ambient, drone, neofolk, and black metal. The production quality of the album and use of sound manipulation is a major part of its atmosphere, and at times individual instruments and sound sources are difficult to discern. With the release of Terminus: Rebirth in Eight Parts... on December 16, 2008, the band performed live for the first time, holding a small CD release party at the Strand Theatre in Lakewood, NJ. On August 14, 2010, Vindens√•ng performed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at The Rotunda to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the formation of the band. This show also featured Canadian neofolk act Musk Ox and Belgian ambient project Sequences. In March 2011, Vindens√•ng supported Agalloch on their Marrow of the Spirit tour in Baltimore, MD and Cambridge, MA. Second Full-Length and Upcoming Works (2012) As of October 2011, the band announced that they had entered the studio to record their second full-length album, and that they expect to be finished sometime in early 2012. On May 31, 2012, the band announced that a new album, titled Alpha, was set for release in September 2012, but was later delayed until 2014. Style and influences Because their style tends to blend many different genres and instruments simultaneously, Vindens√•ng has been described as ‚Äúhard to classify into one genre‚Äù. Jeffrey Neblock has described the band‚Äôs sound as ‚Äúambient-rock.‚Äù The members of Vindens√•ng have stated, ‚Äúall that we create can be interpreted as the embodiment of our spirituality, and all that we create is representative of our growing understanding of both ourselves and of the living universe that encompasses us‚Äù. They also express that the band was ‚Äúformed under the premises that nature is sacred‚Äù, and that all of their music will ‚Äúappropriately represent the sacredness of the natural world‚Äù. Jeffrey Neblock has stated that one of the goals of the band is \\"to preserve spirituality in music‚Äînot [to make] religious music, but rather music with spirit and music for the spirit\\". The members of the band have expressed that they identify most with Pantheism, and they are influenced and inspired by metaphysics and mythology.

He made his debut in an Essex Professional Cup semi-final game against Colchester United on 11 November 1954, but his involvement with the army disrupted his football career and he didn't play his first League game until 27 August 1956, against Blackburn Rovers.

He then moved to Rochdale and was a part of the team that reached the 1962 League Cup Final. During a spell at Chesterfield, Wragg was to witness the death of teammate Ralph Hunt when they were involved in a car crash on the way home from watching cup opponents Peterborough United on 17 December 1964.

The song, produced by Kanye West, Kenoe and No I.D., features a verse from American rapper J. Cole, Jay-Z's protege and the first artist to be signed to his Roc Nation label. In the song, Jay-Z recognizes rappers who have risen to fame in the last decade, such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne, T.I., Eminem and 50 Cent. Notably, Jay-Z also gives shout-outs to Mobb Deep, Nas and two artists whom he had previously insulted on his 2001 song \\"Takeover\\". Background and recording After graduating from college, J. Cole sought to attract the attention of Jay-Z in the hopes of working with him. Following several efforts, including increased social networking activity and seeking internships at recording studios, J. Cole was finally contacted by Jay-Z and invited to contribute to his eleventh studio album The Blueprint 3 (2009). Cole also subsequently signed a recording contract with Jay-Z's record label Roc Nation. The duo's The Blueprint 3 collaboration came in the form of \\"A Star Is Born\\", which features verses from the two rappers. The song was produced by Kanye West, Kenoe, and No I.D. and incorporates samples of the 1977 song \\"Touch Me\\" by R&B; group Mother Freedom Band. It was originally slated to have two verses performed by Jay-Z and one by J. Cole, but the former added a third verse during a recording session. Cole wrote his verse for \\"A Star Is Born\\" in about 45 minutes in the studio. Its chorus is performed by R&B; singer Tony Williams; an early version of the song featured vocals from both Williams and hip hop recording artist Kid Cudi, but only the former's contributions were ultimately used in the final mix. Williams himself was not aware of the prominence of his vocals on \\"A Star Is Born\\" until his friend Omar Edwards approached him and complimented his performance on the song. Critical reception \\"A Star Is Born\\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Charles Aaron of Spin praised its \\"anthemic, edgy soul-clap\\" beat and the two rappers' individual performances, lauding Jay-Z in particular as \\"effortlessly dazzling\\". Pitchforks Ian Cohen, however, dismissed the song as a \\"numbingly non-committal salutation\\" Alexis Petridis, writing for The Guardian, negatively described \\"A Star Is Born\\" as a \\"mass of indistinct tracks\\". Release and live performances \\"A Star Is Born\\" impacted urban contemporary radio in the United Kingdom on June 25, 2010, and it was added to the playlist of urban radio station BBC Radio 1Xtra the same date. On July 21, the song was added to the BBC Radio 1 playlist. While not officially released as a single in the United States, \\"A Star Is Born\\" peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart following the release of The Blueprint 3. J. Cole performed his verse on \\"A Star Is Born\\" at the 2010 BET Awards, where he also added an additional verse. Cole also performed the song at New York-based radio station Hot 97's 2010 Summer Jam concert.

Each municipality has, to complement the municipal council, a separate OCMW/CPAS council, appointed by the municipal council, not directly elected, except in the municipalities with language facilities of Voeren, Comines-Warneton and the six of the Brussels Periphery. The council is composed of 9 to 15 members depending on the population of the municipality. The fact that OCMW/CPAS is a separate institution from the municipalities is historical. In other countries, such social services are given by the municipalities themselves. The three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) are responsible for most local government matters. The Flemish Government plans to abolish its OCMW and integrate them into their respective municipalities by 1 January 2019.

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.  Early life  Spencer was the son of Robert Spencer, 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Francis Willoughby and Elizabeth Lyttelton. He was baptised on 21 October 1593. He was educated at Corpus Christi, Oxford in 1609 and was awarded BA in 1612. History of Parliament Online - Richard Spencer His brothers were Sir Edward Spencer, Sir John Spencer, and William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton.  Parliamentary career  In 1621, Spencer was selected Member of Parliament for Northampton. He was a student of Gray's Inn in 1624. In 1624 and 1625 he was re-elected MP for Northampton. He became a gentleman of the bedchamber in 1626. He was re-elected MP for Northampton in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.  Post-parliament actions  He was a J.P. for Kent by 1636. Spencer stood for parliament for Kent for the Long Parliament in November 1640, but withdrew before the election took place. He was imprisoned twice by the Long Parliament for promoting the moderate Kentish petition of 1642. He was a commissioner of array for the King in 1642, stood security for loans amounting to ¬£60,000 and helped to raise two regiments of horse, which he commanded at the Battle of Edgehill. He gave up his command in 1643 and was claimed the benefit of the Oxford Articles. He settled ¬£40 a year on the minister of Orpington and was allowed to compound for a mere ¬£300. However he became involved in the canal schemes of William Sandys and his financial condition became precarious. In 1651 he obtained a pass to France for himself and his family and settled in Brussels. He returned to England in about 1653 and was imprisoned and forced to pay off his debts. At the Restoration, Spencer petitioned unsuccessfully for positions which had been promised to him in reversion many years earlier. These included Provost of Eton and vice-treasurer of Ireland. He became JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Kent and commissioner for oyer and terminer on Home circuit in July 1660. By August 1660 he was colonel of militia for Kent. He became commissioner for assessment in August 1660, and commissioner for sewers in North Kent in September 1660. He was nominated by the Duke of York as court candidate for Rye in 1661 and elected to the Cavalier Parliament for the constituency, taking his seat having been absent from the Commons for 32 years.  Personal life and death  Spencer married Mary Sandys, daughter of Sir Edwin Sandys of Northbourne, Kent in 1628. They settled at Orpington, Kent, and had four sons and two daughters. Spencer died later in 1661 at the age of 68 and was buried at Orpington.

Cecchini (born December 9, 1944) is a former American football player and coach. He played college football as an All-Big Ten Conference linebacker at the University of Michigan, and he held coaching positions with Xavier University, University of Iowa, and the Minnesota Vikings. In two years as the head coach at Xavier, he compiled a record of 8-13-1\\\\. Football player Cecchini began his football career at Detroit's Pershing High School where he was selected as an all-city player in 1961. In the fall of 1962, Cecchini enrolled at the University of Michigan. As a sophomore, he started the first four games of the season as a two-way player at center and linebacker. He was selected by the UPI was the Midwest Lineman of the Week for his performance against Michigan State on October 12, 1963. One week later, he tore ligaments in his left knee in a game against Purdue and was lost to the team for the remainder of the 1963 season. After surgery on his knee, Cecchini returned to Michigan in 1964. He played 300 minutes, principally at linebacker, in Michigan's nine regular season games, helping the Wolverines to an 8-1 record and a Big Ten championship. He was again selected by the UPI as the Midwest Lineman of the Week for his role in Michigan's 10-0 victory over Ohio State. At the end of the 1964 season he was selected by the Associated Press (AP) as a first-team linebacker on the 1964 All-Big Ten Conference football team. In January 1965, Cecchini was voted by his teammates as captain of the 1965 Michigan Wolverines football team. He started all 10 games at linebacker for a 1965 team that saw its record drop to 4-6. At the end of the 1965 season, he was selected by both the AP and UPI as a second-team player on the 1965 All-Big Ten Conference football team. After leaving Michigan, Cecchini played for the Ypsilanti team in the Midwest Football League and was selected as a first-team, all-league linebacker in 1967. Coaching career After receiving his bachelor's degree from Michigan in 1966, he remained at Michigan as a member of Michigan's coaching staff. He also received a master's degree in education at Michigan. In 1970, he was hired as the defensive line coach at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. He served as the head football coach at Xavier from 1972 to 1973. At the end of the 1973 season, Xavier terminated its intercollegiate football program. In January 1974, he was hired as an assistant football coach at the University of Iowa, where former Michigan head coach Bump Elliott was employed as the athletic director. After seven seasons as an assistant coach at Iowa, he was hired as the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings in March 1980. Business career In 1984, Cecchini quit coaching to form a computer document processing company and a software company. In the mid-1990s, Cecchini's companies went out of business, and Cecchini filed for person bankruptcy. In September 1998, Cecchini was hired by Michigan athletic director Tom Goss as an associate athletic director at Michigan. In 1999, Cecchini became embroiled in controversy. Cecchini received a salary of $96,000 and bonuses of $12,800 at Michigan. The Detroit News reported that Goss stated that Cecchini had been making about $200,000 a year, but an investigation by the newspaper showed he had been a $38,400 employee of a Minnesota video technology company when he was hired by Goss. The News investigation also criticized Goss for following Cecchini's advice concerning the installation of new electronic scoreboards at Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena.

Gameplay The game features a combat system utilizing digital playing cards. The game itself is free, and players purchase packs of cards for the game with real money. Those cards represent allies that the player can use to battle enemies. The game can be accessed on Japanese smartphones and feature phones by going to a website hosted by GREE. Story Players run their own kingdom as the emperor, craft a unique history, and save the world from an unprecedented crisis. Situations, characters and villains from past SaGa games are present. Development Concept art for the game Takehiro Ando, a Square Enix executive in charge of social games, said that adapting the SaGa series to a mobile social game was difficult, especially since he grew up with the original games and did not want to upset longtime fans with too many changes. Pre release The trademark for the title Emperor SaGa was registered by Square Enix in September 2010. The game itself was announced at the 2011 Tokyo Game Show. GREE, the Japanese social platform, merged with OpenFeint in 2012, and Emperors SaGa was listed as a title that would be featured on the service. The artwork was designed by Tomomi Kobayashi. Square Enix ran a promotion pre-release that if players registered for the game before it came out, they received a rare in-game card, Andromache. The title is freemium, downloadable for free but allowing a player to purchase more content with in app purchases. The game was produced by GREE, the Japanese gaming social network. Reception Michael Baker of RPGamer heavily disliked the game when he played a demo of it. He found that much of the plot he saw was directly taken from earlier games like Romancing SaGa 2 and Romancing SaGa 3, that the gameplay consisted mainly of clicking on links, and the iPhone game was not responsive to input. 1UP.com listed the game as one of five classic Japanese mobile games unlikely to come to North America.

His work is exhibited in permanent collections around the United States. In 2009 de la Serna was selected for a \\"one man\\" exhibit at the Grounds For Sculpture Museum in Hamilton, NJ. He has given talks about his work and ceramic traditions at museums and galleries including the Denver Art Museum. De la Serna is a direct descendant of some of the earliest Spanish families to settle in New Mexico in 1598; he cites these deep cultural roots as both an influence and a guiding light for his artwork. He has been a consistent award winning artist at the annual Spanish Market in Santa Fe, NM numerous times since 1994.Spanish Colonial Arts Society; http://www.spanishcolonialblog.org/ de la Serna is seen as a mentor by many young artists. de la Serna has been collected by museums such as the Santa Fe Museum of International Folk Art, The Denver Art Museum, Grounds For Sculpture and the Albuquerque Museum. His work is in both private and corporate collections throughout the United and abroad, and he is represented by numerous galleries. Andrew Connors, Curator of the Albuquerque Museum has said of de la Serna's work: Career de la Serna studied art independently at the Instituto de Bellas Artes, Granada, Spain, the Sanchez Conservation, Santa Fe, the Museum of International Folk Art, Santa Fe, the Osona Gallery and Studio, Santa Fe, and Santos of New Mexico, Santa Fe. Much of de la Serna's time was spent studying the work of early New Mexican Colonial iconographers and the use of traditional tempera on panel techniques. This early work was quickly sought after by private collectors and museums. While not prolific in this genre, his work in retablos, bulto carvings and gesso relief earned him awards and respect. His work has been widely published in books and magazine articles. He is represented in the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art. de la Serna has notably helped to revive \\"gesso relief\\" and \\"Casitas\\" as a style type in American pottery.State of New Mexico, 2005, Legislative recognition In his pottery, de la Serna fuses both very early and modern New Mexican practices. His use of micaceous clay with its subtle sparkle, harkens back not only to the ancient traditions of mica flecked clay used by early Neolithic Iberians, Celti-Iberians, and the Taos and Picuris Pueblos, but also to the Hispanic people in New Mexico and early Spanish settlers in Santa Elena, la Florida (1566-1587) University of South Carolina: Santa Elena Charlesfort who also produced micaceous pottery during the colonial period and in the early nineteenth century in New Mexico. de la Serna hand-builds his pots using coil-and-scrap technology, and fires his pottery in the style of open pit kilns traditionally used by indigenous peoples. However, de la Serna's pottery, although indicative of ancient forms such as ollas and bean pots, are thoroughly modern. His minimalist, elegant lines are highly sculptural, and have moved beyond the concept of pottery in a practical sense. de la Serna's work is known for being executed with a high degree of technical prowess given the monumental sizes compared to those often rendered using the same techniques. The late Native American artist R.C. Gorman,R.C. Gorman Gallery praised de la Serna's work: \\"Jacobo creates from his soul, work that is poignant and sensual. A truly gifted man\\". After much success as a ceramic artist in 2010, de la Serna turned his attention to oil painting during the winter break from pottery.

Previously the seat of the Bishops of Venafro, it is now a co-cathedral in the diocese of Isernia-Venafro. History The cathedral is not only the biggest church in the city but is also one of the largest in the region. It stands at the foot of the Parco Oraziano, a park leading up into the surrounding mountains. At the end of the fifth century, the first Christian church on the site was constructed by Bishop Constantine over a pagan temple, reusing building materials from older buildings both Roman and Palaeo-Christian. This early building was subsequently plundered and fell into ruin. Bas-relief of Pietro of Ravenna (\\"Marzo Settecappotti\\") It was rebuilt in the second half of the 11th century by Bishop Pietro of Ravenna, commemorated by a bas-relief known locally, from its unusual appearance, as \\"Marzo Settecappotti\\" (\\"March Seven-Coats\\"). This building too had a dramatic existence: it was looted of all moveable goods by the troops of Emperor Frederick II, damaged by earthquakes in 1349 and 1456, set on fire by order of Louis XI of France and forced to accommodate the troops of Charles VIII in 1495. It was consequently subject to continual repairs, modifications and reconstructions. At the end of the 17th century the so-called Cappellone (\\"big chapel\\") was constructed (see below). From the end of the 17th century, and throughout the 18th, the cathedral was refurbished in the Baroque style: at the end of these substantial additions, the church was re-dedicated on 21 October 1764 by Bishop Francesco Saverio Stabile. The cathedral's present aspect is due to restoration works carried out in the 1960s and 1970s which removed the Baroque additions, returning it to a Gothic medieval appearance. Interior Interior, looking east along the nave The interior has three aisles decorated by pictorial work from the 14th century. The church has five portals: the one to the right of the main portal is a holy door (porta sancta) of 1508. Four side-chapels open off the southern aisle, while off the northern aisle is the very large chapel known as the \\"Cappellone\\", built in the late 17th century and remodelled in the 19th, for the administration and reservation of the sacrament. The chapel of the Crucifix (Crucefisso) was completed in the 16th century. The altarpiece is attributed to the school of Domenico Antonio Vaccaro. The marble bust (1795) of the cleric, (Primicerio) Antonio Rosario De bellis, was completed by Michele Coppa.Isernia Tourism Site External links * Diocesan website :Venafro Cathedral Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Italy Category:Cathedrals in Molise Category:Roman Catholic churches in Venafro Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1764 Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings ","title":"Venafro Cathedral"},{"id":"34311590","text":"The FCC label or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal Communications Commission.Federal Communications Commission.

In a career that lasted from July 1844 to May 1846 he ran four times and won only one race. That race, however, was the 1845 Epsom Derby, in which he recorded an unexpected victory. After one race in 1846 he was retired to stud where he made no impression as a sire. Background The Merry Monarch was a bay horse bred by his owner, William Gratwicke of Ham Manor, near Angmering in Sussex. Gratwicke also bred his dam, The Margravine, who was a sister to the 1829 Derby winner Frederick. His sire, Slane, was runner-up in the Ascot Gold Cup and, thanks largely to The Merry Monarch's Derby win, was Champion sire in 1845. The Merry Monarch was sent into training with John \\"Daddy\\" Forth who, at the age of sixty, had trained and ridden Frederick in the Derby. Gratwicke's horses were based at Goodwood at a stable owned by the Duke of Richmond. Following a disagreement with the Duke, Gratwicke moved his horses to Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1844: two-year-old season On his first racecourse appearance, The Merry Monarch ran in the Ham Stakes at Goodwood in July. He finished unplaced behind Refraction, a filly who went on to win The Oaks in 1845. 1845: three-year-old season The Merry Monarch's first race of 1846 was the Derby at Epsom. The build-up to the race was marred by reports of a plot to either lame or poison Old England, one of the favourites for the race, while another one of the leading contenders, The Libel, was allegedly drugged (\\"doctored\\"). Poor weather on the morning of the race did not deter the crowd, which was reported to be as large and unruly as ever. Ridden by the little-known Foster Bell, The Merry Monarch started at odds of 15/1 in a record field of thirty one runners. These official odds however, were offered jointly for The Merry Monarch and his stable companion Doleful: according to The Sporting Magazine, odds of 35/1 would have been more accurate reflection of the actual betting. The start of the race was delayed by almost an hour by a series of false starts and an incident in which one of the leading contenders, Alarm was kicked by The Libel. Alarm threw off his jockey, Nat Flatman, ran into a chain fence and then galloped loose down the course for several minutes before being caught. Both Alarm and Flatman were injured, but took part in the race when it eventually got under way. The Merry Monarch was among the leading group from the start, and was in fourth place at the turn into the straight, where one horse fell and several others were badly hampered. Approaching the final furlong, Bell sent The Merry Monarch to the front and he established a clear lead before staying on well to win \\"in clever style\\" by a length from Annandale, with Old England a neck away in third. The result was a major surprise to most observers, including, it was reported, the winner's own connections, who had believed that their other runner, Doleful, had the better chance of winning. In July, The Merry Monarch was sent to Goodwood for the Gratwicke Stakes. He finished second, beaten a head by Hersey, a mare whose only previous win had come in a \\"fifty pound plate\\". Despite his defeat, The Merry Monarch remained among the leading fancies for the St Leger, but he did not appear again that year. The Merry Monarch's prize of ¬£3,975 for the Derby was enough to make him the third highest money winner of the British season behind Refraction and Sweetmeat. 1846: four-year-old season On his only race as a four-year-old, The Merry Monarch returned to Epsom for the Grand Stand Plate, a mile and a quarter handicap on the day after the Derby. Carrying top weight of 118 pounds, he finished unplaced behind an unnamed colt owned by James Merry. Before the end of the year, The Merry Monarch changed hands three times. Following his run at Epsom he was bought by Lord George Bentinck, but a month later, Bentinck decided to give up his racing interests to concentrate on politics and sold all his horses for ¬£10,000 to Edward Lloyd-Mostyn. The Merry Monarch was put up for auction and bought back by his original owner, William Gratwicke for 78 guineas. Assessment The Sportsman magazine described The Merry Monarch as \\"a very bad horse\\" and his Derby win as the biggest \\"fluke\\" in the history of the race. The Farmer's Magazine concurred, calling the result \\"one of the greatest flukes that we have on record\\". Stud career The Merry Monarch stood as a stallion at his owner's stud at Ham, where his fee was initially 10 guineas. He attracted few mares however, and in only his second year at stud, he was covering mares at no fee apart from \\"a sovereign for the groom\\". He was the damsire of a filly named Bertha, who finished second in the 1000 Guineas and won the Nassau Stakes in 1862, but otherwise made no impact. Pedigree *The Merry Monarch was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Orville. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The line eventually stretched from Houston northward to Dallas and Denison, Texas. with branches to Austin and Waco. History 1871 map showing the Houston and Texas Central Railway in Texas, along with other railroads Ebenezer Allen of Galveston, Texas obtained the charter to establish a railroad company on March 11, 1848. A series of meetings about the establishment of the company occurred in Chappell Hill and Houston. In 1852, the Galveston and Red River Railway (G&RR;) company became active. The start of construction occurred on January 1, 1853, when Paul Bremond and Thomas William House broke ground in Houston. Track-laying of the gauge railroad began in early 1856. On July 26, 1856, the track-laying reached the point, at Cypress. The railroad company name changed from G&RR; to H&TC; on September 1, 1856. By April 22, 1861 the railroad construction had reached the point at Millican. Because of the Civil War, the railroad construction was halted. In 1867, with the war over, construction resumed. In 1867, the H&TC; railroad company took control of the Washington County Railroad (1856‚Äì1868). That railroad consisted of of railroad line between Brenham, Texas and Hempstead, Texas, which had been chartered in 1856 and completed in April 1861 with a gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. The H&TC; completed the line to Austin on December 25, 1871. H&TC; rails reached Corsicana in 1871, Dallas in 1872, and Red River City, Texas (now Denison) in 1873, where it connected with the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad. This formed the first all-railroad route from Houston to St. Louis, Missouri, and the Eastern United States for freight and passengers. The H&TC; was sold to Charles Morgan in March 1877 but continued to operate independently until 1927, when it was leased to the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The HT&C; was merged into the T&NO; in 1934. The T&NO; was merged into the SP in 1961, and the SP into the Union Pacific in 1996.

He was the son of Roger Rudder (c. 1687‚Äì1771), a shopkeeper and pig-killer. Rudder ran a printing and bookselling business in Cirencester in the 1750s and wrote and published several works on the history of Gloucestershire. Samuel married Mary Hinton (1724‚Äì1800) on 22 June 1749, the daughter of a maltster, and it has been speculated that Mary might have been related to the Cirencester printer Thomas Hinton. A New History of Gloucestershire Rudder's A New History of Gloucestershire was compiled from printed questionnaires, which he said made him very troublesome to his friends, Sir Robert Atkyns' Ancient and Present State of Glostershire (1712), and an unpublished manuscript history of the City of Gloucester by the Rev. Richard Furney. The work was well received by critics and Horace Walpole described it as \\"the most sensible history of a county that we have had yet\\". The work had taken him twelve years to complete during which time a competing work had been published and Rudder was forced to deny rumours that he had abandoned the work.

These are the standard measures of beak size in Decapodiformes; hood length is preferred for Octopodiformes. They can be used to estimate the mantle length and total body weight of the original animal as well as the total ingested biomass of the species.Clarke, M.R. (1962).

He was also the personal barber of Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Though not involved in the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, Santiago D√≠az's barbershop was attacked by forty armed police officers and U.S. National Guardsmen. The attack was historic in Puerto Rico‚Äîthe first time an event of that magnitude had ever been transmitted live via radio and heard all over the island. The Nationalist Insurrection of 1950 Early years Santiago D√≠az was born and raised in Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico where he received his formal education. He later moved to Santurce, a mostly working-class section of San Juan, where he became a professional barber. Santiago D√≠az was greatly troubled by the inhumanity and violence of the Ponce massacre. Nineteen were killed, including 1 policeman caught in the cross-fire. The Washington Post, Tuesday, December 28, 1999; Page A03. John Marino. \\"Apology Isn't Enough for Puerto Rico Spy Victims\\".

Ponce massacre The Ponce massacre. Police kill 17 unarmed Puerto Ricans on Palm Sunday, including a 7-year-old girl, who was shot in the back. On Palm Sunday, March 21, 1937, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party held a peaceful march in the city of Ponce. This march was meant to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873. It also protested the imprisonment by the U.S. government of Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos on charges of sedition. The innocent Palm Sunday March turned into a police slaughter. Both march participants and innocent bystanders were fired upon by the Insular Police, resulting in the death of eighteen unarmed civilians and one policeman‚Äîevery one from police fire as none of the civilians carried any firearms.Ponce Massacre, Com. of Inquiry, 1937. Ponce Massacre, Commission of Inquiry, 1937. LLMC Central. The Law Library Microform Consortium. Kaneohe, HI. 2012. Retrieved 12 January 2012. In addition, some 235 civilians were wounded, including women and children. Journalists and photojournalists were present. The news was reported throughout the island the following day. Furthermore, a photo appeared in the newspaper El Imparcial, which was circulated to members of the U.S. Congress.19 Were killed including 2 policemen caught in the cross-fire, The Washington Post Tuesday, December 28, 1999; Page A03. \\"Apology Isn't Enough for Puerto Rico Spy Victims.\\" The Insular Police, a force resembling the National Guard, had been trained by U.S. military personnel. They were under the command of General Blanton Winship, the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, who gave the order to attack the Ponce march on Palm Sunday. Insular Police . Sal√≥n Boricua Santiago D√≠az worked as a barber at 351 Calle Colton (Colton Street), Esquina Barbosa (at the corner of Barbosa Street) in Barrio Obrero in a shop called Sal√≥n Boricua. The word Boricua is synonymous with Puerto Rican and is a self- referential term which Puerto Ricans commonly employ. The word is derived from the words Borinquen and Borik√©n (the name which the native Ta√≠nos gave to the island before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors). In his book War Against All Puerto Ricans,\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony\\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Page 164-165; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); ; . Denis states that Santiago D√≠az purchased the barbershop in 1932 from Jos√© Maldonado Rom√°n, who was ailing from throat cancer, thus becoming the sole owner of the business. This has been disputed by several sources. Sal√≥n Boricua was often frequented by Jos√© Grajales and Ram√≥n Medina Ram√≠rez, both leaders of the Nationalist Party of San Juan, and often served as a Nationalist meeting place. Santiago D√≠az also befriended party leader and president Pedro Albizu Campos, who himself became a regular customer. Over time, Santiago D√≠az became Albizu Campos' personal barber and one of his most trusted advisors.Stephen Hunter & John Bainbridge, Jr., American Gunfight, p. 271; Simon & Schuster pub., 2005; Federico Ribes Tovar, Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutionary, pp.107-110; Plus Ultra Educational pub., 1971Marisa Rosado, Pedro Albizu Campos: Las Llamas de la Aurora, pp.357-358; Ediciones Puerto pub., 2008; Events leading to the revolt On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the Independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)\\" by Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico. On June 21, 1948, Albizu Campos gave a speech in the town of Manat√≠, where Nationalists from all over the island had gathered in case the police attempted to arrest him. Later that month Albizu Campos visited Blanca Canales and her cousins Elio and Griselio Torresola, the nationalist leaders of the town of Jayuya. Griselio soon moved to New York City where he met and befriended Oscar Collazo. Uprisings The National Guard, commanded by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General Major General Luis R. Est√©ves and under the orders of Gov. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, occupy Jayuya From 1949 to 1950, the Nationalists on the island began to plan and prepare an armed revolt, hoping that the United Nations would take notice and intervene on their behalf. The revolution was to occur in 1952, on the day the United States Congress was to approve the creation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Estado Libre Asociado of Puerto Rico in Spanish; this translates into English as the Free Associated State of Puerto Rico). The reason behind Albizu Campos' call for an armed revolt was that he considered the \\"new\\" status a colonial farce. The police disrupted this timetable and the Nationalist revolution was accelerated by two years. On October 26, 1950, Albizu Campos was holding a meeting in Fajardo when he received word that his house in San Juan was surrounded by police waiting to arrest him. He also was told that the police had already arrested other Nationalist leaders. He escaped from Fajardo and ordered the uprising to start. The following day the police fired upon a caravan of Nationalists in the town of Pe√±uelas and killed four of them. This police massacre caused an immediate outcry. The first armed confrontation of the Nationalist uprisings occurred early on the morning of October 29, in the Barrio Macan√° of Pe√±uelas. The Insular Police surrounded the house of the mother of Melit√≥n Mu√±iz Santos, the president of the Pe√±uelas Nationalist Party in Barrio Macan√°, under the pretext that he was storing weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired upon the Nationalists in the house and a firefight between both factions ensued, resulting in the death of two Nationalists and the wounding of six police officers.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza. by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez. Page 7. Publicaciones REN√â. Nationalists Meliton Mu√±iz Santos, Roberto Jaume Rodr√≠guez, Estanislao Lugo Santiago, Marcelino Turell, William Guti√©rrez and Marcelino Berr√≠os were arrested and accused of participating in an ambush against the local Insular Police.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 7; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; The very next day, October 30, saw Nationalist uprisings throughout Puerto Rico, including Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising) and San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt). Despite the turmoil caused by an island-wide revolt, all accurate news reports were prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. Instead, the entire revolt was called \\"an incident between Puerto Ricans\\" . NY Latino Gunfight at the Sal√≥n Boricua A wounded Vidal Santiago D√≠az is carried out of his barbershop by the police and U.S. National Guard Upon learning that the police wanted to arrest Albizu Campos, Santiago D√≠az, who then was the president of the Santurce Municipal Board of Officers of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party,\\"FBI Files\\"; \\"Puerto Rico Nationalist Party\\"; SJ 100-3; Vol. 23; pages 104-134. sent a telegram to the Attorney General of Puerto Rico in the early hours of October 31, 1950, offering his services as an intermediary. He then opened his barbershop to await an answer which never arrived. Instead, unbeknown to Santiago D√≠az, fifteen police officers and twenty-five National Guardsmen were sent that very afternoon to lay siege to his barbershop. As they surrounded Sal√≥n Boricua, these forty armed men believed that a large group of Nationalists were inside and sent a police officer to investigate. Santiago D√≠az believed that he was going to be shot by this officer and armed himself with a pistol. The situation escalated quickly. Santiago D√≠az shot first and the police fired back‚Äîwith machine guns, carbines, revolvers, and even grenades. The firefight lasted three hours. It finally ended when Santiago D√≠az received five bullet wounds, one of them to the head. A staircase also collapsed on him. Outside in the street, two bystanders and a child were wounded. This gun battle between forty heavily armed policemen and National Guardsmen and one barber made Puerto Rican radio history. It was the first time an event of this magnitude was transmitted live via the radio airwaves and the entire island was left in shock. The reporters who covered the event for Radio WKAQ and Radio WIAC were Luis Enrique \\"Bib√≠\\" Marrero, V√≠ctor Arrillaga, Luis Romanacce and 18-year-old Miguel √Ångel √Ålvarez.Premio a Jes√∫s Vera Irizarry Thinking he was dead, the attacking policemen dragged Santiago D√≠az out of his barbershop. When they realized he was still alive, Santiago D√≠az was sent to San Juan Municipal Hospital. He was hospitalized with fellow Nationalists Gregorio Hern√°ndez (who attacked La Fortaleza, the governor's mansion) and Jes√∫s Pomales Gonz√°lez (one of five Nationalists assigned to attack the Federal Court House).\\"El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza\\"; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 7; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; Aftermath After the police assault at the Sal√≥n Boricua, Santiago D√≠az recovered from most of his wounds but not from the gunshot to his head. Upon release from the hospital he was arrested and taken before a federal judge to face charges of \\"intent to commit murder\\" and other events related to the Nationalist uprisings of October 1950. Although he did not participate in the uprisings, he was convicted and sentenced to serve seventeen years and six months in prison at the Insular Penitentiary in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. On October 14, 1952, Santiago D√≠az was granted a pardon of all charges related to the cases concluded or pending against him by Puerto Rican Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. The governor specified that Santiago D√≠az's activities on behalf of Puerto Rican independence were not to be curtailed, unless they advocated the use of anti-democratic methods, force, or violence. The pardon was conditional, under the supervision and control of the Insular Parole Board. Upon receiving this pardon, Santiago D√≠az was immediately freed. Later years Santiago D√≠az never fully recovered from his head wound and moved with his wife to Santa Juanita, Bayam√≥n. He ceased his political activities in the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and became a member, and eventually a deacon, of the Disciples of Christ Church. Although he had some fingers missing and his head wound was very noticeable and impressive, he did worked for many years as a barber in the barber shop of the \\"Hotel Capitol\\" in Miramar, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Santiago D√≠az died in March 1982 at his home in Bayam√≥n.

In the late 1980s it was nicknamed \\"Death Valley\\" due to high levels of drug-related and violent crime. Since a 1989 raid Link Valley has not had significant criminal activity.

Robert Cullick, a member of the Houston Chronicle Austin bureau, said that as the apartments were built, residents of nearby residential subdivisions shunned them because the apartment residents were transient and of a lower socioeconomic status. The residential neighborhoods were deed restricted, preventing rental units from being built within. This caused apartments to be concentrated in the same areas. The apartments did not have recreational facilities. Cullick believed that the isolation caused Link Valley to become a crime-ridden area in the 1980s.Cullick, Robert. \\"Was Death Valley inevitable?\\" Houston Chronicle.

As Greater Houston developed, newer and more luxurious apartment complexes further away from the city core opened. Gradually the Link Valley apartments lost favor. The large number of apartments in Greater Houston caused prices of renting apartments in Link Valley to decrease. As a result of the 1980s oil glut, Houston's real estate market declined. The landlords were forced to further reduce rents, but there were insufficient tenants to keep the apartments profitable. In Link Valley many of the apartments were bankrupt and foreclosed. Jeff Kunerth of the Orlando Sentinel said that a \\"general abandonment\\" occurred. The apartments became known for drug dealing and vagrancy. After an elderly woman in a nearby community was murdered by residents of the area, homeowners put pressure on the city to clean up the community. A 1989 raid removed many drug dealers, vandals, vagrants, and drug addicts from the Link Valley community. In 1991 the City of Houston financed the demolition of several derelict structures in Link Valley.Liebrum, Jennifer. \\"Former \`Death Valley' area on its way back.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Crime In the late 1980s the community was known for having an abundance of drug-related criminal activity. Houstonians (Houston citizens) nicknamed it \\"Death Valley\\" because many drug-related homicides occurred there. In a period over 10 years ending in 1989, many drug dealers and prostitutes operated in the area. Kim Cobb of the Houston Chronicle said that Link Valley's apartments, which were mostly vacant, appeared \\"like a war zone, buildings with broken windows, high weeds, boarded up buildings and an assortment of prostitutes and junkies.\\"Cobb, Kim. \\"Zeroing in on \`Death Valley\`/Shocked neighbors turning up heat on drug nest\\" (Archive).

Retrieved from Google Books on January 8, 2012. , Police believed that some apartments were used as crack houses. Cocaine traffickers drove away landlords who tried to board windows or make other improvements to the complexes. One drug establishment used flashlights to manage traffic of people intending to buy drugs. The Police arrested hundreds of people at Link Valley on a yearly basis. Due to overcrowding in Houston jails, many of those caught served shorter sentences than they otherwise would, and many drug dealers arrested by police were replaced by other dealers. Sergeant J. W. Collins of the Houston Police Department Southwest Patrol Division said that the factor that aggravated the trade was the fact that Link Valley was in close proximity to the 610 Loop. Many drug customers from across Houston traveled to Link Valley to buy drugs. They used the 610 Loop to quickly enter and exit the Link Valley area. A customer would take the Stella Link exit off of 610, then drive down Link Valley Drive and receive his or her drugs. After the drug purchase, the customer would travel to the 610 Loop feeder roads via a side street, and quickly leave Link Valley. Collins said that many of the drug customers were White Americans who were casual drug users, and he recalled that powdered cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, was the main drug purchased at the complex. Collins added that, while many White casual drug consumers would feel nervous entering a black neighborhood, where they would more easily stand out and attract attention of law enforcement and violent criminals, in Link Valley they could easily enter and leave the community, so they felt more confident in buying drugs there. Link Valley was so popular that it frequently drew faraway visitors; some patrol officers said that vehicles with Louisiana license plates frequently appeared at Link Valley. History of criminal activity 3859 Tartan Lane in Braeswood Place was the site of the murder of Gloria Pastor in 1988, which led to the cleanup of Link Valley. Collins said that the drug trade appeared in early 1986, spreading from one complex to another within a space of several month. Collins said that, by 1987, his station's officers had visited the complexes on a daily basis. In 1988 the police forces made 200 drug-related arrests in Link Valley. Jeff Kunerth of the Orlando Sentinel said \\"[w]ith the crime had come a Wild West lawlessness. The utility company stopped replacing street lights because the bulbs were constantly being shot out. Police responding to reports of gunshots, drug deals and dead bodies entered Death Valley with guns drawn.\\" From January 1, 1988 until mid-December 1988, the Houston Police Department received 825 emergency calls, made hundreds of narcotic-related arrests.

Police arrested him in Pastor's van.Cobb, Kim. \\"\`Death Valley' apartment owners told to help fight drugs or face suits.\\" Houston Chronicle. Friday December 16, 1988. A43. Retrieved on January 7, 2012. The Pastor murder lead to members of the Braeswood Place community and other nearby communities into putting pressure on the city government, asking for a cleanup of the Link Valley area. Members of civic clubs traced the owners of the apartments and demanded that they begin expelling the drug trade, or else they would face lawsuits. Residents of some neighborhoods north of the South Loop discussed proposals to raise money to buy and tear down apartment complexes. Raid on Link Valley Sergeant J. W. Collins decided that denying the drug dealers usage of abandoned buildings, which were violating city codes and were not safe for human occupancy, would cause the criminal element to leave, so he proposed having them demolished. Originally the City of Houston municipal government agencies did not support his proposal. After the Pastor murder occurred, pressure was placed on the municipal government. The Stella Link Redevelopment Association, a group intending to improve communities across Stella Link Road, had formed. The head of the newly established group, formed by the heads of local civil associations, asked the police officers for help. The police and the neighborhood groups decided to form a partnership. The police department decided that it needed to scare away the customers and to remove the physical deterioration that housed the drug dealers. The Braeswood Place, Knollwood Village, Linkwood, Townhouse Manor, Westridge, Westwood, Willow Meadows, Woodshire and Woodside civic clubs all promoted the crackdown. Rodney Ellis of City Council District D, which represented Link Valley; and Vince Ryan of City Council District C, which represented the subdivisions supporting the crackdown, partnered with the subdivisions. In January 1989 the police announced that they would be conducting a major sweep of the Link Valley complex.Sparrow, Malcolm K., Mark H. Moore, and David M. Kennedy.

On the 27th police placed checkpoints and roadblocks, cordoning off Link Valley. One hundred police officers entered the complex to find that, due to the publicity of the upcoming raid, the drug dealers and other criminals had already fled with their weapons and drugs. The raid announcement had evicted drug addicts, drug dealers, vagrants, and vandals. Police discovered cellophane packages that were used to hold crack cocaine. On January 28 of that year, 400 volunteers from surrounding subdivisions picked up trash and cut down weeds that had grown waist-high. The trash included glass tubes, used syringes, and other drug paraphernalia. A trained crew wearing rubber clovers used eighteen dumpsters and two front loaders to clear the debris. The citizens cleared of trash, enough to fill ten semi-trailer sized garbage dumpsters.Sparrow, Malcolm K. Imposing Duties: Government's Changing Approach to Compliance.

In all of the surrounding neighborhoods, calls for \\"Part I\\" crimes, such as arson, assault, automobile theft, burglary, larceny, and murder had decreased. In some communities reports decreased by 12%.

Collins, the head of the Beechnut Police Station's Tactical Response Team, stated that according to an HPD study of the crime statistics comparing those of January to May 1989 to January to May 1988, after the Link Valley complexes closed, Class 1 and Class 2 crime decreased in Westridge. In Linkwood Class 1 crime did not change, and Class 2 crime declined by 23%. In Westwood, Class 1 crime decreased by 3 percent and Class 2 crime decreased by 23%. According to the report, there were decreases of both Class 1 crime and Class 2 crime in neighborhoods surrounding Link Valley. Class 2 crime increased in Woodshire while Class 1 crime decreased; the Woodshire statistic included statistics from Link Valley itself; Collins stated that his sole explanation on why Class 2 crime figures increased was because they occurred as police officers conducted surveillance at Link Valley. In the six-month period in the Woodshire area, Class 1 crimes decreased by 11% and Class 2 crimes increased by 34%. In 1991 Dean E. Murphy of the Los Angeles Times said that \\"much of the area is still run down, but residents and police remain upbeat; they believe their partnership is working.\\" During that year Don Graff, the co-chairperson of the association, said that rampant drug crime had not occurred in the community since the cleanup.

Yet, when he tries to make his dream of a great unite Empire between Macedonians and Persians reality, his army starts to doubt his ideals and to critique his way of adapting to Persian customs at court. As his companions slowly yet gradually wonder about their king's choices, Alexander's life gets a sorrowful turn. He loses his wife Barsine, his loved horse Bucephalus, his best friend Hephaestion and his tutor Leonidas in the most brutal of ways. Even his own life is now in danger, with some of his warriors planning to kill him twice. He has to execute the warriors who planned for his assassination as well as a friend of his that had heard of the plan but did not inform him. This torments him, but he knows he does not have choice. He finds refuge in the Iliad and other poems, where in the past he found sources of inspiration for battle tactics. He stops eating food and falls ill, and the only thing that gives him strength to go on and chase his immense dream is love. He meets and falls in love with Queen Roxane, who also gives the great gift of becoming father of a son. He is also named Alexander. He then tries to push forward towards India, as conquering it would mean that the whole of Asia would be in his hands, but his warriors' homesickness gets too much to bear. Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinies at the Hyphasis River, refusing to march farther east. Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general Coenus pleads with him to change his opinion and turn back. Alexander then has to march backwards towards the now far Macedonia and, during this very last part of his journey, he falls ill again. His friends get worried about his deteriorating conditions and it seems nothing can save the man whom pushed the boundaries of human capability. During the last few days of his life, unable to walk, he lets every one of his warriors walk into his tent and by its bed for a last farewell. And it also gives the opportunity to the sorrowful Macedonian soldiers to pay their tribute to their epic and heroic king.

From 1829 to 1833 she lived in the Portuguese colony of Macau on the South China coast and she and her sickly aunt became the first American women to go to China. During her stay from 1829 to 1833, she wrote a journal in the form of letters to her older sister Molly (Mary Ann, 1808‚Äì1851), and became acquainted with many of the influential individuals in the colony. After her return to the United States, she married and moved to London, returning to New York with her husband and five daughters in 1848. Her journal is now part of the Low-Mills collection in the Library of Congress. Biography She was born Harriet Low, the second of twelve children of Seth and Mary Porter Low, in Salem, Massachusetts.Lamas, Everything in Style, p. 2. Her father was a well-to-do merchant and owner of a successful shipping business among the ports of Salem, New York, London, and Canton (modern-day Guangzhou). A leading citizen of Brooklyn, Seth Low was one of the founders of the Unitarian church in that city.(American Unitarian Association) The Unitarian Register, 76 (26 July 1900:827). As one of four daughters in a large family, Harriet engaged in many household tasks, including sewing and mending. In 1829 her uncle, American trader William Henry Low, and his wife Abigail Knapp Low (1795‚Äì1834), prepared to move to China for a five-year stay. While William Henry Low would be managing business interests for Russell & Co. in Canton, which was off- limits to women, his wife would be staying in Macau. They asked Harriet to accompany them and provide companionship for her aunt. The party boarded the Sumatra for a four-month voyage across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which included a three-week stopover in Manila.Lamas, Everything in Style, p. 18. Harriet arrived in Macau on September 29, 1829,Lamas, Everything in Style, p. 20. and took up residence at 2, P√°tio da S√©, at the top of Cal√ßada de S. Jo√£o. She soon became acquainted with many of the well-known residents of Macau, including the painter George Chinnery, who painted her portrait; the Hong Merchant Mowqua; and the surgeon Thomas Richardson Colledge. Through her uncle's connections, she also became familiar with all the employees of the East India Company along with other prosperous British merchants in the city. As the only unmarried young woman in the colony, she was invited to many \\"fancy balls, dances, teas and dinners\\". Low had a strong desire to visit Canton, the only foreign trading enclave permitted in China at the time. However, under the regulations of the Thirteen Factory System, women were strictly forbidden from entering. Low and her aunt dressed up like boys, sailed to Canton, and went straight to the American Factory. When the Chinese discovered the women's true identities, they threatened to stop all trade in Canton forthwith, forcing Low and her aunt to leave. During her stay in Macau, Low became secretly engaged to William Wightman Wood, a young naturalist from Philadelphia who was a founder and editor of the Canton Register, one of the first English language newspapers in China. When she informed her uncle of the engagement, he objected to her marrying a \\"penniless adventurer\\" and forced her to break off the arrangement. In 1833 Low posed for a portrait by George Chinnery. She wore a low-cut dress in the latest fashion from Calcutta, with the sleeves stuffed with down pillows. In 1833 Harriet departed China with the aunt and uncle to return to Salem. Her uncle, who was seriously ill, died on the way back to the United States. In 1836 she married John Hillard (1813‚Äì1859), a son of English parents who was born in Richmond, Virginia.Loines, The China Trade Post-Bag, p. 18. The couple settled in London, where John was a partner in a large bank. They had three sons and five daughters. Only the girls survived; Mary Hillard Loines was active in the women's suffrage movement. In 1848 Hillard's bank failed and the family returned to the United States, moving in with Harriet's father in Brooklyn, New York. Hillard became \\"unstable and sick\\" and was unable to work.Lamas, Everything in Style, p. 285. After his death in 1859, Harriet was supported by her family until her death in 1877. Seth Low, a president of Columbia University, and mayor of Brooklyn and of New York, was her nephew, the son of her brother Abiel Abbot Low. Journal Harriet described the multicultural experiences of life in the city under Portuguese administration and the social life of its Anglo-American residents in a journal in the form of letters to her older sister, Mary Ann. She described the many opportunities for socializing at dinners, parties, and balls, and entertainment in the form of musical evenings, card games, amateur theatre, and operas. The women passed the rest of their time reading, writing letters, sewing, learning languages (Harriet learned Spanish), going out on walks, horse riding, and gossiping. As a Unitarian, Harriet was uncomfortable with the dominance of the Catholic religion in Macau.Lamas, Everything in Style, pp. 113‚Äì117. Her journal entries from 1829 to 1834 filled nine volumes,Taketani, U.S. Women Writers, p. 94. a total of 947 pages.Lamas, Everything in Style, p. xii. In 1900 her daughter Katharine printed an abridged version of the diary under the title My Mother's Journal: A young lady's diary of five years spent in Manila, Macao, and the Cape of Good Hope from 1829-1834. A re-edited version, including letters that Harriet wrote to her family, was printed by her granddaughter, Elma Loines, in The China Trade Post-Bag in 1953. The journal was printed in its entirety in Lights and Shadows of a Macao Life: The journal of Harriett Low, travelling spinster, Part I (2002), edited by Nan P. Hodges. As a first-person account, the journal is regarded as an important historical document for researchers of the China trade.

Around that time, Duke Glad ruled Banat, according to the Gesta Hungarorum (a chronicle of debated reliability). Archaeological finds and 10th-century sources evidence that Magyars (or Hungarians) settled in the lowlands in the early , but the survival of Avar, Slav and Bulgar communities can also be documented. A local chieftain, Ajtony, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy around 1000, but his attempts to control the delivery of salt on the Mure»ô River brought him into conflict with Stephen I of Hungary. Ajtony died fighting against the royal army in the first decades of the . His realm was transformed into a county of the Kingdom of Hungary. Counties (which were established around royal fortresses) were the most prominent units of royal administration. Featuring items of the \\"Bijelo Brdo culture\\" (the dominant archaeological culture of the Carpathian Basin between around 950 and 1090) can be detected in the lowlands from around 975. Artefacts from the Byzantine Empire or imitating Byzantine objects were found along the Danube, and in the Banat Mountains. Pagan burial rites disappeared by the end of the , evidencing the local inhabitants' conversion to Christianity. Gerard, the first Bishop of Csan√°d (now Cenad in Romania), played a preeminent role in the process, according to hagiographic works written centuries later. More than a dozen monasteries (including at least three Orthodox monasteries) were established in the region before the mid-13th-century. The Mongol invasion of Hungary brought severe destruction in 1241‚Äì42, causing the disappearance of dozens of villages. After the withdrawal of the Mongols, new fortresses, made of stone, were built. Cumans settled in the lowlands around 1246. Their traditional nomadic way of life gave rise to conflicts with their neighbors for decades. Charles I of Hungary held his royal residence in Timi»ôoara between 1315 and 1323. Colonization contributed to the development of the noblemen's estates in the . The presence of Vlachs (or Romanians) in the Banat Mountains can be documented from the same century. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkan Peninsula forced thousands of Bulgarians and Serbs to leave their homelands and settle in Banat. Louis I of Hungary made several attempts to convert his Orthodox subjects into Roman Catholicism in Banat in the 1360s. The region became an important frontier zone after the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. The isp√°ns (or heads) of Temes County were tasked with the defence of the frontier, which enabled them to unite most counties of Banat under their rule and to administer all royal fortresses in the region.  Background  Banat is the modern name of the southeastern region of the Carpathian Basin in Central Europe. It is located between the rivers Danube, Tisza and Mure»ô, and the Apuseni Mountains. The Avar Khaganate was the dominant power of the Basin between around 567 and 803. Most historians agree that Slavs and Bulgars, together with the remnants of the Avars, and possibly with Vlachs (or Romanians), inhabited Banat after the fall of the khaganate. Contemporaneous sources only sporadically mentioned political events in 9th-century Banat. Archaeological finds that can certainly be dated to the are also rare. The only cemetery which yielded possibly 9th- century artefactsIncluding \\"K√∂ttlach-type\\" earrings with bludgeon-like pendant. was discovered at Deta, but similar objects were in use till the early . After the disintegration of the Avar Khaganate, the Carolingian Empire and the First Bulgarian Empire made attempts to control Banat. Place names of Slavic origin recorded already in the Middle AgesFor instance, B√¢rzava and Vicinic. show the early presence of a Slavic-speaking population. The Royal Frankish Annals listed the Praedenecenti among the Slav peoples who sent \\"embassies and presents\\"Royal Frankish Annals (year 822), p. 111. to the Carolingian Empire in 822. The same source identified the Praedenecenti as Obotrites who \\"live in Dacia on the Danube as the neighbors of the Bulgars\\"Royal Frankish Annals (year 824), p. 116. when mentioning their envoys' visit in Aachen in 824. The term \\"Dacia\\" always referred to the ancient Roman province of Dacia Traiana (instead of the southern Dacia Aureliana) in 9th-century Western European sources, which suggests that the Praedenecenti lived to the north of the Danube, near its confluence with the Tisza. Around 850, a list of the peoples who lived along the eastern borders of the Carolingian Empire mentioned the Merehani as the southernmost neighbors of the empire to the north of the Danube. According to a scholarly theory, refuted by most specialists, the source suggests that the polity mentioned by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus as \\"great Moravia, the unbaptized\\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 40), p. 177. was located in Banat. Glad's late 9th-century duchy and its neighbors (a map partially based on the narration of the Gesta Hungarorum, a late 12th- century chronicle of debated credibility) Historians agree that the Bulgarian Empire dominated Banat during most of the . No contemporaneous source explicitly substantiates this idea, but the Bulgars' attempts to conquer their neighbors' territories are documented. The envoys of the Praedenecenti \\"complained about vicious aggression by the Bulgars and asked for help against them\\" during their visit in Aachen in 824. A Bulgar military commander, Onegavonais, drowned in the Tisza around 830, according to an inscription found at Provadia. Archaeologists often attribute a specific burial practice documented in the 9th and (the burial in coffins together with meat offerings) to the Bulgars, but the same burial rite had already been practised in the Avar Khaganate. Such graves cluster at the confluence of the Mure»ô and the Tisza, but graves with coffins and meat offerings were also unearthed at Nikolinci, Mehadia and other places in the lowlands. The name of the river Kara≈°, which is of Turkic origin, may have been inherited from the Bulgars, but it may also be attributed to the Pechenegs or other Turkic peoples who settled in Banat. The first recorded invasion of the Magyars (or Hungarians) from the Pontic steppes to Central Europe occurred in 861. The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin started around 894. The contemporaneous Regino of Pr√ºm recorded that the Magyars \\"attacked the lands of the Carinthians, Moravians and Bulgars\\"The Chronicle of Regino of Pr√ºm (year 889), p. 205. shortly after their arrival. The first extant Hungarian chronicle, the Gesta Hungarorum, which was written centuries after the events, contains a more detailed narration of the Hungarian Conquest. The chronicle wrote of one Duke Glad, who had come \\"from the castle of Vidin\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 11.), p. 33. in Bulgaria and ruled Banat at the time of the arrival of the Hungarians. Glad's army was \\"supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs\\", according to the same source. Historians debate whether Glad was a historical figure, or the unknown author of the Gesta Hungarorum invented him and his duchy to be able to write of the Magyars' heroic deeds during the conquest of their new homeland.  Kingdom of Hungary   Towards integration ( 900‚Äì1003 or 1030)  The appearance of Hungarian tribal names in settlement names, according to S√°ndor T√∂r√∂k (Banat is located in the southeastern region of the Carpathian Basin) A new burial horizon (documented at about forty places in the lowlands) appeared in Banat in the late . Small cemeteries and solitary burials feature it, showing that the nearby communities lived in small groups. The deceased were buried together with the skull or legs of their horses and with saddles, stirrups or other horse equipments. Sabers, swords, composite bows, quivers or other weapons, and ornamented belts were also placed in the graves of warriors. In women's graves, hairpins, earrings of the so-called \\"Saltovo\\" type bracelets, pendants, collar ornaments and buttons were found. The earliest graves of this \\"steppe burial horizon\\"For instance, at Dude»ôtii Vechi and Teremia Mare. were found near the confluence of the Tisza and Mure»ô. They yielded no artefacts of Byzantine provenance. From the 930s, artifacts which either represented a new style emerging in the Carpathian Basin,Including, bracelets decorated with animal heads and double heart-shaped appliqu√©s. or were copied after Byzantine patterns were placed in the graves. The \\"steppe burial horizon\\" can archaeologically be detected till the last decades of the . There are about a dozen 10th-century cemeteries with burial assemblages that differ from the \\"steppe burial horizon\\". The north-south orientation of a child's grave at Uivar and the deposition of a Byzantine coin in the child's mouth imply the presence of Bulgars. The deposition of coins in the mouth (\\"Charon's obol\\") was also documented in 10th-century graves found at Or»ôova and Deta. The \\"K√∂ttlach-type\\" artefacts found at Deta have been attributed to Slavs from Carinthia, but other finds (including ornamented belts) may also indicate a multicultural community, using imported goods. Burial assemblages yielding artifacts from the Balkan Peninsula have been documented in about a dozen cemeteries, especially in the southern region. These isolated graves and small cemeteries may show the presence of a distinct ethnic group, or prove commercial contacts with the Balkan Peninsula. Both the custom of \\"Charon's obol\\" and the graves of the \\"South Danubian burial horizon\\" were attributed to the Vlachs (whose presence in Banat is mentioned in later sources), but neither hypotheses have been universally accepted. Historians, who say that the Vlachs were present in the region already in the ,For instance, Viorel Achim and Radu Popa. propose that the Vlachs either migrated to Bulgaria or fled to the Banat Mountains after the arrival of the Hungarians. Around 950, Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus recorded that Hungarians inhabited the region to the north of the Iron Gates. He mentioned five riversthe Timi»ô, the \\"Toutis\\",Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 40), p. 177. the Mure≈ü, the Cri≈ü and the Tiszathat flow through the Hungarians' territory. Medieval settlements named after Hungarian tribesFor example, Jeneu (at present-day Denta in Romania), (Egyazas)ker (near today's Ostojiƒáevo in Serbia), and (Erdizad)kezi (now Chesin»õ). confirm that Hungarian communities settled in the lowlands already in the . Rivers, mountains and settlements bearing Hungarian names in the Middle AgesFor instance, the river Fize»ô, the AlmƒÉj Mountains, and the village SecƒÉ»ôeni. also show the presence of Hungarian-speaking groups. The Byzantine historian John Skylitzes wrote of a Hungarian chieftain, Gylas, who was baptized in Constantinople in the early 950s. On this occasion, a Greek monk, Hierotheus was ordained \\"bishop of Turkey\\"John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811-1057 (11.5), p. 231. (that is bishop of Hungary) to accompany Gylas back to his homeland. Bishop Hierotheus \\"converted many from the barbaric fallacy to Christianity\\", according to Skylitzes. Traditional scholarly consensus holds that Gylas ruled Transylvania (to the east of Banat), but the concentration of Byzantine coins minted between 948 and 959 at the confluence of the Tisza and the Mure≈ü may indicate that Gylas's seat was located in Banat. The only 10th-century pectoral cross (a small copper cross) in the region was discovered at Deta. Ajtony's realm (often mentioned as \\"voivodeship\\" in Romanian historiography) A new cultural synthesis, the so-called \\"Bijelo Brdo culture\\", emerged in the Carpathian Basin in the middle of the . Lock rings with S-shaped ends were its featuring items, but typical objects of the \\"steppe horizon\\" also survived, and the graves also yielded artefacts made after Byzantine patterns. The first cemeteries of this horizon, with their graves arranged in rows, appeared around 975, especially in the northwestern lowlands. In the large \\"Bijelo Brdo\\" cemeteries, graves of warriors (men buried with sabers or swords) were surrounded by hundreds of graves that did not yield weapons. According to an edict of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II, issued in 1019, the Orthodox Bishopric of Braniƒçevo had had a parish in \\"Dibiskos\\" during the reign of Samuel of Bulgaria, who died in 1014. Basil II confirmed the jurisdiction of the bishop of Braniƒçevo in the same parish. Dibiskos seems to have been located near the Timi»ô (known as Tibiscus in Antiquity), suggesting that an Orthodox parish existed in Banat in the first decades of the . Historian Alexandru Madgearu also associated six 11th- and 12th-century churches excavated near the Mure»ôAt Cenad, P√¢ncota, SƒÉv√¢r»ôin, Mini»ô, Mocrea, and Sz≈ëreg. with Eastern Orthodoxy. The Long Life of Saint Gerard (an early-14th- century compilation of earlier sources) wrote of a powerful chieftain, Ajtony, who had his seat in \\"urbs Morisena\\" on the Mure≈ü around 1000. Ajtony's ethnicity is subject to debates among historians: he is proposed to have been of Hungarian, Kabar, Pecheneg or Bulgar stock. The Gesta Hungarorum described Ajtony as the descendant of Glad which gave rise to his presentation as the last member of a \\"native dynasty\\" in Romanian historiography. Ajtony was baptized in Vidin and established a monastery for Greek monks in his seat. He owned innumerable cattle and horses and wanted to levy tax on the salt delivered from Transylvania to Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, according to the Long Life of Saint Gerard. The king sent Csan√°d (Ajtony's former retainer who had deserted him) at the head of the royal army against Ajtony. Csan√°d defeated and killed Ajtony in a battle at an unspecified date (either around 1003 or around 1030).  Before the Mongol invasion ( 1003 or 1030‚Äì1241)  Martyrdom and funeral of Bishop Gerard of Csan√°d (from the Anjou Legendarium) Stephen I of Hungary made Csan√°d the isp√°n (or head) of a new county, established in Ajtony's former realm, according to the Long Life of Saint Gerard. The counties were administrative units organized around fortresses, which were initially all possessed by the monarchs. According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Csan√°d County included the whole Banat at the time of its establishment. It was mentioned for the first time in a royal charter in 1165. Stephen I granted large estates to Csan√°d in Ajtony's former domains. Ajtony's former seat (which was renamed after Csan√°d) became the see of a bishopric of the Latin rite. A Benedictine monk from Venice, Gerard, was ordained bishop of Csan√°d in 1030, according to a record in the Annales Posonienses. The Greek monks, who had settled in Ajtony's seat, were transferred to a monastery that Csan√°d established for them at Banatsko Aranƒëelovo; their former monastery was granted to Benedictine monks. Bishop Gerard's legends claim that the Christianization of Banat occurred peacefully. Many people visited Gerard, bringing horses, cattle, sheep, carpets, golden rings and necklaces (the most valuable goods of a nomadic society) to the saintly bishop, to receive baptism from him. However, the burying of warriors together with their horses and other pagan customs survived for decades. Bishop Gerard also referred to his conflicts with heretics in his Deliberatio supra hymnum trium puerorum. He was murdered in Buda during the great rebellion of pagan Hungarians in 1046. The earliest cemeteries of the second phase of the \\"Bijelo Brdo culture\\" yielded coins minted during the reign of Stephen I. Thereafter only coins struck for Hungarian monarchs were deposited in 11th-century graves. The growing number of graves with deposited coins coincided with the gradual disappearance of featuring items of the \\"steppe burial horizon\\". Some \\"Bijelo Brdo\\" cemeteriesFor instance, the cemeteries excavated at Tara≈°, Kikinda and Banatsko Arandjelovo in Serbia, and at Cenad in Romania. did not yield any \\"steppe\\" artefacts; instead, twisted or braided wire rings and other artefacts copying Byzantine style were put into the graves. Around 1100, a new burial horizon appeared in the Banat MountainsFor instance, at Cuptoare, Svini»õa, and Caransebe»ô. and along the Danube,For example, at Banatska Palanka and Vojlovica. with graves arranged in rows, yielding artefacts imported from the Byzantine Empire or inspired by Byzantine style. Lock rings with S-shaped ends and other featuring \\"Bijelo Brdo\\" artefacts were also found in the same cemeteries. The deceased were buried with folded arms; their graves contained no weapons or food offerings. This \\"second South Danubian horizon\\" may represent either the development of a new fashion (influenced by contemporaneous Byzantine style), or the arrival of a new population. Archaeological research evidence that 11th- and 12th-century peasants lived in huts which were partially dug into the soil. A rectangular hut with rounded corners, dated to the late 11th or early 12th century, was excavated at Ilidia. It was in size; its entrance was a small corridor on its northeastern side. Similar dwellings from the 12th and were excavated at Gornea and Moldova Veche. Most semi-sunken huts had simple open fireplaces in the center or near the wall, but ovens were also found in some buildings. The local inhabitants used wheel-made vessels, especially jars, which were decorated by simple incisions and impressions. Bishop Gerard's hagiographies referred to the use of quern-stones in local households in the early . A 12th- century smithery was found at Gornea. The Byzantine Empire and Hungary waged a series of wars against each other between 1127 and 1167. The Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos routed a Hungarian army at Haram on the Danube (at present- day Baƒçka Palanka) in 1128. Thereafter he seized and sacked the nearby fortress. A Byzantine army also broke into Hungary at Haram in 1162. After the Byzantine Empire disintegrated in the early , Byzantine style went out of fashion in Banat: both burial assemblages of the \\"second South Danubian horizon\\" and Byzantine coins disappeared. Neither can elements of the \\"Bijelo Brdo\\" burial assemblages be detected after around 1200. The graves of the \\"Late Arpadian burial horizon\\" did not contain weapons and food offerings. Instead of ornamented belt mounts, finger rings decorated with lilies or double crosses became important symbols of social status both in the lowlands and the mountains. Many 13th-century cemeteriesFor example, the cemeteries at Tiszasziget, Timi»ôoara, Vr≈°ac, and Re»ôi»õa. developed in places that had not been previously occupied. Benedictine monastery at Araƒç (in present-day Novi Beƒçej in Serbia) New administrative units appeared in the sources. Temes County was first mentioned in 1172, Krass√≥ County in 1200, Keve County in 1201 or in 1238, and Arad County in 1214. The land between the Cerna River and AlmƒÉj Mountains was incorporated in the newly established Banate of Severin (a border province of the Kingdom of Hungary) in the 1230s. The forts at Cenad and Haram were rebuilt in the early . Margaret (the sister of Andrew II of Hungary, and widow of the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos) held the forts at Ilidia and Kovin in 1223. Archaeological research has proved that a manor existed on a hill at Ilidia. Historian Dumitru »öeicu says that the fort at Ilidia evidences the process of the implementation of the Hungarian monarchs' rule among the local Vlachs in the early 13th century, because royal charter from the next century referred to the Vlachs living in the region of Ilidia. The existence of new monasteries is documented from the early . The Benedictines owned abbeys at Araƒç, Bulci, Chelmac, Frumu»ôeni and ≈ûemlacu Mare; the Cistercians had a monastery in Igri»ô; Augustinian canons set up a house at GƒÉtaia; and unidentified monks settled at Bodrogu Vechi, Bodrogu Nou and Pordeanu. Orthodox monasteries existed at Kusiƒá and Parto≈ü. Local Pecheneg groups were first mentioned in 1230. In that year, King Andrew II of Hungary's son, B√©la, reclaimed the Pechenegs' village, located near Igri»ô, that his father had granted to Isp√°n Nicholas Cs√°k. The Pechenegs had obviously settled much earlier, but the circumstances of their arrival are unknown. Pecini»ôca, Peceneaga Valley and similar place names indicate that Pecheneg groups were also present in other places. B√©la IV of Hungary allowed the Cumans whom the Mongols had defeated in the Pontic steppes to settle in the lowlands of Hungary in 1237. The Cumans' nomadic way of life caused conflicts with the local inhabitants who accused them of cooperating with the Mongols. After the supreme leader of the Cumans, K√∂ten, was murdered near Pest in 1241, they left Hungary and settled in Bulgaria.  Mongol invasion and its consequences (1241‚Äì1316)  Mongol invasion of Hungary, 1241‚Äì42 (from the Illuminated Chronicle) rotunda in Kiszombor, Hungary The Mongols stormed into Hungary in March 1241. Roger of Torre Maggiore, a priest from Naples, gave a detailed description of their invasion. He fled from Oradea to Cenad, but a Mongol army had meanwhile seized and destroyed the town. The Mongols also captured Igri»ô Abbey and pillaged the neighboring territory. The Mongols withdrew from Hungary in March 1242, after having devastated large territories for months. According to historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy, about 50-80 per cent of the settlements in the lowlands of Banat were abandoned during the Mongol invasion. He refers to a 1232 royal charter that listed 19-20 villages, out of which only 4 settlements were mentioned in documents written after the Mongol invasion. Archaeological research also evidences that many cemeteries were abandoned in the mid-13th-century, although the opening of new cemeteries at other places during the same period is also documented. Most royal fortresses, which were made of earth and timber, were abandoned and new stone forts were erected. √ârdsomly√≥ (near Vr≈°ac) was first mentioned in 1255, and Caransebe»ô in 1290. Or»ôova and Timi»ôoara developed into important centers of commerce. Genoese merchants who delivered their goods from the Black Sea to Buda travelled through the two settlements, according to a 1279 royal charters. B√©la IV persuaded many Cumans to return to Hungary in 1246. They were settled on royal domains in the Great Hungarian Plain. The Cumans enjoyed an autonomous status, but they were required to respect the property rights of the Hungarian noblemen and the Church. Two Cuman tribes settled in Banat, the Borchols and the Koors. Graves yielding torcs and other objects that are similar to 13th- century finds from the Pontic steppes were excavated at Toma≈°evac and Boto≈°. Place names recorded in the For instance, Kunfalva (\\"Cumans' village\\" in Hungarian) in Csan√°d County, and the river Buhui. also indicate the presence of Cumans or other Turkic-speaking groups. The Cumans converted to Christianity, but their conversion was only superficial for almost a century. B√©la IV divided the kingdom with his son and heir, Stephen V, in 1262. Stephen, who adopted the titles \\"younger king\\" and \\"lord of the Cumans\\", received the lands to the east of the Danube. The kingdom was reunited when B√©la IV died in 1270. Hungary plunged into anarchy during the reign of Stephen V's son, Ladislaus IV, who succeeded his father at the age of ten in 1272. Ladislaus was declared to be of age in 1277. A papal legate, Philip, Bishop of Fermo, persuaded him to make a promise to force the Cumans to abandon their pagan customs and to adopt a settled way of life. The Cumans rose up in 1280 and decided to leave Hungary. Although the royal army defeated them near Lake H√≥d to the east of the Tisza in 1280 or 1282, the Borchol tribe from Temes County and an unnamed nearby tribe managed to flee from the kingdom. Most lords and prelates refused to obey the king in the late 1280s. Although Ladislaus's successor, Andrew III, was recognized as lawful monarch in 1290,the most powerful barons (or oligarchs) ruled their large domains independently of the monarch. After Andrew III died in 1301, no claimants to the throne could stabilize their positions for years. Taking advantage of the anarchy, Ladislaus K√°n, Voivode of Transylvania, expanded his authority in the early . He seized the domains of the Archbishops of Kalocsa in Krass√≥ County. A member of the Csan√°d clan, Theodore Vejtehi, entered into an alliance with Michael Shishman of Bulgaria and took control of the territory between the Timi»ô and the Lower Danube. Charles I of Hungary, who had been crowned king of Hungary in 1310, captured Vejtehi around 1315, but Vejtehi's sons were only forced to give up their fortress at Mehadia more than six years later.  Age of Angevins (1316‚Äì1395)  Charles I moved his court to Timi»ôoara in early 1315 and fortified it. Building projects evidence that he planned to set up a new royal residence in the town, but he returned his seat to the middle of Hungary in 1323. During Charles I's reign, new stone fortresses were built,For instance, at Jdioara, ≈ûemlacu Mare and Or»ôova. not independently of Charles I's conflicts with Basarab I of Wallachia. Franciscan friars settled in Lipova, Or»ôova and other places, Dominicans in Timi»ôoara, and Pauliens in GƒÉtaia before the middle of the . The Franciscans promoted a simplified version of Gothic architecture. Abutments excavated in Berzovia suggest that a Gothic church was built in the village after around 1350. Agricultural techniques are documented from the . Manured plowing lots were first mentioned in 1323. Archaeological evidence of the shoeing of horses can be dated to the same century. Frequent references to conflicts in connection with horses and oxen show the importance of draft animals in local economy. Pork was the most important meat in the peasants' diet, according to archaeological evidence from Remetea. Fishing, and hunting for wild boars, deer, aurochs, beavers, martens and badgers in medieval Banat is also well-documented. Local noblemen practised falconry. counties in Banat and the neighboring territories around 1370 Vineyards existed at Ciortea, Banatska Subotica and Reca»ô. Water mills functioned along the rivers Nera, Cara»ô, B√¢rzava and PogƒÉni»ô. Mills yielded significant income to the noblemen, because the peasants were to grind their wheat there. The Himffys earned a yearly income of 5,5 florins from the mills in their domain at Remetea. In 1372, Louis I prescribed that the peasants along the Timi»ô were to be use the royal mills. The iron mines in the Dognecea Mountains were the monarchs' property. Regional fairs held at \\"Bodugazonfalwa\\" (near Cenad), Semlac, Veliko Sredi≈°te and other villages were mentioned in 14th-century royal charters. Timi»ôoara and Lipova were the most prosperous towns in Banat. Local noblemen invited \\"guest settlers\\" to their estates, granting them tax exemption for three years and the right to free movement. The Cuman Isp√°n Kondam settled peasants at Beba Veche and at \\"Halazmortva\\" (near Senta in Serbia) in 1321, the Telegdis invited \\"guest settlers\\" to their five villagesBanatski Mono≈°tor, \\"Weresdub\\" (near the river Aranca), Banatsko Aranƒëelovo, Pordeanu and \\"Keer\\" (near present-day Ostojiƒáevo in Serbia). in 1337. Notable people also moved to Banat during the . Ladislaus J√°nki, Archbishop of Kalocsa, conducted negotiations with one Voivode Bogdan, son of Mikola, on King Charles's behalf about the movement of the voivode and his people \\"from his country\\" (Serbia or Wallachia) to Hungary between the autumn of 1334 and the summer of 1335. Charles I's son, Louis I of Hungary, granted more than ten villages near the Reca»ô River to the six sons of a Wallachian lord, who had \\"left all their estates and goods\\" in their homeland after a conflict between King Louis and Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia. Royal charters from the evidence that Vlachs (or Romanians) were present in Banat. The first recorded place name of Romanian origin\\"Caprewar\\" from CƒÉprioara was mentioned on a list of the Telegdis' villages in Arad County in 1337. By the end of the century, a dozen Vlach districtsFor instance, Sebe»ô and \\"Comyath\\" (on the PogƒÉni»ô River were mentioned in 1369, B√¢rzava (along the upper course of the epynomous river) in 1370, Mehadia in 1376 or 1387, Lugoj in 1385, Caran in 1391. were mentioned in Banat. The Vlachs' local leaders, who were titled either as knezes or voivodes, were mentioned from around 1350. Their residences and the Orthodox churches built in their estates can archaeologically be documented from the same century. At Re»ôi»õa a dwelling tower was erected on a hill, at Berzovia a wooden manor was built on a hill near the B√¢rzava River in the second half of the century. Written sources do not reveal which Orthodox bishopric had jurisdiction over the Orthodox parishes in Banat. The Orthodox Vlachs were not required to pay the tithe which was payable by all Catholic peasants to the Church. In 1328, Pope John XXII stated that the obligatory payment of tithes was one of the main obstacles of the conversion of non-Catholics (including Cumans and Vlachs) in Hungary. The Vlachs paid a special in kind tax, the quinquagesima (or \\"fiftieth\\") after their sheep, which shows that sheep-breeding was their principal economic. Conflicts relating Vlach knezes were also mentioned in royal charters. In 1333, the noble Paul Magyar's servant and Knez Bratan jointly invaded the Himffys' estates at Remetea-PogƒÉnici; in 1357, three Vlach knezes sued the noble John Beseny≈ë for two estates on the upper course of the Kara≈° in 1357, stating that Charles I of Hungary had granted them the estates; in 1364, the noble Andrew Torma accused Knez Demetrius of Comyan of having destroyed his estate at \\"Zlawotynch\\" (near present-day GƒÉtaia). According to historian Ion-Aurel Pop, these acts of violence demonstrate the knezes' attempt to protect their ancient property rights against the Hungarian noblemen. Historian Istv√°n Petrovics writes that the pastoralist way of life of the Vlachs, who were newcomers in Banat, gave rise to their conflicts with their more settled neighbors. Louis I of Hungary, who made several attempts to expand his authority over Wallachia and Bulgaria, regarded the southern region of Banat as an important military zone. He confirmed the privileges of the Pechenegs who lived in their village in Csan√°d County, stating that they had \\"the duty to bear arms according to ancient custom.\\" After the conquest of Vidin in Bulgaria in 1365, Louis I decided to convert the local Orthodox population into Roman Catholicism. His chronicler, John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë, also recorded that Louis I ordered the nobles and townspeople of Keve and Krass√≥ Counties to gather the local \\"Slavic together with their children, wives and all their possession\\" to be again baptized according to Catholic rite. According to a royal charter issued in 1428, Louis I also decreed that only Catholic noblemen were allowed to own landed property in the region of Caransebe»ô.  Ottoman threat (1395‚Äì1526)  Filippo Scolari, isp√°n (or head) of Temes County and other six counties in the early 15th century (fresco by Andrea del Castagno) 15th-century tower in Vr≈°ac (Serbia) The Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I launched a crushing defeat on the united army of Hungary, Wallachia and Western European crusaders in the Battle of Nicopolis on 25 September 1396. Shortly thereafter, thousands of refugees came from Bulgaria to Banat and settled in the region of Lipova. Sigismund of Luxemburg, who had been king of Hungary since 1387, held a Diet in Timi»ôoara in October 1397 to increase the defence of Hungary against the Ottoman Empire. A decree adopted at the Diet prescribed that each noblemen were to equip an archer from every peasant tenants on their estates. Sigismund made the Italian Filippo Scolari isp√°n of Temes and other six counties in southeastern Hungary in 1404. The isp√°ns of Temes still held royal castles and the domains attached to them in their county. Scolari rebuilt and strengthened the fortresses, and erected 14 new forts along the Danube. Sigismund granted large domains (including Beƒçkerek and Vr≈°ac in Banat) to Stefan Lazareviƒá, Despot of Serbia, in 1411 to strengthen his loyalty. Scolari's death in 1426 put an end to the united administration of the seven southern counties. Lazareviƒá also died in 1427 and his domains in Hungary were inherited by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, the new Despot of Serbia. Ottoman documents from the 1570s mention seven Eastern Orthodox monasteries in the mountainous region. The existence of four of themThe monasteries at Kusiƒá and Bazia»ô, and at the rivers Mraconia and Sirinia. can also be archaeologically evidenced. The simple tri-clone plan of the churches (which appeared in Serbia in the 14th century and also spread in Wallachia) show that they were erected after around 1400. Sigismund granted all royal possessions in Banat and the Banate of Severin to the Teutonic Knights in 1429. The Knights estimated the expenses of the defence at about 315,000 golden florins a year. To meet the expenses, they were granted significant sources of income, including the royal revenues from two Transylvanian mints, the taxes paid by the J√°sz people and the Cumans for two years and the \\"fifth\\" levied on the Vlachs for three years. However, the Ottomans seriously defeated the Knights in 1432 and they abandoned Banat. John Hunyadi and Nicholas √öjlaki, who were also voivodes of Transylvania and counts of the Sz√©kelys, were jointly made the isp√°ns of Temes, Arad, Csan√°d, Keve and Krass√≥ Counties in 1441, thus again uniting the administration of most Banat. Hunyadi granted nobility to at least five Vlach knezes in Temes County after the Diet of Hungary elected him governor of the kingdom in 1446. The new status of the local knezes did not influence the position of the Vlach commoners who lived in the knezes' estates, because they preserved their liberties, including their right to be judged by elected jurors. Ladislaus V of Hungary mortgaged the office of the isp√°n of Temes, along with all royal fortresses and domains attached to it, to Hunyadi in 1455. The administration of the southern frontier was again reformed during the reign of Hunyadi's son, Matthias Corvinus. He granted the new title of \\"captain general of the inferior parts\\" to the isp√°n of Temes County, tasking him with the defense of all royal castles on the border from Belgrade to Turnu Severin in 1479. The new official was also authorized to collect all royal taxes in the southern counties. Paul Kinizsi, Isp√°n of Temes, and the voivode of Transylvania, Stephen B√°thory, joined forces to expel Ottoman marauders from Transylvania in 1479. Being exposed to raids from the Ottoman Empire, the settlement structure of Banat underwent significant changes from the beginning of the 15th century. The Cseri domain in Temes County included more than 70 villages inhabited by Hungarian or Vlach peasants in the early 15th century, but more than 50 of them had been abandoned by the first decade of the 16th century. Out of the 168 settlements where Catholic parishes were documented in the 14th century, only about 115 survived till the mid-16th century. Most of the surviving villages were inhabited by Serbs. Serbs came to the southern region in five major waves during the reigns of Sigismund and Matthias Corvinus. They settled in the lowlands of Keve, Krass√≥, Temes and Torontal Counties where Catholic peasants had lived a century earlier, according to papal registers. During Corvinus's reign, thousands of mainly Serbian peasants were granted the status of vojnik (\\"warrior\\"). They were exempted of taxes, but they were required to provide military service on the frontier. Paul Kinizsi was one of the main supporters of Vladislaus, King of Bohemia, who was elected king of Hungary after the death of Corvinus in 1490. The Ottomans made regular incursions against southern Hungary during the following years, but they could not capture important fortresses. Hungary and the Ottoman Empire signed a peace treaty in 1503, which was renewed in 1510 and in 1511. After the new Ottoman Sultan, Selim II, started a new war against Hungary in 1512, Pope Leo X authorized Tam√°s Bak√≥cz, Archbishop of Esztergom, to proclaim a crusade against the Ottomans. About 40,000 peasants took up arms against the Ottomans and Bak√≥cz made the Sz√©kely soldier, Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa, the commander of the crusader army on 25 April 1514. After the peasants refused to pay taxes and began plundering the noblemen's manors, Vladislaus, ordered them to disband. D√≥zsa did not obey the king's command and routed the united army of Stephen B√°thory, Isp√°n of Temes, and Nicholas Cs√°ki, Bishop of Csan√°d, at Ap√°tfalva on 23 May. D√≥zsa even had the bishop captured and impaled. The peasants seized Lipova and »òoimo»ô, and laid siege to Timi»ôoara. John Z√°polya, Voivode of Transylvania, came to assist B√°thory who defended the town. Z√°polya defeated the peasants on 15 July and captured D√≥zsa, who was tortured and executed.

It was originally proposed by the Karl Dungs company, and has since been adopted by several other manufacturers. The eBUS interface has also been used by home-automation enthusiasts to connect their domestic solar or heating system to a networked PC for monitoring or remote control.  Physical layer  The eBUS 2-wire interface is an asynchronous serial port with active-low voltage that exchanges 8-bit bytes with start and (single) stop bits (no parity bit), at a symbol rate of 2400 baud, and can be implemented with a standard UART plus a voltage converter. It differs from the RS-232 interface, from which it is derived, in that the voltage levels were chosen to allow the bus also to supply power to bus participants, who can use a voltage stabilizer to derive an internal 5 V supply: * logical 0 = 9‚Äì12 volt * logical 1 = 15‚Äì24 volt (typical: 20 V)  Data-link layer  Bus participants are either \\"masters\\" or \\"slaves\\". Only masters can initiate a command, by issuing a data packet that consists of * 8-bit source address (lower 4 bits: priority class, higher 4 bits: bus master address) * 8-bit destination address (254 unicast destinations, 0xff = broadcast) * 16-bit command code (8 bit primary command byte and 8 bit secondary command byte) * 8-bit data length indicator: 0‚Äì16 (not counting additional bytes inserted by the byte stuffing rule) * 0‚Äì16 data bytes * 8-bit cyclic redundancy check byte (generator: x8+x7+x4+x3+x+1) Recipients acknowledge such a command with a single acknowledge byte 0x00 (received correctly) or 0xff (received incorrectly). Slaves follow their acknowledge byte with a reply of a length byte and 0‚Äì16 data bytes plus CRC, which the receiving master in turn confirms with an acknowledge byte. As the last step of a data exchange, the master finishes a command by sending a synchronization byte SYN (0xaa). This signals to other masters that the bus is available for use again. A byte stuffing rule (0xa9 -> 0xa9 0x00, 0xaa -> 0xa9 0x01) is applied to all other bytes sent, to ensure that 0xaa does not appear on the wire as part of any transmitted data other than in the final synchronization byte. The transmission of a command can only appear immediately after a SYN byte was seen on the bus. If no SYN byte has appeared on the bus for 35 ms, the bus supply transmits one to ensure that there remain transmission opportunities (AUTO-SYN). Each bus master accessing the bus immediately after a SYN has to verify (in their UART's receiver buffer) that the source address byte that they sent has indeed appeared on the bus intact and has not collided with another master's transmission attempt. In the latter case, the transmission must be aborted and a collision-resolution procedure is initiated: at the next AUTO-SYN, participants with a priority class lower than the highest that participated in the last collision must not attempt a retransmission (and wait until the next SYN).  Application layer  The eBUS standard specifies a number of generic protocol packages of use for controlling heating-system components. Some manufacturers have augmented these with their own proprietary extension data packets. Vaillant boilers, for example, use mostly proprietary data packets on their eBUS interface, thereby maintaining compatibility with the implementations of other manufacturers' eBUS implementations mainly at the physical and data-link layers.  Specifications  The eBUS specification documents were between 2001 and 2009 maintained by the eBUS Interest Group led by Prof. Lawrenz at Fachhochschule Braunschweig/Wolfenb√ºttel. They are now available from a German eBus enthusiast website, e.g.: * eBUS specifications ‚Äì physical layer / data-link layer V.1.3.1 (March 2007) * eBUS specifications ‚Äì application layer V1.6.1 (March 2007)  External links  * eBus Wiki ‚Äì German eBus enthusiast website, features recent versions of the official German and English eBUS specifications and associated documents * eBUS Interest Group ‚Äì no longer online * eBUS daemon ‚Äì a C++ based daemon for communication with eBUS heating systems Category:Serial buses ","title":"EBUS (serial buses)"},{"id":"34312256","text":"Joseph Isadore \\"Pat\\" Kilhullen (August 10, 1890 ‚Äì October 25, 1922) was a catcher in Major League Baseball.

Overview Envisioned to be built as the most modern stadium in Central America, funding has fallen short due to embezzlement from Sandinistas and the stadium is being built in stages. As of April 2011, only the first stage is complete thus far. The first stage included building of the playing surface, locker rooms for teams and officials, and a main grandstand. Second and future stages include end zone stands (under construction) as well as a media center and press box. The national Football stadium is sometimes confused with the old National Stadium, Estadio Dennis Martinez in central Managua. That stadium was built in 1948, primarily as a baseball stadium. And it was in fact a stadium used by the national team before the construction of the current stadium.

The museum is affiliated with Fo Guang Shan, one of Taiwan's largest Buddhist organizations. The museum is located next to the Fo Guang Shan Monastery, the headquarters of the order. The museum houses one of the tooth relics of Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of the Buddhist faith. Construction of the museum began in 2008, and the museum was opened to the public in December 2011. The museum was accepted as the youngest member of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in 2014. Since its opening, the Buddha Museum has frequently been featured in the top 10 landmarks of Taiwan on TripAdvisor.https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Landmarks- cTop-g293910#4 Since 2015, the museum has been certified ISO 50001:2011 by the Quality management system. History In 1998 Venerable Master Hsing Yun traveled to Bodh Gaya, India to confer the precepts for full ordination. He was entrusted with a tooth relic by Kunga Dorje Rinpoche who had safeguarded the relic for nearly thirty years. Rinpoche was touched by the efforts of Fo Guang Shan in promoting exchanges between different Buddhist traditions, and he hoped that the relic could be enshrined in Taiwan as a symbol of Dharma preservation. Venerable Master Hsing Yun says, ‚ÄúThe Buddha does not need any anybody‚Äôs worship or reverence, it is living beings that need inspiration to develop wholesome thoughts and purify their minds. By worshipping a memorial, people can come to know the Buddha‚Äôs Dharma body, and their feelings of admiration can be elevated into wanting to learn about the Buddha‚Äôs virtues and practice them in everyday life. The Buddha doesn‚Äôt need a memorial, but living beings do. I built this pagoda with this in mind.‚Äùhttp://www.fgsbmc.org.tw/GauD.aspx?PNO=2016070010 Construction With this belief, the Venerable Master Hsing Yun looked for a suitable piece of land to build the Buddha Museum, which happened to be just behind the Fo Guang Shan. The design of the museum itself went through more than one hundred revisions. Venerable Master Hsing Yun was inspired just before the foundation had been completed, where he used a few bottles of mineral water, a tissue box and some newspapers, and set out a rudimentary layout for the future Buddha Museum.

Together, the unit of observation and the level of analysis help define the population of a research enterprise.  Analytical levels in social science (in ascending order)  Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which social science research may fall: micro level, meso level or middle range, and macro level. Micro level The smallest unit of analysis in the social sciences is an individual in their social setting. At the micro level, also referred to as the local level, the research population typically is an individual in their social setting or a small group of individuals in a particular social context. Examples of micro levels of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following individual analysis type approach: * Alien, stateless person, asylum seeker, refugee * Person * Citizen * Partnership, marriage * Families * Household * Neighborhood Meso level In general, a meso-level analysis indicates a population size that falls between the micro and macro levels, such as a community or an organization. However, meso level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro and macro levels. It is sometimes referred to as mid range, especially in sociology. Examples of meso-level units of analysis include the following: * Clan * Tribe * Community * Village, town, city * Formal organization * State Macro level Macro- level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as economic or other resource transfer interactions over a large population. It is also referred to as the global level. Examples of macro-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following: * Nation * Society * Civilization * International * Global  \\"Level of analysis\\" in cognitive science   Marr's tri-level hypothesis  According to David Marr, information processing systems must be understood at three distinct yet complementary levels of analysis ‚Äì an analysis at one level alone is not sufficient.  Computational  The computational level of analysis identifies what the information processing system does (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and similarly, why does it do these things.  Algorithmic/representational  The algorithmic/representational level of analysis identifies how the information processing system performs its computations, specifically, what representations are used and what processes are employed to build and manipulate the representations.  Physical/implementation  The physical level of analysis identifies how the information processing system is physically realized (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system).  Poggio's learning level  After thirty years of the book Vision (David Marr. 1982. W. H. Freeman and Company), Tomaso Poggio added one higher level beyond the computational level, that is the learning.  \\"Level of analysis\\" in political science  In political science, level of analysis is generally divided into three categories ‚Äì individual, state, and international system. However, newer discussions of globalization have led to a newer level of analysis to be considered. The framework of analysis originated from K. Waltz's 1959 book entitled Man, the State, and War. An examination is J. Singer's \\"The Level-of-Analysis Problem in International Relations\\" (1961).Singer, J. (1961). \\"The Level-of-Analysis Problem in International Relations\\". World Politics, 14(1), 77‚Äì92. While the framework is widely discussed, not many scholarly articles use it. Two writings may shed light on its advantages and disadvantages: M. Brawley's 2005 case studies of international economic relationsBrawley, M. (2005). Power, Money, and Trade: Decisions that Shape Global Economic Relations. Toronto: UTP. and S. Hu's 2015 analysis of small states' diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.Hu, S. (2015). \\"Small State Foreign Policy: The Diplomatic Recognition of Taiwan\\". China: An International Journal, 13(2), 1‚Äì23. The three (or four) levels of analysis cannot describe every effect and there is unlimited number of levels between the three primary ones, levels of analysis will help understand how one force in political power affects another. Generally, power is the concept that collects all the analysis together. For example, the struggle for power may be the cause of war, but the struggle for power may originate in the individual human being's lust for power. The lust for power is individual level of analysis, while the struggle for power is systemic level of analysis. Individual level The individual level of analysis locates the cause of events in individual leaders or the immediate circle of decision makers within a particular country. It focuses on human actors on the world stage identifying the characteristics of human decision making.John T. Rowrke. International Politics on the World Stage, 10th edition. For example, the cause of World War I is from the particular leaders in power at that time. Kaiser Wilhelm II is considered to be the level from which the cause originated. It may have been his need for power to hide a sense of inferiority, or it may have been his inability to understand the intricacies of statecraft, the way Otto von Bismarck did. Or it may have been his idea about the monarchy and German destiny. All three possibilities are drawn from an individual level of analysis. Domestic/state level The domestic level of analysis locates causes in the character of the domestic system of specific states. Thus, war is caused by aggressive or warlike states, not by evil, inept, or misguided people or the structure of power in the international system. The failure of domestic institutions may also cause war. In World War I, the internal collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or the brittle coalition inside Germany of agricultural and industrial interest, such as rye and iron, are often cited as important causes. Domestic level cases may come from various characteristics of the domestic system. Capitalist and socialist economies generate different attitudes and behavior. The Muslim and Christian religions or democratic and nondemocratic political ideologies do as well. Stable and failed institutions are domestic level factors affecting state behavior. A great worry today is the existence of failed states, meaning states whose domestic institutions have broken down, such as Somalia. Another worry here is existence of a rogue state, such as North Korea, which may pass nuclear weapons on to terrorists. Any type of state come from the domestic level of analysis, but a failed state usually means an institutional breakdown at domestic level of analysis, whereas a rogue state often implies evil intentions by individual ‚Äì individual level of analysis. Systemic level The systemic level of analysis explains outcomes from a system wide level that includes all states. It seeks explanations for international phenomena by considering the nature or structure of the international political system at the period under study. It takes into account both the position of states in the international system and their interrelationships. The position of states constitutes the systemic structural level of analysis. This involves the relative distribution of power, such as which state; great, middle, or small power, and geopolitics; such as which state is sea or land power. The interaction of states constitutes the systemic process level of analysis. At this level, we are concerned with which state aligns with which other states and which state negotiates with which other states. Thus, we can explain World War I in terms of the absence of system wide institutions, such as League of Nations, which was not created until after World War I to prevent such wars in the future. However, system wide institution does not always mean harmony among nations, as seen in the World War II. The cause of World War II is seen as the failure of a systemic institution, which led new institutions of the United Nations to carry on reformed legacy of the League of Nations.McGraw Hill. Introduction to International Business, 8th edition. Global level Global level factors are much like Systemic level factors, however the core difference is that global factors are not necessarily created by states, whereas systemic factors are. Global factors can be the outcome of individuals, interest groups, states, nonstate actors or even natural conditions ‚Äì however they cannot be traced to the actions of any one state or even group of states. An example can be how the internet can shape how policy is formed, through social media or forums ‚Äì where an idea is formed over time by a group of individuals, but the source is generally hard to determine. An environmental natural example is how global warming can help shape how society views certain policies, or help shape new policies themselves. Droughts caused by rising temperatures can cause global actors to form alliances to help procure critical resources ‚Äì and as writers such as Peter Gleik and Michael Klare have shown, the possibility of \\"Water Wars\\" in dry countries in Africa and the Middle East are very possible.Oxford University Press.

On 26 May 1833 he married Elizabeth Long who was the granddaughter of the 7th Earl of Northesk. Rolls became High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1842. Rolls and his wife had several children but only one son, John Allan Rolls, who became 1st Baron Llangattock. Rolls' brother Alexander married the actress Helen Barry. Woodblock print of The Hendre Rolls was responsible for extending the size of The Hendre using the services of Thomas Henry Wyatt. His architect created a new open roofed entrance hall for the building and the south wing and the park were improved. In 1877 Wyatt was again employed to add rooms for billiards, dining and smoking, as well as a coach house to replace the demolished old stables. Coat of arms of John Etherington Welch Rolls In 1863 Rolls' long service as a deputy was rewarded when he was made the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons in Monmouthshire. Rolls collected art including sketches by Henry Fuseli and illuminated manuscripts. Some of the sketches are now in the possession of Indiana University and others are in the British Museum. It was proposed that \\"a cattle show\\" should be created in Monmouth, and in 1857 the eighth Duke of Beaufort and Rolls each put money into a thirty-pound fund to start the Monmouth Cattle Show in October of the same year. Rolls was the greater financial contributor and he became President of the show until his death. This cattle show, still in existence, is now known as the Monmouthshire Show. Rolls also served as the President of the charity that ran The Dispensary which provided out-patient and hospital care for the poor people of Monmouth. He gave ¬£1,000 to fund a hospital bed in perpetuity at that establishment. Rolls' daughters, Elizabeth Harcourt, Patty, Anne Katherine and Ellen, all married well; Georgina Emily married Thomas Chester- Master who was a Conservative MPDebretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1881 whilst Rolls' third daughter Mary Octavia Rolls did not marry. After a long illness, Rolls died in 1870, and at All Saints' Church in Llanfrechfa in Monmouthshire a medieval preaching cross was rebuilt in his memory by his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Frank Johnstone Mitchell. He was succeeded by his son John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock.

With the blessings of Lord Shiva, Jagadguru Re·πáukacharya (also known as Reva·πáaradhya or Reva·πáasiddha) was one of the five acharyas who came in the Kali Yuga to teach and preach Virasaivism. He is aforesaid to possess been born from the Somesvara linga, however, to possess traveled everywhere Asian nation to show Virasaivism. The Someshwara temple is located in Kollipaki. Texts date this legendary saint to the time of the Ramaya·πáa since he was the teacher of the nice sage Agastya of Panchavati. This saint is alleged to possess consecrated thirty million li·πágas at the bid of Rava·πáa's brother, Vibhi·π£a·πáa, once Rava·πáa's death. He finally established the Rambhapuri ma·π≠ha. The Re·πáuka gotra of the Virasaivas is known as once him. As mentioned above Shri Revana Siddeshwara was the reincarnation of Great Jagadguru Shri Renukacharya. Thus, with the blessings of Lord Shiva, Renuka emerged from the Somashekhara linga close to Hyderabad's Kolli saakshi kshetra, and have become called Revana Siddeshwara. According to Indian mythology, the lord preached ‚ÄúPatsala lingaanga saamarasya tatwat‚Äù to Agastya Maharshi. He also visited Sri Lanka as per Vibhishana's advice to King Ravana, he installed three crores of shivalingas. In this approach he even convinced many kings and emperors across Indian States to unfold shivabhakti. Revana Siddeshwara, throughout his Mission Shivabhakti campaign, once lived on a mountain at Averahalli near Ramanagara in Karnataka. That place is even currently called a holy shivakshetra [Shiva place]. Finally once he was in kolli saakshi kshetra once more, as per lord Shiva's wish, he became lingaikya and reached Kailasa, the abode of Lord Shiva. The place wherever he did anushthaana in Avarehalli is understood as Revanasiddeshwara Betta (hill).https://www.dham-yatra.com/revana-siddeshwara-swamy-temple-48 References Category:Hindu temples in Ramanagara district Category:Shiva temples in Karnataka ","title":"Revanasiddeshwara betta"},{"id":"34312588","text":"Doinall Dhu O'Connor (1894-1975) or Dan, was a New Zealand theatrical manager, concert impresario and businessman.

Early life Orange was born on 9 August 1889 in Woolston, Christchurch, New Zealand, the second of eleven children of Albert Edward Orange, a wool-classer, and his wife, Helen Brenda Hinkley, a nurse. He grew up in Christchurch, where he attended Christchurch Normal School, and then in Kaikoura. Career After an unhappy time working in shops and serving briefly in the army at Featherston, Orange studied for the ministry at Canterbury College. He completed his studies and was ordained priest in 1923, was acting vicar of Fendalton (1923‚Äì1924) and then in 1924 vicar of Waikari. He developed an increasingly fundamentalist, evangelical theology. Orange was vicar of Sumner from 1930 to 1946, working with Sumner School for Deaf Children and expanding the Evangelical Union at Canterbury College, as well as the Crusader Movement of New Zealand, Scripture Union and the Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions. It was during this time that he became a leader of the Evangelical movement in New Zealand. In 1946 he was appointed the first warden of an evangelical conference centre, Tyndale House. He left the following year after disagreement with its founder. He went to ChristChurch Cathedral as acting precentor and took that role in 1949. He was an honorary canon of the cathedral from 1951. For the six years from 1954 to 1960, he was chaplain of Cathedral Grammar School, which is closely connected to the cathedral. Later life Upon his retirement in 1963, he became the first warden of Latimer House, then a new evangelical library and study centre connected to College House at the University of Canterbury, which had just moved from the Christchurch Central City to the suburb of Ilam. He died at Christchurch on 28 June 1966, leaving his sermon manuscripts and most of his library's 15,000 volumes to Latimer House.

History Alumni football has been around for decades. While there have been a few high schools that have done an alumni football game, there have been several companies that have come and gone attempting to do alumni football games as a business. The first and only one that is still in business, Alumni Football USA, did their first game in 1985, and have done over 1300 games as of November 2016. Current popularity Starting in 2008, Alumni Football USA began spreading Alumni football games across the United States. Since then Alumni Football USA has done over 1000 Alumni football games in 30 states, raising almost $3,000,000 for schools and charities across the country. Types of alumni football There are usually two different types of alumni football. There is flag football and full contact football. Values of the game Alumni football is a modern-day revival of sorts. It has a value far beyond the game itself. It allows for players to reconnect with their football roots and brings teammates across the decades together on one team. Communities are brought together through this fun and exciting venue. Much needed funds are raised for specific needs of each unique community. Legal issues There is some legal discussion on whether schools are able to issue school gear to non-students. There are two main issues at debate. # Does a school's insurance cover non-student adults playing in a sport on behalf of the school? # In order to disperse equipment to adults that was meant for students, what safety precautions need to be taken in order to protect the student and the adult? # Who is governing these safety issues? All equipment needs to be NOCSAE certified before it goes on the body of a student. If it is used after certification by an adult, it could be damaged and be unsafe for use on a student. This damage may not be visible to the eye. That is why reconditioning companies (with NOCSAE Certification) have special machines to test the safety of equipment.Stanton, Karin. \\"Alumni Football Games Light up Kealakehe Hawaii 24/7.\\" Hawaii 24/7.

Early life At the age of six Osborne moved with her parents and 12 siblings to Great Barrier Island, about to the north-east of Auckland. Osborne's parents began cattle farming at Rosalie Bay in the south of the island. Growing up in such an isolated location was challenging, but Osborne's mother Emilie recognised artistic talents in her daughter at an early stage. She married Joe Osborne in 1874; they settled at Tryphena at the southern end of Great Barrier Island and commenced raising a family of 13 children.  Career  As Osborne did not date her paintings it is not known when she commenced painting the indigenous plants of Great Barrier Island. However, over a period of some decades her work reached the highest quality and is now greatly appreciated from both artistic and scientific points of view. Her paintings of the Adams mistletoe (Trilepidia adamsii) are particularly important as this species is now considered extinct, and no colour photographs of it exist. A collection of her paintings of Great Barrier Island plants was published in 1983 by Jeanne Goulding of the Auckland Museum, whose botany department holds the largest collection of Osborne's works.

Alexander Paterson O'Shea (29 December 1902 ‚Äì 24 December 1990) was a New Zealand shepherd, clerk, farmers‚Äô union leader, political lobbyist and meat industry representative. He was also a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Biography Early life He was born in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand in 1902 to John O‚ÄôShea, a law clerk, and his wife, Alice Marion Clark. He attended Otago Boys' High School where he excelled and initially intended to pursue a legal career. However, in 1918 he suffered a bout of pneumonia and for a better chance of his health recovering he went to work in agriculture instead. He later moved to Wellington and in 1928 he began part-time study at Victoria University, graduating in 1936 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He married Vera Isabell Cooper (an arts student) on 12 February 1935; they had one daughter together. Union activities O‚ÄôShea became dominion secretary of the New Zealand Farmers‚Äô Union in September 1935. O‚ÄôShea immediately began a strong recruitment campaign, making regular personal visits to all the provinces, encouraging them to join and strengthen their finances. He always believed in free-trade ideals, arguing that protectionist measures and import licensing worked against New Zealand's agricultural trade. From 1964 to 1968 he took up a new position with the New Zealand Meat Producers‚Äô Board, as their marketing representative for North America. In the 1962 New Year Honours, O'Shea was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, in recognition of his services as general secretary of Federated Farmers of New Zealand. Political involvement He was appointed as a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council in 1950 by Prime Minister Sidney Holland as part of the suicide squad selected by the First National Government to vote for the abolition of the Council. Most of the new members (like O‚ÄôShea) were appointed on 22 June 1950, and served until 31 December 1950 when the Council was abolished. O'Shea later became the President of the Wellington Citizens' Association, a right wing local body electoral ticket and was elected to the Wellington Hospital Board. He stood as their candidate for the Wellington Mayoralty in 1971, but lost to Labour's Frank Kitts.

He previously served nine years of a 10-year sentence on charges of \\"creating unease in the public mind\\" before being released in February of 2018. Student activism Nabavi studied engineering at Noshirvani University of Technology in Babol, where he served on its Central Council of the Islamic Association. In 2007, he was permanently banned from university study for his political activities. Along with other banned students, he formed the Council to Defend the Right to Education to defend their rights to continue attending university. In June 2009, Nabavi attended one of the \\"Green Revolution\\" protests, which disputed the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. Shortly after, he was arrested at his home along with his cousin , Atefeh Nabavi. He was initially charged with ‚Äúgathering and colluding against national security‚Äù; ‚Äúpropaganda against the system‚Äù; ‚Äúdisturbing public order‚Äù; and ‚Äúmoharebeh‚Äù (enmity against God), as well as accused with being a member of the People‚Äôs Mojahedin Organization of Iran, a banned militant group. The charges were later reduced to \\"creating unease in the public mind\\", and he was given a sentence of 15 years in prison and 74 lashes. In May 2010, a successful appeal reduced his sentence to ten years. Imprisonment Following his trial, Nabavi began serving his sentence at Tehran's Evin Prison along with numerous other student protesters, including Majid Tavakoli and Kouhyar Goudarzi. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran published a letter from Nabavi in February 2010 in which he stated that he had been held for 100 days of solitary confinement and \\"subjected to physical and psychological torture\\". In July and August 2010, he joined sixteen other prisoners in a hunger strike to protest Evin's conditions after their families were allegedly assaulted by guards during a visiting day on 26 July. By February 2011, he had been moved to Karoun Prison in Ahvaz, but on 24 February was abruptly withdrawn from the prison, causing Amnesty International to issue an \\"Urgent Action\\" that he was at risk for torture. Amnesty International has declared Nabavi a prisoner of conscience and called for his unconditional release. Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian government \\"to release the dozens of students who remain in prison on baseless charges, and allow back into the classroom the hundreds of others who are being deprived of their education for political and religious reasons.\\" References Category:1983 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Iran Category:Iranian activists Category:Iranian prisoners and detainees Category:Living people ","title":"Sayed Ziaoddin Nabavi"},{"id":"34312899","text":"Wings of Life (known as Pollen in France and Hidden Beauty: A Love Story That Feeds the Earth in the United Kingdom) is a 2011 French-American nature documentary film directed by Louis Schwartzberg and released by Disneynature.

Bourguibism is defined by a strong commitment to national independence and a specifically Tunisian nationalism (as opposed to pan-Maghrebi or pan-Arabic ideas, given that Tunisia would only have played a minor role in a potential pan-Arabic project which would likely have been dominated by Egypt), a state capitalist approach on economic development, welfare state, a statist and corporatist interpretation of populism, strict secularism, and cultural modernity, advocating Tunisia's place as a bridge between Arab-Islamic and Western civilisation. Bourguibism is responsible for Tunisia's comparatively high divorce rates, which is one of the highest in the Arab and Islamic World and relatively late age for women to get married (the average age for a women is 35 years which is much higher compared to most other Arab countries). The women of Tunisia are more sexually liberated unlike their neighboring countries as well as the women have a relatively strong role in economy, society and labour (all of which are comparable to the West). While Bourguibists condemned Tunisians who had collaborated with the French colonial rulers, they did not repress the strong European cultural influence on Tunisia and French continued to be the language of higher education and elite culture. Bourguibism is sometimes described as a variety of Kemalism but with focus on the Tunisian identity. Bourguibism is also responsible for Tunisia‚Äôs relatively relaxed drinking culture which is comparable to Western Europe (for example, drinking alcohol is relatively common among the urban population, both among men and women, and is slightly increasing in rural areas as well). As a political style or strategy, Bourguibism is characterised by intransigence in pursuing certain goals and non-negotiable principles combined with flexibility in negotiations and readiness to compromise considering the means to effectuate them. It is therefore described as pragmatic, non- ideological, moderate, and reformist rather than revolutionary, but determined and relentless at the same time. For example, despite being decidedly secularist, Bourguiba made sure to curtail the public role of Islam only carefully and gradually, in order not to arouse opposition from conservative Muslims.

The News Letter. 2 March 2011. \\"The money doesn't matter\\". Mid Ulster Mail. 9 September 2009. took place on 17 January 1992 at a rural crossroads between Omagh and Cookstown in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. A roadside bomb destroyed a van carrying 14 construction workers who had been repairing a British Army base in Omagh. Eight of the men were killed and the rest were wounded. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility, saying that the workers were killed because they were \\"collaborating\\" with the \\"forces of occupation\\". As all of those killed were Protestant, some interpreted the bombing as a sectarian attack against their community. On 5 February, the Ulster loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) retaliated by shooting dead five Catholics at a betting shop in an Irish nationalist area of Belfast. Background Since the beginning of its campaign in 1969, the Provisional IRA had launched frequent attacks on British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) bases in Northern Ireland. In August 1985 it began targeting civilians who offered services to the security forces, particularly those employed by the security forces to maintain and repair its bases. The first to be killed was Seamus McAvoy (46), a Catholic who was shot dead at his home in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, for selling portable buildings to the RUC.Chronology of the Conflict: August 1985, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) In October 1990, the IRA launched three \\"proxy bomb\\" attacks. Three men, who worked for the security forces, were tied into cars loaded with explosives and ordered to drive to British Army checkpoints while their families were held at gunpoint. The bombs were then remotely detonated. Six soldiers and one of the forced drivers were killed in the first two attacks.Chronology of the Conflict: October 1990, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) A third proxy bomb was driven to Lisanelly British Army base in Omagh, but the main bomb failed to explode.English, Richard (2005). Armed struggle: the history of the IRA. Oxford University Press, p. 126. An earlier attack had taken place on this barracks in January, when an IRA bomb damaged the perimeter fence.O'Brien, p. 201 Between August 1985 and January 1992, the IRA killed 23 people who had been working for (or offering services to) the security forces.O'Brien, Brendan. The Long War: The IRA and Sinn F√©in (second edition). Syracuse University Press, 1999. pp.219‚Äì221 The IRA also alleged that some of those targeted had links with Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. Bombing On the evening of 17 January 1992, the 14 construction workers left work at Lisanelly British Army base in Omagh. They were employees of Karl Construction, based in Antrim. They travelled eastward in a Ford Transit van towards Cookstown. When the van reached the rural Teebane Crossroads, just after 5PM, IRA volunteers detonated a roadside bomb containing an estimated of home-made explosives in two plastic barrels.Peter Brooke statement in the House of Commons 20 January 1992 Later estimates report a device.Elliot, Sydney and Flackes, Williams (1999). Northern Ireland: a political directory, 1968‚Äì1999. Blackstaff Press, p.465. The blast was heard from at least ten miles away. It ripped through one side of the van, instantly killing the row of passengers seated there. The vehicle's upper part was torn asunder, and its momentum kept it tumbling along the road for 30 yards.David McKittrick, David McVea. Making Sense of The Troubles. Penguin UK, 2001. p.262 Some of the bodies of the dead and injured were blown into the adjacent field and ditch. IRA volunteers had detonated the bomb from about 100 yards away using a command wire.\\"7 workers killed by bomb in Ulster\\". The New York Times. 18 January 1992.

They were William Gary Bleeks (25), Cecil James Caldwell (37), Robert Dunseath (25), David Harkness (23), John Richard McConnell (38), Nigel McKee (22) and Robert Irons (61). The van's driver, Oswald Gilchrist (44), died of his wounds in hospital four days later.Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) Robert Dunseath was a British soldier serving with the Royal Irish Rangers.\\"Roll of Honour of the Royal Irish Rangers\\", The Royal Irish Rangers 27th (Inniskilling) 83rd & 87th Homepage.

Transaction Publishers, 1997. p.629 two of them were members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). It was the highest death toll from one incident in Northern Ireland since 1988. The IRA's Tyrone Brigade claimed responsibility for the bombing shortly after. It argued that the men were legitimate targets because they were \\"collaborators engaged in rebuilding Lisanelly barracks\\" and vowed that attacks on \\"collaborators\\" would continue. The IRA's statement said: > The IRA reiterates its long-standing call to those who continue to provide > services or materials to the forces of occupation to desist immediately. > Since 1985 the IRA has adopted a policy of taking military action aimed at > ending Britain's cynical use of non-military personnel for the servicing and > maintenance of British Crown Forces' bases and installations ‚Ä¶ for our part, > we in the IRA will not tolerate a situation where military personnel are > freed from essential services and maintenance tasks and then deployed where > they can carry out wholesale repression within our community.English, > Richard. Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA. Pan Macmillan, 2008. pp. > 276‚Äì277 Aftermath Both unionist and Irish nationalist politicians condemned the attack. Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams, however, described the bombing as \\"a horrific reminder of the failure of British policy in Ireland\\". He added that it highlighted \\"the urgent need for an inclusive dialogue which can create a genuine peace process\\". British Prime Minister John Major visited Northern Ireland within days and promised more troops, pledging that the IRA would not change government policy.

Less than three weeks later, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) launched a 'retaliation' for the bombing. At 2PM on 5 February, two masked men armed with an automatic rifle and revolver entered Sean Graham's betting shop on Ormeau Road, Belfast.Wood, Ian S. Crimes of Loyalty: A history of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. p.159 The shop was in an Irish nationalist/republican area and was packed with customers at the time. The men fired indiscriminately at the customers, killing five Irish Catholic civilians, before fleeing to a getaway car. The UDA claimed responsibility using the covername \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\", ending its statement with \\"Remember Teebane\\".\\"4 Catholics are killed by gunmen in Belfast\\". The New York Times. 6 February 1992. After the shootings, a cousin of one of those killed at Teebane visited the betting shop. He said: \\"I just don't know what to say but I know one thing ‚Äì this is the best thing that's happened for the Provos [Provisional IRA] in this area in years. This is the best recruitment campaign they could wish for\\". The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) conducted an investigation into the bombing and released its report to the families of the victims. It found that the IRA unit had initially planned to carry out the attack on the morning of 17 January as the workers made their way to work but, due to fog, it was put off until the afternoon. Although suspects were rounded up and there were arrests in the wake of the attack, nobody has ever been charged or convicted of the bombing. Survivor Bobby O'Neill, who received serious injuries in the blast, told the RUC that as he lay injured on the ground, he had seen a \\"bearded man\\" appear at the scene of the bombing. The man dispassionately walked through the van's wreckage, showing no compassion or emotion as he gazed upon each of the bodies of the dead and injured and making no attempt to help the wounded. O'Neill believed this man was one of the bombers and the following month, helped the RUC to compile a photo-fit image of him which was then circulated to all RUC divisions, but never released to the public.\\"Mystery of 'The Bearded Man'\\".

The museum features a growing permanent collection and is home to traveling exhibitions. In addition, it features a research library, an education wing, a rooftop sculpture collection, and community meeting space. History In July 1981, members of the community of San Angelo came together with the goal of creating a museum of fine arts and established a nonprofit organization for this purpose. After sufficient funds were raised, the museum opened in the renovated former Quartermaster Building at historic Fort Concho in San Angelo. The museum opened in the spring of 1985 and was home to traveling exhibitions from the National Portrait Gallery, the Library of Congress, and the Dallas Museum of Art. In 1994, the decision was made to build a new dedicated building for the museum. Over $7.2 million were raised for its construction and the new facility opened on the banks of the Concho River in September, 1999. The museum has won many awards, including the National Award for Museum Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in 2003. In 2005, the museum gained accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums. The museum now averages around 90,000 visitors a year. The permanent collection holds 277 items focusing primarily on Texas artists. Facilities The San Angelo Museum of Fine Arts is directly across the Concho River from downtown San Angelo and adjacent to the city's River Front concert stage. A winding pedestrian bridge connects the museum to the other side of the river and the parks that run alongside it. The building was designed by the architecture firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The controversial design features a curved roof designed to resemble a saddle or Conestoga wagon and uses an eclectic mix of local materials including limestone and end-grain Texas mesquite. The building features and two main gallery areas with 45-ft and 35-ft ceilings. It also includes two smaller galleries, a rooftop terrace that serves as a sculpture garden overlooking the river and downtown San Angelo, a research library, an education wing and office, and support space. The museum has purchased a block of once- dilapidated buildings and renovated them into gallery space, which it rents out to artists and a new Water Education Center which is operated jointly by the museum and Upper Colorado River Authority.

Japanese forces landed on Rabaul on 23 February 1942, capturing it in February of that year. The former Australian territory was transformed into a major Japanese naval and air installation. The Japanese heavily relied on it, and used it as a launching point for Japanese reinforcements to New Guinea and Guadalcanal. Throughout the Solomons Campaign, neutralizing Rabaul became the primary objective of the Allied effort in the Solomons. Background After its capture by the South Sea Force in January 1942, Rabaul was developed into a major fleet base by the Japanese, eventually becoming the most heavily defended Japanese position in the South Pacific.Gamble, Fortress Rabaul: The Battle for the Southwest Pacific, January 1942 ‚Äì April 1943, pp. 63‚Äì67 Rabaul's strategic location, multiple airfields and large natural harbor made it the ideal staging base for ships, aircraft, troops and supplies during the New Guinea and Guadalcanal campaigns. The Japanese army dug many kilometers of tunnels as shelter from Allied air attacks. They also expanded the facilities by constructing army barracks and support structures. By 1943 there were about 110,000 Japanese troops based in Rabaul. After the Japanese lost their hold on Guadalcanal in early 1943, Allied forces began the push up the Solomon Islands towards Rabaul. Marine Raiders and United States Army troops landed in the Russell Islands shortly after, and an airbase was established there. US forces then pushed the Japanese out of the New Georgia island group in August 1943. Here, the Japanese command had invested men and supplies into building an airfield at Munda, all of which proved to be a waste. The United States Fifth Air Force aircraft made small attacks in October, and a major Allied air raid on Rabaul took place on 3 November. This raid destroyed 52 Japanese aircraft and five warships. Most of Japan's warships would then be withdrawn on 6 November. Starting on 1 November, US Marines began landed at Cape Torokina, on Bougainville, where several airfields were constructed by Allied forces.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 296, 361‚Äì362 With the major Japanese possessions around Rabaul captured, Allied air forces could then begin the permanent neutralization of Rabaul. And as part of efforts to isolate the Rabaul base, US Army troops landed at Arawe on Western New Britain on 15 December, and the 1st Marine Division landed at Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 373‚Äì389 Early air attacks As the major Japanese fleet base in the South Pacific Rabaul had been under continuous Allied air attack since the first raid by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Catalinas in January 1942.Gamble, p. 55 However a lack of resources and the enormous distances involved (Rabaul was 500 miles from the nearest RAAF airfield at Port Moresby) ensured that these attacks remained small and sporadic for nearly two years. October ‚Äì November bombing raids As a part of Operation Cartwheel the U.S. Fifth Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), all under the command of General George Kenney, began a sustained bombing campaign against the airfields and port of Rabaul in late 1943. The initial mission was delivered by 349 aircraft on 12 October 1943, but it could not be followed up immediately due to bad weather. A single raid by 50 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers reached the target on 18 October. Sustained attacks resumed on 23 October, culminating in a large raid on 2 November. After the first Japanese attempt to repel the Allied amphibious invasion of Bougainville was thwarted by the United States Navy surface forces at the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, the Imperial Japanese Navy sent a large naval force from Truk to Rabaul for a second attempt.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 323 Lacking a comparable surface force of his own, Admiral William Halsey responded by ordering Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman to launch a dawn attack on the Japanese fleet at Rabaul using the airgroups of the aircraft carriers and , followed up an hour later by a Fifth Air Force raid of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. These attacks succeeded in damaging six of the seven Japanese cruisers present in Simpson Harbour, ending the Japanese threat to the Bougainville landings. A following raid on 11 November including the three carriers of Task Group 50.3 commanded by Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery inflicted additional damage on the light cruiser and shot down 35 Japanese aircraft. The pacification campaign begins A US Marine TBF Avenger crew prepares for another mission over Rabaul The capture of Bougainville and Buka brought Rabaul within range of land-based US Navy and Marine Corps tactical bombers, setting the stage for the pacification campaign to follow. Rather than attempt to capture the heavily fortified position, the Allies determined to neutralize Rabaul by isolating it and eliminating its airpower. The first air attack in the pacification campaign was planned for 17 December 1943. It would be based out of Torokina Airfield on Bougainville, and consisted of thirty-one Marine F4U Corsairs, twenty-three RNZAF P-40 fighters, twenty-two US Navy F6F Hellcats, and a slightly smaller number of Army Air Forces B-24 bombers. The attack did not receive a large response from the Japanese, so only seven Japanese fighters were lost. Three RNZAF P-40s were lost, two with their pilots. A similar attack took place on 19 December, which cost the Japanese four aircraft, two credited to Marine fighters. The first \\"large scale\\" strike took place on 23 December. Different from previous strikes, the Army Air Forces bombers went in first, and the fighters followed afterwards. Forty Japanese fighters responded this time, with thirty claimed to be destroyed by Allied fighters, though Japanese records do not match the Allied claims. Following another raid on Christmas Eve, US Navy carriers attacked the Japanese force at Kavieng, New Ireland in unison with an air raid on Rabaul. The Navy carriers would return to Kavieng on 1 January 1944. January became a busy month for Allied aircraft. Throughout the month, the Japanese command devoted valuable carrier aircraft and carrier pilots to the defense of Rabaul. The seemingly hopeless situation in which the Japanese pilots were being fed into was nicknamed \\"the sinkhole in the Bismarcks.\\" January proved costly for the Japanese: 266 fighters were credited to US Marine Corps fighters and bomber gunners alone, not including the physical damage done to Rabaul's land defenses. In February, the Japanese command decided to pull all remaining Japanese airmen and their crews from Rabaul. Between 70 and 120 Japanese aircraft flew from Rabaul to Truk (which had recently been raided by US Navy carrier aircraft) on the morning of 19 February. Their valuable mechanics attempted to leave Rabaul by ship on 21 February, but their ship, the Kokai Maru, was sunk by Allied bombers. This marked the end of Japanese air resistance to Allied planes over Rabaul. Aftermath With Rabaul's offensive capabilities neutralized, the Allies decided to forgo a ground assault, electing instead to reinforce their foothold on the southern coast of New Britain against any potential Japanese counter-attack while allowing the Rabaul garrison to \\"wither on the vine.\\" Allied fighters and bombers continued to attack Rabaul through 1944 and 1945. The regular attacks became known as \\"milk runs\\" among the Allied air crews. The only opposition over Rabaul was anti-aircraft fire, so attacking became a normalcy for Allied airmen and their maintenance crews. Eventually Allied forces came to use Rabaul as a live-fire exercise to give aircrew some taste of combat before committing them elsewhere in the theater. The neutralization of Rabaul was ultimately a disaster for the Japanese. Most of their experienced carrier pilots were lost over Rabaul, large numbers of their sorely needed aviation maintenance personnel were either lost during their attempted evacuation or trapped there, and the Japanese no longer had a base from which they could threaten the Allied presence in the Solomons. By isolating Rabaul, the Allies effectively made its large garrison (which outnumbered the defenders on Okinawa) prisoners of war without having to fight them. The last Allied airstrike on Rabaul took place on 8 August 1945, only weeks before the Japanese surrender.

History In July 1944, the Rockefellers began planning a new 16-story tower to house the Standard Oil Company (Esso), which had outgrown its lease at the nearby 30 Rockefeller Plaza.Landmark Designation New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, 1985. The structure was completed in 1947 in early Modernist style. It was originally known as the Esso Building. At completion, the building was the tallest completely air-conditioned building in New York City, and the first in Rockefeller Center. The building also housed Schrafft's Restaurant which had a capacity of 1,283 people, making it the largest restaurant in the world at the time. Standard Oil's successor, Exxon, moved to the newly built 1251 Avenue of the Americas in 1971. In 1973, the heating, ventilation and air‚Äêconditioning systems in the building were replaced, along with some upgrades to the electrical systems. After these renovations, Warner Communications (later Time Warner) leased all of Exxon's former space, which led to the building becoming known as the Warner Communications Building. Warner initially occupied only of space and subleased the rest to tenants including the Financial Times, Thomson-CSF, PBS, and The Economist. In December 1996, a fire at the TGI Fridays on the basement of the building led to a minor explosion in a top-floor equipment room, causing the building to be evacuated. In 2012, Time Warner indicated that they would not be renewing their space in the building due to their move to Time Warner Center, which would leave the building virtually empty in 2014. After Time Warner vacated the space, Rockefeller Center's owners brought in RXR Realty by a $500 million, 99-year lease to manage the building's office space. As part of the deal, RXR would spend $250 million to renovate the building in a plan designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. The renovation included a new lobby, replacement of the elevator cabs, new mechanical, electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, and a complete fa√ßade restoration. Following the renovation, RXR secured Merrill Lynch Wealth Management as the anchor tenant in June 2016 with a lease. The American Girl Store also signed a 2-story, lease to relocate its flagship store from nearby Fifth Avenue. In August 2017, Austrian bank Erste Group signed a lease in the building for their New York outpost.

Some historians of medicine suggest that the modern medical scientific principle \\"Contraria contrariis curantur\\" (opposite cures the opposite) dates back to ancient Kolkhs and their healer and sorceress princess Medea, acquiring its final form in the classical Greek and eventually in the modern medicine.Ramaz Shengelia: Study of the History of Medicine in Georgia, p.2 Georgian popular tradition even attributes the origins of the term Medicine solely to Medea's name. In fact, the term likely stems from the Indo-European root MA and MAD, ‚Äúand its more familiar hypothetical form MED, meaning to think or to reflect, to give a consideration or care to‚Äù. Still, a possible relation between the name of Medea and the term Medicine cannot be decisively denied.Thelma Charen: ‚ÄúThe Etymology of Medicine‚Äù, Bull Med Libr Assoc. 1951 July; 39(3): 216‚Äì221. History \\"Karabadini\\" - the 15th-century Georgian medical Almanac by Zaza Panaskerteli-Tsitsishvili Beginning of the recorded history of Georgian traditional medicine should be related to the first almanac of medical remedies and medical knowledge written in the 11th century, known as ‚ÄúUstsoro Karabadini‚Äù (Georgian: ·É£·É°·É¨·Éù·É†·Éù ·Éô·Éê·É†·Éê·Éë·Éê·Éì·Éò·Éú·Éò).Karabadini (Georgian: ·Éô·Éê·É†·Éê·Éë·Éê·Éì·Éò·Éú·Éò):ka:·Éô·Éê·É†·Éê·Éë·Éê·Éì·Éò·Éú·Éò.

Russian. The highly developed feudal social structure of Medieval Georgia led to the emergence of traditional Georgian medical families (not too unlike the better known Irish medical families), one of which, the Turmanidze family (Georgian: ·Éó·É£·É†·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éò·É´·Éî·Éî·Éë·Éò) is first mentioned in historical documents somewhere on the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. So great was the clout of the bearers of Turmanidze family traditions even in the twentieth century that some representatives of the family who lacked any formal education were nevertheless granted medical licenses by the Soviet officials, who were generally very adamant about disallowing traditional medicine methods in the official Soviet medicine.Turmanidze medical family (Georgian: ·Éó·É£·É†·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éò·É´·Éî·Éî·Éë·Éò):ka:·Éó·É£·É†·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éò·É´·Éî·Éî·Éë·Éò.

Produced during Catmull's tenure at the University of Utah, the short was created for a graduate course project. After creating a model of his left hand, 350 triangles and polygons were drawn in ink on its surface. The model was digitized from the data and laboriously animated in a three-dimensional animation program that Catmull wrote. The hand animation consists of three sequences, all rotating. The first is the data output of the hand (now called vertices) connected by lines (now called edges) but not filled with faces. The second is a halftone sequence that shows flat shading but lacks smooth shading. The final, completed animation, with organic smooth shading of the surface between the data points, depicts the hand swiveling, opening and closing, pointing at the viewer, and tilting back so the camera can move to the inside of the hand. The clip also features computer animations of an artificial heart valve and human faces. Snippets of the animations were used in the 1976 Hollywood science fiction film Futureworld. The short film has been called groundbreaking and revolutionary for being one of the earliest examples of computer animation. Catmull went on to become a co-founder of Pixar and then its president and president of Walt Disney Animation Studios. In 2011, the film was inducted into the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Library of Congress scholars wrote: \\"In creating the film, Catmull worked out concepts that would become the foundation for computer graphics that followed.\\" Production Catmull hoped as a child to become a Disney animator but reversed his ideas in high school, ruefully concluding he lacked the ability to draw. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1969 with a degree in computer science and physics, taking a job at Boeing shortly afterward. His position was soon terminated in a mass layoff along with thousands of other employees. Catmull revised his idea of becoming an animator during this time, believing computers might allow him to animate.Price, p. 13 Fred Parke, a fellow Ph.D. student in his class who helped produce the film, recalled that computer animation was \\"sort of on the lunatic fringe at that time. [‚Ä¶] People were just barely to the point where they could get a computer to put out still images.\\" It was obvious it would take years for the state of the art in computer hardware to catch up with this ambition, and there were multiple problems on the mathematical and programming side. Nevertheless, in 1972, Catmull took the opportunity to create the short animated clip for a graduate course project. Catmull used his left hand as the basis for the clip, first creating a model of it. He began making a plaster- of-paris mold of his hand and accidentally pulled off the hair on the back of his hand while removing the mold. He then made a plaster model from the mold and drew 350 small triangles and polygons on the model in ink. Digital counterparts of these polygons would represent the surface of his hand in the computer.Price, p. 14 Catmull and Parke spent much time crafting the film, measuring the coordinates of each of the corner points of the polygons and typed them into the machine with a Teletype keyboard. With a 3-D animation program Catmull wrote, they could reproduce the disembodied hand on a screen and make it move. During this time, Parke had created a computer animation of his wife's face as well, which is seen in the film. Transferring the images to film was a task in itself. Because the display hardware never showed the entire image on screen at any one moment, Catmull could see a frame of his work only by taking a long-exposure Polaroid of the screen and looking at the snapshot. Once satisfied, he then shot the footage using a 35mm camera the department rigged to take photographs from a CRT screen. The film credits fellow student Bob Ingebresten for creating the 3-D titles. Legacy In this sequence in the film, the viewer sees a digitized human hand composed of lines. Professor Ivan Sutherland opened a line of communication with The Walt Disney Company to see whether Disney could be persuaded to use computer graphics in its production process for traditional animation. Sutherland brought Catmull to Disney to meet with executives, but Disney management was not interested in computer graphics at that time. Instead, they invited Catmull (to no avail) to help the Disney Imagineering team use computers to design a new ride - specifically, Space Mountain, a roller-coaster ride planned for the new Walt Disney World complex in Orlando, Florida.Price, p. 15 The clips were later used on a TV monitor in the 1976 science-fiction thriller Futureworld, about a futuristic theme park where androids are programmed to grant every guest‚Äôs wish. Catmull would later go on to form his own Computer Graphics Lab, later contacted by George Lucas of Lucasfilm to bring computer graphics into the entertainment field. The Graphics Group, one third of the computer division at Lucasfilm, was later purchased in 1986 by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs, and it was renamed Pixar.Price, p. 7 Pixar produced the world's first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, in 1995, and has since become the world's dominant animation studio, producing a string of immensely commercially and critically successful films.Price, p. 5 Catmull has won four Academy Awards for his technical feats and helped create some of the key computer-generated imagery software animators rely on today. The film has been labeled a landmark, being called revolutionary in both the art of animation and film. Craig Caldwell, senior research professor at the University of Utah, stated in 2011 that the film is groundbreaking because \\"it showed the potential of putting three-dimensional form in the computer.\\" In 2011, the film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry, dubbed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Notes See also * List of American films of 1972 References * External links *A Computer Animated Hand essay by Andrew Utterson at National Film Registry *A Computer Animated Hand on Vimeo * Category:1971 films Category:1971 animated films Category:1970s American animated films Category:1970s animated short films Category:American animated short films Category:American films Category:Computer-animated short films Category:Student films Category:United States National Film Registry films ","title":"A Computer Animated Hand"},{"id":"34313580","text":"Abbotstown is a townland in the civil parish of Castleknock in Fingal, Ireland.Placenames Database of Ireland - Abbotstown townland It is also the name of an historical demesne and country estate that is close to Blanchardstown.

It was built in 1938-1939 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1992, as part of the Nebraska Post Offices Which Contain Section Artwork MPS. Description The Crawford US Post Office is located at the northwest corner on 2nd and Main Streets in the commercial district of Crawford, Nebraska. It was built in the Moderne style in the late 1930s from standardized blueprints. Included in the listing are three contributing objects: two ornamental lampposts flanking the staircase to the main entrance and a flagpole. The structure has one story with a basement and measures approximately . It is constructed of red brick with a concrete base and topped by a limestone parapet. The main entrance features an aluminum grill with a stylized eagle above the doorway. Two recessed windows with limestone sills are located on each side of the entrance. Although they were originally triple-hung, the upper thirds have been filled in with wooden panels. The architectural features of the front facade are echoed on the remaining sides of the structure. A handicap ramp has been added on the structure's west side, and an enclosed stairwell on the east side provides access to the basement. Crawford Post Office lobby, looking east Inside, the lobby features original marble floors and wainscoting, radiators, and woodwork. The space immediately inside the front entrance is surrounded by a vestibule that projects into the lobby. The building's original light fixtures have been replaced since the original construction, as have the front doors. The lobby's most prominent feature is a mural on the upper portion of the east wall. It was painted by G. Glenn Newell, an artist and dairy farmer from Dutchess County, New York, and installed by post office workers in May 1940. The piece depicts a wagon train beginning to ford a stream. The lead wagon dominates the scene with other wagons visible in the background, along with local landmark Crow Butte. History The first area post office was established in June 1884. It was located four and one-half miles (about seven kilometers) south of what is now Crawford, and was known as the Crow Butte/Sioux County branch. After Dawes County was formed from the western portion of Sioux County, the post office's name and site changed to Crawford. It became a second-class branch on July 1, 1912. City delivery was established on July 1, 1930. After being located in many different locations in town, it moved to the current building, which was built in 1938-1939 and dedicated during the community's 1939 Labor Day celebration. The edifice's mural, titled \\"The Crossing\\" and painted by G. Glenn Newell, was one of hundreds commissioned by the Section of Fine Arts in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Newell received a notice from the section inviting him to submit designs for the Crawford Post Office in August 1939. Newell immediately accepted the commission, for which he would be paid $800. Although he did not visit Crawford before painting the mural, he received several photographs from the Crawford postmaster to aid him in accurately painting the setting. Newell originally conceived the idea of including a poem with the mural, which read, \\"Seeking the westward sunshine/ Leaving storms behind/ Taking sires of the future with them/ And dams of a better kind.\\" He was informed this was unnecessary. The completed mural was shipped to Crawford in April 1940. It was professionally cleaned and restored in 1981. The Crawford postmasters have included John Walsh, Cyrus Fairchild, Lee Van Voorhis, C.W. Fritts, George C. Scott, John Pat Davis, John Lemons, Edwin Gorton, Frank Reeves, and Mary Jo Knoell.

At an apparent visual magnitude of 3.41, Epsilon Lupi can be readily viewed from the southern hemisphere with sufficiently dark skies. It is the fifth-brightest star or star system in the constellation. Parallax measurements give a distance to this system of roughly . This system is what astronomers term a double-lined spectroscopic binary. When the spectrum is examined, the absorption line features of both stars can be viewed. As a result of the Doppler effect, these lines shift back and forth in frequency as the two stars orbit around each other. This allows some of their orbital elements to be deduced, even though the individual stars have not been resolved with a telescope. The pair share a close, elliptical orbit with a period of 4.55970 days. The orbital eccentricity is 0.277, which means that at the separation at closest approach, or periapsis, is only 57% of the distance at their greatest separation, or apoapsis. There is a third, more distant companion at an angular separation of around 1 arcsecond that may be orbiting the pair with a period of about 64 years. The pair that share the close orbit, Epsilon Lupi Aa and Epsilon Lupi Ab, have estimated masses of 13.24 and 11.46 times the mass of the Sun, respectively. The more distant component, Epsilon Lupi B, has a mass of about 7.64 times the Sun. The combined stellar classification of the system is B2 IV-V, while the individual components may have spectral classes of B3 IV, B3 V, and A5 V, in order of decreasing mass. The inner A-a pair appear to have their rate of spin synchronized with their orbit, so that the same face of each star always faces its partner. The secondary, Epsilon Lupi a, shows regular variation in luminosity of the type that occurs with Beta Cephei variables, at a periodicity of 10.36 cycles per day. This star system is a probable member of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a moving group of stars that originated together and share a similar trajectory through space.

It is the 53rd Lantz Oswald and the 106th overall. Plot One night, Oswald is reading to three kittens the story of Little Red Riding Hood. After reading his book, he falls to sleep in his bed. Oswald then dreams of the live female stuffed doll (his second girlfriend in the series) being like the title character of the story he just read: walking through the woods in a red hood and carrying a basket. He even dreams of himself in the scene, accompanying her. On the way, they met a large wolf who desperately wants a share of the goods in the doll's basket. The doll, however, declines and tells the wolf that what's inside was for her grandmother. The wolf was disgusted and thinks of a way to obtain the contents. As Oswald and the doll go on walking, the wolf decided to reach the grandmother's home before them which is part of his plan. The wolf invades the house and harasses the old lady before putting her in a freezer. He then disguises himself in a nightgown and tucks himself in the bed. When the two little friends finally arrived at the house, the doll proceeds to the bedroom while Oswald stays near door. While the rabbit waits, a rat came to and tells him to open the freezer. Oswald opens it and was shocked to find the real grandmother trapped in a block of ice. At the bedroom, the doll eventually realizes who she's speaking to and begins to make her run as the wolf aggressively goes forth. In no time, the wolf got his hands on the doll and takes her basket which he finds a magic wand inside. Before Oswald could intervene, he magically sends the rabbit into a skyscraper area, dangling on two clotheslines. The wolf then teleports Oswald onto an elevated railway with an incoming train, then into the mouth of a whale, and finally in a shooting gallery with firing shooters. He and the doll (still in his grasp) were in every place Oswald was transported to, but at safer locations. Finding his way out of the shooters' gunfire, Oswald was able to take the wand, and teleports everybody back to the grandmother's place. When they returned to the house, the wolf, for some reason, was lying on a table unconscious. Oswald then uses the wand to transform their tormentor into a large roasted turkey. The grandmother, who is finally defrosted, came to the dining room and decides to have a meal of what's on the table. For a job well done, Oswald and the doll kissed each other. Morning came and Oswald wakes up from his dream. He was, however, surprised to see that what he had been kissing was a cow which sticks its head in the window.

() is a 1974 Italian comedy film, directed by Marcello Fondato and starring the comedy team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.http://www.impawards.com/1976/watch_out_were_mad.htmlhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/mobile/m/watch_out_were_mad/ It is an international co-production between Italy and Spain. Plot Somewhere in Spain, off-road race car driver Ben (Spencer) is anticipating the next rallycross race, because of the prize‚Äîa red Puma dune buggy with a yellow top. However, he does not count on \\"The Kid\\" (Hill) entering the competition, who also has a talent for the sport‚Äîand an eye on that same dune buggy. During the race, each man battles furiously to the finish line. But in a surprise finish, they both end up tying for first place, and dash for the buggy, reaching it at the same time. As a result, they are both awarded the dune buggy. Of course, sharing is out of the question, so they soon get into a serious discussion as who gets the buggy, at first suggesting betting it in a game of cards, and arm-wrestling. Finally they decide on a \\"beer and hot-dog\\" duel in the funfair's pub, in which \\"the first one that gives up loses the car and pays the tab\\". The challenge is roughly interrupted by men working for \\"The Boss\\" (Sharp), a building profiteer that wants to demolish Luna Park so he can replace it with a skyscraper, who proceed to tear up the beerhouse and threaten the customers. Ben and Kid agree to take their contest elsewhere, but when ordered by one of them to leave the car under the threat of destroying it, Ben and Kid dismiss him and drive away, which results in the buggy being rammed by another car, wrecking it. Resolute to reclaim a new buggy, the two barge into the Boss' restaurant during a dance party, and demand that he replaces the buggy, otherwise they'll \\"get mad\\". After the two leave, the boss is inclined to buy them a new buggy to compensate them, but is discouraged by the \\"Doctor\\" (Pleasence), a German-born Freudian psychologist: he believes that Ben and Kid are two \\"spoiled children\\" that think the boss is the \\"father figure\\". To give in to their demand would be a bad psychological fallout. The Doctor exalts the Boss' wickedness, goading him into dealing with the two, and the Boss sends his henchman Attila after them, spraying gasoline onto Ben's car and lighting it aflame, though they're able to put it out by driving into a nearby car wash. Feeling that he didn't get their point, Kid moves on to persuade the Boss to give them the dune buggy, with Ben reluctantly tagging along, partially due to him wanting to study his part for the choir. The first attempt ends with an all-out brawl in the fairgrounds' gym, where the two beat up Attila and his henchmen, which in turn infuriates the Boss enough to send a motorcycle gang after them. After a chase scene through a nearby forest area and the motorcycle gang being disposed of, the Doctor persuades the Boss to send Paganini, a highly skilled assassin from the Chicago Underworld, after them. The assassin confronts the two, although both manage to evade his attempts, with Kid luring him away from Ben's place and to the auditorium where the choir Ben is a part of is in. This culminates in a confrontation right in the middle of the repetition of the choir, which eventually results in Ben getting kicked out, despite the assassin himself being caught by Kid and forced at gunpoint to play in the Boss' restaurant. Infuriated, the Boss is about to use his trademark punishment where he stabs his fork into the hands of his henchmen on the Doctor, only for him to suggest to target Jeremiah, Ben's assistant and a former cook who worked for the Boss, instead, insisting that he is the mastermind behind their actions. After Ben sends Kid away from having him kicked out of the choir, he finds Jeremiah beaten up and injured in his garage, who mentions he was attacked by the Boss's men. Angered, he heads directly to the boss' restaurant to confront him, where the Kid meets up with him. After being turned away by the doorman, Ben and Kid force their way into the restaurant using Ben's car and demolish it as they drive through inside, after which they have a massive brawl against Boss' henchmen. In the end, the Boss finally has had enough and presents Ben and Kid with not one, but two of the dune buggies they had been wanting, one for each of them. But as they have fun with the buggies, the Kid gets distracted by the female employee of the funfair he had taken interest in, resulting in him crashing and destroying Ben's buggy. As Ben watches the burning wreckage, Kid sits next to him, and the pair talk over what to do to decide who gets the remaining buggy.

It was immediately rehoisted but the pilots refused to fly, saying that they would reconsider their position later. Weather conditions did not improve, and the start was postponed. The weather did not clear until 26 June. Brussels-Roubaix Nine pilots started the stage on 28 June, Weyman having withdrawn from the race in order to take part in the Gordon Bennett Trophy race.

Warren and his second wife, Clara LaBarron Morgan, bought the house in April 1910, and their dining room received such guests as Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. The Senator died in 1929, and Clara gave the mansion to the YWCA. The house and its dependencies compose one of the few residences from the 1800s left standing in Cheyenne. In 1960 the outer stone, which had been predicted back in 1880 to be too soft, began to crumble and the exterior was covered in stucco. Don and Barbara Sullivan began living there with their children in 1985, when they bought the residence. Jim Osterfoss bought it in 1997, restored it, and turned it into the B&B; that it now is. The stone carriage house, originally a stable for four horses, was later used as an automobile garage and during the YWCA years as an entertainment center. The original stone smokehouse also still stands, making a total of three buildings on the property, though the carriage and main houses are now connected. The residence was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1976.

It originally aired on April 1, 2010. The episode was written by Bryan Oh and Andrew Chambliss and directed by Kevin Bray. Plot The episode starts with the vampires who got out of the tomb trying to adjust to the modern way of living at the house in the woods where they are gathered by Pearl (Kelly Hu) and Anna (Malese Jow). Pearl and Anna have to leave to go into town and leave Frederick (Stephen Martines) in charge. Frederick though wants to leave the house and not stay any longer locked in. Pearl enforces order and then she leaves with Anna. Frederick though sneaks out of the house with another vampire named Bethanne (Jeni Perillo) a little later. Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Elena (Nina Dobrev) talk about having fun for only one day without any vampires. Caroline (Candice Accola) approaches them and asks them to go out on a double day the four of them; Elena, Stefan, Caroline and Matt (Zach Roerig). Elena hesitates to accept but Stefan convinces her that it will be fun. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) comes home and finds Pearl and Anna wait for him. He tries to choke Pearl but she is older and stronger than him. Pearl tells him that the trapped vampires escaped from the tomb and that she needs his help. Damon denies even though Pearl promises she will find Katherine for him and Pearl hurts him telling him that she is not asking. Matt suggests his mother Kelly (Melinda Clarke) to try get a job as bartender at the Grill and she agrees to give it a try. She goes to the bar but she is stood up for the interview when Damon comes and sits next to her. A little later Jenna (Sara Canning) gets into the bar and the three of them start drinking together having fun. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) searches in the Internet information about vampires when the doorbell rings and it is Anna. Jeremy looks surprised since he thinks that Anna left with her mother. The two of them talk and Jeremy opens a subject about vampires saying that maybe they do exist and some of them might be misunderstood. Anna looks upset and tries to throw him off. The four of the double date get at the Grill and start playing pool. They spot Jenna, Kelly and Damon at the bar drinking and Matt and Elena start talking about old stories and them being knowing each other since kids, something that makes Caroline feel awkward. She leaves for the restroom asking Elena to go with her. Caroline lets Elena know that she does not like what is happening and Elena apologizes. Elena, on her way back to the pool, is seen by Frederick who is at the Grill and grabs her calling her Katherine. Elena says that he is mistaken and goes to Stefan. She writes Stefan a text message to let him know but when Stefan tries to spot the man, is already gone. The four of them leave and go to the Salvatore house to continue their double date. Matt sees Stefan's miniature car collection and gets excited, so Stefan shows him his sport car and let him take it for a ride with Caroline. Meanwhile, a drunk Jenna exits Grill to go home as Damon and Kelly flirt. She runs into Frederick who tries to compel her but it does not work. He asks about Damon, who he saw her with in the bar, and Jenna tells him where he lives before she leaves. Back at the Salvatore house, the four teenagers get back inside to find Kelly and Damon making out. Kelly walks out ashamed and Matt goes with her while Damon does not look bothered. Elena offers to drive Caroline home while Frederick spies the Salvatore house from afar. At the Gilbert house, Jeremy and Anna make sandwiches while Jeremy cuts his hand in purpose since he is suspecting Anna to be a vampire. Anna cannot resist and reveals to Jeremy that she is a vampire by drinking from him. Jenna returns home right on time to make Anna stop. Jeremy greets Jenna and by the time he searches for Anna, she is gone. Pearl catches Anna return home late and demands to know where she was. Anna does not tell her about Jeremy but that she was just out for a walk. Stefan tries to lecture Damon when Frederick and Bethanne jump through the window and attack Stefan. Damon pulls Frederick off Stefan and all four of them start struggling. Stefan kills Bethanne and Frederick flees when he sees he has lost his partner. Stefan is shocked because he recognizes them as vampires who were sealed in the tomb while Damon is less surprised since he already knew that the spell did not work. Frederick returns to Pearl's without Bethanne and he admits she was right and they should not leave the house. She lets him back in but teaches him a lesson by stabbing him in the gut with a wooden spoon. The episode ends with Jeremy finding Anna at his room upset asking him why he did what he did and that she could kill him. Jeremy says that he put all the signs together in hope that it is true that vampires exist, so it would be true for Vicky (Kayla Ewell) as well. Jeremy tells Anna that he want her to turn him.

It rises 80 metres above the adjacent south Canberra suburbs of Lyons, Curtin and Weston, and its 66 hectares (163 acres) is one of 33 areas which form Canberra Nature Reserve. The highest point of the hill, 684 metres above sea level, is marked by a survey station. The hill‚Äôs name is thought to come from the stands of she oaks (casuarinas, Allocasuarina verticillata) growing on the hill, mainly on the eastern side.Graeme Barrow \\"Walking Canberra‚Äôs Hills and Rivers\\" Dagraja Press 1997 About half of Oakey Hill is open space with a mix of native and exotic grasses, while the remainder is bushland with stands of native eucalypts including yellow box and Blakely‚Äôs red gum. A number of walking tracks circle or cross the hill. The walking tracks are popular with day walkers and they also see some cycle and equestrian traffic. The walks are generally rated as easy with some short steep climbs. The views from the summit are impressive: east to Red Hill and Isaacs Ridge, north to Scrivener Dam and Mt Painter and the Belconnen hills, northeast beyond the Captain Cook memorial water jet towards Mount Ainslie and Mount Majura, and west over Cooleman Ridge to the Brindabellas. History For many years, the northern Canberra region, including Oakey Hill, was home to the Ngunnawal Aboriginal people.Josephine Flood \\"Moth Hunters of the Australian Capital Territory: Aboriginal traditional life in the Canberra region\\" 1996 More recent European history includes references to Oakey Hill being included in Woden Valley farming leases which allowed stock to graze on the hill and adjacent lands.Marion Douglas and Fionna Douglas \\"Not without my corsets! : oral histories of the families who farmed soldier settler blocks in the Woden Valley from 1920 to 1963\\" 1996 With the development of nearby suburbs in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the grazing leases were terminated. A water reservoir was established near the top of the hill, power lines were erected on the lower slopes, and more recently a mobile telephone tower was erected near the reservoir. Canberra Nature Park, including Oakey Hill, was gazetted in 1993. In January 2003, bushfires swept in from the western side and about 80 percent of the hill was burned. While the fire damaged or destroyed many of the hill‚Äôs trees, it also stimulated growth, particularly of eucalypts and casuarinas, and parts of the lower slopes are now heavily timbered. Wildlife The grasslands and timbered slopes provide habitat for a large number of small to medium-sized birds common to the Canberra region. Boobook owls, kookaburras and king quail are frequently sighted. The rocks and grass provide a home for lizards and snakes including brown snakes, bluetongue lizards, native gecko (eastern stone gecko or wood gecko - Diplodactylus vittatus) and the threatened pink tailed worm lizard (Aprasia parapulchella). Scorpions and huntsman spiders also hunt among the rocks and fallen bark in the treed areas. Oakey Hill has a resident population of eastern grey kangaroos and provides a corridor for fauna travelling through the Canberra Nature Reserve. Brush tailed possums are frequent visitors to residential gardens adjacent to the hill. The hill is also home to introduced species, including red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), hares and Indian Mynahs. Geology and geography Oakey Hill is elongated in a north-northwest direction. This is parallel with the general direction of the nearby Murrumbidgee River. A low ridge extends southwards to Mt Taylor (856 metres above sea level) and this separates the Woden Valley from Weston Creek. The rocks on Oakey Hill are remnants of volcano activity in the Middle Silurian period and are part of the Deakin Volcanics, the series of lava flows that cover much of the southern half of Canberra. Examples of the acid volcanic rocks of the Deakin Volcanics can be seen in the road cutting along the Tuggeranong Parkway between Hindmarsh Drive and Cotter Road. There are areas of porphyry which have intruded into the volcanic rocks and these also are Middle Silurian in age.D. M. Finlayson \\"A Geological Guide to Canberra Region and Namadgi National Park\\" Geological Society of Australia (ACT Division) 2008 Park care While Oakey Hill has been a green reserve since the 1960s, it formally became part of the larger Canberra Nature Park with a gazettal in 1993. Following the Canberra bushfires of 2003, the ACT Government began an ambitious fuel reduction program on the hill to remove the remaining stands of Tasmanian blue gum which is not endemic to the ACT. This galvanised local residents who, together with Environment ACT rangers, explored options for ongoing practical conservation work.John Butcher \\"The Scribbly Gum\\" ACT Parks and Conservation Service Spring 2009 A parkcare group was formed and initially it worked according to a plan developed by the Parks, Conservation and Lands (PCL) Branch of the ACT Government, targeting areas of high conservation value. Over time, as the hill has recovered from the fires, the group itself has determined its work program in consultation with rangers. The parkcare group‚Äôs principal focus is on helping the hill to heal itself by reducing the competition of introduced and exotic species, thereby allowing endemic species to flourish. Since the bushfires, many fire-adapted species such as casuarina (Allocasuarina verticillata) and the native black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri) have recovered strongly. Native grasses ‚Äì such as kangaroo grass, wallaby grass and lomandra - and a wide variety of shrubs have also made a comeback and are now competing with introduced species. In the main, the parkcare group undertakes weed control, focussing on introduced species such as Cootamundra wattle, Tasmanian blue gum, firethorn, cotoneaster, briar rose and assorted woody weeds. Although the group has undertaken some planting of wildflowers, grasses and trees, drought conditions prevented any significant planting. The group also undertakes repair and maintenance of formal and informal walking tracks, weather and materials permitting. Since it began in December 2003, the group has held monthly working bees on the third Sunday of each month (except January and February) to improve the site.

It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. It is unusual in that it was once connected to lines with three different gauges. Location  The station is located at the end of Nibelungenstra√üe in the Wuppertal district of Ronsdorf about 1.2 kilometres east of its centre at an altitude of 295 metres above sea level. Since the 1970s, it has been connected to the residential area of Rehsiepen, located east of the station, by a pedestrian bridge over the station's tracks. History  During the construction of the Rittershausen‚ÄìRemscheid line, a route was originally considered that would have run further west through Erbschl√∂ and closer to central Ronsdorf. Topographic conditions led to the current route finally being selected; this runs through the hamlet of Blombach to the site of the station and continues along the Tannenbaumer Weg towards L√ºttringhausen, Lennep and Remscheid. The station was opened at the same time as the line to Remscheid on 1 September 1868. The Ronsdorf-M√ºngsten Railway  The Ronsdorf-M√ºngsten Railway (, RME) was built from 1890 as a metre gauge line to improve links with Ronsdorf and numerous metalworking companies in the Morsbach valley. The section from Stadtbahnhof (\\"City station\\"), which was adjacent to Wuppertal-Ronsdorf station, to Ronsdorf station was inaugurated on 28 May 1891. As early as 21 August 1891 the RME was extended to Clarenbach and on 16 November 1891 it was completed to M√ºngsten. The line was electrified in 1903. It was closed in stages up until 1959. Stadtbahnhof was renamed as Wuppertal-Ronsdorf station in 1949. Three gauges  In addition to the standard-gauge state railway and the metre-gauge RME, a narrow-gauge light railway network was built on the immediately adjacent brickyard site. The brickyard tracks are long gone. Today the site is used for the workshops of the cable manufacturer Draka. The escarpment of the pit used for the extraction of the raw material for brick making is still easily recognised. Current situation  Der M√ºngstener in the station The austere entrance building that was built in the 1960s, replacing the original 19th century building, no longer has any rail functions, but only houses a kiosk. During the reconstruction of the station in 2006‚Äì2007, the central platform was raised to 76 cm and the station entrance was made accessible for the disabled by means of a ramp and a lift, or alternatively via stairs. Both the old platform roof with its cast iron columns and the old underpass to the former station building have disappeared. The freight yard building is used as a warehouse and the freight hall of the RME, which was also built of timber construction, is still preserved. The loading dock, like the former home platform of the passenger station, has been abandoned for several years. East of the platforms tracks, there are two other tracks, only occasionally used as through-tracks, which are sometimes used for the parking of freight vehicles. The switches and signals are controlled from the interlocking at Remscheid. The remaining sidings, such as to the factory premises of the Draka company, are used only occasionally. On the site of the former transfer station to the RME (in the southern part of the station area) there is now a scrap metal recycler. The station is served by line S7 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn (Der M√ºngstener), which operates at 20-minute intervals, Mondays to Fridays, and every half-hour on weekends. The station is also served by city bus line 620 towards Ronsdorf-Markt/Elberfeld and Klausen/L√ºttringhausen.

Early life and education Born in Loup City, Nebraska in 1903, Talbot received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the State University of Iowa. Career Initially a teacher, Talbot joined E. I. du Pont as a research chemist. He was then a research chemist for A. D. Little. He was later the technical director of the Sun Chemical Company (formerly the General Printing Ink Company) and president of its Fine Chemicals Division. While on leave from Sun in 1944, he was the assistant director of research and development for the Office of Strategic Services. During his career, he developed melamine resin, a type of plastic used for molding and casting. Talbot held several patents. Unofficially appointed in September 1946 and officially appointed in January 1947, he was SRI International's first director. He helped establish the organization and set its early priorities. Due to a dispute with Stanford University president Donald Tresidder, he offered his resignation and reluctantly left SRI in December 1947. Talbot believed SRI should seek contracts from governmental organizations (and be what is now considered a defense contractor); Tressider believed the organization should be independent from government interference. Talbot went on to work for the Rubberset Company and later on for Bristol Myers. He died in 1967.

It aired on V. The series premiered on August 31, 2009. The show doesn't currently air new episodes. The series is an adaptation of the American original Wipeout. Unlike the original version which is a one-hour episode, the Quebec version is divided into three 30-minute episodes, issued during the week to \\"increase the suspense\\". Concept Two hundred participants were chosen by Quebec production among the 18,500 entries received to participate in the course of Wipeout and only 200 people were chosen to play the game. In each episode, 24 Quebecois candidates participating in Wipeout and through several tests. There is only one winner per episode, who would. Course Each episode, 24 participants from French-speaking Canada undergo a series of obstacle courses, and those who manage to make it past the round. The Scanner The twelve remaining candidates are perched on poles in a circle about four feet in height. A horizontal motorized bar starts rotating, passing over the poles. The candidates must jump to avoid it, and test continues, the more the bar rotates faster and it rises. A candidate has the right to grab the pole if it is unbalanced, but he/she must stand up on the pole before the bar does not switch back to its level. The final six contestants standing make it to the next round, but the test continues until there is only one candidate remaining. The Wipeout Zone First, applicants must go down a slide, a length of 45 feet before reaching the pool. Second, they must reach a slope where they have to go over rolling drums of 50 kg . Then they must pass through the \\"wall of rain\\", where participants have to make their way to the other end of the narrow ledge, with small rocks fixated on the adjacent wall for contestants to grip on, as gallons of water flow down the wall, impeding the contestants' balance. The candidate then must jump on a turnstile consisting of giant poles arranged around a wheel, in which the candidate must hold. On the other side is a small platform on which to jump to continue. Then contestants must make their way to the beam, a beam that turns around on itself. If the candidate is dropped, he/she must go on the platform again and repeat the process, but the beam does not turn. Finally, the candidate must jump on two trampolines, the second being located higher than the first. The candidate must push a button on the final platform to stop the timer. The candidate who finishes the course in the shortest amount of time will be declared the champion of Quebec's Wipeout.

After Amy Winehouse's untimely death, on 23 July 2011 from alcohol poisoning at the age of 27, the foundation was set up by Winehouse's family and launched on 14 September 2011 (which would have been Winehouse's 28th birthday). Its aim is to help vulnerable or disadvantaged young people and it works with other charitable organisations to provide frontline support. Its central office is in North London, but it also has an office in New York (operating under the name 'The Amy Winehouse Foundation US'). Jon Snow, Mark Ronson and Barbara Windsor are patrons for the charity, and ambassadors include Keira Chaplin and Mica Paris. Focus The Foundation‚Äôs work focuses on three core areas: # To inform and educate young people about the effects of drug and alcohol misuse, as well as to support those seeking help for their problems and those needing on-going support in their recovery #To provide support for those most vulnerable, including those who are disadvantaged through circumstance or at high risk of substance misuse. #To support the personal development of disadvantaged young people through music. The Foundation was established with royalties from the sales of 2011's Lioness: Hidden Treasures album (with ¬£1 per album going to the charity), and also the sales of Amy - My Daughter, a biography of Winehouse written by her father, Mitch Winehouse. As of 2012/13, the charity relies on donations from the general public and fundraising events to continue its work. Such events include the auction of the iconic polka dot chiffon dress worn by Winehouse on the cover of her critically acclaimed second album Back to Black - with a winning bid of ¬£36,000 GBP. The Amy Winehouse Resilience Programme On 12 March 2013, the Foundation launched the Amy Winehouse Foundation Resilience Programme For Schools with the help of ex-addict Russell Brand. The programme aims to provide effective education around drugs, alcohol and dealing with emotional issues to secondary schools across the UK. On 4 June 2013, the Mayor of Camden Town, Jonathan Simpson, wrote an article for the Huffington Post in support of the programme. Amy's Yard One of the Amy Winehouse Foundations‚Äô main areas of focus is ‚Äòto support the personal development of disadvantaged young people through music‚Äô. Since the Foundation began we have met countless young people with immense talent who are simply held back by not being able to access professional studio time due to the costs and lack of provision. The Foundation therefore decided to develop Amy‚Äôs very own studio and share it with some of the young people from the partner organisations we work with. On 14 September 2015 (which would have been Winehouse's 32nd birthday), the Amy Winehouse Foundation released their first album Amy's Yard - The Sessions: Volume 1 in partnership with Island Records. The album features tracks completed by young artists who have been involved within \\"Amy's Yard Programme\\". Patrons *Barbara Windsor *Jon Snow *Mark Ronson *Nas *Monte Lipman Events Since its launch on 14 September 2011, the Amy Winehouse Foundation have done a series of events on every birthday of Amy Winehouse. In 2013 (when it would have been Winehouse's 30th birthday), the charity widely celebrated the birthday by doing an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in Camden Town, creating a shop that was for a limited amount of time, named Amy's Pop- Up Shop in Camden Town, a picture gallery entitled as For You I Was A Flame at the Proud Gallery and various performances took place from people involved with the foundation. In 2014, a Statue of Amy Winehouse was unveiled at Stables Market in Camden Town, done by Scott Eaton. Winehouse's parents Mitch & Janis were in attendance for the event, as well as Winehouse's friend, Barbara Windsor. In 2015, an album was released on Winehouse's birthday, entitled as Amy's Yard - The Sessions: Volume 1. The project sees young people with a musical talent mentored to become self-sustaining music artists. They are given time in Amy's own studio and are guided by producer Urban Monk who has worked with the likes of Giggs, Wiley, Plan B, Ghetts, Lily Allen and Mr Hudson.

The film starred Philip Michael Thomas as a plumber turned musical artist who got hooked on angel dust, leading to a drastic change in personality and, soon, his demise. Plot The film begins with a news anchor reporting on a crazy man, suspected to be high on angel dust, attacking a group of roller skaters at a park in Venice, California; the man was apprehended by police and handcuffed, but broke free of the handcuffs and escaped, only to get hit by an automobile and die of his injuries. Then entering the scene is Jesse Thomas (Philip Michael Thomas), a plumber with a desire to be a successful singer and musician. Jesse was living a decent life with his fianc√©e (Vernee Watson- Johnson) until one day, he was accepted into a music conservatory and, later, a recording contract with Crown Records. To celebrate, Jesse and his fianc√©e go to a night club; performing at the club was The Gap Band, who perform several numbers and even let Jesse play keyboard. At one point, Jesse went to the restroom where he was accosted by a drug dealer (Frankie Crocker), who gave Jesse a free sample of \\"whack\\", a cigarette laced with angel dust. At the table, Jesse took a few puffs of the cigarette, leading to a hallucination of a moving painting on an otherwise-blank wall. Convinced of the magic cigarette's powers, he became hooked on angel dust, making regular visits with his drug dealer to get more of the stuff. All the while, his musical career continued, resulting with an album that won a Grammy and went double platinum. However, the effects of angel dust has more and more complicated his life, leading to objects that magically turn into strange creatures (such as a hairbrush turning into a baby alligator), hallucinations that has interrupted his recording sessions, and paranoia of his friends and loved ones turning against him. Later on, Jesse visits a local nursing home, where he visits a wheelchair-bound man that he identified as his father. Jesse talks about his success and becomes very saddened about it, especially after noticing that his father is non-responsive of the news, other than saying, \\"I have no son\\", in a nod to The Jazz Singer. Jesse and his now-wife later shop at a supermarket; while there, Jesse began to experience severe hallucinations, ranging from rats in a pile of oranges, to shoppers and employees turning into zombies and ogres, to spiders magically appearing on Jesse's arm. Scared and mentally tormented, Jesse leaves the store through the back onto a street, running towards a moving delivery truck, thinking that it was alive. The driver, not seeing Jesse until the last second, struck him, killing him on the scene. The accident was followed by special news bulletin by Larry McCormick, announcing the death of Jesse Thomas. McCormick then interviews an executive with Crown Records, who talked about Jesse's accomplishments, then later admitting that they should have done something about his addiction when they first suspected that there was a problem.

Her career covered seven decades, and her main areas of interest were landscapes, portraits, still lifes and nudes.  Early life  Page was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1899, the youngest of seven children of Mary Renshaw and John Polson. Her father was accountant and then manager of Suckling Brothers shoe company. Her parents encouraged her and her sisters to learn music and painting from an early age; in fact, Page could read both words and music, and was able to draw, before starting school.  Education  In 1906, Page started primary school at Sydenham School. She initially wanted to follow in her father's footsteps and learn book-keeping, and asked to be sent to Christchurch Technical College, however she didn't enjoy the experience. Instead, when she was 15, she enrolled at Canterbury College School of Art as a junior pupil. She quickly progressed from elementary to advanced classes, under her teachers Cecil Kelly, Leonard Booth, Archibald Nicoll and Richard Wallwork. She received a number of prizes while at the school, as well as first class honours in her examinations. While at art school, Page began lifelong friendships with a number of literary and artistic local women, including writer Ngaio Marsh and fellow artist Viola Macmillan Brown. Page was also taught by fellow Canterbury artist Margaret Stoddart.  Career  In 1922, Page was elected to the Canterbury Society of Arts, which enabled her to begin working as a professional artist, exhibiting and selling portraits and landscape works around New Zealand. In 1927, Page was a founding member of a group of Canterbury artists who became known simply as The Group. These were artists who were interested in breaking with the traditions of the art world, and wanted to start a modernist movement. From 1930 to 1936, Page was a teacher at the Canterbury College School of Art. During this time she taught Bill Sutton, who went on to become a well-known artist. In 1933 she was a foundation member of the New Zealand Society of Artists.  Influences  A number of overseas trips influenced Page's work. In 1936 she travelled to Europe where she visited the Tate Gallery of portraits in London and was impressed by the French Post Impressionists. She started to use pure colour after this trip. Some years later, Page began to admire the work of Kokoschka and in 1956-1957 she travelled to Salzburg, Austria, to attend a Kokoschka summer school.  Recognition  In 1983, Page was made a Fellow of the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, and was also the first artist to hold the Governor-General's Art Award. In the 1987 New Year Honours, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to art.  Personal life  Page married pianist Frederick Page in 1938 in Governors Bay, near Christchurch, and they rented a country house there for the next seven years before moving to Wellington. They had two children, a son (Sebastian, born 1939) and a daughter (Anna, born 1942). Her husband died suddenly in 1983, and Page died in 1988 in Wellington.

Seven people were killed in the explosion, including two members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who said they had evacuated people to what was considered to have been a safe area following misleading telephone calls, which had originally placed the device in a nearby street. They asserted that when the last call finally identified Donegall Street as the site of the bomb, there wasn't enough time to clear the street. The Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade admitted responsibility for the bomb, which also injured 148 people, but claimed that the security forces had deliberately misrepresented the warnings in order to maximise the casualties. This was one of the first car bombs the IRA used in their armed campaign.  The bombing   Warning telephone calls  On Monday 20 March 1972, at 11.45 a.m., a local carpet dealer received a telephone call with a warning that a bomb would explode in Belfast city centre's Church Street which was crowded with shoppers, office workers on lunch breaks, and schoolchildren. British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The second call to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final call came at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived too late for the security forces to clear the street. The staff working inside the News Letter were told by the caller that they had 15 minutes in which to leave the building, but they never had a chance to evacuate.

Republican Labour Party leader Paddy Kennedy promised that any Protestant backlash against Catholics \\"would be met by a counter-backlash by the Irish people\\". According to Ed Moloney, the bombing was considered a disaster for the IRA. Coming so soon after the horrific Abercorn Restaurant bombing which had killed two young Catholic women and maimed many others, the Donegall Street bombing caused them to lose considerable support from the Catholic and Nationalist community who recoiled from the carnage the bombing had wrought.Moloney, Ed (2010).

The blast caused considerable damage to two trains, parked vehicles, the hotel, and other buildings in the area.\\"70 injured in explosion near Belfast hotel\\".

Clubhouse of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club at Hunter Quay History The Royal Northern was originally based in Rothesay but moved to the current clubhouse in Rhu on the Gare Loch in 1937. The Royal Clyde vacated its premises at Hunters Quay in the fifties and also moved to Rhu before the two clubs merged in 1978 to form the Royal Northern & Clyde Yacht Club. The Royal Northern Yacht Club is believed to have been one of the first British yachting clubs to receive a royal charter, in 1830. The club was founded to organise and encourage the sport, and by 1825 Scottish and Irish clubs were racing against each other on the Clyde. However, yachting and yacht building didn't really take off until the middle of the 19th century. The Clyde Model Yacht Club was inaugurated in 1856, receiving its royal charter in 1863, and the two clubs dominated the Scottish yachting scene at that time.

The prayer requests divine providence for the State of Israel and its leaders, and that the exiled Jewish people be gathered in to the Land of Israel.  History  The prayer was instituted in 1948 by the Sephardic and Ashkenazic Chief Rabbis of the newly formed State of Israel, respectively Rabbis Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. The prayer was originally published in the newspaper HaTzofe on September 20, 1948, and in Haaretz on the following day. Over the years it was assumed that Nobel laureate S. Y. Agnon was the one who actually composed the prayer, but researcher Yoel Rappel showed that Agnon was only asked to assist in composing it. This was confirmed by Agnon's son Hemdat. The prayer was written as a replacement for the Prayer for the Welfare of the Government, which was commonly said in Diaspora communities. That prayer included requests for the welfare of the government of the country of residence, the King, Caesar, or Tzar and/or heir to the throne and their immediate family. The recommendation to say such a prayer is found in Pirkei Avot 3:2. At times when there have been ill relations between the Religious Zionist community and the government of Israel, particularly during the period between the signing of the Oslo Accords until the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, as well as during the disengagement from Gaza, some refrained from reciting this prayer, or inserted changes which expressed their outrage at the State's leadership. One of the most common changes was to replace the words \\"...and send Your Light and Your Truth to its leaders, its officers and advisers, and set them aright with Your good counsel\\" with \\"stand at its head men of valor, God-fearers, men of truth who hate avarice, and send Your Light and Your Truth upon them.\\"  Liturgy  In the prayer, the State of Israel is called \\"the beginning of the emergence of our redemption.\\" This phrase, and reservations about the secular governance of Israel, are some of the reasons why Haredi Jews in the main do not say this prayer. In practice, the recitation of this prayer, and to a lesser extent the Prayer for the Welfare of the Soldiers of the IDF, has become one of the differences delineating the Haredim from the Religious Zionists. Ashkenazi Jews recite the prayer between the recitation of the haftarah and the returning of the Torah scroll(s) to the Holy Ark. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, however, usually recite it at the time when the Torah scroll(s) are taken out of the Ark. At these respective points, it was common practice throughout the years to add various blessings, including the Blessing for the Ruler of the Country. After the establishment of Israel, some synagogues also read a prayer for the welfare of the President of Israel, but this practice has virtually ceased today. The Prayer for the State of Israel has a tune which is often used, and some synagogues sing a different, festive tune on holidays. The congregation stands while the leader reads the prayer, and in some synagogues everyone reads it aloud.

He belonged to NgƒÅ Puhi, by way of the Te Hikutu and NgƒÅti Hau hap≈´. In 1833, he founded a religious cult called Te Nakahi around the Bay of Islands and Omanaia, and later served as a spiritual advisor to Hone Heke. Early life Papahurihia's early life is uncertain, but his parents were allegedly matakite (seers), capable of divination and teleportation. It is possible that he attended the Anglican missions at Rangihoua, where he learned to read and developed his understanding of the Bible. The historical record first attests to him in 1833 when Richard Davis, a missionary from Te Waimate mission, encountered his followers at Taiamai. He was later told by the chief Te Morenga that the people of Taiamai had begun to worship a God called Papahurihia. A year later, Henry Williams gave the first description of their beliefs, which had spread along the Kawakawa river and had adherents at Kororareka, including Tƒ´tore and Waikato. Nakahi Papahurihia claimed to have been visited by the snake from the Book of Genesis, who demanded to be worshipped. The snake was known as Nakahi (from the Hebrew nahash, meaning \\"serpent\\"). He established a religion which incorporated both MƒÅori and Judeo-Christian beliefs; Nakahi was identified as a ngarara, a kind of taniwha, and its followers, believing themselves to be descended from the ten lost tribes of Israel, called themselves Hurai (Jews) and observed the Jewish Sabbath. They were baptised and would gather around a flagpole at night to worship Nakahi, who would appear to them. The Hurai believed in an abundant heaven, described by Catholic missionary Louis Catherin Servant as \\"... the land of happiness, the residence of those who are good. You feel there neither the rigours of cold, nor of hunger or thirst; you enjoy unending light. Everything is found in plenty, flour, sugar, guns, ships; there too murder and sensual pleasure reign.\\" The evil, such as the non-believing missionaries and those who slandered Nakahi, would burn in a fire. Papahurihia used the metaphor of a tree: only his followers could ascend the straight tree to the sky, while others would move along curved branches and fall into a fiery abyss, lit by Nakahi. Historian Keith Sinclair characterised his teachings as millenarian, though Judith Binney claimed otherwise. Papahurihia also communed with the dead, possibly using ventriloquy to make a \\"whistling sighing\\" sound. The Wesleyan reverend William Woon, who visited the Hokianga in 1836, said that Papahurihia claimed to be able to raise the dead, but Judith Binney disputes that such a claim was ever made. Hokianga In November 1834 he moved to the Hokianga to spread his teachings. He debated the missionary William White on theological matters at Waima on April, 1835, but for the next few years, his influence seemed to wane. In 1837, he took the name Te Atua Wera (\\"the fiery God\\"). He was sympathetic to the Catholics in the Hokianga, but disliked Protestants. Several of his followers, acting under the chiefs Kaitoke and Pi, engaged in the ritual killings of Protestant missionaries and converts at Te Hikutu and Te Puna. A popular story circulated that Te Atua Wera had given Kaitoke an enchanted musket that would make him invulnerable, but the British captured him after a number of skirmishes anyway. James Busby blamed chief Waikato for instigating hostilities; he had supposedly given them the muskets to carry out the attacks. To restore utu for the capture of Kaitoke, Te Atua Wera's followers later raided European settlers in the Hokianga and stole their property. Flagstaff War In 1843, he claimed to be controlling a large comet which had appeared in the sky; this was seen as an omen of war. Two years later, at the outbreak of the Flagstaff War, Te Atua Wera became a spiritual advisor to Hone Heke. Nakahi would speak to Hone Heke through Te Atua Wera, promising Heke his warriors would not be harmed in battle, so long as they observed both the rites of their ancestors and the European god. During a battle at Puketutu, Nakahi blew away the fire of a Congreve rocket, saving Heke's life. Te Atua Wera was also present at the Battle of Ohaeawai, where he made divinations from the scalp of the dead Lieutenant George Phillpotts and composed two songs, one of which foretold victory against the British. Later life After the war, Papahurihia lived upriver from Omanaia. He was regularly visited by John Webster, a Scottish settler and businessman, and Maxime Petit, a Catholic priest. In the 1850s his anti-Protestant stance had softened, and he was converted to Christianity by Aperahama Taonui. His baptiser was Thomas Buddle. Thereafter he took the name Penetana and ran a school at Rawene in 1859 alongside Taonui. He was later made a warden of police and an assessor by the government in 1861. A government report in 1866 described him as a minor chief, though highly influential, who was loyal to the government. He was consulted by MƒÅori during the Taranaki and Waikato wars as to their outcome. After speaking with the dead, he predicted a stalemate. He died on 3 November, 1875, and was buried at Omanaia by William Rowse, a Wesleyan minister. A later tohunga, Hone Riiwi Toia, communed with his spirit during the Dog Tax War in 1898. Toia established a cult known as Whiowhio (literally \\"whistling\\"), inspired by the strange whistling voice in which Nakahi would speak to the Hurai.

Of PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori descent, she was of Te Arawa and Tuhourangi iwi. Early life Papakura was born in Matata, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand in 1873. Her parents were Englishman William Arthur Thom, a storekeeper, and Pia Ngarotu Te Rihi, a high-born Te Arawa woman of Ngati Wahiao hapu of Tuhourangi, descended from Te Arawa chiefs Tama-te-kapua, Ngatoroirangi, Hei and Ika. Papakura was raised until the age of 10 by her mother's aunt and uncle, Marara Marotaua and Maihi Te Kakau Paraoa, at the small rural village of Parekarangi, where she spoke MƒÅori and learnt her maternal family's history, culture and traditions. When she was 10, her father took over her education and she attended schools in Rotorua and Tauranga, then Hukarere Native School for Girls in Napier. In 1891, aged 18, she married Francis (Frank) Dennan, a surveyor, and had a son, William Francis (Te Aonui) Dennan, later that year. The family lived briefly in the Wairarapa, but Dennan left to work in Taupo and Papakura returned to Whakarewarewa. They divorced in 1900.  Adult life  After secondary school, Papakura moved to live in the thermal springs area of Whakarewarewa in Rotorua and began to learn to be a guide under Guide Sophia Hinerangi. With her wages she was able to support her infant son, William. She was once asked by an overseas visitor if she had a MƒÅori surname, and, glancing around for inspiration. she saw the geyser Papakura nearby and told the visitor her name was Maggie Papakura. From then on, she worked under the name and members of her family also adopted the new surname. In 1901, Papakura was the guide for the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) on their visit to Whakarewarewa. She was noticed by the press, and as a result, she was featured in magazines, calendars, brochures, books, postcards and newspaper society columns. Two years later she published her own guide book, Maggie's Guide to the Hot Lakes, which was a great success. Papakura was also a skilled entertainer and in the early 1900s established the Rotorua Maori Choir, which she took to Sydney on tour in 1910. The tour was so successful that a group of Sydney businesspeople asked her to organise a concert party to go to London for the Festival of Empire celebrations, and in April 1911 Papakura's group left for England. The group consisted of around 40 members of Papakura's family, including her sister Bella, brother Dick and Tuhourangi leader Mita Taupopoki. They group performed at Crystal Palace, the Palace Theatre and White City and were accompanied by an exhibition of Maori artefacts, including a meeting house and storehouse. The tour was highly successful in terms of positive publicity and attention, however it was beset by financial problems. About half the group decided to stay in England, and 4 of the women married Englishmen. The remainder of the group returned to New Zealand in late 1911. Papakura was blamed both for the financial issues and for the group members who hadn't come back. She stayed in New Zealand only briefly and she then returned to England where she continued a relationship with Richard Staples-Browne. She had first met him in 1907 when he had toured New Zealand. The couple were married in 1912 and they lived in Staples- Browne's country home in Oxfordshire, Oddington Grange Margaret Staples- Browne's grave in Oddington During World War I, Papakura and her husband opened their homes in Oxfordshire and London to injured New Zealand troops, and Papakura installed a memorial to fallen Australian and New Zealand Army Corps soldiers in the chapel at Oddington. In 1924, Papakura moved into Oxford and enrolled to study a Bachelor of Science degree in anthropology at the Society of Oxford Home-Students. She wrote a thesis on Maori culture, which she took to the elders at Whakarewarewa for approval before submitting it. Papakura died suddenly three weeks before her thesis examination, on 16 April 1930, from a ruptured aortic artery. She was buried, according to her wishes, in Oddington cemetery; her family in Whakarewarewa erected a memorial to her in the village the following year.  Legacy  Papakura's thesis was published posthumously in 1938 by her friend and fellow Oxford anthropology student T.K. Penniman as The Old-Time Maori. It describes and analyses the customs of Te Arawa from a woman's perspective, including aspects of daily life such as child-rearing and family relationships, which had previously been ignored by male writers. Papakura also corrected the erroneous assumptions of Pakeha ethnologists in her work, which was the first extensive published ethnographic work by a Maori scholar. The book was re-printed in 1986 by New Women's Press. Papakura's house, named after her ancestor Tuhoromatakaka and built by master carver Tene Waitere, still stands in the village at Whakarewarewa. In 2007, a biography of Papakura was published by Paul Diamond, Makereti: Taking Maori to the World, and she was the subject of an exhibition at the National Library of New Zealand.

He was director of the Thames School of Mines for seven years, and went on to become the dean of the mining faculty at the University of Otago for 18 years. Early life He was born in Kintore, Aberdeenshire, in Scotland on 2 July 1857 to James Park and Mary Snowie. His father and grandfather were engineers. He studied at the Royal School of Mines in London from 1872 until 1874. He emigrated to New Zealand with his sister in 1875. Initially he worked as a cadet on a sheep farm near Castlepoint, then in 1878 he started work with the Geological Survey of New Zealand as a field assistant where he made geological and botanical expeditions. Career From 1882 to 1885, he worked for the Department of Lands and Survey as a computing draughtsman. While there, he organised expeditions around Nelson and he made the first ascent of Mt Franklin. In 1883, he starting laying the foundations that formed the Nelson Philosophical Society. In 1885 he returned to the Geological Survey, this time as a mining geologist. Park's duties included exploration and he made surveys in the districts of Taranaki, Nelson and West Coast districts. In 1889 he became the director of the Thames School of Mines, which had been founded in 1885‚Äì86 to teach miners basic skills in geology, chemistry, metallurgy, physics and mathematics. In addition to writing the syllabus, Park supervised schools at Coromandel and Kuotunu and he started a building programme. Students from the Thames schools achieved excellent results. Meanwhile, he continued to explore the surrounding region and published papers, and he took on the role of manager of the Government experimental cyanide works which he installed at the school, and also used it to teach students the cyanide process to extract gold from quartz. From 1896 to 1900, Park worked as consulting mining engineer for the Anglo-Continental goldmining syndicate. In 1901 he went back to teaching, as professor of mining and mining geology at the University of Otago School of Mines. After updating the curriculum and moving from the \\"tin shed\\" to a new building, he became the dean of the mining faculty in 1913. He took up many roles service roles in his field. He was President of the Otago Institute, President of the Otago University Rugby Football Club, and President of the New Zealand Society of Mining Engineers. In 1931 he retired at age 75, and the University's professorial board recorded that he \\"made the Diploma of the School a passport to the Mining Companies throughout the world\\". Park wrote seven textbooks on mining topics, and total sales are estimated at more than 70,000 copies. His first book, The Cyanide Process of Gold Extraction (1894), was published in ten editions. Personal life On 24 May 1880 he married Frances Olive Rogers and they had seven daughters and three sons. One son grew to become Air Commodore Sir Keith Park, who had a distinguished career in the Royal Air Force in two world wars. Frances left him (it is unclear when), and she died in 1917. He re-married on 11 July 1918, to Jane Clow Gray.

By 1984, the \\"old guard\\" (first generation of party leaders) had been governing Singapore for approximately a quarter of a century. Aging leadership was a key concern, and the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew sought to groom younger leaders. In a speech on 29 September 1984, Lee argued that though the first generation of leaders was still \\"alert and fully in charge\\", to hang on to power until they had become feeble would allow power to be wrested from them, with no say in who their successors were. On 30 September, at the Ordinary Party Conference, power was transferred to the second generation of leaders, who were elected to the Central Executive Committee in place of all the old CEC members; of the 14-member CEC, only Lee Kuan Yew remained the only \\"old guard\\" leader. According to a report to the Library of Congress, the old guard were confident in their \\"rectitude\\" and discretion in using their extensive political powers for Singapore's common good, but were not as confident in the next generation in doing so. Various limits on executive power were considered, in order to minimise the chances of corruption. These included a popularly-elected President of Singapore with substantial, nonceremonial powers. This particular reform was enacted with a constitutional amendment in 1991. The old guard also sought to eschew the use of PAP as a central political institution, seeking to \\"depoliticise\\" and disperse power among society, and sought to include low-level community leaders in government. A policy of cross-fertilisation was enacted: exchange of leaders, \\"elites\\" and talent would take place between private and government sectors, civilian and military segments of society, and between the party and the National Trades Union Congress. The next generation of leaders in the late 1980s was split between the factions of then Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong and the older, more-experienced Goh Chok Tong. Lee Hsien Loong was supported by bureaucrats in the Ministry of Defence and army colleagues in the Singapore Armed Forces; Goh Chok Tong had more influence in the Singapore Civil Service, the Cabinet and the government-linked corporations. Lee Kuan Yew himself remained Prime Minister and in the CEC until 1990, when he stepped down in favour of Goh Chok Tong as PM. Lee Hsien Loong became PM in 2004.

In 1902, Von Zedlitz was appointed as a professor of modern languages at Victoria University College, and was the fifth professor to join the college. He also served as an official government translator. Following the outbreak of the First World War the New Zealand Government requested to have him dismissed from his post, a request that was rebuffed by the university. The subsequent passing of the Alien Enemy Teachers Act 1915 enabled the Government to overrule the university. In 1936 he was made professor emeritus, and elected to the Senate of the University of New Zealand.

He was baptised in Cholderton, Wiltshire, England in December 1804. After marrying his second wife Betsy Rose in 1836, they moved to France where their first two children were born. They emigrated to New Zealand in 1839, with their daughter dying en route. They lived in Wellington, where two more children were born before his wife died in 1845. Becoming chief constable at Akaroa, he put his eldest son out to work and the younger two children into care, but struggled to pay for this from his reduced wages. Zillwood also worked as Akaroa's postmaster. He married again in 1850, and was reunited with his younger children, one of whom died in 1853. Later that year the local police force was halved and Zillwood lost his job. He turned to drink as his financial situation worsened, and his wife left him mid-1854. After arranging his affairs, he shot himself in the mouth on Friday 13 October 1854 while on suicide watch and died of his wounds after several days of suffering. His body was buried at night without funeral rites after an inquest found him guilty of felo de se. This appears to be the earliest reported felo de se in New Zealand.

It originally aired on Showtime on October 16, 2011. Carrie's investigation into the Prince gets her closer to what Abu Nazir is planning. Brody tries to embrace his hero status in the media. Plot Prince Farid (Amir Arison) leaves the room after having sex with Lynne (Brianna Brown). While he is gone, Lynne takes the opportunity to download the contents of his phone using the device Carrie gave her. The download finishes undetected, and the Prince returns. He then clasps a diamond necklace around Lynne's throat. At the Brody household, a large TV crew is present, preparing for a televised interview with Brody (Damian Lewis) and his family. Dana (Morgan Saylor) later hangs out with her friends and discusses the surge of media attention. Unhappy with the media's dishonest portrayal of her family, she considers sabotaging the interview. Dana reveals more discontent in a car ride with her mother, Jessica (Morena Baccarin); she knows about the affair with Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) and resents her for it. Brody conducts the first part of his TV interview. The host asks Brody about his experiences as a prisoner of war. Brody says his captors tried to make him lose his faith, told him his Marine brothers were not coming to get him, and that his wife was in the arms of another man. An event that he fails to mention is shown in a flashback, where Brody is being 'saved' from a beating by Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban), who comforts him and gives him food. The second part of the interview is with Brody and his whole family to discuss his re-integration with the family. The interview goes smoothly, possibly thanks to a talk Brody had with Dana beforehand, where he asked her to cut her mother some slack, as she and everyone in the family are going through a difficult time. Carrie (Claire Danes) briefs a team at headquarters regarding the lead on Abu Nazir. She reports that Prince Farid was seen talking to Nazir, and that her asset has procured the Prince's phone data. She expects there to be evidence of a money transfer on the phone. Later, Carrie has another rendezvous with Lynne, who delivers the contents of the Prince's phone. Lynne says she has barely left the Prince's side for over a year, and expresses doubt that he could have terrorist connections. Carrie turns the phone data over to an analyst at the CIA, but they find nothing incriminating at all. Later, in a night club with newly recruited girls, Lynne is instructed by the Prince's majordomo, Latif Bin Walid (Alok Tewari), to visit a new business partner of the Prince's and show him a good time. Lynne is rather suspicious as she usually gets such orders directly from the Prince. Slipping away to the restroom just before leaving the club, Lynne calls Carrie and appraises her of the situation. Carrie smells a potential lead and lies to Lynne again, assuring her that the CIA has people watching and protecting her. Carrie and Virgil (David Marciano) set off immediately, in an attempt to keep tabs on Lynne themselves. Lynne leaves the club but her \\"driver\\" shoots her dead, takes her diamond necklace, and leaves her body in the alley. Carrie and Virgil then arrive on the scene. They see that Lynne is dead and leave immediately at Virgil's insistence. The Prince is interviewed by the police regarding Lynne's murder and seems genuinely devastated, further casting doubt on his involvement. Carrie is wracked with guilt after she promised Lynne protection that was not really there. Saul tries to get her mind back on the case. Carrie speculates that the true connection to Abu Nazir might not be the Prince, but somebody in his entourage. Saul reminds her of the missing diamond necklace, and how jewelry is often used to transfer funds quickly and as a means of financing terrorist operations. Latif negotiates the sale of Lynne's necklace, eventually getting $400,000 for it. A young couple is then shown purchasing a new home. The realtor congratulates them on their new home, and comments on how unusual it is to have a couple so young pay for their home in full in cash. A plane flies overhead, and she assures them that they will soon get used to the sound. However, they seem quite pleased with the fact that the house is very close to the airport, claiming it is convenient. Production Co-executive producer Chip Johannessen wrote the episode, his first of four writing credits for the first season. It was directed by Dan Attias. Reception Ratings The original broadcast had 1.08 million viewers, which was equal with the rating of the series premiere. Reviews Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic rated \\"Clean Skin\\" a 4.5/5, calling it \\"another gem of an episode\\".

Laid down as Bulknes, before launching the vessel's name was changed to Brooknes. The ship was constructed and completed in 1970 and was initially owned by the Swedish company Kristian Jebsens Rederi A/S. In 1974, Algoma Central purchased the vessel, registered the ship in Germany and renamed it Algosea. The ship was sent to Swan Hunter in England to be lengthened. Emerging in 1976, Algosea sailed for Canada for conversion to a self-unloading bulk carrier at Herb Fraser and Associates in Port Colborne, Ontario. Algosea, which transported road salt between ports in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes suffered three collisions and two groundings during its career. The vessel was renamed Sauniere in 1982 and continued in service until 2009 when the bulk carrier was sold for scrap and broken up in Turkey in 2010. Description The ship as constructed was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . Brooknes had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 13,098 and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 21,200. The ship had a molded depth of and had six hatches for six holds. The bulk carrier was equipped with six Velle-type derricks with one pair forward facing, the other aft. Brooknes was initially powered by two Helsingor Skibs & Msk. 8-cylinder diesel engines rated at . The engines powered one shaft turning a 4-bladed controllable pitch propeller and a bow thruster. The ship had a maximum speed of . In 1975, the vessel was lengthened to overall and the ship's tonnage increased to 16,709 GRT and 24,481 DWT. Brooknes was given an additional hold, had its derricks removed and given self-unloading equipment. The self-unloading equipment was composed of a stern-mounted discharge boom that could discharge at per hour. In 1981, the ship was re-engined with two MaK 6M552AK 6-cylinder diesel engines rated at . Construction and career The ship was ordered from Lithgows Ltd. by Kristian Jebsens Rederi A/S and was laid down on 20 January 1970 at their yard in Glasgow, Scotland with the yard number 1170. Laid down as Bulknes, the ship was renamed Brooknes before launching. The ship was launched on 2 September 1970 and completed on 18 December 1970. Brooknes was registered in Hamburg, Germany. In 1973, Langra Schiffahrtsges GmbH and Company KG took over operations of the vessel while ownership remained with Kristian Jebsens Rederi A/S. In 1974, Algoma Central sought a replacement vessel for which had sunk on 21 November. On 1 January 1976, Algoma Central purchased Brooknes for US$7.5 million. Algoma Central renamed the vessel Algosea and sent it to Swan Hunter's yard at North Shields, England to be lengthened. Emerging in 1976, Algosea then crossed the Atlantic Ocean to undergo conversion to a self-discharging bulk carrier at Herb Fraser and Associates at their yard in Port Colborne, Ontario. While moving through the Welland Canal, Algosea had its first collision, hitting the canal wall at Lock 1, losing its cables and being blown across Lock 2. Algosea entered active service on 19 October 1976. Algoseas primary cargo was road salt. Algosea delivered its cargo along the eastern North American seaboard as far south as the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes. Algosea suffered internal damage during a storm in 1976. After experiencing issues with the engines of Algosea, Algoma Central ordered the ship to be re-engined at Halifax, Nova Scotia in late-1981, early 1982. In 1982, Algosea was chartered to Navigation Sonamar and operated by the Societe Qu√©b√©coise d'Exploration Mini√®re (SOQUEM) to transport salt from the Magdalen Islands to ports along the North American east coast, the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. On 6 June 1982, Algosea collided with a pier at Port Weller, Ontario. The ship's bow was extensively damaged, and the ship was forced to sail to Port Arthur Shipbuilding to have its bow replaced. The new bow was ice-strengthened and the ship returned to service in August re-flagged to Quebec City, Quebec and renamed Sauniere, which is French for \\"salter\\". On 26 April 1984, Sauniere ran aground in the St. Lawrence River near Trois- Rivi√®res, Quebec. The ship suffered no damage and continued on to Baltimore, Maryland to pick up its next cargo. In December 1985 unionized longshoremen in Providence, Rhode Island picketed Sauniere because it unloaded rock salt without union help. On 15 December 1995, the ship ran aground at Fairport, Ohio, again without damage. On 15 September 1996, Sauniere grounded on Bay State Shoal in the St. Lawrence River near Brockville, Ontario. The bottom shell plating on the starboard side was damaged and the #1 starboard ballast tank being was holed in three places. After being freed, Sauniere sailed to Hamilton, Ontario to unload its cargo and then to Port Weller Dry Docks at St. Catharines, Ontario for repairs. Sauniere underwent a major refit in late 1998, early 1999, followed by an even larger one in late 2001 and early 2002. On 21 September 2006, the ship lost its starboard anchor near Grande Entr√©e, Magdalen Islands. On 18 September 2007, the ship collided with the south sea wall of the Canso Causeway. The vessel suffered a dent above the waterline outside the #1 portside tank. A crack was discovered in the forepeak in January 2009 that necessitated immediate repairs. On 1 March 2009, the ship was laid up at Montreal, Quebec. Sauniere was sold to Avsar GS in 2011, towed to Aliaƒüa, Turkey and broken up with demolition listed as complete on 2 July 2011.

Topley Landing is located just off Highway 118. It is within the Pacific Time Zone and observes daylight saving time. The largest local settlement is Smithers, about west of Topley Landing. Topley lies about to the south. Description The community has 83 homes, with a few full-time residents, most of the homes being seasonal dwellings for the large influx of tourists visiting in the summer months. The sockeye salmon fishery, which opens for six weeks from the beginning of August, attracts many campers and boaters to the area. The Nat'oot'en Nation, a First Nations band government, has a community called Tachek (or Tachet) nearby. History Topley Landing dates back to 1822, when it was established by the Hudson's Bay Company for local natives to trade furs for other goods, and named after an early settler, William J. Topley. Catholic missionaries took up residence in 1848 and a small church was built. A post office opened in 1921, followed by a one-room school, which was stocked with five hundred books by the retired Topley who was living in Alberta. The church was used until 1988, when much of the population moved to nearby Granisle, where two copper mines had opened, and the church became disused.

Life The son of William Henry Overall and Rosetta Davey, he was born on 18 January 1829 at St. John's Wood. He was educated at a private school and then at the newly opened City of London College, Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate. He entered the office of the town clerk at the Guildhall, City of London in 1847, and in 1857 was appointed sub-librarian of the Guildhall Library, which then consisted of a few rooms in the front of the Guildhall. In 1865, on the death of William Turner Alchin, he received the appointment of librarian, and, on the completion of the new building in Basinghall Street at the eastern end of the Guildhall, he superintended the move of the collections to the new building and arranged the museum. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in May 1868, and was for many years a member of the councils of the Library Association and the London and Middlesex Arch√¶ological Society. He died at Crouch End, Middlesex, after a long illness, on 28 June 1888, and was buried in St. Pancras cemetery, Finchley, on 3 July. Works In 1877 he was presented with the honorary freedom and livery of the Clockmakers' Company, of whose library and museum of clocks and watches he had prepared a printed catalogue in 1875; which was followed in 1881 by his History of the company. In conjunction with his cousin, H. C. Overall, he prepared for the corporation library committee in 1878 an Analytical Index to the Series of Records known as the Remembrancia preserved among the Archives of the City of London, A.D. 1579‚Äì1664, with biographical and historical notes.

He followed his father's path of education and became a barrister in London. With his colleague and friend Charles George Tripp, he formed the plan to emigrate to Canterbury, New Zealand, to take up sheep farming. They were the first to take up land in the Canterbury high country for this purpose. When they divided their land into separate holdings, Acland kept the that made up the Mount Peel station. Acland was a committed Anglican and married Emily Weddell Harper, who was one of the daughters of Bishop Harper. He gave the land for a church, which they called the Church of the Holy Innocents with reference to four children buried there, including two of the Aclands. They had a homestead built for themselves, which was probably the first large building in South Canterbury constructed from permanent materials. Both the church and the homestead are registered with Heritage New Zealand. Acland took on many public roles, including serving on the Legislative Council for a third of a century. John Acland and his wife Emily died in 1904 and 1905, respectively. They were survived by eight of their children, including the prominent surgeon Hugh Acland. The homestead is still owned by the Acland family, who take care of the restoration of the church, as it was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Early life Acland was born in 1823 in Devon, England, the ninth and youngest child of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet and his wife, Lydia Elizabeth Acland (n√©e Hoare). Like his father, he was educated at Harrow and the University of Oxford, from where he graduated with a Master of Arts in 1845. He practised as a barrister in London from 1848. His friend, Charles George Tripp, introduced him to members of the Canterbury Association, who proposed the organised settlement of Canterbury in New Zealand with Anglican ideals; introductions included those to James FitzGerald and John Robert Godley. Tripp also worked in law. Sheep farming Holnicote, the homestead at Mount Peel (1880s watercolour) Acland and Tripp gave up their profession and emigrated to New Zealand in 1854 in the Royal Stuart to become sheep farmers. They arrived in Lyttelton on 4 January 1855. Both needed to obtain experience first and thus worked as cadets on established runs; Acland gained experience under Henry Tancred, whilst Tripp worked in Halswell and for one of the Brittan brothers. On 30 July 1855, they applied for land in the foothills in an area that was unexplored and their choice was guesswork; whilst they arrived only four years after organised settlement of Canterbury began, all the suitable land on the Canterbury Plains had been taken up already. Established runholders did not take them seriously, and some laughed at them for wanting to take up high country land, but Acland's attitude was that \\"in the Colonies you always like to see for yourself, and the worse account you hear of unoccupied country, the greater the reason for going to look at it.\\" In the spring and summer of 1855/56, they started exploring the area. Both had ¬£2,000 of capital, which was insufficient to buy an established station. They took up land including Mount Somers, Mount Possession, Mount Peel, Orari Gorge and parts of Hakatere and Mesopotamia, and were the first who put sheep in the high country. The first station they worked on was Mount Peel from May 1856, and while they prepared the run, they left their sheep with Dr Moorhouse, a brother of William Sefton Moorhouse, on the other side of the Rangitata River. Their partnership was dissolved in 1862, and Acland retained Mount Peel, which then comprised over . Between 1865 and 1867, Acland had the Mount Peel homestead built from locally fired bricks. It was probably the first large house in South Canterbury built of permanent materials. The architecture is unusual and it is assumed that Acland brought the plans with him on the return from a visit to England in 1861. Acland's intention was for the house to form the nucleus of a village, but this did not happen. Acland called the house 'Holnicote', after the family property in England. In September 1984, the homestead was registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category I heritage item, with registration number 313. In 2010, a recent restoration and structural upgrade won the Canterbury prize of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) in the category 'Heritage and Conservation'. The earthquake strengthening was timely, as it was carried out just prior to the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Family Standing from left: Lucy, Harriet and Emily; sitting: Bessie, JBA and Rosa (1890) John and Emily Acland with (from left) Rosa, John and Bessie On 17 January 1860, Acland married Emily Weddell Harper, the eldest daughter of Bishop Harper, at St Michael's Church. The Bishop's fifth daughter, Sarah Shephard Harper, was married at the same ceremony. In 1858, Charles Tripp had married Ellen Shephard Harper, the third daughter of Bishop Harper. With Acland's marriage, the friends became brothers in law. In the same ceremony as Tripp, the Bishop's second daughter, Mary Anna Harper, married Charles Blakiston. The Aclands had eleven children. Two of them, Barton Dyke (1860-1863)Armorial Families: A Complete Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage, and a Directory of Some Gentlemen of Coat-armour, and Being the First Attempt to Show which Arms in Use at the Moment are Borne by Legal Authority.

Five daughters (Harriet Dyke, Lucy Alice Dyke, Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Dyke, Emily Rosa Dyke, Agnes Dyke and Mary Emily Dyke) lived to adulthood. John Dyke Acland returned to live in England and was a Justice of the Peace in Somerset. Henry Dyke Acland was Chairmen of the Board of Governors of Canterbury College (1918‚Äì1928) and became the Danish consul to Christchurch in 1926. Hugh Acland, later to become a prominent surgeon, was their eleventh and youngest child. Hugh Acland's son Jack Acland became MP for . JBA Acland's sister Agnes married Arthur Mills, who later became MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. His father's baronetcy was passed onto his brother Thomas. Another brother, Henry, was a physician and educator. Public roles Stained glass window of the Church of the Holy Innocents at Mount Peel Acland, John Parkin Taylor, Arthur Seymour, James Crowe Richmond, James Rolland, James Prendergast, Henry Miller, Henry Joseph Coote and Alfred Rowland Chetham-Strode were all appointed to the Legislative Council on 8 July 1865. Acland remained a member for over 30 years until his resignation on 1 June 1899. He was chairman of the Mount Peel Road Board from its inception in 1870. From 1873 to 1878, he was on the Board of Governors of Canterbury College. Church of the Holy Innocents Church of the Holy Innocents at Mount Peel Acland was active in the Anglican Church, a member of the synod for many years and licensed as a lay reader. In 1866, he donated land for a church where four children who died in infancy were buried, including two of the Acland children. Emily Acland laid the foundation stone in December 1868 and the first service was held in the church on 30 May 1869 by his father in law. The church, which has capacity for 80 people, was consecrated on 12 December 1869. Its name, the Church of the Holy Innocents, was chosen in reflection of the four infants buried in the location. The stained glass window in the wall behind the altar was destroyed in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, only months before the church was due to be earthquake strengthened. John and Rosemary Acland, descendants of JBA Acland who still live at Mount Peel, pulled every splinter of stained glass out of the rubble that they could find. This will allow a stained-glass artist, Graham Stewart, to restore the window. In December 2003, the church was registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category II heritage item, with registration number 1976. Death Acland died in Christchurch on 18 May 1904. He was buried at the Mount Peel Church Cemetery. Emily Acland died at her Christchurch residence on 23 July 1905. Survived by three sons and five daughters, she was buried at Mount Peel Church Cemetery.

It has about 2,100 inhabitants.  Geography  Lauenstein lies in the Weser Uplands, not far from the only low saddle in the crest of the Ith, in a valley that descends eastwards at right angles to the Ith ridge. Part of its more recent built-up area extends out of the valley to the eastern slopes of the Ith and into the Saale valley.  History   Feudal tenure  Lauenstein in 1654 The feudal lords in the district (Amt) area were the barons of Homburg, who exercised power from 1152 to 1409. Their seat was the castle of Homburg near Eschershausen. The counts of Spiegelberg were also feudal lords here from 1152 to 1557. They resided at Spiegelberg Castle and later at Coppenbr√ºgge Castle. Another important feudal lord was Bock von Nordholz, who was resident at Nordholz Castle in Nordholz on the Osterwald.  Middle Ages  Around 1215 Count Bernard of Poppenburg built Spiegelberg Castle and called himself thereafter Count Bernard of Spiegelberg. In 1226 the demise of the Spiegelberg was reported,Margret Zimmermann, Hans Kensche: Burgen und Schl√∂sser im Hildesheimer Land. 1. Auflage Hildesheim: Lax, 1998, p. 95, when the barons of Homburg from Stadtoldendorf fought for the territorial estate of Bernard of Spiegelberg and were able to unite it with their lordship of Homburg into an advocacy (Vogtei). Bernard had to leave the country by order of the emperor. Above the present village of Lauenstein the Homburgs built Lauenstein Castle, probably in the 13th century, which became the new Castrum Lewenstein. It was mentioned as such for the first time in 1247, when Henry of Homburg transferred the castle to the Welf duke, Otto the Child and received it back as a fief. Shortly thereafter villages in the area were abandoned as their inhabitants sought the protection of the castle and established the new village of Lauenstein at its foot.

Facts  The appellant government of South Africa had instituted action in a Local Division against the respondent, Fibrespinners & Weavers, for damages for the loss of certain grainbags which had been stored by the respondent for reward in terms of a contract of deposit. In terms of a letter written by the government, replacing the terms of the original contract, Fibrespinners was, in consideration for arranging and maintaining, inter alia, an all-risks insurance policy covering the grainbags, \\"absolved from all responsibility for loss of or damage howsoever arising in respect of\\" the grainbags \\"whilst in the care of your company and in or upon any premises owned or used by your company.\\" Over a period of time a quantity of the grainbags had been stolen by three persons, one of whom was Fibrespinners' chief security officer. The government averred that Fibrespinners was liable on the following alternative grounds: # by reason of its breach of contract in failing, upon demand, to deliver to the government the grainbags in question; # by reason of gross negligence; # by reason of negligence; or # by reason of vicarious responsibility for the theft committed by its servant. Fibrespinners successfully excepted to the claim on the grounds that the averments in the particulars were insufficient to sustain the cause of action.  Arguments  In an appeal, the government contended # that the exemption clause in the letter, which did not in terms refer to negligence, had to be construed in accordance with the contra proferentem rule as not relating to liability for loss or damage caused by negligence, but only to liability which arose from some other cause, such as breach of contract, and that the exemption clause applied only where compensation was claimed on a contractual basis, not a delictual basis; and # that the exemption clause ought to be so construed as not to apply to responsibility for loss or damage caused by the bailee's gross negligence.  Judgment  The court held that the intention of the parties in regard to the exemption clause was to substitute in the government's favour a right of recourse against the insurance company in the place of such rights of recourse as appellant had against Fibrespinners as bailee; the insurance policy in question covered the government for loss of the grainbags as a result of theft or Fibrespinners' negligence or that of its employees. The court held further that in law Fibrespinners was liable to compensate the government if the loss or damage was caused # by its own wilful wrongdoing or negligent conduct; or # possibly by the wilful wrongdoing (i.e. theft) or negligent conduct on the part of its servants, acting in the scope, and within the course, of their employment as such. The words of the exemption were, the court found, prima facie sufficiently comprehensive in their ordinary meaning to bring under the protective umbrella of the exemption the liability for the loss or damage in 1. or 2. above. As to the government's contention that the possibility that negligent conduct on the part of the bailee might give rise to alternative causes of action, the one based on contract and the other on delict, the court ruled that this could not render the exemption clause ambiguous and thereby necessitate the use of aids to interpretation. Fibrespinners only required, and could only be granted, exemption from liability for any loss or damage caused by unintentional unlawful conduct: that is, for any loss or damage caused by its breach of contract or by negligence on its part or the part of its employees. It was that exemption which the widely worded clause sought to achieve and those risks that the stipulated insurance sought to cover. As to the government's contention that there was no justification for so restricting the plain meaning of the words of the exemption clause as contended for, the court determined that there was also no reason of public policy why it should be held that, in so far as the clause referred to loss or damage caused by Fibrespinners' gross negligence, it was not enforceable. The decision in the Durban and Coast Local Division, in Government of the Republic of South Africa (Department of Industries) v Fibre Spinners & Weavers (Pty) Ltd1977 (2) SA 324. was thus confirmed.

Prior to his death, Ries was described as \\"the greatest living religions scholar\\".  Life  Born in Fouches, near Arlon, Belgium, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Namur on 12 August 1945. After graduating with a doctorate of Philosophy and receiving a licentiate in philology and Oriental history from the Catholic University of Leuven, Ries taught at the university from 1960 to 1968. After the university split in 1968, he taught at the French-speaking Universit√© catholique de Louvain, where he founded the Centre d'Histoire des Religions (which has recently been named after him). During that period, he was also a member of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue from 1979 to 1985. In 1990, Ries retired from active work. Among the non- specialists in the anglophone world he was most known for his series for young people Religions of Humanity which he edited with American anthropologist Lawrence E. Sullivan (Head of the Centre for the Study of World Religions at Harvard University from 1990 to 2003). Ries and Sullivan received the Hans Christian Andersen Award for these series in 2000. Ries has developed a renewed religious anthropology in which the religious dimension of humankind is taken seriously. His conclusion was the same as that of the French paleontologist and co-discoverer of the Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) Yves Coppens, with whom he collaborated, i.e. that human beings have been religious right from the beginning. In 2009, Ries donated his library, all his manuscripts, notes and documents relating to courses, and the correspondences he had with religious historians across the globe, to the Catholic University of Milan. On 6 January 2012, it was announced that Ries would be created a cardinal the next month, and was appointed Titular Archbishop of Bellicastrum on 23 January 2012. He received episcopal consecration at the parish church of Notre-Dame de la Visitation, in Villers-Notre-Dame, Hainaut on 11 February 2012. The principal consecrator was Archbishop Giacinto Berloco, Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium, assisted by Bishop R√©my Victor Vancottem of Namur and Bishop Guy Harpigny of Tournai as principal co-consecrators.

Innes CJ, De Villiers JA, Kotz JA, Wessels JA and Stratford AJA were the judges.  Facts  Wells, defendant in a magistrate's court, when sued for the purchase price of a lighting plant purchased by him from the plaintiff SA Alumenite, raised the defence that he had been induced to enter into the contract by certain misrepresentations made by the salesman who, acting on behalf of SA Alumenite, had negotiated the sale. Wells claimed in reconvention for an order rescinding the contract on the ground of the alleged misrepresentations. It appeared that an order form, signed by Wells, contained the following condition: > I hereby acknowledge that I have signed this order irrespective of any > representoons made to me by any of your representatives and same is not > subject to cancellation by me. The magistrate dismissed SA Alumenite's exception to the claim in reconvention. The matter was then taken by consent, in terms of Proclamation 145 of 1923,s 73(ii). to the Eastern Districts Local Division, which upheld the exception to the plea and also to the counterclaim. The case went before the Appellate Division on special leave.  Judgment  The Appellate Division held that, in the absence of any allegation that the representations made were fraudulent, Wells was bound by the condition in the order. His plea, therefore, disclosed no defence. The decision of the Eastern Districts Local Division, in South African Alumenite Company v Wells, was thus confirmed.

Life He was elder son of Robert O'Byrne and his wife Martha Trougher, daughter of Joseph Clark. He was a young man when he conceived of publishing a record of the service of every living Royal Navy officer of the executive branch. The work proved an unrewarding struggle. Sir Francis Thornhill Baring appointed him librarian at the Admiralty; but his successor, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, did not confirm the position. Recognition for O'Byrne's work came from the Royal United Service Institution, and in 1857 he was specially elected a member of the Athen√¶um Club. On the death of his cousin Georgiana O'Byrne, he succeeded to the Cabinteely estate, County Wicklow. In 1872, he was High Sheriff of Wicklow, and was M.P. for the county from 1874 to 1880. But the property to which he had succeeded was heavily mortgaged; the mortgagees foreclosed, and O'Byrne was left with little. In 1884, he was awarded ¬£100 from the royal bounty. The Admiralty refused him a post. During his last years O'Byrne's health broke down, and he was mainly dependent on his daughter. In the summer of 1896 he was granted ¬£125 from the royal bounty. He died in South Kensington on 7 July 1896. His wife, by whom he had one daughter, predeceased him. Works As a young man, O'Byrne conceived the idea of a Biographica Navalis (Naval Biographical Dictionary). It took six years for him to publish the first parts in 1845 and the full set of 1,400 pages was published by 1849. The Admiralty records were disorganised; O'Byrne corresponded with the subjects of his memoirs, supplementing their statements with the official records. He did not achieve much financial success from his work, though the Royal United Service Institute rewarded him with a piece of plate and a gift of ¬£400. While he aimed for meticulous accuracy, the biographical entries were often not particularly objectively written, as he invited serving officers to submit their own autobiographical conclusions. The accounts of their lives thus often make them appear as paragons of naval virtues. In 1859, he began a second edition of the Dictionary, containing memoirs of officers of the civil branches of the service. It was never finished and he reached no further than the letter G.

It was formed by six self-described centrists MPs who had been expelled from the United Party on 19 January 1977 for refusing to accept the party's decision to accept the Marais plan to create a new united opposition party, which became the New Republic Party. The six constituted themselves as the Independent United Party. The party renamed itself the South African Party (SAP) and elected MP Myburgh Streicher as its leader at its founding conference held in Pretoria on 27 and 28 May 1977. The new party committed itself to a federal or confederal solution to the country's political future and to the maintenance of separate group identities under white leadership with the rejection of power-sharing at every level. The party contested the 1977 general election and won three seats in the House of Assembly, however, Streicher was defeated in his Cape Town constituency of Wynberg. John Wiley became the party's new leader following the election. In parliament, the SAP supported the government during the 1979 Muldergate Scandal. On 13 June 1980, SAP leader John Wiley announced that his party was disbanding and that its three MPs were joining the ruling National Party. Wiley served as Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in P.W. Botha's government, and was the only cabinet minister of English descent, until his death in 1987 of a gunshot wound to the head. Wiley's death remains an unsolved case, although suicide had not been ruled out. His son, Mark Wiley, is a Democratic Alliance legislator in Western Cape province. Streicher was returned to the House of Assembly in 1981 as a National Party MP. He served from 1986 to 1989 as deputy minister of transportation and from 1994 to 1997 chairman of the National Party caucus in parliament.

It is a fictional account of the early life of Yolande of Lorraine, daughter of Ren√© of Anjou, in which she is depicted as a beautiful blind sixteen-year-old princess who lives in a protected garden paradise. The play was highly popular in the 19th century. It was translated into many languages, copied, parodied and adapted. The Russian adaptation by Vladimir Zotov was used as the basis for the 1892 opera Iolanta, written by Tchaikovsky, with libretto by his brother Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The name of the central character is given as \\"Iolanthe\\" in the original and in early English versions. Characters *King Ren√© of Naples, Count of Provence *Iolanthe, his daughter *Tristan, Count of Vaud√©mont *Sir Geoffrey of Orange, Tristan's friend *Sir Almerick, a knight in Ren√©'s court *Ebn Jahia, a Moorish physician *Bertrand, guardian of Iolanthe's garden *Martha, his wife Plot At the entrance to a hidden garden in a beautiful Proven√ßal valley Bertrand explains to Almerick that no one must be allowed to enter because the king's daughter Iolanthe is living there in seclusion. The fact that she is blind has been kept secret from all but a few confidants; it has been put out that she is living in a convent. Even Iolanthe herself does not understand that she is blind because no one is allowed to speak to her of light or colour. Nor does she know she is a princess. She was blinded in an accident in infancy and has been attended ever since by the Moorish physician Ebn Jahia, who every day places her in an enchanted sleep and attends to her eyes while she is unconscious. With a combination of medication, magic and astrology, he has predicted that she will be cured when she is 16. This is also when she is due to marry Tristan, Count of Vaud√©mont, who is unaware of her condition. Iolanthe has just passed her 16th birthday. Martha says that Iolanthe has grown up happy, spending her time in song and poetry, and that she will not be able to understand what sight is. Almerick says that he has been sent to inform Bertrand that the king and the physician will be arriving shortly and that Count Tristan is on his way to Provence to marry Iolanthe. King Ren√© and Ebn Jahia arrive. They discuss Iolanthe's cure. Ebn Jahia says that Iolanthe should soon be able to see, but first she must be told that she is blind and made to understand what sight is. Ren√© does not want his daughter's happiness to be broken, so is unwilling to violate Iolanthe's innocence. Ebn Jahia explains that the body and the spirit are intertwined, insisting that Iolanthe must be psychologically prepared for sight. King Ren√© agonises over his decision, while Ebn Jahia places Iolanthe in a sleep using a magical amulet. They leave. Geoffrey and Tristan arrive at the gate. They enter the garden. Tristan tells Geoffrey that he does not want to marry a woman he has never seen; indeed he hates the thought of it. He is only willing to do so from a sense of duty. They enter the garden marvelling at its beauty. Tristan sees the sleeping Iolanthe and immediately falls in love with her. Geoffrey thinks he has been enchanted. Tristan picks up the amulet. He prepares to leave, but Iolanthe wakes, calling for Bertrand and Martha. Geoffrey and Tristan introduce themselves and Iolanthe makes them a drink. The three young people sing troubadour songs to each other. Tristan asks Geoffrey to bring their troops to guard the pass giving entrance to the valley. Geoffrey leaves. Iolanthe and Tristan talk together. He discovers she is blind when she fails to distinguish a white from a red rose. He tries to explain light and colour to her, but she cannot understand him. He declares his love for her and says he will find her father and ask him for her hand in marriage. He leaves. Iolanthe tells Bertrand and Martha that a mysterious stranger has been there and awakened in her confusing new ideas and feelings. Ren√© and Ebn Jahia arrive. Ren√© realises he must now explain to Iolanthe what blindness is. He tries to do so. Iolanthe is perplexed, but Ebn Jahia says that the cure can now be successfully completed. He leads Iolanthe away. Almerick arrives with a letter from Tristan stating that he can no longer marry Iolanthe as he has found his true love. Ren√© is astounded. Tristan and Geoffrey arrive wearing armour. They say their army has taken control of the valley. They demand to know who Ren√© is. He tells them he is the king. Tristan states that he loves the girl who lives in the garden. Ren√© explains that she is Iolanthe, his own daughter and Tristan's fianc√©e. Iolanthe and Ebn Jahia return. She is cured. Everyone rejoices. Background The story is based on the life of Yolande, daughter of King Ren√© of Anjou, who married her cousin Frederick II, Count of Vaud√©mont in 1445. The marriage was a dynastic alliance, arranged to end the dispute which existed between Ren√© of Anjou and Frederick's father, Antoine of Vaud√©mont, regarding the succession to the Duchy of Lorraine. Beyond these facts, the play is fictional. The Count of Vaud√©mont's given name is altered to \\"Tristan\\". The central conceit of Iolanthe's blindness is entirely invented. Subjects related to the court of Ren√© were familiar in the Romantic and Victorian period. Ren√© had been idealised in the Romantic era as a poet- king, whose court in Provence was a genteel haven of literature, architecture and art in a violent era. This image was first popularised in Walter Scott's 1829 novel Anne of Geierstein.Sabine Baring-Gould, In Troubadour-land: A Ramble in Provence and Languedoc, 1891, p.180. Influence and adaptations poster for the 1913 film The portrayal of Yolande in Hertz's play as a saintly dreaming beauty (regularly placed in an entranced sleep by the physician) was immensely popular. The play was translated into other languages. There were several English translations, including by Jane Frances Chapman (1845) and Theodore Martin (1850).Martin, Theodore. King Ren√©'s daughter: a Danish lyrical drama, W. Crosby and H.P. Nichols, 1850; Review of Chapman's translation, Christian Examiner, Volume 8; Volume 43, 1847, p. 460. The heroine's name was retained from the original as \\"Iolanthe\\". The piece was produced in London several times, including at the Strand Theatre in 1849; later by Charles Kean at the Haymarket Theatre; and in 1876 at the Lyceum Theatre by Henry Irving's company in Martin's version, starring Helena Faucit Martin in the title role and Irving as Count Tristan.\\"Miss Ellen Terry's Benefit\\", The Era, 23 May 1880, p. 6; and Correspondence of Henry Irving, 6 June 1876, Henry Irving Foundation Centenary Project website, accessed 12 January 2012 A version of the play adapted by W.G. Wills was performed by Irving's company at the Lyceum in 1880 under the title \\"Iolanthe\\", starring Ellen Terry in the title role and Irving as Count Tristan.\\"Miss Ellen Terry's Benefit\\", The Era, 23 May 1880, p. 6 An unrelated 1882 Gilbert and Sullivan opera was titled Iolanthe after Gilbert asked his producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, to request Irving's permission for use of the name.Ainger, Michael. Gilbert and Sullivan - A Dual Biography, Oxford University Press (2002), p. 212; and Bradley, Ian. The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 364. Neither source records whether Irving ever responded. A musical version of the play itself had already been created in 1871 as a cantata by Henry Smart, setting a verse adaptation by Frederick Enoch.Upton, George P. The Standard Cantatas, Echo, 2010 (reprint of 1888 edition), p. 193. The front page of the score for Edwards' 1893 musical. The Russian translation was by Fyodor Miller. An adaptation by Vladimir Zotov expanded the plot. This version was used as the basis for the opera Iolanta, written by Tchaikovsky to a libretto by his brother, Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It received its premiere on 18 December 1892 in St. Petersburg. In this version much of the magical material in the original is eliminated, making Ebn Jahia more of a scientist than sorcerer. A new character, Robert, Duke of Burgundy, is introduced to replace Geoffrey. Robert becomes Iolanthe's original unwilling fianc√©, who happily relinquishes Iolanthe to his friend Vaud√©mont. In 1893 a new musical version of the drama, by the light opera composer Julian Edwards, was published in America and performed with limited success on Broadway.Julian Edwards, King Ren√©'s Daughter, a lyric drama, John Church, 1893.\\"Julian Edwards, A Composer of Light Opera who has recently become famous\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, 30 October 1896, p. 23.
