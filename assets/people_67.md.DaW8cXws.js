History Faliero Masi commenced making bicycle frames at the Velodromo Vigorelli in Milan in the 1950s, after a career as a professional racer and team mechanic. In 1973 his son Alberto took over the Vigorelli shop. Faliero and two assistants went to the US and began production at a new facility in Carlsbad, California after selling the \\"Cicli Masi\\" name and trademark to an American businessman, Roland Sahm. Later, Faliero returned to Italy. Disputes over volume production caused a break in relations between Masi and the US Masi investors. The ownership of the US trademark remained with the US operation, so the Masi family were unable to sell bikes in the US under their own name. This was despite Faliero Masi having brought over master builder Mario Confente from Italy to help establish the company's U.S. operations, which came to be regarded as producing even finer bicycles than its Italian counterpart. Alberto Masi would later release bikes into the US under the \\"Milano 3V\\" name. The U.S. rights to the Masi name and logo are now owned by Haro Bikes. Many well-known and successful professional cyclists rode Masi bikes, such as Antonio Maspes, Fausto Coppi,http://www.theracingbicycle.com/Faliero_Masi.html Felice Gimondi, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx. In popular culture Dave Stoller, the lead character in the Oscar-winning movie Breaking Away (1979), rides a Masi bicycle. He is played by Dennis Christopher.

It is distributed in tropical Indonesia and India, but has reportedly been found fruiting in European greenhouses on occasion. More toxic than the deathcap (Amanita phalloides), G. sulciceps has been shown to contain the toxins alpha- (α-), beta- (β-) and gamma- (γ-) amanitin; a series of poisonings in Indonesia in the 1930s resulted in 14 deaths from the consumption of this species. It has a typical \\"little brown mushroom\\" appearance, with few obvious external characteristics to help distinguish it from many other similar nondescript brown species. The fruit bodies of the fungus are tawny to ochre, deepening to reddish-brown at the base of the stem. The gills are well-separated, and there is no ring present on the stem. History and taxonomy This species was first described in the literature as Marasmius sulciceps by English Naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1848, based on a specimen found four years earlier growing on old wood in Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka). In 1898, Otto Kuntze transferred the species to Chamaeceras, a genus that has since been subsumed back into Marasmius. Because of its brown-colored spore print, Dutch mycologist Karel Bernard Boedijn transferred the species to the genus Phaeomarasmius 1938. In 1951, he redescribed the species and transferred it to its current position in Galerina. Rolf Singer's comprehensive taxonomical treatment of the Agaricales placed Galerina sulciceps in section Naucoriopsis of the genus Galerina, a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert Kühner in 1935. This section includes small brown-spored fungi what when young have a cap margin that is curved inward, and thin-walled, obtuse, or acute-ended pleurocystidia that are not broadly rounded at the top. All of the poisonous amatoxin- containing Galerina belong to section Naucoriopsis. Description The cap is initially egg-shaped in young specimens, but changes shape as it matures, becoming convex and later more or less flat with a central depression. At the center of the cap is a roughly spherical umbo – a nipple-like protrusion. The cap is hygrophanous, meaning it changes color depending on its state of hydration: the color is tawny in moist specimens, changing to ochre with dark brown edges when dried. The cap diameter is typically , with a surface that is smooth, and almost gelatinous in consistency. The edge of the cap is thin and wavy, and is often split open. The gills are broadly adnate (broadly attached to the stalk slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) to slightly decurrent (running down the length of the stem). Interspersed between the gills are shorter gills, called lamellulae, that start from the cap but do not reach the stem. The gills are broad (up to 4 mm) and thick at the base (1 mm), and when mature can develop veins that run between the gills on the undersurface of the cap. The stem is long, thick, and usually attached centrally to the underside of the cap, although it may sometimes be slightly off-center. Stems are solid, cylindrical, and may be pruinose (dusted with a very fine layer of powder). Berkeley's original description noted a resemblance to a small Marasmius peronatus, a mushroom today known as Gymnopus peronatus. Microscopic characteristics The spores are ellipsoid to almond-shaped, with dimensions of 7.2–9.7 by 4.5–5.8 µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to slightly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 5.5–6 µm. The sterigmata (projections of the basidia that attach the spores) are 5–6 µm long. The pleurocystidia (cystidia located in the gill face) are thin-walled, with long, somewhat cylindrical necks, and may range in color from translucent (hyaline) to pale brownish- yellow. They are typically 40 by 10.5 µm, although they may occasionally be larger—up to 142 by 18 by 8 µm. Cystidia in the gill edge—the cheilocystidia—are similar in appearance to the pleurocystidia. The hyphae of G. sulciceps have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. Biochemistry Alpha-amanitin is the chief toxin in this species Galerina sulciceps is deadly poisonous; one author opines it to be \\"perhaps the most toxic mushroom known to man\\", while later studies of toxin concentrations in amanitin-containing mushrooms corroborate this view. The symptoms of poisoning attributed to the mushroom have been noted to be relatively unusual: a local anesthesic effect, \\"pins and needles\\" sensation, and nausea without vomiting. Although these clinical symptoms are inconsistent with those of amatoxin poisoning, the presence of α-, β- and γ- amanitins in this species has been verified with chromatographic analysis. Amatoxins damage the liver and kidney by binding irreversibly to RNA polymerase II. Three separate instances of poisoning in Indonesia involved 18 people, 14 of which died. Based on this set of occurrences, death occurs in 7–51 hours \\"unless the patient survives, which seems to depend on the quantity eaten and the vigor of the individual.\\" Another death attributed to this mushroom was reported in Germany in the early 1980s. Severe poisonings have been treated with complete blood dialysis or liver transplants. Habitat and distribution This species grows on dead wood in tropical locales like Indonesia (Java and Sumatra), and near India (Sri Lanka), where it is prolific in some areas. It is not found in North America. In Germany, it has been found growing in greenhouses, and is known in the vernacular as the Gewächshaus-Häubling, meaning \\"greenhouse Galerina\\". In one instance, the mushroom was discovered fruiting in dense groups in pots of orchids standing on moist conifer sawdust.

The syndrome has its name from Dr. Lorraine (Lori) Potocki and Dr. Lisa Shaffer who discovered the deletion on the 11th chromosome and studied the impacts. The deletion of this combination of genes results in several distinctive congenital features, occasional defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract. The disorder is associated with an enlarged parietal foramina which can cause openings in the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. These abnormal openings form extra \\"soft spots\\" on the head, in addition to the two that newborns normally have, and unlike the usual newborn soft spots, the enlarged parietal foramina remain open throughout life. Other signs can include multiple mostly noncancerous benign bone tumours called osteochondromas (exostosis), developmental delay, vision disorders and craniofacial abnormalities. It is classified as a rare disease. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of Potocki–Shaffer syndrome vary widely. In addition to multiple osteochondromas and enlarged parietal foramina, affected individuals often have intellectual disability and delayed development of speech, motor skills (such as sitting and walking), and social skills. Many people with this condition have distinctive facial features, which can include a wide, short skull (brachycephaly); a prominent forehead; a narrow bridge of the nose; a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum); and a downturned mouth. Less commonly, Potocki–Shaffer syndrome causes vision problems, additional skeletal abnormalities, and defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.  Genetics  Potocki–Shaffer syndrome follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means a deletion of genetic material from one copy of chromosome 11 is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from an affected parent. More commonly, the condition results from a deletion that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Diagnosis Potocki–Shaffer syndrome can be detected through array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Management Some symptoms can be managed with drug therapy, surgery and rehabilitation, genetic counselling, and palliative care.

In addition, there is a special program for kids entering 11th grade only called Kibbutz, where the campers spend four weeks living in the garden and learning about simple, pioneer style living that is common on a kibbutz in Israel. The counselor-in- training program is the place from which JCA gets most of its staff members. The counselors in training, all entering their senior years of high school, participate in a 5-week intensive program in which they do workshops in child development, Jewish programming, and leadership training to which they become sufficient to joining the other JCA staff members. The counselors in training have the opportunity, within those 5 weeks, to work with younger campers and learn about how to be an effective counselor and leader. This incredible program has been deemed a favorite by many who attend camp. It's an enriching and exciting experience, one generally embarked by former campers of JCA. This is the perfect way of giving back to camp. Camp JCA Shalom is also a popular filming location.

Established on January 24, 1978, this battalion was headquartered in Los Palos, East Timor now Timor-Leste. One of the accomplishments of this battalion was participation in the ambush that killed the President of Fretilin, Nicolau Lobato in January 1979. The raid was conducted jointly with Kopassus troops under the command of Prabowo Subianto. Once out of the Unitary Republic of Indonesia over East Timor, the Battalion and its achievements recorded in operation to the Security Pengacau Movement (GPK) East Timor, its existence is maintained by the Regional Commander of Udayana (then) Maj.

The town was founded in 1539 by Jiří z Šlejnic, therefore it was entrusted to the protection of St. George and was named after its patron. The Czech name was created in 1949 from the name of Jiří according to older Czech geographic names. After 1945 the town was called Saint Jiretin for a short period of time. In 1949 the town got a distinction under Jedla for differentiation from the other Jiřetínů. History In 1983, The Garden of House No. 212 states that the oldest evidence of a man's stay in Jiřetín. The commemorative coin of Roman Emperor Claudius Gothicus, who ruled between 268 and 270, was founded and casted as Quintillus. Reflections on the Slavic settlement of this region since the end of the 6th century are merely fiction, and have no real basis. In 1509 King Vladislaus II gave the town the right to exploit gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, and iron for twenty years. Mining attempts were first carried out in the Sýkoří valley below Tolštejn and in the Milířka pod Kozím Valley in the Lower Podluží cadastral area. City Foundation The oldest documents of settlement around Jiřetín are medieval glassworks. The closest dated glassworks are located 1.5 km south of the village of Lesné on the Dolní Podluží cadastral area. Others are located in the middle of the Rozhled settlement opposite the resort of Slovan. The existence of the ironworks was dated to the end of the 13th century. According to available data, Jiřetín was founded in 1539, when a place was selected, and from 1548 to 1553 the mining town was set to a regular chessboard Floor plan. The town was built on an old Leipzig road that lined the eastern edge of the small town. The town of Jiřetín belongs to a group of upper towns, founded along the Saxony border. The base of Jiřetín is the exact square of the square from which the regular orthogonal network of streets unfolded. Central streets did not have a transit character, which was not at the expense of transportation availability. The long distance route was on the eastern edge of the city. Along the square and the streets were square quadratic blocks, each of which had three houses. Although all the houses in the town were wooden, it was never completely destroyed for this reason. Church in Jiřetín pod Jedlovou at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries Square in Jiřetín pod Jedlovou at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries The initial development of the town was influenced by the numerous advantages that arose from the founding privilege put together by Jiří z Šlejnic on November 12, 1554. The city had the usual basic rights; all homeowners were given the right to brew beer and sell it according to the Rumburk Brewing right, the right to care for, bread, and slaughter cattle, the freedom to trade and manage craft. They have been freed from all other Dominion and Customs. They had the right to vote for the city council, Purkmistr, and city government officials, even though the nobility insisted on their approval. The inhabitants of the city did not receive any land, only those on which their houses stood. However, they had the right to a free reference of their property and, above all, the privilege of free movement, which meant they had the right to leave and return to Jiřetín. The privileges allowed a successful urban life to ensure successful mining. The main mining work in the 16th century was the hereditary adit of Saint Christopher, its entrance can be seen in front of the house of Jiřetín No. 252 in Křížová Street. The support of the authority was not limitless, a conditional extension of the mining privilege was envisaged. The privilege was extended in 1569 for another 15 years and in 1584 for another three years. Soon, however, mining fell. At the time of limiting mining activities, the estate was property of the law. In 1587, the inhabitants of the town were subject to salaries and duties. On December 18, 1587, the town was granted privileges by Emperor Rudolf II. The city's privileges included two annual markets, St. George (April 24), and St. Martin's (November 11). In 1599, a plague epidemic broke out in the city, which killed 300 people. The church was built by the town's people of Jiřetín in 1587. The church was consecrated on 21 May 1612 and the first clergyman Joachim Schöfelder, the evangelical pastor of Dolní Podluží, became the first clergyman. In 1616, the priest moved from Dolní Podluží to Jiřetín. Hopes and prayers for ore deposits did not meet expectations. The path to life security led to guilds. In 1642, during the Thirty Years' War, the Swedes destroyed the nearby Tolštejn Castle. At the time of the re-Catholicization, according to the list of December 3, 1652, 108 people left from Jiřetín, Johann Krocker was the first to receive civic law in Dresden. Thirty Years' War to 1945 St. Lawrence in the square of Jiřetín pod Jedlovou Until the issue of the imperial patent on July 19, 1765, the city used high justice rights. The execution site was on Šibeniční hill. After the Thirty Years' War, there were 29 desolate houses from 92 houses in Jiřetín. In 1656, Jiriethin's pastor stated that mines of gold, silver, copper, and also coal were put into operation. In 1750, the mining of ores was carried out in the hereditary cathedral of Saint Christopher on the Cross Mountain, in 1781 Štola Jan Evangelista was built. In 1681 he bought the rumby estate of Prince Anton Florian from Liechtenstein, whose family shared the destiny of Jiřetín until 1919. In 1804, after the destruction of the manipulation building, the ore had to be weighed into Saxon Freiberg, which was very wasteful, so the mining did not continue. The land Jedlová worked in the early 18th century Baroque glassworks. In 1805, the road used today was built over the Stožecké saddle. The junction under Jiřetín carries the unofficial name Na Mýtě, probably to prove that the old trade route, which led to toll collection in Tolštejn, was conducted here. In 1848 a national guard was formed in Jiřetín. In 1907, with regards to the reformation of the public administration, the abolition of the estate and the establishment of districts, it became part of the Rumburk district, later in the district of Varnsdorf. Since 1862 there has been a post office in Jiřetín. Josef Vítězslav Šimák wrote about Jiřetín pod Jedlovou: > \\"Hory Jiřetínské kvetly však jen za požehnaného míru doby Rudolfinské, > válkou třicetiletou zanikly a nevzkřísily se, ač pokusy o to dály se. Teprve > nový průmysl, tkalcovský a soukenický, zvláště výroba sametů, potom > sklářství, zavedené sem ta tišších dob ze sousedství, pomohl městečku a je > dosud hlavním zdrojem výživy.\\" > > \\"The Jiřetínské Mountains bloomed, however, only for the blessed peace of > the Rudolfinian period, the Thirty Years' War ceased and the thought did not > pass, although there were attempts to do so.

After the mid-19th century, due to diversion of the main road, and in relation to industrial and building development near Varnsdorf, Jiřetín stopped their Floor plan development. Only two buildings were built; the Shoreline building at the foot of the Cross Mountain, and the firearms building just next to it. At the beginning of the 20th century a new waterworks system was built. On September 8, 1909, electricity was introduced in Jiřetín. During the First World War, 71 South Moravian natives were killed. Demography Population According to the census, on 1 November 1980, 773 people lived in Jiřetín pod Jedlovou, of whom 296 were men and 477 were women. The unusual ratio of men and women was caused by the fact that in Jiřetín there was a charity home for the religious, and there were also housed workers from Poland. A total of 543 citizens reported their Czech nationality, 140 Slovak, 72 German, 10 Polish, 5 Hungarian, and 3 Ukrainian. According to the census in 2001, Jiřetín pod Jedlovou had 570 inhabitants, of which 484 had Czech nationalities, 30 German, 25 Slovak and one citizen applied for Moravian nationality.

However, there are also differences in some of the basic pronunciation patterns between the standard dialects of each country. The standard varieties for each are in fact generalizations: for the U.S., a loosely defined spectrum of unmarked varieties called General American (abbreviated \\"GA\\") and, for Britain, a collection of prestigious varieties most common in southeastern England, ranging from upper- to middle-class Received Pronunciation accents (often classified along a continuum with local Estuary English),Moreno Falcón, Manuel. (2016). Received Pronunciation, Estuary English and Cockney: a study focused on l-vocalisation, th-fronting and t-glottaling. 10.13140/RG.2.1.2286.7444. which together here are abbreviated \\"RP\\". However, other regional accents in each country also show differences, for which see regional accents of English speakers. Received Pronunciation has been the subject of many academic studies, and is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners. The widely repeated claim that only about two percent of Britons speak RP is no more than a rough estimate and has been questioned by several writers, most notably by the phonetician J. Windsor Lewis. Phonological differences * Rhoticity - GA is rhotic while RP is non-rhotic; that is, the phoneme is only pronounced in RP when it is immediately followed by a vowel sound. Where GA pronounces before a consonant and at the end of an utterance, RP either has no consonant (if the preceding vowel is , or , as in bore, burr and bar) or has a schwa instead (the resulting sequences being diphthongs or triphthongs). This leads to several RP mergers characteristic of non-rhotic accents, whereas GA maintains these distinctions. Similarly, where GA has r-colored vowels ( or , as in \\"cupboard\\" or \\"bird\\"), RP has plain vowels or . The \\"intrusive R\\" of many RP speakers (in such sequences as \\"the idea-r-of it\\") is absent in GA; this is a consequence of the rhotic/non-rhotic distinction. * The trap–bath split has resulted in RP having the back unrounded open vowel in many words where GA has a front open unrounded vowel ; this RP vowel occurs typically (but not always) when followed by: **, , , , , or (e.g. aunt, pass, laugh, path). *Several foreign names and loanwords spelled with use in RP but in GA, such as kebab, pasta, macho, and taco. In a small number of words, these phonemes are exactly reversed in the two dialects, such as banana, khaki, and Pakistan. * RP has three open back vowels, where GA has only two or even one. GA speakers use for both the RP (spot) and (spa): the father–bother merger. ** Nearly half of American speakers additionally use the same vowel for the RP (the cot–caught merger). * While the lot–cloth split is not usually found in RP, it is found in those GA speakers who do not have the cot–caught merger (which otherwise neutralizes this split). This results in in some words which now have in RP, particularly before voiceless fricatives and sometimes before (where it is always in RP, both older and contemporary). This is reflected in the \\"eye dialect\\" spelling \\"dawg\\" for dog. * \\"Long o\\" and \\"short o\\" before intervocalic /r/ have merged in American English. Thus \\"moral\\" and \\"oral\\" rhymes in GA (), while in RP they do not rhyme, being pronounced and , respectively. * RP has a marked degree of contrast of length between \\"short\\" and \\"long\\" vowels (the long vowels being the diphthongs plus , , , , and ). In GA this contrast is somewhat less evident and non-phonemic, so the IPA length symbol () is often omitted. * The \\"long o\\" (as in boat) is realised differently: GA back first element ; RP central first element . However, there is considerable variation in this vowel on both sides of the Atlantic. * The distinction between unstressed and is lost in GA, while in RP it is retained. Thus in RP, edition and addition are not homophones. * Where GA has in an unstressed syllable at the end of a morpheme, conservative RP has , not having undergone happy- tensing. This distinction is retained in inflected forms (e.g. candied and candid are homophones in RP, but not in GA). * In GA, flapping is common: when either a or a occurs between a sonorant phoneme and an unstressed vowel phoneme, it is realized as an alveolar-flap allophone . This sounds like a to RP speakers. is an allophone of in conservative RP, which is hence caricatured in America as a \\"veddy British\\" accent. The degree of flapping varies considerably among speakers, and is often reduced in more formal settings. It does occur to an extent in nearly all speakers of American English, with better pronounced with a flap almost ubiquitously regardless of background. Pronouncing the t would be considered overly formal. This does not mean it always completely merges with bedder, as in the latter can be somewhat longer than in better. * Yod-dropping occurs in GA at the onset of stressed syllables after all alveolar consonants, including ; i.e. historic (from spellings u, ue, eu, ew), is pronounced . In contrast, RP speakers: ** always retain after : e.g. new is RP , GA ; ** retain or coalesce it after : e.g. due is RP or , GA ; ** retain or drop it after : e.g. allude is RP or (as GA) . ** retain, coalesce or drop it after : e.g. assume is RP , or (as GA) ; *Yod-coalescence occur in both GA and RP in unstressed syllables or after a stressed vowel. RP however more often retains the yod, especially in carefully enunciated forms of words. For example, issue is RP or (as GA) , graduate may be carefully enunciated in RP as , but nature is always coalesced . In both GA and RP, however, the sounds of word-final , , , and (spelled either s or z) can coalesce with the sound of word-initial (spelled u or y) in casual or rapid speech, becoming , , , and respectively, thus this year ( can sound like thi(s) shear/sheer. This is also found in other English accents. * For some RP speakers (upper class), unlike in GA, some or all of tyre (tire), tower, and tar are homophones; this reflects the merger of the relevant vowels. * The voiceless stops /t/, /p/, and /k/ have a stronger aspiration in RP. * Most General American accents, but not British ones, have undergone vowels mergers before /r/: the nearer–mirror and hurry–furry mergers, and some variation of the Mary–marry–merry merger, a total three-way merger being the most common throughout North America. * GA accents usually have some degree of merging weak vowels. * Vowels differ slightly in the two dialects (consult the International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects). * Disyllabic laxing is more common in American than in British English, with a short vowel in GA and a long vowel in RP in such words as era, patent and lever. * Trisyllabic laxing however is somewhat less common in GA than in RP, for example in privacy and vitamin.

The film stars RK, Bhama, Vadivelu, Raghuvaran, Manivannan, Ashish Vidhyarthi, Manoj Jayan in a modern-day vigilante story.\\"Ellam Avan Seyal - Justice prevails \\", The film is a remake of the 2006 Malayalam-language film Chinthamani Kolacase. Plot The basic premise is of a lawyer doling out his brand of justice on criminals whom he himself had freed from the courts. The story is centered on Laxman Kumar alias LK (RK), an enigmatic yet renowned criminal lawyer with an even more enigmatic mission. LK helps out hardened criminals to get away from court by lying that there is no proof of their crimes. But later, he pursues and takes them out in a bizarre show of vigilante justice. It was then that the case of Mirchi Girls, a band of spoilt, rich NRI girls, reaches him. A parallel narration is the comedy track of Vandu Murugan (Vadivelu). Vandu Murugan is a lawyer who does not know to argue in the cases. He lands in trouble when the convicts accuse him, and he is thrown in jail. Frustrated, he becomes a politician who lands in hilarious situations and makes us laugh. Mirchi Girls are the main accused in the murder of Chinthamani (Bhama), their college mate, an innocent girl from a conservative background. Veeramani (Manivannan), her old father, is fighting hard for justice and is represented by Advocate Anbukarasu (Ashish Vidhyarthi), a public prosecutor who is famous for his unique style of argument. After a long court battle, LK succeeds in bringing the judgement in favor of Mirchi Girls. He finds out that it was none other than Anbukarasu and the college principal David Williams (Manoj Jayan), who committed Chinthamani's murder. Chintamani was sent to David's house, but she was locked in a room there and made to have sex with him. Then, Anbukarasu interferes, locks the door, and rapes her all day. Covered in lust, she is killed by them after they rape her for hours. LK, in his own violent way kills David and Anbukarasu to deliver justice to Chinthamani and Veeramani.

Soundtrack Critical reception Sify noted \\"The problem with Shaji Kailas's Ellam Avan Seyal a remake of his own Chintamani Kolacase is its non-happening, unbelievable and infantile script which is dark and dreary\\".http://www.sify.com/movies/ellam-avan-seyal-review-tamil- pclwPhihaddcg.html Hindu wrote \\"Depending entirely on a strong story and his narrative skill, Shaji Kailas keeps you quite engrossed with Ellam Avan Seyal\\".http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/winning- point-ellam-avan-seyal/article3023613.ece Behindwoods wrote \\"The script (credited to Shaji Kailas) is taut, but also demands unwavering attention, barring which you might feel that the person is being murdered twice by different people. The movie does not keep you on tenterhooks throughout, which must ideally be the case for a thriller, but it does not bore you too\\".http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-reviews/reviews-2/ellam-avan- seyal.html References External links * Category:2008 films Category:Indian vigilante films Category:Tamil remakes of Malayalam films Category:Indian films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Films featuring an item number ","title":"Ellam Avan Seyal"},{"id":"24127711","text":"Libotenice is a village and municipality (obec) in Litoměřice District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic.

History  Ploskovice, former Ploschkowitz Castle Duchess Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg (1672 – 1741) had sprawling estates in the region, including the castle of Ploskovice, acquired by her father in 1663. She was very wealthy, and brought a possible claim to the Duchy of Saxe- Lauenburg through her father Duke Julius Francis.Paul Strathern, The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance, London: Vintage books, 2003, pp. 397 – 398. Through their possessions the ducal family also belonged to the Bohemian nobility. In 1697, the Duchess married Gian Gastone de' Medici, who later became Grand Duke of Tuscany. They lived in the castle of Ploskovice. Anna Maria Franziska dominated her weak husband, which drove him into the arms of alcohol. He deplored her behaviour, \\"capriciousness, peevish faces and sharp words\\". Gian Gastone stayed with his wife for a mere ten months, before fleeing to Prague. The Tuscan grand duchess refused to come to Tuscany, despite her husband's constant protestations. She believed that the Medici were in the habit of murdering their consorts.Paul Strathern, The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance, London: Vintage books, 2003, p. 403.

All sequence variants found in individuals are collected in the database, together with information about whether they could be causally connected to the disease (i.e. a disease-causing variant or mutation) or not (i.e. a non-disease causing variant). Specialized doctors (clinical geneticists) use LOVDs to diagnose and advise patients carrying a genetic disease. Ideally, if a patient has been screened for mutations and one has been found, information in LOVD can predict the progress of the disease. In contrast to human genome databases, showing information on all DNA variants, LOVDs include information about the individuals in which the variants were found. This patient information is usually only accessible for registered users. Currently, LOVD installations worldwide contain more than 515,500 variant observations (124,000 unique variants in 5175 genes) in 162,000 patients.List of public LOVD installations, last visited 2013-03-08  Background  As the human genome project has completed, the collection and study of all sequence variation between individuals is of increasing importance to understand the relationship between DNA variations and disease. Direct access to up-to-date information on sequence variation is currently provided most efficiently through web-based, gene-centered, locus-specific databases (LSDBs). While over 1600 of these LSDBs exist online,List of all known locus-specific databases (LSDBs) by The Waystation , last visited 2013-03-08 sharing information or combining data of these databases is extremely hard if they are not software-based or use custom software.

The LOVD software was developed to create an \\"LSDB-in-a-Box\\". It should allow the easy creation and maintenance of a gene sequence variation database using the internet. LOVD is platform-independent and uses PHP and MySQL open source software only. The gene-centered design of the database follows the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) and focuses on ease of use and flexibility. The newest LOVD version, released late 2012, also allows to process Next-generation sequencing data, which often results in large numbers of variants found in between genes as well. To ensure the use of unambiguous sequence variant descriptions in newly submitted data, LOVD interacts with Mutalyzer, which applies the HGVS human nomenclature guidelines to check and, if necessary, correct sequence variant descriptions.

Now Australia’s oldest and longest running eisteddfod, it has seen over one million aspiring singers, dancers, orators, writers, musicians and composers pass through its doors. As the Eisteddfod grows, it continues to be one of Ballarat’s major draw cards and contributes over $14 million a year to the local economy through the support of the Ballarat community of sponsors and of 240 volunteers. The Competitions, which run from July to October, offer 12 different theatrical disciplines to young performers including speech and drama, singing, music, dance and calisthenics. The Society was granted “Royal” status in 1962 for services to the community and was recently honoured with five community service awards. The Royal South Street Society is a not-for-profit organisation and is reliant on a small team of office staff, nine Board members and 240 volunteers to organise the annual event. The entry and admission fees only cover 50% of production costs.  History  From humble beginnings in 1879 as an informal debating group, the Royal South Street Society has grown to become the largest performing arts competition in Australia. The Young Men’s General Debating Society was initiated by eight scholars of the Central State Night School, with the intention of ‘refining manners, cultivating the mind and stimulating the intellect.’ They met on a weekly basis in a cottage belonging to the mother of their first president, William D. Hill, at 31 South Street, Ballarat. The Society quickly grew in popularity, and by the early 1880s, a number of similar groups had also been established. In 1882, these individual societies formed a collective body called the Ballarat and District Mutual Improvement Associations Union. The Union held its first annual competition on 30 March 1883, at the Alfred Hall in Grenville Street North. The program included music, elocution, essays, poetry and debates. Prizes included gold and silver medals, certificates and money amounting to £30 (close to $4,000 in today’s currency). Although the Union collapsed in 1889, there was still enough interest from the local community to conduct further performance-based competitions. The inaugural Grand Annual Eisteddfod of Australasia was held in the Society’s new Skipton Street Hall on 16 June 1891. Over ten days, 260 entrants competed for prizes totalling £63 (worth almost $8,000 today). The presentation ceremony was chaired by Ballarat’s Mayor Shoppee, and Victorian Governor Lord Hopetoun awarded the prizes. The Honourable Alfred Deakin gave a speech in which he congratulated the Society on their progress and expressed ‘the desirability of making their efforts the basis for still greater things.’  Venues  When the Royal South Street Society outgrew its original base at 31 South Street, other buildings were sought to meet the needs of competitors and audiences. In 1886, a block of land at 115 Skipton Street was purchased to establish a new hall, with seating for up to 1,000 people. It was later relocated to Grenville Street in 1907, and renamed the Athenaeum. In the same year, the 10,000 seat Coliseum theatre was constructed on the adjoining lot, and was opened in August 1908 by Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. For 28 years, the Coliseum was the central venue for the South Street Competitions, until it was destroyed by a fire on 24 March 1936. In 1965, the RSSS purchased Her Majesty’s Theatre in Lydiard Street. Her Majesty’s is the oldest working theatre in Australia, and has been in operation since 1875. After renaming it the Memorial Theatre, the Royal South Street Society managed the building until 1987, when they returned ownership to the City of Ballarat. Refurbishments began in 1988, with $5 million provided by the Victorian Government in partnership with $4 million raised by the Ballarat community. The re-christened Her Majesty’s was launched with a gala evening in 1990. Other key venues used by the RSSS throughout its history include: * Alfred Hall * Mechanics Institute * Civic Hall * William Booth Hal * Founders Hall * St Paul’s Hall * Dawson Street Hall * Old Gaol and Court House * Wendouree Performing Arts Centre * Diocesan Hall of Christ Church * Wesley Church Hall * Ballarat Special School * Wilkinson Hall * Learning Exchange (old YMCA) * Bridge Hotel Car Park * City Oval * Ballarat and Clarendon College * Lake Wendouree Foreshore  Volunteers  From its inception, the Royal South Street Society has been generously supported by volunteers of all ages and backgrounds. Today, there are more than 250 dedicated unpaid helpers, including a Board of nine members. Each and every one of these volunteers plays a role in ensuring the smooth running of all events over the 14 weeks of competition. Some days this can mean in up to 80 volunteers are rostered to facilitate running the sessions. In 2014, the volunteers contributed about 18,000 hours of volunteered time. > \\"I have been a part of South Street for 36 years and a volunteer for 14 > years.

Her Majesty's Theatre is naturally at the top of this list. Volunteers are stage managers, discipline chairpersons, masters of ceremonies, curtain operators, timers, runners, security officers, technical support (like music coordination), front of house ushers, door persons, writers, ticket sellers, board members and more.  Supporters  As a non- profit organisation, the Royal South Street Society draws its income from two main sources: firstly, from competition entry and admission fees; and secondly from advertising and sponsorship deals. Since its inception in 1891, the Royal South Street Society has enjoyed the support of a wide variety of financial partnerships. These have come from diverse backgrounds, from small businesses to larger corporations; from individuals to families. Each sponsor determines the nature of their involvement, be it supporting a specific discipline or the competitions as a whole. Throughout its long history, the Royal South Street Society has had a number of different financial supporters. From 1903, there was a steady growth in figures until the Great Depression struck in 1933. During this time, the Royal South Street Society not only retained its existing partnerships, but also added 78 new sponsors, of which 25 were for music, singing and vocal teachers. The number of advertisers and sponsors declined during World War II (1939 – 1945), but slowly increased again by 1949. The nature of advertising has changed a great deal over the last two centuries. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, advertisements in Royal South Street Society publications featured general products as varied as toiletries, corsetry, furnishings, drapery, motor vehicles, bicycles, confectionery, Chinese medicine and musical instruments. Businesses today prefer to target their promotions towards specific markets. For the Royal South Street Society in the twenty-first century, this includes dance schools, calisthenic clubs, restaurants, accommodation, and schools at primary, secondary and tertiary level. The Royal South Street Society could not have survived and flourished without the assistance of its many loyal supporters, and continues to rely on their generosity today.  Royal South Street Society Success Stories  Since 1891, thousands of people have participated in the RSSS Competitions, and many have progressed to have successful careers in the performing arts.

The municipality covers an area of 11.85 square kilometres and has a population of 918 as of 2013. Tisá lies approximately north of Ústí nad Labem and north of Prague and south of borders with Germany. The village is situated in 548 – 550 meters above sea level. History Around the year of 500 a group of the Slavs came to the village. The origin of the name is from the Czech word \\"tis\\", meaning yew. In the 14th century the Vantenberks usurped an extensive area around Tetschen () and built a stronghold named Šenov. Under the region of knights of Bünau () there was a major economic expansion. In 1554 – 1557 Günter I developed a castle with a Lutheran church, presbytery, school, brewery and the name of the village was changed due to the castle into Schönstein. In 1631 Croatians and Swedes burned all of the objects in Tisá and Schönstein. In 1750 several factories were built, and the city became a cradle of the button industry. Today the municipal office of Tisá administers two other villages, Ostrov and Rájec. Since 1998 their coat of arms has been represented by three small yew branches. Nature Tyssa Walls Tisá and neighbouring villages are protected by CHKO Labské pískovce (Conservation area of Elbe sandstones). There is a part of an extensive sandstone plateau that originated about 90 million years ago in the Cretaceous Mesozoic period. When the sea covering the northern part of the country retreated, it left layers of sandstone sediments cemented with kaolin, clay and other materials. Of note is Tyssaer Wände (). There are 113 registered climbing routes, a number of bicycle or cross-country skiing ways. Places of interest *St Anne’s Church is situated in the centre of the village. This Baroque building was built in 1789. In the frontage of the east tower there are two cast-iron bells from 1922 made by steelmaker from Chabařovice Arnold-Kress and a small bell from 1859 by Harold Francis of Litoměřice (). *Chapel *Crucifix of conciliation is placed by the road between Libouchec and Nový Libouchec. On both sides of the wedge-shaped sandstone the year of 1626 has been engraved. It reminds of the time and place of an itinerant quack’s violent death.

Duchaussois is most noted for his autobiographical novel Flash ou le Grand Voyage.  Biography  Born 27 January 1940 to diplomats, he was hit in the eye by shrapnel during a morning air raid when he was 4 months and 8 days old. This left him blind in one eye, a detail often evoked in his novels. In his 20s, he decided to leave for the south of France after getting fed up with the Île-de-France. After various thefts, frauds, and multiple trips to prison, he left for Lebanon to meet a friend. This is where \\"Flash ou le grand voyage\\" starts. It was 1969 at the zenith of the hippie movement, from Marseille to Beirut, from Istanbul to Baghdad, taking long detours in India, by boat, on foot, in car, Charles bit by bit got closer to Kathmandu, the height of drugs and hippies. His trip began by accident in Lebanon, with arms and hashish tradings. His destination was Kathmandu. His trip was groundbreaking from a geographical perspective but also from the sheer number of drugs he discovered. He went deep into drug addiction, offering the reader not only a look at his exploits but also his challenges. He was medically repatriated to Paris on 10 January 1970, after six months of progressive and near total descent into hell. The end of his trip touches insanity, Charles escaping death several times at the last minute. Upon his return, he recorded the tale of his adventure on 18 magnetic tapes and sent it to Fayard publishing house in December 1970., Insanity, death & excess, it was the decade. This psychedelic novel gives us a clear and sometimes crazy insider's look at hippie wave of the 60s. After \\"Flash\\" : Until November 1970, he struggles with drug addiction, helped by Jocelyne, a French woman he met at Kathmandu. Charles and Jocelyne don't escape from the world of drugs, working odd jobs, raiding Parisian pharmacies, going insane and then to detox. At the beginning of 1971, they moved to Switzerland, to La Chaux-de-Fonds. 3 November 1971, their son Krishna-Romain was born. The name was in honor of a servant Charles had in Kathmandu and a friend of Charles who settled in Kuwait. At the beginning of 1972, Charles wants to travel again (in South America), but Jocelyne wants a stable life to raise Krishna-Romain. Charles left to go live in Paris. He remarried in 1974 to Christiane, and had a baby girl: V. They separated in 1977. At the end of 1978, tragedy struck, Charles was imprisoned for homicide. Divorced in 1983, he met Fernanda and remarried for the third time in the Paris region. They divorced in 1986. Charles Duchaussois died of lung cancer 27 February 1991 at the hospital Saint-Michel in Paris. Monsieur S., funeral director recognized him and let him be entombed in the Valenton intermunicipal cemetery. He rests in an unmarked grave with two brothers at his side.

The album features a concert performance by Taylor with Thurman Barker, William Parker, Carlos Ward and Leroy Jenkins. The Allmusic review by Stacia Proefrock states \\"One look at this recording and anyone familiar with the work of Cecil Taylor will know that it isn't for the faint of heart or spirit. An unbroken, hurricane of an album that extends for more than 71 minutes, Live in Vienna begins with a multi-voice poetry performance that descends into glossolalia and clucks, reminding the listener of the heyday of the Four Horsemen... Listening to this recording (and most certainly attending the performance that gave birth to it) might best be viewed as a ritual of endurance and cerebral submission. This is not meant as criticism, but the listener who fails to completely surrender to the music on Live in Vienna will most certainly be beaten bloody by the force of Cecil Taylor's work\\".Proefrock, S.

Merriam Co. The game is quite similar to the game of Bouillotte, but it is not played anymore. History The game of Brelan, even ', for the name and the rules varied over time, also appears in an edict of Lille, France, of 1458. In Crébillon's 1763 novel \\"Le Hasard du coin du feu\\", the game of \\"Brelan\\" takes centre stage. It is often considered as sharing roots with a Renaissance game of Primero and Primo visto. The game is recorded as Treschaken in a Holstein dialect dictionary in 1802 where it is equated to the French bréland. In England, Brelan eventually developed into the game of Brag, also Bragg, where the possibility of bluffing is an important part of the game. It evidently derived from the game of Brelan and later evolved into Bouillotte, which flourished during the French Revolution. Most experts believe that all these earlier card games played an important part in the formation of modern Poker, the most famous representative of a very ancient and always very popular family of games, all of which can be traced even further back to the old French game of Gilet (Gillet, Gile or Trionfetti),Schaum's outline of French vocabulary, pg. 322 Mary E. Coffman Crocker 1997 which may be considered the most ancient European ancestor of Poker. The game Brelan is played by three, four or five players, with a 32-card pack,Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 37 each receiving 3 cards and a fourth turned from the stock. The best hand is a brelan carre, or four of a kind, made with the aid of the turn-up card on the table, followed by a simple brelan or prial. Brelan favori is a pair royal composed of 2 cards in the hand and the card turned. In Brelan Cavé,Académie universelle des jeux, ou, Dictionnaire méthodique et raisonné de jeu, pg. 57 Charles Yves Cousin d'Avallon, 3rd. ed. 1842 the game is limited to a certain number of rounds, the bouillotte, on the contrary, lasts as long as there are players in the game who still have not lost their stakes.

This secondary structure prevents the degradation of the iscR mRNA. The iscRSUA operon encodes for the proteins required in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis where the expression of this operon is regulated by RyhB and iscR, a transcription repressor. Under sufficient iron conditions RyhB binds to iscRSUA mRNA and promotes the degradation of the mRNA located downstream of iscR. Scanning the intergenic regions of this polycistronic mRNA and using Mfold software a secondary structure was predicted within the intergenic region between iscR and iscS and later confirmed by lead acetate probing. Mutations that disrupt this secondary structure resulted in the degradation of iscR mRNA after RyhB binding. 3′ RACE analysis of the iscR mRNA fragment identified the intergenic RNA at the 3′ end. These results suggest that this intergenic RNA element acts as an iscR mRNA stability element by protecting iscR from exonuclease degradation.

It was intended to track entities using communication methods such as cell phones and e-mail. NSA employees J. Kirk Wiebe, William Binney, Ed Loomis, and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffer Diane Roark complained to the Department of Defense's Inspector General (IG) about waste, fraud, and abuse in the program, and the fact that a successful operating prototype existed. The complaint was accepted by the IG and an investigation began that lasted until mid-2005 when the final results were issued. The results were largely hidden, as the report given to the public was heavily (90%) redacted, while the original report was heavily classified, thus restricting the ability of most people to see it. The people who filed the IG complaint were later raided by armed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents. While the Government threatened to prosecute all who signed the IG report, it ultimately chose to pursue an NSA Senior Executive Thomas Andrews Drake who helped with the report internally to NSA and who had spoken with a reporter about the project. Drake was later charged under the Espionage Act of 1917. His defenders claimed this was retaliation. The charges against him were later dropped, and he agreed to plead guilty to having committed a misdemeanor under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, something that Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project (which helped represent him) called an \\"act of civil disobedience\\".  Background  Trailblazer was chosen over a similar program named ThinThread, a less costly project which had been designed with built-in privacy protections for United States citizens. Trailblazer was later linked to the NSA electronic surveillance program and the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. In 2002 a consortium led by Science Applications International Corporation was chosen by the NSA to produce a technology demonstration platform in a contract worth $280 million. Project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton. The project was overseen by NSA Deputy Director William B. Black, Jr., an NSA worker who had gone to SAIC, and then been re-hired back to NSA by NSA director Michael Hayden in 2000. SAIC had also hired a former NSA director to its management: Bobby Inman.Bamford, Shadow Factory, Doubleday, 2008, p201 SAIC also participated in the concept definition phase of Trailblazer.

The NSA Inspector General issued a report on Trailblazer that \\"discussed improperly based contract cost increases, non- conformance in the management of the Statement of Work, and excessive labor rates for contractor personnel.\\" In 2004 the DoD IG report criticized the program (see the Whistleblowing section below). It said that the \\"NSA 'disregarded solutions to urgent national security needs'\\" and \\"that TRAILBLAZER was poorly executed and overly expensive ...\\" Several contractors for the project were worried about cooperating with DoD's audit for fear of \\"management reprisal.\\" The Director of NSA \\"nonconcurred\\" with several statements in the IG audit, and the report contains a discussion of those disagreements.See the IG report, linked in the article. In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule. In 2006 the program was shut down, after having cost billions of US Dollars.Government Accountability Project website , accessed June 9, 2013. Several anonymous NSA sources told Newsweek later on that the project was a \\"wasteful failure\\". The new project replacing Trailblazer is called Turbulence.  Whistleblowing  According to a 2011 New Yorker article, in the early days of the project several NSA employees met with Diane S Roark, an NSA budget expert on the House Intelligence Committee. They aired their grievances about Trailblazer. In response, NSA director Michael Hayden sent out a memo saying that \\"individuals, in a session with our congressional overseers, took a position in direct opposition to one that we had corporately decided to follow ... Actions contrary to our decisions will have a serious adverse effect on our efforts to transform N.S.A., and I cannot tolerate them.\\" In September 2002, several people filed a complaint with the Department of Defense IG's office regarding problems with Trailblazer: they included Roark (aforementioned), as well as ex-NSA senior analysts Bill Binney, Kirk Wiebe, and Senior Computer Systems Analyst Ed Loomis, who had all quit the agency over concerns about its mismanagement of acquisition and allegedly illegal domestic spying. A major source for the report was NSA senior officer Thomas Andrews Drake. Drake had been complaining to his superiors for some time about problems at the agency, and about the superiority of ThinThread over Trailblazer, for example, at protecting privacy. Drake gave info to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark also went to her boss at the House committee, Porter Goss, about problems, but was rebuffed. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court Chief Justice at the time. Drake's own boss, Maureen Baginski, the third-highest officer at NSA, quit partly over concerns about the legality of its behavior. In 2003, the NSA IG (not the DoD IG) had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure. It had cost more than $1 billion. In 2005, the DoD IG produced a report on the result of its investigation of the complaint of Roark and the others in 2002. This report was not released to the public, but it has been described as very negative. Jane Mayer writes that it hastened the closure of Trailblazer, which was at the time in trouble from Congress for being over budget. In November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman, a reporter of The Baltimore Sun. Gorman wrote several articles about problems at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. This series got her an award from the Society of Professional Journalists. In 2005, President George W. Bush ordered the FBI to find whoever had disclosed information about the NSA electronic surveillance program and its disclosure in the New York Times. Eventually, this investigation led to the people who had filed the 2002 DoD IG request, even though they had nothing to do with the New York Times disclosure. In 2007, the houses of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe were raided by armed FBI agents. According to Mayer, Binney claims the FBI pointed guns at his head and that of his wife. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union. None of these people were ever charged with any crime. Four months later, Drake was raided in November 2007 and his computers and documents were confiscated. In 2010 Drake was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges of obstructing justice, providing false information, and violating the Espionage Act of 1917, part of President Barack Obama's crackdown on whistleblowers and \\"leakers\\". The government tried to get Roark to testify to a conspiracy, and made similar requests to Drake, offering him a plea bargain. They both refused. In June 2011, the ten original charges against Drake were dropped; instead he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.

There is an option to play as three characters, all who were brutally murdered by the order of the king and want revenge on him. Gameplay Plot The story follows a trio of knights: Romulus Blood (Keith Ferguson), a human knight and former head of the House of Blood who made a Faustian bargain with an unseen demon known as The Beast (Steve Blum), along with his younger brother Remus (Andrew Kashino) and Remus' wife and princess of Cavalier named Sylvia Gradis (Megan Hollingshead) while they are at the end of their lives after the entire House of Blood is slaughtered under the orders of the king Kirk Gladys (Also voiced by Steve Blum) and his charismatic, tyrannical wife Fatima (Wendy Braun). Over the course of the game, The Beast grants each of the three characters a second chance at life as necromancers with the ability to turn their still living enemies into undead soldiers. The trio first go after Duke Gloucester, a former war hero who became a corrupt glutton and fight against him. Gollaster attempted to send a demon out to kill them in a desperate attempt, but he was soon killed by the knights. The trio soon discover that as a result of the bargain with the Beast, they have started to become more demonic as they go on their path of revenge. As the story progresses, each one of the three knights goes after several individuals responsible for taking part in their deaths and soon discover a fruit known as the Fruit of the Holy Tree, a demonic fruit that turns its user into a demon. Captain Gerrard, a leader of a trio of knights who praise Fatima as a saint, uses the Fruit of the Holy Tree after finding out his daughter was killed in a battle with the Undead Knights and becomes a giant demon known as the Nephilim. In his dying words, Gerard reveals that Fatima also controls a portion of undead servants of her own, having long since forsaken the land of Cavalier for her own selfish goals. Later, the undead knights encounter various genetically engineered soldiers called Ouroboros created by the mad, egocentric wizard Lord Follis (Liam O'Brien), who attempted to convince the knights to join them, only to be told off. A battle ensues in which Follis uses the Fruit of the Holy Tree to mutate into a demon known as Venom Angel and is killed by the knights. After the battle, Fatima's younger brother the Jester (Thomas Brownhead) reveals that Romulus was the one who was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Sylvia and Remus. During the attack on the House of Blood, Romulus was one of the knights participating in the attack and was searching for the two of them in the midst of the chaos. When Kirk's knights captured them, Romulus summoned up all of his rage induced bloodlust and slaughtered everyone in his path, but accidentally killed Sylvia and Remus during his rampage. Having earned the forgiveness of Sylvia and Remus, the three knights go to finally confront The Jester, who reveals himself to be a product of Fatima's experiments with the occult. Another battle ensues and the knights succeed in killing the jester. They soon find a trio of knights whom they had killed earlier also revived into undead, defeating them in the process and ultimately kill Kirk Gradis, who had lost everything and became horrified by the uncontrollable powers Fatima had given him, but regretted ever betraying the House of Blood. In the finale, the truth of Fatima's rise to power and the dark powers she gave to her subordinates is finally revealed: Fatima herself was once a human who made a pact with The Beast in a demonic realm called The Void (eventually learning to control the blood's power to the point where she retained her current human appearance and intellect) and that the demonic power The Beast gave them was not really magic as Lord Follis had said, but it was an infection created from the Beast's blood. Fatima also reveals that she created the Holy Tree from the Beast's blood in order to get rid of humanity's fear of death and creating her own ideal world where humans are immortal and will no longer bear the burden of life. When the knights oppose her goal of creating a world of undead demons, Fatima fuses herself with the tree and becomes a demon called Yggdrasil, only to be killed by the knights. In her last breath, Fatima offers a crystallized stone made of demon blood to protect the knights from The Beast's influence, fearing that they will be hunted for what they have done in the name of vengeance. The trio soon realizes that The Beast had been using them as assassins right from the start while The Beast tells them that they are beyond redemption after all they have done. This leads them to destroy the crystal Fatima had given them in an act of defiance towards The Beast's wish of keeping them as slaves. Furious with their rebuke, The Beast warns the knights that they will die again and that they will go to hell after their deaths with the Beast saying he will \\"keep a spot nice and warm for (them).\\" In the game's epilogue, the trio admits that they will serve the punishment for their sins in vengeance as \\"undead knights\\". Release On October 1, 2009, the Undead Knights demo was mistakenly replaced with the full game on the PlayStation Store, giving consumers an opportunity to download the full game for free. Reception The reception was very mixed: the reviewers expressed extreme opinions with regards to the most controversial elements of the game. Some of them scorned the inconsistencies with the decorum of the genre and condemned the mixture of the underground death/black metal soundtrack and explicitly vulgar language not necessarily suited to the dark fantasy/medieval entourage. The others in turn praised the game and its story for the potency to evoke cathartic experiences.  Trivia  The narrative layer of the game is abundant in references to the Jewish and Christian creation accounts present in the Bible, early Rabbinic literature and apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. The game utilizes such motifs as the fall of angels, the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the secret of immortality.

Leliefontein Leliefontein is a small community in the Kamiesberg range of Namaqualand, near Garies in the Northern Cape. It is probably named after the many white lilies found in the area. Leliefontein was originally the kraal of a Nama chief named Wildschut by the colonialists. By October 1771, the land had been granted to Hermanus Engelbrecht, a white colonial farmer, but Governor Joachim van Plettenberg ordered Engelbrecht to vacate the land in 1772 after he was informed that the Nama Khoi already occupied the land. Missionary work began under the London Missionary Society in 1809, but an attack by competing settlers caused the station to be abandoned in 1811. In 1816, Chief Wildschut asked for another station to be established. This request was fulfilled by the Wesleyan Methodist Reverend Barnabas Shaw of the Wesleyan Missionary Society. Leliefontein was the first Methodist mission in South Africa. Several church buildings were built thereafter. Attack Boer leader Manie Maritz killed 35 indigenous inhabitants of the settlement, in retaliation for attacking his party when he went to interview the European missionaries in the town. Maritz served under General Jan Smuts. The attack took place over two days. On the first day Maritz and his men rode into Leliefontein, detained the chief missionary, and handed out proclamations threatening death to residents and the missionaries as a punishment for being British sympathisers in the Second Boer War. The Nama people, who were residents of Leliefontein along with the missionaries, were angered by the threats and a scuffle ensued.[Legassick, M. “The Battle of Naroegas: Context, Historiography, Sources and Significance.” Kronos, no. 21, 1994, Jstor] The residents of Leliefontein inflicted serious casualties on the Boers on the first day when they killed 30 Boers and lost only seven Nama people in the fight. Maritz summoned reinforcements and invaded Leliefontein the following day leading to a battle in which 43 Nama people were killed and an estimated 100 wounded. The residents of Leliefontein were massacred while taking shelter in the mission church. Leliefontein was one of the first massacres of the 20th century in South Africa.Smith, J. \\"The bloody smell and ugly sight of Marikana\\" IOL, Business Report, 2012 The Leliefontein mission had livestock and it also produced corn and vegetables. The outpost was completely destroyed by Maritz's troops and indiscriminate violence was meted out to the residents.Ash, C. \\"Kruger, Kommandos & Kak: Debunking the Myths of The Boer War\\", South Publishers, 2014, Google Books The refugees left by the massacre were hunted down by Boer forces and killed. Others were captured and forced to work as slave labourers cooking and cleaning for the troops. Maritz was never punished for his actions at Leliefontein. The Leliefontein Methodist Church and Parsonage is a national heritage site to commemorate the losses of the massacre. Reactions On 31 January 1902, a Boer guerrilla commander Deneys Reitz, part of General Jan Smuts force, arrived in Leliefontein en route to Springbok. Deneys Reitz described the scene as follows: > \\"We found the place sacked and gutted and among the rocks beyond the buried > houses lay 20 or 30 dead Hottentots, still clutching their antiquated > muzzleloaders. This was Maritz’s handiwork. He had ridden into the station > with a few men to interview the European missionaries, when he was set upon > by armed Hottentots, he and his escorts narrowly escaping with their lives. > To avenge the insult, he returned the next morning with a stronger force and > wiped out the settlement, which seemed to many of us a ruthless and > unjustifiable act. General Smuts said nothing but I saw him walk past the > boulders where the dead lay, and on his return he was moody and curt.\\" Maritz took issue with Reitz's interpretation of the situation: > “According to Reitz, General Smuts would have rather approved if he had seen > our own bodies there. I can assure them that we had to fight hard for our > lives that day in front of the church, and if the Hotnots had got the upper > hand, they would have treated us cruelly.” See also *List of massacres in South Africa References Further reading  Category:Second Boer War Category:Second Boer War crimes Category:1902 in South Africa Category:Massacres in South Africa ","title":"Leliefontein massacre"},{"id":"24128853","text":"Černov is a village and municipality (obec) in Pelhřimov District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic.
