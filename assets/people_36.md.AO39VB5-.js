This tool was developed based on the philosophy that design problems occur when changes are made to existing engineering designs that have already been proven successful. Methodology DRBFM Methodology was developed by Tatsuhiko Yoshimura, a Quality Expert and a professor at Japan's Kyushu University. Yoshimura knew that design problems occur when changes are made without the proper level of supporting documentation. Using the philosophy of Preventative Measures (Mizenboushi), he created his own philosophy of DRBFM. Dr. Tatsuhiko Yoshimura supported the development and usage of DRBFM at many companies. He believes companies that implement the usage of DRBFM will be a better company. He believes the implementation of DRBFM requires discipline and engagement of everyone to the one goal of adding value to the customer by meeting engineering functional requirements and customer expectations. The Philosophy of DRBFM centers on three concepts: * Good Design * Good Discussion * Good Dissection The DRBFM methodology is now a recognized documented process by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) and also by AIAG (Automotive Industry Action Group). SAE J2886J2886 : DRBFM Recommended Practice was published in 2013 and the AIAG DRBFM Reference Guide was published in September 2014. Bill Haughey is the chair of both the SAE and AIAG committees to ensure a consistent application of the DRBFM process within both documents. Good Design The basis for reliability is not to change a design; therefore, Mr. Yoshimura believes that if a design changes, the change should occur in small increments. Disturbance to a design is caused by the discontinuity of implementing changes affecting the interfaces between parts and interactions between systems. The design should not be changed in two different places simultaneously, because making too many changes too fast has the potential to result in failures faster than our capacity to detect them. One key to successful change is to make changes visible. Good Discussion In discussions we should concentrate on the proposed changes to a design. If a proven good design is applied to future products, then the risk of failure is low; however, if changes are made to the existing design, then the probability of failure is increased. Mr. Yoshimura advises individuals to work to understand the changes as opposed to trivializing them. He also advises that validation testing can help to identify design weaknesses; but, he also states that good discussions held at preliminary design reviews can achieve the same result. The good discussion that Mr. Yoshimura refers to here is also known as DRBFM (Design Review Based on Failure Modes). The analysis for DRBFM is modeled after a linkage between a good design review and FMEA. A comprehensive, well-done FMEA can be considered one of the inputs (plus many other preparations sheets defined in the methodology) to decide the scope of a DRBFM but an FMEA is NOT required since the focus is based on the changes and interfaces. DRBFM is implemented based on novelty of change at any level of the product (design, process, supplier, etc.). The intent of the DRBFM is to make these changes visible by discussing them at length, as well as every possible concern for failure that may potentially occur - anything that impacts quality, cost, or delivery. Good Dissection The third part of the GD3 concept. One objective of a good design review is to examine the results of validation testing, making all product weaknesses visible. This examination involves applying another GD3 concept, Design Review Based on Test Results (DRBTR). When applying DRBTR, we must, wherever possible, observe the product test before, during and after completion. DRBTR looks for the validation (test) engineer to lead the review of a DRBTR review to exam the tested part and look for buds of problems that are about to happen (test failures are evident). DRBTR encourages the designer and test engineer to discuss potential problems (observations) or weaknesses from a cross functional multi-perspective approach, and to share this information. DRBTR has the designer observing actual test pieces and discussing test results in open discussions, such as design reviews. Furthermore, when dissecting test results, one must consider manufacturing variation, test profile and expected quality and reliability targets of the product. This process is defined in detail in Bill Haughey's Ebook PD251136.

Life Han Xian was a leader among the White Wave Bandits. In 195, Emperor Xian, who had been a puppet emperor under the control of the generals Li Jue and Guo Si since 192, managed to escape from their clutches in Chang'an, the imperial capital, and return to the old capital, Luoyang. Li Jue and Guo Si later regretted their decision to let Emperor Xian leave Chang'an, so they led their troops to pursue the emperor. Yang Feng, a former White Wave bandit, led his troops to fight Li Jue and Guo Si in an attempt to defend the emperor, but lost the battle. He then summoned his old friends, the White Wave Bandits led by Li Le (李樂), Han Xian, Hu Cai (胡才) and others, to come to Emperor Xian's aid. Xiongnu forces led by Qubei (去卑) also responded to the call and came to help Emperor Xian.(李傕、郭汜既悔令天子東，乃來救段煨，因欲劫帝而西， ... 而張濟與楊奉、董承不相平，乃反合傕、汜，共追乘輿，大戰於弘農東澗。承、奉軍敗，百官士卒死者不可勝數，皆棄其婦女輜重，御物符策典籍，略無所遺。 ... 天子遂露次曹陽。承、奉乃譎傕等與連和，而密遣閒使至河東，招故白波帥李樂、韓暹、胡才及南匈奴右賢王去卑，並率其眾數千騎來，與承、奉共擊傕等，大破之，斬首數千級，乘輿乃得進。董承、李樂擁衛左右，胡才、楊奉、韓暹、去卑為後距。傕等復來戰，奉等大敗，死者甚於東澗。) Houhanshu vol. 72. They continued on their journey towards Luoyang after that. Li Jue and Guo Si quickly returned with more troops and defeated Yang Feng and killed several officials who fled with Emperor Xian. The emperor escaped across the Yellow River and reached Anyi (安邑). Around August 196, Emperor Xian returned to Luoyang under the escort of Yang Feng, Dong Cheng and the White Wave bandits. In recognition of their contributions, he appointed Han Xian as General-in-Chief (大將軍) and Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隸校尉). Han Xian and Dong Cheng remained in Luoyang with their troops to protect Emperor Xian. Around the same time, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang, found Emperor Xian, and escorted him to his base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which became the new imperial capital. Han Xian attempted to stop Cao Cao but was defeated by him in battle, so he fled south to join the warlord Yuan Shu. After joining Yuan Shu, Han Xian and Yang Feng (who also came to join Yuan Shu) pillaged and looted several counties in Yang and Xu provinces. In 197, Yuan Shu wanted to declare himself emperor and desired to have a neighbouring warlord, Lü Bu, as an ally, so he proposed a marriage between his son and Lü Bu's daughter. However, Lü Bu rejected the proposal after listening to Chen Gui's advice. In anger, Yuan Shu ordered his general Zhang Xun (張勳), with Yang Feng and Han Xian as his subordinates, to lead troops to attack Lü Bu. Lü Bu heeded Chen Gui's suggestion and managed to induce Yang Feng and Han Xian to turn against Yuan Shu. Yang Feng and Han Xian then joined Lü Bu in attacking Yuan Shu's forces, led by Zhang Xun, and defeated the enemy. After driving back Zhang Xun, Yang Feng and Han Xian led their men to pillage several territories until Zhongli (鍾離) before turning back. When Yang Feng was killed by the warlord Liu Bei in 197, Han Xian left Yuan Shu and headed north back to his native Bing Province.

His publications are striking for their merger of extensive field observations with conceptual insights. Forbes believed that ecological knowledge was fundamental for human well being. Forbes was important to the development of ecological theory. He was acknowledged by the National Academy of Sciences as \\"the founder of the science of ecology in the United States\\". While already famous as an economic entomologist, Forbes undertook studies of massive fish mortality in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. He showed the connection of algae blooms and lake physics to fish kills, and embarked on a remarkable research program into lake ecology and river ecology. Many of his insights about lake ecology were collected in an influential paper, \\"The Lake as a Microcosm\\".Forbes 1887 Notable for both conceptual creativity and the use of innovative quantitative methods, his work foreshadowed the ecosystem concept as well as modern ideas of behavioral ecology and food web dynamics. On top of this, Forbes introduced the concept of a \\"community of interest\\"Forbes, S.A. 1887. \\"The Lake as a Microcosm\\". Bulletin of the Scientific Association of Peoria, Illinois, pp 77–87. Reprinted in Illinois Natural History Survey Bulletin 15(9):537–550. that emphasized two major points: \\"the first that of a general community of interests among all the classes of organic beings here assembled, and the second that of the beneficent power of natural selection which compels such adjustments of the rated of destruction and of multiplication of the various species as shall best promote this common interest.\\" Forbes in 1880 advocated an ecological approach and combinations of resurgence of primary pests, selection of strains of pests resistant to insecticides and general contamination of the environment. Although the term pest management looks new in controlling pests but it is based on decades of development. Forbes is said to be the first to work on the pest management. Forbes showed the importance of local knowledge in the early history of ecology in the United States. Biography Born into a pioneer family, of Scots and Dutch ancestry,Ernest Browning Forbes (1930) \\"Stephen Alfred Forbes, His Ancestry, Education and Character\\", Pamphlets on Biography, Kofoid Collection he spent his youth near Freeport, Illinois, in Stephenson County. Beyond his common school education up to age 14, Forbes' only formal studies at the secondary level were three months during the winter term of 1859–1860 at Beloit Academy in Wisconsin, a year at Rush Medical College in Chicago after the United States Civil War, and the spring term of 1871 at Normal University, Normal, Illinois. Shortly after his fourteenth birthday in 1858, young Stephen witnessed one of the eight famous Lincoln–Douglas debates staged throughout Illinois for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Forbes, apparently emboldened by the contentious atmosphere of the occasion, embarrassed his family and fellow citizens by publicly scolding Douglas from the audience for what he perceived as a Douglas insult to Lincoln. At the age of 17 (in 1861) Forbes would enter the Union Army with his brother and serve with distinction until the end of hostilities in 1865. In 1867, Forbes invested in a strawberry farm in Carbondale, Illinois, which, according to his daughter Ethel, sparked Forbes' interest in the flora of southern Illinois. Following his year of medical school at Rush College, Forbes farmed and taught school in southern Illinois. During this time he began his first studies in natural science in his leisure hours. His first published works appeared in American Entomologist and Botanist in 1870, and a new plant species, which he was the first researcher to describe, was named Saxifraga forbesii in his honor. Forbes' work in natural history came to the attention of John Wesley Powell, then the curator of the museum of the Illinois Natural History Society in Normal. After Powell's departure from the state to pursue studies in the American West, the Illinois Natural History Society was disbanded and metamorphosed into the state-supported State Laboratory of Natural History. Forbes was named director of the new State Laboratory of Natural History in 1877, and in 1882 he became both the director of the State Laboratory of Natural History and the state entomologist. Forbes moved from Normal to Urbana in 1885 to accept a position with the Illinois Industrial University (soon to be University of Illinois). He was also able to gain approval from the state legislature to transfer the State Laboratory of Natural History and its staff, library, and research collections to Urbana. In 1917, the State Laboratory of Natural History and the Office of the State Entomologist were combined by the General Assembly, as the Illinois Natural History Survey. Forbes became director (chief) and held this position until his death in 1930. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. As president of the Ecological Society of America in 1921, he championed the practical uses of basic ecological science for the betterment of humankind. Forbes' extensive knowledge was not limited to entomology, but throughout his life he also studied and achieved distinction in ichthyology, ornithology, river and stream biology and pollution, and the taxonomy of Crustacea. To Forbes the word \\"survey\\" meant more than a censusing of organisms or publishing lists showing their distribution. He felt that any study should define the relationships between living organisms and their environment—an ecological survey. This theory prevailed in his work and underlined the early research done at the Illinois Natural History Survey. In 1880 Forbes stated: > The first indispensable requisite is a thorough knowledge of the natural > order—an intelligently conducted natural history survey. Without the general > knowledge which such a survey would give us, all our measures must be > empirical, temporary, uncertain, and often dangerous. Today, the Illinois Natural History Survey is still housed on the campus of the University of Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana and is a division of the Prairie Research Institute. From 1884 to 1886, while a student at the University of Illinois, entomologist Charles W. Woodworth was an assistant to Forbes. See also * Stephen A.

The Whip was a ride originally designed and built by W.F. Mangels Company of Coney Island, New York, United States.Video: \\"The Whip Amusement Park Ride\\" Than & Now , Technorati. William F. Mangels patented the ride in 1914 and it soon became extremely popular. The ride consists of two circular wheel-like turn-table platforms on opposing sides of a rectangular base. Motors turn a cable that leads a number of 2–3 person seater cars that are attached, around a laminated wooden track. The ride follows the track while the cable turns. When the car reaches one of the turn- table platforms, the speed picks up forcing riders to one side as the car whips around the corner. Whips with 8, 10, or 12 cars were available. At least two 16-car models exist, one operating at Kennywood and the other in storage at Knoebels. The Whip is commonly found at older, historic parks. A children's version was also built that looked exactly like the full size version. A children's roto-whip was also produced and is in a circular motion that whips the cars as it goes around. The children's roto-whips are more common today than the full-scale versions. The Whip's name could lead many to believe it is an aggressive thrill ride but most are actually very tame. The normal minimum rider height requirement is 46 inches tall unless with an adult at most parks, even though most whips are rarely aggressive rides. The version at Knoebel's has non-lockable restraints, and riders can easily get out during the ride's rotation, which may add reason to these restrictions. The Whip spread to other countries such as England. During the 1930s, the English poet John Betjeman described St Giles' Fair in Oxford as follows: Today Two of the oldest Whips operating today are at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania, manufactured in 1918, and Kennywood Park in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, USA., manufactured in 1919. The Whip at Playland (New York) in Rye, NY was made in 1928, and is one of the park's oldest rides. Another installation of a classic Whip is at Knoebels Grove in Elysburg, PA. This whip, called the \\"Whipper\\" was originally installed at a park in Hunlock Creek, PA called Croops Glen moved to Knoebels in the 1940s after that park closed.

The estate is on the Eatons Neck landmass on the edge of Duck Island Harbor, an inlet of Northport Bay, off of Long Island Sound.  History  The home was built by Cornelius Henry DeLamater in 1862 in French Second Empire architectural style, and was originally known as Vermland. DeLamater, who owned over of Eaton's Neck, was the owner of the DeLamater Iron Works located in NYC where W. 13th St meets the Hudson River. The turret, engines, and weaponry on the Ironclad \\"Monitor\\" were built by DeLamater's foundry under the direction of noted marine engineer John Ericsson. DeLamater named his summer estate \\"Vermland\\" after the Swedish province where Ericsson was born as the two men were best of friends and inseparable. After DeLamater's death on February 7, 1889, his Eaton's Neck estate was inherited by his wife Ruth Oakley Caller DeLamater, who died on December 7, 1894 leaving the estate to their daughter Laura DeLamater Bevin. Over time, the house gradually became known as \\"The Bevin House. Laura DeLamater Bevin died on March 4, 1920 and her son Sydney Bevin inherited the property.

It originally aired in 1988, and was later reran on Animal Planet for one year from 1996-1997. Personnel The show was hosted by Neil Crone (referred to on the air as the Guessmaster), and accompanied by Team Tamers Marilyn Smith & Linda Verry, one of whom would also ask a true or false home viewer/audience question going into commercial breaks. Additionally, at some point in each episode, Crone would make up a limerick using the animals representing each team. Gameplay Two teams of two kids, each with an animal name and assisted by an adult team captain (either Marilyn or Linda), competed in a game of answering animal questions. In each round, host Crone read a question with four possible answers. The teams held up a number that corresponds to one of the answers (the selected number and answer were announced by the appropriate team tamer). A correct answer was worth 30 points, but an incorrect answer forced the team to either take a Wild Guess (choose another answer) or pass it up and end the question. When taking a Wild Guess, if the team in control was correct, it was worth 20 points, but an incorrect answer gave the opposing team a chance to steal for 10 points. If they were wrong, no points were awarded. Round Subjects Five rounds were played, with the last round played differently than the first four. Each round had a category, which were as follows: *Living Proof *Triviology *Creature Feature *Call of the Wild - identifying animals by virtue of the sounds *Monkey Business - guessing animal actions *Catnips - teams buzzed-in on a series of questions. Correct answers were still worth 30 points but incorrect answers deducted 10 points. \\\\---- The team with the most points won the game.

This engine, also known as the Steam Horse, ran on four wheels but was pushed by mechanical feet. This was both the first recorded boiler explosion and the first railway accident causing major loss of life, as 16 people were killed [some sources state 13]. The accident is not included in many texts because it was on an industrial waggonway or plateway, rather than a public railway. Nevertheless, it predated William Huskisson's fatal accident at Parkside by 15 years, and the death toll was not exceeded by any railway accident until 1842 worldwide (see Versailles train crash), and 1861 in the UK (Clayton Tunnel). It also killed more people than any other railway boiler explosion of all time. Most boiler explosions caused severe mechanical damage but often only the locomotive crew suffered physically; however, Brunton's locomotive was surrounded at the time by a crowd of curious sightseers, who formed the majority of the victims. The first high-pressure steam locomotive, Trevithick's Penydarren engine, had only appeared 11 years earlier in 1804, and engineering understanding of the forces and safety risks involved was still primitive.

After their son, Jerry, graduated from Weber State University in 1966, they moved the small company to Phoenix, Arizona. Carl and his two sons, Ronald and Jerry (vice-president), formed the company Common Market in Arizona, that would become Swift. Operations began in 1966 transporting imported steel from the ports of Los Angeles, California to Phoenix, Arizona, and returning with cotton from Arizona to be delivered to Southern California. About Swift: Company History . - Swift Transportation The name Swift Transportation was purchased from a descendant of the Swift Meat Packing family, when the Moyes family bought the trucking assets of Swift & Company. The three Moyes family members and a fourth partner, Randy Knight, grew the business to $25 million in annual revenues by 1984. Jerry Moyes became president, chairman, and CEO that same year, and when Carl died in 1985, Jerry bought out the other two partners, his brother Ronald and Randy Knight. Ronald would continue to hold shares in Swift while Randy would become a co-founder of Knight Transportation.Harris, Craig. - \\"Knight's Profits On a Roll - Valley-Based Trucking Firm Again Makes 'Forbes' List\\". - Arizona Republic. - October 30, 2004. - Retrieved: 2008-07-30 In April 1988 Swift purchased Greenville, South Carolina-based Cooper Motor Lines from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based ARA Services.Entrepreneurship Founders: Jerry C.

He was awarded his medal alongside Captain Hugh J. McGrath who performed the same feat. Batson is most noted, however, for creating the Philippine Scouts. Early life Batson was born in Anna Illinois, a small agricultural town located on the Illinois Central Railroad in Union County in southern Illinois but grew up in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. Educated locally, he attended Southern Illinois University for one term. He had two stints of teaching school and spent a year studying law in hopes of passing the bar exam.Edward M. Coffman, \\"Batson of the Philippine Scouts,\\" Parameters vol. 7, no. 3 (1978): 69. Military record Batson enlisted in the 2nd United States Cavalry on 9 April 1888. His motives for doing so remain obscure. Over the next three years he served in troops M and G and attained the rank of corporal. Based on his service record and his marks on a competitive examination, the War Department offered him a commission as second lieutenant in the 9th Cavalry, one of two Regular Army cavalry regiments that consisted of black enlisted men led by white officers. He accepted on 2 August 1891. He spent the next seven years in the 9th Cavalry, primarily in garrison. He married and started to raise a family. During the academic year 1894–95 he attended the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Three years later, during the Spanish–American War, he accompanied the 9th Cavalry to Cuba and participated in the V Corps' campaign against Santiago. He had a credible record in combat at San Juan Hill, but the experience left him disillusioned. He felt that officers who had done less than he had received promotion and recognition while he had received none.U.S., House of Representatives, Official Army Register for 1914, 56th Congress, 2nd sess., H.R. Doc. 624 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1914), p. 478. It was in this frame of mind that on 2 August 1898, Batson was promoted first lieutenant in the 4th Cavalry. Since 1891 promotion in the U.S. Army for all officers was by seniority in branch of service rather than by regiment. His promotion simply indicated that he was the senior cavalry second lieutenant in the Army at that time and that the next available vacancy at the grade of first lieutenant occurred in the 4th Cavalry. It did not constitute official recognition of his service in Cuba.Army Register, 1914, p. 478. Batson accompanied the 4th Cavalry to the Philippines, arriving in October 1898, and joined the VIII Corps, then occupying only the city of Manila and a small area around the Cavite naval base. Initially, the corps commander, Maj. Gen. Elwell S. Otis, assigned the regiment to the 1st Division, VIII Corps, then commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas M. Anderson and subsequently by Maj. General Henry W. Lawton. Eventually, Otis assigned a few troops of the 4th Cavalry to the 2nd Division but kept the bulk of the regiment with the 1st Division. Batson's troop remained with the 1st Division.U.S. War Department, Adjutant General's Office, Correspondence Relating to the War with Spain, Including the Insurrection in the Philippine Islands and the China Relief Expedition, April 15, 1898, to July 30, 1902, 2 vols. (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Army Center of Military History, 1993), 1: 556–583 Fighting broke out between Philippine and American forces on the night of February 4–5 in what was the first clash of a war known as the Philippine Insurrection in the United States but which subsequent historians have often referred to as the Philippine War or the Philippine–American War. The 2nd Division guarded the northern approaches to Manila; the 1st Division the southern. Once the VIII Corps had cleared the Filipinos from the immediate environs of the city, all the strategic objectives—the only railroad in the Philippines and the Philippine capital at Malolos—lay north of the city. While the 2nd Division attacked north along the rail line toward Malolos, the 1st Division's mission became to keep any elements of the Philippine Army away from the city by launching punitive expeditions into the countryside to break up enemy troop concentrations. Batson continued to demonstrate the cool-headed courage under fire that he had first shown in Cuba. On one of these expeditions to Laguna Province, south of Manila, at the town of Calamba, he swam the San Juan River under fire, flanked enemy forces, and compelled them to retire. His commanding officer recommended him for the Medal of Honor. Two and one-half years later he received it. Sometimes major historical events turn on chance and the actions of seemingly ordinary individuals. Matthew Batson, a mere lieutenant, was one of these. Batson had arrived in the Philippines disenchanted with the Army and unlike most of peers with seven years service in a predominately African-American regiment. Yes, he had acted heroically at San Juan Hill, but so had the black troopers that he led. He was well aware of their qualities but especially of their humanity. So he reached the Islands predisposed to judge people of color on their merits as individuals and not lump them together as racial inferiors. In short, he was moving in exactly the opposite direction of the larger American society of which he was a part. In that America, \\"Jim Crow\\" was becoming the law in the South and affecting white attitudes in the North as well. A lieutenant's pay in the Philippines would go much further than in the United States so that sometime after Batson arrived he hired a body servant, a Filipino name Jacinto, whose last name is lost to history. Jacinto was an impressive person. He could already read and write when they first met. Batson studied language with him. Jacinto taught Batson Pampangan; Batson taught Jacinto English. Batson reported to his wife that Jacinto learned English faster than he learned Pampangan. Batson also learned that he came from the town of Macabebe in the province of Pampanga, north and west of Manila. The Macabebes are an ancient ethnic group whose origins are disputed. Since the sixteenth century they have had a fraught relationship with the Tagalogs, the largest ethnic group in the Philippines. Generally, whenever the Tagalogs wanted to do something the Macabebes took a diametrically opposed position. Thus in 1896 when the Tagalogs rose in rebellion against the Spanish, the Macabebes supported the Spanish colonial government. When war broke out between the Americans and the self-proclaimed Philippine Republic led by Emilio Aguinaldo the Macabebes maintained a cool neutrality toward both sides. Batson's impressions about the war were slowly crystallizing in the spring of 1899. He admired the fighting qualities of his opponents. He did not call them \\"Gugus\\" or worse use the N-word as so many of his fellow officers did. He discounted the many rumors circulating in the VIII Corps about Filipino atrocities. He saw them as patriots fighting for their country; he wrote his wife that if he was a Filipino he would be fighting the Americans too. He thought to subdue the Islanders would require an Army of 100,000 men and many years—the cost in lives and money was far more, he thought, than the American people could stand. The only solution, he decided, was to raise native troops to fight against the Philippine revolutionary government. They would cost far less to equip and maintain than unacclimated Americans shipped across the Pacific Ocean. With this thought in mind, accompanied by two captains, a newspaper reporter, and forty enlisted men, he set off for the town of Macabebe sometime before June 1, 1899. The idea of raising a company of Macabebes never got off the ground, but he was very impressed with the inhabitants, who warmly welcomed the Americans. He came away even more impressed by their military potential and certain that a native force was not only feasible but necessary for American victory. Batson's subsequent battlefield heroics called him to the attention of his division commander, General Lawton. Lawton, also a Medal of Honor winner---in the Civil War, had the reputation of being one of the bravest officers in uniform. Lawton liked Batson's idea of raising companies of Filipino volunteers and in September convinced a skeptical General Otis to allow Batson to raise two experimental companies of what were soon called \\"Batson's Macabebe Scouts.\\" Batson quickly organized the first company of 108 men, all of them \\"well disciplined and brave\\" veterans of the Spanish colonial army. Within days he and his company had driven the Insurgents out of two villages. Within a week he had recruited another company, also full of veterans. He thought his men could serve as an example to the Americans, especially the volunteers, in discipline and in observing the rules of war. \\"The men,\\" he told his wife, \\"were not one-fourth as hard to control as our own men.\\" In October, Lawton, equally enthusiastic, authorized him to organize an additional three companies. And so, still a lieutenant, Batson commanded a reinforced battalion of five companies in what Otis intended would be the ultimate campaign of the war—the campaign that would end Aguinaldo's republic and his Army. General MacArthur had pushed the Philippine Revolutionary Army north of Malolos in the spring but he failed to achieve the decisive victory he had hoped to achieve before the onset of the monsoon season ended active operations. With the monsoon soon to end, Otis planned for MacArthur to make a holding attack along the rail line to fix the Philippine Army in place while Lawton's 1st Division drove north on MacArthur's right flank, trapping the Filipinos on the great central plain by systematically blocking all the passes leading into the mountainous interior of Luzon. Meanwhile, Otis had organized an Expeditionary Brigade under Brig. Gen. Loyd Wheaton to make an amphibious landing from Lingayen Gulf in the Philippine Army's rear. Otis' plan almost worked. Batson was in the lead of the Lawton's advance with what was officially styled the \\"Squadron of Philippine Cavalry, U.S. Volunteers\\" using \\"roads in frightful condition.\\" Lawton had nothing but praise for \\"...the Macabebes, who have distinguished themselves from the moment of their employment, and are now our main reliance and support.\\" On 19 November 1899, straining every nerve to block Aguinaldo's retreat into the mountains, Batson and his scouts passed through the town of Tubao and advanced down a long canyon. Entrenched Filipino snipers contested their progress; it took some time for the Macabebes to clear the pass. At dusk they approached a ford on the Aringay River, two miles from the town of Aringay. Some 200 entrenched Filipinos guarded the ford, and \\"a sharp fight\\" ensued that lasted about twenty-five minutes The scouts carried the ford—and two hours later the town—but they suffered substantial losses while doing so. Not the least of these was Batson, shot in the left foot by a Mauser, while he directed his men from horseback. The wound was a bad one, but Batson typically refused to go to the rear in the one medical litter that accompanied his detachment. One of the scouts has been wounded as well. Batson directed that the scout use the litter. Although weak from loss of blood, he rode to the dressing station.Telegram, Lt M. J. Batson to Lt Col Charles G.

A long convalescence followed. For a time the doctors thought they would have to amputate his foot, but in the end they saved it. While in hospital he heard the shocking news that Lawton was dead—killed in action south of Manila. Eventually, Batson was able to return to duty. He was promoted to major of volunteers but he did not receive the colonelcy and command of a regiment of scouts that he aspired to. The death of Lawton and Otis' return to the United States left no one in a command position in the Philippines who fully understood the role that Batson had played in organizing the scouts.. Batson returned to duty with the scouts in March 1900 and was heavily involved in counter-guerrilla operations—with considerable success—for the next year. The incessant activity these operations required undermined his health. An Army doctor who examined him shortly before he returned to the States thought he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He mustered out of the volunteer force when it legally dissolved on 30 June 1901, but by then he had received promotion to captain in the Regular Army. His health did not improve even in the less stressful environment of peace-time garrison life. On 6 February 1902 he retired for \\"Disability in line of duty from wounds received in action.\\" He was only thirty-five. He lived another fifteen years.

History  World Relief is a global Evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that seeks to overcome violence, poverty and injustice. Through love in action, they bring hope, healing and restoration to millions of the world's most vulnerable women, men and children through vital programs in disaster response, health and child development, economic development and peacebuilding, as well as refugee and immigration services in the U.S. For 75 years, World Relief has partnered with churches and communities across more than 20 countries to provide relief from suffering and help people rebuild their lives. Founded in 1944, World Relief is now headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. The organization has offices worldwide including 20 throughout the U.S. It is supported by churches, foundations, and individual donors, as well as through United States Government grants from USAID and other agencies. World Relief reached 7 million beneficiaries with 75,000 volunteers actively engaged in reaching their communities. An estimated 80% of those who directly benefit from World Relief program's are women and children. World Relief works across 7 sectors: health and nutrition, child development, refugee and immigration services, disaster response, economic development, peacebuilding and community resiliency, advocacy and mobilization. World Relief's core programs focus on microfinance, AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health, child development, agricultural training, disaster response, refugee resettlement and immigrant services. World Relief began in 1944 when American Christian denominations worked together with sister churches in war-torn Europe to address critical humanitarian needs. The National Association of Evangelicals established the War Relief Commission to send clothing and food to victims of World War II. After the war, evangelical leaders decided that the War Relief Commission should continue working in post-war Europe and around the world. In 1950, the agency was renamed World Relief and began to focus on other areas of development, providing sewing machines and training so war widows could earn a living, setting up TB clinics, and supporting orphanages and land reclamation projects. World Relief is currently in 20 countries and has 20 US offices and serves over 7 million vulnerable people a year. World Relief is organized as a corporation, and the National Association of Evangelicals as the sole shareholder.  Refugee Resettlement Program  One of the functions of World Relief is their refugee resettlement program. There are currently more refugees in the world than there ever has been since World War II, and World Relief aims to help those affected by crises around the world.\\"UNHCR Global Trends - Forced Displacement in 2017\\". UNHCR Global Trends. Retrieved May 3, 2019. World Relief aims to help refugees as soon as a refugee and their families are forced to flee their home, starting by providing essentials to the families, such as clean water and food. World Relief then tries to help the refugees regain potential lost hope and hopefully grow even further by offering family strengthening programs. World Relief also seeks to help refugees find an affordable home and find a job. Because World Relief is headquartered in the United States, World Relief also tries to help refugees learn English, if they do know it already. Since 1979, World Relief has successfully relocated and supported over 300,000 refugees in the United States.\\"Refugee Crisis\\". World Relief. Retrieved May 6, 2019.

It survives in three Old and Middle Irish recensions, it is part of the Book of Dun Cow. It recounts the birth, life, and death of Conaire Mór son of Eterscél Mór, a legendary High King of Ireland, who is killed at Da Derga's hostel by his enemies when he breaks his geasa. It is considered one of the finest Irish sagas of the early period, comparable to the better-known Táin Bó Cúailnge.Carney, p. 483; West, p. 413, quotes Rudolf Thurneysen as ranking the Togail after the Tain. The theme of gathering doom, as the king is forced through circumstances to break one after another of his taboos, is non- Christian in essence, and no Christian interpretations are laid upon the marvels that it relates. In its repetitions and verbal formulas the poem retains the qualities of oral transmission. The tone of the work has been compared with Greek tragedy.Byrne, pp. 59–64.  Summary  After Conaire Mór has already broken several of his taboos, he travels south along the coast of Ireland. He is advised to stay the night at Da Derga's Hostel, but as he approaches it, he sees three men dressed in red riding red horses arriving before him. He realises that three red men have preceded him into the house of a red man (as Dá Derga means \\"Red God\\"), and another of his geasa has been broken. His three foster-brothers, the three sons of Dond Désa, whom Conaire had exiled to Alba (Britain) for their crimes, had made alliance with the king of the Britons, Ingcél Cáech, and they were marauding across Ireland with a large band of followers. They attack Da Derga's Hostel. Three times they attempt to burn it down, and three times the fire is put out. Conaire, protected by his champion Mac Cécht and the Ulster hero Conall Cernach, kills six hundred before he reaches his weapons, and a further six hundred with his weapons. He asks for a drink as he is cursed with a magical thirst, but all the water has been used to put out the fires. Mac Cécht travels across Ireland with Conaire's cup, but none of the rivers will give him water. He returns with a cup of water just in time to see two men cutting Conaire's head off. He kills both of them. Conaire's severed head drinks the water and recites a poem praising Mac Cécht. The battle rages for three more days. Mac Cécht is killed, but Conall Cernach escapes.Jeffrey Gantz (trans.), Early Irish Myths and Sagas, Penguin Classics, 1981, pp. 37–106  Manuscript tradition  The tale exists in three recensions:  Recension I  Recension I is the earliest version of the saga, which briefly summarises the main events of the narrative. It is alternatively known as Orgain Bruidne Uí Dergae (The Massacre of Ua Derga's Hostel), the title given in Lebor na hUidre, to keep it distinct from the later recensions. * 23 N 10 (RIA): p 72. * Egerton 88: f 13rb (BL) * G 7: col. 5 (NLI) * H 3.18: XVIII, p 556a-556b col. 2 (TCD) * 23 E 25 or Lebor na hUidre (LU): p 99a (f 98b-99a). Later version.  Recension II  Recension II, a composite text, is the most famous version of the tale. On the basis of a number of contradictions, inconsistencies and duplicates in the tale, scholars such as Heinrich Zimmer, Max Nettlau and Rudolf Thurneysen suggested, each in his own way, that the recension represents a conflation of two, possibly three, variant sources. However, Máire West has pointed out the weaknesses inherent to their approach and instead favours the more flexible view that the author drew from a greater variety of written and oral sources.Máire West, \\"The genesis of Togail Bruidne da Derga: a reappraisal of the 'two-source' theory.\\" * H 2.16 or Yellow Book of Lecan (YBL): III, col. 716–739 (facs.: p 91a1-104a17).

Located to the north-east of the centre of Brussels, the station mainly serves trains travelling between central Brussels and Leuven, Antwerp or Brussels National Airport. On these routes it is the first station trains pass through after the North-South connection (North, Central and South stations). Although only local trains stop at Schaerbeek, the station also serves as a terminus for a number of interregional and peak-hour services. As it connects both to the North–South connection and to line 28 through Brussels-West station, it is the point at which trains can be rerouted to reverse direction. The station is relatively large, with 13 platforms, numbered from 3 to 15. Tracks 1 and 2 were used in the past for motorail services carrying passenger cars to destinations mainly in southern France. These were transferred to Denderleeuw station in 2000, and eventually discontinued in 2003. Schaerbeek station lies to the south-west of extensive railway grounds including a goods station and a traction workshop. Ticket offices inside the station building in 2009 prior to its incorporation into Train World The station building in Flemish Neo-Renaissance style was designed by architect Franz Seulen and built in two phases: the left wing around 1890, the main (right) wing in 1913. The building was listed as a monument by the Brussels Capital Region in 1994 and the facades have been restored. Before its closure in 2013 the building was largely disused though ticket counters were open for a limited time every weekday and concessions had been closed since the demise of the motorail services. Today, the station is unstaffed with ticket machines at the entrance. The square in front of the station serves as terminus for tram route 92 as well as bus route 69.

In the fall of 1956, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was created as a result of the merger of the Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee (formerly the Milwaukee State Normal School) and the University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee extension, a UW branch that had been offering graduate degrees in Milwaukee. The newly created university, consisting of the Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee campus and University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee Extension, was considered a part of the University of Wisconsin. Early history Illustration of the State Normal School at Milwaukee, published in the 1885 edition of the Wisconsin Blue Book. In 1880, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a law requiring the Board of Regents of Normal Schools to establish a normal school in the Milwaukee area in order to meet the growing demand for higher education by the city's soaring population. As a result, the Milwaukee State Normal School opened for classes in 1885 at 18th and Wells Streets, with John J. Mapel as president. Over the next 42 years, the Milwaukee State Normal School saw 7 different presidents, the addition of music and liberal arts programs, and rapid growth from an initial enrollment of 46. In 1909, the school moved from downtown to its current location near the lakefront when a new building, now Mitchell Hall, was completed. In 1922, the State Normal School Regents voted to discontinue college courses in an effort to refocus on the instruction of teachers. The Milwaukee State Normal School then began to offer education-related four-year degrees and in 1927, the school changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teacher's College. The Wisconsin State Teacher's College quickly dropped all non-four-year degree programs and offered its first Bachelor of Science degree program in 1937, in education. After World War II, the school added a graduate program in education. In 1946, J. Martin Klotsche became president of the college and remained head of the evolving institution until 1973. In 1951, when the Legislature empowered all state colleges to offer liberal arts programs, the Wisconsin State Teacher's College changed its name to Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee, which became part of the University of Wisconsin five years later. Since 1956 The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was founded in the belief that \\"if metropolitan Milwaukee was to be great, it would need a great urban public university\\". Pressed by the growing strong demand for a large comprehensive public university that offered graduate programs in Wisconsin's largest city, the Wisconsin state legislature passed a bill in 1955 to create the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The current University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was established in 1956, as a result of the merger of the Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee and University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee extension, a UW branch that had been offering graduate degrees in Milwaukee.The new university consisted of the WSCM campus near the lakefront and the University of Wisconsin extension in downtown Milwaukee. The first commencement of the new University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was held on June 16, 1957. On June 13, 1958, Milwaukee's Socialist mayor Frank P. Zeidler was the first person to receive an honorary doctorate from the university. Enrollment grew from 6,195 in 1956 to 9,354 in 1962 and new academic programs, colleges and schools were created to meet student demands. Mitchell Hall In 1964, the campus of the neighboring private women's institution, Milwaukee-Downer College, was purchased by the state to expand the UWM campus; Milwaukee-Downer College had previously merged with Lawrence College to form the present Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. The university had already purchased the former campuses and buildings of the former Milwaukee-Downer Seminary and Milwaukee University School along Hartford Avenue . In 1971, the University of Wisconsin System was created by the legislature, and UWM became a legally distinct entity from the University of Wisconsin, of which it had until that point been a part. In the 50 years since the Milwaukee campus was added to the UW System, UWM has expanded to 12 schools and colleges that offer 84 undergraduate programs, 48 graduate programs and 20 doctoral degrees, with a university-wide focus on academic research, teaching and community service. In 1988, the UW System designated eight Centers of Excellence at UWM. The university is designated a \\"Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary)\\" institution in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. In 2005, UW–Milwaukee surpassed UW–Madison in the number of Wisconsin resident undergraduate students and resident graduate students. In 2008 and 2009, the school saw the establishments of the School of Public Health and the School of Freshwater Sciences. In 2010, UW-Milwaukee purchased its neighboring Columbia St. Mary's Hospital complex. In the early 2011, UW- Milwaukee closed the land purchase for its Innovation Park in Wauwatosa.

The society is currently responsible for over 1000 clubs and 40,000 registered members across the UK, all of whom may receive the magazine Archery UK four times a year, included in their affiliation. It also organises its own national tournaments and is responsible for training coaches, as well as ensuring affiliated clubs are covered by their public liability insurance policy. These costs are partly covered by affiliation fees, which all club members pay, both to county and regional associations and Archery GB itself.  History  The first Grand National Archery Meeting was held on the Knavesmire at York in 1843 but the Grand National Archery Society (later Archery GB) itself was not founded until 1861,Encyclopedia of Sport, Charles Harvey (ed.) – Purnell & Sons 1959 when it met at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. It confined its early activities to organising the Annual National Championships, being at that time just one of many archery Societies; and it did not become the governing body for the UK until much later. Following this, it became mandatory – rather than optional – for every archer who wished to enter a competition or shoot at a club to become a GNAS member for insurance purposes, and administration was through clubs, counties and regions. Three older and historically important societies – all of which survive today – were the Royal Toxophilites (founded in 1781), the Woodmen of Arden (founded in 1785), and the Royal Company of Archers (founded in 1676). They are independent of the GNAS, although some members may belong to both.

The battle concluded with victory for Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Background In 194, while Cao Cao was away attacking Tao Qian in Xu Province, his subordinates Chen Gong and Zhang Miao rebelled against him and aided Lü Bu in invading his base in Yan Province. Cao Cao abandoned his invasion of Xu Province and turned back to attack Lü Bu, culminating in the Battle of Yan Province which lasted more than 100 days. By 195, Cao Cao had retaken all his cities in Yan Province and defeated Lü Bu at Juye. Lü Bu and his men fled east to join Liu Bei, who had succeeded Tao Qian as Governor () of Xu Province. In 196, Cao Cao found Emperor Xian in the ruins of Luoyang and brought him to Xuchang, where the new capital and imperial court would be based. In the same year, Lü Bu took advantage of the conflict between Liu Bei and Yuan Shu to capture Xiapi (present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), capital of Xu Province, effectively seizing control of the province from Liu Bei. Liu Bei was forced to surrender his governorship of Xu Province to Lü Bu and settle in the nearby city of Xiaopei. Not long later, Lü Bu felt threatened by Liu Bei's presence and led his troops to attack Liu. Liu Bei was defeated by Lü Bu and had no choice but to join Cao Cao. Cao Cao provided Liu Bei with supplies and sent him to garrison at Xiaopei. Around 197, Yuan Shao was in control of the three provinces of Ji, Qing and Bing north of the Yellow River, so he wrote a letter to Cao Cao in an arrogant tone. Around the same time, Cao Cao had just been defeated by Zhang Xiu at the Battle of Wancheng and the letter angered him. Cao Cao felt threatened by Yuan Shao's growing influence in northern China and wanted to attack Yuan, but felt that his forces were not strong enough. Cao Cao's strategists Guo Jia and Xun Yu assessed the situation, listing out the various advantages Cao Cao had over Yuan Shao. They also advised him to use the opportunity to eliminate Lü Bu when Yuan Shao was at war with Gongsun Zan, because it was possible that Yuan Shao might ally with Lü Bu to attack him. Cao Cao then made preparations for a campaign against Lü Bu. Battle Conflict between Lü Bu and Yuan Shu In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor and sent his subordinate Han Yin () to meet Lü Bu, proposing a marriage between his son and Lü Bu's daughter, so as to foster a stronger alliance between him and Lü Bu. Lü Bu initially agreed to the proposal and sent his daughter to follow Han Yin back. However, Lü Bu still bore a grudge against Yuan Shu for attacking him five years before, so he changed his mind after listening to Chen Gui. Lü Bu pursued the convoy and retrieved his daughter, captured Han Yin, and sent him to Xuchang, where Han was executed on Cao Cao's order. Cao Cao appointed Lü Bu as General of the Left () and personally wrote him a letter to console him. Lü Bu sent Chen Deng to meet Cao Cao and thank Cao on his behalf. When Chen Deng met Cao Cao, he said that Lü Bu was bold but not very astute, and was untrustworthy, so he should to be eliminated as soon as possible. Cao Cao agreed with Chen Deng's view. Chen Deng was appointed Administrator of Guangling and secretly implanted by Cao Cao as a spy in Lü Bu's forces. On the other hand, Yuan Shu was angered by Lü Bu's betrayal, so he sent his generals Zhang Xun () and Qiao Rui () to lead an army to attack Xiapi from seven directions in collaboration with the White Wave Bandits led by Han Xian and Yang Feng. Lü Bu was in a disadvantageous situation, with only 3,000 men and 400 warhorses. He was afraid that he might not be able to resist Yuan Shu so he blamed Chen Gui for giving him poor counsel. Chen Gui, however, thought that Han Xian and Yang Feng were not genuinely loyal to Yuan Shu, so he advised Lü Bu to persuade them to break their alliance with Yuan Shu. When Lü Bu attacked Yuan Shu's forces, Han Xian and Yang Feng defected to his side. Yuan Shu's troops were defeated and Lü Bu pursued them until he reached south of the Huai River. Siege of Xiapi In 198, Lü Bu made peace with Yuan Shu again, and sent his general Gao Shun to attack Liu Bei at Xiaopei. Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun with an army to reinforce Liu Bei, but they were still defeated by Gao Shun. Xiaopei fell to Lü Bu's forces in October 198 and Liu Bei escaped, but his wives were captured. Following that, Cao Cao officially launched his military campaign against Lü Bu. When Cao Cao's army reached Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), Chen Gong urged Lü Bu to attack Cao Cao because Cao Cao's troops were weary from their long march from Xuchang. Lü Bu, however, insisted on staying in Xiapi and wait for Cao Cao to arrive before attacking. A month later, Cao Cao conquered Pengcheng. At the same time, Chen Deng defected to Cao Cao's side and led his men from Guangling to Xiapi. Lü Bu personally led his troops out to engage the enemy but was defeated and forced to retreat. Lü Bu returned to Xiapi and defended the city firmly without advancing. Cao Cao wrote a letter to Lü Bu, explaining the perilous situation the latter was in. Lü Bu became afraid and had the intention of surrendering, but Chen Gong felt that Cao Cao's army had travelled a long distance and would not be able to fight a prolonged battle. Chen Gong advised Lü Bu to garrison part of his forces outside the city, while the rest would remain with him inside, so that they can support each other if either side came under attack. Chen also said the best time to engage Cao Cao's forces would be months later, when Cao's supplies run out. Lü Bu agreed with the plan and wanted to leave Chen Gong and Gao Shun behind to defend Xiapi while he was stationed outside the city. However, Lü Bu's wife claimed that Chen Gong and Gao Shun could not get along with each other, so that would be a problem if Lü Bu was not around. She also felt that Cao Cao treated Chen Gong better (before the latter's defection to Lü Bu) than how Lü Bu was treating Chen now, so Chen might betray Lü Bu. Lü Bu thus aborted Chen Gong's plan. Lü Bu sent Wang Kai () and Xu Si () to request reinforcements from Yuan Shu, but Yuan refused when he recalled how Lü Bu reneged on the marriage proposal earlier. Wang Kai and Xu Si attempted to persuade Yuan Shu to send aid, claiming that Yuan Shu would be isolated if Lü Bu was eliminated. Yuan Shu considered sending relief forces, but did not do so immediately. In the meantime, Lü Bu thought that Yuan Shu was unwilling to help him because of the marriage proposal incident, so he personally escorted his daughter out of Xiapi and attempted to send her to Yuan Shu's territory. However, Lü Bu encountered Cao Cao's troops outside the city and was unable to break out of the siege, so he had to turn back. Cao Cao's troops began to become tired and weary after failing to capture Xiapi despite besieging it for a long time. Cao Cao had the intention of withdrawing, but his strategists Xun You and Guo Jia thought that Lü Bu's army was already low on morale after having suffered so many defeats, so they advised Cao Cao to press on with the siege. Cao Cao then ordered his soldiers to direct the waters of the Yi and Si Rivers to flood Xiapi. The beleaguered Lü Bu prepared to surrender after Xiapi was flooded for over a month, but Chen Gong stopped him. Lü Bu's surrender Lü Bu's general Hou Cheng found a man to help him take charge of 15 horses, but the man escaped with the horses, planning to present them to Liu Bei. Hou Cheng personally pursued the man and retrieved the horses. The other generals congratulated Hou Cheng on his achievement and Hou prepared food and wine and presented to Lü Bu. Lü Bu was furious and said, \\"I ordered a ban on alcohol, and now you prepare wine. Are you planning to make me drunk and then turn against me?\\" Hou Cheng was unhappy and afraid, so on 7 February 199 he plotted with Song Xian () and Wei Xu () to capture Chen Gong and Gao Shun before surrendering to Cao Cao.(九州春秋曰：初，布騎將侯成遣客牧馬十五匹，客悉驅馬去，向沛城，欲歸劉備。成自將騎逐之，悉得馬還。諸將合禮賀成，成釀五六斛酒，獵得十餘頭豬，未飲食，先持半豬五斗酒自入詣布前，跪言：「間蒙將軍恩，逐得所失馬，諸將來相賀，自釀少酒，獵得豬，未敢飲食，先奉上微意。」布大怒曰：「布禁酒，卿釀酒，諸將共飲食作兄弟，共謀殺布邪？」成大懼而去，棄所釀酒，還諸將禮。由是自疑，會太祖圍下邳，成遂領衆降。) Jiuzhou Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7.(太祖塹圍之三月，上下離心，其將侯成、宋憲、魏續縛陳宮，將其衆降。) Sanguozhi vol. 7.(曹操壍圍之，壅沂、泗以灌其城，三月，上下離心。其將侯成使客牧其名馬，而客策之以叛。成追客得馬，諸將合禮以賀成。成分酒肉，先入詣布而言曰：「蒙將軍威靈，得所亡馬，諸將齊賀，未敢甞也，故先以奉貢。」布怒曰：「布禁酒而卿等醞釀，為欲因酒共謀布邪？」成忿懼，乃與諸將共執陳宮、高順，率其衆降。) Houhanshu vol. 75. When Lü Bu heard about Hou Cheng's defection, he led his remaining men to White Gate Tower, where he saw that Cao Cao's troops were closing in on him. He asked his men to kill him and bring his head to Cao Cao, but they refused. Lü Bu then surrendered.(布與麾下登白門樓。兵圍之急，令左右取其首詣操。左右不忍，乃下降。 ... 布及宮、順皆縊殺之，傳首許市。) Houhanshu vol. 75. Aftermath Lü Bu and his followers were tied up and brought before Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Cao Cao ordered Gao Shun to be executed after Gao did not reply when Cao asked him if he had anything to say. Lü Bu complained that he was too tightly bound but Cao Cao said, \\"A tiger should be tightly tied up.\\" Lü Bu then attempted to persuade Cao Cao to spare him and promised to serve Cao. As Cao Cao was pondering, Liu Bei said, \\"Haven't you seen what happened to Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo?\\" Cao Cao rubbed his jaw. Lü Bu scolded Liu Bei, \\"You're the most untrustworthy person.\\"(布與其麾下登白門樓。兵圍急，乃下降。遂生縛布，布曰：「縛太急，小緩之。」太祖曰：「縛虎不得不急也。」布請曰：「明公所患不過於布，今已服矣，天下不足憂。明公將步，令布將騎，則天下不足定也。」太祖有疑色。劉備進曰：「明公不見布之事丁建陽及董太師乎！」太祖頷之。布因指備曰：「是兒最叵信者。」) Sanguozhi vol. 7. The Yingxiong Ji (英雄記; Records of Heroes) stated that Cao Cao initially wanted to spare Lü Bu's life after Lü pledged to serve him. However, Wang Bi (), Cao Cao's registrar, immediately stopped Cao Cao and said, \\"Lü Bu is a formidable prisoner-of-war. His subordinates are nearby, he cannot be spared.\\" Cao Cao then said to Lü Bu, \\"I wanted to spare you, but my registrar refuses. So, what should I do?\\"(英雄記曰：布謂太祖曰：「布待諸將厚也，諸將臨急皆叛布耳。」太祖曰：「卿背妻，愛諸將婦，何以為厚？」布默然。 獻帝春秋曰：布問太祖：「明公何瘦？」太祖曰：「君何以識孤？」布曰：「昔在洛，會溫氏園。」太祖曰：「然。孤忘之矣。所以瘦，恨不早相得故也。」布曰：「齊桓舍射鉤，使管仲相；今使布竭股肱之力，為公前驅，可乎？」布縛急，謂劉備曰：「玄德，卿為坐客，我為執虜，不能一言以相寬乎？」太祖笑曰：「何不相語，而訴明使君乎？」意欲活之，命使寬縛。主簿王必趨進曰：「布，勍虜也。其衆近在外，不可寬也。」太祖曰：「本欲相緩，主簿復不聽，如之何？」) Yingxiong Ji annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. When Cao Cao asked Chen Gong what would happen to his family members, Chen hinted that Cao should spare them. Cao Cao spared Chen Gong's family and treated them well.(太祖之禽宮也，問宮欲活老母及女不？宮對曰：「宮聞孝治天下者不絕人之親，仁施四海者不乏人之祀，老母在公，不在宮也。」太祖召養其母終其身，嫁其女。) Sanguozhi vol. 7.(魚氏典略曰： ... 宮死後，太祖待其家皆厚於初。) Dianlüe annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Chen Gong then accepted his fate and walked to the execution ground without looking back. Cao Cao was deeply grieved by Chen Gong's death.(操謂陳宮曰：「公臺平生自謂智有餘，今意何如？」宮指布曰：「是子不用宮言，以至於此。若見從，未可量也。」操又曰：「柰卿老母何？」宮曰：「老母在公，不在宮也。夫以孝理天下者，不害人之親。」操復曰：「柰卿妻子何？」宮曰：「宮聞霸王之主，不絕人之祀。」左傳曰：「齊桓公存三亡國。」固請就刑，遂出不顧，操為之泣涕。) Houhanshu vol. 75. Cao Cao then had Lü Bu executed by hanging. He ordered the dead bodies of Lü Bu and his followers to be decapitated and their heads sent to Xuchang and then later buried.(於是縊殺布。布與宮、順等皆梟首送許，然後葬之。) Sanguozhi vol. 7. Cao Cao accepted Zhang Liao, Chen Qun and others who previously served Lü Bu, and appointed them as generals or officials under him. Other minor warlords such as Zang Ba, Sun Guan (孫觀), Wu Dun (), Yin Li, and Chang Xi (昌豨) who used to side with Lü Bu also surrendered to Cao Cao, and he put them in charge of various commanderies along the coastline. With the end of the Battle of Xiapi, Cao Cao completely eliminated the threat posed by Lü Bu. The following year, Liu Bei broke ties with Cao Cao and seized control of Xu Province after killing Che Zhou (車冑), but Cao Cao quickly defeated Liu and regained control of the province. With Xu Province now firmly in his control, Cao Cao no longer had any impending threats on his home base in Yan and Yu provinces. This became an advantage to Cao Cao in the subsequent Battle of Guandu in 200 against Yuan Shao. Order of battle Cao Cao and Liu Bei forces * Cao Cao ** Xun You ** Guo Jia ** Xiahou Dun *** Han Hao * Liu Bei ** Guan Yu ** Zhang Fei Lü Bu forces * Lü Bu, executed ** Chen Gong, executed ** Gao Shun, executed ** Hou Cheng ** Song Xian () ** Wei Xu () ** Cheng Lian () In Romance of the Three Kingdoms The battle was romanticised in chapters 18–19 of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Some fictional events were added, while actual ones were modified to large extents for dramatic effect. In the novel, the battle took place in two stages: the first took place near Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) while the second was at Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu) itself. Some notable events in the novel's account of the battle are as follows: Xiahou Dun losing his left eye Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to lead reinforcements to help Liu Bei, who was under attack by Lü Bu at Xiaopei. When Xiahou Dun arrived, he encountered Lü Bu's army led by Gao Shun, and he engaged Gao in a one-on-one fight. Both of them duelled for about 40-50 rounds. Gao Shun could not hold on any longer so he retreated, with Xiahou Dun in pursuit. Lü Bu's subordinate Cao Xing spotted Xiahou Dun on the battlefield, and he fired an arrow which hit Xiahou in his left eye. Xiahou Dun cried out and pulled out the arrow together with his eyeball. He exclaimed, \\"(This is) the essence of my father and the blood of my mother, (I) cannot waste it!\\" He then swallowed his eyeball and charged towards Cao Xing. Cao Xing was caught off guard and was killed by Xiahou Dun, who speared him in the face. The soldiers from both sides were shocked by the scene before them.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 18. ;Historicity Xiahou Dun's biography in the Sanguozhi mentioned briefly when Xiahou Dun participated in a battle against Lü Bu's forces, he was hit by a stray arrow and was injured in his left eye.(太祖自徐州還，惇從征呂布，為流矢所中，傷左目。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. No further details were provided. The Weilüe stated that after the incident, the soldiers nicknamed Xiahou Dun \\"Blind Xiahou\\". Xiahou Dun hated that nickname and when he saw his reflection in a mirror, he would knock it onto the ground.(魏略曰：時夏侯淵與惇俱為將軍，軍中號惇為盲夏侯。惇惡之，每照鏡，恚怒，輒撲鏡於地。) Weilüe annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. The only record of Cao Xing in history exists in the Yingxiong Ji (英雄記; Records of Heroes), which stated that when Hao Meng rebelled against Lü Bu in 196, Hao's subordinate Cao Xing refused to join him in the rebellion. Hao Meng and Cao Xing fought, and Cao was injured by Hao but he managed to slice off Hao's arm. Hao Meng was later killed by Gao Shun. Lü Bu later praised Cao Xing for remaining loyal to him.(英雄記曰： ... 建安元年六月夜半時，布將河內郝萌反， ... 萌將曹性反萌，與對戰，萌刺傷性，性斫萌一臂。順斫萌首，牀輿性，送詣布。布問性，言「萌受袁術謀，謀者悉誰？」性言「陳宮同謀。」時宮在坐上，靣赤，傍人悉覺之。布以宮大將，不問也。性言「萌常以此問，性言呂將軍大將有神，不可擊也，不意萌狂惑不止。」布謂性曰：「卿健兒也！」善養視之。創愈，使安撫萌故營，領其衆。) Yingxiong Ji annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Hou Cheng's defection This incident took place when Lü Bu was besieged by Cao Cao's forces in Xiapi for months. His subordinate Hou Cheng seized back 15 horses stolen from them and Lü Bu's men wanted to celebrate. Hou Cheng feared that Lü Bu might be angry because the latter had already banned his men from consuming alcohol, so Hou presented five bottles of wine to his lord. However, Lü Bu was furious and he wanted to have Hou Cheng executed, but Song Xian (), Wei Xu () and others pleaded with Lü Bu to spare Hou Cheng. Lü Bu agreed and had Hou Cheng flogged 50 times before releasing him. Lü Bu's men were all upset by the incident. Hou Cheng later plotted with Song Xian and Wei Xu to betray Lü Bu. That night, Hou Cheng stole Lü Bu's steed, the Red Hare, and fled to Cao Cao's camp. He told Cao Cao about their plan.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 19. ;Historicity The Sanguozhi stated that Lü Bu's followers were starting to become disunited after Lü Bu had been besieged in Xiapi by Cao Cao's forces for about three months. His generals Hou Cheng, Song Xian and Wei Xu captured Chen Gong and brought their men to surrender to Cao Cao. The Jiuzhou Chunqiu gave a similar account of the story in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, except that Lü Bu did not have Hou Cheng flogged when the latter presented wine to him. Instead, Hou Cheng became afraid after Lü Bu scolded him and threatened to execute him, so he discarded the wine and returned to join the other generals. He later became suspicious of Lü Bu and eventually led his men to surrender to Cao Cao. Lü Bu's biography in the Houhanshu combined the original text in the Sanguozhi and the Jiuzhou Chunqiu account, stating that Hou Cheng and others captured Chen Gong and Gao Shun and surrendered to Cao Cao. Lü Bu's final moments Lü Bu was resting when his subordinates Song Xian and Wei Xu captured him and tied him up. They threw his ji down the walls and opened the gates for Cao Cao's forces to enter. Lü Bu was brought before Cao Cao and he complained that he was too tightly bound, but Cao Cao said, \\"A tiger must be tied up securely.\\" Lü Bu then said to Hou Cheng, Wei Xu and Song Xian, \\"I treated all of you well, why do you betray me?\\" Song Xian replied, \\"(You) listen to your wives and concubines and ignore our advice. You call this 'treating us well'?\\" Lü Bu remained silent. Cao Cao then had Gao Shun executed. He wanted to spare Chen Gong but the latter insisted on accepting his fate and was executed as well. Lü Bu attempted to persuade Cao Cao to spare him, saying that he was willing to serve under Cao Cao and help him conquer the empire. When Cao Cao asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu replied, \\"Haven't you seen what happened to Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo?\\" Lü Bu glared at Liu Bei and said, \\"You're the most untrustworthy person!\\" As he was being dragged away, Lü Bu turned back and shouted at Liu Bei, \\"Big eared fellow! Have you forgotten the incident when I fired an arrow through the ji?\\"Lü Bu was referring to an incident in which he prevented a conflict between Liu Bei and Yuan Shu (represented by Ji Ling) through a gamble. In the gamble, he would fire an arrow through an opening in the blade of his ji from a distance of about 100 paces away. If his arrow passed through the opening, Liu Bei and Ji Ling would have to withdraw their forces and make peace. If he failed, then Liu Bei and Ji Ling could prepare for war. Lü Bu succeeded and prevented the conflict. He saw himself as having saved Liu Bei's life because Yuan Shu's forces were more powerful than Liu's at that time, and he was implying that now that he was about to be executed, Liu should also save him. Cao Cao then had Lü Bu executed by hanging and his dead body decapitated. ;Historicity The Sanguozhi stated that Lü Bu surrendered when he saw that he had been surrounded, instead of him being captured by his own subordinates who had betrayed him. His final words, said to Cao Cao and Liu Bei moments before his death, were similar to those mentioned in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Cao Cao then had Lü Bu hanged. He ordered Lü Bu's dead body to be decapitated and the head sent to the capital Xuchang and later had it buried. Lü Bu's biography in the Houhanshu mentioned that Lü Bu asked his subordinates to take his head and surrender to Cao Cao when he saw that he had been surrounded by Cao's forces. However, his subordinates were unwilling to do so, hence they surrendered together. The rest of the account is similar to that in the Sanguozhi and its annotations. Zhang Liao's surrender When Zhang Liao was captured and brought before Cao Cao after the battle, he scorned Lü Bu for his cowardly behaviour. He showed no fear and even remarked that Cao Cao was lucky to have survived the blaze at Puyang (referring to an earlier battle in which Cao was almost killed). Cao Cao was furious and he drew his sword and wanted to kill Zhang Liao, but Guan Yu and Liu Bei stopped him and pleaded with him to spare Zhang. Guan Yu even knelt down. Cao Cao laughed, sheathed his sword, and said, \\"I also know Wenyuan (Zhang Liao's courtesy name) is a loyal and righteous man. I was just testing him.\\" He then personally released Zhang Liao from his bonds, took off his coat and wrapped it around Zhang, and offered him a seat. Zhang Liao was moved by Cao Cao's sincerity so he submitted to Cao.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 19–20. ;Historicity The Sanguozhi did not mention anything about this incident. It just simply stated that Zhang Liao surrendered to Cao Cao and was commissioned as a \\"General of the Household\\" () and received the title of a \\"Secondary Marquis\\" ().(太祖破呂布於下邳，遼將其衆降，拜中郎將，賜爵關內侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

Saunders put it on the air in 1950; the station closed on July 14, 1988, though its license hung around for another decade and was used in a frequency swap to move KVNA. History KCLS was the third radio station to be built in Flagstaff. The first, KFXY, operated in Flagstaff from December 10, 1925 to 1932. The station was owned and operated by Mary Costigan and operated from the Orpheum Theatre and Monte Vista Hotel. It changed its call letters to KUMA on June 22, 1932, as part of a move to Yuma; the station operated in Yuma until the FCC revoked its license on February 1, 1940, because the licensee did not actually operate the station. The second attempt, KWRZ on 1340 kHz, was owned by the Grand Canyon Broadcasting Company and broadcast between April 4, 1947 and September 30, 1949, when it was shuttered for financial reasons and the unlawful transfer of the station without the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. While KCLS had been initially slated to debut as a daytime-only station on 1220 kHz, the demise of KWRZ prompted KCLS to apply for the 1340 frequency instead, and the station changed to 1340 before going on the air in August 1950. The station was owned by Saunders Broadcasting and named for Charles's daughter, Cheryl Lynn Saunders. In 1953, KCLS moved to 1360 kHz, quickly followed by a shift to 600 kHz in 1954. On this frequency, the station broadcast with 5,000 watts of power in the daytime and 500 watts directional at night; this made it the most powerful AM radio station in Northern Arizona. The KCLS studios were originally a quonset hut. Throughout most of its history, KCLS broadcast \\"middle-of-the-road\\" or \\"adult contemporary\\" music. It was also an early communications link for members of the nearby Navajo tribe, broadcasting in Navajo for one hour a day from 5 to 6 in the morning until the mid-1970s. The station had a long tradition of local news, with several radio announcers moving on to news positions in larger markets and with networks. The station contracted with the National Weather Service to have their meteorologists deliver the weather. KCLS was also well known for broadcasting Northern Arizona University sports and also high school sports. Charles Saunders also owned stations KUPI and KQPI in Idaho Falls, Idaho at different times in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Saunders, who was known as \\"C-J the D-J\\", served as mayor of Flagstaff from 1958 to 1960. KCLS was sold to Charles T. Goyette and James A. KurtzFCCData: KCLS in 1986. Shortly after, Goyette exited the partnership. Kurtz opted to have the land rezoned for a mobile home park, citing increased competition for listeners from new FM stations. On July 14, 1988, Kurtz informed general manager Anthony DeFazio that he would shut down KCLS that day. DeFazio would be the final voice heard over the station, delivering one last newscast at 6pm informing of KCLS's closure. KCLS's folding left a major void in the market, particularly for local sports. KVNA moved to acquire on-air talent, including DeFazio, and sports rights including Los Angeles Dodgers baseball and Flagstaff High School football. NAU sports migrated to KMGN 93.9 FM. While KCLS had gone dark, the license remained active and was ultimately sold to TVNA Limited Partnership, the owners of KVNA. They swapped the frequencies of KVNA and KCLS, with KCLS moving (on paper) to 690 and KVNA relocating from 690 to 600. The KCLS license was canceled in February 1997 for failure to transmit in a 12-month period under Section 312(g) of the Communications Act.

In topological graph theory, an embedding (also spelled imbedding) of a graph G on a surface \\\\Sigma is a representation of G on \\\\Sigma in which points of \\\\Sigma are associated with vertices and simple arcs (homeomorphic images of [0,1]) are associated with edges in such a way that: * the endpoints of the arc associated with an edge e are the points associated with the end vertices of e, * no arcs include points associated with other vertices, * two arcs never intersect at a point which is interior to either of the arcs. Here a surface is a compact, connected 2-manifold. Informally, an embedding of a graph into a surface is a drawing of the graph on the surface in such a way that its edges may intersect only at their endpoints. It is well known that any finite graph can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^3.. A planar graph is one that can be embedded in 2-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^2. Often, an embedding is regarded as an equivalence class (under homeomorphisms of \\\\Sigma) of representations of the kind just described. Some authors define a weaker version of the definition of \\"graph embedding\\" by omitting the non- intersection condition for edges. In such contexts the stricter definition is described as \\"non-crossing graph embedding\\".. This article deals only with the strict definition of graph embedding. The weaker definition is discussed in the articles \\"graph drawing\\" and \\"crossing number\\". Terminology If a graph G is embedded on a closed surface \\\\Sigma, the complement of the union of the points and arcs associated with the vertices and edges of G is a family of regions (or faces).. A 2-cell embedding, cellular embedding or map is an embedding in which every face is homeomorphic to an open disk.. A closed 2-cell embedding is an embedding in which the closure of every face is homeomorphic to a closed disk. The genus of a graph is the minimal integer n such that the graph can be embedded in a surface of genus n. In particular, a planar graph has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self- crossing. The non-orientable genus of a graph is the minimal integer n such that the graph can be embedded in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus n. The Euler genus of a graph is the minimal integer n such that the graph can be embedded in an orientable surface of (orientable) genus n/2 or in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus n. A graph is orientably simple if its Euler genus is smaller than its non-orientable genus. The maximum genus of a graph is the maximal integer n such that the graph can be 2-cell embedded in an orientable surface of genus n. Combinatorial embedding An embedded graph uniquely defines cyclic orders of edges incident to the same vertex. The set of all these cyclic orders is called a rotation system. Embeddings with the same rotation system are considered to be equivalent and the corresponding equivalence class of embeddings is called combinatorial embedding (as opposed to the term topological embedding, which refers to the previous definition in terms of points and curves). Sometimes, the rotation system itself is called a \\"combinatorial embedding\\".... An embedded graph also defines natural cyclic orders of edges which constitutes the boundaries of the faces of the embedding. However handling these face- based orders is less straightforward, since in some cases some edges may be traversed twice along a face boundary. For example this is always the case for embeddings of trees, which have a single face. To overcome this combinatorial nuisance, one may consider that every edge is \\"split\\" lengthwise in two \\"half- edges\\", or \\"sides\\". Under this convention in all face boundary traversals each half-edge is traversed only once and the two half-edges of the same edge are always traversed in opposite directions. Other equivalent representations for cellular embeddings include the ribbon graph, a topological space formed by gluing together topological disks for the vertices and edges of an embedded graph, and the graph-encoded map, an edge-colored cubic graph with four vertices for each edge of the embedded graph. Computational complexity The problem of finding the graph genus is NP-hard (the problem of determining whether an n-vertex graph has genus g is NP-complete). At the same time, the graph genus problem is fixed-parameter tractable, i.e., polynomial time algorithms are known to check whether a graph can be embedded into a surface of a given fixed genus as well as to find the embedding. The first breakthrough in this respect happened in 1979, when algorithms of time complexity O(nO(g)) were independently submitted to the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing: one by I. Filotti and G.L. Miller and another one by John Reif. Their approaches were quite different, but upon the suggestion of the program committee they presented a joint paper.. However, Wendy Myrvold and William Kocay proved in 2011 that the algorithm given by Filotti, Miller and Reif was incorrect. In 1999 it was reported that the fixed-genus case can be solved in time linear in the graph size and doubly exponential in the genus. Embeddings of graphs into higher-dimensional spaces It is known that any finite graph can be embedded into a three-dimensional space. One method for doing this is to place the points on any line in space and to draw the edges as curves each of which lies in a distinct halfplane, with all halfplanes having that line as their common boundary. An embedding like this in which the edges are drawn on halfplanes is called a book embedding of the graph. This metaphor comes from imagining that each of the planes where an edge is drawn is like a page of a book. It was observed that in fact several edges may be drawn in the same \\"page\\"; the book thickness of the graph is the minimum number of halfplanes needed for such a drawing. Alternatively, any finite graph can be drawn with straight-line edges in three dimensions without crossings by placing its vertices in general position so that no four are coplanar. For instance, this may be achieved by placing the ith vertex at the point (i,i2,i3) of the moment curve. An embedding of a graph into three- dimensional space in which no two of the cycles are topologically linked is called a linkless embedding. A graph has a linkless embedding if and only if it does not have one of the seven graphs of the Petersen family as a minor.

However, the female is in fact silently listening to the call the entire time, having previously been contacted by the host. During the skit, the host asks the suspect questions that will hopefully reveal the identity of the subject of their affair, and other questions that may help understand the nature of it. For example, the host will typically ask the suspect for one or two sentences to be used as an optional \\"personal message\\" to be included with the gift, before asking for the name of the desired recipient. Once the man gives up the name and reveals the secret relationship, the woman is free to jump in and chastise the guilty party over the phone. The ruse may be improvised depending on what is believed to most likely attract the suspect's attention. Examples used include free concert tickets for a man who \\"couldn't stop talking about how Beyoncé is coming to town next week but who still hasn't asked [his wife] to go\\" with him, or a purported call from a venereal disease clinic. The VD ruse involved stating that \\"someone with a disease listed you as a recent sexual partner, but we can only tell you more (for confidentiality reasons) if you can tell us the name of the person who might have referred you\\". Often, the target is confused and bewildered when confronted on the phone, because they are unaware that they've been taken in by a ruse, and often believe their significant other is really at home listening on an extension. Suspects who believe this continue with the prize dialogue with the radio station host and continue to embarrass themselves, unaware that the entire call is a prank. Other suspects turn out to not be cheating at all, and end up sending the roses - and the embarrassment along with them - to their significant other who initiated the call. History War of the Roses was created in early 1994 by Los Angeles radio personality Rick Dees shortly after receiving word that crosstown KGGI Riverside/San Bernardino morning show host Sean \\"Hollywood\\" Hamilton was having tremendous rating success with a similar feature called \\"Bait Your Mate\\". In 2012, Hamilton, with War of the Roses, dominated in New York City ratings. One of the earliest known segments was done in 1996 on Andy Savage's radio program \\"The Edge\\" based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. While Savage has claimed the bit was real, it is still up for debate as mentioned by Snopes.com At an internal company ceremony recognizing Dave Ryan's 25th Anniversary at KDWB, program director Rich Davis told the crowd that Ryan has to \\"think of new ideas for War of the Roses every week.\\" While Ryan immediately responded \\"But it's real,\\" Davis's impromptu quip lends evidence to the conclusion that this program element may not be completely authentic.

Description A. × zoeschense is a medium-sized tree growing up to 20 m (66 feet) tall, and almost as wide. The shiny, five-lobed leaves are 10–11 cm long and up to 14 cm broad, dark green, often with purplish edges. The petioles produce a milky latex when broken. The flowers are produced in open corymbs 5–10 cm diameter, each flower small, pale yellow-green, with five sepals but no petals. The fruit is a paired samara 5 cm across; the two seeds are usually sterile. Cultivation One cultivar, A. zoeschense 'Annae', was popular as a street tree in previous generations.

After a brief loan spell at Zvyazda Minsk, he played his last season for Slavia in 2002, moving another Belarus club, Gomel. His only season there brought another championship medal, in 2003. That success brought the attention of the top Romanian club, Dinamo București, who signed him to a three-year deal in 2003. His first game for Dinamo came in the second half of the 2003/2004 season, in a game against Farul Constanţa on 24 April 2004; a game Dinamo won 2–1. That season he played only 2 games, but enough to earn a Championship medal.

At a young age, he moved from Morocco—perhaps from Fes—to Jerusalem, where he became a pupil of Levi ibn Ḥabib.http://www.forumrarebooks.com/Ibn-Susan-Issachar-Yssachar- Ben-Hebrew-sefer-ibbur.html From there he went to Safed, where, under great hardship, he continued his studies. But his increasing poverty induced him, in 1539, to leave Safed and seek a living elsewhere. At this time he commenced a work on the calendar, giving, among other things, tables which embraced the years 5299–6000 (1539–2240). After his return to Safed he resumed his work on the calendar, in which he was assisted by the dayyan Joshua. It was published at Salonica, in 1564, under the title Tikkun Yissakar. The second edition, under the title Ibbur Shanim (Venice, 1578), is not as rare as the first. The tables in both editions begin with the year of publication. The book also contains, in two appendixes, a treatise on rites (\\"minhagim\\") depending upon the variations in the calendar from year to year, and a treatise on the division of the weekly portions and the hafṭarot according to the ritual of the different congregations. For the latter treatise the author quotes as his source ancient manuscript commentaries, and holds that, according to the opinion of a certain scholar, the division of the weekly portions is to be traced back to Ezra. Rites, anonymously given, are, according to p. 51, 2d edition, taken from Abudarham, to whom the author attributes great authority.

It included the towns of Lime Kiln, Buckeystown, Adamstown, Doubs, Licksville, Tuscarora and Point of Rocks. Charles Carroll of Annapolis granted the entire estate to his son, Charles Carroll of Carrollton. It is from this tract of land that he took his title, \\"Charles Carroll of Carrollton.\\" While Charles Carroll of Carrollton never lived on Carrollton Manor, he erected a manor house there, Tuscarora, where he spent a few days or weeks at a time. The eldest daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton married Richard Caton and was the mother of the \\"three American graces\\" who married British noble men: the eldest, Marianne, marrying the Marquess Wellesley, K.G., a brother of the 1st Duke of Wellington; the second, Louisa Catherine, first to Sir Felton Hervey-Bathurst, 1st Baronet and later the 7th Duke of Leeds; and the third, Elizabeth, the 8th Lord Stafford. These titled ladies continued for years to retain possession of portions of the manor and to collect large rental revenue from the estate's many fertile farms. The manor house was the home of his favorite granddaughter, Marianne Caton, and her husband, Robert Patterson. The house is a two-story house of Federal architecture, built of native limestone circa 1820, situated in Adamstown, Maryland. Originally the house had 14 rooms; more were added later until there were 21. The walls are twenty-four inches thick, the floors are oak and many doors still have the original latches. Partitions through most of the house are solid brick. Beyond the wide front door is a rectangular reception hall with access to the rooms. There are twin drawing rooms and a stairway that sweeps from the basement to the attic. Each room has its own fireplace. The manor house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The manor hummed with industry in the early 19th century with mills operated by water power built on the Monocacy River to grind grain. Wheat supplanted tobacco in Carroll's agricultural policy. Kilns were established to burn lime to fertilize the fields. The Pattersons lived at Tuscarora only a few years. When cholera broke out in the neighborhood, they fled to Baltimore, Maryland, but Mr. Patterson died a few days later. After Mr. Patterson's death, Tuscarora was occupied by tenants. The Manor was reduced in size by being divided into small farms until only about two thousand acres (8 km²) remained. After the death of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the estate was deeded to his descendants. Since the heirs of Charles Carroll were scattered over the world, they employed agents or overseers to look after their interests. Soon most of Carrollton Manor had been sold or leased. Among the large purchasers was Louis McMurray, who was the first to start the corn canning industry in Frederick County. He also canned peas and other vegetables. Two large canning plants were located on Carrollton Manor, one at Buckeystown, Maryland, controlled by the Baker Brothers, the other at Adamstown controlled by the Thomas Brothers. Careless tenants neglected and abused Tuscarora. Turkeys were raised in a bedroom, hogs in the basement and cured hams dripped from the attic. The descendants held Carrollton Manor as absentee landlords until around 1923 when it was bought by the Baker family. About 1949 two of the original farms of the Manor were sold to Mr. & Mrs. Pascal Renn. They made extensive improvements to Tuscarora and furnished it with antiques and reproductions of the colonial period. It was thrown open for a Garden Pilgrimage in 1953. Surprisingly the banisters and stairway survived and the woodwork was in good condition and the cupboards, inner window shutters and doors stayed in place. In the 1950s, the Renns sold the farm to Eastalco, which erected a large aluminum plant on the farm. Tuscarora is still standing and is used by Eastalco's successor owner, Alcoa as guest house and meeting center. There is also a Carrollton Manor community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Geography Skootamatta Lake is about long and wide, and lies at an elevation of . There is one named bay in the northwest of the lake called Jacques' Bay, and two named islands, Bible Island and Blake Island. The primary inflow, at the northeast bay, is the Skootamatta River from the direction of Pearson Lake. Secondary inflows are: Killer Creek at the west; an unnamed creek at the west; an unnamed creek at northwest; five unnamed creeks at the northeast bay; three unnamed creeks at the east; and three unnamed creeks at the south, one from Sheldrake Lake. The primary outflow is the Skootamatta River, at the southeast tip of the lake, controlled by the Skootamatta Dam. The dam regulates the level of water in the lake and provides low-flow augmentation and flood control downstream. The Skootamatta River flows via the Moira River to the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. Recreation The lake is a popular destination for cottagers and fishermen alike. The lake is easily accessible by car with two main roads leading from Highway 41: Hughes Landing Road, which has a public use boat ramp, and Jacques Bay Road. The lake is also one of the few in the area with an abundance of crown land, so boat traffic on the lake is usually fairly low.

All three have rich history of several hundred years and display a fusion of Mughal and Rajasthani art and architecture. They are now part of the Heritage group of hotels under the flagship name of \\"Samode\\" that are run by the hereditary owners of these structures. The Samode Palace is located north of Jaipur city, the Samode Haveli is close to Jaipur (centrally located within city limits, away from the city railway station) and the Samode Bagh or Garden, from the palace which is also run as a luxury hotel. Many Hindi feature films have been pictured with the settings of the palace. The 1984 American HBO TV serial adaptation of the Raj-romance novel The Far Pavilions was also filmed in the palace precincts and starred Ben Cross, Amy Irving, Omar Sharif and Christopher Lee.The Far Pavilions on imdb.com History Samode is a large town in Rajasthan, which belonged to the landlords known as ‘zamindars’ (in Hindi language) of the principal thakurs of the state of Amber. It shot into prominence due to the Thakurs lineage traced to Maharaja Rajveer Singhji, the 17th prince of the house of Kacchwaha Rajputs. Samode was bequeathed to Gopal Singhji one of his 12 sons, as a noble feudatory of the Amber and Jaipur principality. Samode was, even then, considered a very rich town under the kingdom of Amber. Behari Das, a Rajput warrior who was then in Mughal service of the Nathawat clan inherited the Zamindari of Somede. It was under the British Raj but was restored to the Nathawat clan with the hereditary title 'Rawal Saheb' or 'Maha Rawal' (title conferred for their valiance and loyalty to the royal family), in 1757, and this lineage is continued to this date. Samode Palace was initially built in the sixteenth century as a Rajput fort, but in the early 19th century, under the nobleman Rawal Berisal, it was converted from a fort into an exquisitely designed palace in Rajput and Muslim architectural style. Rawal Berisal, during this time also served as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan and exercised full powers. He was signatory, on behalf of the Maharaja of Jaipur, to the treaty signed in 1818 with the British East India Company, which gave it the status of a protectorate to Jaipur. Rawal Sheo Singh, a descendant of Rawal Berisal, who was the Prime Minister of Jaipur state for several years, during the middle of the 19th century, further expanded the Palace by adding the Durbar Hall (considered as \\"extravagantly florid and hand painted\\") with a gallery and the Sheesh Mahal or the hall of mirrors. In 1987, it was converted into the heritage \\"Samode Palace Hotel\\". Samode haveli was also built by Rawal Sheo Singh more than 150 years ago. It was built as a resort for the royal family. Samode Bagh or Samode garden was landscaped more than 150 years ago by one of the sons of Maharaja Prithiraj Singhji of Jaipur. It was patterned on the lines of Mughal gardens, which the Mughals had developed in other parts of their kingdom as a retreat for relaxation and enjoyment. The royal family of Samode also established a similar garden 4 kilometres away from their Samode Palace. Geography and climate Geographically, the three monuments and the village of Samode and its structures are in the pristine hill range of the Aravalli Range in north- western India. The climate at Samode is severe with summer heat reaching as high as and winter temperatures dropping to . Structures The three heritage structures are: Samode palace The palace, built by the noblemen of the court of the royal family, is located near the Samode village on the outskirts of Shekhawat. It is built of sandstone at the foot of the Aravalli range of hills (the foremost mountain range of north-western India) with a fortress-like setting. The interiors of the palace are composed in the ancient architectural style of Rajasthan: marble floors, intricately ornamented pillars, mosaic walls (with tiny pieces of small inlaid stones), with luxurious carpets, and decorated with old wall paintings (hunting scenes, floral motifs and so forth). At the entrance gate of the palace is a unique piece of a large-sized treasure chest made of dark wood with marble settings and gleaming glass. The Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors) is located on the southern side of the palace. The frescoes in the Durbar Hall and in the Sultan Mahal are said to be 250 years old. The palace is built on three levels (planned in a sequence of courtyards of increasing height) with a patio on each floor. There is an old ruined fort above the palace from where a panoramic view of the valley could be seen. The fort area is overgrown with vegetation but stone paved paths have been built to reach the fort heights. Samode fort was the former residence of the Maharaja. It is said that an underground passage links it to the palace that provided access at times of emergency. It is now approached by a well laid out stone paved path (300 steps). There is also an entry gate to the ruined fort. Two other forts close by complete the circuit of a circular walk from and back to the palace. There is also a small temple, 3 kilometres away from the fort. The Samode village near the palace is noted for its cloth made by block printing and also for handicrafts such as bangle making. There is a small artists' colony in the village where miniature paintings are made. Samode haveli The haveli is built facing north. It has an elegant painted dining room and an air passage. It has a unique ambiance of the historic juxtaposed against a contemporary setting. An elephant ramp, specially constructed at the entrance to the haveli, was laid in 1940 on the occasion of the marriage ceremony of a member of the Royal family. Samode bagh Samode Bagh, or garden, a 16th-century Mughal style garden, enclosed by a high wall is spread over an area of . It also has 44 sandbank coloured tents with air-conditioning to accommodate visitors. It blends traditional Rajasthan and Mughal décor with the Victorian style, with modern facilities. It has a long water channel with a row of fountains that are fed by springs and wells. The tent walls also depict elegant paintings in Mughal art. The tents have been furnished with carpets, standing lamps and well designed beds and chairs and other modern facilities. There is also a 150-year-old pavilion within the precincts of the garden. Visitor information The palace, the haveli and the garden are at a distance of , and respectively from Jaipur. Jaipur, in turn, is well connected by rail, road, and air to all the major cities in the country. Jaipur is from Delhi by road on the National Highway NH-8. Entry to the palace costs Rs 1000 per person as of 15 August 2015. This includes a tour of the palace and can be credited towards food and drink in the courtyard restaurant. The tour includes the ladies waiting rooms, the (room of mirrors), the Durbar hall, and the pool area (viewing only, no swimming).

As well as being one of the fifteen teams that played in the inaugural FA Cup in 1871, they also represented Great Britain at the first ever Olympic football tournament in 1900, which they won. History Founded in 1866, the club were one of the 15 teams to play in the very first edition of the FA Cup in 1871–72; they never won the competition but did reach the quarter-finals on four occasions. They were also the inaugural winners of the London Senior Cup in 1882–83. Though resolutely an amateur club, they inadvertently sparked the legalisation of professionalism in the game after complaining about Preston North End's payments to players after the two met in the FA Cup in 1884; Preston were disqualified, but the incident made the FA confront the issue and, under threat of a breakaway, they allowed payments to players the following year. The club were wound up in 1887 but were resurrected four years later in 1891. In 1892 they were founder members of the Southern Alliance, an early league competition amongst teams from southern England, but were bottom of the league with only one win to their name when the competition folded before the 1892–93 season ended. Despite the obvious similarity of name to Upton Park stadium (officially known as the Boleyn Ground), the club had no connection with the ground and never played there; however there were formal links between Upton Park and West Ham United (then known as Thames Ironworks) and many players did play for both. In addition, Upton Park's home games in West Ham Park attracted large crowds to their games, which may have influenced Thames Ironworks' decision to move to the area from Canning Town, where football was not as popular. 1900 Olympic Games An Upton Park team of 1900. That year the team won the Gold medal representing Great Britain at the Olympics The Amateur Status Committee of the Football Association offered the club the opportunity to play in Paris at the inaugural Olympic Games. Records show that Upton Park were the first club to agree to play but were unlikely to be the first to be asked. Upton Park were not participating in a league at the time playing only cup games and friendlies. They had never reached the semi-final stage of the FA Amateur Cup and the competition was now in its seventh year. The club secretary and goalkeeper James Jones selected the team and brought in players from other amateur teams; Richard Turner joined from Crouch End Vampires, William Gosling, a soldier on leave, joined from Chelmsford, Alfred Chalk joined from Ilford and Jack Zealley joined from Bridport FC. Gosling's Chelmsford side had beaten Upton Park 7–1 in January 1900. Upton Park won the competition in Paris, beating a USFSA XI representing France, 4–0. Although a gold medal was not awarded to the side at the time (it being a demonstration sport), the IOC have since retrospectively awarded one.The Official Olympics website lists Great Britain as being 1900 gold medal-winners in the football tournament. The team that day (playing a 2–3–5 formation) was: :James Jones; Claude Buckenham, William Gosling; Alfred Chalk, T. E. Burridge, William Quash; Richard Turner, F. G. Spackman, John Nicholas, Jack Zealley, Henry Haslam (captain) Note that the spellings of names differs slightly from names listed by RSSSF. The scorers were Nicholas (with two), Turner and Zealley. Famous players Famous players for the side included Charles Alcock, later president of the Football Association, FA Cup Final referees Alfred Stair and Segar Bastard (who was also an England international), and Charlie Dove, one of the early leading players for Thames Ironworks. Upton Park also supplied two other England internationals, Clement Mitchell and Conrad Warner. Claude Buckenham, who played in the Olympic team of 1900, represented England at cricket. Legacy Upton Park continued to play until at least 1911, according to modern-day records. The Upton Park Trophy, the annual playoff between the league champions of Guernsey and Jersey, is named for the Upton Park side, to commemorate their tenth annual tour of the islands, which they made in 1906. In 2016, coinciding with West Ham United's move to the London Stadium, Upton Park were 'reformed' as an amateur club and staged the final game at the Boleyn Ground, against Royal Engineers. Upton Park FC was responsible for proposing two of the most important rule changes in the history of association football: in 1870, the club proposed abolishing all handling of the ball (previously, any player was allowed to catch the ball). In 1871, the club introduced a proposal to create the special position of goalkeeper, who alone would be allowed to handle the ball.

Anti-environmentalists seek to persuade the public that environmental policy impacts society negatively. The movement’s goals include to counter the effects of environmental ideology and movements, to redirect and diminish public concern about the environment, to discredit left-leaning environmentalists, and to persuade politicians against increased environmental regulation. Concern for economic growth is the source of anti-environmentalist beliefs. Anti-environmentalists weigh the benefits to the business sector of the economy more heavily than the consequences lack of regulation has to the environment and inhabitants. Anti-environmentalists believe that humans do not need to interfere with the Earth’s natural processes and, therefore, environmental regulation is unnecessary. Anti- environmentalists argue that the Earth is not as fragile as environmentalists maintain. They believe Earth will continue to maintain and restore itself through natural cycles as it did long before humans arrived, and will continue to maintain itself long after humans are gone.  History Anti- environmentalism is a counterrevolution to the environmentally conscious movements of the late 20th and early 21st Century. In response to the rapid mobilization of society to a greener standard of operations, anti- environmentalism served as a tool to loosen the grip of government regulation. Businesses and governments developed anti-environmentalism to counteract the growing worldwide concern for the environment. The late 1960s and early 1970s exemplified public awareness of conservation for the land and sea. With this newfound public concern, large businesses lost the general public’s trust and were viewed as environmentally detrimental institutions. This ultimately resulted in the creation of legislations and contracts based upon these environmental issues.  Canada  Concern about the impacts of human activity on the environment in Canada started in the 1960s with the concern of pollution. Throughout the 1960s, more emphasis was put on nature conservation, as the natural environment started to be seen not only as scenic, but important to human survival. Public concern for the environment turned into action with the development of activist groups such as Greenpeace. This concern was later reflected in decisions made by the Canadian government, as was seen with Canada ratifying the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 under the leadership of Jean Chrétien of the Liberal Party. Critics of the environmental movements described Greenpeace as a radical group, displaying an act of \\"domestic extremism\\".  China  During the Maoist period in China (1949-1976), Maoism was a popular political theory which guided communism in China and believed in using and destroying nature for economic and industrial growth. Maoism emphasized the importance of industrial growth and saw the destruction of the environment -such as extraction of resources- as essential for the benefit of Chinese people and the economy Eventually with China's growing industrial economy, China began to be a large producer of Carbon emissions globally, thus China began to take environmental action in 1990 and eventually enacted the Implementation of a Renewable Energy Law in 2005. The Chinese government -who once believed in the extraction of natural resources as a method of industrialization- has since transitioned to implement policy to reduce the effects of carbon emissions. China also believes they must exclude businesses from environmentalism because most are opposed to any environmental action.  Mexico  From the 1980s, Mexico experienced rampant deforestation to create room for pastures. Tropical forests covered 50% of the state of Tabasco in 1940, which then was reduced to 10% in the late 1980s. The result of this has been mass soil erosion nationwide. By 1985, 17% of Mexico's land was classified as totally eroded, while almost 50% of land was classified as experiencing an accelerated erosion, or signs of impending erosion. The coastline of Mexico experiences other problems, such as the exploitation of petrol as there are relaxed regulations concerning petrol. In 1992, this resulted in 1,000 barrels of gasoline leaking into municipal sewer systems in Guadalajara, where the gases and chemicals produced an explosion killing almost 200 people. Following this event, in 1994, President Bill Clinton issued executive orders demanding that the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation and the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States Concerning the Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission be enforced so that it aligns with American environmental policy. One study conducted in the mid-1980s of twelve urban areas around the world concluded that residents of Mexico City had the highest levels of cadmium in their blood. The concentration of pollutants was impacting surrounding ecosystems, as well as residents in the area. These impacts included birth defects and high levels of gastrointestinal disease. Also in the 1980s, the Mexican government implemented various anti-pollution policies in Mexico City. These policies included vehicle emission inspections, introducing unleaded gasoline, and the installation of converters on vehicles to help reduce pollution created by buses and trucks. Another study in Mexico determined that five million tons of contaminants were released into the atmosphere each year; ten times more than in the previous decade. Vehicles and industrial plants were found to be the main contributors of contaminants into the atmosphere. As well, fecal matter becomes airborne in Mexico during the winter months, resulting in residents being diagnosed with a variety of respiratory illnesses. United States During his time as President of the United States, Bill Clinton made strides towards environmentalism and sustainability. Throughout the 1990s, Clinton signed various executive orders committing to the preservation of many facets of the environment including animals, forests and wetlands. In 1993, Clinton and Gore hosted the Forest Conference which was considered to be the beginning of developing a comprehensive, long term policy in which workers, businesses and communities dependent on timber sales would be supported. In the same year, Clinton issued executive orders for federal agencies to increase the use of alternative-fueled vehicles and reduce the use of materials which deplete the ozone. As well, Clinton spearheaded an environmental justice movement, ensuring that low-income citizens and minorities did not disproportionately feel the impacts of industrial pollution, and minimizing the hazards associated with the construction of pipelines. Clinton's successor, President George W. Bush stated in his campaign platform that he would \\"ensure that the federal government, which is the country's largest polluter, complies with all environmental laws\\" and that the United States would even exceed the set standards. Though once elected, Bush verged from what he had promised during his campaign, and instead reversed Clinton administration initiatives on drinking water, and advocated for oil exploration in protected regions. Bush's administration also moved forward in withdrawing its support of the Kyoto Protocol, a worldwide global warming agreement created in 1997. Bush stated that he would work with allies to the United States to reduce greenhouse gases, but would not carry out a plan that would harm the economy and hurt American workers.  Political perspectives  Environmental policy is criticized by some politicians for its impact on businesses. Some conservative and neo-liberal groups want to develop and maintain industry and capitalism through diminution of environmental policy. Anti-environmental politicians seek to reduce governmental regulation because businesses are often criticized by environmentalists for having negative impacts on the environment, so they see environmental policy as governmental control of businesses. Some common arguments are that economic growth justifies environmental harm and that employment could be diminished by environmental policy.  Canada  * Conservative Party: In recent years, conservative political parties in North America have been supportive of an anti-environment agenda. In Canada, a main proprietor of this agenda has been Stephen Harper, the former Prime Minister of Canada. When the conservative party released their 2012-2013 budget it was evident that they had intentions of speeding up development over environmental concerns. Bill C-38 changed environmental assessment for major industrial projects, and got rid of Canada's Environmental protection laws. The party also changed the fisheries act to limit its protection of fish. The conservative party worked against environmental groups, perceiving them as ideologically driven. The natural resource minister at the time, Joe Oliver, stated that environmentalists are \\"radicals who undermine the Canadian economy.\\" The Harper government made many budget cuts to environmental programs and initiatives, including cutting $547,000 worth of funding from the Canadian Environmental Network, $53.8 million from environment Canada and $29.2 million from parks Canada. $12.5 million was cut from enforcement of the Species at Risk Act. ** Stephen Harper: Stephen Harper criticized Canada's prior environmental policy for having high restrictions on industry, as Harper sought to industrialize. He wanted to ensure that industries could have better access to natural resources with the goal of increasing Canada's Economy. In May 2011, Harper and the Conservative Party of Canada won the Canadian federal election with a majority government, which allowed them to make significant changes to Canada's environmental policy. A bill passed May 2012 titled the \\"Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act.\\" The Harper government focused more economic growth, such as the oil industry in Alberta. Northern Alberta has oil in their tar sands and extracting it was seen by environmentalists as destruction to the environment and a source of Greenhouse gas emissions. The Harper government focused on expanding the economy over the interests of environmentalists. Also environmental groups were also deemed \\"extremists\\" by the Harper Government and listed them under the anti-terrorism strategy as a national security threat.  United States  * Republican Party: Over the past decades, Republicans have increasingly become doubtful of climate change, stating that the changes occurring are natural. Much like Conservative parties in Canada, there has been an augmentation towards an anti-environmentalist perspectives. * Democratic Party: Contrary to the Republican Party, Democrats believe in climate change and its effects.  Major conflicts   Alberta oil sands in Canada  The Alberta oil sands has also been a point of contention between environmentalists and anti-environmentalists. Anti-environmentalists maintain that the oil sands have improved Canada's relations with the United States as Canada is their number one foreign supplier of oil. As well, the oil sands have brought a secure source of energy to Canada, as well as tremendous economic gains for Alberta. There are some environmental efforts in place to mitigate the effects that the mining involved in operating the oil sands mine has on animal species, though environmentalist groups are not satisfied. Environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace are concerned with the environmental, social and health impacts of mining the oil sands, particularly on First Nations communities in Alberta.  Standing Rock in the United States  The source of this conflict is that on January 25, 2016, Dakota Access announced that it received permit approval to move forward with the construction of a four-state crude oil pipeline which would transport 470,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. Anti-environmentalists defended the construction of the Pipeline as it would create thousands of jobs, make the United States more energy independent and create a more cost- effective method of transporting oil to major refining markets. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe took issue with this as the pipeline would run through their communities, tainting their sacred land as well as contaminating their water supply. What followed in the next ten months was a response from Sioux communities, protestors and environmentalist groups in the form of peaceful protests in which over 400 arrests were made by local law enforcement. 26 Environmentalist groups responded to the event with an open letter condemning the actions of the North American banks who helped fund the pipeline, and encouraged them to stop any future payments contributing to it. Anti-Mining Mobilization in Peru In the early 1990s, there was an increase in large-scale mining and hydrocarbon operations in Peru. This development created disputes within rural communities. The main cause of conflict involved the struggle over land and natural resources. Individuals tended to participate in illegal operations that oftentimes caused environmental consequences. In May 2009, Defensoria del Pueblo from the Ombudsman's Office made a publishment which highlighted 268 social conflicts in Peru. In June of the same year, a protest against the García administration's concession on the rights of petroleum exploration on indigenous land created a conflict costing the lives of 24 police officers and 10 civilians. In April 2010, Madre de Dios, the Amazonian department witnessed a protest which resulted in 6 informal gold miners being shot and killed. Within the same month, a conflict concerning roughly 6,000 informal protectors and 1,000 police officers occurred in the southern department of Aregupa. Approximately 1,000 protestors were killed. A later report published by the Ombudsman's Office in June 2010 recorded 250 conflicts. Out of these, 18 were developing in the department of the northern highland of Cajamarea and another 13 concerned mineral extraction. Resistance to Coal Power Plant in Kenya In June 2018, Kenyan protestors marched the streets in demand that their President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop the building process of a coal power plant in their country. Officials state that the power plant will satisfy Kenya's rising demand for electric power. One of the protest's organizers Khalid Hussein of the national human rights group made a statement that coal is poison to both the people and the environment and citizens are demanding for the plant to not be installed. The coal power plant is being constructed by a Chinese company, China Power Global. Critics believe that this project will pollute the environment and damage the marine ecosystem. This can extend to conflicts due to climate change-induced migration. In 2007, the Christian Aid Charity warned that towards the end of the 21st century 184 million Africans could die from the result of climate change alone, and that roughly one billion will be forced to leave their homes as effects of climate change worsen. The Czech Republic and the Highway by- pass project In 1991, Plzen Czech Republic experienced immense air pollution that citizens felt was the source of their health problems. So the government decided they needed to build a new highway so the traffic could no longer create pollution in the city. Two different plans were created, one being the K variant which put the highway south of the city, and the S variant which would go through protected land, and would have negative impacts on rural areas as opposed to the city. This event began environmental movements in the Czech Republic that protested the S variant. In previous years, Czechoslovakia had been focused on the soviet model of industrial expansion which lacked environmental regulation. This had effects on the environment, such as low- grade coal used in houses and by industries as well as lead gasoline used in automobiles. In the 1980s environmental activists protested the governments lack of environmental regulation. Political campaigns thereafter became increasingly anti-environmental through media outlets and newspaper coverage. Media coverage shared statements such as \\"Environmentalists believe that bugs are more important than people\\" and \\"Beware of environmentalists – they are extremists.\\" These statements created fear of environmental causes in the population.  Global relations  Since the early 1990s, key issues across the world regarding how nations should address the concept of climate change have created several tensions. As a result, from these tensions, global relations (specifically between developed and developing nations) have diminished in quality. For example, the Kyoto and Copenhagen Conferences in the late 2000s brought up issues revolving nuclear power energy use in Japan and the nuclear radiation detected on the coast of other countries of the Pacific. Eventually the argument was settled between Japan and its oppositional forces of the United Nations, led by key large nations of the West such as the United States, in the Copenhagen Accord. The Copenhagen Accord itself hosts large controversy, headed by promises of both developed and developing nations to mitigate advocations for action against climate change. In other words, in an attempt to create a regime that complements the United Nation's core beliefs that often correlate to Western society's beliefs, attitudes of past imperialism were implemented on a global scale. An earlier occurrence reflects the same concept, when Indonesia experienced widespread drought between the years 1993 and 1997. During this time period, rice, Indonesia's staple crop and food source, experienced major detriment in its production, causing riots resulting from a dramatic increase in price of rice and political instability. China played a key part during this period, being that the country made settlements on subsidies for rice, as China experienced an abundance of rice yield during the same period. This furthered Indonesia's debt to China, cancelling out any progress made by the two nations during the Settlement of Indonesia's Debt Obligation to China conference of 1990. China, being a country seeking development is the world's second largest economy has grown 10% annually for a decade, which allowed for people to no longer living in poverty, is due to China's overall sentiment in the past of focusing on development now and later caring about the environment. Pro-Environmental policies criticize China's economic development as causing \\"air, water and soil pollution\\". Chinese industry utilizes the cheapest methods of production and labour to advance their economy which in turn impacts the environment and environmental policy can impose restriction's on the advancement of china's economy and industry. The Paris Agreement was an international legal agreement implemented December 2015, for states to take collective action against climate change by working towards decreasing the globe's average temperature and make countries financing consistent with that goal. The United States - under the Obama Administration - agreed upon the Paris Agreement. When Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, he pulled out of the agreement due to his major concern for its restrictions on building industry in the United States despite the pressures from allies and lobbying groups.  Anti-environmentalism in the 21st century   Canada  In 2014, Environment Canada released its annual emissions trends report, which showed that Canada was not going to meet emission reduction targets as was promised in 2009. In fact, Canada is on track to increase its emissions up until 2020. Harper's government, while originally committed to reducing emissions, also disapproved of limiting oil and gas emissions as the price of oil rose higher. This was consistent with Harper's decision to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011. The main reason given for this by Harper was that Canada was not having success in meeting the protocol's targets. In the following years, Harper's administration made it difficult for environmental groups to operate in Canada. Environmental charities experienced frequent audits by the federal government which resulted in less productivity and being at risk of losing their charitable status. In addition; scientific institutions were eliminated, or were faced with obstacles such as reduced government funding, and rules put into place which made it increasingly difficult for government scientists to discuss their work with media outlets. Scientific positions including the National Science Advisor who is the point-person between the scientific community and the government, were phased out in 2008. Harper also repealed a significant environmental policy which had previously been in place; the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Later, a new version of the act was created, which critics argue allows the government to select which projects are assessed for their ecological impact and which are not. In 2015, with the election of Justin Trudeau, the environment became one of Canada's main concerns, with Trudeau eventually signing the Paris Agreement in 2016.  United States  Former President Barack Obama promised to make the United States more environmentally conscious, and implemented the Clean Power Plan, invested significantly in clean energy, and improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles; this reduced pollution and was also economical. Obama also made a joint agreement with China to reduce the emissions of both countries, and to reduce emissions in the United States by 27% by 2025. The current state of environmental affairs in the United States has changed drastically once again with the new Donald Trump administration. Trump has been open about his plans to alter or withdraw entirely from many climate change and environmental agreements the United States is currently involved in, such as the Paris Agreement. As this agreement is voluntary, the United States would face no penalty if they declined to participate. However, as the United States is the second largest emitter of carbon after China, their lack of participation in the agreement would greatly impact global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. While in 1999, President Bill Clinton announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would enforce the toughest standards to date, Trump's administration recently instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to remove the climate change page from its website. EPA employees have stated that if the page is taken down, years of research on global warming will be gone, as well as detailed data on emissions and links to scientific global warming research. On June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. would cease all participation in the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation. Trump stated that \\"The Paris accord will undermine (the U.S.) economy,\\" and \\"puts (the U.S.) at a permanent disadvantage.\\"  Mexico  In Mexico, the economy and population are putting a strain on the environment which has led to increased pollution and natural resources being depleted. Mexico has implemented an environmental, legal and institutional framework to minimize their negative impact on the environment, and it is now commonplace for sustainable development to be incorporated into policymaking. This has resulted in improvements in air quality in urban areas, where previously many more individuals were seeing the negative impacts of pollution on their health. As well, water management has become more decentralized, which has assisted municipalities in developing their own water and waste water infrastructure. This has also resulted in safer drinking water for residents of Mexico. However, there are challenges that persist for Mexico in trying to become more sustainable. One of these challenges is that policymaking needs to be accompanied by capacity building within communities to be able to put policy into practice. Deforestation is also still rampant in Mexico, occurring at one of the highest rates in the world. The OECD recommends strengthening the implementation of legislation concerning nature conservation and reducing pollution using inspections. OECD also recommends increasing the funding Mexico receives from private, public and international sources so that infrastructure, mainly concerning waste water, can be more effectively implemented. Investment in water infrastructure makes up approximately 50% of what Mexico requires, as only one quarter of urban waste water is treated. A recent collaborative development between all three North American countries is that of the North American Climate, Energy, and Environment Partnership. The partnership was announced by Justin Trudeau, President Barack Obama, and President Enrique Peña Nieto on June 29, 2016, at the North American Leaders Summit in Ottawa, Canada. The central pillars to this partnership include; advancing clean and secure energy; reducing climate pollutants; promoting clean and efficient transportation; protecting nature and advancing science and showing global leadership in addressing climate change.  China  Maoming China has been a city of local environmental dispute, surrounding the municipal government sponsored Para-Xylene (PX) Industry, which is a chemical used in manufacturing plastics, such as those in water bottles and polyesters. The industry has been promoted in Maoming for its economic benefits due to the jobs provided by the factories. Despite the industry's economic benefits, citizens began to protest in 2014 as there was increasing concern for the chemical's environmental and health risks to the citizens of the city. To counteract the environmentalist social movement, the government took action by creating an agreement that all civilians must sign stating they will not engage in protests or speak of the industry negatively, which high school students had to sign in order to graduate, as well as implementing an education campaign by providing lectures to the citizens on PX project.  Poland  In Poland, various methods of mosquito controlling through the use of chemicals have been in practice since World War II. The motive originally was to aid in the elimination of potential carriers of diseases such as malaria, tularaemia, and encephalitis, which were creating epidemic outbreaks. Today, the same method of elimination is being used in order to diminish the mosquito population in major tourist areas throughout Poland. Biocides are commonly used and regulated through municipality staff and officers of city councils. As well, several product's active ingredients, such as Cybermethrin, Ecofenprox, Deltamethrin, and Bendiocarb, type of use varies on the place of application. Typical warning labels caution negative impacts of these products towards natural water and bees are accompanied by another warning label stating \\"dangerous for the environment.\\" The current expectations towards pest control companies in Poland are that there is a need for environmental consideration through scientific studies. These expectations do not include areas that have a city permit to use products containing biocides.  Brazil  Increased deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has led to fires in areas where deforestation has increased.

It relies on auditory masking. Masking sound is not an active noise control (noise cancellation technique). Masking sound reduces or eliminates perception of sound. The technology is promoted as a widespread application to an entire area to improve the acoustical satisfaction, by improving the acoustical privacy of the space. This improves one's ability to focus and their productivity. Masking sound is analogous to light. \\\\- Sound Power and Luminosity \\\\- Sound Intensity and Light intensity \\\\- They both have spectral characteristics. The Built Environment 'Masking Sound' is promoted as reliable, consistent, accurate and precise solution to control of background sound in the built environment. There is significant and misplaced prejudice towards background sound (in contrast to background noise). However, there is substantial evidence produced and published by Beranek (BBN) and Cavanaugh (et al., 1962 Speech Privacy in Buildings) indicating that acoustical satisfaction of a space cannot be guaranteed without consideration of each of the three principle parameters of architectural acoustical design, formalized and established in the early 1900s by Sabine. The three principle parameters are known as the 'ABCs' of architectural acoustics: \\\\- A for Absorption -- Sufficient (but not in excess) absorption in the built environment. \\\\- B for Blocking -- Sufficient isolation of the built environment. \\\\- C for Control -- Control of background sound levels in the built environment. No single technique is effective in addressing every sound transmission path (direct, reflected, diffraction, transmission) and varies in performance on a case-by-case basis. 'Masking Sound' produced by a sound masking system can be used to reduce the impression of intruding sound (reducing annoyance, distraction). It can be used the improve acoustical privacy, synonymously used as speech privacy. However, there's a fundamental misconception in the deployment of a sound masking system in treating areas where there's failure in appreciating the difference between the perception of privacy and speech privacy. Sound masking systems are often relied upon as a basis of design upon with Sound Transmission Class (STC, as supported by ASTM E336) or Noise Isolation Class (NIC, as supported by ASTM E336) to ensure an appropriate level of privacy between contiguous rooms. Various organizations (ASTM, ASA/ANSI, GBI, LEED, ASHRAE, WELL, etc.) define unique categories for labeling of acoustical zones with purpose and/or function. Typical classifications consider: * Open office plans – open offices can be either too quiet (where someone dropping a pen in the next cubicle is distracting) – or too noisy (where the conversations of others in the office make it impossible to concentrate). Open offices can benefit from sound masking because the added sound covers existing sounds in the area – making workers less distracted and more productive. * Private offices – private offices and other enclosed spaces often appear to provide privacy but actually do not. Many times, walls are lightweight and do not extend to the ceiling deck – only to the ceiling tile. In these cases, sound can easily travel through partitions or over the walls. Sound masking can be provided in adjacent private offices, or in hallways outside of private offices, to ensure that confidential conversations remain confidential. * Public spaces – sound masking is useful for reception areas, pharmacies, waiting rooms, and financial institutions. Sound masking is provided in the area where conversations should not be heard – not necessarily in the area where the conversation is taking place. For instance, a psychiatrist does not want those in the waiting room to overhear a private conversation with a patient, so sound masking is provided in the waiting area: not in the psychiatrist's office. Masking sound is an effective solution in masking intruding noise. The masking sound spectrum (National Research Council of Canada's COPE curve) is generated to be comfortable and elevated in level to be conducive to acoustical privacy in the built and occupied environment and can be specified up to 48dBA (Warnock in Acoustical privacy in the landscaped office in 1973). It may be used as a noise control solution to mask unwanted noise such as intermittent sound from machinery (within the overall limits and spectra). Masking sound seeks to reduce the intelligibility of sound from a source by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. It is an effective solution to promote compliance with HIPAA and GLBA regulations. However, the masking sound produced by electroacoustical system may also be disruptive if the sound masking system is improperly designed, improperly commissioned, or not verified by a professional acoustician. Exteriors A number of cases exist where sound masking has been successfully installed for exterior applications, the most common target of concern being roadway noise. In one example application a large artificial waterfall was constructed as part of the garden exterior of an urban hotel in Santa Rosa, California. The waterfall cascades down an extensive wall approximately four meters in height and functions both for sound masking and as a physical barrier to road noise. Sound masking systems In-plenum The plenum is the space between a “dropped” ceiling and the upper deck for the floor. In-Plenum sound masking systems, which employ a network of loud speakers located completely within the plenum, were the first such systems developed – they have been in use since the 1960s. Plenum-based speakers typically range from 4” to 10” inches in diameter and generally face upwards, towards the upper deck. This is done to reflect sound from the speakers to broaden, as much as possible, the footprint from the speaker in the work area. This promotes a spatially uniform delivery of sound, reducing the perception of directivity. As with any commercial grade sound masking system, an in-plenum sound masking system requires proper layout design, commissioning, and verification of the performance. Disregarding the importance of any of these stages in implementation will result in a sound masking system that does not perform according to the specifications of an acoustician. Only the most sophisticated sound masking systems can control the background sound level and spectra of masking sound accurately and precisely throughout a space, made only possible with smallest zones (spatial limits around a speaker) and sophisticated electronics and software. Uniformity can be achieved by adjusting the acoustic output of individual or small groups of speakers. Adjustments routinely include changes in output volume and output spectra of individual speakers. To provide this adjustment capability, additional system electronics for individual speakers or for small groups of speakers are required. Direct field Direct Field sound masking systems have been in use since the late 1990s. The name takes after the mechanics of sound transmission which considers the \\"direct sound path\\" from the loudspeaker emitted towards the recipients (listeners) underneath. Initially used as an accessory for open office cubicles, direct field systems have been fully integrated into at least one open office furniture system and have been designed to be installed both in dropped ceilings and in offices without any absorptive ceiling systems. When installed in dropped ceilings, direct field systems use speakers that are mounted facing down. When a ceiling tile is not available, they are mounted facing down on any available structure, sending the masking noise directly into the intended space. Theoretically, direct field system would benefit from speakers that are omni-directional, meaning that they transmit energy equally in essentially all directions. However, direct field systems require tighter arrays of loudspeakers given the polarity of the emission of sound. Direct field speakers do not preclude the need for sound level adjustment nor spectral tuning - a misconception.

The museum is a great opportunity to experience and view the average Norwegian home and lifestyle in the beginning of this century and earlier. The museum shows different log architecture since the 19th century and earlier, but also farming/fishing and everyday tools used in this period. Every museum event is normally advertised daily on signs by the road. There are also guides for tourist groups. Vikevannet Vikevannet is a lake located about northwest of Sørvik. Vikevannet is formed by various small brooks from nearby fens, but mainly from its main water source from Vollstadheia. The outgoing stream/river ends by the coast of Sørvik, also known as \\"Sørvikelva\\". This river was earlier populated by salmon and sea trout, but vanished because of the lack of continuous heavy water stream and earlier pollution. Vikevannet is a popular fishing destination for families or fishing enthusiasts from all around Harstad and other nearby areas. The main population of fish consists of trout, Arctic char, and some freshwater eel (Anguillidae) The surrounding properties are mainly owned by local farmers or other landed property. Vikevannet is also a very popular bird destination, and you can often see rather rare (in this area) birds in this area including swan, black-throated loon, dipper, snipe, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian whimbrel, northern lapwing, and a variety of freshwater ducks and grebe birds. File:vikevannet.jpg|Vikevannet in summer. File:vikevannet trout.jpg|The most common guest of the waters is the Vikevannet trout. Metal community Sørvik is locally known as a \\"metal-community\\". The heavy metal music movement is connected to the youth of the village. There have been several well-known bands that have their roots in Sørvik. Examples are Cat Eye (who will soon sign their first record with a German company), Flame Thrower (who won Norway's biggest amateur rock-contest Rock Mot Rus in 2005), Eternal Silence and Monkey Business.

Origins and early career He was a descendant of Sir William de Staunton, or Stanton, of Staunton, Nottinghamshire, by Athelina, daughter and co-heiress of John de Masters of Bassingham, Lincolnshire. He seems to have held the living of Soham, as early as 1289; afterwards he held the livings of Thurston and Werbeton, and about 1306, on being ordained priest, received the living of East Dereham. In November 1300 there is mention of him as going to the court of Rome. Judicial advancement He was a justice itinerant in Cornwall in 1302 and in Durham in 1303. In the parliament of September 1305 he was a receiver of petitions from Ireland and Guernsey, and on 20 April 1306 was appointed one of the judges of the common pleas. On the accession of Edward II, Stanton was reappointed to the common pleas, and is frequently mentioned in judicial commissions. Chancellor of the Exchequer and Chief Justice On 28 September 1314, he was appointed one of the barons of the exchequer, and on 22 June 1316 Chancellor of the Exchequer, but continued to act as a judge, and was regularly summoned to parliament with the other judges. In 1323 he was made chief justice of the king's bench, and directed to discharge his duties at the exchequer by a substitute. On 27 March 1324, Stanton resigned the chief justiceship, and on 26 March was reappointed chancellor of the exchequer. He resigned the latter post on 18 July 1326, when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Stanton seems to have sided with Edward II, and in September Queen Isabella seized eight hundred marks which he had deposited at Bury St Edmunds. He was not reappointed on the accession of Edward III, and the proceedings of an iter he had held at London were reversed. Foundation of Michaelhouse As prebend of Husthwaite, York, and parson of East Dereham, he is mentioned as receiving protection on 30 January and 11 February 1327. On 2 March he had licence to alienate in mortmain the manor and advowson of Barenton to the masters and scholars of St Michael's, Cambridge. Stanton died in 1327, before he could give effect to his foundation, and the licence was renewed to his executors. He was buried in the church of St Michael, Cambridge; during the relaying of the chancel floor in the 1850s, de Stanton's sarcophagus was unearthed. His foundation of Michaelhouse was eventually absorbed in Trinity College, where Stanton is still commemorated as a benefactor and a memorial chapel survives.

Technically this animal is a pony due to its height, but in the Faroe Islands it is called a horse because of its strength. The Faroe pony is only to be seen on the Faroe Islands and is therefore little known in other countries. There are only 73 Faroe ponies left living on the Faroe Islands.  Features  The colors of the pony varies a lot, but are mainly chestnut, brown, black or speckled, with white also occurring in previous populations. It is known to be very an enduring, strong, friendly, adaptable and sure- footed pony breed with four gaits including the tölt, an ambling gait which it shares with the Icelandic horse.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 50–55 A fully grown Faroese pony weighs 250-300 kilograms. The wintercoat is very long, dense and water repellent, while the summercoat is shorthaired and smooth. History Faroe horses are an iconic image of the Faroe Islands The Faroese pony is mentioned in written sources from the 1600s. In the old days this pony breed was used to carry or haul heavy loads at farms and some sources also describes Faroese ponies trained to herd sheep (known as tøkuhestar). When it wasn't at work, it was released onto the mountains where it roamed freely. Today Faroese ponies are only kept by hobby breeders and it is mostly used as a riding horse for children. The Faroe pony has been on the Faroe Islands for many hundreds of years. In 1880 more than 800 animals were registered on the Faroe Islands, but by the 1960s the population had been decimated to only five to six horses. One of the reasons was an extensive horse export from 1850 - 1920, for use in the mining industry (as pit ponies) in the United Kingdom. A conservation and breeding program was initiated by Leivur T. Hansen and in 1978 the organization Felagið Føroysk Ross (Breeders of Faroe Ponies) was established. With huge efforts, the Faroe pony population has now increased to 70 animals which are declared genetically pure, with 14 male breeders and the aim is to maintain and develop the breed further. The Faroe pony has since been recognised as a unique breed.

The story is similar in style and tone to Heinlein's better-known story \\"The Menace from Earth\\". Plot summary Maureen, or \\"Puddin'\\", a strong-willed, intelligent teenage girl, observes the interplay between her parents over the mother's new-found enthusiasm for ice dancing. Maureen's father is an unworldly university professor, while her mother is a practical polymath who, amongst other accomplishments, designed and built the family home. Maureen's father goes on a fishing trip. On his return, he announces that ice dancing is a simple matter of applied physics, and that anybody can do it. A competent skater herself, Maureen watches in horror as he puts on skates and ventures out on the ice with a partner. As he approaches the critical first turn, she prepares herself, as she puts it, to \\"identify the body\\". However, her father negotiates the hazard and finishes the dance, not without a few wobbles. Later, Maureen announces to her father that she has solved the puzzle. His \\"fishing trip\\" was really a crash course in ice dancing. He could not stand to see his wife dancing with other, younger men, but was too proud to learn at home.

It became his debut work, a 56-page picture book published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1991.\\"The Houdini box\\". WorldCat. Retrieved February 20, 2013. Selznick won the 2008 Caldecott Medal from the American Library Association for the year's best-illustrated picture book, recognizing The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Its Caldecott Medal was the first for a long book, 533 pages with 284 pictures. Selznick calls it \\"not exactly a novel, not quite a picture book, not really a graphic novel, or a flip book or a movie, but a combination of all these things.\\" At the time it was \\"by far the longest and most involved book I’ve ever worked on.\\" It has inspired students to action, including a fourth grade class staging a silent film festival, and a group of fifth graders who turned the book into a 30-minute modern dance. The Invention of Hugo Cabret follows a young orphan in Paris in the 1930s as he tries to piece together a broken automaton. The book was inspired by a passage in the book Edison’s Eve by Gaby Wood recounting the collection of automata that belonged to Georges Méliès. After his death they were thrown away by the museum that he donated them to. Selznick, a fan of Méliès and automata envisioned a young boy stealing an automaton from the garbage. The Invention of Hugo Cabret was adapted as a film, Hugo, by director Martin Scorsese and released in November 2011. Selznick cites Maurice Sendak, author of Where the Wild Things Are, and Remy Charlip, author of Fortunately, as strong influences on his books The Invention of Hugo Cabret and Wonderstruck. Prior to winning the 2008 Caldecott Medal, Selznick had been a runner-up for the award, winning a Caldecott Honor in 2002 for The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins: An Illuminating History of Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, Artist and Lecturer.

GPL's branches have hosted many events, and offers numerous services for customers. Collections According to internal calculations, as of June 30, 2005, GPL owned well over 700,000 volumes of print materials, with a majority (over 400,000) being housed at the Central Library. Not included in those totals are a wealth of currently uncataloged items of local historical importance (photographs and ephemera.) GPL also owns a large body of non- English print materials, (specializing in Armenian titles), as well as a \\"Genocide Memorial Collection\\" of works pertaining to many of mankind's worst moments. History Library services in Glendale were first provided in 1906. The women of the Tuesday Afternoon Club, a social and philanthropic organization, raised money through a series of lectures to fund a library collection. The library opened in a renovated pool room at Third and E (Wilson and Everett) Streets with seventy books, soon supplemented by a State Traveling Library of fifty more, and served a population of 1,186. In 1907, the City Trustees passed Ordinance 53 which established and supported a library which \\"...shall be forever free to the inhabitants and nonresident taxpayers of the City of Glendale...\\" The first year the library had 251 books, 165 registered patrons, and a budget of $248.88. In 1913, a Carnegie grant of $12,500 made possible the construction of the main library at Louise and Fifth (Harvard Street). The building was completed and dedicated November 13, 1914. The building was enlarged in 1926. Between 1940 and 1942, two side wings were added, one becoming a children's library called the Hans Christian Andersen Room and the other housing Readers' Service. Downtown Central Library, prior to the 2016 renovation The present Central Library building opened on March 13, 1973, on the former site of Glendale Union High School and Glendale College. With it had over four times the floor space of the old structure. The next twenty years saw major changes in the City of Glendale and in library technology. The latest remodel has brought library users a larger Children's Room and a separate Audio Visual area. The new upper level includes an expansion of the Special Collections room to accommodate the valuable historical information housed there. The redesign of the Reference and Circulation areas has been specifically oriented toward better customer service. The creation of a Business Collection area and a Job Center recognizes Glendale's position as the third largest business center in California. Brand Library & Art Center Brand Library Brand Library & Art Center is the art and music branch of the Glendale Library, Arts & Culture Department. Facilities at Brand Library & Art Center include an art and music library, art galleries and recital hall. Activities in the Center's art studios are programmed by the Community Services and Parks Department. The Library is staffed by subject specialist librarians and has over 110,000 items, including books, scores, DVDs, CDs, LPs, and magazines. Brand Library is housed in a mansion built in 1904. Located in Brand Park high in the foothills overlooking Glendale and the San Fernando Valley, the mansion was built by Leslie C. Brand and named Miradero (The Overlook). The design is similar to the East Indian Pavilion built for the 1893 Columbian World Exposition held in Chicago and visited by Mr. Brand. The architecture is considered Saracenic, with crenellated arches, bulbous domes and minars combining characteristics of Spanish, Moorish, and Indian styles. In contrast to the cool white exterior, a Victorian decor was followed inside. It was designed by architect Nathaniel Dryden, brother-in-law of Brand, and it was completed in 1904. Mr. Brand died in the house in 1925. He bequeathed Miradero to the city, although Mrs. Brand retained rights of residence until her death. The will provided that the property’s should be used exclusively for a public park and library. Mrs. Brand died in 1945, and by 1956 the mansion had been converted into Brand Library. Ten years later, in response to the need for larger quarters to serve the growing interest of the community, the city council allocated funds to construct an addition to Brand Library that would include facilities for art exhibitions, lectures and concerts, as well as an art studio for classes and workshops. The new addition was dedicated in October 1969. The Associates of Brand Library & Art Center is a 501c3 charitable nonprofit organization founded in 1969 that has awarded art prizes in conjunction with an annual juried art exhibition, has received donations of art, and runs fundraisers to support the facility.http://www.associatesofbrand.org/ The Brand Library & Art Center was closed for two years for an extensive, $10 million renovation that was completed in 2014. The Brand Library & Art Center sponsors many events that are free and open to the public including art exhibitions, concerts, art & music lectures, dance events, films, children's events and library tours. The annual outdoor summer Plaza Series held June–August on Friday evenings is a popular community event. Computer Services Glendale Public Library offers many services to its patrons, both at the Central location as well as its branches. GPL Central provides free wireless broadband internet access throughout the system. GPL currently provides wired internet access through their 32 public computers at Central and many at each branch location. GPL offers classes on various software such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, in addition to their extremely popular \\"Computer Club for Beginners\\". The \\"Computer Club\\" class helps students of all ages learn the basics of operating a computer, searching the Internet, and using email. GPL also offers computer classes in Spanish and Armenian. Adult Reading Program The Glendale Public Library Adult Reading Program offers a unique approach to learning literacy skills. The program combines basic instruction with the adult students' goals, making it possible for adults who struggle with reading to learn and use the tools necessary for life, family, job and pride. Both those new to reading and those new to the English language can benefit from the Adult Reading Program.

He was one of the last of the great Gothic Revival architects, noted for his churches and their furnishings. He is well known for his stained glass, his use of colour and his subtle integration of Classical and Gothic elements which he described as unity by inclusion. Career Comper was born in Aberdeen, the eldest of five children of Ellen Taylor of Hull and the Reverend John Comper, Rector of St John's, Aberdeen (and later St Margaret of Scotland). He was educated at Kingston College, Aberdeen, Glenalmond School in Perthshire and attended a year at the Ruskin School of Art in Oxford. On moving to London, he was articled to Charles Eamer Kempe, and in 1883 to George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner. His fellow-Scot William Bucknall took him into partnership in London in 1888 and Ninian was married to Grace Bucknall in 1890. Bucknall and Comper remained in partnership until 1905. His ecclesiastical commissions include a line of windows in the north wall of the nave of Westminster Abbey; at St Peter's Church, Huddersfield, baldachino/ciborium, high altar and east window in memory of the dead of the Great War; St Mary's, Wellingborough; St Michael & All Angels, Inverness; the Lady Chapel at Downside Abbey, Somerset; the ciborium and House Chapel extension for the Society of St. John the Evangelist in Oxford (now St Stephen's House, Oxford) and St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate, London; the Lady Chapel at St Matthew's, Westminster; Lady Chapel and gilded paintings in the chancel of All Saints, Margaret Street. He also designed the main building for infants for St Mary & St John School on Hertford Street in Oxford which is now called the Comper Foundation Stage School. In 1936–38 he designed \\"one of his most famous and original churches\\": St Philip's Church at Cosham near Portsmouth. Comper is noted for re-introducing the 'English altar', an altar surrounded by riddel posts. Comper designed a number of remarkable altar screens (reredos), inspired by medieval originals. Wymondham Abbey, Norfolk, has one example. Reredos in Wymondham Abbey, designed by Comper Only one major ecclesiastical work of Comper's is in the United States, the Leslie Lindsey Chapel of Boston's Emmanuel Episcopal Church. The work is an all-encompassing product of and testimony to Comper's design capability, comprising the entire decorative scheme of the chapel designed by the architectural firm of Allen & Collins. Comper designed its altar, altar screen, pulpit, lectern, dozens of statues, all its furnishings and appointments, and most notably the stained glass windows. The chapel commemorates Leslie Lindsey and Stewart Mason, her husband of ten days, who were married at Emmanuel Church and perished when the Lusitania was torpedoed in 1915. From 1912 Ninian and Grace lived in London at The Priory, Beulah Hill, a house designed by Decimus Burton (1800–81), where he entertained friends such as John Betjeman. He had a studio nearby at Knights Hill, close to the world's first Gothic Cemetery at West Norwood. After the studio was destroyed in World War II it was relocated to a building in his garden, which had previously been used by his son, Nicholas Comper (1897–1939), to design aircraft. Comper was knighted by King George VI in 1950. On 22 December 1960 he died in The Hostel of God (now Trinity Hospice) in Clapham. His body was brought back to Norwood for cremation at West Norwood Cemetery.West Norwood Cemetery registers. Cremations, 29 December 1960 His ashes were then interred beneath the windows he designed in Westminster Abbey.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry.Williamson and Bujeiro 2004, pp. 3–4. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the acceptance by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht—the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)—as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD—Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 113–460, 483, 485–487, 492, 494, 498–499, 501, 503, 509. These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, — The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939–1945. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Scherzer 2007, pp. 117–186. Listed here are the 26 Knight's Cross recipients whose last names start with \\"I\\",Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 239–240. ordered alphabetically. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (), based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 112. Of the 26 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \\"I\\", one was later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and one presentation was made posthumously. Heer members received 16 of the medals, one went to the Kriegsmarine, and nine to the Luftwaffe. {|class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" |-  Name  Service  Rank  class=\\"unsortable\\" Role and unitFor an explanation of the various naming schemes used by the Luftwaffe, Heer, Kriegsmarine and Waffen-SS refer to nomenclature used by the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS.

He spent most of his career in his native France apart from a short stint at Ipswich Town.  Career  Born in Auray, Brittany, Le Pen began his professional career with Rennes where he spent six years. In 110 games, he scored once. Either a winger or central midfielder, he is renowned for his passing. He moved to Laval where he scored 14 goals in 50 games within two seasons. In 1999, he moved to Lorient, where in two seasons he scored 14 times in 63 games, scoring every 4.5 games. He stayed with Lorient until November 2001. Despite interest from Rangers F.C he was then transferred to Premier League side Ipswich Town for FRF 15 million (GBP 1.4 million). He only played once in the league against Bolton Wanderers, but got injured almost immediately resulting in only 12 minutes of play for the club. He made one more appearance that season in the FA Cup and another the following season in the UEFA Cup, but he never played again in a league game for Ipswich; it is assumed that he and his family never really settled in England.Profile on Yahoo! Sports After that short taste of Premiership football, he returned to France and joined Strasbourg permanently in 2003 after a loan spell. He scored 16 times in 105 games and scored Strasbourg's first goal of the 2005–06 season with a free kick.

Overview SleepResearch_Facility consists of the single band member Kevin Doherty. His music usually contains no rhythmic elements (one exception is \\"2.5\\" on Dead Weather Machine), but instead relies on spacious, extended, richly-textured sounds. Occasionally, true 'musical' elements appear in his work, such as sustained chords (in \\"c-deck\\" on Nostromo for example), but the majority of his compositions consist of evolving layers of manipulated noise and mechanical drones. He deliberately attempts to avoid any sonic elements which would be likely to disturb a sleepy or sleeping listener, such as sudden loud noises.Foreshadow Magazine interview The music of SR_F is also intended to create an aural environment which allows listeners to let their thoughts drift, being gently guided (instead of forced) by the music. The following advice is provided for listeners: \\"recommended playback level: just above quiet\\". A more detailed overview of SR_F can be found online. The works of SR_F are inspired by power stations, distant motorways, certain sci-fi movies (e.g. Alien) and various aspects of nature, including thunderstorms, empty frozen tundra, deserts, jungles and rushing water.General Info section on http://www.myspace.com/sleepresearchfacility Two complete albums (Dead Weather Machine and Dead Weather Machine Re:Heat) were based entirely on the manipulation of a three-minute recording of a malfunctioning Dimplex electric fan heater.

Biography Though of a German family (according to some, the relative of Joseph Colonsee Marco Mortara, Indice Alfabetico, s.v.), he was probably born in the Levant, and received his Talmudic education under Joseph Taitazak in Salonica. Ashkenazi first became rabbi in Egypt 1538–60, probably at Fostat, where, by his learning and wealth, he became widely known. Compelled by circumstances—doubtless of a political nature—to leave Egypt, he went to Cyprus, remaining there for two years as rabbi at Famagusta. A desire to visit foreign lands and to observe foreign peoples impelled him to give up this position and to travel. He went first to Venice, but a disagreement with the rabbis Meïr Padua and his son Judah Katzenellenbogen caused him to leave the city and in the same year to take up his residence at Prague (1561). Here—either because he was a rabbi, or, at all events, because he was a leading authority—his was the first signature appended to the constitution of the burial society of the congregation. After leaving Bohemia and proceeding eastward as far as the Crimea, Ashkenazi returned to Italy, not before 1570. While rabbi of Cremona he published there (1576) his work, Yosef Lekah (Increases Learning; compare Proverbs 1:5), dedicated to Joseph Nasi, Duke of Naxos, which was several times reprinted. Four years later he was again in eastern Europe, as rabbi of Posen. In 1584 he left that city to take up his abode in Cracow, where he died on December 13, 1585.  Works  Ashkenazi's printed works are as follows: * Yosef Lekach A commentary on the Book of Esther * Ma'asei haShem (The Works of God; Venice, 1583; several other editions), a commentary on the historical portions of the Pentateuch, written for the instruction of his son Elijah, and containing also a complete commentary on the Passover Haggadah, which has frequently been published separately * Eight \\"selichot\\" (penitential prayers), included in the Bohemian liturgy * A \\"tokhahah\\" (homily), published by his son. * His supercommentary to Nahmanides, and his critical marginal notes—said to number one thousand—on Joseph Caro's Bet Yosef, have not been preserved.  His individuality  Ashkenazi's personality was an extraordinary one. He may be called the last survivor of a most brilliant epoch in the history of the Sephardim. Although educated by a kabbalist, and a fellow-pupil of Moses Alshech, yet he was a student—if not a deep one—of philosophy and physics. As a Talmudist, such men as Joseph Caro, Moses Isserles, and Solomon Luria considered him of equal authority with themselves; however, when the rabbinical decisions of earlier rabbis ran counter to his own judgment, he never sought a sophistical justification for them, as was then the custom, especially in Poland. Valuable material for a correct estimate of Ashkenazi may be found in several of his decisions preserved in the responsa literature of the time. In Venice he decided that a man could be forced to a divorce, if, by immoral conduct, he had incurred his wife's aversion.Moshe Isserles, Responsa, No. 96 It was likely this decision which brought upon him the opposition of the above-mentioned Venetian rabbis, though he was connected with them, for Ashkenazi's son was Katzenellenbogen's son-in-law. From the standpoint of strict Talmudic interpretation, Ashkenazi's opponents were in the right, since his sentence contravened that of the Tosafists, who for the German-Italian Jews constituted, as it were, a court of last resort.  Controversies with Polish rabbis  It appears that Ashkenazi's fierce confidence and independence led to clashes with the rabbinic establishment in Poland. The following occurrence is one such instance: The rashei yeshivot (heads of academies) had forbidden their pupils to establish a rival academy in close proximity to their own. Ashkenazi declined to assent to this resolution, even when requested in the name of Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon ha-Kohen, the rosh yeshiva at Cracow. In a letter to the latter he claimed that, although the decision of the Polish rabbis was based upon the authority of Maimonides, he considered it unsupported by Talmudic literature and therefore deemed it as needlessly discouraging religious instruction. Ashkenazi even went so far as to question if indeed a great scholar like the rabbi of Cracow had truly requested this at all! Here too, despite the great respect shown Ashkenazi in his reply, the rabbi of Cracow responded forcefully at length, vindicating Maimonides' standpoint by erudite and astute references to the Talmud.Joseph b. Mordecai Gershon, She'erit Yosef, No. 19 Consequently, J. S. del Medigo is quoted as saying that although Ashkenazi lived and taught in Poland in his later years his work was largely unknown to Polish Jews for \\"his way was hidden from them, and they did not fully understand his views nor his lofty ideas\\".Nobeloth Hokhmah, Samuel b. Judah Loeb Ashkenazi, Basilia 1631, p. 46a Ashkenazi's wife, Rachel, died at Cracow April 3, 1593. Her epitaph, still extant, bears witness to her piety and benevolence.Monatsschrift, xliv. 360 His son Elijah published the liturgic collection, Zivhei Shelamim, and wrote a short elegy on his father, which was used as the latter's epitaph.

Ehrman, Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene (Osford University Press 2006 ), p. 188 The Gospels give the name Mary to several individuals. At various points of Christian history, some of these women have been conflated with one another.Scott Hahn (editor), Catholic Bible Dictionary (Random House 2009 ), pp. 583–84 * Mary, mother of Jesus * Mary Magdalene * Mary of Jacob (mother of James the Less) (; ; ) * Mary of Clopas () * Mary of Bethany (; ) (not mentioned in the Crucifixion or Resurrection narratives) Another woman who appears in the Crucifixion and Resurrection narratives is Salome, who, in some traditions, is identified as being one of the Marys, notwithstanding having a different name. In such cases, she is referred to as Mary Salome. Other women mentioned in the narratives are Joanna and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Different sets of three women have been referred to as the Three Marys: * Three Marys present at the crucifixion of Jesus; * Three Marys at the tomb of Jesus on Easter Sunday; * Three Marys as daughters of Saint Anne. The three Marys at the crucifixion Women at the crucifixion of Jesus, Hans Memling. The presence of a group of female disciples of Jesus at the crucifixion of Jesus is found in all four Gospels of the New Testament. Differences in the parallel accounts have led to different interpretations of how many and which women were present. In some traditions, as exemplified in the Irish song Caoineadh na dTrí Muire,\\"Caoineadh na dTrí Muire\\" (The Lament of the Three Marys) the Three Marys are the three whom the Gospel of John mentions as present at the crucifixion of Jesus: * Mary (mother of Jesus) * Mary Magdalene * Mary of Clopas These three women are very often represented in art, as for example in El Greco's Disrobing of Christ. The Gospels other than that of John do not mention Jesus' mother or Mary of Clopas as being present. Instead they name Mary of Jacob (Mark and Matthew), Salome (Mark), and the mother of the sons of Zebedee (Matthew). This had led some to interpret that Mary of James is Mary Clopas and also “Mary, his mother’s sister,” and that (Mary) Salome is the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The three Marys at the tomb This name is used for a group of three women who came to the sepulchre of Jesus. In Eastern Orthodoxy they are among the Myrrhbearers, a group that traditionally includes a much larger number of people. All four gospels mention women going to the tomb of Jesus, but only mentions the three that this tradition interprets as bearing the name Mary: * Mary Magdalene * Mary of Clopas * Mary Salome The other gospels give various indications about the number and identity of women visiting the tomb: * John 20:1 mentions only Mary Magdalene, but has her use the plural, saying: \\"We do not know where they have laid him\\" (). * Matthew 28:1 says that Mary Magdalene and \\"the other Mary\\" went to see the tomb. * speaks of Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary of Jacob, and adds \\"the other women\\", after stating earlier () that at the burial of Jesus \\"the women who had come with him from Galilee ... saw the tomb and how his body was laid\\". The Roman Martyrology commemorates Mary Magdalene on 22 July. On 24 April it commemorates \\"Mary of Cleopas and Salome, who, with Mary Magdalene, came very early on Easter morning to the Lord's tomb, to anoint his body, and were the first who heard the announcement of his resurrection.Martyrologium Romanum (Vatican Press 2001 ) Women at the tomb in art Lorenzo Monaco, The Three Marys at the Tomb (manuscript illumination of a 1396 antiphonary)Web Gallery of Art What may be the earliest known representation of three women visiting the tomb of Jesus is a fairly large fresco in the Dura-Europos church in the ancient city of Dura Europos on the Euphrates. The fresco was painted before the city's conquest and abandonment in AD 256, but it is from the 5th century that representations of either two or three women approaching a tomb guarded by an angel appear with regularity, and become the standard depiction of the Resurrection.Robin Margaret Jensen, Understanding Early Christian Art (Routledge 2000 ), p. 162 They have continued in use even after 1100, when images of the Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art began to show the risen Christ himself. Examples are the Melisende Psalter and Peter von Cornelius's The Three Marys at the Tomb. Eastern icons continue to show either the Myrrhbearers or the Harrowing of Hell.Vladimir Lossky, 1982 The Meaning of Icons p. 185 The fifteenth-century Easter hymn \\"O filii et filiae\\" refers to three women going to the tomb on Easter morning to anoint the body of Jesus. The original Latin version of the hymn identifies the women as Mary Magdalene (Maria Magdalene), Mary of Joseph (et Iacobi), and Salome (et Salome). Legend in France A medieval legendary account had Mary Magdalene, Mary of Jacob and Mary Salome,Kaye D. Hennig, King Arthur: Lord of the Grail (DesignMagic Publishing 2008 ), p. 149 Mark's Three Marys at the Tomb, or Mary Magdalene, Mary of Cleopas and Mary Salome,Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, Reorientations (Indiana University Press 1994 ), p. 97 with Saint Sarah, the maid of one of them, as part of a group who landed near Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in Provence after a voyage from the Holy Land. The group sometimes includes Lazarus, who became bishop of Aix-en- Provence, and Joseph of Arimathea. They settled at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where their relics are a focus of pilgrimage. The feast of the Three Marys was celebrated mainly in France and Italy, and was accepted by the Carmelite Order into their liturgy in 1342.James John Boyce, \\"The Medieval Carmelite Office Tradition\\", p. 133, Acta Musicologica, Vol. 62, Fasc. 2/3 (May–Dec., 1990), pp. 119–51, JSTOR Processional statues during Good Friday In various Catholic countries, particularly in the Kingdom of Spain, the Philippines and Latin American countries, images of the three Marys (in Spanish Tres Marías) associated with the tomb are carried in Good Friday processions referred to by the word Penitencia (Spanish) or Panatà (Filipino for an act performed in fulfilment of a vow).Jim Yandle, \\"Panata by Ramos Parallels Those Final Days of Jesus\\" in Ocala Star Banner (6 April 1980)\\"Yolanda survivors fulfill 'panata'\\" in Cebu Daily News, 20 January 2014 They carry attributes or iconic accessories, chiefly enumerated as follows: * Mary Cleopas (sometimes alternated with Mary Jacob) – holding a broomhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/37190760@N06/7053611121/ * Mary Salome – holding a thurible or censerhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/28098727@N00/3485771454/ * Mary Magdalene (sometimes alternated with Mary of Bethany) – holding an alabaster chalice or jar.https://www.flickr.com/photos/laurencebukas/5907234981 The Blessed Virgin Mary is not part of this group, as her title as Mater Dolorosa is reserved to a singular privilege in the procession. A common pious practice sometimes alternates Mary Salome with Jacob, due to a popular belief that Salome, an elderly person at this time would not have had the energy to reach the tomb of Christ at the morning of resurrection, though she was present at the Crucifixion. To date, this remains to be a geographical tradition that varies from one town to another. Another practice pertains to Mary Magdalene is sometimes referred to Mary of Bethany being the same person, in line with the long-standing tradition in Western Christianity that identified Mary Magdalene (probably from Magdala near Lake Tiberias) with Mary of Bethany, a place near Jerusalem, much further south.

Etymology This species is named after Alfred B. Lau who discovered this species in 1975. History Even though this plant was discovered in 1975, it was not described until 1990 as it failed to flower at the Huntington Botanical Garden. However, it flowered profusely for Alfred Lau in Mexico, as in several European collections, so Myron Kimnach knew that the plant represented a new species. In 1989, it finally flowered at Huntington and Kimnach was able to write a scientific description. Kimnach described the plant as \\"outstandingly attractive\\". Origin and habitat E. laui is found in Mexico (Chiapas). It grows as a lithophyte and an epiphyte at altitudes of 1,800 to 2,000 meters. Systematics E. laui is most closely allied to Epiphyllum crenatum and Epiphyllum anguliger. Cultivation E. laui is a fast-growing plant but is known to suffer from die-back of stem tissue. Myron Kimnach had to wait 10 years for the first flowers. However, it has been easily cultivated in Europe. In cultivation E. laui seems to prefer high humidity and soil moisture, as well as rather cool conditions. Plants have survived temperatures near freezing in Germany. As the die-back can be caused by a viral infection, it is recommended not to propagate cuttings from plants known to exhibit viral damage. Description Stems branching basally or laterally; base narrow to subterete for 1–2 cm, flattened portions linear, subobtuse, 5–7 cm wide, midrib prominent, crenate, often slightly undulate; areoles hidden by brownish cream leaves, 2 mm wide and 1 mm long, brownish cream; spines 1-3 (-5), 3–5 mm long, hairlike, brownish yellow; epidermis shiny green, smooth, apices often reddish or brownish. Flowers 15–16 cm long, 14–16 cm wide, opening in the evening and remain fully expanded for two days, funnelform; pericarpel inconspicuous, ca 2 cm long; olive green, tinged pinkish; bracteoles that subtend spare areolar wool and 1-3 thin yellowish spines; the remainder of pericarpel 9 cm long, yellowish olive, tinged pinkish or orange-yellow by light; bracteoles 1–2, without areolar wool; outer tepals recurving to nearly rotate or ascending, attached within 1,5 cm of receptacle, linear-oblanceolate, rather abruptly acute, 7–9 cm long, 5–10 mm wide, outermost reddish orange or reddish yellow, innermost pure yellow; inner tepals 11, forming a campanulate cluster, obovate-oblong, abruptly aristate, 6–7 cm long, 20–22 mm wide, outermost white tinged yellow, innermost pure white; stamens 4 cm long, forming a throat-circle at receptacle apex, cream; anthers light yellow; style 12,5 cm long, lobes 8, expanding and recurving, cream. Fruit oblong, (4-5) 6 (-8) cm long, 2-3 (3-4) cm thick at middle, carmine red, flesh white, pink when fully ripe. Seeds ovoid-reniform, 2 mm long, 1 mm thick, black.

As a result of interactions between the ectoderm and underlying mesoderm, formation occurs roughly around the fourth week of development. In the development of the human embryo the upper limb bud appears in the third week and the lower limb bud appears four days later. The limb bud consists of undifferentiated mesoderm cells that are sheathed in ectoderm. As a result of cell signaling interactions between the ectoderm and underlying mesoderm cells, formation of the developing limb bud occurs as mesenchymal cells from the lateral plate mesoderm and somites begin to proliferate to the point where they create a bulge under the ectodermal cells above. The mesoderm cells in the limb bud that come from the lateral plate mesoderm will eventually differentiate into the developing limb’s connective tissues, such as cartilage, bone, and tendon. Moreover, the mesoderm cells that come from the somites will eventually differentiate into the myogenic cells of the limb muscles. The limb bud remains active throughout much of limb development as it stimulates the creation and positive feedback retention of two signaling regions: the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) with the mesenchymal cells. These signaling centers are crucial to the proper formation of a limb that is correctly oriented with its corresponding axial polarity in the developing organism. Research has determined that the AER signaling region within the limb bud determines the proximal-distal axis formation of the limb using FGF signals. ZPA signaling establishes the anterior-posterior axis formation of the limb using Shh signals. Additionally, though not known as a specific signaling region like AER and ZPA, the dorsal-ventral axis is established in the limb bud by the competitive Wnt7a and BMP signals that the dorsal ectoderm and ventral ectoderm use respectively. Because all of these signaling systems reciprocally sustain each other’s activity, limb development is essentially autonomous after these signaling regions have been established.  Position and formation The Hox genes, which define features along the anterior-posterior axis of a developing organism, determine at which points along the axis that limb buds will form. Though limbs emerge at different locations in different species, their positions always correlate with the level of Hox gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis. All limb buds must also rely on other signaling factors to obtain their forelimb or hindlimb identity; Hox gene expression influences expression of T-box proteins that, in turn, determine limb identity for certain organisms. In turn, the activation of T-box protein activates signaling cascades that involve the Wnt signaling pathway and FGF signals. Before limb development begins, T-box proteins initiate FGF10 expression in the proliferating mesenchymal cells of the lateral plate mesoderm, which form the limb bud mesoderm. WNT2B and WNT8C stabilize this FGF10 expression in the forelimb and hindlimb, respectively. This FGF10 expression stimulates WNT3 expression in the above ectodermal cells – resulting in formation of the apical ectodermal ridge as well as inducing FGF8 expression. The FGF8 secreted by the AER acts to keep the cells of the limb mesenchyme in a mitotically active state and sustains their production of FGF10. positive feedback loop between the limb mesenchymal cells and the AER maintains the continued growth and development of the entire limb. In addition to limb outgrowth, the formation of a crucial signaling center, the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), in a small posterior portion of the limb bud helps to establish anterior-posterior polarity in the limb through secretion of the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The ZPA also plays an important role in initially specifying digit identity, while later maintaining proper AER morphology and continued FGF8 secretion – to ensure proper mitotic activity of the limb bud mesenchyme beneath. In chickens, Tbx4 specifies hindlimb status, while Tbx5 specifies forelimb status. In mice, however, both hindlimbs and forelimbs can develop in the presence of either Tbx4 or Tbx5. In fact, it is the Pitx1 and Pitx2 genes that appears to be necessary for specification of the developing hindlimb, whereas their absence results in forelimb development.Tbx4 and Tbx5 appear to be important specifically for limb outgrowth in mice. Relationship between hox gene expression and limb patterning Within the limb bud, expression of specific Hox genes varies as a function of the position along the anterior-posterior axis. The Hox genes are linked in four chromosomal clusters: Hoxa, Hoxb, Hoxc, and Hoxd. Their physical position on the chromosome correlates with the time and place of expression. This statement is supported by the knowledge that Hox gene expression is initiated during gastrulation in primitive somitic mesoderm by FGF signaling which effects the primitive somitic mesoderm cells at different times depending on their axial location during organism development—and is even further specified with other anterior-posterior axis signals (such as retinoic acid). Additional evidence for the role that Hox genes play in limb development was found when researchers effected Hox gene expressions in zebrafish by adding retinoic acid during gastrulation; This experiment resulted in a duplication of limbs. Although excess retinoic acid can alter limb patterning by ectopically activating Shh expression, genetic studies in mouse that eliminate retinoic acid synthesis have shown that RA is not required for limb patterning. Chicken development is a wonderful example of this specificity of Hox gene expression in regard to limb development. The most 3’ Hoxc genes (HOXC4, HOXC5) are expressed only in the anterior limbs in chickens, while the more 5’ genes (HOXC9, HOXC10, HOXC11) are expressed only in the posterior limbs. The intermediate genes (HOXC6, HOXC8) are expressed in both the upper and lower limbs in chickens. As previously stated, limb development is essentially autonomous after the signaling centers (AER) and ZPA) have been established. However, it is important to know that Hox genes continue to participate in the dynamic regulation of limb development even after the AER and ZPA have been established in the limb bud. Complex communication ensues as AER-secreted FGF signals and ZPA-secreted Shh signals initiate and regulate Hox gene expression in the developing limb bud. Though many of the finer details remain to be resolved, a number of significant connections between Hox gene expression and the impact on limb development have been discovered. The pattern of Hox gene expression can be divided up into three phases throughout limb bud development, which corresponds to three key boundaries in proximal-distal limb development. The transition from the first phase to the second phase is marked by the introduction of Shh signals from the ZPA. The transition into the third phase is then marked by changes in how the limb bud mesenchymal cells responds to Shh signals. This means that although Shh signaling is required, its effects change over time as the mesoderm is primed to respond to it differently. These three phases of regulation reveal a mechanism by which natural selection can independently modify each of the three limb segments – the stylopod, the zeugopod, and the autopod. Relevant experiments ;FGF10 can induce limb formation, but T-box proteins, Pitx1, and Hox genes determine identity By mimicking the initial FGF10 secretions of the lateral plate mesoderm cells, limb development can be initiated. Other signaling molecules are implicated in determining the limb's identity. #Placement of FGF10-containing beads beneath chick ectodermal cells results in the formation a limb bud, AER, ZPA and, subsequently, an entire limb. When the beads created limb buds towards the anterior region, forelimb formation coincided with Tbx5 expression, while hindlimb formation coincided with Tbx4 expression. When beads were placed in the middle of the flank tissue, the anterior portion expressed Tbx5 and forelimb features, while the posterior portion of the limb expressed Tbx4 and hindlimb features. #When chick embryos were engineered to constitutively express Tbx4 (via viral- transfection) throughout their flank tissue, every limb they grew was a leg, even those that formed in the anterior region, which would normally become wings. This confirms the role of T-box proteins in the type of limb that develops. #Knocking out Tbx4 or Tbx5 knockout prevents FGF10 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm in mice. #The Hox pathway affects Tbx expression, which in turn affects FGF10 expression. #When Pitx1 was incorrectly expressed in mouse forelimbs, several hindlimb-associated genes (Tbx4, HOXC10) were turned on and drastic alterations of the muscles, bones, and tendons shifted the phenotype towards that of a hindlimb. This indicates that Pitx1—through Tbx4—plays a role in the emergence of hindlimb properties. ;HOXD11 expression correlates with Shh signals secretion HOXD11 is expressed posteriorly, near the ZPA, where the highest levels of Shh signal expression occur. #When retinoic acid is applied to induce Shh signal expression, a ZPA is transplanted, or ectopic expression of Shh signaling is stimulated, HOXD11 expression follows. Cutaneous innervation of the right upper extremity. ;Mesenchymal cells determine limb identity, but the AER maintains limb outgrowth through FGF signal secretion These experiments reveal that the limb mesenchyme contains the necessary information concerning limb identity, but the AER is needed to stimulate the mesenchyme to live up to its destiny (of becoming an arm, leg, etc.) #When the AER is removed, limb development halts. If an FGF-bead is added in the AER’s place, normal limb development proceeds. #When an extra AER is added, two limbs form. #When forelimb mesenchyme is replaced with hindlimb mesenchyme, a hindlimb grows. #When forelimb mesenchyme is replaced with non-limb mesenchyme, the AER regresses, and limb development halts. ;ZPA's role in establishing polarity and further limb development The ZPA first specifies anterior-posterior polarity (and dictates digit identity), and then, by sustaining AER activity, it ensures that the necessary cell proliferation occurs for normal formation of a five-digit limb. #When Shh signals normally secreted from the ZPA are inhibited (either through use of tamoxifen or Shh-null mutants) the AER morphology, particularly its anterior extent, is perturbed and its FGF8 signaling decreased. As a result of Shh downregulation during limb bud expansion, the number of digits was decreased, but the identities of the formed digits was not altered. Relevant molecules Associated molecules include: * FGF10 – Initially, Tbx proteins induce secretion of FGF10 by cells in the lateral plate mesoderm. Later, FGF10 expression is restricted to the developing limb mesenchyme, where it is stabilized by WNT8C or WNT2B. FGF10 expression activates secretion of WNT3A, which acts upon the AER and induces FGF8 expression. The mesenchyme, through FGF10 secretion, is involved in a positive feedback loop with the AER, through FGF8 secretion. *FGF8 – Secreted by the AER cells. Acts upon the mesenchymal cells, to maintain their proliferative state. Also induces the mesenchymal cells to secrete FGF10, which acts through WNT3A to sustain the AER’s expression of FGF8. *WNT3A – Acts as a middle man in the positive feedback loop between the AER and limb mesenchyme. Activated by FGF10 expression, activates FGF8 expression. *Sonic hedgehog Secreted by the ZPA in the limb bud mesenchyme. Creates concentration gradient that dictates formation of the five distinct digits. Digit 5 (pinkie) results from exposure to high Shh concentrations, while digit 1 (thumb) on the opposite end of the spectrum develops in response to low concentrations of Shh. Shh expression has been shown in many, but not all circumstances, to be heavily connected with Hox gene expression. Shh also (via Gremlin) blocks bone morphogenic protein (BMP) activity. By blocking BMP activity, FGF expression in the AER is maintained. *Tbx4, Tbx5 – Involved with the development of hindlimbs versus forelimbs. Though in chicks, they seem to be the primary factors involved in limb identity, in mice it appears that Tbx4 is merely a downstream messenger enforcing the hindlimb-forming instructions of Pitx1. Whether Pitx1 merely diverts a prospective forelimb from that path to become a hindlimb, or if Tbx5 is activated by another Pitx1-like messenger, is unknown. *Pitx1 – Responsible for the development of a hindlimb-associated phenotype. Tbx4 is one of its downstream targets. *Hox genes – Responsible for dictating the anterior- posterior axis of an organism, and are intricately involved in patterning of the developing limb in conjunction with Shh. Influences the activity of T-box proteins and FGF signals (and possibly Pitx1) proteins. Determines where limb buds will form, and what limbs will develop there.

The character also appeared in the live action movie Thunderbirds. Virgil's specialist expertise is in demolition, heavy lifting and logistics. Depiction Original series Second son of Jeff Tracy (instigator and financier behind International Rescue), Virgil was named after astronaut Virgil Grissom. Sources vary in the canon of the Thunderbirds series as to the character's age and birth date. In the factfile for the DVD compilation, Virgil's birthday is stated as 15 August 2002 or 2041, making him 24 years old. After studying at Denver School of Advanced Technology, he took up his role in International Rescue as principal pilot of Thunderbird 2. Besides piloting the delivery carrier of the rescue equipment he is usually called upon to operate the equipment and effect a rescue on site. Virgil occasionally pilots other Thunderbird craft, for instance in \\"Ricochet\\", Virgil is seen piloting Thunderbird 3 on return from Thunderbird 5 after helping sort out a communications blackout that put International Rescue out of operation for a couple of hours. Virgil is as dedicated to his calling as any of his brothers. For instance, in \\"Terror in New York City\\", when Virgil is seriously injured when Thunderbird 2 is mistakenly attacked by a US warship, his first thoughts upon reawakening are his alarm at the fact that his craft is out of service for repairs when it could be needed at any time. Furthermore, he later has to be ordered back to bed by his father when such an emergency occurs. His off- duty demeanour is much less boisterous than his other brothers, indulging in painting and playing the piano. Along with Jeff and Scott, Virgil is the only other Tracy to appear in all 32 episodes of Thunderbirds. However, he does not play a role in every rescue operation. He was also the first character to use the International Rescue radio code \\"F-A-B\\" in the first episode. Virgil was voiced by American actor David Holliday for the 26 episodes of series 1 (1965). When Holliday was no longer available, British-Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin provided the voice for the six episodes of series 2 (1966) and the two feature films. 2004 film Dominic Colenso portrayed Virgil in the 2004 live action film. As the film focuses on Alan Tracy, not much is known about this version of Virgil. Remake series David Menkin portrayed Virgil in the 2015 TV series. He is the largest and strongest of the Tracy brothers, and is skilled in engineering and mechanics. His character is calm and level- headed, and he is also the peacemaker in the family. Reception and influence Writing about the original Thunderbirds for Broadcast magazine, Ross Bentley praises the character: \\"Virgil was my complete favourite. He remains, in my book, the ultimate role model for any aspiring renaissance man [...] He not only painted but he was also an accomplished pianist. Forget Bobby Crush or Mrs Mills (my only points of TV pianistic reference as a child), Virgil was the business.\\" Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan is nicknamed \\"Virgil\\" for his likeness to the character.

Coming out of the second turn he took an extra two pedals before setting up for the jumps. This did not leave him enough time to make the transition smoothly. He hit the first jump of the rhythm section and his right foot became unclipped from that pedal. He hit two successive jumps essentially one footed, his still clipped in left foot taking the weight. He hit a fourth successive jump slightly obliquely and was launched sideways by his momentum into the air, coming down on the back side of a jump with his left foot still clipped into an SPD pedal. It was twisted at approximately a 90 degree angle from its proper position. Doctors almost amputated his foot.

She was laid down in 1917, launched in 1918 and commissioned for service in 1919, serving until decommissioning in mid-1945 due to extensive battle damage, and was to be scrapped in 1948 after lengthy war and peacetime service around the world. Service history After completion, sea trials and working up as part the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron with the Atlantic Fleet, Delhi served in the Baltic as part of a wider multinational intervention in the Russian Civil War against the nascent Soviet republics. Departing the Baltic, Delhi returned to Britain and spent the next three years with the Atlantic Fleet. She was to be chosen in 1923, along with her sisters , , and , for the Empire Cruise of the Special Service Squadron, representing the most modern and most powerful cruisers of the Royal Navy, as escorts to the battlecruisers and . Returning in December 1924, she was paid off from the Special Service Squadron and joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron with the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1925. After a brief ten-month detachment to the China Station, engaging in anti-piracy operations, she returned to the Mediterranean before being paid off to refit. On 15 November 1925, Delhi left Malta in the company of and and cruised to \\"southern skies\\" on a goodwill cruise which, from contemporary photographic sources, included Ceylon; Fremantle, Hobart, Jervis Bay, and Sydney (Australia); Christchurch and Wellington (New Zealand). The 1930s dawned with Delhi cruising the Caribbean as part of the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the America and West Indies Station. During the Carib War, Delhis guns were called to deter the actions of local insurgents on Dominica and landed a detachment of Royal Marines. As flagship, 8th Cruiser Squadron, she would once more operate in concert with Hood and Repulse during a visit to the West Indies, along with their escorts, the heavy cruisers and . Her West Indies service ended in 1933, and she deployed with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, once again serving with the Mediterranean Fleet. HMS Delhi voyage map, May 1932 Based at Malta at this time, with the Spanish Civil War raging, Delhi operated off Spain, picking up refugees from Palma de Mallorca, Barcelona and Valencia, under the command of Captain Farquhar Smith RAN. During these operations, she was engaged by the Nationalist heavy cruiser , coming under heavy fire, as well as suffering from aerial attacks. When World War II broke out, Delhi was freshly out of reserve, and joined the 11th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, the night of the sinking of , Delhi had just departed for a periodic sweep of the North Sea to enforce the blockade of Germany. While patrolling the Iceland-Faroes Gap, Delhi captured the freighter Rheingold, and then intercepted and assisted in the scuttling of the blockade- runner Mecklenburg, whose crew scuttled the merchant vessel, and abandoned ship. Delhis captain decided that boarding to attempt to salvage the ship was impractical due to the sea state, and instead sank Mecklenburg with gunfire. Sortieing from Scapa Flow on patrol on 23 November 1939, she joined the cruisers , , and the armed merchant cruiser Rawalpindi. During this patrol, Rawalpindi encountered the German battleships and , and was sunk in a furious hour-long surface action. However, with Newcastle and Delhi shadowing and the rapid approach of heavy units of the Home Fleet, Admiral Marschall withdrew his battleships into inclement weather, slipping his pursuers and retreating to Wilhelmshaven. Deployed to the Mediterranean in March 1940, Delhi undertook extensive operations as part of Force H against Vichy and Italian forces in Italy and North Africa. After five months service in the Mediterranean, she joined Force M at Freetown, operating off West Africa and in the South Atlantic. Delhi and her sister ship Dragon participated in Operation Menace, the Battle of Dakar, and then continued in the trade protection role in the South Atlantic. Bomb damage to the stern of HMS Delhi during operations in North Africa From May to December, 1941 Delhi was refitted as an anti-aircraft cruiser at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This refit included 5-inch/38 calibre guns originally intended for the US destroyer , and were hand-picked by Edisons commanding officer, but were transferred to Delhi on the direct instructions President Roosevelt. With her new dual purpose main armament, she provided shore bombardment and AA support for a number of Allied landings in the Mediterranean, (Algiers, Sicily, Salerno and the Anzio Landings). On 20 November 1942 Delhi was damaged by enemy action in Algiers Bay when her stern was blown open by a bomb dropped by Italian aircraft. Two crewmen were killed in the attack.http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1942-11NOV2.htm She returned to Britain and was under repair until April 1943. On 3 September 1943, six days before the Landings at Salerno, she collided with the cruiser in the Straits of Messina whilst laying a smokescreen. She was repaired at sea and remained in service for the landings where she provided shore bombardment and AA support. Continuing to serve through the rest of the war, Delhi took part in Operation Dragoon, a follow-up to D-Day in the South of France to utilise Free French troops and to open new supply routes to Allied forces in Europe. On 12 February 1945 she was attacked by German explosive motorboats in the harbour at Split, Croatia, where she had, three months beforehand, hosted the German surrender. The attack missed Delhi and struck LCF-8, a Landing Craft Flak. The force of the resulting explosion damaged Delhis rudder and a propeller shaft bracket. Anti-aircraft involvement The British HACS and FKS anti-aircraft fire control systems were less than satisfactory in service during World War II. While Delhi was in refit the British asked that the U.S. Navy's MK 37 Gun Fire Control System be installed as a test bed along with the 5-inch/38 calibre guns. The results were most impressive to the service and a request was issued for 42 of the systems to be sent to the Royal Navy for installations on their ships. They would see service in , aircraft carriers, and the s. The resulting installations were carried out and a further 40 units were asked for. The war ended before the second order could be filled. Delhis contribution in this area was thus substantive.Naval Anti=Aircraft Guns and Gunnery, Norman Friedman location 6524 Disposal Delhi returned to Britain and was laid up after the war. She was assessed as uneconomic to fully repair as an aged design in a rapidly downsizing Royal Navy, and was instead sold on 22 January 1948 to be broken up. She arrived at the yards of Cashmore, of Newport, Wales in April 1948 to be scrapped.

He was an active board member from 1947 to 1972, an emeritus board member from 1972 to 1978, a Presidential Councillor and one of the university's preeminent benefactors. He was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity. The I. M. Pei designed Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art on the Cornell campus is named for him. SC Johnson & Son Johnson took over leadership of SC Johnson & Son from his father Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr. and served as its president. He passed it to his son, Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr.. Johnson Wax Administration Building In 1936, he hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design a new administration building for his company in Racine, Wisconsin. His home Soon after the commission for the administration building, Johnson commissioned Wright to build him a home on nearby farmland. The result, known as Wingspread, was built in 1938-39 near Racine, Wisconsin. It was donated by Johnson and his wife, Irene Purcell to The Johnson Family Foundation in 1959 as an international educational conference facility. Film In 1935 Johnson flew from Milwaukee to Fortaleza, Ceará, in an amphibious twin-engine Sikorsky S-38. The trip was to learn more about the carnauba palm tree (Copernicia prunifera) of north eastern Brazil which produced carnauba wax, one of the main products of his company, and to determine whether groves of these trees could produce enough to meet future demand. This led to investments in Brazil, establishment of a subsidiary in 1960, and eventually to the foundation of the Serra das Almas Private Natural Heritage Reserve to protect an area of the caatinga biome including wild carnauba palms. His 1935 two month, 7,500 mile journey to northeastern Brazil as well as his somewhat difficult relationship with his son, Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr., was documented in his son's 2001 film Carnuba: A Son's Memoir. The film includes footage from a repeat of that journey that the Johnson family undertook in 1998.  Personal life  Johnson was married three times. He married his first wife, the former Gertrude Brauner, daughter of Cornell University professor Olaf Brauner, in 1923. They were the parents of three children, Karen (b. 16 May 1924), Henrietta (b. 16 April 1927) and Samuel Curtis Jr.(b. 2 March 1928). Herbert and Gertrude were divorced about 1931; their middle daughter Henrietta also died in 1931 (30 March).

A previous Dodge 100, known informally as the \\"parrot-nose\\" or \\"Kew Dodge\\", was produced in the 1950s at a factory in Kew, London.http://rustytrucks.tripod.com/id15.html History and development Originally developed by Commer, the range was first built as a concept in 1965-66, to replace the Commer VC and VE range with gross vehicle weight (GVW). As Chrysler Europe acquired a controlling interest in Commer's owner, the Rootes Group, the truck design and name were changed to complement the Dodge 500 trucks. Drivetrains The Dodge 100 was intended to use a Rootes diesel engine, but noise regulations ruled out the reliable but noisy Rootes units. In the end, naturally aspirated and turbocharged four- and six-cylinder Perkins diesel engines (locally made in the UK) were used for lighter weights, with the Mercedes-Benz OM352 offered as a premium engine (due largely to the reputation of Mercedes in Europe, where Perkins was relatively unknown). Also, Valmet 611 CS diesels were installed for some limited market areas. Four-, five-, and six-speed synchromesh manual transmissions from Rootes were used, while rear axles are a mixture of Rootes Groups' own hypoid design and Eaton Corporation's single- and two-speed axles. The chassis use a special alloy for greater strength and lighter weight. Final capacity ranges from GVW for full vehicles and 24/28 tons GCW for tractors. Renault Dodge-Renault 100 Mk 2 with double badging The 100 Series was in production for around 15 years in most areas of the world (though not in the United States, due to the costs that would have been involved in meeting local regulations). It was sold as a Commer, Dodge, DeSoto, Fargo and Renault. A \\"Mark 2\\" version has an upgraded engine other minor refinements. Eventually the Dodge 100 was eliminated by Renault, which had acquired the former Rootes Group truck operations after the car operations were purchased by Peugeot, though a Renault version of the Dodge 100 was built for a time; by 1987, it was being marketed as simply the \\"Renault Commando\\". Renault later switched production at the former Rootes factory to Renault's own bus and truck engines.

Biography Meïr ben Isaac, who was often called after his native town, was the founder of the Katzenellenbogen family. After studying at Prague under the well-known casuist Jacob Pollak, he went to Padua and entered the yeshiva of Judah Minz, whose granddaughter, Hannah, he afterwards married. He succeeded his father-in-law, Abraham Minz, in the chief rabbinate of Padua, which office he held until his death on 12 January 1565 (epitaph below). He was the father of Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen. Meïr was also nominal rabbi of Venice, where he went several times a year,according to his Responsa (Nos. 43, 48, etc.) but he had his fixed residence at Padua. Meïr was considered by his contemporaries a great authority on Talmudic and rabbinical matters, and many rabbis consulted him, among them: Moses Alashkar, Obadiah Sforno, and his relative Moses Isserles (who addressed him as \\"rabbi of Venice\\"). It may be seen from his responsa (ninety in number, published by himself, with those of Judah Minz, under the title of She'elot u-Teshubot, Venice, 1553), as well as from those of Isserles, that he was disposed to be liberal in his decisions. Another indication of his leaning toward liberalism was his use in his responsa (Nos. 38, 49, 72) of the civil names of the months, a thing not done by other rabbis of his time. Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon says (She'erit Yosef, No. 1) that Meïr, in one of his responsa, told him not to rely at that time on his opinion, because he could not verify his decision by the Talmud, all the copies of which had been burned. This burning is mentioned by David Gans (Ẓemaḥ Dawid, p. 56, Warsaw, 1890) and by Heilprin (Seder haDorot, i.245, ed. Maskileison) as having occurred in 1553 or 1554 under Pope Julius III, at the instigation of certain baptized Jews. Meïr states also (Responsa, No. 78) that in Candia the hafṭarah for Yom Kippur Minḥah was, with the exception of the first three verses, read in Greek (comp. Zunz, G.V. p. 413, note). In Responsum No. 86 he speaks of the plague that raged at Venice, but without indicating the year. Many of his responsa are to be found in the collection of Isserles. Meïr added to the edition of his responsa his father-in-law's Seder Giṭṭin wa-Ḥaliẓah, and a detailed index. He edited also Maimonides' Yad, with some commentaries, to which he added notes of his own (Venice, 1550; see Isserles). Cecil Roth, History of the Jews in Venice, page 256. In 1549 Katezenellenbogen became embroiled in a dispute over the publication of a printed edition of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. Since Jews could not own printing presses at that time, presses were owned by Venetian noblemen and operated by Jews under the patronage of the non-Jewish owner. Rabbi Katzenellenbogen edited a printed edition of the Mishneh Torah to be published by the Bragadini press. That work was soon pirated by the rival Giustiniani press. Rabbi Katzenellenbogen appealed to his relative Moses Isserles, who replied that the Giustiniani edition violated the prohibition on Hasogas gevul, interfering with another person's livelihood. The Giustiniani parties denounced the rival publishers to the non-Jewish censors, leading to a massive burning of volumes of the Talmud and other Jewish works in the Venetian Republic. Katzenellenbogen was the author of ninety responsa published under the title, She'eilot U'teshuvot. Katzenellenbogen's epitaph reads: Three centuries after his death, the 10th day of the Jewish month of Shevat became widely recognized as a significant date by Hasidic Judaism. It is the anniversary of the passing of Rabbi Shalom Sharabi (1777), known as \\"the Rashash\\" and considered the father of all contemporary Sephardic kabbalists, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1950) and the date upon which the seventh Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, formally accepted the leadership of Chabad (1951).10 Shevat: A Day of Two Rebbes, chabad.orgTzadikim who celebrate their Hilulah during the month of Shevat, yeshshem.com His wife Hannah's epitaph reads: Some notable descendants Rabbi Katzenellenbogen had many notable descendants. *Herbert L.

It originally aired on the digital television channel BBC Three on 1 January 2007, alongside the previous episode, \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\". The episode was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Ashley Way. Continuing from the events of \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", the episode involves the time-travelling clock seller Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) manipulating members of a team of alien hunters called Torchwood into opening a rift in time and space which would cause the release of the demon Abaddon. The episode received three 2008 BAFTA Cymru award nominations, though none of them was won. Plot Synopsis During Gwen's (Eve Myles) morning off with her boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), they both see news reports of UFO sightings over the Taj Mahal, and an armed clash between CO19 officers and English civil war era soldiers. When she returns to the Hub, the team learns that they are caused by unstable rift activity after it was opened to rescue Tosh and Jack. Torchwood has its hands full; Tosh and Owen (Burn Gorman) investigate cases of the Black Death in a local hospital, where Tosh sees a glimpse of her mother, while Jack and Gwen are alerted by PC Andy (Tom Price) to a Roman soldier in a police custody. In that time, Gwen sees a glimpse of Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin). Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) sees Lisa (Caroline Chikezie), who tries to convince him to open the rift. During a heated argument, Jack fires Owen. While at a bar, Owen sees Diane (Louise Delamere), who tries to convince him to open the rift. Jack and Gwen go to Bilis' clock shop, \\"A Stitch In Time\\", where they learn that Bilis can step between eras in time. When Jack leaves, Bilis shows Gwen a vision where Rhys dies. Gwen rushes to Rhys and has him imprisoned in Torchwood for protection. However, Bilis causes a power cut to raise a security breach in the Hub, releases Rhys, and kills him. Gwen and Jack finds Rhys' body in a pool of blood, just like in the vision, and Gwen screams in horror. Jack tells her that they cannot bring him back, but she knows the only hope of restoring him is to open the rift. All but Jack agree to this, and attempts to stop them by holding the team at gunpoint. When he insults them, Owen attacks and kills him, and scans his and the team's retinas and open the rift. After Jack revives himself, they discover that Bilis has manipulated the team to open the rift, in order to release Abaddon whose shadow kills anyone who touches it. This gives Jack an idea; he cannot die, so it can feed off his life. The shadow attacks Jack, but a blue light flows out of his chest and destroys Abaddon, killing Jack, seemingly for good. The rift is now closed. Gwen is relieved to see Rhys alive. After several days, Jack is still dead, but is brought back to life after Gwen kisses him goodbye. The team welcome him back, (Tosh gives Jack a hug, Jack hugs and kisses Ianto, Jack forgives Owen and hugs him). Later Jack announces to Gwen that the rift is now more volatile than ever. Gwen questions him: what would tempt him to open the rift to which Jack replies \\"the right kind of doctor.\\" As the rest of the team go for a coffee run, Jack sees the Doctor's severed hand glowing. He then hears a familiar whooshing noise coming from above the Hub, and runs towards it. The rest of the team are perplexed at Jack's sudden departure, believing something has taken him. Continuity In the episode, much of the team see familiar faces from their pasts in order to convince them to open the Rift. Ianto sees a fully human Lisa from the episode \\"Cyberwoman\\", and Owen sees Diane from the episode \\"Out of Time\\". During the time where Jack insults the team before they kill him and open the Rift, he recites Gwen and Owen's sexual relationship, Toshiko and Mary's, Owen's fight with a Weevil, and Ianto hiding Lisa. A monster was sealed beneath the Rift, Abaddon. The Torchwood website questions if there are more like him across the universe,Torchwood External Hub Interface - Notes on Abaddon asking \\"Were there other beings like Abaddon? Are they also entombed underneath planets across the universe?\\" - referring to the Beast as seen in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Satan Pit\\". Like the Beast, Abaddon was described as having been sealed away \\"before time\\". Bilis Manger describes Abaddon as \\"son of the Beast\\", and the Beast also says that some cultures have used the name Abaddon to refer to him. The episode's end dovetails directly into the cold open of the Doctor Who episode, \\"Utopia\\". Jack sees the Doctor's hand's jar bubbling and hears the TARDIS' arrival on the surface and dashes upstairs; the TARDIS' materialisation and Jack reaching it are seen at the start of \\"Utopia.\\" The hand jar is missing (while the similar other jar remains) an instant later when Gwen tells the others that Jack is gone. The closing aerial shot of Roald Dahl Plass is set after \\"Utopia\\"'s cold open, as the TARDIS has left the water tower. Jack returns the hand jar to the Doctor in \\"Utopia\\".

Iain Clarke of Strange Horizons thought the episode \\"showcased every one of the show's worst excesses and precious few of its redeeming features,\\" and that the episode was \\"heir to the myriad unresolved tensions and neuroses which the characters have exhibited over the course of the season.\\" Paul Clarke of Outpost Gallifrey called the episode an \\"utter mess,\\" thought Abaddon was less interesting than the Beast in Doctor Who's \\"The Satan Pit\\", but praised the episode for Murray Melvin's role as Bilis.

Three men were shot when a total of 50 rounds were fired by New York City police (NYPD) in both plainclothes and undercover. Bell was killed on the morning before his wedding, and two of his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were severely wounded. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the New York City Police Department from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Three of the five detectives involved in the shooting went to trialA.

His fiancée, Nicole Paultre, told Larry King that Bell was studying to be an electrician and was unemployed when the shooting occurred. Shooting incident On the night of his death, Bell was hosting a bachelor party at Club Kalua, a strip club that was being investigated by undercover police over accusations that the owners fostered prostitution.For Owners of Club in Police Shooting Case, Years of Raids and Suits, December 3, 2006. The New York Post reported that Joseph Guzman had an argument with a man outside the bar, and threatened to get a gun. One of Bell's friends reportedly said, \\"Yo, get my gun,\\" as they left the club. Thinking a shooting was about to take place, a plainclothes officer named Gescard Isnora followed Bell and his companions. He alerted his backup team, who confronted Bell and his companions outside.

The defendants opted to have Justice Arthur J. Cooperman make a ruling rather than a jury. The ruling was handed down in a state supreme court in Queens.Officers Acquitted in Sean Bell Case, Tell Me More, National Public Radio, April 25, 2008 (In New York State, Supreme Court is the trial-level court of unlimited original jurisdiction.) A key defense forensic witness was Alexander Jason, a crime scene analyst and ballistics expert who disproved several of the prosecution's main points relating to the physical evidence. Among them was the timing of the incident. After performing tests with an NYPD pistol, Jason demonstrated that the 31 shots fired by one detective (Oliver) could have been done in about 12 seconds - not several minutes. Using high speed video during ballistic testing, Jason demonstrated that bullets fired through a car window would project glass both inside and outside the car and that this could be interpreted as shots coming from inside. Another of Jason's key points (mentioned in Judge Cooperman's written verdict ) was that the person in the back seat of Bell's car (Benefield) was not shot while he was running away as he claimed, but while inside the car. Jason used computer generated 3D models to display some of his findings. In his ruling, Justice Cooperman stated that testimony by Guzman and Benefield did not make sense. He also cited the fact that they had a pending $50,000,000 lawsuit against the city. After the ruling was made, the family, led by Sharpton and several others, went to Bell's graveside in Port Washington, Long Island for a memorial service. Although the officers were acquitted, they and their commanding officer were either fired or forced to resign on March 24, 2012. After acquittal \\"Slowdown\\" protest On May 7, 2008, Al Sharpton led a series of protests in New York City. Hundreds took to the streets in Manhattan and Brooklyn as part of the citywide \\"slowdown\\" effort led by Sharpton and his National Action Network. The crowd made its way to the streets, stopping the flow of traffic in many vital areas of the city. This led to police action and the arrest of over 200 people, including Sharpton himself. Sharpton was arrested without incident at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. Bell's parents, his former fiancée, Nicole Paultre Bell, and the two shooting victims who survived, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were also arrested. Civil case On May 18, 2010, U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York lifted a stay on the civil lawsuit brought by Nicole Paultre Bell against the City of New York. On July 27, 2010 a settlement was reached. New York City agreed to pay Sean Bell's family $3.25 million. Joseph Guzman, 34, who uses a cane and a leg brace and has four bullets lodged in his body was to receive $3 million, and Trent Benefield, 26, was to receive $900,000. The total amount of the settlement was $7.15 million. Paultre Bell said, \\"I believe the settlement is fair, but the most important thing is that our fight, my fight, doesn't end here. No amount of money can provide closure.\\" New York City Corporation Counsel stated, \\"The city regrets the loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the Bell family.\\" The head of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association said he thought the settlement was \\"a joke\\". \\"The detectives were exonerated ... and now the taxpayer is on the hook for $7 million, and the attorneys are in line to get $2 million, without suffering a scratch.\\" Guzman said the settlement did not change the underlying reality that the lives of Black and Hispanic men were not worth much in New York and that the incident was bound to be repeated.$7.2M settlement in Sean Bell wrongful-death case Newsday July 28, 2010.

The basic concrete structure of the stadium was built between August 2007 and February 2009, but work was then halted for financial reasons. The design was revised in 2013 with a reduced capacity.http://stadiumdb.com/designs/esp/nou_mestalla The stadium architects are Reid Fenwick Asociados and ArupSport, and the cost is estimated between 250 and 300 million euros. The design features a futuristic exterior, clad in aluminium and an interior of wood. It is being built on the site of a former factory in the neighbourhood of Benicalap. History The plans for the new stadium were unveiled on 10 November 2006, by former president Juan Soler and the club who unveiled details about the stadium and presented a short film about the stadium at the Museu Príncipe Felipe in Valencia. Planned capacity would have been around 80,000. The work on Nou Mestalla began in August 2007. It was due to be completed in the early summer 2009, in time for the 2009–10 season, but due to financial problems this date was never met. On 12 December 2011, the club announced that it had negotiated a deal with Bankia to complete the stadium and transfer the old Mestalla property to the bank, and that it expected to complete the stadium in approximately two years, but this deal later collapsed.http://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2011/12/12/acuerdo-bankia- acabar-estadio/147449.html On 13 November 2013, Valencia announced an updated redesign by Fenwick Iribarren Architects. The new design reduced the capacity to 61,500. It also reduced the underground car park and downsized the original design's full roof and elaborate façade. There were also redesigns of the interior decoration. No date was given for when construction would restart. However, the construction was not renewed since then. On 3 October 2017, Valencia announced they will begin negotiations with Valencia's city council to renew the project and complete the building process of Nou Mestalla. The stadium will lose 20,000 seats compared to the original design and a modified design. Because of this the likely capacity when opened could be 54,000 seats, 7th largest in Spain instead of 3rd largest when planned. Accident On 26 May 2008, four construction workers lost their lives following the collapse of some scaffolding on the Nou Mestalla site. At midday on 28 May, the UGT and CC.OO. trade unions called a five-minute silence for the tragedy, which was observed throughout the Valencian Community in all sectors of industry.

The \\"drug labeling\\" includes all published material accompanying a drug, such as the Prescribing Information which contains a great deal of detailed information about the drug. As of Release 4 of the SPL standard, 22,000 FDA informational product inserts have been encoded according to the standard. SPL documents contain both the content of labeling (all text, tables and figures) for a product along with additional machine readable information (drug listing data elements). Drug listing data elements include information about the product (proprietary and nonproprietary names, ingredients, ingredient strengths, dosage forms, routes of administration, appearance, DEA schedule) and the packaging (package quantity and type). Background Since October 31, 2005, labeling submissions to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) must be in SPL format. In addition, annual report submissions must contain content of labeling in SPL format. In January 2006, the FDA unveiled a major change to the format of the Prescribing Information (PI), commonly referred to as the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) format. The new format requires three sections. (1) The Highlights of Prescribing Information section contains selected information from the FPI that health care practitioners most commonly reference and consider most important. The Highlights of Prescribing Information includes a toll-free number and URL for reporting suspected adverse events and a Revision Date that identifies the month and year of the last change to the PI. (2) The Table of Contents lists the sections and subsections of the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). (3) The FPI contains the detailed prescribing information necessary for safe and effective use of the drug including indications, limitations of use, recommended dosage, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, clinically significant drug interactions, information about use in specific populations (pregnancy, lactation, females and males of reproductive potential, pediatric use, geriatric use), drug abuse and dependence, overdosage, and other information about the prescription drug. Starting June 1, 2009, the FDA required all OTC companies and Veterinary Medicines (Vet Med) manufacturers to submit their product labeling in compliance with the SPL standards. Additionally, all companies that produce Pharmaceutical (Rx), Over- the-Counter (OTC), Biologics products, Veterinary medicines, and distributors must provide FDA with all registration listing and drug listings in the SPL electronic format. FDA-approved SPLs can be viewed and downloaded from \\"DailyMed\\" on the National Library of Medicine web site. DailyMed provides free access to consumers and health information providers to comprehensive, up-to-date labeling as found in Prescribing Information. In 2009 the FDA and National Institutes of Health (NIH) entered into an interagency agreement to develop an SPL Image standard called the SPLIMAGE. SPLIMAGE is for image files of oral solid dosage forms that are submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with SPL documents. As part of an inter-agency collaboration with the FDA, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) studied the imaging of a broad range of oral solid dosage forms for pharmaceutical products. This study allowed the NLM to make the following technical recommendations for a SPLIMAGE file composition and format. The SPLIMAGE standard can be found on DailyMed. The SPLIMAGE database produced by the FDA and NIH interagency collaboration remains the most definitive collection of publicly available images produced for pharmaceutical products marketed in the United States of America. SPL Working Group The SPL Standard was initially developed by a small group within the HL7 Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee. HL7 is an independent and international provider of healthcare standards. PhRMA HL7 Task Group formed the SPL Working Group in January 2004 to further the work of the initial development team. Composition of the SPL Working Group :The group has grown significantly since its inception in 2004. Participants come from: ::* Industry sponsors of human and veterinary (pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, over-the-counter) products submitted to the FDA. ::* FDA representatives ::* Vendors ::* Health Level Seven International The SPL Working Group has a Technical Team and a Process Communications Forum. Additionally, a variety of subteams address specific topical and subject issues. Current subteams include: Biologics, VetMeds, Devices, Generics, Establishment Registration Lifecycle, Labeling Content Lifecycle, and Over-the-Counter (OTC) Products. These teams meet regularly, and meeting information and minutes of past meetings are available on the SPL Working Group All Sub-Groups wiki page. Current Objectives of the SPL Working Group :*Raise industry awareness concerning SPL (on-going) :*Sponsor industry webcasts and meetings, as appropriate :*Provide forum for discussion of issues, best practices, and FDA documentation of SPL :*Review changes to HL7 SPL model :*Review changes to XSL Stylesheet :*Produce revisions to Implementation Guide in line with schema releases :*Determine future direction of SPL Standard SPL specification outline Format Examples Use of LOINC, UNII, SNOMED-CT, UCUM, and other controlled terminologies Sections TBD.

Early life Boon Siew was born in Hui'an County, Fujian, China. He spent his childhood collecting pig dung (used as fuel) to make a living. Aged 12, he arrived in Penang from China with five friends, among them Loh Poh Heng and Loh Say Bee. He could speak only Hokkien and had virtually no formal education. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic upon his arrival. Business At age 18, Boon Siew purchased 11 buses using his $2,000 in savings. He reconditioned the buses and sold them for $12,000. Next, he used the money he earned to buy another 39 buses. In 1942, during World War II, his money was confiscated by the invading Japanese army. After World War II ended in 1945 and the Japanese were defeated, he started selling bicycles, tires and motorcycle accessories, and soon he expanded his business to used cars, transports and buses. In the 1950s, Boon Siew went into property development with his friends Say Bee and Poh Heng by building residential villas in Taman Saw Kit in Penang. His work is continued by his Boon Siew Group. Boon Siew arranged to meet with Mr. Soichiro Honda, the Honda Super Cub's creator, and quickly convinced him to set up a Honda subsidiary in Malaysia. The first Malaysian Honda showroom was set up on Pitt Street in Penang, very near the home of Boon Siew. The Japanese Honda Motor Co Ltd soon appointed Boon Siew the sole distributor for Honda motorbikes in the country, as the first 50 units of Honda 4-stroke Cub were being imported into Malaysia. A factory was built in Penang to assemble the Honda Cub and the Honda motorcycle assembled in Malaysia was renamed the Boon Siew Honda. The Honda Cub became the best selling motorcycle in Malaysia and Boon Siew was recognised as the first person to bring the Honda Cub motorcycles into Southeast Asia. The popular Cantonese word Cub 仔 (transcribed as \\"kapchai\\" in informal Malay), which means \\"small (Honda) Cub\\" and is now a generic for small underbone motorcycles in Malaysia, originates from the Honda Cub. Boon Siew also played a role in the brief merger between Kwong Wah Yit Poh and The Star (Malaysia) in 1974, and helped with the establishment of the Lam Wah Ee Hospital and the Penang Old Folks Home. He died at the age of 79 on 16 February 1995. To memorialize his contributions to the automotive industry, a road called Jalan Loh Boon Siew was named after him in George Town, Penang.

It is native to China, from Jiangsu south to Fujian and Guangdong, and west to southeastern Gansu and Yunnan.Flora of China (draft): Aceraceae The tree was originally discovered by French priest Armand David who was in Central China as a missionary. It was re-discovered by Charles Maries during his visit to Jiangsu in 1878. It is a small deciduous tree growing to 10–15 m tall with a trunk up to 40 cm in diameter, though usually smaller and often with multiple trunks, and a spreading crown of long, arching branches. The bark is smooth, olive-green with regular narrow pale vertical stripes on young trees, eventually becoming dull grey-brown at the base of old trees. The leaves are 6–18 cm long and 4–9 cm broad, with a petiole 3–6 cm long; they are dark green above, paler below, ovate, unlobed or weakly three-lobed, with a serrated margin. They turn to bright yellow, orange or red in the autumn. The flowers are small, yellow, with five sepals and petals about 4 mm long; they are produced on arching to pendulous 7–12 cm racemes in late spring, with male and female flowers on different racemes.

He was a prominent right-handed batsman and an occasional medium pace lob bowler. He was a good fielder who played in some matches as a wicketkeeper. Always known by his initials, E. H. Budd was one of sixteen children of William Budd and his wife Ann (née Hayward). His maternal grandfather was the Rector of Uley, in Gloucestershire. At the age of 16 he was appointed to a clerkship in the War Office, from which he retired early after approximately twenty years' service.C. A. Wheeler, Sportascrapiana: Facts in Athletics, Simpkin, Marshall & Co, London, 1868 (2nd edition) He first played at Lord's in about 1804 and by 1807 was frequently engaged in matches there.

He played for All-England Eleven versus Marylebone Cricket Club in 1804 and then made sporadic appearances until 1808 when his career took off. He continued playing until 1831. One of his early appearances was for the Gentlemen in the second Gentlemen v Players match in 1806.CricketArchive – scorecard of second Gentlemen v Players match He was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and that was his main team, though he also played for All-England and for various occasional elevens, including his own.

In the field he is credited with 173 wickets, 51 catches and 27 stumpings. C. H.

This game is also known as \\"Realms Online\\" in America. The game focuses on full Realm vs Realm team player vs player combat, with a three-way war constantly in progress over forts and castles. There are monsters and an element of grinding, but these are considered secondary to the war. The name Regnum means realm in Latin, and is also a tribute to one of the first games ever published in Argentina by some of the team members (which was named Regnum). It is abbreviated as RO or ROL (which in Spanish also means role, as in role-playing games). The game was officially released May 24, 2007.  Overview  Players create characters as their avatars in a fantasy medieval-themed persistent virtual world. Individual appearance of characters is customisable. The player has to choose between three realms: Alsius, Ignis and Syrtis, with each having their own races. Players then level up by grinding on monsters or with quests.  Steam Launch  Champions of Regnum was launched on steam in February 2013 to mixed reviews. Gameplay The inspiration for Regnum Online is the online game Dark Age of Camelot (DAOC). As such, RO is heavily focussed on Realm vs Realm (also known as faction pvp or team pvp) combat. In general, at all times a player can find active wars occurring in the \\"Warzone\\" where players of the 3 realms fight for control of forts, gates and castles. Players can choose the realms of Alsius, Ignis and Syrtis. Each realm has four races, and some of the races are essentially the same across the three realms. For example, each realm has a race of humans, and each realm has \\"lamai.\\" The differences between the races of the three realms is cosmetic as all share the same character classes and powers. Alsius is a snowy realm, Ignis is a desert realm and Syrtis is a grassy realm. Regnum offers the three standard character classes: archer, warrior and mage. Each class is further offered two specialisations. At present, the full range of classes are: Marksman, Hunter, Barbarian, Knight, Warlock and Conjurer. Combat skills, stealth and spells are drawn primarily from the lore of DAOC and Dungeons and Dragons, with much shorter durations and magnified effects. The movement controls take place by the use of the W, A, S and D movement keys or mouse clicking nearby locations. Each class has a unique skill tree. Along with many side quests, there are storyline quests that reveal things about each realms past and the war between them. Quests reward players with experience, gold, and some items that they could not obtain otherwise. There are also player versus player quests which require the player to accomplish a certain task such as killing a certain amount number of players from another realm or holding a specific location for a certain amount of time.  Development  Andres Chilkowski worked on Regnum, a real time strategy video game, published by Conde Entertainment Software in 1995. He was the team leader of the project, working with his friend. They wished to create an RTS game similar to Dune 2, leading to the development of Regnum. The friend served as a designer and script writer. After releasing the title, Conde would release a few more games before closing down from financial difficulties. In 2002, Andres opened up NGD Studios and started working on Regnum Online.

It was discovered on 13 August 1925, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory. The asteroid was named after the flowering plant magnolia.  Orbit and classification  Magnolia is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,222 days; semi- major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in September 1925, or one month after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Pan-STARRS photometric survey characterizes Magnolia as a common, stony S-type asteroid, which is also the overall spectral type for members of the Flora family.  Rotation period  Several rotational lightcurves of Magnolia have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. The best-rated lightcurve by French amateur astronomers Jacques Michelet and Maurice Audejean gave a relatively short rotation period of 2.9107 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.14 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Magnolia measures between 5.23 and 9.65 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.173 and 0.47. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts Petr Pravec's revised WISE results, that is, an albedo of 0.2839 and a diameter of 7.16 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.71.  Naming  This minor planet was named after a genus of flowering plants, magnolia, which was in turn named after Pierre Magnol. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Reinmuth's flowers  Due to his many discoveries, Karl Reinmuth submitted a large list of 66 newly named asteroids in the early 1930s. The list covered his discoveries with numbers between and . This list also contained a sequence of 28 asteroids, starting with 1054 Forsytia, that were all named after plants, in particular flowering plants (also see list of minor planets named after animals and plants).

Fleming first emerged from the West Coast art scene in the 1980s with the likes of visual artists-turned-filmmakers like Fumiko Kiyooka, Linda Ohama and Mina Shum. Fleming and Shum met as students in 1989 and have since remained close friends. It was through Shum that she first met actress Sandra Oh in 1994. Fleming later met Oh again at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014 and asked her to perform voice-over in and produce her animated feature, Window Horses (2016). The film is largely financed by crowdfunding through Indiegogo.  Stick Girl  In her early days as an animation student in the 1980s, Fleming refused to drop out of school after sustaining injuries from a car accident. Her severely limited mobility during recovery allowed her to draw only 'tiny little gestures' which led to the creation of her iconic avatar and muse, 'Stick Girl'. Stick Girl has two slanted black lines for eyes, reflecting Fleming's Asian heritage. Fleming uses Stick Girl to represent herself in her biographical documentary, The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam (2003). Stick Girl will also play Rosie Ming (voiced by Sandra Oh), an Asian-Canadian poet with Chinese and Persian roots, in Window Horses.  The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam (2003)  While recovering from the same traffic accident, Fleming acquired 16 mm film reels, home movies of her great-grandfather, the mysterious Asian magician, Long Tack Sam. Intrigued, she went to find out more about how a Chinese man could have been a successful vaudeville star during days of political strife and racial tension in the early 20th century who was, as the film later reveals, world- renowned, yet forgotten. As a narrator and character herself in the story, Fleming traces her grandfather's footsteps all over the world, from Canada to the United States, China, England, Austria and later back to Canada. Her journey for clarity proves difficult when contradicting origin stories of Sam emerge. Daniella Trimboli argues that instead of focusing on multiplicities, Fleming deconstructs the idea of singular truth by blending traditional documentary forms with her non-conventional storytelling techniques. Fleming does this by combining comic-book strips for Sam's origin stories and animation of characters in old photographs with interviews, first-person narration and old footage. The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam is part of a subgenre that Jim Lane calls the 'family portrait documentary' in which the boundaries of private and public histories intersect as the filmmaker's life interweaves with the family in focus, as an autobiography layering the biography of the family. An example as such is Fleming's profession directly affecting Sam's; the movies were overtaking vaudeville in the American mainstream entertainment business. Rocio C. Davis sees the documentary as an important project and product of Asian Canadian cultural and historical revisioning, a way for Fleming to claim for her ancestor, and by extension, for herself, a place within Canada's cultural and historical narrative. Trimboli also notes that the film can be a useful tool for engaging in cosmopolitanism with its 'persistent self-reflexivity' on the ideas and themes of cultural differences, ethnic identity, and orientalism.Trimboli, Daniella. (2015). \\"Memory Magic: Cosmopolitanism And The Magical Life Of Long Tack Sam\\". Continuum 29 (3): 479-489. doi:10.1080/10304312.2014.986063. In 2007, Fleming made a graphic novel adaptation of the film which won the Doug Wright \\"Best Book Award\\" for graphic novels in 2008 and had two Eisner award nominations.

He is the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh. He was formerly the defensive coordinator at Michigan State. He attended Youngstown State University and the University of Rhode Island. He earned his master's degree from Miami University. Career Early years Narduzzi began his career at Miami University in 1990 where he was a graduate assistant in 1990 and 1991 and where he tutored the wide receivers in 1992. From 1993 to 1999 Narduzzi coached at the University of Rhode Island coaching the linebackers from 1993 to 1997 and as the defensive coordinator from 1998 to 1999. From 2000 to 2002, he served as the linebackers coach at Northern Illinois University. He was defensive coordinator at Miami University in 2003 before joining the University of Cincinnati staff as defensive coordinator in 2004. Assistant coach Cincinnati Narduzzi became the defensive coordinator at the University of Cincinnati in 2004, and left in 2007 to coach at Michigan State University. Narduzzi was a candidate for the head coaching position at Cincinnati, but Central Michigan University head coach Brian Kelly was named to the post on December 3, 2006. Narduzzi had informed University of Cincinnati officials that if he was not offered a permanent head coach position, he would follow Mark Dantonio to Michigan State University as defensive coordinator. Michigan State Narduzzi was brought along by Dantonio to revamp the depleted Michigan State defense that previous coach John L. Smith left behind. Led by Narduzzi's stingy defenses, the Spartans improved dramatically, amassing four seasons of 11 or more wins, two Big Ten Conference championships, and six victories over rival Michigan in seven years. From 2011–2014, Michigan State was the only team to rank in the FBS Top 10 in total defense and rushing defense. Narduzzi was pursued for other jobs, including as defensive coordinator at Texas A&M; University and head coach at University of Connecticut. Narduzzi chose to remain at Michigan State and helped the 2012 team and the 2013 team lead the Big Ten in total defense. In 2013, he won the Broyles Award, which is given to the nation's best assistant coach. In his last game as MSU's defensive coordinator, the Spartans won the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic by rallying from 20 points down in the fourth quarter and finished the season with an overall record of 11–2. Dantonio said of Narduzzi after the game: \\"You want the best for your people. To win the last game like that for Coach Narduzzi was something that we could to send him out with and that will be a memory for life. He's been incredibly loyal here. He's an extremely hard worker. He's been extremely successful. And now it's time for him to grow. He'll grow as the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh. They're getting a great football coach and a great person and a guy who is going to impact young people. So it's going to be very exciting for him as well as his family.\\" Pitt On December 23, 2014, Sports Illustrated reported Narduzzi would become the new head coach of the University of Pittsburgh football team. On December 26, 2014, Narduzzi was officially introduced as the 36th head football coach. In 2015, Narduzzi led Pitt to an 8–5 record and a trip to the Military Bowl where they lost to Navy, 44–28. In 2016, Pitt recorded another 8–5 record as they went to the Pinstripe Bowl, but lost to Northwestern, 31–24. His second season was highlighted by two wins against top-five teams, a 43–42 upset win over eventual national champion Clemson and a 42–39 victory over eventual Big Ten champion Penn State. Pitt opened 2017 with optimism over QB Max Browne but endured a tumultuous season. After struggling in a 28–21 win over FCS Youngstown State and losing 33–14 the next week to Penn State, Narduzzi's defense faltered in a 59–21 loss to #9 Oklahoma State and a 35–17 defeat in their ACC opener to Georgia Tech. Despite wins over Duke (24–170 and Virginia (31–14), they also lost to Syracuse (27–24), #20 NC State (35–17), North Carolina (34–31), and Virginia tech (20–14). On Black Friday, Pitt shocked #2 Miami 24–14 and finished the season 5–7 (3–5 in the ACC). In 2018, Narduzzi led Pitt to its first ACC Coastal Division title after going 6–2 in conference play and 7-5 overall. Pitt then faced Clemson in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, where they lost 42–10. Pitt went to the Sun Bowl but lost to Stanford, 14–13, to finish the season 7-7. In 2019, Narduzzi led Pitt to another 7-5 regular season record, with a notable win over UCF, ending their 27-game regular season win streak.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2019/09/21/pitt-panthers- upset-ucf-knights/2405461001/ Pitt competed in the Quick Lane Bowl against Eastern Michigan University, winning 34-30 and earning Narduzzi his first bowl victory during his tenure at Pitt. Personal life Narduzzi is the son of Bill Narduzzi, who was the head coach at Youngstown State University from 1975 to 1985. Pat played football for his father in 1985 as a freshman. Narduzzi is married and has four children.

Many catalytic transformations, e.g. oxidative addition and reductive elimination, are proposed to proceed via intermediates featuring agostic interactions. Agostic interactions are observed throughout organometallic chemistry in alkyl, alkylidene, and polyenyl ligands. History The term agostic, derived from the Ancient Greek word for \\"to hold close to oneself\\", was coined by Maurice Brookhart and Malcolm Green, on the suggestion of the classicist Jasper Griffin, to describe this and many other interactions between a transition metal and a C−H bond. Often such agostic interactions involve alkyl or aryl groups that are held close to the metal center through an additional σ-bond.. Short interactions between hydrocarbon substituents and coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes have been noted since the 1960s. For example, in tris(triphenylphosphine) ruthenium dichloride, a short interaction is observed between the ruthenium(II) center and a hydrogen atom on the ortho position of one of the nine phenyl rings. Complexes of borohydride are described as using the three-center two-electron bonding model. PCy3)2(CO)3, featuring an agostic interaction. The nature of the interaction was foreshadowed in main group chemistry in the structural chemistry of trimethylaluminium. Characteristics of agostic bonds Agostic interactions are best demonstrated by crystallography. Neutron diffraction data have shown that C−H and M┄H bond distances are 5-20% longer than expected for isolated metal hydride and hydrocarbons. The distance between the metal and the hydrogen is typically 1.8–2.3 Å, and the M┄H−C angle is in the range of 90°–140°. The presence of a 1H NMR signal that is shifted upfield from that of a normal aryl or alkane, often to the region normally assigned to hydride ligands. The coupling constant 1JCH is typically lowered to 70–100 Hz versus the 125 Hz expected for a normal sp3 carbon–hydrogen bond. Structure of (C2H5)TiCl3(dmpe), highlighting an agostic interaction between the methyl group and the Ti(IV) center. Strength of bond On the basis of experimental and computational studies, the stabilization arising from an agostic interaction is estimated to be 10–15 kcal/mol. Recent calculations using compliance constants point to a weaker stabilisation (<10 kcal/mol). Thus, agostic interactions are stronger than most hydrogen bonds. Agostic bonds sometimes play a role in catalysis by increasing 'rigidity' in transition states. For instance, in Ziegler–Natta catalysis the highly electrophilic metal center has agostic interactions with the growing polymer chain. This increased rigidity influences the stereoselectivity of the polymerization process. Related bonding interactions sigma complex derived from (MeC5H4)Mn(CO)3 and triphenylsilane. The term agostic is reserved to describe two-electron, three-center bonding interactions between carbon, hydrogen, and a metal. Two- electron three-center bonding is clearly implicated in the complexation of H2, e.g., in W(CO)3(PCy3)2H2, which is closely related to the agostic complex shown in the figure. Silane binds to metal centers often via agostic-like, three-centered Si┄H−M interactions. Because these interactions do not include carbon, however, they are not classified as agostic. Anagostic bonds Certain M┄H−C interactions are not classified as agostic but are described by the term anagostic. Anagostic interactions are more electrostatic in character. In terms of structures of anagostic interactions, the M┄H distances and M┄H−C angles fall into the ranges 2.3–2.9 Å and 110°–170°, respectively. Function Agostic interactions serve a key function in alkene polymerization and stereochemistry, as well as migratory insertion.

The .22 Long Rifle version has a removable 10-round magazine, while the magazines for the larger .22 WMR and .17 HMR cartridges hold 8 rounds. The .22 LR and .22 WMR versions began production in 1997, and the .17 HMR version in 2002. Remington announced that the 597 had been discontinued in 2019.https://www.remington.com/firearm-history/model-597 Overview and variants The Remington 597, a competitor to the Marlin Model 795, the Mossberg 702 Plinkster, and the Ruger 10/22, was available in a number of configurations, with both synthetic and laminated wood stock options. The standard barrel length is 20 inches. Its unique bolt-guidance system uses two steel guide rails, and the bolt locks in the open position when the last round is fired. The receiver has integral 11 mm dovetail rail (sometimes called \\"tip-off\\" mounts), as well as pre-drilled and tapped mount points that will accommodate an optional Weaver-style scope base. The \\"tip- off\\" mounts are suitable only for small, light scopes for air rifle or rimfire use. For heavier scopes, the Weaver base is recommended rather than the tip- off mounts, since the greater mass may cause the scope to shift and \\"lose zero.\\" A target model is available with a 16.5-inch bull barrel with no sights, as well as a \\"tactical\\" variant that is all black with a threaded barrel tip to accommodate a flash hider, muzzle brake or suppressor. Two exclusive models sold by Dick's Sporting Goods come with a 3–9× scope, with one having a 20-inch bull barrel. Remington 597 HB 16.5 inch barrel with a green stock Magazines The 597 had at least four generations of magazines. Early magazines were made of plastic and caused a number of feeding problems when loaded with more than three to four rounds. This early magazine was seen as a major detractor to what was otherwise a good rifle. As the magazine aged and dirt, oil and unburned powder got ground into the magazine and the follower, the feeding problems could increase. The second generation of magazines was made from investment-cast aluminum alloy. These were available for purchase in the year 2000. The base cap and follower were still made of plastic. This new magazine was a great improvement over the first generation. The new-style magazine was shipped with the later rifles. These magazines were also available separately for purchase. The third generation of magazines was very similar to the second generation with only small differences, but a noticeable improvement in reliability. Third-generation magazines can be identified by the number \\"10\\" stamped on the side; the second generation has just \\"10\\", while the third generation also has a circle stamped around the number.597 magazine comparison - RimfireCentral.com Forums The fourth- generation magazine features a black coating which is intended to improve feed reliability. Aftermarket extended-capacity magazines are also available. Aftermarket parts The 597 is gaining more aftermarket parts, but it still lacks the enormous variety of the Ruger 10/22, which is its competitor in the marketplace. There are now aftermarket barrels, iron sights, hammers and extractors available for the Model 597, as well as the magazines noted earlier.

The IRIS probe is inserted into a tube that is flooded with water, and the probe is pulled out slowly as the data is displayed and recorded. The ultrasonic beam allows detection of metal loss from the inside and outside of the tube wall. Principle of operation The IRIS probe consists of a rotating mirror that directs the ultrasonic beam into the tube wall. The mirror is driven by a small turbine that is rotated by the pressure of water being pumped in. As the probe is pulled the spinning motion of the mirror results in a helical scan path. One of the key settings in the procedure is to ensure that the ultrasonic pulse initiates in the very focus point at the center of the tube or pipe. An off-center pulse will show a distorted image of the tube due to the difference in the sound path for either side of the tube wall. For that reason there are centering devices that help the operator to keep the turbine centered at all times. The transducer utilized for the inspection has to be high frequency, high enough to bounce back at both the inner wall and the outer wall. The frequency range typically used for the piezoelectric transducer is from 10-25 MHz. Features *Field- proven and commonly used in boilers, heat exchangers, and fin-fan tubes. *Often used as a back-up to electromagnetic examination of tubes, to verify calibration and accuracy. Especially useful as a follow-up to remote field testing due to the full sensitivity near tube support structures provided by IRIS. *The IRIS probe must be moved very slowly (approximately 1 inch per second, or 2.5 cm/s), but it produces very accurate results (wall thickness measurements typically accurate to within 0.005 inch, or 0.13 mm). *Before the examination, tubes must be cleaned on the inside to bare metal. *A supply of clean water is needed, typically at a pressure of 60 psi, or 0.4 MPa. Dirt or debris in the water may cause the turbine to jam. *Works for tube diameters of ½ inch (13 mm) and up. Special centralizing devices are needed for larger diameters. *Works in metal or plastic tubes. *Through-holes are difficult to detect by using this method. *Operates at temperatures above freezing. *Can pass bends, but will not detect defects in bends. *Not sensitive to cracks aligned with tube radius.

Following the downfall of the Kray brothers, the Arifs were one of several criminal organizations who took control of the London underworld including the Clerkenwell crime syndicate and the Brindle family with whom they were engaged in a highly publicized gangland war during the 1990s. The Arifs themselves were considered the leading crime family in the London area throughout the late 1980s before the arrest and conviction of most of its leadership, including most of the Arif family members, for armed robbery and drug-related offences in early 1990s. In 2004, the Irish Daily Mirror called the Arifs \\"Britain's No 1 crime family.\\"\\"Comment: Drugs Only Deal Death and Misery,\\" Irish Daily Mirror, April 7, 2004 (LexisNexis).

After the demise of the Kray brothers, several criminal enterprises attempted to move into the vacuum left behind. The Arifs are known to be, or to have been involved in racketeering, drug smuggling, armed robbery and murders. The gang is led by brothers Deniz, Mehmet and Dogan Arif but more brothers are involved in the various operations. In November 1990, Denis and Mehmet, wearing Ronald Reagan masks and wielding shotguns, were arrested in Woodhatch (Reigate, Surrey) as they attempted to rob a Securicor van. Mehmet Arif, who was driving a pick-up used in the robbery, was shot by police, but survived. His passenger, Kenneth Baker, was armed with a sawn-off shotgun, and was shot dead as he attempted to open fire on officers.William Donaldson, Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics: An A-Z of Roguish Britons Through the Ages. Bekir Arif, 52, known as \\"The Duke\\", one of seven brothers in the family, was convicted of conspiracy to supply 100 kg of heroin worth £12.5 million in 1999 and given a 23-year term of imprisonment. Dogan Arif, also jailed for drug smuggling, is said to be controlling the family fortune from prison. Their family is said to maintain ties with relations in Turkey who oversee shipments arriving in mainland Europe.

Geography Rock Lake is in south central Wisconsin, at Lake Mills, Wisconsin in Jefferson County, Wisconsin approximately east of Madison. Rock Lake is a 1365 acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet (18.3 m). The lake shape resembles a slight figure eight with several distinct areas. South of the figure eight portion of the lake lies Bean Lake State natural area which is a protected marsh. Part of the south western part of the figure eight is usually covered in tall aquatic vegetation that reach out of the water. In the north western portion of the figure eight there is a sand bar which often has boats anchored and is swimming accessible. The Glacial Drumlin State Trailhttp://www.glacialdrumlin.com/Home.html runs across an old rail road bridge across the southern portion of the lake. The trail separates the lake from the marsh area to the south of the lake. Pyramid claims Rock Lake is perhaps most famous for its underwater rock piles frequently claimed to be pyramids built by the Mississippian culture at a time when water levels were much lower. Mounds shaped like pyramids exist three miles (5 km) east of Rock Lake in Aztalan State Park on the Crawfish River in the town of Aztalan, Wisconsin. The park has National Landmark Status. The mounds are thought to have been built by the Mississippian culture and it is speculated that the site at Aztalan was a northern outpost of Cahokia, a much larger city in present-day Illinois not far from St. Louis, Missouri. The waters of Rock Lake have been referred to as \\"Tyranena\\", (Tie-ra-nee-na). That name has persisted in the area and is used by businesses, road names, and a park that is on the lake. Beaches There are two public beaches Bartel's beach,http://www.lakemills.org/recreation/bartels-beach/ and Sandy Beach;http://www.lakemills.org/recreation/sandy-beach-park/ both are located in the south eastern portion of the lake.

It was discovered on 10 October 1925, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in Heidelberg, Germany. The C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 8 hours and is likely very elongated. It was named after the flowering plant Paeonia, commonly known as peony.  Orbit and classification  Paeonia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Themis family (), a very large family of carbonaceous asteroids, named after 24 Themis. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5–3.8 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,017 days; semi-major axis of 3.12 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed at the Simeiz Observatory in September 1925. The body's observation arc begins at Yerkes Observatory in November 1925, or one month after its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the genus of flowering plants, Paeonia, which comprises all perennial peony plants. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Reinmuth's flowers  Due to his many discoveries, Karl Reinmuth submitted a large list of 66 newly named asteroids in the early 1930s. The list covered his discoveries with numbers between and . This list also contained a sequence of 28 asteroids, starting with 1054 Forsytia, that were all named after plants, in particular flowering plants (also see list of minor planets named after animals and plants).  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Paeonia is a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which agrees with the overall spectral type for the Themistians.  Rotation period and pole  In December 1986, a rotational lightcurve of Paeonia was obtained from photometric observations by American physicist Frederick Pilcher at Illinois College. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of at least 6 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.5 magnitude (). Only a lower limit could be determined due to the short observation period. The observer noted that the brightness variation occurred within 2 hours or less. In 2014, Pilcher revisited Paeonia at his Organ Mesa Observatory and measured a refined period of 7.9971 hours with an amplitude of 1.00 magnitude (), a strong indication for an elongated shape. A modeled lightcurve using photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database was published in 2016. It gave an identical sidereal period of 7.9971 hours, as well as a spin axis at (155.0°, −50.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Paeonia measures between 18.63 and 23.092 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.048 and 0.09. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 17.95 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.09.

Institutionally, the Conservative movement rules on Jewish law both through centralized decisions, primarily by the Rabbinical Assembly and its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, and through congregational rabbis at the local level. Conservative authorities produced a voluminous Responsa literature. Conservative Jewish thinkers take the position that halakha can and should evolve to meet the changing reality of Jewish life. Conservative Judaism, therefore, views that traditional Jewish legal codes must be viewed through the lens of academic criticism. As Solomon Schechter noted, \\"however great the literary value of a code may be, it does not invest it with infallibility, nor does it exempt it from the student or the rabbi who makes use of it from the duty of examining each paragraph on its own merits, and subjecting it to the same rules of interpretation that were always applied to Tradition\\".Solomon Schechter, Studies in Judaism, First Series, 1896, Jewish Publication Society of America Conservative Judaism believes that its view of Jewish law as evolving and adaptable is indeed consistent with Jewish tradition. (See also, the various positions within contemporary Judaism as regards halakha and the Talmud.) Difference in methodology from Orthodoxy Conservative Judaism relies on a somewhat different Jewish legal methodology than is typical of Orthodoxy. The prominent Conservative rabbi Mordecai Waxman has written that \\"Reform Judaism has asserted the right of interpretation but it rejected the authority of legal tradition. Orthodoxy has clung fast to the principle of authority, but has rejected the right to significant reinterpretations. The Conservative view is that both are necessary for a living Judaism. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism holds itself bound by the Jewish legal tradition, but asserts the right of its rabbinical body, acting as a whole, to reinterpret and to apply Jewish law.\\"Rabbi Mordecai Waxman Tradition and Change: The Development of Conservative Judaism A major difference between Conservative and Orthodox methodology is the former's frequent use of Takkanot (rabbinic decrees), which is far more prevalent than among the latter. The Talmud states that in exceptional cases rabbis have the right to uproot Biblical prohibitions for a variety of reasons; it gives examples of how this was done in practice, e.g. Talmud Bavli, tractate Yevamot 89a-90b, and tractate Nazir 43b. #B'shev va'al ta'aseh. Rabbis may rule that a Torah mitzvah should not be performed, e.g. blowing the shofar on Shabbat, or blessing the lulav and etrog on Shabbat. These are not done out of fear that one may carry these items from home to a synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Shabbat melakha. (Yevamot) #B'kum v'ase. When there is emergency measure that needs to be taken, one may violate a Torah mitzvah, in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. Arnold Goodman writes \\"The example cited is Elijah offering a sacrifice on Mt. Carmel in order to turn the people back from idolatry. (Yevamot) #B'davar she'b'mammon. The principle of Hefker Bet Din Hefker, a rabbinic court has the power to declare an object, or money, ownerless. (Yevamot) #A Kohen may violate the Torah mitzvah ordering Kohanim not to bury the dead. The example given in Nazir 43b is that a Kohen may bury his wife, as her own father is dead and cannot bury her. Arnold Goodman writes: \\"In a famous tosfot, Rabbi Yitzhak explains that by Biblical law, she is not a Met mitzvah because she has other family. Yet since her relatives and family may have abandoned her, the Rabbis regarded her as a Met mitzvah and even though a Bet Din does not have the authority to uproot a Biblical prohibition, in an instance where there is a panim v'taam l'davr, it is universally accepted that there is authority to uproot.\\" See the discussion by rabbi Arnold Goodman in Solemnizing the Marriage Between a Kohen and a Divorcee p. 2 (bottom) p. 3 (top.) Goodman notes that \\"Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... Later authorities thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate and necessary to uproot..\\" but then states on p. 3 that \\"Yet the right to uproot was never completely prohibited. There was often the need for an escape hatch, and the right of rabbinic authorities to do so was articulated by the Rashba as follows: It was not a matter of the sages deciding on their own to uproot a matter of the Torah, but it is one of the mitzvot in the Torah to obey the 'judges in your day' and anything they see necessary to permit is permissible from the Torah.\\" (Chidushai Rashba, Nedarim, p. 90a) Conservative Jewish philosophy does not allow the use of popular will to overturn Biblical or rabbinic laws. Like Orthodoxy, Conservative Judaism requires responsa citing a full range of precedential authorities as part of any halakhic decision. Changes in halakha must come about through the halakhic process. For examples of this view see rabbi David Golinkin's essay \\"The Whys and Hows of Conservative Halakhah\\", Elliot N. Dorff's \\"The Unfolding Tradition\\" (esp. introduction and chapter 1), Joel Roth \\"The Halakhic Process\\" (Chapter 1, but also throughout the entire book). A significant difference with Orthodoxy is that Conservative rabbis have produced a body of research on the history of halakha which, in their view, concludes that rabbis in every age have always included ethical concerns as a major part of the halakhic process. They hold that rabbis in practice viewed both halakhah and aggadah as inter-related domains, and that one could not be used exclusively without the other. See Roth's \\"The Halakhic Process\\", Louis Jacobs \\"A Tree of Life\\", and Robert Gordis \\"The Dynamics of Judaism: A Study in Jewish Law\\" (stressed in introduction and chapters 8, 9). The CJLS has on a number of occasions accepted teshuvot which include moral and aggadadic reasoning alongside and within a strict precedent-based halakhic framework. As such they sometimes come to conclusions that differ from their Orthodox peers. The CJLS cites cases in the Talmud in which Biblical laws became inoperative, such as when the Sanhedrin stopped meeting at its seat in the Temple in Jerusalem where it was required to meet in order to administer capital punishment, and the abolition of such practices as the rite of Sotah (the ordeal of a suspected adulteress) and the breaking of the heifer's neck in a case of suspected murder as precedents for refusing to administer Biblically mandated procedures on moral grounds.Rabbi Ellie Kaplan Spitz, Mamzerut, Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, EH 4.2000a, pp. 5587–585. Legal and literary sources As classified by Menachem Elon's Ha-Mishpat Ha-Ivri, the legal sources of Jewish law include Torah interpretation, legislation, and custom (minhag). The Conservative movement utilizes these legal sources as found in both pre-modern and Orthodox Jewish law, though it does not recognize the authority of Reform Jewish responsa. Through its own deliberations, Conservative Judaism modifies or adds to pre-modern and Orthodox halakha through several literary forms, primarily responsa. Such Conservative responsa may be given official force within Conservative Judaism through the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly. CJLS decisions may also result in a legislative decree or takkanah. Besides responsa and takkanah, the CJLS creates several other literary sources. For instance, the CJLS approved an \\"Organ and Tissue Donation Card\\" in 1996.Mackler, ed., 2000, p.471 For handling the agunah problem, the CJLS approved a Jewish marriage contract (ketubbah), supplanting a 1935 plan by Louis Epstein, prepared by Saul Lieberman).Gordis, p.159 In addition, Conservative halakha may be found in academic and popular writings, including an effort at codification (Isaac Klein's A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice). Finally, the movement's major liturgical publications—its prayer books and new chumash – constitute de facto halakhic choices about Conservative Jewish religious practice. In Israel, the Masorti movement recognizes the sources of Conservative halakhah, for the most part. In 1989, the first collection of responsa were published by three Israeli Masorti rabbis in the Va'ad Halacha (Jewish law committee) of the Rabbinical Assembly of Israel. As a matter of custom and rabbinical decision, the Masorti movement differs with its American partner on some matters of Jewish law. Conservative Jewish observance of halakha Conservative Judaism holds that both the ethical and ritual mitzvot (\\"biblical commandments\\") are normative. Conservative Jews are obligated to observe ritual laws, including the laws of Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), kashrut (dietary rules), daily prayer and Jewish holidays and life-cycle events, as well as guidelines in such matters as medical and social ethics. A gap exists between what the Conservative movement teaches and what most of its laypeople have incorporated into their daily lives. A primary source of such information about this gap is Jewish Identity and Religious Commitment: The North American Study of Conservative Synagogues and Their Members, 1995–96, edited by Jack Wertheimer (1997). In practice, the majority of Jews affiliated with Conservative synagogues do not observe the Conservative interpretation of halakha.Jewish Identity and Religious Commitment: The North American Study of Conservative Synagogues and Their Members, 1995–96, edited by Jack Wertheimer, 1997, Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism Conservative Jewish practice, however, is significantly stronger than that found in Reform Judaism, such as following Shabbat, Kashrut, life-cycle events and holiday observances.The Jews in the Center: Conservative Synagogues and Their Members, edited by Jack Wertheimer, 2000 There is a substantial committed core of Conservative Jews, consisting of the lay leadership, rabbis, cantors, educators, and those who have graduated from the movement's religious day schools and summer camps, that do take Jewish law very seriously. Recent studies have shown a marked increase in the observance of members of the movement (Silvestein, ibid.)The Conservative Movement in Judaism: Dilemmas and Opportunities, Daniel J. Elazar, Rela M. Geffen, SUNY Press, 2000 Specific decisions in Jewish law This section describes how Conservative beliefs and theory have been applied in practice over the last century. Conservative Judaism began with rabbinical practices similar to those of contemporary Modern Orthodoxy and somewhat laxer observance among its laity. Over the years, specific issues and decisions have resulted in increasing divergence from Orthodoxy. Key differences include:  Homosexuality  Conservative Judaism has long discussed the issue of homosexuality, and whether or not a re-evaluation of the subject is appropriate. The issue had been informally discussed since the 1980s, and became a formal issue studied by the CJLS in the early 1990s. The CJLS consistently refused to pass several proposed takkanot concerning the Levitical prohibitions on male-male anal sex as well as other forms of homosexual intimacy. In 1993, the Committee adopted a consensus position reaffirming a blanket prohibition on homosexual conduct while welcoming homosexuals as members. Arguments over homosexuality were framed as formal halakhic responsa, one of the most prominent by rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson. He argued that homosexuality, as it is now understood today, was not described by the Torah nor understood by traditional rabbis. As such, one would be able to restrict the understanding of the Torah prohibition to cases not being considered today. His views were not accepted. Later, rabbi Elliot N. Dorff used similar arguments in his case for re-evaluating homosexuality. Dorff studied the issue of coercion, arguing that people who were innately homosexual due to biology were not to be regarded as sinning. His early papers on the subject began to gain acceptance among a minority of RA rabbis, but ultimately it was made clear that the CJLS would not accept this argument as sufficient. Two additional papers, one by rabbi Gordon Tucker and one by rabbis Myron Geller, Robert Fine, and David Fine, went further than Dorff's paper. Tucker's paper stated that it is necessary to expand the definition of the halakhic process, and the Geller, Fine, and Fine paper redefined the corpus of halakha as the representing the evolving beliefs and ideals of the Jewish people of a particular time and place as distinct from representing an infallible Divine will. While both papers had the support of at least 6 members, a majority of the CJLS found that both papers represented so extensive a change that they could not be accepted as a mere changes of Jewish law, but each should be regarded as a takkanah that would uproot a Torah prohibition if passed. Under the CJLS rules, once a majority of the committee found a responsum to be a takkanah, accepting it would require a majority of the Committee (13 of 25 votes), while an ordinary responsum could be accepted as a valid alternative with as few as 6 of 25 votes. On December 6, 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted opposing responsa on the issue of homosexuality. The CJLS's action permits each congregational rabbi and rabbinical school to decide which responsum to adopt and hence set its own policy on the subject. The adoption of dual responsa represents a straddling of the contemporary societal divide over sexual matters. In June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13–0 vote.Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines Shabbat In the 1950s and 1960s the Conservative movement permitted limited circumstances regarding driving to a synagogue on Shabbat. * The CJLS accepted a responsum which holds that if a person rides to synagogue on Shabbat, with the intention of fulfilling Shabbat mitzvot, and that if no other driving on Shabbat is done, then that person will not be held as being in violation of halakha. The decision about driving was in the nature of an emergency decree, overriding what the authors saw as rabbinic law. The reason was that a tremendous number of American Jews were now living far from synagogues as an unavoidable consequence of modern life, and unless Jews were permitted to drive to synagogue, then most American Jews would lose their connection to Jewish life (\\"Responsum on the Sabbath\\"Responsum on the Sabbath Retrieved September 5, 2012. by rabbis Morris Adler, Jacob B. Agus and Theodore Friedman.) :This teshuvah became somewhat infamous within the observant Conservative Jewish community, and the CJLS was forced to issue a clarification some years later, as the laity came to believe that driving on Shabbat was now generally permitted. (It was not so permitted.) A clarification of these teshuvot was issued in \\"Travel on the Sabbath\\", a statement unanimously adopted by the CJLS on 2/17/60. :A vigorous debate on the controversy that these responsa sparked, and how they should be viewed today, arose in the late 1990s and continues today. Modern Conservative views may be found in \\"Reflections on the Driving Teshuvah\\" by Avram Hein in the Spring 2004 issue of \\"Conservative Judaism, along with responses by rabbis David Fine, Susskind Goldberg, Kassel Abelson, and Ismar Schorsch), Conservative Judaism Vol. 56(3), pp. 21–50. * The CJLS allowed some use of electricity on Shabbat, so long as the use of this electricity did not violate any melakha, Shabbat-prohibited activity. This decision was based on an argument that the nature of electricity more resembled running water in a faucet, which can be turned on and off on Shabbat, than fire, which cannot be ignited on Shabbat. (\\"Responsum on the Sabbath\\" by rabbis Morris Adler, Jacob B. Agus and Theodore Friedman.) * In 1989 the Conservative movement allowed rabbis to permit videotaping bar and bat mitzvahs on Shabbat, on grounds that a videotape is not a form of writing (which is prohibited on Shabbat). This permission operates under the restriction that such videotaping is set up before Shabbat, and that no Jew operates said equipment during Shabbat. *The Masorti movements in both Israel and the United Kingdom have rejected the Driving Teshuvah and maintain a general prohibition on driving on Shabbat. The role of women * Early in its history, Conservative Judaism determined that a mechitza separating men and women was not required in services, and that women could be called to the Torah if permitted by the synagogue rabbi. Both decisions were based on arguments from Jewish sources. * The CJLS passed a takkanah which allowed Jewish women to count in the prayer minyan. Throughout 1973 the CJLS debated various responsa on this subject. In August 1973 a vote was taken. Instead of voting for or against a particular responsum, the committee voted on accepting the conclusions of the teshuvot. A motion was passed which stated that \\"Men and women should be counted equally for a minyan.\\", with nine in favor and four opposed. According to rabbi David Fine (Women and Minyan, 2002, p. 3) this was because those voting disagreed about the reasoning; no one teshuvah's reasoning was totally satisfactory to all members. Some rabbis agreed with the reasoning, but thought that the change was inadvisable because of possible negative effects on the structure of the Jewish family, or the strength of the Conservative movement. (ibid, p. 3) :Rabbi Philip Sigal and his supporters held that Jewish law did not actually prevent women from being counted in a minyan. (Fine, p.4) Sigal holds that the Mishneh Torah and Shulkhan Arukh do not state that ten males must make up a minyan; rather these sources only say that ten are required. His views were later disputed by some other Conservative rabbis, most prominently David Feldman. (Woman's Role and Jewish Law in Siegel, ed., Conservative Judaism and Jewish Law, p. 300.) Around this same time, rabbi Sigal later reported that many CJLS rabbis did not agree with the reasoning in his paper, even if they happened to agree with his conclusion. He concluded that counting women in a minyan was justifiable within the halakhic system, but could no longer be viewed as a change in minhag; it was a change in halakha as established by precedent, and thus and should be viewed as a takkanah. (Fine, p.4) This is also the view accepted in Fine's 2002 CJLS paper. * In 1983 a number of Conservative rabbis issued responsa on the same subject, arguing that women can and should be counted in the prayer minyan. These papers were written as part of the process of JTS deciding on whether or not to admit women to its rabbinic and cantorial programs. However, the Chancellor of JTS at the time took this process out of the hands of the CJLS, and made the process an affair of the JTS faculty, a move that caused strong controversy, and several resignations of Talmud faculty from JTS. The decision to allow women to become rabbinical and cantorial candidates was then based on a vote of JTS faculty, in principle based on their readings of these responsa and their own understanding of the relevant texts. :The anger generated by this controversy affects JTS to this day. The sensitivity over this issue caused future JTS Chancellors Ismar Schorsch, and then Arnold Eisen to avoid making future halakhic decisions, and insisting that such issues be resolved by the CJLS, e.g. the issue of homosexuality. This was especially apparent as Schorsch was a strong proponent of not changing the movement's views on homosexuality, while Eisen was a proponent of making such changes. Despite their personal views, each felt it would be improper to overrule the CJLS. * In 2002, long after the Conservative movement had adopted complete de facto egalitarianism, it offered its first responsum on the subject, the Fine responsum, holding that Jewish women as a corporate entity could agree to assume the same obligations as men and be bound by them corporately, without any individual woman having to do so personally. The CJLS effectively passed a takkanah ruling that women may be counted as witnesses in all areas of Jewish law. This change is viewed as a lifting of a rabbinical prohibition that were rooted in social dynamics. See Myron S. Geller, \\"Woman is Eligible to Testify\\"; Susan Grossman, \\"Edut Nashim k'Edut Anashim: The Testimony of Women is as the Testimony of Men\\" and Joseph H. Prouser, \\"On Women Serving as Witnesses–A Dissent\\". Kashrut – keeping kosher The Conservative movement's understanding of kashrut is generally the same as that within Orthodox Judaism. However, on issues where leniency is possible its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards consistently allows the lenient views as an acceptable option. For instance, it is permissible to view all gelatin as kosher, milk does not have to be cholov yisrael, and red meat does not have to be glatt. The one significant difference between Orthodox and conservative interpretations of halakha is that in the 1960s the CJLS accepted a responsum which stated that American wines, being manufactured automatically rather than \\"by gentiles\\", might be viewed as kosher. A 1985 responsum by rabbi Elliot Dorff overturned that ruling. Kohanim Conservative Judaism affirms the belief in a rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem, in which Kohanim may bring offerings. However, Conservative Jews generally reject the idea that animal sacrifices will be a part of these services. The movement has no official position on what will or should occur in a future Temple.  Restrictions on marriage  In 1968 rabbi Isaac Klein wrote a responsum accepted by the CJLS that allowed a Kohen to marry a convert if the Kohen, after counseling on the religious issues involved, agreed to stop performing priestly functions and understood that offspring of the marriage would not be regarded as Kohanim. (Responsa and Halakhic Studies, Ktav.) The reasoning behind this responsum was that: *Since the Temple in Jerusalem no longer extant, kohanim are no longer needed to perform Temple services in a state of ritual purity. *The priestly status of most modern-day kohanim is doubtful at best. The frequent persecutions and expulsions of Jews throughout history have caused kohanim to lose track of their genealogy. *Because the intermarriage crisis among American Jewry is an extreme situation, the Conservative movement feels it must support the decision of two Jews to marry. The responsum puts this forth as an emergency situation. Any marriage between two Jews should be encouraged. As the rate of intermarriage among American Jews increased, the issue was revisited again in the 1990s. In 1996 the CJLS issued two emergency takkanot effectively lifting biblical restrictions on Kohen marriages. This was done given the high rate of intermarriage in the USA, and the need to keep two Jews who marry within the Jewish community. Rabbi Goodman details the Talmud's ruling that rabbis have the right to uproot Biblical prohibitions in three cases, and examples of how this was done in practice (Solemnizing the Marriage Between a Kohen and a Divorcee) p. 2 (bottom) p. 3 (top) :Goodman offers sources which admit that \\"Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... Later authorities thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate and necessary to uproot..\\" but then gives sources that state \\"Yet the right to uproot. was never completely prohibited. There was often the need for an escape hatch, and the right of Rabbinic authorities to do so was articulated by the Rashba...\\" (p.3) :Goodman's paper argues that the high rate of intermarriage and need to keep married Jews in the Jewish community meets traditional rabbinic standards for such actions, and notes \\"Should the current rate of intermarriage be reversed, a future Law Committee may well decide to review this issue. At this time, however, we face a crisis of such proportion that we dare not, in good conscience, stand between the marriage of two Jews whose union as forbidden by virtue of his being a Kohen and she a divorcee. Our steadfast refusal to solemnize their marriage, or even to agree to do this only after seeking to dissuade them, may well lead the couple to be married either in a civil ceremony or in a ceremony without full chuppah and kiddushin. ...\\" (p.4) ::Arnold M. Goodman, \\"Solemnizing the Marriage Between a Kohen and a Divorcee\\" EH 6:1.1996 ::Arnold M. Goodman, \\"Solemnizing the Marriage Between a Kohen and a Convert\\" EH 6:8.1996 Unlike the Klein responsum, which like the Orthodox view regarded kohanim in and offspring of prohibited marriages as disqualified from performing priestly functions or receiving priestly honors and benefits, the Takkanah held that they are to be regarded as Kohanim in good standing. Giving Kohanim precedence in reading from the Torah The CJLS accepted a responsum concluding that synagogues are not required to call a Kohen to the first aliyah (reading) at a Torah reading, although traditionalist synagogues may choose to continue to do so out of custom.  Priestly functions  The CJLS has also determined that a Bat-Kohen (daughter of a Kohen) can perform priestly functions including the Pidyon HaBen ceremony and the Priestly Blessing. Mamzerut The CJLS issued a ruling, which, while not abolishing the Torah category of mamzerut (children born of an incestuous or adulterous union), effectively ended the category's application to Conservative Judaism. The CJLS accepted a responsum which instructs Conservative rabbis to refuse to accept evidence on this subject, thus preventing anyone from being declared a mamzer by a Conservative rabbi. The responsum explained that its approach was based on \\"morality... of our tradition\\": :We cannot conceive of God sanctioning undeserved suffering… When a law of Torah conflicts with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', we are committed to find a way to address the problem… We are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes when needed on moral grounds. It is our desire to strengthen Torah that forces us to recognize, explicitly the overriding importance of morality, a morality which we learn from the larger, unfolding narrative of our traditionRabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz, Mamzerut, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, EH 4.200a, pp. 558–586 :Rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz, an esteemed halakhic authority, created a responsum effectively making the Biblical category of mamzerut (bastardy) inoperative, he writes how the \\"morality which we learn through the unfolding narrative of our tradition\\" can override traditional understandings of Jewish law. Orthodox Jewish approaches had recognized the difficulty of maintaining such a category under circumstances where it has become common to divorce civilly and remarry without obtaining a Jewish get (bill of divorce). Orthodoxy thus devised strict rules of evidence rendering it all but impossible to prove the existence of such cases, but had kept the category as a theoretical possibility and enforced it in a very small number of controversial modern cases. In declaring its willingness to \\"do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past\\" and get rid of the applicability of the category entirely, the CJLS expressly declared that it did not consider classical rabbinic understanding of this subject to be \\"the final word\\" regarding the Divine will, and that \\"Aggadah\\", its evolving conception of morality, can and should override Biblical injunctions when the two come into conflict: :While Conservative Judaism would affirm that the Torah is Divine in its origin, the revelation at Sinai is seen as the beginning of a relationship and not the final word. Interpretation is understood as our communal attempt to understand the will of a compassionate Divine partner. As we mature we are able to understand God's will for us more clearly. If a law appears unconscionable, we would say that the shortcoming is either our previous understanding or that circumstances have so changed that the rule no longer meets its intended result...The Conservative movement maintains that the purpose of the law in the first place is largely to concretize moral values, and so the specific form of the law can and should be changed if it is not effectively doing that. In other words, the Aggadah should control the halakha.ibid., at p. 575 :When a law of Torah conflicts with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', we are committed to finding a way to address the problem. As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old. At the same time, we are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.ibid., at p. 585  Niddah, family purity and family holiness  On December 6, 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted three responsa on the subject of Niddah.\\".Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 Two responsa were the majority opinions, one by rabbi Susan GrossmanRabbi Susan Grossman, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Being Created Human, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 and one by rabbi Avram Reisner,Rabbi Avram Reisner, Observing Niddah in Our Day: An Inquiry on the Status of Purity and the Prohibition of Sexual Activity with a Menstruant, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 the other responsum was the minority opinion, written by rabbi Miriam Berkowitz.Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Reshaping the Laws of Family Purity for the Modern World, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 All three responsa held that Conservative Judaism requires women and their sexual partners to abstain from sexual relations for a period of time during and following the woman's menstrual period, and regards this requirement as a Biblical commandment. Two of the three responsa, however, adapted positions more permissive on certain details than required in Orthodox Judaism. These details included: *Contact between spouses during Niddah. The Grossman and Berkowitz responsa dropped a rabbinic prohibition requiring spouses to completely refrain from touching each other during niddah and permitted nonsexual contact. The Reisner responsum maintained the prohibition on physical contact. *The duration of the Niddah period. The Grossman and Reisner responsa permitted counting 7 days from the start of menstruation rather than the end. The Berkowitz's responsum required counting 7 days from the end of menstruation but dropped a minimum menstrual period requirement. *The basis for Niddah. The Grossman and Berkowitz responsum held that the concepts of ritual purity and ritual impurity do not apply in the absence of a Temple in Jerusalem and hence are inapplicable to the contemporary context. They suggested that Conservative Judaism develop a new theological foundation for the practice and suggested renaming it \\"family holiness\\" rather than \\"family purity\\" to reflect its modern understanding as founded on concepts of holiness rather than \\"purity\\". The Reisner responsum maintained that the Biblical concepts of ritual purity and ritual impurity continue to apply in contemporary times and are binding on Conservative Judaism. Debate over halakhic foundations There has recently been debate within Conservative Judaism as to whether and to what extent the movement should continue to base, or claim to base, its practices on halakha. In the keynote address to the December 2005 Biennial convention, JTS philosophy professor Neil Gillman urged Conservative Judaism to \\"abandon its claim that we are a halakhic movement\\", which he called \\"irrelevant to the vast majority of our lay people\\". This speech was strongly criticised. Rabbi David Golinkin, head of the Schechter Institute in Jerusalem, for example, commented that \\"If the Conservative movement abandons its claim that it is a halakhic movement, it really has no reason to exist.\\" Differences from Orthodox theology Both Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism view rabbinic decrees and interpretations as open to some re-evaluation. However, whereas according to the Thirteen Principles of Faith of Orthodox Judaism the halakha contains a core reflecting a direct Divine revelation that represents God's final and unalterable word to the Jewish people on these matters, Conservative Judaism does not necessarily consider portions of the halakha, and even Biblical law, as a direct record of Divine revelation. The CJLS has written that the Torah represents merely \\"the beginning of a relationship\\" rather than a final word and can be superseded by new understanding and new circumstances \\"as we mature\\".Spitz, p. 575 This more liberal approach to revelation has that Conservative Judaism's rabbinate can overrule Biblical as well as rabbinic law believed to be inconsistent with modern requirements. The CJLS has issued a number of rabbinic decrees, or takhanot (plural of takhanah), that lift biblically-derived prohibitions – prohibitions which Orthodox Judaism universally regards as sacrosanct. Examples of such Conservative decrees are: * a 1961 decree permitting driving to synagogue on Shabbat, overriding the Biblical injunction on the use of fire on Shabbat (based on the rejection of the view that driving equates with making fire.)

He also performed in the Acapulco Festival (Mexico), in Miami, and Sweden. In 1997 Laacré quit the project, citing artistic and economic differences. He was replaced by the Argentine vocalist of British descent Alan Duffy. From then on the band switched headquarters to Spain, where they achieved greater success because of Alan Duffy's intense tenor vocal range. The next release was the album Animal another big success throughout Latin America. In 1998 King África started a new Latin American tour, also traveling to Europe, most notably in Spain.

From 1328 to 1336, he was the diocesan administrator of the archdiocese of Mainz and from 1331 to 1337 (with interruptions) of those of Worms and Speyer. He was one of the most important German prelates of his age. Born in Luxembourg to the count Henry VI, he was intended for an ecclesiastic career at an early age. He studied theology and canon law at the University of Paris, for his family was on good terms with the Capetian court of France. He was only twenty-two years of age when elected Archbishop of Trier in 1307. In 1308, he was consecrated bishop by Pope Clement V in Poitiers. He quickly became one of the most influential princes in Germany, influencing the election that year of his brother Henry VII as King and Holy Roman Emperor. From 1310 to 1313, Baldwin accompanied Henry in Italy, where he was crowned emperor in Rome on 29 June 1312. In the election which followed Henry's early death the next year, Baldwin lent his support to Louis the Bavarian. He later repudiated the Bavarian, however, and moved to support his great-nephew Charles IV in 1346. He was Charles's greatest supporter in the west of the realm. From 1324 to 1326, he was one of the four lords in the Four Lords' War against Metz. In 1328, he was lured into Starkenburg castle on the Moselle by Loretta of Sponheim. He was only released after a ransom was paid and concessions made. Likewise in that year, he was put forward by his own cathedral chapter as a candidate for the vacant Mainz archdiocese, but the Pope appointed Henry III of Virneburg. Baldwin did govern the archbishopric until the so-called \\"Mainz Schism\\" was terminated by the Avignon curia in 1336. During that time period, from 1331 to 1337, Baldwin had as well endeavoured to control the dioceses of Worms and Speyer. The Balduinbrücke in Koblenz. Baldwin, like most medieval bishops, was a patron of his see. He built the Balduinbrücke (Baldwin's Bridge) in Koblenz and repaired the old Roman bridge in Trier. He reformed the administration of the archdiocese and preserved official documents. He had many copies made and four manuscript copies of the archives of the diocese survive in the main national archives in Koblenz. Baldwin also strove to connect the various regions of his diocese (Trier and Koblenz). He did not shy away from military methods. He died in a monastic cell in the local Charterhouse and was buried in the west choir of Trier Cathedral.

The asteroid was discovered on 11 October 1925, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. It was named after female paratrooper Ljuba Berlin, who died at an early age. The C-type asteroid has a longer-than average rotation period of 33.8 hours.  Orbit and classification  Ljuba is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,902 days; semi- major axis of 3 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory in October 1904. The body's observation arc also begins at Heidelberg in February 1929, or 16 months after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Ljuba is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid.  Rotation period  In October 2003, a rotational lightcurve of Ljuba was obtained from photometric observations by American amateur astronomer Walter Cooney at this Blackberry Observatory in Port Allen, Louisiana. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 33.8 hours with a brightness variation of 0.17 magnitude (). Lower-rated lightcurves by Richard Binzel, René Roy and Laurent Bernasconi gave a somewhat longer period of 36, 41.5 and 42 hours, respectively (). While not being a slow rotator, Ljuba period is significantly longer than that for most other asteroids, which rotate every 2–20 hours once around their axis.  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Ljuba measures between 51.017 and 60.80 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.060 and 0.12. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0668 and a diameter of 55.10 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.85.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Soviet parachutist Ljuba Berlin (1915–1936). The asteroids and were also named after Soviet female paratroopers, namely, Tamara Ivanova (1912–1936) and Nata Babushkina (1915–1936), respectively.

Life Espejo was born about 1540 in Cordova, Spain, and arrived in Mexico in 1571 along with the Chief Inquisitor, Pedro Moya de Contreras, who was sent by the Spanish king to establish an Inquisition. Espejo and his brother became ranchers on the northern frontier of Mexico. In 1581, Espejo and his brother were charged with murder. His brother was imprisoned and Espejo fled to Santa Barbara, Chihuahua, the northernmost outpost of Mexico. He was there when the Chamuscado-Rodriguez expedition returned from New Mexico.Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580-1594. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1966, 16–17 En route to New Mexico Espejo, a wealthy man, assembled and financed an expedition for the ostensible purpose of ascertaining the fate of two priests who had remained behind with the Pueblos when Chamuscado led his soldiers back to Mexico. Along with fourteen soldiers, a priest, about 30 Indian servants and assistants, and 115 horses he departed from San Bartolome, near Santa Barbara, on November 10, 1582.Bolton, Herbert E. Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542-1706. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 163–164; Riley, Carroll. Rio del Norte. Salt Lake City: U of Utah Press, 1995 Frederic Remington's imaginative painting of a Spanish expedition on the march Espejo followed the same route as Chamuscado and Rodriguez, down the Conchos River to its junction (La Junta) with the Rio Grande and then up the Rio Grande to the Pueblo villages. Along the Conchos River, Espejo encountered the Conchos Indians \\"naked people ... who support themselves on fish, mesquite, mescal, and lechuguilla (agave)\\". Further downriver, he found Conchos who grew corn, squash, and melons. Leaving the Conchos behind, Espejo next encountered the Passaguates \\"who were naked like the Conchos\\" and seemed to have had a similar lifestyle. Next, came the Jobosos who were few in number, shy, and ran away from the Spaniards. All of these tribes had previously been impacted by Spanish slave raids.\\"Hammond and Rey, 155–160, 215–216 Near the junction (La Junta) of the Conchos and the Rio Grande, Espejo entered the territory of the Patarabueyes who attacked his horses, killing three. Espejo succeeded in making peace with them. The Patarabueyes, he said, and the other Indians near La Junta were also called \\"Jumanos\\". -- the first use of the name for these Indians who would be prominent on the frontier for nearly two centuries. To add to the confusion, they were also called Otomoacos and Abriaches. Espejo saw five settlements of Jumanos with a population of about 10,000 people. They lived in low, flat- roofed houses and grew corn, squash, and beans and hunted and fished along the river. They gave Espejo well-tanned deer and bison skins. Leaving the Jumano behind, he passed through the lands of the Caguates or Suma, who spoke the same language as the Jumanos, and the Tanpachoas or Mansos. He found the Rio Grande Valley well populated all the way up to the present site of El Paso, Texas. Upstream from El Paso, the expedition traveled 15 days without seeing any people.Hammond and Rey, 169, 216–220 The Pueblos Taos Pueblo today still resembles the towns Espejo visited in the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. In February 1583, Espejo arrived at the territory of the Piros, the most southerly of the Pueblo villagers. From there the Spanish continued up the Rio Grande. Espejo described the Pueblo villages as \\"clean and tidy\\". The houses were multi-storied and made of adobe bricks. \\"They make very fine tortillas,\\" Espejo commented, and the Pueblos also served the Spanish turkeys, beans, corns, and pumpkins. The people \\"did not seem to be bellicose\\". The southernmost Pueblos had only clubs for weapons plus a few \\"poor Turkish bows and poorer arrows\\". Further north, the Indians were better armed and more aggressive. Some of the Pueblo towns were large, Espejo described Zia as having 1,000 houses and 4,000 men and boys. In their farming, the Pueblos used irrigation \\"with canals and dams, built as if by Spaniards\\". The only Spanish influence that Espejo noted among the Pueblos was their desire for iron. They would steal any iron article they could find.Hammond and Rey, 172–182 Espejo explored the Verde River valley of Arizona looking for silver mines. Espejo confirmed that the two priests had been killed by the Indians in the pueblo of Puala, near present-day Bernalillo. As the Spanish approached the Pueblo the inhabitants fled to the nearby mountains. The Spanish continued their explorations, east and west of the Rio Grande apparently with no opposition from the Indians. Near Acoma, they noted that a people called Querechos lived in the mountains nearby and traded with the townspeople. These Querechos were Navajo. The closely related Apache of the Great Plains during this period were also called Querechos. Espejo also visited the Zuni and Hopi and heard stories of silver mines further west. With four men and Hopi guides he went in search of the mines, reaching the Verde River in Arizona, probably in the area of Montezuma Castle National Monument. He found the mines near present-day Jerome, Arizona, but was unimpressed by their potential. He heard from the local Indians, probably Yavapai, of a large river to the west, undoubtedly a reference to the Colorado.Flint, Richard and Shirley Cushing, \\"Espejo Expedition\\" New Mexico Office of the State Historian http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=467 , accessed 4 Nov 2012 Among the Hopi and the Zuni, Espejo met several Spanish-speaking Mexican Indians who had been left behind by, or escaped from, the Coronado expedition more than 40 years earlier. The priest, several of the soldiers, and the Indian assistants decided, despite Espejo's entreaties, to return to Mexico.Flint, Richard and Flint, Shirley Cushing \\"Espejo Expedition,\\" New Mexico Office of State Historian. http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=467 , accessed, Apr 1, 2010 It is possible that the priest was offended by the high-handed tactics of Espejo in dealing with the Pueblos. Espejo and eight soldiers stayed behind to look for silver and other precious metals. The little force had a skirmish with the Indians of Acoma Pueblo, apparently because two women slaves or prisoners of the Spanish escaped. The Spanish recaptured the women briefly, but they had to fight their way free. A Spanish soldier was wounded. In aiding the escape of the women, the Acomans and the Spanish exchanged volleys of harquebus fire, stones, and arrows. The Spanish, thus, were placed on notice that the hospitality of the Pueblos had limits. The Spanish then returned to the Rio Grande Valley where at a village they executed 16 Indians who mocked them and refused them food.Hammond and Rey, 201–204 The Spanish quickly departed the Rio Grande and explored eastward, journeying through the Galisteo Basin near the future city of Santa Fe and reaching the large pueblo at Pecos, called Ciquique. Return journey Rather than return to the now unfriendly Rio Grande Valley, Espejo decided to return to Mexico via the Pecos River which he called \\"Rio de Las Vacas\\" because of the large number of bison the Spaniards encountered during the first six days they followed the river downstream. After descending the river about 300 miles from Ciquique the soldiers met Jumano Indians near Pecos, Texas, who guided them across country, up Toyah Creek, and cross country to La Junta. From here they followed the Conchos River upstream to San Bartolome, their starting place, arriving September 20, 1583. The priest and his companions had also returned safely.Hammond and Rey, 229 Espejo was the first European to traverse most of the length of the Pecos River. Espejo died in 1585 in Havana, Cuba. He was en route to Spain to attempt to get royal permission to establish a Spanish colony in New Mexico.Handbook of Texas Online, http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fes03, accessed Apr 1, 2010 A chronicle of his expeditions was later published by Spanish historian and explorer Baltasar Obregón.

Newell also programmed Entombed for the 2600 and the Vectrex port of Scramble. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot On each floor of the building, the player must put out the flames and reach the panel that opens the doors to get back out. While doing so, there is a meter at the top showing how many people are on that floor. The longer it takes a player to open the doors and get out, the more the meter decreases. The object is to work as fast as you can while avoiding and putting out flames to open the doors and escape with the most people remaining on the meter. The game can be played by one or two players. Reception Towering Inferno was reviewed in Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"an above-average, enjoyable cartridge [that] is a refreshing change from shoot- shoot-shoot\\". Reviewers emphasized the non-violent nature of the game, noting that it \\"achieves a respectable level of excitement without having a shot fired in anger\\", however they also cautioned readers that the game \\"may be a little too patterned and repetitive for some\\". Videogaming Illustrated described the game as \\"fast-paced entertainment\\" and listed it as \\"highly recommended\\". Later reviewers were less forgiving of the graphics but praised the gameplay. In Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide, Brett Weiss describes the graphics as \\"cheap looking\\" but describes the gameplay as \\"original and even compelling\\".

Joseph Cooke (1775–1811), a Free Christian, was expelled by the Wesleyan Methodists on doctrinal grounds and became the inspiration behind the Methodist Unitarian movement formed under the leadership of another former Wesleyan Joseph Ashworth. Biography Joseph Cooke was born near Dudley in the Black Country. In 1795, Cooke entered the Methodist itinerancy. In 1803 he was appointed to the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Union Street, Rochdale, east Lancashire. During his ministry in the mill town he was rebuked by the Conference and transferred to Sunderland. Whilst in the north-east, his supporters in Rochdale published two of his sermons on justification by faith. Later, during the 1806 Conference, he was expelled from the Wesleyan Methodists for preaching doctrines incompatible with Methodist beliefs. A significant proportion of the Union Street congregation supported their former minister and helped him to establish a brand-new chapel (The Providence Chapel, High Street) in Rochdale. Cooke ministered in the chapel and the surrounding districts until his death in 1811.Davies, Rupert; George, Raymond; & Rupp, Gordon (ed.) (1978) \\" A History of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, volume 2\\" Epworth Press; At the time of Cooke's premature demise there were more than 1,000 'Cookites', organised around 16 'preaching- stations' and served by 18 preachers.Goring, Jeremy & Rosemary (1984) \\" The Unitarians\\" Religious & Moral Education Press; Methodist Unitarians After Cooke’s death, Providence Chapel building in Rochdale was sold to a Congregationalist group. Like many English General Baptists, the Cookites throughout east Lancashire were persuaded by Richard Wright (1765–1836), \`the Unitarian missionary', to make common cause with their liberal Christian counterparts within Unitarianism. In Rochdale, led by James Wilkinson, the Cookites, or ‘Methodist Unitarians’ as they soon became known, erected a new chapel in Clover Street in 1818. The chapel soon became known locally as the ‘Co-op chapel’ “because Wilkinson and at least nine of the original co- operators worshipped there”. (This Methodist Unitarian link to the early labour movement continued. For example, both James Taylor and James Mills, the Rochdale and the Oldham delegates to the first Chartist convention in 1839, were Methodist Unitarians).Chartist Ancestors home page In 1890, the Clover Street Chapel congregation merged with the much older (seventeenth century) Unitarian meeting, Blackwater Street, and remains active today as part of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. Unitarian organizations In 1915, the Unitarian Historical Society was founded. It encourages and supports the study of Unitarian history and that of its constituent and related traditions, including the Methodist Unitarian movement inspired by Joseph Cooke. The Unitarian Christian Association was founded in 1991. One of its aims is to promote Unitarian Christian religion in the congregations of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. This is an aim that Cooke himself would have approved of.

Twice she was a member of the Ziegfeld Follies. Family Oakland's parents were Edward Andersen of Fredrikstad, Norway and Anna Marthine Olsen, also of Norway. Her siblings' names were Edward, Herbert (née Hagbart), and Vivien. Her sister performed on Broadway and in motion pictures as Vivian Oakland. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Anna Andersen, a widow since 1898, moved the family to Oakland, California, where the sisters took their stage names. Stage Edna and Vivien appeared in vaudeville as the Anker sisters (an old family name). They changed their surname to Oakland in tribute to their hometown. They performed as the Oakland Sisters in the Boston Juveniles, a vaudeville group. They traveled the west coast as far as Seattle, Washington. The sisters ended up in New York City, appearing with the Ziegfeld Follies and other shows. In 1915, Oakland began a solo stage career. In November 1924, she had an important role in Heidelberg, the musical version of a play made famous by Richard Mansfield. Film career Beginning in 1930, Oakland performed in Hollywood motion pictures. Her first feature was The Heart Breaker (1930) directed by Edmund Joseph. She was cast with Joan Blondell, Gloria Shea, and Walter Kinsella. She played a reporter in Wedding Present (1936) and a nurse in Hit Parade of 1937. Oakland's film career lasted into the late 1940s with uncredited roles in Tonight and Every Night (1945), Thrill of a Romance (1945), and Riverboat Rhythm (1946). Marriage In 1919, she married Captain Garnette Rotan,Cook County, Illinois, Marriages Index, 1871-1920 who served with distinction in World War I. Their romance began in 1917 when Oakland was playing in a Broadway theater production. The actress became engaged to English actor Thomas Oliver Neville Clark. Clark was deported from America in June 1935 because he overstayed his visitor's permit. Vivian met and married actor John Murry. The couple had a daughter named Joan. They continued their careers in movies and relocated to southern California. The Murry's operated a small bookshop on Ventura Boulevard in the 1940s. Dagmar Oakland died in Burbank, California in 1989.

A modern book illustration of the world map in the Ulm Ptolemy Johannes Schnitzer's world map from Holle's 1482 edition of Ptolemy's Geography. Nicolaus Germanus () was a German cartographer who published an edition of Jacopo d'Angelo's Latin translation of Ptolemy's Geography. He also created two globes depicting earth and sky in 1477, predating Martin Behaim's Erdapfel. Name Nicolaus Germanus is the Latin form of the name \\"Nicholas the German\\". His exact name is unknown, although it is often given with Donis, Donnus, Donmus, or Donus. These are not, however, names but abbreviated forms of the Latin title \\"Lord\\" (Dominus).. Life The exact dates of his birth and death are not known. He is sometimes referred to as a Humanist monk of the Benedictine order possibly from Reichenbach Priory (now in Baden-Württemberg). His manuscript edition of Ptolemy was ready by around 1468, but not published until 1482. Works In 1477, two years after the opening of the Vatican Library, Nicolaus Germanus created a globe each for earth and sky, for which he was paid 200 ducats on 11 December 1477 according to a receipt.:de:Bild:Germanus.jpeg An additional three ducats were paid the next day for the adding of the papal coat of arms, and four more on 20 December for two covers. The globes are listed in an inventory of 1481. The marchesa of Mantua, Isabella, asked for copies in 1505. The globes were kept in Salle Pontifica (Magna Secreta) until they were lost in the 1527 Sack of Rome. The earth globe of Nicolaus Germanus is considered the first modern globe to be documented. Nicolaus Germanus's editions of Ptolemy are notable for including four new inset maps showing new European discoveries and for modifying the world map to reflect Italians' better knowledge of Scandinavia following Claudius Clavus's 1424 visit to Italy. Nicolaus Germanus was also the first Western cartographer to publish Ptolemy's more difficult second projection, in which parallels of latitude are made equidistant but meridians converge toward the poles; it became known in his time as the \\"Donis Projection\\". * . The 1482 edition is notable as the first atlas to be colored by its publisher in-house prior to sale; uncolored examples are unusual. The printing of the world maps in these books was credited to \\"Johann the Block-cutter\\" (Johannes Schnitzer) or \\"Johann from Armsheim\\" ('), distinctive for his use of a reversed capital (i.e., )..

The idea is not accepted by the scientific community, as plants lack nervous systems.Galston, Arthur W; Slayman, Clifford L. Plant Sensitivity and Sensation. In George Ogden Abell, Barry Singer.

Jong, Tom de; Klinkhamer, Peter. (2005). Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Reproductive Strategies. Cambridge University Press. p. 2. \\"Plants do not have a nervous system and certainly do not make conscious decisions about what to do next.\\" Paranormal claims in regard to plant perception are considered to be pseudoscience by the scientific community.Audus, Leslie. (1974). Roots of Absurdity. New Scientist. 17 October. p. 207Galston, Arthur W; Slayman, Clifford L. (1979). The Not-So-Secret Life of Plants: In Which the Historical and Experimental Myths About Emotional Communication Between Animal and Vegetable Are Put to Rest. American Scientist 67 (3): 337-344. The idea is distinct from measured plant perception and chemical communication. Early research The notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions was first recorded in 1848, when Gustav Fechner, an experimental psychologist, suggested that plants are capable of emotions and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, attitude, and affection.Heidelberger, Michael. (2004). Nature From Within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his Psychophysical Worldview. University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 54. Jagadish Chandra Bose began to conduct experiments on plants in the year 1900. Bose invented various devices and instruments to measure electrical responses in plants.V. A Shepard cited in Alexander Volkov. (2012). Plant Electrophysiology: Methods and Cell Electrophysiology. Springer. p. 12. \\"Bose began by applying delicate instrumentation he had invented in his semiconductor research to deliver electrical stimuli and record electrical responses from various plant parts... He discovered that both living animal and plant tissues exhibited a diminution of sensitivity after continuous stimulation, recovery after rest, a 'staircase' or summation of electrical effects following mechanical stimulation, abolition of current flow after applying poisons and reduced sensitivity at low temperature.\\" He stated from his experiments that an electrical spasm occurs during the end of life for a plant.Biswal, Basanti; Krupinska, Karin; Biswal, Udaya C. (2013). Plastid Development in Leaves During Growth and Senescence. Springer. p. 303. According to biologist Patrick Geddes \\"In his investigations on response in general Bose had found that even ordinary plants and their different organs were sensitive— exhibiting, under mechanical or other stimuli, an electric response, indicative of excitation.\\"Geddes, Patrick. (1920). The Life and Work of Sir Jagadis C. Bose. Longmans, Green & Company. p. 120 One visitor to his laboratory, the vegetarian playwright George Bernard Shaw, was intensely disturbed upon witnessing a demonstration in which a cabbage had \\"convulsions\\" as it boiled to death. Geddes, Patrick. (1920). The Life and Work of Sir Jagadis C. Bose. Longmans, Green & Company. p. 146 Later research In the 1960s Cleve Backster, an interrogation specialist with the CIA, conducted research that led him to believe that plants can communicate with other lifeforms. Backster's interest in the subject began in February 1966 when he tried to measure the rate at which water rises from a philodendron's root into its leaves. Because a polygraph or 'lie detector' can measure electrical resistance, which would alter when the plant was watered, he attached a polygraph to one of the plant's leaves. Backster stated that, to his immense surprise, \\"the tracing began to show a pattern typical of the response you get when you subject a human to emotional stimulation of short duration\\".Backster, Cleve. (2003). Primary Perception: Biocommunication with Plants, Living Foods, and Human Cells. White Rose Millennium Press. In 1975, K. A. Horowitz, D. C. Lewis and E. L. Gasteiger published an article in Science giving their results when repeating one of Backster's effects - plant response to the killing of brine shrimp in boiling water. The researchers grounded the plants to reduce electrical interference and rinsed them to remove dust particles. As a control three of five pipettes contained brine shrimp while the remaining two only had water: the pipettes were delivered to the boiling water at random. This investigation used a total of 60 brine shrimp deliveries to boiling water while Backster's had used 13. Positive correlations did not occur at a rate great enough to be considered statistically significant.Horowitz, K. A., Lewis, D. C, and Gasteiger, E. L. (1975). Plant Primary Perception: Electrophysiological Unresponsiveness to Brine Shrimp Killing. Science 189: 478-480. Other controlled experiments that attempted to replicate Backster's findings have also produced negative results.Schwebs, Ursula. (1973). Do Plants Have Feelings? Harpers. pp. 75-76Chedd, Graham. (1975). AAAS takes on Emotional Plants. New Scientist. 13 February. pp. 400-401Neher, Andrew. (2011). Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination. Dover Publications. pp. 155-156. Botanist Arthur Galston and physiologist Clifford L. Slayman who investigated Backster's claims wrote: > There is no objective scientific evidence for the existence of such complex > behaviour in plants. The recent spate of popular literature on \\"plant > consciousness\\" appears to have been triggered by \\"experiments\\" with a lie > detector, subsequently reported and embellished in a book called The Secret > Life of Plants. Unfortunately, when scientists in the discipline of plant > physiology attempted to repeat the experiments, using either identical or > improved equipment, the results were uniformly negative. Further > investigation has shown that the original observations probably arose from > defective measuring procedures. John M. Kmetz noted that Backster had not used proper controls in his experiments. When controls were used, no plant reactions to thoughts or threats were observed.Kmetz, John M. (1978). Plant Primary Perception: The Other Side of the Leaf. Skeptical Inquirer 2 (2): 57-61. The television show MythBusters also performed experiments (Season 4, Episode 18, 2006) to verify or disprove the concept. The tests involved connecting plants to a polygraph galvanometer and employing actual and imagined harm upon the plants or upon others in the plants' vicinity. The galvanometer showed a reaction about one third of the time. The experimenters, who were in the room with the plant, posited that the vibrations of their actions or the room itself could have affected the polygraph. After isolating the plant, the polygraph showed a response slightly less than one third of the time. Later experiments with an EEG failed to detect anything. The show concluded that the results were not repeatable, and that the theory was not true.

The village is famous as the site of Thomas Telford's Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. The village's choir became notable when the Universal Music Group album Voices of the Valley was released in November 2006, reaching number 9 on the UK album chart. It became the fastest-selling classical record of all time, achieving gold status in three days and, by 2009, had sold over half a million copies.Fron Male Voice Choir (Voices Of The Valley) at lemonrock.com, 2009 A second album, Voices of the Valley - Encore, was released in November 2007.Quinn, Michael. Fron Male Voice Choir Voices Of The Valley Encore. BBC Music, November or December 2007. Accessed 5 March 2015 History Origins In 1946 the neighbouring town of Llangollen invited the village's participation in a traditional Welsh eisteddfod. Invitations went out for 1947 and the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod was born. Mr Gomer Powell called a public meeting which resulted in the formation of the Froncysyllte Male Voice Choir, with J. R. Jones (\\"Joe Jordan\\") as the first chairman. A local piano teacher, Mr Lloyd Edwards, was appointed as conductor and became the driving force behind the choir. Menna Hughes, daughter of Robert Hughes, the foundation treasurer, and one of Lloyd's pupils, was the inaugural accompanist. To compete in the Male Voice segment of the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod, 60 voices were needed, so Wilfred Jones, leader of the Froncysyllte Youth Club, persuaded the young men of the village to join what was, in 1947, the youngest membership of any Welsh male voice choir. The choristers stayed together after the Eisteddfod, with county councillor Watkin Williams as chairman. Lloyd Edwards went on to win major choral competitions and a reputation for excellence at home and abroad until his death in 1970.Choir History at official site. Accessed 21 June 2015 Association with Pavarotti The choir has remained closely associated with the Eisteddfod and is a regular competitor in the Male Voice Choir competition. In 1955 the choir hosted the Società Corale Gioachino Rossini from Modena, which won first prize at the Llangollen Eisteddfod under the baton of Fernando Pavarotti. This win inspired the conductor's son, Luciano Pavarotti, who sang in the choir, to take up a singing career. The Modena Choir was again hosted by the Froncysyllte Male Voice Choir during its visit, with Luciano Pavarotti, in 1995.Pavarotti eisteddfod career start. BBC News, 6 September 2007.

It served the town of Kirkby Stephen in England and was a junction station for the Eden Valley Railway. The station opened to passenger traffic on 8 August 1861 and closed on 22 January 1962. The station re-opened to traffic as the base of the Stainmore Railway Company in August 2011. The new layout of the station consists of two platforms, one of which is partly covered by the remaining train shed roof, and a bay platform between them, situated in the opposite direction to the original station layout. History Despite its rural location, this was a busy station in its heyday. Starting in 1932, the two expresses to Blackpool - one from Newcastle and the other from Darlington - both stopped at KSE for about five minutes, before setting off towards Blackpool. The return trip also passed through later in the day. Also, the station paid service to the Durham Miners special between 1932 - 1936.  Closure  Kirkby Stephen East railway station in 1997, looking west from the A685 bridge The station closed to passengers in 1962, and was eventually repurposed as a bobbin mill. The bobbin factory subsequently closed in 1992, after the company had fallen into receivership. On the other side of the road bridge, the remaining yard space and goods shed was converted into a caravan park and campsite. The goods shed is still standing to this day. Restoration In 1996, a company called Stainmore Properties Ltd. was formed, with the intention to convert KSE into a heritage centre representing the early 1950s. Stainmore Properties Ltd. purchased the derelict remains of the station and 6.5 acres of surrounding land. In the year 2000, another company, Stainmore Railway Company, was formed to help with the restoration of the site. Since then, essential repairs have been made to the roof and station, a number of rooms have been restored and a short section of track has been laid along the formation of the old Eden Valley Line, with some sidings and yard infrastructure within the station area and surroundings. Heritage platform layout, looking west from station building August 2011 marked the 150th anniversary of the railway. To commemorate this occasion a series of events were held during 2011, leading up to 'Stainmore 150', a large gala, where Steve Davis, the then-head of the National Railway Museum, drove the first fare-paying passenger train from the station in over 50 years, hauled by ex. Kirkby Stephen locomotive BR Standard Class 2 2-6-0 no. 78019. In 2013 the Stainmore Railway Company began its first operating season, running Peckett and Sons 0-4-0 'F C Tingey' on selected weekends. In 2014 this was joined by Yorkshire Engine Company 'Stanton 50' which operates diesel hauled trains on some weekends when there is no steam service. In June 2017 it was announced that a joint Heritage Lottery Fund bid between the Stainmore Railway Company and the Locomotive Conservation and Learning Trust, to restore both LNER J21 65033 and an ex. North Eastern Railway stores van, no. 5523, as an interpretation vehicle to travel with the locomotive, had been successful. As part of the joint bid, it was agreed that, once restoration is completed, the locomotive will be based at Kirkby Stephen East and become the project's flagship locomotive. As a result of this, work is currently underway to create a vastly more flexible track layout within the station yard, as well as building a new restoration shed and authentic locomotive watering facilities. Part of the new work means that a short stretch of the former South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway formation across Bridge 149 has been re-instated.

Bertozzi is known for founding a new field of chemistry: bioorthogonal chemistry. At Stanford University, she holds the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professorship in the School of Humanities and Sciences. Bertozzi is also an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and is the former Director of the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience research center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She received the MacArthur \\"genius\\" award at age 33. In 2010, she was the first woman to receive the prestigious Lemelson-MIT Prize faculty award. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (2005), the Institute of Medicine (2011), and the National Academy of Inventors (2013). In 2014, it was announced that Bertozzi would lead ACS Central Science, the American Chemical Society's first peer-reviewed open access journal that offers all content free to the public. Education and career Carolyn Bertozzi received her B.A. summa cum laude in chemistry from Harvard University, where she worked with Professor Joe Grabowski on the design and construction of a photoacoustic calorimeter. While an undergraduate, she played in various bands, including one with future Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello. After graduating, she worked at Bell Labs with Chris Chidsey. Bertozzi completed her Ph.D. in Chemistry at UC Berkeley in 1993 with Professor Mark Bednarski, working on the chemical synthesis of oligosaccharide analogs. While working under Professor Bednarski, she discovered that viruses can bind to sugars in the body. The discovery led her to her current field of research glycobiology. After completing a Ph.D., Bertozzi was a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF with Professor Steven Rosen, where she studied the activity of endothelial oligosaccharides in promoting cell adhesion at inflammation sites. While working with Professor Rosen, Bertozzi was able to modify the protein and sugar molecules in the walls of living cells so that the cells accept foreign materials such as implants. Bertozzi joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1996. She has been an investigator with HHMI since 2000. In 1999, while working with HHMI and at UC Berkeley, she founded the field of bioorthogonal chemistry and coined the term in 2003. This new field and technique allows researchers to chemically modify molecules in living organisms and not interrupt the processes of the cell. In 2015, Bertozzi moved to Stanford University to join the ChEM-H Institute. Bertozzi studies the glycobiology of underlying diseases such as cancer, inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. In particular, Bertozzi has advanced the understanding of cell surface oligosaccharides involved in cell recognition and inter-cellular communication. Bertozzi has applied the techniques of bioorthogonal chemistry to study glycocalyx, the sugars that surround the cell membrane. Her discoveries have advanced the field of biotherapeutics. Her lab has also developed tools for research. One such development is creating chemical tools for studying glycans in living systems. Her lab's development of nanotechnologies which probe biological systems lead to the development of a fast point-of-care tuberculosis test in 2018. In 2017, due to her lab's discovery of linking the sugars on the surface of cancer cells and their ability to avoid the immune system defenses, she was invited to speak at Stanford's TED talk, giving a talk entitled What the sugar coating on your cells is trying to tell you. Biotechnology startups In addition to her academic work, Bertozzi works actively with biotechnology start-ups. She has served on the research advisory board of GlaxoSmithKline. In the early 2000s, Bertozzi and Steve Rosen co-founded Thios Pharmaceuticals the first company to target sulfation pathways. In 2008, Bertozzi founded a startup of her own: Redwood Bioscience of Emeryville, California. Redwood Bioscience is a biotechnology company that uses SMARTag, a site-specific protein modification technology that allows small drugs to attach to sites on the proteins and can be used to help fight cancers. Redwood Bioscience was acquired by Catalent Pharma Solutions in 2014. Bertozzi remains a part of the advisory board for the biologics sector of the company. In 2014, she co-founded Enable Biosciences which focuses on biotechnologies for at-home diagnoses for type 1 diabetes, HIV, and other diseases. Bertozzi became a co-founder of Palleon Pharma of Waltham, Massachusetts in 2015.Palleon Pharma - Leadership Palleon Pharma focuses on investigating glycoimmune checkpoint inhibitors as a potential treatment for cancer. In 2017, Bertozzi helped found InterVenn Biosciences, which uses mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence to enhance glycoproteomics for target and biomarker discovery, ovarian cancer diagnostics, and predicting the successes and failures of clinical trials. She co-founded Grace Science Foundation in 2018. The foundation focuses on curing NGLY1 deficiency through developing therapeutics that are efficient and inexpensive. In 2019 she co-founded both OliLux Biosciences and Lycia Therapeutics. OliLux Biosciences develops new methods for tuberculosis detection. The founding of Lycia Therapeutics occurred when Bertozzi's group discovered lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs). The new molecule class may be able to degrade some cardiovascular disease and cancer targets. Lycia Therapeutics focuses on developing technology which utilizes lysosome- targeting chimeras (LYTACs).

History  The park preserves portions of the former Lock Ridge Iron Works. The first furnace at the site was built in 1868 by the Lock Ridge Iron Company, on the line of the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad near its junction with the East Pennsylvania Railroad. The company was taken over the next year by the Thomas Iron Company, and a second furnace put in blast shortly thereafter. The iron industry in the Lehigh Valley was then flourishing, and the Lock Ridge furnaces (designated No. 7 and No. 8 by Thomas Iron) were typical of the time. They used a hot blast to burn anthracite fuel (rather than the hitherto common charcoal) a technology brought to the United States by the company's founder, David Thomas, in 1839. However, by the early 20th century, the furnaces were, despite sporadic improvements, technologically out-of-date,Bartholomew & Metz, p. 56 and were reputedly the last anthracite iron furnaces to operate in the United States. President B.F. Fackenthal, of Thomas Iron, recommended they be decommissioned upon his resignation in 1913. However, Fackenthal's successor, Ralph Sweetser, pursued the opposite course. No. 8 furnace stack was rebuilt in 1914, and No. 7 the following year.Bartholomew & Metz, p. 62 Concurrently, anthracite was replaced by coke as a fuel for the furnaces.Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 79–80 However, modernization was not enough to save the Lock Ridge furnaces, and iron was last made there in 1921.Bartholomew & Metz, p. 84 The furnaces were sold to William Butz, who dismantled most of the buildings for scrap iron and lumber. However, the masonry structures were allowed to remain, albeit in a decayed condition. The slag dumps on the property were crushed, screened, and used for roofing and fill by the Lehigh Slag Company until 1958. Little-used since the closing of the furnaces, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville's line through the site was torn up in the 1940s. With industrial operations on the property long complete, it was donated by the Butz family to Lehigh County for use as a park.Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 84–86  The Park Today  Lock Ridge Park was opened in August 1976 as a park. Today it is operated as a partnership between the County of Lehigh, which owns and maintains the site, and the Lehigh County Historical Society, which provides public tours of the furnace complex. The park is made up of the remains of the old furnace complex, now the Lock Ridge Furnace Museum, and the land surrounding it. Swabia Creek, which flows through the park grounds, offers limited fishing. The park also features a Little League Baseball field and a picnic pavilion with restrooms and a fireplace. The park also features a self- guided walking tour of the site.Lock Ridge Park and Furnace Museum, pub. by Lehigh County Notes  References Category:Museums in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania Category:Industry museums in Pennsylvania Category:Parks in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania Category:1976 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Lock Ridge Park"},{"id":"8151064","text":"The rational planning model is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps. Taylor (1998) outlines five steps, as follows: * Definition of the problems and/or goals; * Identification of alternative plans/policies; * Evaluation of alternative plans/policies; * Implementation of plans/policies; * Monitoring of effects of plans/policies. The rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods, cities, and regions. It has been central in the development of modern urban planning and transportation planning. The model has many limitations, particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning, and other models of planning, such as collaborative planning, are now also widely used. The very similar rational decision-making model, as it is called in organizational behavior, is a process for making logically sound decisions. This multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Method Rational decision-making or planning follows a series of steps detailed below: Verify, define, detail the problem, give solution or alternative to the problem  Verifying, defining & detailing the problem (problem definition, goal definition, information gathering). This step includes recognizing the problem, defining an initial solution, and starting primary analysis. Examples of this are creative devising, creative ideas, inspirations, breakthroughs, and brainstorms. The very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level management is defining the exact problem. Though we think that the problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Generate all possible solutions This step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site. In planning, examples of this are Planned Units of Development and downtown revitalizations. This activity is best done in groups, as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem. Without alternative solutions, there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision. For exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information. Technology may help with gathering this information. Generate objective assessment criteria Evaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives. This step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem. Examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis. After going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem, exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of. At this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered. The rational model of planning rest largely on objective assessment. Choose the best solution generated This step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site. At this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site. Based on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps, choose the best solution generated. These four steps form the core of the Rational Decision Making Model. Implement the preferred alternative This step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site. This step is the building/renovations part of the process. Monitor and evaluate outcomes and results This step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site. This step takes place over a long period of time.  Feedback Modify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes. Discourse of rational planning model used in policy making The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”. It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work, such as: *The model must be applied in a system that is stable, *The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices, *The policy problem is unambiguous, *There are no limitations of time or cost. Indeed, some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states: In its purest form, the Rational Actor approach presumes that such a figure [as Constantine] has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives. At the same time, it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented. There are no staffs on which to rely, no constituencies to placate, no generals or governors to cajole. By attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options, the Rational Actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues. Furthermore, as we have seen, in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. For this purpose, Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows: #Intelligence gathering— data and potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed. #Identifying problems #Assessing the consequences of all options #Relating consequences to values— with all decisions and policies there will be a set of values which will be more relevant (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and which can be expressed as a set of criteria, against which performance (or consequences) of each option can be judged. #Choosing the preferred option— given the full understanding of all the problems and opportunities, all the consequences and the criteria for judging options. In similar lines, Wiktorowicz and Deber describe through their study on ‘Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political model of policy development’ the rational approach to policy development. The main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following: #The comprehensive organization and analysis of the information #The potential consequences of each option #The probability that each potential outcome would materialize #The value (or utility) placed on each potential outcome. The approach of Wiktorowicz and Deber is similar to Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each policy option is assessed. Many authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps, amongst others, Patton and Sawicki who summarize the model as presented in the following figure (missing): #Defining the problem by analyzing the data and the information gathered. #Identifying the decision criteria that will be important in solving the problem. The decision maker must determine the relevant factors to take into account when making the decision. #A brief list of the possible alternatives must be generated; these could succeed to resolve the problem. #A critical analyses and evaluation of each criterion is brought through. For example, strength and weakness tables of each alternative are drawn and used for comparative basis. The decision maker then weights the previously identified criteria in order to give the alternative policies a correct priority in the decision. #The decision-maker evaluates each alternative against the criteria and selects the preferred alternative. #The policy is brought through. The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill- defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book \`Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage: There is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than in the field of health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that is, whether we live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike? The problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around. Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context. However, as Thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”. Decision criteria for policy analysis — Step 2 As illustrated in Figure 1, rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis. Step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process. At this part of the process, all the economic, social, and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria. For example, the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of — * Ecological impacts — such as biodiversity, water quality, air quality, habitat quality, species population, etc. * Economic efficiency — commonly expressed as benefits and costs. * Distributional equity — how policy impacts are distributed amongst different demographics. Factors that can affect the distribution of impacts include location, ethnicity, income, and occupation. * Social/Cultural acceptability — the extent to which the policy action may be opposed by current social norms or cultural values. * Operational practicality — the capacity required to actually operationalize the policy. * Legality — the potential for the policy to be implemented under current legislation versus the need to pass new legislation that accommodates the policy. * Uncertainty — the degree to which the level of policy impacts can be known. Some criteria, such as economic benefit, will be more easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals. The process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface. For example, decision makers may tend to give \\"more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated, tangible, certain, and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse, intangible, uncertain, and delayed.\\"^8. For example, with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country's improved position to influence global negotiations on climate change action. Decision methods for policy analysis — Step 5 Displaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) such that shown in Table 1. As shown, a PAM provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives. Table 1. Policy analysis matrix (PAM) for SO2 emissions control. Once policy alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA). At the other extreme, the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being. Weimer and Vining also suggest that the \\"go, no go\\" rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion \\"is to minimize SO2 emissions\\" and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions \\"of at least 8.0 million tons per year\\". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a \\"go\\" for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made. Case study of rational policy analysis To demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above, let’s examine the policy paper “Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy” by Lisa Ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) between 2005–2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities. Considering the steps of Patton and Sawicki model as in Figure 1 above, this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model: # Defining The Problem – the report identifies transportation fuels pose two important challenges for the European Union (EU). First, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to the Climate Change Convention, the EU has agreed to an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions; while, at the same time increased consumption of transportation fuels has resulted in a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from this source. Second, the dependence upon oil imports from the politically volatile Middle East generates concern over price fluctuations and possible interruptions in supply. Alternative fuel sources need to be used & substituted in place of fossil fuels to mitigate GHG emissions in the EU. # Determine the Evaluation Criteria – this policy sets Environmental impacts/benefits (reduction of GHG’s as a measure to reducing climate change effects) and Economical efficiency (the costs of converting to biofuels as alternative to fossil fuels & the costs of production of biofuels from its different potential sources) as its decision criteria. However, this paper does not exactly talk about the social impacts, this policy may have. It also does not compare the operational challenges involved between the different categories of biofuels considered. # Identifying Alternative Policies – The European Commission foresees that three alternative transport fuels: hydrogen, natural gas, and biofuels, will replace transport fossil fuels, each by 5% by 2020. # Evaluating Alternative Policies – Biofuels are an alternative motor vehicle fuel produced from biological material and are promoted as a transitional step until more advanced technologies have matured. By modelling the efficiency of the biofuel options the authors compute the economic and environmental costs of each biofuel option as per the evaluation criteria mentioned above. # Select The Preferred Policy – The authors suggest that the overall best biofuel comes from the sugarcane in Brazil after comparing the economic & the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO2 emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in the volume of the business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially. Requirements and limitations However, there are a lot of assumptions, requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure. Therefore, they all have to be considered. The model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information, both in terms of quality, quantity and accuracy. This applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations. It further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives. In other words, it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen. It further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it. The following are the limitations for the Rational Decision Making Model: * requires a great deal of time * requires great deal of information * assumes rational, measurable criteria are available and agreed upon * assumes accurate, stable and complete knowledge of all the alternatives, preferences, goals and consequences * assumes a rational, reasonable, non – political world Current status While the rational planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and questionable processes today. The rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade. Rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners, Lucy Suchman argues, agents can better be understood as engaging in situated action. Going further, Guy Benveniste argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account.

Life and career Early life Born in London, the daughter of a retired sea captain, Varden was a child prodigy. She trained as a concert pianist in Paris and performed in England before deciding to take up acting. She studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and made her first appearance as Mrs Darling in Peter Pan. Theatre career In England, Varden was a protege of actress Kate Rorke. She acted in repertory theatre and made her West End debut in The Wandering Jew in 1920. From Shakespeare to farce, she established herself as a regular member of the Aldwych Theatre company where she appeared in plays from 1929 to 1933. She began to appear in British films, usually in haughty upper-class roles. Move to America and film career Varden's English film roles led to offers from Hollywood, and she moved there at the start of World War II, beginning a long career of playing character and supporting roles. Notable films Varden appeared in include Casablanca (1942), The Major and the Minor (1942), The White Cliffs of Dover (1944), National Velvet (1944), The Green Years (1946), Forever Amber (1947), Strangers on a Train (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), Jupiter's Darling (1955), and Witness for the Prosecution (1957). She played the housekeeper Frau Schmidt in The Sound of Music (1965). Two years later, she had a minor part as Lady Petherington in Doctor Dolittle (1967). Television career She had a recurring role in the 1960s NBC sitcom Hazel as Harriet Johnson. She appeared on CBS's I Love Lucy as \\"Mrs. Benson\\", the neighbour with whom the Ricardos switch apartments after the birth of Little Ricky in 1953. She was cast as Mrs. Murdock in the 1961 episode \\"The Swedish Girl\\" on ABC's The Real McCoys. She appeared on CBS's Perry Mason as Winifred Wileen in the 1964 episode, \\"The Case of the Illicit Illusion\\". That same year, Varden, along with veteran character actress and comedienne Kathleen Freeman were featured in a third season episode of The Lucy Show entitled \\"Lucy Gets Her Maid\\". In that installment, Varden played yet another snooty socialite named Mrs. Van Vlack who hires Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Ball) as a maid. She also appeared on the 7th season episode of The Beverly Hillbillies \\"Problem Bear\\" as the snobby socialite, Mrs. Vanransenhoff, who went home with Granny to get gossip on Mrs. Drysdale. Varden played Mrs. Dumont in a 1966 (Season 3, Ep.11) episode of Bewitched entitled \\"Oedipus Hex\\", sitting on a \\"Ways & Means\\" charity committee with Samantha Stephens to raise funds for a children's playground. Varden played Mrs. Hermione Monteagle in episode 13 of the Batman series of the 1960s. Personal life She became a naturalised United States citizen on 28 January 1949.Naturalization paperwork for Norma Varden, ancestry.com. Retrieved 13 October 2015.

Biography He was a descendant of Solomon Luria, and traced his genealogy back through Rashi to the tanna Johanan HaSandlar. He was rabbi of , Minsk Voivodeship until 1711, when he was called to the rabbinate of Minsk, where he officiated also as head of the yeshivah until his death. Heilprin was one of the most eminent Talmudists of his time. He was opposed to casuistry, and on this account succeeded in grouping around him a great number of liberal-minded pupils. For a long time he had to sustain a hard struggle with Aryeh Leib ben Asher Gunzberg, who, while still a young man, had founded a yeshivah at Minsk, which at first was very flourishing. Aryeh Leib attacked Heilprin's method of teaching, and the antagonism between them spread to their pupils. Later, Aryeh Leib, being obliged to assist his father in the district rabbinate, neglected his yeshivah, which was ultimately closed, and Heilprin was no longer interfered with. Heilprin devoted a part of his time to the study of Kabbalah, on which subject he wrote a work. He was opposed to giving approbations to new books, deviating, as he himself says, only twice from his general principle in this regard. The two works so favored were the Ir Ḥomah of Abraham Judah Elijah and the Magen HaElef of Aryeh Löb of Plock. Seder HaDorot Heilprin is especially known through his Seder HaDorot. This work consists of three independent volumes or parts: * The first of these, entitled Yemot Olam, is a history from the Creation down to his own time. The author always endeavors to give, by means of calculation, the dates of Biblical personages. He bases his work on the Yuḥasin of Abraham Zacuto, on the Shalshelet HaKabbalah of Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya, and on the Ẓemaḥ Dawid of David Gans. It seems that this first part was written when the author was still young, for the last event which he registered was one occurring in 1697. * The second part, Seder HaTanna'im VehaAmoraim, contains lists of the Tannaim and Amoraim in alphabetical order with their dates. * The third part is a kind of catalogue containing first the names of all the authors, then those of their works, both arranged in alphabetical order. Heilprin based this part on the Sifte Yeshenim of Shabbethai Bass, but added a great number of other titles. He states in the preface the many advantages of a knowledge of the chronological order of the Talmudists, which indeed in certain cases is absolutely necessary. The whole work is followed by notes on the Talmud, also arranged in alphabetical order. It was published for the first time by Heilprin's grandson, Judah Löb Heilprin, at Carlsruhe in 1769. There exist several other editions, the latest (as of 1906) being the revised one of Naphtali Maskileison, son of Abraham Maskileison, Warsaw, 1882. Of Heilprin's numerous other works mentioned in the Seder HaDorot, the only one which has been published is Erke HaKinnuyim, a dictionary of synonyms and homonyms occurring in the Bible, Talmud, and other works, chiefly kabbalistic (Dyhernfurth, 1806).

Matilda of Hainaut (29 November 1293 - 1331) was the Princess of Achaea from 1313 to 1318. She was the daughter of Isabella of Villehardouin and her husband Florent of Hainaut. In 1299, while still a child, she had been married to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens. Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long-extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut. On Isabella's death, however, Ferdinand of Majorca laid claim to the principality in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran, the daughter of Isabella's younger sister Margaret of Villehardouin. The new couple quickly left for Greece to take possession of their fief, which was then occupied by their rival Ferdinand. At the Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, Ferdinand was vanquished and killed and Louis took control of the Elis. However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23-year-old in charge of the Achaea. It was soon disputed by the varying claimants and Matilda was solidly dispossessed of her fief by 1318, in which year John, Duke of Durazzo, an Angevin, abducted the princess and forced her to marry him. She did not give him children, however, and he repudiated her in 1321. Matilda married yet again to Hugh de La Palice and retired to Aversa, where she died in 1331.

It specifically refers to the areas that may be searched in pursuit of the items stipulated in the warrant in relation to evidence of any other criminal acts which may be recovered. The maxim (often quoted as \\"if you are looking for stolen televisions, you cannot look in sugar bowls\\") describes the relationship between what is described in a search warrant and the persons or things that may be validly searched as a consequence. Under the law, only those areas that could realistically contain the objects searched for can be searched, and as such only evidence of other crimes found in those areas (or in plain sight) can be admitted. In the eponymous example, if the search warrant states that a stolen television is the object of the search, a law enforcement officer cannot look into a person's sugar bowl for what might be other stolen property (as, of course, a television would not fit inside a sugar bowl). However, the officer may look into other concealed areas where a television may be hidden, such as a closet, attic, or outside shed. On the other hand, if the search warrant stated that a stolen ring was the subject, since a ring can easily be concealed inside a sugar bowl, the officer may search inside the bowl. An extension of this concept prevents search through possessions that could not possibly be the object in question. If stolen televisions are exclusively the subject of the warrant then officers could not read through paperwork or the contents of computers found at the scene even if the televisions could reasonably be hidden among large stacks of paper or amongst computer equipment. Televisions could not be hidden inside a folder of papers, or stored on a hard drive, thus excluding those from being searched. Similarly, those executing the warrant may not use search techniques that are not specifically used to find the target. In the setting of a building, drug dogs cannot be used unless drugs are specified in the warrant, while outside a metal detector could only be used if the item could be detected by it. Generally these issues do not become relevant, as investigators are careful to apply for warrants that cover the maximum areas that there is evidence to allow for. If there is evidence to support the issuing of a warrant to find stolen televisions, investigators may apply for one that includes stolen televisions, parts of televisions, sums of cash and records of the sale of televisions, on the rationale that possession of a large number of stolen items constitutes evidence of participating in a trade in stolen objects. As cash can be stored in a sugar bowl, this allows for the search of almost everywhere. Conversely such warrants risk becoming effective general warrants which are prohibited under the Fourth Amendment. There are some cases where even a warrant that only specifies a single item to be looked for can reasonably be applied to almost every conceivable area, most notably illegal drugs which could be present in almost any quantity from milligrams to kilograms, thus reasonably being concealed in almost anything. In effect, the sugar bowl is a reminder to law enforcement to carefully stipulate their warrants and not to use speculative warrants to search for evidence of serious crimes. Even if such evidence is found, if it is outside the scope of the areas the warrant permits then it is very likely to be excluded from trial as an illegal search and seizure.

Research was conducted and prototypes built between the 1960s and 2019. The concept was taken further by physicist Robert Bussard. His company, EMC2, Inc., developed prototypical devices for the U.S. Navy. Current research by the University of Sydney seems to show that the design is impractical (or impossible) in practice. The design was related to the fusor, the high beta fusion reactor, the magnetic mirror, and the biconic cusp. A set of electromagnets generates a magnetic field that traps electrons. This creates a negative voltage, which attracts positive ions. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their kinetic energy rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can fuse.  Mechanism   Fusor  A homemade fusor Farnsworth–Hirsch fusor during operation in so called \\"star mode\\" characterized by \\"rays\\" of glowing plasma which appear to emanate from the gaps in the inner grid. A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor consists of two wire cages, one inside the other, often referred to as grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. A fuel, typically, deuterium gas, is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly through the center of the device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, a Coulomb force impels them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma, as well as spall off metal ions into the gas, which cools it. In fusors, the potential well is made with a wire cage. Because most of the ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high conduction losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even. Figure 1: Illustration of the basic mechanism of fusion in fusors. (1) The fusor contains two concentric wire cages. The cathode (blue) is inside the anode (red). (2) Positive ions are attracted to the inner cathode. The electric field does work on the ions heating them to fusion conditions. (3) The ions miss the inner cage. (4) The ions collide in the center and may fuse.  Polywell  Figure 1: Sketch of a MaGrid in a polywell The main problem with the fusor is that the inner cage conducts away too much energy and mass. The solution, suggested by Robert Bussard and Oleg Lavrentiev, was to replace the negative cage with a \\"virtual cathode\\" made of a cloud of electrons. A polywell consists of several parts. These are put inside a vacuum chamber * A set of positively charged electromagnet coils arranged in a polyhedron. The most common arrangement is a six sided cube. The six magnetic poles are pointing in the same direction toward the center. The magnetic field vanishes at the center by symmetry, creating a null point. * Electron guns facing ring axis. These shoot electrons into the center of the ring structure. Once inside, the electrons are confined by the magnetic fields. This has been measured in polywells using Langmuir probes. Electrons that have enough energy to escape through the magnetic cusps can be re-attracted to the positive rings. They can slow down and return to the inside of the rings along the cusps. This reduces conduction losses, and improves the overall performance of the machine.Lawson, J. D. (December 1955). Some Criteria for a Power producing thermonuclear reactor (PDF) (Technical report). Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Berkshire, U. K. A.E.R.E. GP/R 1807. The electrons act as a negative voltage drop attracting positive ions. This is a virtual cathode. * Gas puffers at corner. Gas is puffed inside the rings where it ionizes at the electron cloud. As ions fall down the potential well, the electric field works on them, heating it to fusion conditions. The ions build up speed. They can slam together in the center and fuse. Ions are electrostatically confined raising the density and increasing the fusion rate. The magnetic energy density required to confine electrons is far smaller than that required to directly confine ions, as is done in other fusion projects such as ITER.  Magnetic trapping models  Figure 2: A plot of the magnetic field generated by the MaGrid inside a polywell. The null point is marked in red in the center. Magnetic fields exert a pressure on the plasma. Beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic field strength. It can be defined separately for electrons and ions. The polywell concerns itself only for the electron beta, whereas the ion beta is of greater interest within Tokamak and other neutral-plasma machines. The two vary by a very large ratio, because of the enormous difference in mass between an electron and any ion. Typically in other devices the electron beta is neglected, as the ion beta determines more important plasma parameters. This is a significant point of confusion for scientists more familiar with more 'conventional' fusion plasma physics. Note that for the electron beta, only the electron number density and temperature are used, as both of these, but especially the latter, can vary significantly from the ion parameters at the same location. \\\\beta_e = \\\\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\\\frac{n_e k_B T_e}{(B^2/2\\\\mu_0)}Wesson, J: \\"Tokamaks\\", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004 Most experiments on polywells involve low-beta plasma regimes (where β < 1), where the plasma pressure is weak compared to the magnetic pressure. Several models describe magnetic trapping in polywells. Tests indicated that plasma confinement is enhanced in a magnetic cusp configuration when β (plasma pressure/magnetic field pressure) is of order unity. This enhancement is required for a fusion power reactor based on cusp confinement to be feasible.  Magnetic mirror  Magnetic mirror dominates in low beta designs. Both ions and electrons are reflected from high to low density fields. This is known as the magnetic mirror effect.\\"Mirror Systems: Fuel Cycles, loss reduction and energy recovery\\" by Richard F. Post, BNES Nuclear fusion reactor conferences at Culham laboratory, September 1969. The polywell's rings are arranged so the densest fields are on the outside, trapping electrons in the center. This can trap particles at low beta values.  Cusp confinement  Figure 3: Polywell cusps. The line cusp runs along the seam between two electromagnets. The funny cusp is the cusp between three magnets, running along the corners. The point cusp lies in the middle of one electromagnet. In high beta conditions, the machine may operate with cusp confinement.Park, Jaeyoung (12 June 2014). SPECIAL PLASMA SEMINAR: Measurement of Enhanced Cusp Confinement at High Beta (Speech). Plasma Physics Seminar. Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of California, Irvine: Energy Matter Conversion Corp (EMC2). This is an improvement over the simpler magnetic mirror. The MaGrid has six point cusps, each located in the middle of a ring; and two highly modified line cusps, linking the eight corner cusps located at cube vertices. The key is that these two line cusps are much narrower than the single line cusp in magnetic mirror machines, so the net losses are less. The two line cusps losses are similar to or lower than the six face-centered point cusps.  Free-boundary plasma  In 1955, Harold Grad theorized that a high-beta plasma pressure combined with a cusped magnetic field would improve plasma confinement. A diamagnetic plasma rejects the external fields and plugs the cusps. This system would be a much better trap. Cusped confinement was explored theoreticallymagnetohydrodynamic stability, j Berkowitz, h grad, p/376 and experimentally.review paper, m g Haines, nuclear fusion, 17 4(1977) However, most cusped experiments failed and disappeared from national programs by 1980. Bussard later called this type of confinement the Wiffle-Ball. This analogy was used to describe electron trapping inside the field. Marbles can be trapped inside a Wiffle ball, a hollow, perforated sphere; if marbles are put inside, they can roll and sometimes escape through the holes in the sphere. The magnetic topology of a high-beta polywell acts similarly with electrons. For many decades, cusped confinement never behaved experimentally as was predicted. Sharply bent fields were used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in a series of magnetic mirror machines from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a tokamak. Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist. In June 2014 EMC2 published a preprint providing evidence that the effect is real, based on x-ray measurements and magnetic flux measurements during its experiment. According to Bussard, typical cusp leakage rate is such that an electron makes 5 to 8 passes before escaping through a cusp in a standard mirror confinement biconic cusp; 10 to 60 passes in a polywell under mirror confinement (low beta) that he called cusp confinement; and several thousand passes in Wiffle- Ball confinement (high beta). In February 2013, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works announced a new compact fusion machine, the high beta fusion reactor, that may be related to the biconic cusp and the polywell, and working at β = 1\\\\.  Other behavior   Single-electron motion  Figure 4: Illustration of single electron motion inside the polywell. It is based on figures from \\"Low beta confinement in a polywell modeled with conventional point cusp theories\\" but is not an exact copy. As an electron enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, every time it changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards the edges of the MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes. The polywell attempts to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons are easier to confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions. The machine confines ions using an electric field in the same way a fusor confines the ions: in the polywell, the ions are attracted to the negative electron cloud in the center. In the fusor, they are attracted to a negative wire cage in the center.  Plasma recirculation  Plasma recirculation would significantly improve the function of these machines. It has been argued that efficient recirculation is the only way they can be viable. Electrons or ions move through the device without striking a surface, reducing conduction losses. Bussard stressed this; specifically emphasizing that electrons need to move through all cusps of the machine. Figure 5: Thermalized plasma ion energy distribution inside a polywell. This model assumes a maxwellian ion population, broken into different groups. (1) The ions which do not have enough energy to fuse, (2) the ions at the injection energy (3) the ions that have so much kinetic energy that they escape.  Models of energy distribution  Figure 6: Non- thermalized plasma energy distribution inside a polywell.\\"A biased probe analysis of potential well formation in an electron only, low beta Polywell magnetic field\\" Physics of Plasma It is argued that the region of unmagnetized space leads to electron scattering, this leads to a monoenergetic distribution with a cold electron tail. This is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. it had not been determined conclusively what the ion or electron energy distribution is. The energy distribution of the plasma can be measured using a Langmuir probe. This probe absorbs charge from the plasma as its voltage changes, making an I-V Curve.E. V. Shun'ko. \\"Langmuir Probe in Theory and Practice\\". Universal Publishers, Boca Raton, Fl. 2008. p. 243. . From this signal, the energy distribution can be calculated. The energy distribution both drives and is driven by several physical rates, the electron and ion loss rate, the rate of energy loss by radiation, the fusion rate and the rate of non-fusion collisions. The collision rate may vary greatly across the system: * At the edge: where ions are slow and the electrons are fast. * At the center: where ions are fast and electrons are slow. Critics claimed that both the electrons and ion populations have bell curve distribution; that the plasma is thermalized. The justification given is that the longer the electrons and ions move inside the polywell, the more interactions they undergo leading to thermalization. This model for the ion distribution is shown in Figure 5. Supporters modeled a nonthermal plasma. The justification is the high amount of scattering in the device center.M. Carr, D. Gummersall, S. Cornish, and J. Khachan, Phys. Plasmas 18, 112501 (2011) Without a magnetic field, electrons scatter in this region. They claimed that this scattering leads to a monoenergetic distribution, like the one shown in Figure 6. This argument is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Bussard argued that constant electron injection would have the same effect. Such a distribution would help maintain a negative voltage in the center, improving performance.  Considerations for net power   Fuel type  Figure 7: Plot of the cross section of different fusion reactions. Nuclear fusion refers to nuclear reactions that combine lighter nuclei to become heavier nuclei. All chemical elements can be fused; for elements with fewer protons than iron, this process changes mass into energy that can potentially be captured to provide fusion power. The probability of a fusion reaction occurring is controlled by the cross section of the fuel,\\"Development of the indirect drive approach to inertial confinement fusion and the target physics basis for ignition and gain\\" John Lindl, Physics of Plasma, 1995 which is in turn a function of its temperature. The easiest nuclei to fuse are deuterium and tritium. Their fusion occurs when the ions reach 4 keV (kiloelectronvolts), or about 45 million kelvins. The Polywell would achieve this by accelerating an ion with a charge of 1 down a 4,000 volt electric field. The high cost, short half-life and radioactivity of tritium make it difficult to work with. The second easiest reaction is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium is commonly used by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this reaction is aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency“Experimental Results from a beam direct converter at 100 kV” journal of fusion energy, Volume 2, Number 2, (1982) by R. W. MOIR, W. L. BARR. against 80–90% theoretical efficiency.  Lawson criterion  The energy generated by fusion inside a hot plasma cloud can be found with the following equation: :P_\\\\text{fusion} = n_A n_B \\\\langle \\\\sigma v_{A,B} \\\\rangle E_\\\\text{fusion} where: * P_\\\\text{fusion} is the fusion power density (energy per time per volume), * n is the number density of species A or B (particles per volume), * \\\\langle \\\\sigma v_{A,B} \\\\rangle is the product of the collision cross-section σ (which depends on the relative velocity) and the relative velocity of the two species v, averaged over all the particle velocities in the system. Energy varies with temperature, density, collision speed and fuel. To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly enough to make up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output. Net Power = Efficiency × (Fusion − Radiation Loss − Conduction Loss) * Net Power — power output * Efficiency — fraction of energy needed to drive the device and convert it to electricity. * Fusion — energy generated by the fusion reactions. * Radiation — energy lost as light, leaving the plasma. * Conduction — energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma. Lawson used this equation to estimate conditions for net power based on a Maxwellian cloud. However, the Lawson criterion does not apply for Polywells if Bussard's conjecture that the plasma is nonthermal is correct. Lawson stated in his founding report: \\"It is of course easy to postulate systems in which the velocity distribution of the particle is not Maxwellian. These systems are outside the scope of this report.\\" He also ruled out the possibility of a nonthermal plasma to ignite: \\"Nothing may be gained by using a system in which electrons are at a lower temperature [than ions]. The energy loss in such a system by transfer to the electrons will always be greater than the energy which would be radiated by the electrons if they were the [same] temperature.\\"  Criticism  Todd Rider calculated that X-ray radiation losses with this fuel would exceed fusion power production by at least 20%. Rider's model used the following assumptions: * The plasma was quasineutral. Therefore, positives and negatives equally mixed together. * The fuel was evenly mixed throughout the volume. * The plasma was isotropic, meaning that its behavior was the same in any given direction. * The plasma had a uniform energy and temperature throughout the cloud. * The plasma was an unstructured Gaussian sphere, with a strongly converged core that represented a small (~1%) part of the total volume. Nevins challenged this assumption, stating that the particles would build up angular momentum, causing the dense core to degrade. The loss of density inside the core would reduce fusion rates. * The potential well was broad and flat. Based on these assumptions, Rider used general equationsLyman J Spitzer, \\"The Physics of Fully Ionized Gases\\" 1963 to estimate the rates of different physical effects. These included the loss of ions to up-scattering, the ion thermalization rate, the energy loss due to X-ray radiation and the fusion rate. His conclusions were that the device suffered from \\"fundamental flaws\\". By contrast, Bussard argued that the plasma had a different structure, temperature distribution and well profile. These characteristics have not been fully measured and are central to the device's feasibility. Bussard's calculations indicated that the bremsstrahlung losses would be much smaller. According to Bussard the high speed and therefore low cross section for Coulomb collisions of the ions in the core makes thermalizing collisions very unlikely, while the low speed at the rim means that thermalization there has almost no impact on ion velocity in the core. Bussard calculated that a polywell reactor with a radius of 1.5 meters would produce net power fusing deuterium. Other studies disproved some of the assumptions made by Rider and Nevins, arguing the real fusion rate and the associated recirculating power (needed to overcome the thermalizing effect and sustain the non-Maxwellian ion profile) could be estimated only with a self- consistent collisional treatment of the ion distribution function, lacking in Rider's work.  Energy capture  It has been proposed that energy may be extracted from polywells using heat capture or, in the case of aneutronic fusion like D-3He or p-11B, direct energy conversion, though that scheme faces challenges. The energetic alpha particles (up to a few MeV) generated by the aneutronic fusion reaction would exit the MaGrid through the six axial cusps as cones (spread ion beams). Direct conversion collectors inside the vacuum chamber would convert the alpha particles' kinetic energy to a high-voltage direct current. The alpha particles must slow down before they contact the collector plates to realize high conversion efficiency. In experiments, direct conversion has demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 48%.Barr, William, and Ralph Moir. \\"Test Results on Plasma Direct Converters.\\" Nuclear Technology/Fusion 3 (1983): 98-111. Print.  History  In the late 1960s several investigations studied polyhedral magnetic fields as a possibility to confine a fusion plasma. The first proposal to combine this configuration with an electrostatic potential well in order to improve electron confinement was made by Oleg Lavrentiev in 1975. The idea was picked up by Robert Bussard in 1983. His 1989 patent application cited Lavrentiev, although in 2006 he appears to claim to have (re)discovered the idea independently.  HEPS  Research was funded first by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency beginning in 1987 and later by DARPA. This funding resulted in a machine known as the high energy power source (HEPS) experiment. It was built by Directed Technologies Inc.\\"Forming and maintaining a potential well in a quasispherical magnetic trap\\" Nicholas Krall, M Coleman, K Maffei, J Lovberg Physics of Plasma 2 (1), 1995 This machine was a large (1.9 m across) machine, with the rings outside the vacuum chamber. This machine performed poorly because the magnetic fields sent electrons into the walls, driving up conduction losses. These losses were attributed to poor electron injection. The US Navy began providing low-level funding to the project in 1992. Krall published results in 1994. Bussard, who had been an advocate for Tokamak research, turned to advocate for this concept, so that the idea became associated with his name. In 1995 he sent a letter to the US Congress stating that he had only supported Tokamaks in order to get fusion research sponsored by the government, but he now believed that there were better alternatives.  EMC2, Inc.  Bussard founded Energy/Matter Conversion Corporation, Inc. (aka EMC2) in 1985 and after the HEPS program ended, the company continued its research. Successive machines were made, evolving from WB-1 to WB-8. The company won an SBIR I grant in 1992–93 and an SBIR II grant in 1994–95, both from the US Navy. In 1993, it received a grant from the Electric Power Research Institute. In 1994, The company received small grants from NASA and LANL. Starting in 1999, the company was primarily funded by the US Navy. WB-1 had six conventional magnets in a cube. This device was 10 cm across. WB-2 used coils of wires to generate the magnetic field. Each electromagnet had a square cross section that created problems. The magnetic fields drove electrons into the metal rings, raising conduction losses and electron trapping. This design also suffered from \\"funny cusp\\" losses at the joints between magnets. WB-6 attempted to address these problems, by using circular rings and spacing further apart. The next device, PXL-1, was built in 1996 and 1997. This machine was 26 cm across and used flatter rings to generate the field. From 1998 to 2005 the company built a succession of six machines: WB-3, MPG-1,2, WB-4, PZLx-1, MPG-4 and WB-5. All of these reactors were six magnet designs built as a cube or truncated cube. They ranged from 3 to 40 cm in radius. Initial difficulties in spherical electron confinement led to the 2005 research project's termination. However, Bussard reported a fusion rate of 109 per second running D-D fusion reactions at only 12.5 kV (based on detecting nine neutrons in five tests,\\"The Advent of Clean Nuclear Fusion: Super-performance Space Power and Propulsion\\" , Robert W. Bussard, Ph.D., 57th International Astronautical Congress, October 2–6, 2006Final Successful Tests of WB-6, EMC2 Report, currently (July 2008) not publicly available giving a wide confidence interval). He stated that the fusion rate achieved by WB-6 was roughly 100,000 times greater than what Farnsworth achieved at similar well depth and drive conditions. By comparison, researchers at University of Wisconsin–Madison reported a neutron rate of up to 5×109 per second at voltages of 120 kV from an electrostatic fusor without magnetic fields. Bussard asserted, by using superconductor coils, that the only significant energy loss channel is through electron losses proportional to the surface area. He also stated that the density would scale with the square of the field (constant beta conditions), and the maximum attainable magnetic field would scale with the radius. Under those conditions, the fusion power produced would scale with the seventh power of the radius, and the energy gain would scale with the fifth power. While Bussard did not publicly document the reasoning underlying this estimate, Possibly he assumed that the ion energy distribution is fixed, that the magnetic field scales with the linear size, and that the ion pressure (proportional to density) scales with the magnetic pressure (proportional to B²). The R7 scaling results from multiplying the fusion power density (proportional to density squared, or B4) with the volume (proportional toR³). On the other hand, if it is important to maintain the ratio of the Debye length or the gyroradius to the machine size, then the magnetic field strength would have to scale inversely with the radius, so that the total power output would actually be lower in a larger machine. if true, it would enable a model only ten times larger to be useful as a fusion power plant.  WB-6  Funding became tighter and tighter. According to Bussard, \\"The funds were clearly needed for the more important War in Iraq.\\" An extra $900k of Office of Naval Research funding allowed the program to continue long enough to reach WB-6 testing in November 2005. WB-6 had rings with circular cross sections that space apart at the joints. This reduced the metal surface area unprotected by magnetic fields. These changes dramatically improved system performance, leading to more electron recirculation and better electron confinement, in a progressively tighter core. This machine produced a fusion rate of 109 per second. This is based on a total of nine neutrons in five tests, giving a wide confidence interval. Drive voltage on the WB-6 tests was about 12.5 kV, with a resulting potential well depth of about 10 kV. Thus deuterium ions could have a maximum of 10 keV of kinetic energy in the center. By comparison, a Fusor running deuterium fusion at 10 kV would produce a fusion rate almost too small to detect. Hirsch reported a fusion rate this high only by driving his machine with a 150 kV drop between the inside and outside cages.Robert L. Hirsch, \\"Inertial- Electrostatic Confinement of Ionized Fusion Gases\\", Journal of Applied Physics, v. 38, no. 7, October 1967 Hirsch also used deuterium and tritium, a much easier fuel to fuse, because it has a higher nuclear cross section. While the WB-6 pulses were sub-millisecond, Bussard felt the physics should represent steady state. A last-minute test of WB-6 ended prematurely when the insulation on one of the hand-wound electromagnets burned through, destroying the device.  Efforts to restart funding  With no more funding during 2006, the project was stalled. This ended the US Navy's 11-year embargo on publication and publicizing between 1994 and 2005.There is this clause in the \\"Solicitation, Offer and Award\\" for the \\"plasma wiffleball development project\\", awarded on March 3, 2009, to Matter Conversion Corporation: > 5252.204-9504 DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACT INFORMATION (NAVAIR) (JAN 2007) (a) The > Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization > any unclassified information (e.g., announcement of contract award), > regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document), pertaining to any part of > this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the > Contracting Officer has given prior written approval.

Subcontractors shall > submit requests for authorization to release through the prime contractor to > the Contracting Officer. The company's military-owned equipment was transferred to SpaceDev, which hired three of the team's researchers. After the transfer, Bussard tried to attract new investors, giving talks trying to raise interest in his design. He gave a talk at Google entitled, \\"Should Google Go Nuclear?\\" He also presented and published an overview at the 57th International Astronautical Congress in October 2006. He presented at an internal Yahoo! Tech Talk on April 10, 2007. and spoke on the internet talk radio show The Space Show on May 8, 2007. Bussard had plans for WB-8 that was a higher-order polyhedron, with 12 electromagnets. However, this design was not used in the actual WB-8 machine. Bussard believed that the WB-6 machine had demonstrated progress and that no intermediate-scale models would be needed. He noted, \\"We are probably the only people on the planet who know how to make a real net power clean fusion system\\" He proposed to rebuild WB-6 more robustly to verify its performance. After publishing the results, he planned to convene a conference of experts in the field in an attempt to get them behind his design. The first step in that plan was to design and build two more small scale designs (WB-7 and WB-8) to determine which full scale machine would be best. He wrote \\"The only small scale machine work remaining, which can yet give further improvements in performance, is test of one or two WB-6-scale devices but with \\"square\\" or polygonal coils aligned approximately (but slightly offset on the main faces) along the edges of the vertices of the polyhedron. If this is built around a truncated dodecahedron, near-optimum performance is expected; about 3–5 times better than WB-6.\\" Bussard died on October 6, 2007 from multiple myeloma at age 79. In 2007, Steven Chu, Nobel laureate and former United States Secretary of Energy, answered a question about polywell at a tech talk at Google. He said: \\"So far, there's not enough information so [that] I can give an evaluation of the probability that it might work or not...But I'm trying to get more information.\\"  Bridge funding 2007–09  =Reassembling team= In August 2007, EMC2 received a $1.8M U.S. Navy contract. Note that this source is a blog and not necessarily reliable. Before Bussard's death in October, 2007, Dolly Gray, who co-founded EMC2 with Bussard and served as its president and CEO, helped assemble scientists in Santa Fe to carry on. The group was led by Richard Nebel and included Princeton trained physicist Jaeyoung Park. Both physicists were on leave from LANL. The group also included Mike Wray, the physicist who ran the key 2005 tests; and Kevin Wray, the computer specialist for the operation. =WB-7= WB-7 was constructed in San Diego and shipped to the EMC2 testing facility. The device was termed WB-7 and like prior editions, was designed by engineer Mike Skillicorn. This machine has a design similar to WB-6. WB-7 achieved \\"1st plasma\\" in early January, 2008. In August 2008, the team finished the first phase of their experiment and submitted the results to a peer review board. Based on this review, federal funders agreed the team should proceed to the next phase. Nebel said \\"we have had some success\\", referring to the team's effort to reproduce the promising results obtained by Bussard. \\"It's kind of a mix\\", Nebel reported. \\"We're generally happy with what we've been getting out of it, and we've learned a tremendous amount\\" he also said. = 2008 = In September 2008 the Naval Air Warfare Center publicly pre-solicited a contract for research on an Electrostatic \\"Wiffle Ball\\" Fusion Device. In October 2008 the US Navy publicly pre-solicited two more contracts with EMC2 the preferred supplier. These two tasks were to develop better instrumentation and to develop an ion injection gun. In December 2008, following many months of review by the expert review panel of the submission of the final WB-7 results, Nebel commented that \\"There's nothing in [the research] that suggests this will not work\\", but \\"That's a very different statement from saying that it will work.\\"  2009 to 2014  2009 In January 2009 the Naval Air Warfare Center pre-solicited another contract for \\"modification and testing of plasma wiffleball 7\\" that appeared to be funding to install the instrumentation developed in a prior contract, install a new design for the connector (joint) between coils, and operate the modified device. The modified unit was called WB-7.1. This pre-solicitation started as a $200k contract but the final award was for $300k. In April 2009, DoD published a plan to provide EMC2 a further $2 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The citation in the legislation was labelled as Plasma Fusion (Polywell) – Demonstrate fusion plasma confinement system for shore and shipboard applications; Joint OSD/USN project. The Recovery Act funded the Navy for $7.86M to construct and test a WB-8. The Navy contract had an option for an additional $4.46M. The new device increased the magnetic field strength eightfold over WB-6. 2010 The team built WB-8 and the computational tools to analyze and understand the data from it. The team relocated to San Diego. 2011 Jaeyoung Park became President. In a May interview, Park commented that \\"This machine [WB8] should be able to generate 1,000 times more nuclear activity than WB-7, with about eight times more magnetic field\\" The first WB-8 plasma was generated on November 1, 2010. By the third quarter over 500 high power plasma shots had been conducted. 2012 As of August 15, the Navy agreed to fund EMC2 with an additional $5.3 million over 2 years to work on pumping electrons into the wiffleball. They planned to integrate a pulsed power supply to support the electron guns (100+A, 10kV). WB-8 operated at 0.8 Tesla. Review of the work produced the recommendation to continue and expand the effort,US Federal Program Data Source stating: \\"The experimental results to date were consistent with the underlying theoretical framework of the polywell fusion concept and, in the opinion of the committee, merited continuation and expansion.\\"Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition p.2.  Going public   2014  In June EMC2 demonstrated for the first time that the electron cloud becomes diamagnetic in the center of a magnetic cusp configuration when beta is high, resolving an earlier conjecture. Whether the plasma is thermalized remains to be demonstrated experimentally. Park presented these findings at various universities,\\"Polywell Fusion – Electric Fusion in a Magnetic Cusp\\" Jaeyoung Park, Friday, December 5, 2014 - 1:00pm to 2:00pm, Physics and Astronomy Building (PAB) Room 4-330, UCLATalk at University of Wisconsin Madison, Monday, June 16, 2:30 PM room 106 ERB, Jaeyoung ParkUniversity of Maryland, Colloquium & Seminars, \\"Measurement of Enhanced Confinement at High Pressure Magnetic Cusp System\\", Jaeyoung Park, September 9th 2014 the Annual 2014 Fusion Power Associates meeting and the 2014 IEC conference.  2015  On January 22, EMC2 presented at Microsoft Research. EMC2 planned a three-year, $30 million commercial research program to prove that the Polywell can work. On March 11, the company filed a patent application that refined the ideas in Bussard's 1985 patent. The article \\"High-Energy Electron Confinement in a Magnetic Cusp Configuration\\" was published in Physical Review X.  2016  On April the 13th, Next Big Future published an article on information of the Wiffle Ball reactor dated to 2013 through the Freedom of Information Act. On May 2, 2016, Jaeyoung Park delivered a lecture at Khon Kaen University in Thailand, with a discussion of the idea that the world has so underestimated the timetable and impact that practical and economic fusion power will have, that its actual arrival will be highly disruptive. Specifically, Professor Park stated that he expected to present \\"final scientific proof of principle for the polywell technology around 2019-2020\\", and expects \\"a first generation commercial fusion reactor being developed by 2030 and then mass production and commercialisation of the technology in the 2030s. This is approximately 30 years faster than expected under the first world government-driven International Thermonuclear Energy Reactor (ITER) project. It would also be tens of billions of dollars cheaper.\\"  2018  In May 2018 Jaeyoung Park and Nicholas Krall filed WIPO Patent WO/2018/208953. \\"Generating nuclear fusion reactions with the use of ion beam injection in high pressure magnetic cusp devices,\\" which describes the polywell device in detail. \\"Final nail\\"? In June 2019, the results of long-running experiments at the University of Sydney (USyd) were published in PhD thesis form by Richard Bowden-Reid. Using an experimental machine built at the University, the team probed the formation of the virtual electrodes. Their work demonstrated that little or no trace of virtual electrode formation could be found. This left a mystery; both their machine and previous experiments showed clear and consistent evidence of the formation of a potential well that was trapping ions, which was previously ascribed to the formation of the electrodes. Exploring this problem, Bowden-Reid developed new field equations for the device that explained the potential well without electrode formation, and demonstrated that this matched both their results and those of previous experiments. Further, exploring the overall mechanism of the virtual electrode concept demonstrated that its interactions with the ions and itself would make it \\"leak\\" at a furious rate. Assuming plasma densities and energies required for net energy production, it was calculated that new electrons would have to be supplied at a rate of 200,000 Amps. This is essentially unfeasible. The paper sums up the results this way: The results were so convincing that it has been described as a \\"final nail in the coffin for polywells.\\" However, Bowden- Reid's research admitted that it had little insight into what EMC2's research and development program entailed due to the lack of published articles and intellectual property restrictions, recommended upgrades to the SDyd machine, and concluded by stating, \\"Continued development of MCVC-0 is required in order to properly rule out the possibility of charge induced potential well formation. Owing to the poor confinement properties of the biconic cusp when compared with the Polywell configuration, it is possible that the observed behaviour is an artefact of insufficient electron injection current... It is hoped that the above upgrades will result in a machine that is capable of generating measurable deuterium-deuterium fusion\\".:149 EMC2's last known publication was on the discovery of an electron gyroradius scale current layer and its relevance to magnetic fusion energy, the Earth's magnetosphere, and sunspots. Related projects Prometheus Fusion Perfection Mark Suppes built a polywell in Brooklyn. He was the first amateur to detect electron trapping using a Langmuir probe inside a polywell. He presented at the 2012 LIFT conference and the 2012 WIRED conference. The project officially ended in July 2013 due to a lack of funding. University of Sydney The University of Sydney in Australia conducts polywell experiments. They published five papers in Physics of Plasmas on this topic.\\"The dependence of potential well formation on the magnetic field strength and electron injection current in a polywell device\\" S. Cornish, D. Gummersall, M. Carr and J. Khachan Phys. Plasmas 21, 092502 (2014) They also published two PhD theses and presented their work at IEC Fusion conferences. A May 2010 paper discussed a small device's ability to capture electrons. The paper posited that the machine had an ideal magnetic field strength that maximized its ability to catch electrons. The paper analyzed magnetic confinement in the polywell using analytical solutions and simulations. The work linked the magnetic confinement in the polywell to magnetic mirror theory. The 2011 work used Particle-in-cell simulations to model particle motion in polywells with a small electron population. Electrons behaved in a similar manner to particles in the biconic cusp. A 2013 paper measured a negative voltage inside a 4-inch aluminum polywell. Tests included measuring an internal beam of electrons, comparing the machine with and without a magnetic field, measuring the voltage at different locations and comparing voltage changes to the magnetic and electric field strength. A 2015 paper entitled \\"Fusion in a magnetically-shielded-grid inertial electrostatic confinement device\\" presented a theory for a gridded inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusion system that shows a net energy gain is possible if the grid is magnetically shielded from ion impact. The analysis indicates that better than break-even performance is possible even in a deuterium-deuterium system at bench-top scales. The proposed device has the unusual property that it can avoid both the cusp losses of traditional magnetic fusion systems and the grid losses of traditional IEC configurations.  Iranian Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute  In November 2012, Trend News Agency reported that the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran had allocated \\"$8 million\\" to inertial electrostatic confinement research and about half had been spent. The funded group published a paper in the Journal of Fusion Energy, which stated that particle-in-cell simulations of a polywell had been conducted. The study suggested that well depths and ion focus control can be achieved by variations of field strength, and referenced older research with traditional fusors. The group had run a fusor in continuous mode at −140 kV and 70 mA of current, with D-D fuel, producing 2×107 neutrons per second.  University of Wisconsin  Researchers performed Vlasov–Poisson, particle-in-cell simulation work on the polywell.

It introduced a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces to provide a means of preserving energy and particle losses that would otherwise be lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremsstrahlung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis. Version 1 of the analytical model was developed by Senior Theoretical Physicist Dr Vladimir Mirnov and demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. These preliminary results were presented at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting. Phase 2 of the model removed key assumptions in the Rider analysis by incorporating a self- consistent treatment of the ion energy distribution (Rider assumed a purely Maxwellian distribution) and the power required to maintain the distribution and ion population. The results yielded an energy distribution that was non- thermal but more Maxwellian than monoenergetic. The input power required to maintain the distribution was calculated to be excessive and ion-ion thermalization was a dominant loss channel. With these additions, a pathway to commercial electricity generation was no longer feasible.

Today he is famous for his strong involvement in social issues at the beginning of 20th century. Biography Radini-Tedeschi was born in Piacenza, the son of a wealthy and noble family. Ordained as a priest in 1879, he became professor of Church law in the diocesan seminary of Piacenza. In 1890 he joined the Secretariat of State of the Holy See and was involved in many diplomatic missions. On 5 January 1905 he was named Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bergamo by Pope Pius X and consecrated by him in the Sistine Chapel. A strong supporter of Catholic trade unions, he strongly backed the workers of a textile plant in Ranica during a labor dispute. Radini-Tedeschi fell ill with cancer and died in the early days of the World War I.

It was based on the Maxim M1910.  History  During World War I and the Russian Civil War, the Soviet army was equipped with light machine guns of foreign manufacture, mostly with the Lewis gun, the Chauchat and the Hotchkiss M1909. By the 1920s, these guns were showing their age, and owing to the Soviet Union's international diplomatic isolation, neither spare parts nor ammunition could be easily obtained for these guns. In 1923 GAU emergency program was initiated for equipping the Red army with a light machine gun chambered for the domestic 7.62×54mmR. The first design submitted was the Maxim-Kolesnikov, designed by Ivan Nikolaevich Kolesnikov at the Kovrov Arms Factory, followed soon thereafter by the Maxim–Tokarev, designed by Fedor Vasilievich Tokarev at the Tula Arsenal. During field tests conducted in early 1925, Tokarev's model proved superior, so it was adopted on May 26. Of the 2,500 Maxim–Tokarev guns were produced by Tula arms factory (TOZ) in 1926–27; 1,400 were supplied to China between 1938 and 1939 in the Sino-Soviet Aid Program. The rest were sent to the Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War It was replaced in Soviet service by the much lighter DP.  Structure  A US Army analysis mentions that \\"Tokarev was doubtless inspired by both the German Parabellum and the British Vickers. The arrangement of the trigger and the shoulder stock resembles very strongly that illustrated in United States Patent No. 942167, which was granted in 1909 to Dawson and Buckham, assignors to Vickers.\\"Chinn, George M. The Machine Gun, Vol II, Part VII. US Department of the Navy, 1952, page 23 The water jacket of the Maxim M1910 was discarded and replaced by a thin perforated steel jacket. The barrel was shortened and lightened from 2.1 kg to 1.7 kg. A mechanism for changing the barrel in field conditions was provided. The spade grips were replaced with a rifle-type stock and the thumb-trigger was replaced by a rifle-type trigger. A folding bipod with tubular legs was attached to the barrel jacket. The canvas-belt feed system was the same as on Maxim M1910 guns, except the standard belt capacity was reduced to 100 rounds. The 100-round belts were usually carried in separate drum-type containers, inspired from the MG 08/15. The barrel rifling was 4 right-turns in 240 mm.

It is situated in the Sombor municipality, in the West Bačka District, Vojvodina province. The village has a Serb ethnic majority and its population is 2,201 (2002 census). Name In Serbian, the village is known as Gakovo (Гаково), in German as Gakowa or Graumarkt, in Hungarian as Gádor or Gákova, in Croatian as Gakovo, and in Bunjevac as Gakovo. Name of the village is of Slavic (Serbo-Croatian) origin and roughly means \\"the place of Gako\\" or \\"the place of Gak\\". Geography Gakovo is located in north-western Bačka near the border with Hungary between the Tisa and Danube rivers. A small neighbouring settlement known as Kruševlje is also officially regarded as part of Gakovo. Gakovo lies at an altitude of 96 meters. History From 1658 name Gakovo was used for an uninhabited area that was under Ottoman administration. Village of Gakovo was formed during Habsburg administration in the first half of the 18th century. According to the sources, this village existed in 1728 and was populated by \\"Šijaks\\" (Serbs from Croatia).Dr Slobodan Ćurčić, Naselja Bačke - geografske karakteristike, Novi Sad, 2007, p. 379. In 1748, some Austro-Hungarians (Danube Swabians) from Apatin and Kruševlje settled here as well and it was one of the first settlements in Bačka that was colonized by Austro-Hungarians. Another wave of Danube Swabian colonists came between 1763-68. Some colonists were from the upper Danube region, Baden-Württemberg (Swabian), and Alsace-Lorraine (Alsatian), but some were from other areas of the Habsburg Monarchy such as Bohemia, Slovakia, Hungary, etc. In 1787, population of Gakovo numbered 1,522 inhabitants. Until 1848, the village was part of the Batsch-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848-49, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and from 1849-60 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, which was a separate Habsburg crownland. After abolishment of the voivodeship, in 1860, Gakovo was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County. In 1910, population of the village numbered 2,770 inhabitants, mostly Danube Swabians. Some village residents emigrated to the United States, Canada and Argentina beginning in the early 1900s, before the World War I. A second emigration wave set out from 1925 to 1930. In 1918, the village became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918-22, the village was part of the Novi Sad County, from 1922-29 part of Bačka Oblast, and from 1929-41 part of Danube Banovina. From 1941-44, the village was under Axis occupation and was officially part of Hungary. World War II In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis forces from the region and village was included into new socialist Yugoslavia. For many reasons that historians are still uncertain and divided about, new Yugoslav authorities sent those Gakovans who remained in the country into internment camps. (Many Gakovans, however, had left the country in 1944, following the defeated German Army.) Gakovo was one of the sites of these post-World War II internment camps for the ethnic Germans (Danube Swabians). Gakovo and the nearby village of Kruševlje had at its maximum about 30,000 detainees, of whom between 11,000 and 12,000 died as the Serbian authorities deliberately created starvation conditions and extreme crowding, withheld water, and beat and shot the ethnic German civilians.Steinmetz, Greg. \\"Northern Yugoslavia, 1946: According to official history, this ethnic purge never happened\\", Chicago Tribune, 12 November 1992. The local population was strictly forbidden from helping their former neighbors with food. Internment camps were abolished in 1948Janjetović, Zoran, Between Hitler and Tito. The Disappearance of the Vojvodina Germans, Belgrade 2005 (2nd ed.) and remaining Gakovans were forced to work for two years as indentured slaves throughout Yugoslavia. In the next decades, most emigrated from the country. Memorials to the victims of the Gakovo prison camp have been erected within the town. Since 1944, the village is part of autonomous province Vojvodina, which in 1945 was included into newly formed Socialist Republic of Serbia within new Yugoslavia. Present-day inhabitants of the village were settled here after World War II. None of the inhabitants of Gakovo prior to World War II remain in Gakovo. New settlers originated mostly from Mrkonjić Grad and Donja Pecka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The species has the Phasmid Study Group number PSG9. Range E. tiaratum is native to Queensland and New South Wales but has extralimital distribution as far away as New Guinea. Description male E. tiaratum in fifth instar Female adult E. tiaratum are covered with thorn-like spikes for defense and camouflage. Their long, rounded bodies grow to about 5 to 8 inches (20 cm) long. The females are further described as \\"heavy-bodied, brachypterous and (having) numerous spines and integumental expansions on the face and legs, including a tuft of spines on the conical occiput of the hypognathous head\\". As mentioned, the wings of the female are too small for flying, especially when she is gravid. Exhibiting the sexual dimorphism of many similar insects (particularly other phasmids as well as mantises), males are small and thinner, growing only about 11 cm in length and have three ocelli. Males lack the thorny growths except for spikes around their faces. They have long wings and are good flyers who readily take to the air if disturbed or in search of females. Anti-predator adaptations Threat behaviour Both sexes, when threatened, adopt a threat pose, standing on the front and middle legs, pointing their abdomen up or to the side in a sort of \\"scorpion\\" pose. They fold back their legs to defend themselves if anything comes in contact with their abdomen; the pincer movement with the sharp spines on the rear legs can puncture human skin. Adults make clicking sounds and can release a defensive odor reminiscent of toffee. Males may attempt to startle predators by flashing their wings open. Camouflage E. tiaratum makes use of both passive and active camouflage. It adopts a curved pose when it hangs inverted amongst foliage with \\"its highly procryptic abdomen curled over its back.\\" Individual E. tiaratum vary in color and appear brown, mottled brown, green, reddish, cream, yellowish, or entirely white. Like many stick insects, E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. The swaying behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two. Reproduction nymph in its first instar E. tiaratum at the Frankfurt Zoological Garden E. tiaratum typically reproduce through sexual reproduction and produce eggs that hatch four months later. When no males are present in the population, this stick insect exhibits parthenogenesis instead. Eggs laid without fertilization take up to nine months to hatch and produce only females. In either cases, the female \\"flicks\\" her eggs, swinging her tail, up to several feet to land on the forest floor. These eggs must be kept relatively cool - under 25 °C - or they are unlikely to hatch. The outside material of E. tiaratum eggs consists of lipids and other organic compounds that ants identify as food. They carry these eggs to their colony, consume the edible outer portion, and dump the intact eggs into their waste piles. Luckily for captive breeding, the ants eating the edible outer layer is not crucial to development, so they will hatch just as healthy without the need for any removal of the outer layer, which is not easily visible. Newly hatched E. tiaratum nymphs are ant mimics and resemble the insects in whose nest they are born. Their aposematic pattern—orange head, white collar, the rest black—mimics the ant genus Leptomyrmex and makes them appear toxic. Although most adult stick insects are notoriously slow, these nymphs are speedy, active, and quickly make their way to the trees. Their locomotion slows when they moult into their second and subsequent instars. Females acquire their distinctive spiky appearance through additional moults as well. Extatosoma tiaratum crawling out of his old skin Cultivation Plate 8 from \\"The Monograph of the Genus Phasma\\" by George Robert Gray This species is relatively common in captivity. It is used in laboratories, kept for projects in schools (as is Carausius morosus), and is a popular pet among breeders of exotic insects in North America and Europe. One breeder advises specifically \\"For a stick insect with body length 127mm, to keep 2 adult females, you need a cage at least 600mm high, 300mm deep and 300mm wide.\\" Although the gestation period of their eggs is several months long, they are prolific breeders. A breeder notes that because of this insect's habit of flicking its eggs, one can \\"hear them clicking against the glass\\" of their terraria. Some breeders in the United Kingdom, concerned with the negative effects of inbreeding on the vitality of their stock, have introduced new genes from abroad. Females live to about 18 months old, males to only 6–8 months. Diet E. tiaratum are herbivores and although they thrive on Eucalyptus which is their native food, breeders abroad recommend feeding them bayberry, bramble, hawthorn, oak, photinia, raspberry, rose, and salmon berry (red or yellow) and guava. Although they survive well on non-Eucalypt leaves, they don't always grow as large or retain the same natural colour. Defense E. tiaratum are incapable of bites and stings and rely solely on passive defense and camouflage. Some predators (such as mantids) have good vision, and can see the most camouflaged animals. When threatened, prickly Leaf insect assume an aggressive posture such as rearing up. Females have a tough, spiky exoskeleton while males are winged and can fly away from danger. All adults have glands under that spray a colorless toffee like odor which is pleasant to humans, but deters most predators.

One of his sons, Hayes Davenport, is a television comedy writer and podcaster living in Los Angeles.https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hollywood-handbook-pro- version/e/53783254 His other son, Chase Davenport, makes surfboards and researches artificial intelligence in San Francisco. https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-future-of-ai-will-be-about-less-data-not-more  Analytics 3.0  Writing for the Harvard Business Review, Davenport provides a summary of the three analytics maturity levels of any organization. Analytics 1.0 organizations are those where management has acquired the ability to rely on internal data for decision making, rather than mere intuition. However, these organizations still rely on systems and processes that are inefficient, requiring an extraordinary amount of time to enable analysis to take place. Analytics 2.0 companies combine internal data with externally sourced data, offering predictive capabilities. Davenport notes that this “big data” evolution was predominantly driven by Internet firms with capabilities to work with large amounts of data. According to Davenport, we now find ourselves in the third analytics era where companies of any industry are increasingly “competing on analytics”. The premise is that the many activities an Analytics 3.0 firm might conduct generate data trails that can be collected and subsequently analyzed. These datasets can then be used to create and capture incremental value by providing the necessary input for much more accurate decision making. But more significantly, such analytics capabilities are now a fundamental driver in the creation of increasingly valuable products and services. Indeed, Davenport argues that in many instances analytical power is now built into the product and service itself.

The community's name was originally Shevchenko. The name of the village and the post office was changed to Vita in 1910, because when the railroad came through, the rail-line laying foreman (who was of Italian background) reserved his right to name stations along the line in Italian (though the pronunciation was Anglicized).:uk:Вайта (Манітоба) Vita has a multi-cultural population with residents from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, the largest being Ukrainian and Mennonite.

From 1965 until 1991 the Ukrainian language (in the Canadian Ukrainian dialect) was taught as an option at the elementary and secondary levels – parallel to the French language. Businesses and services in Vita include, but are not limited to: a restaurant, fuel station, hospital, credit union with drive-thru ATM, post office, two grocery stores, an arena-curling rink, a liquor store, and a hotel-motel. Vita is known for its large Canada Day celebration on July 1 of each year. The event generally includes a softball tournament, rodeo, beer gardens, and live entertainment.

An excerpt from the \\"1956 Vitonian Yearbook\\": ;2012 wildfire and winter storm A second disaster struck in early October 2012 when a wildfire swept into Vita, burning four homes and a bridge on PR 201 west of the community – two vehicles attempted to drive over the collapsed structure with slight injuries to the two drivers. The fire began threatening Vita late in the morning and by noon the community was put under warning and the entire community was evacuated. By early evening, the high winds that had put Vita at risk calmed down and the evacuation order was lifted. Greg Selinger, the Manitoba premier at the time, toured the district by helicopter the following day. The community and area saw relief from the fires in the form of an abnormally early winter storm that saw the region receive snowfall of about .

It was discovered on 6 December 1925, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the flowering plant Aquilegia (columbine).  Orbit and classification  Aquilegia is a non-family background asteroid when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. Based on more generic considerations, it has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,286 days; semi-major axis of 2.31 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. First observed as at Heidelberg in May 1906, the body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken in July 1907, more than 18 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Aquilegia has been characterized as an X-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey, which indicates that it is indeed a background asteroid rather than a member of the stony Flora family.  Rotation period  In February 2004, a rotational lightcurve of Aquilegia was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 5.792 hours with a high brightness variation of 0.75 magnitude (), indicative for a non-spherical shape. Previous observations by Richard Binzel in May 1984 gave a similar period of 5.79 hours and an amplitude of 0.93 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Aquilegia measures between 11.288 and 18.93 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.139 and 0.389. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1572 and a diameter of 17.75 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.38.  Naming  This minor planet was named after a genus of flowering plants of the buttercup family, Aquilegia, which is commonly known as \\"columbine\\". The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Reinmuth's flowers  Due to his many discoveries, Karl Reinmuth submitted a large list of 66 newly named asteroids in the early 1930s. The list covered his discoveries with numbers between and . This list also contained a sequence of 28 asteroids, starting with 1054 Forsytia, that were all named after plants, in particular flowering plants (also see list of minor planets named after animals and plants).

It was developed by Victor Interactive Software and was published by Victor in Japan and by NEC in North America. It was released in Japan on and in North America as a TurboGrafx-16 launch title on . In the game, the player controls Gogan, a barbarian whose girl, Flare, was kidnapped by the cult of Jagu. The player must navigate through six platforming levels, armed with a legendary axe named \\"Sting\\" to defeat Jagu and his minions and rescue Flare. The game features a rechargeable \\"strength meter\\" that determines how much damage is dealt from the axe to enemies. The Legendary Axe received high praise and accolades among video game reviewers, and it received positive preview coverage in anticipation with the TurboGrafx-16's launch, showcasing the new console's capabilities. Reviews from gaming magazines such as Electronic Gaming Monthly called it one of the best adventure games seen at the time. It was highly praised for its detailed graphics and animation, diverse music and gameplay, difficulty level, and execution. It won the \\"Best [TurboGrafx-16] Game of the Year\\" and \\"Video Game of the Year\\" (for all consoles) awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly and VideoGames & Computer Entertainment respectively for 1989. The game continued to receive praise from reviewers years after its release for its simple gameplay and game design that showed the performance and capabilities of the TurboGrafx-16. Plot The Legendary Axe takes place in a faraway land, where its inhabitants have been under the control of the cult of Jagu. The cult, who has regularly pillaged the countryside, is led by a half-man half-beast named Jagu. The game's protagonist, Gogan, lives in the village of Minofu, who must hand over one person as a human sacrifice to the Jagu every year. Gogan was away in a remote village studying warfare when he finds out that his childhood friend, Flare, has been selected by the Jagu as their annual sacrifice. Rushing back to Minofu, he finds that she has already been taken by the Jagu to the \\"Evil Place\\" located in the mountains. The village elders hand Gogan the Legendary Axe named \\"Sting\\" which gives him great strength to fight the evil cult. Armed with this axe, he sets off to the Evil Place to defeat Jagu and his cult and rescue Flare.Instruction manual, p. 1. Gameplay The Legendary Axe is a side-scrolling action/platform video game in which the player assumes the role of Gogan,Instruction manual, p. 3. who sets out through six differently-themed levels (called \\"zones\\") including jungles, caves, and mountains; the object is to defeat creatures such as \\"frog men\\", bears, and giant spiders with his Legendary Axe \\"Sting\\"; eliminate Jagu and his cult; and rescue Flare. Players must also navigate obstacles and hazards by jumping. Gogan has a life meter that decreases every time he sustains damage from creatures, and the player loses a life when Gogan's life meter runs out or if he falls off the screen. The game ends when players have lost all their lives, but they get four continues in which they can restart the game at the same section in which they have lost all their lives. Gogan strikes a Nomad with his axe in the midst of a bird and a \\"Jagu idol\\" (containing a power-up) close by. Gogan has a flashing \\"strength meter\\" on the top of the screen that determines how much damage he can inflict on enemies when he swings his axe. The strength meter empties after attacking and then slowly refills back to its maximum. The strength meter increases by 25% whenever the player collects a \\"crystal container\\". This incorporates an element of strategy in the game in which the player can either make a series of weak strikes with the axe or wait and build the strength meter for a single, more powerful strike. Scattered throughout the game to help Gogan are miniature statues called \\"Jagu idols\\" that reveal power-ups when destroyed; these power-ups include \\"crystal containers\\" that increase Gogan's attack strength, wings that increase the speed of Gogan's attacks, power balls that help replenish Gogan's life meter, crystals that award bonus points, and extra lives.Instruction manual, p. 5. Additional lives can also be obtained by earning certain numbers of points.Instruction manual, p. 4. The zones in The Legendary Axe consist of different environments; they range from dark forests to caverns to mountain plateaus to fortresses. Players face many enemies along the way which they need to get through: \\"frog men\\" that leap from the water and spit fire; jumping and rolling amoeba-type creatures in the caverns; \\"rock men\\" that spring out and attack on the mountain plateaus; and giant spiders that shoot webs at players.Instruction manual, pp. 6–7. The bosses in the game are guardians of Jagu's cult and are fought at the end of each zone. They include the following: at the end of Zone 1, a pair of possessed grizzly bears; of Zone 2, a magical boulder; of Zone 3, a group of flying slinky-type monsters called \\"Aqua Lungs\\"; and of Zone 4, a pair of creatures with shields and spears called \\"Punjabbis\\". Zone 5 culminates with a maze of rooms called the \\"Pits of Madness\\" which feature every enemy encountered up to that point plus some new enemies; at its end is a fire-throwing cult demon. Zone 6 consists of the final battle with Jagu himself. Development The Legendary Axe was developed by Victor Interactive Software, and it was released under the title Makyō Densetsu in Japan for the PC Engine by the same company on . Prior to its North American release, the game was retitled The Legendary Axe and was displayed with the other PC Engine games and the console itself at the 1989 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Later in 1989, NEC retooled Hudson Soft's console and renamed it the TurboGrafx-16 for its imminent North American release. NEC sought third-party support to develop the console; since they were purely a hardware developer, they lacked the ability to develop any software or games. This allowed NEC to publish games developed by those supporting third-party companies in North America. The Legendary Axe was released in North America as a launch title for the TurboGrafx-16 on . Sequel On September 7, 1990 Ankoku Densetsu (\\"Legend of Darkness\\"), a game developed by Atlus and Red using the already existing Rastan game matrix, was published in Japan by Victor Interactive Software. Atlus had purchased the developing software usage rights, but not the \\"title\\" product label from Taito. Despite the different title and gameplay mechanics, the game was promoted as a sequel to The Legendary Axe in Japan. When the game was released in North America it was named The Legendary Axe II, even though the titular axe is only an optional weapon in the game. Reception The Legendary Axe received positive coverage upon its release. In an overview of the PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as \\"characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play\\". A later preview from the same magazine said that it was one of the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an \\"excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities\\". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad said it \\"is how [a platform game] should have been done\\" and that it should be the first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it \\"is everything you could want in a game\\". The Legendary Axe received several awards and accolades. In Electronic Gaming Monthlys \\"Best and Worst of 1989\\", the game won \\"Best Game of the Year\\" honors for the TurboGrafx-16. The magazine cited a \\"perfect blend of action and adventure\\" and outstanding graphics and sound. It also received an award for \\"Coolest Boss Attackers\\" for its final boss Jagu – an award that was shared with 1989 Sega Genesis \\"Best Game of the Year\\" Ghouls 'n Ghosts for its final boss \\"Loki\\". The game won \\"Video Game of the Year\\" (for all consoles) honors from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in 1989. They said that the game \\"has a little of everything: loads of axe-swinging action, layer upon layer of high-quality music and smooth, colorful animation. The combination of these elements brought this action adventure to the top of the video-game heap like rising cream.\\" The Legendary Axe continued to receive praise from reviewers years after its release. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly editors ranked it number 80 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", attributing the game's popularity to its huge levels, \\"dead-on control\\", intelligently designed charge mechanic, and huge bosses, particularly the final boss. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.In his overview of the TurboGrafx-16's history, IGN's Levi Buchanan pointed out that the game made the console \\"an easy sell\\" for buyers and showed the superior performance of the TurboGrafx-16 over the Nintendo Entertainment System. He said that The Legendary Axe \\"made the NES look downright ancient\\". In a separate full review of the game, Buchanan noted that the game was an improvement over the console's pack-in game Keith Courage in Alpha Zones; he said that The Legendary Axe was more fun and had good action compared to the former. He noted that the game remained enjoyable almost 20 years after its release because of its simple platforming gameplay compared to more complicated modern video games like Mass Effect. He praised the game's smooth animation, innovative and detailed backgrounds, enemy designs, and soundtrack – saying that \\"any classic game tune nerd would enjoy having [the music] on their iPod\\". Allgame noted a change in the gameplay near the end of the game; after the fifth level, players must navigate a maze called the \\"Pits of Madness\\" which if they take the wrong path, they get sent back to its beginning. The Legendary Axe was not released for the Wii's Virtual Console service, and IGN's Lucas Thomas rated the game as the 3rd best in a list of \\"Top 10 unreleased TurboGrafx Titles\\" for the system. He said that he was shocked to find that this game was not on the Virtual Console, given that it was one of the TurboGrafx-16's flagship titles that were heavily advertised when it was released. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer, in a look back to video gaming in January 1989, made a similar comparison of the game to Rastan, \\"with a lot of sword slashing and platform jumping\\". The reviewer said that the popularity of The Legendary Axe in Japan was what caused it to be released as a TurboGrafx-16 launch title in North America.

In contrast, Computer and Video Games called it \\"a great sequel, and a brilliant hack 'n slash in its own right.\\" The reviewer applauded the atmospheric backdrops, ambient sounds, and strong difficulty curve. GamePro likewise felt it to be a satisfying sequel, concluding, \\"Remember, you axed for it!\\" in allusion to the heavy fan outcry for a Legendary Axe sequel.

Early life Aloysius was born to John and Bridget O'Kelly in Peterson's Lane, Dublin 3 July 1853. He was the youngest of four boys and one girl. The O'Kelly family along with Aloysius' cousins, the Lawlors, made up a network of artists and political activists in 19th-century Irish cultural history. His grandparents on his father's side were natives of County Roscommon and his father ran a blacksmith's shop and dray making business in Peterson's Lane.O'Sullivan, N., Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire, Field Day Publications, 2010, p. 2 His uncle on his mother's side was John Lawlor, a successful sculptor, and his cousin, Michael Lawlor, was also a sculptor employed in London. Aloysius' brothers, Charles and Stephen, also became artists, whereas the eldest brother, James J. O'Kelly, set forth on a successful political career. O'Kelly's mother directed him towards a career in the arts. In 1861, John's father died and Briget, whose brother, John Lawlor (1820-1901) was already an established sculptor in London. moved her family there. Lawlor became a father figure to her children, especially her sons. Lawlor took on the boys, including Aloysius, as apprentices in his studio.O'Sullivan, N., Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire, Field Day Publications, 2010, pp 6-8 Career Mass in a Connemara Cabin by Aloysius O'Kelly, 1883 O'Kelly traveled to Paris in order to enroll at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1874, where he studied under Bonnat and Gérôme. To enter the Gérôme's atelier was a great honour, however, the master was exceedingly strict and merciless in his criticism; such that a number of students could not last the distance. It is uncertain whether O'Kelly ever matriculated.O'Sullivan, N., Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire, 2010, pp 17-22 From Gérôme, O'Kelly developed an interest in Oriental scenes. He traveled to Brittany in 1876 painting its aesthetic coastlines, fishing ports and villages. In October 1881, Charles Stewart Parnell, a member of Parliament and leader of the Irish Party, was arrested and imprisoned in Kilmainham. Two days following his arrest, Aloysius' brother, James J. O'Kelly, along with some other Party members, including John Dillon, were imprisoned where they remained until May 1882. A number of Aloysius' drawings during this period portrayed the political situation dealing with his brother's incarceration.Byrne, Coleman, King: Ireland and the Americas, 2008, p. 720 Aloysius inevitably became embroiled in the murky and often secretive life of his brother. He began to paint and sketch political activists including members of the Land League. O'Kelly lived in Concarneau, Connemara and eventually the United States, painting rural scenes in the prior and city life in New York City. Aloysius O'Kelly. Milmo-Penny Fine Art.

He was the grandson of the king Machunda from the Silanga clan of the island of Ukerewe in the lake Victoria. In 1945, he wrote the famous novel Myombekere na Bugonoka na Ntulanalwo na Bulihwali in his native language, Kikerewe. Life In 1901 when Kitereza was a young boy of five, his father died of smallpox. Kitereza and his mother then went to live at the court of the Omukama. Mukaka, who brought up Kitereza as one of his own children. Determined to learn the secrets of white man's power and knowledge, Mukaka sent his sons and the sons of his close relatives to study with white missionaries at the Roman Catholic Mission School in nearby Kagunguli village. In contrast, other kings and traditional rulers elsewhere in the colony sent the sons of their slaves and servants to school in place of their own sons to avoid the contamination of the white man's religion and education. Kitereza began schooling at Kagunguli Mission in 1905. There he was baptized and given the Christian name of Aniceti. Two years later, in 1907, King Mukaka died and was succeeded by his son Ruhumbika who encouraged Kitereza to leave Kagunguli in 1909 to pursue further schooling at the Rubya Roman Catholic Seminary in today's Kagera Region near the Ugandan border. Kitereza studied at the Rubya Seminary for ten years advancing to senior seminary and mastering Latin, the medium of instruction in Roman Catholic seminaries. He learned Greek, a requirement of the classical education of the seminary as well as German, the language of the colonial masters. Kitereza also learned Swahili, the African language used as the lingua franca by Arab traders, slavers, and the coastal middlemen. Kitereza also learned English after German defeat in the World War I. In addition to the languages, he studied theology and philosophy as part of his Roman Catholic priesthood training.

History Andover High School, originally named Bloomfield Hills High School, opened in the fall of 1931. It presided on Vaughan Road, built on land donated to the district by George Gough Booth. In 1936, Bloomfield Hills High School had its first graduating class of only eight students. Due to the expanding population growth in the area, a larger school was necessary. This came into fruition in 1955 when Bloomfield Hills High School moved to its new location on Andover Road. However, sizing again became a problem, only this time a new school was built. In 1967, Lahser High School opened, and the era of Andover finally commenced. In 2015 it was rebuilt as the new Bloomfield Hills High School. Academics Over 98% of Andover's graduates attended college after graduation, and the actual graduation rate was about 97%. Average SAT scores for Andover were (1233/1600), above the national average. Two Andover alumni won the Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, in the UK. Wen Shi (Johns Hopkins University) won the award in 2003, and Abdul El-Sayed (University of Michigan) won it in 2008.

This logo has been used from 2002 to 2009. BLUF (Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub) is an international fraternal organization of gay men and MSM sharing a fetishistic interest in leather breeches and uniforms. The leather breeches are worn inside tall leather boots known as jackboots. BLUF is a part of a larger leather subculture and the sexual aesthetic is similar to the exaggerated masculinity seen in the work of Tom of Finland. Members share interest in leather fetishism, boot fetishism, and uniform fetishism. Some wear leather uniforms reminiscent of German World War II era uniforms, but without the Nazi regalia or embracement of NSDAP politics. The other common uniforms worn are those of American style police motorcycle patrol and German police.  Dress code and guidelines  Membership is open to men of all races and nationalities above the age of consent in members' home countries. In order to join the club, the applicants are required to respect a strict dress code and a set of guidelines explained on the club's official website: BLUF Dresscode. Any breach of the requirements listed will result in a rejection of the photo and therefore of the application. Once the application is accepted, the member is assigned a random number that identifies him among the other members.  History  BLUF began as an Internet site in 1997 from Montreal, Canada but has evolved to a series of in-person meets and events regularly scheduled in European and North American cities. Members frequently plan vacation time around, and travel to, international meetings. A majority of members live in northern Europe, primarily Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden, but members are found in North America, Asia, Central America, South America and Africa. BLUF started in October 1997 as a simple HTML-based website for men into full leather uniforms. According to the founder, \\"I was living in Montreal then and I had just discovered the joys of Internet. I joined Leather Navigator, which at that time was the only internet platform for leather men. Being disappointed with the absence of any kind of dress code, I started BLUF. I contacted a few friends by email, sent postcards to others (not everybody had a computer in those days), and informed them about the new club. Some of them joined. At the beginning, almost all new members were American. I had met quite a few at parties in Canada and the U.S. Not many Europeans had internet access then. The site consisted in those days of a picture gallery, a list of members, a list of admirers (for those that couldn't meet the dress code requirements), an online magazine and (a little later) a forum. Access was free. The cost of the server was covered by me. I was the webmaster and maintained the site. BLUF 3 went online in December 2009, with the ability to send messages between members and upload photos directly. In 2012, during the 15th anniversary year. the organization reached 3,000 members. On Sunday 20t January 2013, during Belgium's Leather Pride, BLUF won the X Award for Fetish Organisation 2013. References * Hooven, F, Valentine. Tom of Finland, His Life and Times.

The organization is credited to be one of the first fair trade initiatives worldwide, with imports as early as 1949. In 2006, it was one of the country's largest fair trade importers with annual sales of approximately $10 million. It currently works with 85 small-scale, cooperatively run producer groups in 35 countries.SERRV International (2005). 2005 Annual Report. URL accessed on December 11, 2006. The organization's mission is to \\"promote the social and economic progress of people in developing regions of the world by marketing their products in a just and direct manner\\". SERRV International was funded and supported in 2005 by the Calvert Foundation, Catholic Relief Services, the Idyll Foundation and MMA Community Development Investments, Inc. The organization is a founding member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) and the Fair Trade Federation. It follows the internationally recognized fair trade principles of fair wage, gender equality, long-term relationships, concern for the environment, democratic decision making, safe working conditions, respect for culture, and prohibition of child exploitation.  History  SERRV International was launched in 1949. It began as a program of the Church of the Brethren as a way to help refugees in Europe recover economically and socially from World War II. The name SERRV is an acronym for Sales Exchange for Refugee Rehabilitation and Vocation. It first imported wooden cuckoo clocks from Germany to Maryland to sell in the U.S. The program grew from assisting World War II refugees to working with impoverished people throughout the world. SERRV began importing handicrafts from the world's least developed countries as a way to alleviate poverty. By 1960, with the help of Church World Service, a nationwide network of churches were selling SERRV crafts as part of their mission work. In 1964, the first full-time director was hired and three staff members were appointed. In 1999, SERRV International split from the Church of the Brethren to become an independent 501(c)(3) organization. Sales at this time had reached more than $5.5 million and the product line branched out into fair trade coffee and chocolate as well as handicrafts. SERRV became the U.S. distributor of Fair Trade Divine Chocolate, the first farmer-owned chocolate company in the world. In 2001, in addition to marketing fair trade products, the organization stepped up its efforts as a development organization. Its current development projects with artisans and farmers include skill training workshops, product design assistance, and small grants, all largely funded by charitable contributions to SERRV from individuals, foundations, and churches. In 2004, the organization launched a new marketing identity called A Greater Gift, which represents its catalog and retail business. Shortly afterward, SERRV also launched EQUO Foods, its own fair trade foods brand. In the fall of 2008 SERRV dropped the identity of A Greater Gift and started using SERRV once again. The 2008 catalog had many new changes in style, layout and content. Divine USA also introduced new chocolate products in the fall of 2008.SERRV International (2006). About Us.

The film stars Ilmari Saarelainen as James Bond impersonator Joonas G. Breitenfeldt (Agent 000) and Tenho Saurén as a bank robber. English actor John Wood also makes an appearance as Agent 009, and his serious, wooden portrayal of the character stands in contrast to the outrageous antics of the other members of the cast contributing to further humour. Finnish actress Kielo Tommila stars as the reporter Ulla Salla and the main love interest of Agent 000. \\"000\\" or \\"nolla-nolla-nolla\\" as it was advertised, was then the Finnish national emergency call number. Plot Very much the typical spoof the film includes all the typical elements of the James Bond films, an evil genius villain, car chases, helicopters, gadgets and beautiful women. The film involves a hazardous health clinic, the archetype villain's secret, console- crowded headquarters, as Agent 000 (Saarelainen) attempts to stop the masked villain's organisation (a spoof of SPECTRE) from turning the members of Finnish establishment into nudists, drunks or suicide candidates with a mind- control device. The parody content of the film is similar to that of Casino Royale (1967 film) starring David Niven and Peter Sellers. Release The film premiered on 16 September 1983. It was produced by the Finnish film company Tuotanto Visa Mäkinen and was distributed by Kinosto. The company produced a number of other popular Finnish films in the 1980s and early 1990s such as Pirtua, Pirtua in 1991. The rights to the film are owned by director Visa Mäkinen. The cinema version of the film had a running time of 89 minutes although the uncut version released on VHS in 1984 ran 4 minutes longer at 92 minutes. Initially for the big screen, Agentti 000 ja kuoleman kurvit was awarded the Finland:S certificate but the uncut video version was given a Finland:K-12 labelling.

Early life and education Dr. Tooth was born on 22 April 1856 to Frederick Tooth of Hove, Sussex, England. He attended Rugby School and from there attended St John's College, Cambridge. In 1877, he graduated Bachelor of Arts and achieved Master of Arts in 1881. After his university education, Howard Henry Tooth studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, achieving his MD in 1885.The British Medical Journal May 23 1925 Career He became Physician to the London Metropolitan Hospital in 1887. He was also appointed Assistant Physician in the same year at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic and promoted to full Physician in 1907. He was also an assistant Physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1895 and full Physician in 1906. In 1894 taught a post-graduate course on Cranial Nerves at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.The British Medical Journal May 12 1894 He was awarded CMG in 1901 and CB in 1918. Military service Dr. Tooth spent quite a period of time in the military, resulting in him being awarded the rank of Colonel. During the Boer War, Dr. Tooth was stationed in South Africa. Over the period of World War I he spent time both in London and as a consulting physician to the troops in Malta and consultant to the British forces in Italy. His services during this time resulted in his name being twice mentioned in dispatches. Civic participation Howard Henry Tooth was a member of the Pathological Society of London. In 1894, he served as a council member to that society. Personal life Dr. Tooth's first marriage was to Mary Beatrice Price, by whom he had one daughter. With his second wife, Helen Katherine Chilver, he had two sons and one daughter. He died at home in Hadleigh, Suffolk after a cerebral hemorrhage.

It was established in 1902 and specializes in the promotion of women in the sciences, especially chemistry. It also focuses on personal and professional growth for women in these fields. As with all honor societies, they create professional networks along with recognizing achievements of women in chemistry. History The society was formed during a period when women gained little recognition for their work. Therefore, women began to set up their own awards to highlight their abilities on their resumes. The national society was formed in 1902 by Agnes Faye Morgan. She was appointed department chair of the Department of Household Science and Arts at the University of California and was one of the first to integrate chemistry into the curriculum of home economics. She continued to participate in the society throughout her professional life and had a particular focus on research. She also founded a local honour society for women in home economics named Alpha Nu. The society goals were to encourage women to pursue chemistry academically, to \\"stimulate personal accomplishment in chemical fields\\" and to promote the academic, business and social lives of its members. Early chapters opened at the University of Washington around 1910 and continued to spread across the country, and eventually held meetings for the American Chemical Society. In the 1930s, there was an offer of amalgamation from the Phi Lambda Upsilon honor society for male chemists but this was refused.  Professional awards  The highest award from the society is the National Honorary Member which is given to female chemists who have made an exceptional and significant achievement in the field. The certificate is awarded with a prize fund of USD1500. Some of the previous winners include: Marie Sklodowska-Curie, Gerti Cori and Dorothy Hodgkin. The Violet Diller Professional Excellence Award, named after a previous member (treasurer and president), is awarded for \\"accomplishments in academic, governmental, or industrial chemistry, in education, in administration, or in a combination of these areas\\". The award consists of a certificate and USD1000 prize fund. This award was first awarded to Joan P. Lambros in 1984. The Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award is given to women who have achieved in the field of chemistry or biochemistry. The Centennial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching is given to those who have excelled in teaching chemistry, biochemistry or a similar subject. The nominee must spend at least 75% of their time teaching undergraduates to qualify for the certificate and USD500 award.  Student awards  The Anna Louise Hoffman Award for Outstanding Achievement in Graduate Research is given to the nominee that has demonstrated outstanding chemical research. The nominee must also be a full-time graduate student to get the certification and US$500 reward. There are two awards for Undergraduate Excellence in Chemistry; one must go to a first-generation student. Again, the reward is a certificate and US$500. The Gladys Anderson Emerson Undergraduate Scholarship is funded from Emerson's estate. She wished for the funding to be given to female Iota Sigma Pi members who are undergraduates in chemistry or biochemistry. The scholarship consists of a US$2000 stipend and a certificate. The Members-at- Large Re-entry Award is for those who have been away from academic study for over three years and then returned to degree-level chemistry. This is awarded with a US$1500 cash prize and a certificate of recognition. Aimed at high school students, the Outstanding Young Women in Chemistry is an award given to those who demonstrate high academic ability in chemistry.

Nave of the Basilica of St. John Lateran Camillo Rusconi (14 July 1658 – 8 December 1728) was an Italian sculptor of the late Baroque in Rome. His style displays both features of Baroque and Neoclassicism. He has been described as a Carlo Maratta in marble. Biography Initially trained in his hometown of Milan with Giuseppe Rusnati. By 1685-1686, he had moved to Rome and into the studio of Ercole Ferrata, who died within a year or two of his arrival. Rusconi's talent attracted commissions, for example, for plaster allegorical statues depicting four virtues (prudence, justice, temperance, and strength) for the Ludovisi chapel in the church of Sant'Ignazio. He then worked alongside Le Gros in sculpting angels for the tympanum of the altar of Saint Ignatius at the Church of the Gesù. Camillo’s masterpieces are the four larger-than-life apostles (Matthew, James the Great, Andrew, and John) completed during 1708-1718 for the niches of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran (San Giovanni in Laterano). This sculptural program was the major such project in the Rome of his day. The other main sculptors for the project, Le Gros and Pierre-Etienne Monnot, each only garnered two apostles. Pope Clement XI had established a committee to select the artists, and included Carlo Fontana and Rusconi's friend, Carlo Maratta, in the panel. The classical restraint of the figures was to set a trend toward neoclassicism. Other works include some of the architectural decoration for San Silvestro in Capite, San Salvatore in Lauro, and for the Chiesa Nuova (Santa Maria in Vallicella). He also completed the tomb of Pope Gregory XIII (1715–1723) for the St. Peter's; the tomb of Bartolomeo Corsino in San Giovanni in Laterano, and of the principe Alessandro Sobieski in the church of Santa Maria della Concezione. He also complete the portrait of Giulia Albani degli Olivieri, the powerful aunt of Clement XI, (presently in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). His tomb for Caesar Fabretti (? -1700) is on the first pillar to the left in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Among his pupils were Pietro Bracci, Giovanni Battista Maini, and Filippo della Valle. In 1727, he was named principe of the Accademia di San Luca.

Especially well known in peanuts, peas, and pansy this behavior is most widespread in the grass family. However, the largest genus of cleistogamous plants is Viola. The more common opposite of cleistogamy, or \\"closed marriage\\", is called chasmogamy, or \\"open marriage\\". Virtually all plants that produce cleistogamous flowers also produce chasmogamous ones.Meeuse, Bastiaan and Sean Morris. 1984. The sex life of flowers. New York, NY: Facts on File Publishers. pp 110-111. The principal advantage of cleistogamy is that it requires fewer plant resources to produce seeds than does chasmogamy, because development of petals, nectar and large amounts of pollen is not required. This efficiency makes cleistogamy particularly useful for seed production on unfavorable sites or adverse conditions. Impatiens capensis, for example, has been observed to produce only cleistogamous flowers after being severely damaged by grazing and to maintain populations on unfavorable sites with only cleistogamous flowers. The obvious disadvantage of cleistogamy is that self-fertilization occurs, which may suppress the creation of genetically superior plants. For genetically modified (GM) rapeseed, researchers hoping to minimise the admixture of GM and non-GM crops are attempting to use cleistogamy to prevent gene flow. However, preliminary results from Co-Extra, a current project within the EU research program, show that although cleistogamy reduces gene flow, it is not at the moment a consistently reliable tool for biocontainment; due to a certain instability of the cleistogamous trait, some flowers may open and release genetically modified pollen.

They both believed in individual human rights and the rule of law which were trampled by the communist revolution. This influenced Djurdje in his belief that for Serbia to move forward it was first necessary to fully dismantle the legacy of the communist dictatorship.British Library Catalogue Article \\"Remembering the beginnings of the (re-established) Democratic Party\\", SOUTH SLAV JOURNAL, 2006, VOL 27; NUMB 3/4, pages 62-71 He graduated from Belgrade Law School in 1964 and completed post-graduate studies at the University of London in 1968.

In 1990 he was also a founding Director of the Democratic Party opposition newspaper Demokratija.“AP Article on Demokratija newspaper and D Ninkovic” He left the DS with the pro-DEPOS coalition wing of the party and was a founding member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) in July 1992 with Vojislav Koštunica, Vladeta Janković, Mirko Petrović, Draško Petrović, Vladan Batić and others. Initially, for the first few months, the administrative central office of the DSS was also located in his law offices in hotel Astoria. He was elected to the DSS' General Committee at the founding party conference.Interview with Vladan Batic, Minister of Justice of Serbia about history of founding of DS and DSS (in Serbian) Both within the DS and DSS he was concerned with establishing a democratic system in Serbia premised on the rule of law with a strong independent judiciary and a government of just laws. He campaigned for the adoption of four specific essential laws to achieve a moral, political and economic break with the totalitarian past which would also underpin the establishment of society based on democratic values and respect for individual human rights. The four laws are: the Law of restitution of property forcibly nationalised by the communist regime without compensation; the Law of privatisation; the Law of rehabilitation of political prisoners; and the Law of lustration, effectively barring those individuals who had been instrumental in the abuse of human rights under communism from holding public office for a period of years. His published view was that society, by adopting these laws, would also make a moral statement that totalitarian policies had failed and had been deeply unjust and would make a best attempt to right the wrongs perpetrated over more than 50 years of communist rule and establish a free market economy allowing individuals rather than the state to control economic resources.A similar approach to transition from Communism to Democracy had been recommended by the Council of Europe in 1996 in its Resolution 1096 on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems.

He also campaigned for the adoption of legislation on lustration of communist apparatchiks especially within the government, judiciary and the police (such laws having been adopted in post-communist countries including Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary).A law on the \\"Responsibility of individuals for breaches of human rights\\", the so called \\"law of lustration\\", was passed by the Serbian parliament in 2003 but has not been applied to investigate Milosevic era and Communist era abuses by the Serbian judiciary and police. Since 2006 he is no longer involved in party politics having experienced a continuing lack of political will for genuine deep rooted political reforms. In 2009 he actively campaigned for the immediate adoption of a just Law of restitution of nationalised and confiscated property, which is a condition of Serbia's potential membership of the EU. His campaign included a direct action occupation of hotel Astoria which had been built by his grandfather, Djurdje S.

Pratt (born November 13, 1942) is the executive director emeritus of Gun Owners of America, a United States-based firearms lobbying group, and a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates.  Early life  Pratt was born in Camden, New Jersey on November 13, 1942. His father was an electrical engineer. Several years after graduating from American University with a degree in political science, Pratt took the helm of Gun Owners of America in 1976, one year after the organization was founded.  Political career  Pratt was elected to the state legislature of Virginia, as a Republican member of the 1981 session of the Virginia House of Delegates, elected from the 19th District in Fairfax County. He was also a Reagan delegate to the 1980 Republican National Convention. In October 1992, at Estes Park, Colorado, Pratt was noted as a moderate conservative presenter at a three-day meeting organized by Christian Identity pastor Pete Peters in the wake of the Ruby Ridge incident.Frederick Clarkson, Eternal Hostility (Common Courage Press: Monroe, Maine, 1997), p. 21.Leonard Zeskind, \\"Armed and Dangerous\\", Rolling Stone; November 2, 1995. In the 1996 U.S. presidential election, Pratt served as a co-chairman of Pat Buchanan's campaign. In February 1996, the liberal Center for Public Integrity issued a report that claimed Pratt spoke at meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. As a result, Pratt resigned his position with the Buchanan campaign. In a Rolling Stone Magazine article, Larry Pratt is quoted defending his decision to speak to white supremacy groups. \\"I myself would also talk to white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups. I talk to liberal groups, but people don't accuse me of being liberal. I wash all that off at home. It's important to talk to anyone who will listen.\\" Pratt also addressed delegates at the 1996 national convention of the U.S. Taxpayers PartyShasha Abramsky, \\"'When God laughs, it's not funny,' the U.S. Taxpayers Party prepares for doomsday\\" , The Progressive; October 1996. (renamed the Constitution Party in 1999). In Northern Ireland in 2004, Pratt accompanied loyalist and paramilitary sympathizer Willie Frazer on a tour of South Armagh whilst calling for the Protestant population to be routinely armed.  Political organizations  Pratt has founded a variety of organizations, including English First (lobbying organization), Gun Owners of America, U.S. Border Control, and Committee to Protect the Family. Pratt is the president of English First, an organization within the English-only movement.Elain Shannon, et al., \\"John Ashcroft's Dubious Pen Pal\\", TIME; Thursday, Jan 11, 2001. The organization was founded in 1986, and works to pass English Only amendments at both state and federal levels. Pratt also helped found and served as secretary of the Council for Inter-American Security, which was founded in 1976. Pratt has served as a board member of the American Legislative Exchange Council. Pratt has also been listed as a member of the Council for National Policy (CNP). A January 13, 2001 article in The Guardian explored Pratt's relationship with then-Attorney General nominee John Ashcroft, stating they knew each other from the CNP. The January 11, 2001 edition of TIME Magazine included an article on Pratt and Ashcroft's relationship. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pratt used his Committee to Protect the Family organization to raise $150,000 for the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue which paid $50,000 in court-imposed fines.  Radio and television appearances  Pratt has appeared on numerous national radio and TV programs such as the Today Show, Good Morning America, The Political Cesspool, Crossfire, Larry King Live, Hannity & Colmes, Piers Morgan Live and The Phil Donahue Show. In reference to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Pratt declared that Martin was at fault for not running away after knocking down George Zimmerman, who was following Trayvon under suspicion \\"[Martin] should have run away,\\" Pratt said. \\"He had his stalker on the ground. Once Martin had neutralized the threat, that's when he should have taken off to get out of there. He doubled down, and he started to really beat the tar out of the guy.\\" Pratt also noted that Martin was on top of Zimmerman after Zimmerman tried to make a \\"citizen's arrest\\" of Martin. The day after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Pratt stated: \\"Gun control supporters have the blood of little children on their hands. Federal and state laws combined to ensure that no teacher, no administrator, no adult had a gun at the Newtown school where the children were murdered. This tragedy underscores the urgency of getting rid of gun bans in school zones. The only thing accomplished by gun free zones is to ensure that mass murderers can slay more before they are finally confronted by someone with a gun.\\" In May 2016, Pratt suggested that the loss of a conservative majority in the Supreme Court through a Democratic victory in the 2016 Presidential elections might lead him and other gun owners to use violence in order to resist any judicial ruling supporting gun control, saying 'we may have to reassert that proper constitutional balance, and it may not be pretty. So, I’d much rather have an election where we solve this matter at the ballot box than have to resort to the bullet box.'http://podcast.gcnlive.com/gunOwnersNews/052816.mp3 In 2018, a segment with Pratt aired as part of Sacha Baron Cohen's Showtime series, Who is America?. Pratt endorses “Kinderguardians,” a fake program to teach and arm schoolchildren as young as 3 to protect themselves in the classroom. In the segment, he can also be heard laughing at jokes made by Baron Cohen about shooting a praying Muslim man as well as marital rape. Pratt was also quoted as saying \\"Children under five also have elevated levels of the pheromone Blink-182, produced by the part of the liver known as the Rita Ora. This allows nerve reflexes to travel along the Cardi B neural pathway to the Wiz Khalifa 40% faster, saving time and saving lives.”  Books  * Armed People Victorious (1990). * Safeguarding Liberty: The Constitution and Citizen Militias (1995). * On the Firing Line: Essays in the Defense of Liberty (2001).

The film also marks the first new appearance of Herbie in 15 years, following Herbie's television series Herbie, the Love Bug, which ran for five episodes. Plot The narrator, (Dean Jones as Jim Douglas), unfolds the story of Herbie the Volkswagen Beetle. Herbie was owned by an egotistic racing driver and car dealer named Simon Moore III (John Hannah). Due to his arrogance, he did not treat Herbie very well. During a race, Simon Moore III called Herbie junk, which caused Herbie to rebel against his owner. They ended up in last place for the race. Simon was not pleased and he threw out Herbie in a junkyard. Hank Cooper (Bruce Campbell), a small-town mechanic who works in a local garage, enters a junk-car race where drivers select a jalopy and attempt to start and race it. Hank ends up getting \\"last choice\\" and is forced to choose the only car left, a broken-down Herbie. Assisted by his \\"spiritually enlightened\\" but goofy friend Roddy, Hank manages to get Herbie started just before he is towed off the track. In appreciation for his kindness to the little VW, Herbie manages to win the race, trouncing such junkers as a Cadillac limousine and an early-model Corvair Monza convertible. The judges of the race, Donny Shotz (Micky Dolenz), Alex (Alexandra Wentworth), whom Hank used to date; and Simon, find it hard to believe that such a tiny car could run so fast, and Alex challenges Hank to prove that he didn't try any tricks during the race in order to win. Hank takes Alex for a ride, showing Herbie's speed, and their relationship is re-kindled (with Herbie driving them to an isolated area and locking his doors, as he did with Jim Douglas and Carol Bennett in the first movie). Meanwhile, Roddy tells Hank that Herbie is special, and takes him to an automotive art show. At the show, Simon sees Herbie and attempts to discover why his car, which failed him, took Hank to victory. He discovers that Herbie was built by Dr. Gustav Stumpfel (Harold Gould) shortly after World War II. He asked Dr. Gustav to create another car, but he wants the car to be pure evil and black. He ends up naming the second car \\"Horace the Hate Bug,\\" using the \\"magical ingredients\\" of a picture of Simon, along with Herbie's key. Simon orders Horace to find Herbie and destroy him, which Horace does, leaving Herbie a heap of crushed metal. Hank catches up with Herbie, but finds it's too late to save him, and Hank, Roddy, and Alex give Herbie a funeral. At the funeral, Herbie's former owner Jim Douglas arrives, with Dr. Stumpfel, and after examining Herbie's remains, informs them that he can be rebuilt, provided they use all of Herbie's original sheet metal. Hank gets Donny Shotz, an auto customizer, to re-shape and paint Herbie's sheet metal. Hank, Roddy, Alex, and Jim work to rebuild Herbie, and when finished, Hank gives Jim the honor of trying to start him. Herbie starts on the first try, and sounds his horn, letting them know that he's the same car that they have come to know and love. Meanwhile, Simon challenges Hank to a race between Horace and Herbie. Although Simon makes every attempt to sabotage the race, Herbie manages to win (cut in half by Horace's laser). Furious, Horace tries to destroy Herbie again by ramming him off a cliff, but ends up falling into the ravine himself. Simon and his partner Rupert are then arrested for illegally detonating explosives, driving an unregistered \\"devil car,\\" and illegally dumping said car. The film ends with Hank and Alex, in love again, driving off in Herbie after finishing up on a magazine article about Herbie.

Music career Influences and early career Robert Gordon grew up in Bethesda, Maryland. At the age of nine, he was greatly inspired by the Elvis Presley song \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" playing on radio and decided to pursue a career as a Rock & Roll musician at that young age.Deelen, Arjan: \\"Look Who's Blue – The Robert Gordon Story\\", Now Dig This No. 254, May 2004. His influences included Gene Vincent, Jack Scott, Billy Lee Riley, Eddie Cochran and other notable rock 'n roll music artists of the period. He made his recording debut at age 17 in 1964 with a group called the Confidentials. The Confidentials, with Robert (called Bob at the time) as the singer, recorded the songs \\"Summertime,\\" \\"Money,\\" and \\"There is Something on Your Mind,\\" among others on acetate phonograph discs. When asked how he related to the 1960s, Robert replied \\"I didn't.\\" He didn't care much for the British Invasion but he identified with soul singers such as James Brown and Otis Redding whom he saw, among other great R&B; acts, performing at Washington DC's famous Howard Theatre. During the turbulent times of the late 1960s, with the rioting and antiwar protests of the period, Robert served in the National Guard in Washington, D.C. \\"I didn't want to be sent to Vietnam,\\" he recalls. Punk rock Gordon moved to New York City in 1970 and a few years later joined a punk rock band there known as the Tuff Darts. During 1976, the Tuff Darts recorded \\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\", \\"Head over Heels\\", and \\"Slash\\" for a compilation album called Live at CBGB's, which included a number of other local New York City bands. That same year, Robert appeared in a punk/New Wave style film entitled Unmade Beds, an homage to Jean-Luc Godard by underground filmmaker Amos Poe. Blondie lead singer Deborah Harry also appeared in the film. Rockabilly revival Gordon on tour with Chris Spedding in Japan, 2006 Record producer Richard Gottehrer discovered Robert during a rehearsal one afternoon with the Tuff Darts and soon afterward the two were talking about making a rock and roll record. Gottehrer was impressed with Gordon's baritone voice and his rendition of Elvis Presley's \\"One Night\\". After some conversation, Robert suggested working with guitar legend Link Wray. Wray was contacted and he agreed to work with them both. \\"Robert to me sounds a lot like the early Elvis, back when he was at Sun Records,\\" Wray would comment. In 1977 Robert Gordon with Link Wray on Private Stock Records was the result of this collaboration. Due to Elvis Presley's death, the album picked up some airplay, and the label Private Stock tried to hype Gordon as the heir to Elvis. In 1978, Gordon made a second album with Wray, on the Private Stock label, called Fresh Fish Special. The record featured The Jordanaires, who had been background vocalists for Presley, and included the Bruce Springsteen song \\"Fire\\". Springsteen played keyboards on the track. An advertisement in the March 11, 1978 edition of Billboard magazine read, in part: \\"Robert Gordon, the new voice of Rock and Roll, and Link Wray, the legendary guitarist, are together again! FRESH FISH SPECIAL follows their red hot first album – and it's a killer! Bruce Springsteen wrote a song for it. Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and Jack Scott are faithfully remembered in it.\\" In late 1978, RCA records signed Gordon to a contract which he described as \\"a dream come true\\" to be on \\"Elvis' label\\". In February 1979 Rock Billy Boogie was released, this time without Wray, as Chris Spedding joined Gordon, playing lead guitar. Writer Bruce Eder (AllMusicGuide) hailed Gordon's next album Bad Boy, released in 1980, as one of the best mature rockabilly albums ever recorded. The next and last album for RCA was 1981's Are You Gonna Be The One. The title track written by Marc Jonson. It is Gordon's best selling album to date, with more than 200,000 copies sold. Danny Gatton played lead guitar on this record and Marshall Crenshaw penned the single \\"Someday, Someway\\" which went to No. 76 on the Billboard charts in 1981. During the early 1980s, Gordon toured briefly with Gatton. A recording of one of their performances was later released on NRG Records as The Humbler. Reunion Gordon performing live in Denmark, 2007 In 2005, after years of not working together, Gordon and guitar player Chris Spedding reconnected and toured Europe. Highlights from the shows in Denmark, Sweden and Finland were released on The Reunion Tour, on their own Climate Control label. The French label, Last Call released a DVD from the Amsterdam concert, entitled Rockin' The Paradiso. They also recorded an album of 15 Elvis songs with the Jordanaires for the 30th anniversary of Elvis' death, entitled It's Now Or Never, released on the Rykodisc label. In 2009 and 2010 Gordon toured with an all-star line-up \\"The Gang They Couldn't Hang\\" that included Chris Spedding, Slim Jim Phantom and Glen Matlock. Notable \\"Gang\\" dates included the Byron Bay Blues Festival in Australia, and the Azkena Rock Festival in Spain where Gordon and TGTCH performed on a bill with Kiss and Bob Dylan in front of a crowd of 20,000. 2014 June 24, 2014 was the official release date for Gordon's album I'm Coming Home. He toured the U.S. and Europe, and on April 19, 2014, he performed at the 17th annual Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekender at The Car Show event in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This was Dafoe's first feature starring role. Critics generally liked the soundtrack but disliked the film. The Loveless did poorly at the box office but is now considered a cult favorite.

This map shows the approximate region known as the Upland South. The terms Upland South and Upper South refer to the northern section of the Southern United States, in contrast to the Lower South or Deep South. It typically consists of North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and eastern Oklahoma, sometimes also Missouri, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and southern Illinois. Geography thumb|right|Status of the states, 1861. There is a slight difference in usage between the two terms. \\"Upland South\\" is usually defined based on landforms, generally referring to the southern Appalachian Mountains or Appalachia (although not the full region defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission), the Ozarks and Ouachita Mountains, and the plateaus, hills, and basins between the Appalachians and Ozarks, such as the Cumberland Plateau, part of the Allegheny Plateau, the Nashville Basin, the Shawnee Hills, and the Bluegrass Basin, among others. The southern Piedmont region is often considered part of the Upland South, while the Atlantic Coastal Plain (the Chesapeake region and Carolina's Lowcountry) is generally not.The origin and evolution of the Upland South is explored in Meinig (1986), pp. 158, 386, 449 The United States map of Köppen climate classification. In contrast, the term \\"Upper South\\" tends to be defined politically by state. The term dates to the early 19th century and the rise of the Lower South, which became noted for its differences from the more northerly parts of the American South. In antebellum times, the term Upper South generally referred to the slave states north of the Lower or Deep South.Meinig (1993), pg. 293. During the American Civil War era, the term Upper South was often used to refer specifically to the Confederate states that did not secede until after the attack on Fort Sumter—Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. This can also include the border states of Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia, Maryland, or Delaware in the Upper South.Davidson, James West. Nation of Nations: a History of the American Republic. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print. (according to the glossary of the textbook) Today, although many definitions are still based on Civil War-era politics, the term Upper South is often used for all of the American South north of the Deep South. The Encyclopædia Britannica defines the Upper South as the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Upland South is defined by landforms rather than states but encompasses the same general region. The Upper/Upland South is also described in the Encyclopædia Britannica as the \\"Yeoman South,\\" in contrast to the \\"Plantation South.\\" These two definitions cover the same general area. The Upland South, not being defined by state lines, includes parts of Lower South states, such as northwestern South Carolina (the Upstate), North Georgia, North Alabama (and, in some definitions, Central Alabama). It also includes parts of some Northern states, such as Southern Illinois (generally the Shawnee Hills, sometimes to Southern Illinois as a whole), Southern Indiana, Southern Ohio, and extreme southwestern Pennsylvania. Sometimes Eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Mississippi and western Maryland are included as well. In the same way, the Upland South usually does not include parts of some Upper South states, such as the Mississippi embayment (which includes eastern Arkansas, the Missouri Bootheel, the Purchase area of Kentucky, and part of West Tennessee), and the coastal lowlands of North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. Despite these differences, the two terms, Upland South and Upper South, refer to the same general region—the northern part of the American South—and are frequently used synonymously. The corresponding terms, Lower South and Deep South, similarly refer to the same general region to the south of, and lower in elevation, than the Upland or Upper South. Likewise, the terms Lower South and Deep South are often used interchangeably. History and culture The Upland South differs from the Deep South in several significant ways; terrain, histories, economics, demographics, and settlement patterns. Origins The Upland South emerged as a distinct region in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Migration and settlement patterns from colonial coastal regions into the interior had been established for many decades, but the scale grew dramatically toward the end of the 18th century. The general pattern was a westward migration from the lowcountry and Piedmont regions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland, as well as a southwestern migration from Pennsylvania. Large numbers of European immigrants arrived in Philadelphia and followed the Great Wagon Road west and south into the Appalachian Highlands, via the Great Appalachian Valley. These migration streams from Virginia and Pennsylvania resulted in the Shenandoah Valley becoming well-settled as early as 1750. The early settlers of the Ohio Valley were mainly Upland Southerners. Much of the culture of the Upland South originated in southeastern Pennsylvania and spread down the Shenandoah Valley. These migration streams eventually spread through Appalachia and westward through the Appalachian Plateau region into the Ozarks and Ouachitas, and ultimately contributed to the settlement of the Texas Hill Country.Meinig (1998), pg. 224 The main ethnicities of these early settlers included English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German.Drake (2001), pp. 36–38, describes these early pioneer ethnic groups and notes that the term \\"Scotch- Irish\\" (Scots-Irish), while predominantly Presbyterian northern Irish, also included a significant number of Catholic southern Irish; and that the term \\"English\\" was a general catch-all term including ancestries such as French Huguenot (John Sevier's family, for example). On the topic of colonial Catholic Irish immigration, see also Williams (2002), pp. 43–44. The early culture of the Upland South was influenced by other European ethnicities. For example, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden — relatively few in number but pioneering Pennsylvania before the Germans and Irish arrived — contributed techniques of forest pioneering such as the log cabin, the \\"zig-zag\\" split- rail fence, and frontier methods of shifting cultivation such as girdling trees and using slash and burn to convert forest into temporary crop and pasture land.Williams (2002), pg. 104 The pattern of settlement that had begun in the Appalachian foothills was continued and extended through the mountains and highlands to the west and across the Mississippi River into the Ozark highland region. Where there was the danger of Indian attacks, people settled at first in clustered \\"stations,\\" but as danger lessened settlement tended to be in a rural, dispersed, kin-structured pattern, with relatively few towns and cities. These early settlers of the Upland South tended to practice small- scale farming, stock raising, and hunting. This settlement pattern of the Upland South was markedly different from the Deep South and the Midwest. A significant portion of the 19th century settlers of the Midwest were from the Upland South. The southern Midwest was most heavily settled by Upland Southerners, especially in Missouri, southern Indiana and southern Illinois. This early migration to the southern Midwest included many African Americans. They were mainly freed slaves, but slavery was permitted in some places such as St. Louis, under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. In the mid 19th century there were concentrations of African Americans in east-central Indiana, southwest Michigan, and elsewhere. Due to their early settlement of the Midwest, Upland Southerners initially controlled territorial and state governments, and played a major role in establishing the political and social culture, such as the Black Laws of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Over the 19th century the percentage of Upland Southerners fell, especially as large numbers of native born Midwesterners joined the population. Distinct from neighboring regions The Deep South is generally associated historically with cotton. By 1850 the term \\"Cotton States\\" was in common use and the differences between the Deep South (lower) and Upland South (upper) recognized. A key difference was the Deep South's plantation-style cash crop agriculture (mainly cotton, rice, sugar), using African American slaves working large farms while plantation owners tended to live in towns and cities. This system of plantation farming was originally developed in the West Indies and introduced to the United States in South Carolina and Louisiana, from where it spread throughout the Deep South, although there were local exceptions wherever conditions did not support the system. The sharp division between town and country, the intensive use of a few cash crops, and the high proportion of slaves, all contrasted with the Upland South. Virginia and its surrounding region stands out as different from both the Upland South and the Deep South. Its history predates the West Indian plantation model, and while tobacco was a cash crop from the start, and African slaves became widely used, Virginia did not share many of the Deep South's characteristics, such as the early proliferation of towns and cities.For Antebellum differences between the Upper South and Lower South, see Meinig (1998) pp. 222–224 As a result of the difference in the use of slaves, the boundary between the Upland South and Deep South can still be seen today on maps showing the population percentage of African-Americans. The term Black Belt originally referred to a region of black soil in Alabama that was especially good for cotton farming, and has a high percentage of African-Americans. In contrast, the Upland South was less involved with slavery from the start. In addition, the Cotton Belt of the Deep South was controlled by Indians (mainly the Five Civilized Tribes of the Cherokee, Creek (Muscogee), Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole) powerful enough to keep pioneering settlers from moving into the region. The Deep South's cotton boom did not occur until after the Indians were forced west in the early 19th century. In contrast, the Upland South, Kentucky and Tennessee especially, were the scene of Indian resistance and pioneering settlement in the late 18th century. Thus the Upland South was already colonized and had established its particular settlement patterns before most of the Deep South was opened to general colonization. Johnson County in Eastern Kentucky Hardwood forest in Middle Tennessee The differences between the Upland South and lowlands of the Southern Atlantic Seaboard and cotton belt often resulted in regional tension and conflict within states. For example, during the late 18th century, the upland \\"backcountry\\" of North Carolina grew in population until the Upland Southerners there outnumbered the older, well-established, wealthier coastal populations. In some cases the conflict between the two resulted in warfare, such as War of the Regulation in North Carolina. Later, similar processes resulted in divergent populations in states to the west. Northern Alabama, for example, was settled from Tennessee by Upland Southerners, while southern Alabama was one of the core regions of the Deep South cotton boom. During the American Civil War some areas of the Upland South were noted for their resistance to the Confederacy. The uplands of western Virginia became the state of West Virginia as a result, though half the counties of the new state were Secessionist, and partisan warfare continued throughout the war.Weigley, Russell F., A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History, 1861–1865, Indiana Univ. Press, 2000, pg. 55 Kentucky and Missouri remained in the Union but were torn by internal strife. The southern Appalachian region of East Tennessee, parts of western North Carolina and some parts of Northern Alabama and Northern Georgia were widely noted for their pro-Union sentiments. The two regions also differ physically. The upland south is dominated by deciduous hardwood forest, in contrast to the Deep South's predominantly evergreen pine forests. The upland south is often much hillier than the deep south, due to the Deep South being part of the coastal plain. Today The Upland South contains its own sub-regions. The fertile lowlands of the Nashville Basin and the Bluegrass Basin gave rise to the cities of Nashville, Lexington, and Louisville, which grew into banking and mercantile centers in the 19th century, home to an elite class of Upland Southerners, including bankers, lawyers, educators, and politicians. The abundance of iron ore, coal, and limestone in the Birmingham District transformed a gritty boom town into the iron and steel city of Birmingham which anchored the southern urban industrial powerhouse and gave rise to a class of blue collar workers who were the life blood of the city, as well as a cosmopolitan class of bankers, lawyers, and politicians. Most of the Upland South, however, remained rural in character. Although historically very rural, the Upland South was one of the nation's early industrial regions and continues to be today. Mining of coal, iron, copper, and other minerals has been part of the region's economy since the 18th century. As early as 1750 lead and zinc were mined in Wythe County, Virginia, and copper was mined and smelted in Polk County, Tennessee. Two major Appalachian goldfields were developed, the first in western North Carolina beginning in 1799. By 1825 Rutherford County was the center of the nation's most extensive gold mining. In 1828 a much richer Gold Strike was made in North Georgia, mostly within what was then the territory of the Cherokee Nation. The mining camp of Dahlonega boomed during the ensuing Georgia Gold Rush. Iron foundries in Virginia and early coal mining operations in central Appalachia date to before 1850. Furnaces and forges were built in the Appalachians of North Central Alabama as early as 1818 and by 1871 would give rise to Birmingham later known as the Pittsburgh of the South as it became the leading industrial and transportation hub of the south. Some of these early furnaces and forges were fueled with nearby deposits of bituminous coal. Similar examples of early urban-industrial areas include Embree's Iron Works in East Tennessee (1808), the Red River iron region of Estill County, Kentucky (1806–8), and the Jackson Iron Works near Morgantown, West Virginia (1830). Wheeling, West Virginia was known as \\"Nail City\\" in the 1840s and 1850s. By 1860 Tennessee was the third largest iron-producing state in the nation, after Pennsylvania and New York. The scale of mining, especially coal mining, increased dramatically after 1870. The importance of mining and metallurgy can be seen in the many towns with names such as Pigeon Forge and Bloomery (a bloomery being a type of smelting furnace), scattered across the Upland South. Logging has also been an important part of the Upland South's economy. The region became the United States' primary source of timber after railroads allowed large scale industrial logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Today, the historic importance of the Upland South's forests can be seen in its many national forests, such as Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina, and Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky, among many others. The Upland South's terrain and forests, as well as history and culture, occur in parts of states usually associated with the Midwest and Deep South. These areas are often associated with national forests, for example Mark Twain National Forest in southern Missouri, Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois, Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana, Wayne National Forest in southeast Ohio, William B. Bankhead National Forest in northern Alabama, Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in northern Georgia, Sumter National Forest in South Carolina, and Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Map of primary areas of Tobacco production in the U.S., with the areas of greater production in dark green and those of lesser production in light green. Textile mills and industry have been an important factor in the Upland South's economy since the time of the Deep South's cotton boom.Today the Upland South contains a diversity of people and economics. Some parts, like the Shenandoah Valley, are famous for their rural qualities, while other parts, like the Tennessee Valley, are heavily industrialized. Knoxville and Huntsville are both centers of industry and scientific research. Tobacco is still a large crop in Kentucky and North Carolina. As a cultural region The Upper South today remains a culture region, with distinct ancestry, dialect, cuisine, religion and other characteristics. The heavily rhotacized Upland Southern dialect still predominates in much of West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the southern portions of North Carolina, Maryland, Missouri and Virginia. Noticeable influence can even be found in parts of the Deep South such as northern Georgia and northern Alabama. Cities as far north such as St. Louis and Cincinnati carry noticeable influence as well. Similar to the Deep South, the region is heavily evangelical Protestant with Baptists making up a plurality in the vast majority of counties. The cuisine of the Upper South is generally closely related to the lowland south, excluding southern low-country areas in which the cuisine tends to involve seafood and rice, which are not common in the Upper South.

This usually occurs in the lumbosacral region, as this is where the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is greatest, but the spinal canal can be affected in any plane. Signs and symptoms Most common symptoms include lower back pain, headaches, weakness, numbness (anesthesia) above and below the involved limb, leg pain, and sometimes there can be rectal and genital pain. Bowel and bladder dysfunction, urinary retention or even incontinence may occur. The symptoms are usually exacerbated by upright posture and often but not always relieved by lying down. However, in many patients it is asymptomatic. Causes It is common in Marfan syndrome, occurring in 63–92% of people with the syndrome. Dural ectasia may also occur in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, ankylosing spondylitis, and trauma. In neurofibromatosis type I it has been theorized that local infiltration of the dura by plexiform neurofibromas leads to a weakening of the dural allowing the outpouching. A retrospective study found that a majority of dural ectasia were associated with nearby plexiform neurofibromas. Polster SP, Dougherty MC, Zeineddine HA, et al.

They are also called \\"civil rights anthems\\" or, in the more hymn-like cases, \\"civil rights hymns.\\" Freedom songs were a way of life during the civil rights movement. The songs contained many meanings for all participants. Songs could embody sadness, happiness, joy, or determination among many other feelings. Freedom songs served as mechanisms for unity among the black community during the movement. The songs also served as a means of communication among the participants when words just were not enough. The song \\"We Shall Overcome\\" quickly became the face of the movement. Guy Carawan taught the popular freedom song during the spring of 1960 in a workshop held at Highlander Folk School, making the song extremely popular within the community. Music of the civil rights era was crucial to the productivity of the movement. Music communicated unspeakable feelings and the desire for radical change across the nation. Music strengthened the movement, adding variety to freedom progression strategies. Music was highly successful in that the songs were direct and repetitive, getting the message across clearly and efficiently. Melodies were simple with repeating choruses, which allowed easy involvement within both black and white communities furthering the spread of the song's message. There was often more singing than talking during protests and demonstrations, showing how powerful the songs really were. Nurturing those who came to participate in the movements was vital, which would be done in the form of song. Participants felt a connectedness with one another and their movement through the songs. Freedom songs were often used politically to grab the attention of the nation to address the severity of segregation. Songs were often derived from the Christian background, usually from hymns. Hymns were slightly altered to incorporate wording reflective upon civil rights protests, and current situations as they were brought out of the churches and into the streets. Although most freedom songs derived from hymns, it was important to include songs from other genres. To accommodate those who were not as religious, rock and roll songs could be altered to become freedom songs, which allowed for a broader number of activists to partake in the singing. In several cases these songs began as gospel or spiritual, the most famous of these being \\"We Shall Overcome,\\"Kansas State University \\"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\\", \\"This Little Light of Mine\\", and \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\".Smithsonian Global Sound Nina Simone and other professional artists are also known for writing or singing such songs. Two examples being: * \\"Mississippi Goddam\\", from Nina Simone in Concert (1964). * \\"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\\", from Black Gold (1970). Activist Fannie Lou Hamer is known for singing songs at marches or other protests, particularly \\"This Little Light of Mine.\\" Zilphia Horton also played a role in the conversion of spirituals to civil rights songs. Additional freedom songs Some 100 or so songs were commonly sung on Civil Rights Movement protests during the 1960s. Some of the best-known or most influential are: * \\"A Change Is Gonna Come (song)\\": Composed and performed by Sam Cooke; #12 on the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list of Rolling Stone magazine * \\"Oh, Freedom\\": a spiritual dating back to slavery times * \\"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round\\" * \\"Certainly Lord\\": based on a spiritual * \\"Hold On\\" (also known as \\"Keep Your Eye On The Prize\\"): Based on a spiritual * \\"How I Got Over\\" * \\"I Love Everybody\\", the most important song in the civil rights movement according to SCLC's James Bevel and Andrew Young, sometimes sung for an hour at a time. * \\"If You Miss Me at the Back of the Bus\\": Adapted from a composition by Chico Neblett * \\"I'm Gonna Sit at the Welcome Table\\": Adapted from a Spiritual * \\"I Woke Up This Mornin'\\": Adapted from a Spiritual * \\"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\\": Composed by James Weldon Johnson * \\"This Little Light of Mine\\": Originally a spiritual, associated with Fannie Lou Hamer.Essence * \\"We shall not be moved\\": Also, likely originally, a labor union song. * \\"If I had a hammer\\": A labor union song by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays. * \\"Hymn to Freedom\\": Composed and performed by Oscar Peterson See also * Civil rights movement in popular culture Notes Bibliography * Everybody Says Freedom, by Pete Seeger & Bob Reiser.

History The first religious building on the site of the present church was a Roman monument, perhaps a temple of Attis, whose worship was probably the cause of the Christian persecution in Lyon from 177. In the 5th century, according to tradition, Eucherius of Lyon, 19th bishop of Lyon, built on the ruins of the building a basilica to contain the relics of the martyrs in Lyon, tortured in 177. The church received the name \\"Church of Holy Apostles\\". In the 6th century, the bishops were buried in the church, particularly Nicetius of Lyon, the 28th bishop. The body of the latter attracted a crowd and his presumed great miracles led the church to take his name.Anne-Catherine Le Mer, Claire Chomer, Carte archéologique de la Gaule, Lyon 69/2, Paris 2007, pp. 341-343 Saint Austregisilus was abbot here during the 7th century. In the early 8th century, the church has been ravaged by the Saracens and by Charles Martel. It was rebuilt in the 9th century, at the behest of the bishop Leidrade.J. B. Martin, 1908-1909, pp. 348-358 Peter Waldo, in the 13th century, was a parishioner. His disciples, shocked by the wealth of the church, even set fire in 1253. From the 14th century to the late 16th century, the church was gradually rebuilt. In 1562, the notables gathered in the church, and in the 17th century, the aldermen were elected in the nave. It suffered the damage caused by several bands of Huguenot, which plundered the bishops of Lyon's tombs, then those of the French Revolution. After the French Revolution, the church served as flour warehouse. In the late 18th century, the project to transform the church into a gallery was abandoned after a petition signed by 100 notables. The sacristy was built in 1816, and the organ was installed in 1886. The church was in the 1970s the center of a popular neighborhood. Its presence was highlighted during its occupation by some prostitutes of the neighborhood in 1975 to express their anger towards police and social harassment. This church has often been perceived as a place of refuge and hospitality in the city. In the beginning in 1968, renovations undertaken by the management of the monument historique and the city of Lyon began, and they ended in 1998. Architecture The church is mainly built in the Gothic style with a Renaissance portal. Among its particularities are: * a crypt * Several side chapels * The tomb of Pauline-Marie Jaricot * Mosaics by Gaspard Poncet, representing the Virgin Mary and the 48 martyrs of Lyon * A statue of the Virgin made by Antoine Coysevox * A neogothic pulpit made after a design by Benoît * The stale of the chapter of canons * Stained glasses by Bégule, Gruber and Lavergne * A 17th-century clock * A plaque about the marriage of Frederic Ozanam Famous people One of the side chapels In the 17th century, theologian Bédien Morange was cantor and canon of Saint-Nizier. In the 19th century, the parish hosted famous spiritual people such as Frederic Ozanam, founder of the Saint-Vincent de Paul conferences, and Pauline-Marie Jaricot, foundress of the Propagation of the Faith. The church has been directed by priests and laity of the Emmanuel Community since 1996.

Description Monster Mythology is a 128-page leatherette-bound trade paperback written by Carl Sargent, with interior artwork by John and Laura Lakey, Keith Parkinson, and Terry Dykstra. It was the fourth book in the Dungeon Master's Guide Rules series that was created for the second edition of AD&D.; The purpose of the book is to detail non-human deities, which, to that point, had not been described for this edition of AD&D.; As author Shannon Applecline points out, \\"Though the book is putatively a 'monster' mythology, it actually contains deities for demihumans, humanoids, and monsters alike.\\" It contains detailed information on the societies, cultures, myths, and deities of several non- human pantheons, including those of the elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, orcs, goblins, dragons, giants, drow, and many other creatures. Keith Eisenbeis suggests the book can be thematically divided in two, with the first encompassing typical player character races, and the second detailing \\"gods of the major intelligent societal creatures\\". Contents Introduction The introduction sets out the theme of the book — non-human deities — and provides notes on using deities in a campaign, their common abilities, and how they are arranged in four tiers of power from Demigod up to Greater God. The Gods The majority of the book describes 131 divine beings, divided into eight mythos sections. Each entry includes a description, some game statistics including the deity's alignment, the most common alignment of its worshippers, the god's area of control, and the god's symbol). Each section also describes the god's avatar and priesthood.

Appendix 2: Deities and Game Worlds This short appendix gives references where a Dungeon Master may find 2nd edition AD&D; details on the deities of specific game worlds, such as the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Dark Sun. Reception In the May-June 1983 edition of White Wolf Magazine (Issue 36), Keith Eisenbeis thought Monster Mythology was a \\"good product\\", but believed that the priests described were too powerful and unbalanced the game. Additionally, Eisenbeis thought inequities in the ability of priests to advance based on race were unfair. Overall, he gave the book an average rating of 3 out of 5. Writing in 2014, Shannon Appelcline called author Carl Sargent \\"one of TSR's best- respected authors in the 90s\\", and commented that this book \\"more than doubled the count of humanoid, demihuman, and monstrous deities. In particular it detailed new gods for underdark races like beholders, illithids, myconids, and svirfnebli, new undersea gods, new draconic gods, and new faerie gods (including Shakespearian favorites Titania and Oberon).\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Monster Mythology"},{"id":"8152204","text":"White Collar Zen is a project by Steven Heine, who is primarily known for his research on medieval Japanese religion and society. The project deals with the principles of Zen Buddhism in relation to the contemporary workplace and professional leadership issues. White Collar Zen demonstrates how to incorporate Zen principles into daily work life in order to achieve professional success. In addition to the book – White Collar Zen: Using Zen Principles to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Your Goal (Oxford University Press, 2005) – White Collar Zen is a multi-faceted project that includes a unique course on Asian Cultural Values in Business sponsored by the Eugenio Pino Entrepreneurship Center at Florida International University, as well as workshops and conferences on ancient Asian wisdom and modern business. The Asian Cultural Values in Business course was first taught in fall 2006. On November 17, 2006 a conference was held titled From East to West and West to East. It included four panels that discussed how Asia has influenced the way the West does business and vice versa, and included such topics as Asian investment and international issues, leadership in a global perspective, and Asian cultural values and entrepreneurship. The panels featured student presentations from the Asian Cultural Values in Business course and various other speakers. Among them were authors of business negotiations in Asia: Mark McNeilly (Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers), Bill Diffenderffer (The Samurai Leader), and Kaihan Krippendorff (The Art of Advantage: 36 Strategies to Seize the Competitive Edge). How to Tell a Buddha from a Fox In Asia, the mythical Fox is the primary symbol of how one can become entangled in a web of misunderstanding. The Fox, which appears to its unwitting victim in human form, represents the deception and duplicity that brings with it self-doubt and frustrates the pursuit of aspirations. It is a symbol of undesirable tendencies, such as chasing after unattainable aims while leaving important parts of life unattended. Along with Foxes who deceive, however, there are always the Buddhas who are eager to support, not because of personal ties or loyalty, but because they objectively evaluate the merits and demerits of a situation. Both the Fox and the Buddha are often disguised and each tries to pass as the other for strategic purposes. Distinguishing between them is a valuable skill. As decisions hang in the balance, the Unmoving Mind is a tool to separate truth or authenticity from illusion or untruth. Illusion renders you vulnerable to anxiety and confusion and unable to react to critical situations with clarity and lucidity. Elevation–Purification–Activation The process of Elevation- Purification-Activation (EPA) cultivates four basic levels of human consciousness: feeling or emotion, speaking or communication, thinking or logic, and knowing or intuitive awareness. When one is controlled by emotions, his or her actions become hasty and s/he is likely to say something inappropriate. The key is to elevate and purify one's feelings so that they are balanced and objective. In attaining the Hermit's objective, one can effectively bring about constructive change. Tamed emotions are transmuted into the foundation of productive understanding. Such an understanding enables one to act with the Warrior's effortless, spontaneous creativity. The Hermit and the Warrior Heine describes how Zen embraces two different and seemingly contradictory yet harmonious paths of behavior. The Way of the Hermit teaches detachment – the mental clarity you need to view your situation dispassionately and impartially, to perceive who is a friend and who is an enemy, to understand what is possible and what is not. The Way of the Warrior teaches the ability to act without hesitation and at the appropriate moment. Together, the ways can prepare one to meet the challenges of the modern world of business. Both ways can be applied to contemporary affairs. The Warrior is always on the move and is able to establish a base of power while transient. The shifts and transitions do not conflict, but in the end enhance the Warrior's abilities. The Hermit is also in a state of continuing transition. A hermit gains strength through passivity, standing back from conflict, looking at things clearly and objectively, and remaining noncommittal until it is absolutely necessary to react. He aggressively pursues passivity by moving, not standing still and seeking out areas and arenas where constructive passivity can best be applied. The Warrior is dynamic, assertive and taking a stand. A Hermit is also dynamic in his own way by actively not taking a stand. In integrating the Warrior and Hermit approaches, Zen training provides a timely new paradigm for being clear in thoughts and disciplined in actions to establish harmonious interpersonal relations and attain mutually beneficial goals. Encounter vs. Confrontation A key objective is to transform dysfunctional conflicts (or Confrontations) rife with antagonism and turmoil into creative negotiations (or Encounters) characterized by shared purposes and cooperation. In a Confrontation, words do not ease tensions or have a reforming impact but cause the basic inflexibility of structure to tighten. It is characterized by personal will and gain, divisiveness, threats, and demands. It results in a direct challenge based on alternating aggressive and passive attitudes which lead to conflict and discord. A Confrontation compounds futility and leads to further misunderstanding, whereas an Encounter is a productive form of negotiation with mutually beneficial results. Through negotiations, agreements, and ongoing teamwork, one can use indirect methods to reach goals by creating situations that facilitate cooperation. Both approaches involve some kind of meeting but the former, by being one- dimensional in attitude, fails to mobilize multiple factors of constructive engagement. The Four Steps The Four Steps are a means of developing self- discipline and self-control to overcome obstacles at the workplace and achieve success in the professional world through an Encounter. By cultivating the Unmoving Mind and by applying the methods discussed in White Collar Zen, one is able to deal with professional challenges: Step 1: Recognize a Crisis in Structure Recognize a crisis in the structure of the work organizational environment and work through channels by investigating the roots of the problem, but without jumping to conclusions in either blaming others or remaining unassertive. Step 2: Use Words Creatively Speak creatively to alter perceptions and receptivity regarding a problem in organizational structure by getting one's message across effectively. One persuades not because of self-interest, but based on genuine commitment to ideals and goals. Step 3: Silence as a Tool for Strategic Planning Move beyond reliance on words by knowing when to refrain from speaking if verbal communication falls short, and let events take a natural course through waiting patiently yet without becoming overly passive. Step 4: Enter the Realm of Anti- Structure When both words and no-words fail, a more inventive form of White Collar Zen is required, which is found in the fourth step, the path of anti- structure. Awakening the Unmoving Mind empowers you to cross over invisible lines of hierarchy and division. Seize the moment for a bold, break the rules anti-structural expression that is based on integrity and responsibility. Cutting through structure involves taking risks but can be appropriate and conducive to progressive interaction and growth. There are times when the attitudes or behavior of Zen masters are unpredictable and even outrageous in questioning authority that is arbitrary and therefore oppressive. A famous saying is, \\"If you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha.\\" This approach relinquishes any attachment to security and safety and takes a Zen master's leap from a 100-foot pole.

History It began in 1994 as a protest against the entry fees of the corporate-sponsored New Music West festival. Since the initial one night stand against the corporate-sponsored New Music West festival, Music Waste has become an integral part of the Vancouver music scene, highlighting the most innovative and exciting bands of Vancouver and surrounding areas. To make the festival as accessible as possible, all of the shows cost a maximum of $5 and are held at venues within walking distance. From 2004 to 2008, Music Waste had been organized by Only (magazine), who also printed a festival guide featuring absurd, tongue-in-cheek write-ups about the bands performing. Discorder (magazine) has since taken over printing the festival guide. Since 2008, Music Waste has remained entirely non-profit, and is organized by a group of dedicated volunteers. Music Waste's \\"flipping-the- bird\\" logo and the \\"goofball\\" logo were designed by Vancouver artist Sean Maxey.

There are also a variety of classified staff who provide classroom support, clerical services, grounds and building services and food services. The current teachers' union contract is in effect from July 2005 until July 2010. Building The construction of the building was completed in August 1997 for a projected 1050 students. The cost was $93.64 per square foot with a total cost of $10,094,804. The total area of new construction was 107,800. Parental and staff concern regarding the size of the building resulted in the creation of a bipolar building the three 4th- grade areas at one end (each visually divided into 125-pupil clusters), and two 5th-grade, 125-pupil teaching teams at the other. Hayes Large Architects developed the project. The focal point of the school is the student “commons” area, which includes an adaptable assembly performance space with a raised platform stage that is handicapped accessible, a gymnasium, and cafeteria with full kitchen facilities. The design of the school, with pitched roofs and dormers, was meant to reflect the rural vernacular design of local farm buildings. Environmental Education Grant The Environmental Education Grant Program was established by the Environmental Education Act of 1993, which mandates that 5 percent of all pollution fines and penalties collected annually by the Department of Environmental Protection be set aside for environmental education.

School safety and bullying The Selinsgrove Area Intermediate School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the School in 2012. Additionally, there was one incident involving a knife and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in one incident at the school. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Selinsgrove Area School Board has provided the District's Bullying/Cyberbullying policy 249 online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. The District provides a form to report bullying online. The faculty and staff are trained in reinforcement of anti-bullying and harassment practices and policies. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3.

Reluctant Saint: The Life of Francis of Assisi, Penguin, 2003, p. 111 Francis then sent Bernard to Lombardy.Blessed Bernard da Quintavalle, The Franciscan Annals, vol. 2, London. R. Washbourn. 1878, pp. 225 et seq. He was then sent to Florence. After the family of St Clare tried to forcibly remove her from the Benedictine convent of San Paulo near Bastia, Bernard accompanied her the Benedictine nuns of the convent of . In 1213, he accompanied Francis on a missionary journey through Spain, but directed Bernard to remain behind at one point to tend to a poor invalid. When they met again a year later, the sick man had recovered, and Francis and Bernard continued through Aragon and Catalonia, Roussillon to Montpellier, and through Piedmont back to his chapel at Santa Maria dei Angeli in Assisi. He subsequently became Minister Provincial in Spain until 1219, when he was succeeded by John Parenti. Together with Angelo Tancredi, and Leo of Assisi, Bernard remained close to Francis, especially during the last two years of Francis' life. St Francis imparted a special blessing to him,Ellsberg, Robert. The Franciscan Saints although Thomas of Celano reserves this blessing for Elias. After the death of Francis, Bernard had occasion to take to task the Vicar General Elias for riding in a large horse-drawn coach, which to Bernard was not in accord with the Rule.Arnald of Sarrant.

This highway was built south of Interstate 96 (I-96) as an additional crossing over the Grand River. The route runs from M-45 northward and across the river to a connection with I-96 near the current M-104 interchange. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) announced the proposed highway in early November 2006. The new corridor was funded through a Congressional appropriation and a state employment program. The Grand River bridge construction was originally planned for 2010 while the land for the project was being acquired. Other smaller bridges were included in the original plans. Roadway construction was scheduled for 2012. Recent developments in MDOT schedules had construction starting on the Grand River bridge after federal approval was secured with the remainder of the project deferred until additional funding is in place. The road opened on October 30, 2015, as a two-lane, limited-access expressway. Route description M-231 begins along M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) in Robinson Township near the intersection with 120th Avenue. It runs due north through a mix of farm fields and forest lands in Ottawa County. The highway is a two-lane, limited-access highway. The trunkline crosses North Cedar Drive on an overpass, and then it crosses the Grand River into Crockery Township. As it crosses the river, M-231 angles northeasterly before intersecting M-104 the latter's eastern terminus at I-96, and M-231 continues north to its own northern terminus at a new partial interchange with I-96. Aerial view of M-231 in August 2015 Even though it does not physically connect to that highway, M-231 is a scaled-down bypass of US 31 through Grand Haven. The highway is expected to reduce response times for emergency services in the area by shortening the driving distance across the Grand River. The bridge over the river, including approaches over adjacent wetlands, is the seventh-longest in the state at and sits above the river. Seven other bridges along M-231 bring the total to nearly a mile (1.6 km) for the entire highway. The highway project included the construction of a non- motorized pathway parallel to the road. The path was built using funds from the Michigan Department of Transportation Alternative Program, and it was designed as part of a collection of bike trails to connect the Lake Michigan shoreline with Grand Rapids and across the Grand River. The trail was dedicated on October 17, 2015, as the \\"Sgt. Henry E. Plant Memorial Grand River Bridge Non-Motorized Pathway\\", named for Ottawa County's first Medal of Honor recipient, Henry E. Plant, a veteran of the American Civil War. History Initial planning for what is now M-231 started before 1990. In 2006, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) was acquiring land for the highway right-of-way and designing sections of the highway. The route going to the Grand River from M-45 was being designed at this time as well. The department was expecting the construction of the bridge over the river to begin in 2010 and last until at least 2013. There was another small creek or river that also required a bridge to be built. That project was projected to begin in 2011 and end in 2012. One more bridge was being considered over Leonard Street, a major street that runs east to west halfway between I-96 and the Grand River. Construction of that bridge was projected to begin in 2012. On I-96 itself, a bridge that went over the abandoned Grand Trunk Western Railroad was projected to be replaced starting in 2012. Further work on I-96 was projected to begin in 2012 to create the new interchange between it and M-231. That included extending 112th Avenue over I-96 and placing a bridge over the M-231 ramp for I-96. The last item on the five-year plan list was the running from the Grand River to I-96. That construction was also projected to begin in 2012. Grand River bridge approaches under construction in March 2014 The 2005 SAFETEA-LU transportation bill provided funding earmarked for the project by US Representative Pete Hoekstra from Holland as well as matching funds from the state's Michigan Jobs Today program. The total cost of the project was expected to be near $150 million (equivalent to $ in ). In late 2009, the five-year plan for 2010–14 was released with a much different construction schedule. The bridge over the Grand River was to be built starting in 2010 following the final approvals from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in late 2009 or early 2010. Only the bridge substructure and approaches were being constructed, with the remainder of M-231 to be deferred until future five-year plans. On April 23, 2010, FHWA approved the M-231 project with a record of decision (ROD). This document allowed MDOT to begin the final engineering, land acquisitions and construction of the project. MDOT announced plans at that time to start the Grand River Bridge construction in late 2010 or early 2011, with the remaining project plans deferred until funding issues were resolved. The ROD also encompassed planned improvements to the US 31 corridor north of Holland and in Grand Haven. Construction on the roadway started on March 28, 2011, with the demolition of three homes in Robinson Township. At least one other home was moved from the path of the road as well. By January 4, 2013, MDOT had completed work on a bridge over North Cedar Drive, additional ramps at the I-96 and M-104 interchange, and reconstruction and widening of M-104 near I-96. The department had also completed a reconfiguration of the intersection between M-104 and Cleveland Drive and widening the bridge that carries M-104 over I-96. The expected date of completion for M-231 was set for sometime in 2016 pending funding availability. MDOT planned to build of the new highway in 2013, including the bridges over the Grand River and Little Robinson Creek. Grand River bridge in August 2015 Bridge construction was delayed over Grand River flooding in spring 2013. In 2014, the new interchange at I-96 was completed. The steel beams spanning the river were not set in place until August 2014. MDOT announced in August 2015 that they would hold a \\"M23.1k Run\\" on October 3, 2015, before the highway opened to traffic. The agency limited participation to 231 runners. The highway opened to traffic on October 30, 2015, and the total cost for M-231 was estimated at $180 million. Future In early 2020, local homeowners received notices related to potential zoning changes in Zeeland Township related to a proposed southern extension of M-231 between M-45 and I-196. At the time, MDOT did not have funding nor a timeline for such an extension, although they identified a potential corridor to local media. Ottawa County is working with local communities such as Zeeland Township on these zoning changes that are designed to preserve potential right-of-way for the highway.

In his poetry, he praised the Sarmatism culture. He was the chaplain of one of the best military units of his times, irregular unit of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth light cavalry - Lisowczycy, fighting on battlefields from Picardy to the banks of the White Sea. Dębołęcki has chronlicled their history in his Przewagi elearów polskich, or The victories of Polish cavalry (1623). Dębołęcki was born into a szlachta family of Jakub Konojadzki and Barbara née Decjusz. As a teenager, he acquired good education, studying at a Franciscan school in Kraków, and joining the order in 1603. Probably in 1603 - 1605 he stayed in Opole, and in 1615, preached in Kalisz. In 1617, he was sent to Chełmno, and probably in late 1617, he left Poland, heading to Venice and Rome. Dębołęcki spent two years in Italy: on his way back, he stopped at Olomouc, creating the Association of Christian Soldiers. In 1621 - 1622, Dębołęcki served as a chaplain of the Lisowczycy, a legendary light cavalry unit, which at that time was under the service of the Holy Roman Emperor in the Thirty Years' War. He fought with them in Hungary, and after the dissolution of the force, went to Rome to continue studies and achieve a doctorate in theology (1623-1625). In 1626, Dębołęcki settled in Kamieniec Podolski, where he founded an organization which purchased prisoners from Muslim hands. Some of his works were controversial and were published anonymously under pseudonyms, so their authorship is uncertain. According to some sources, Dębołęcki’s reputation was dubious, and to clean his name, once again he went to Rome, staying there in 1630 - 1632. After returning to Poland, he settled in Lwów.

History C8 - the ATA Connection, as a branded regional feeder operation, ceased being used when the remaining assets of Chicago Express were completely divested from AMTRAN, INC.'s successor company early in 2006, and some months before that when the fleet was withdrawn from service, owned aircraft parked, and leased airplanes returned to their lease owners. Chicago Express, operating as the ATA Connection, flew British Aerospace Jetstream 31 turboprops which were then replaced with Saab 340 turboprops. C8 was also the IATA code used when travel agencies were writing tickets upon Chicago Express routes, and booking travel between airlines not affiliated or owned by ATA. When the remains of Chicago Express (C8) were liquidated, the company was sold as Chicago Express, just as it read on the company's original airline operating certificate. ATA Connection's imagery and logos do not live on, unlike BMI Regional's logos and trademarks after the buyout of parent airline BMI. Industry perceptions The type of arrangement the C8 code and ATA Connection's form of logo and branding separating the two, has in the past at other companies, led to many public and corporate perception problems. Examples of such would be Ransome Airlines, who much of the informed among the aviation industry, was under the impression had completely exited the business of aviation, when its parent company had collapsed in bankruptcy. However, Ransome Airlines as Trans World Express continued to operate for years to come, unbeknownst to many. Similarly, for many lay individuals, when one sees the Pan Am emblem and logo emblazoned upon railways and airplanes at airports in literally identical Pan Am Clipper Connection or Pan Am Railways form, this tends to leave the impression to all, that the original business is still in place. As in the case of Pan Am Systems also unbeknownst to many, no business connection to the original Pan American World Airways exists, although Pan Am's distinctive logo who Pan Am System owns, has been through four generations of different corporate usage. C8 the IATA code of ATA Connection, C8 the certificated airline and former subsidiary of ATA Airlines parent company, and C8 the brand identified with ATA Connection are once and for all defunct. Amtran, and ATA Holdings continue to exist but in the renamed form of Global Aero Logistics. ATA Airlines, a fully certificated airline carrier, IATA code TZ, ended operations in April 2008 as a result of the controlling interests of the MatlinPatterson hedge fund's reallocation of Amtran/ATA Holdings/ATA Airlines capital resources into the continued leveraged investments of DC-10 equipment, and World Airways / North American Airlines causing and resulting in the financial insolvency of ATA Airlines through these collateralized transactions.

Several of his films are classics in the genre of visual music. Early life James Whitney was born December 27, 1921, in Pasadena, California, and lived all his life in the Los Angeles area. He studied painting, and traveled in England before the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, he returned to Pasadena. Career – early works  James completed a number of short films over four decades, two of which required at least five years of work. James collaborated with his brother John for some of his early film work. The first of the brothers' films was Twenty-Four Variations on an Original Theme. Its structure was influenced by Schoenberg's serial principles. James spent 3 years working on Variations on a Circle (1942), which lasts some 20 minutes, and was made with 8mm film. James and John created their series of Five Film Exercises (John #1 and #5; James #2, #3 and #4) between 1943 and 1944, for which the brothers won a prize for best sound at the 1949 Brussels Experimental Film Competition. In 1946, the brothers travelled to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to show their films at the first of ten annual \\"Art in Cinema\\" festivals, organized by Frank Stauffacher. Following this period, James became more involved in spiritual interests such as Jungian psychology, alchemy, yoga, Tao, and Jiddu Krishnamurti. These interests heavily influenced his later work. James was a potter and ceramicist, interested in raku ware, and examples of his pottery still exist today. Career – later works  Screenshot from \\"Lapis\\" by James Whitney Between 1950 and 1955, James laboured to construct a truly astounding masterpiece, Yantra. The film was produced entirely by hand. By punching grid patterns in 5\\" by 7\\" cards with a pin, James was able to paint through these pinholes onto other 5\\" x 7\\" cards, to create images of rich complexity and give the finished work a very dynamic and flowing motion, but the film was not completed yet. It was first released as a silent film. A very short, black and white, manipulated fragment from an early version of Yantra was shown at one of the historic Vortex Concerts in San Francisco's Morrison planetarium in early 1959. Soon after Vortex, the film acquired its soundtrack, when Jordan Belson synchronized it to an excerpt from Henk Badings’ \\"Cain and Abel\\". This did not occur at the Morrison Planetarium Vortex Concerts, contrary to popular belief (Keefer, 2008). Analogue computer equipment developed by brother John, allowed James to complete Lapis (1966) in two years, when it might have taken seven years otherwise. James drew dot patterns again for this film, but the camera was positioned using computer control, allowing each image to be overlaid from multiple angles. In this piece, smaller circles oscillate in and out in an array of colors resembling a kaleidoscope while being accompanied by Indian sitar music. The patterns become hypnotic and trance inducing. Dwija (1973), meaning \\"twice-born\\" or \\"soul\\" in Sanskrit, is completely solarized, and much of the imagery is re- photographed by rear-projection to create a constant flow of hardly definable transformations of color and form. Wu Ming (1977), meaning \\"no name\\" in Chinese, repeats a single action over and over – a particle disappears into infinity, and returns as a wave. James described the particle-to-wave action in Wu Ming as being \\"like throwing a pebble into water and seeing the ripples spread out\\". His two final films, intended to form a quartet with Dwija and Wu Ming, were Kang Jing Xiang and Li, which were left incomplete when James died April 8, 1982, after a brief and unexpected illness. Kang was completed post- humously according to James' instructions. His short test for Li is believed to be lost. Several of James' films were preserved by Center for Visual Music (CVM) in Los Angeles; HD transfers from their preservation project were seen in major museum exhibitions including Visual Music at MOCA and The Hirshhorn Museum (2005), Sons et Lumieres at Centre Pompidou (2004–05), The Third Mind at The Guggenheim Museum, and other shows. Scholars may view high quality copies of Yantra and Lapis at CVM. CVM also provided prints from this preservation to Centre Pompidou, Paris, which provided support for this project. As of this writing in 2017, the films are largely not in distribution, and difficult to rent or screen. Archive The Academy Film Archive houses the Whitney Collection and has preserved over a dozen films from the collection. The collection encompasses the work of John and James Whitney, as well as John's sons Mark, John, and Michael.

Since her entry into the entertainment industry in 1995, she has appeared on numerous magazine covers and TV programs. Her stage name is occasionally confused with that of radio presenter Emma Boughton, who is also known as \\"Emma B\\". Modeling career Emma Blocksage was spotted at about the time of her 15th birthday in April 1994 by Hastings model agent Martin Robinson in Bexhill's De La Warr Pavilion when she entered a modelling contest co-sponsored by his agency, Martin Enterprises—Studio 17. Before the event had started, Martin Robinson saw her walking through the foyer and stated, \\"One day she will be a supermodel\\". Having contacted Elite Model Management, one of the world's best-known agencies, she subsequently won their \\"Look of the Year\\" in July 1995 at the age of 16. The win was followed by a lucrative modeling contract with Elite, resulting in the young model, now known as Emma B, embarking on a high-profile path in the industry. As a fashion model, Emma B was in high demand and travelled the world, appearing in catwalk shows and ad campaigns for top designers, including Chanel, Prada, Valentino, Guess?, Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier, Westwood, Hamnett and Bella Freud. Her image has been on the covers of Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Marie Claire and numerous others, while a lucrative lingerie contract with Debenhams featured her as their \\"lingerie face\\" for two years. This led to intense media interest and she soon became a favourite celebrity face and glamour model in the British tabloids and gossip pages. As a result of her celebrity status, she became a \\"name\\" model, appearing regularly in such publications as FHM, Stuff, Maxim, Front, GQ, News of the World, Daily Star, The Sun, Closer, Nuts, Zoo and Donna.

It is the sequel to Lost in Blue. The game was followed by Lost in Blue 3. Story The main characters are Jack and Amy, two young teenagers who have been shipwrecked on a deserted island. The player chooses to be either Jack, the boy character, or Amy, the girl character. The player takes on most of the responsibilities of the camp, but they are able to request favors of their partner, such as cooking, making rope from vines, or collecting firewood. Each character has special skills, e.g., Jack is able to climb twice as high as his female companion, is better at cooking food, and is a stronger fighter. On the other hand, Amy is a better swimmer, can find food more easily, and has a steadier aim with ranged weapons when hunting animals. Gameplay The entire game can be played with the touch screen, or a combination of buttons and the touch screen. The bottom screen shows an isometric view of the area as the player moves their character around the environment. It is also used in minigames for cooking, hunting, making furniture, fishing, shaking trees, and digging in the dirt, and other tasks. The top screen has three display modes. Mode one displays the overall health of both characters. This is shown by a total of four gauges. Three of them display stamina, hunger, and thirst. When one or more of those three reaches 0%, a health gauge begins to deplete which will result in that character's death upon reaching 0%. Mode two displays the map of the character's current location and includes the locations of both characters. Mode three is a picture of the island covered in fog, and the more the island is explored, the more the fog disappears until the whole island is revealed. Plot A short cut scene plays, showing the player character on a sinking ship. The player has the option to search their suitcase, the closet, or the table. They gain something from choosing one of them, but it can sometimes be unclear what. After the cut scene, the character (Amy or Jack, depending whom the player chooses at the start of the game) wakes up on the beach. (This part is similar to a cut scene in that the characters on the screen are moving and speaking without the player's control, but is illustrated just like the actual game, not like the cell-shaded opening. These \\"auto-scenes\\" occur whenever they hit an important turning point in the game.) The character says that he/she should look for survivors. At this point, game play begins and the player is free to wander the beach. At a certain point, they will be near enough to the partner character, and an auto-scene will introduce the two of them. Their first goals are to find food, shelter, and water. Once they find shelter in a nearby cave, the next few days are spent gathering enough food, water, and firewood to survive each day's labors. After several days of gameplay, the character will be able to start exploring their surroundings and finding the different areas of the island. Along the journey the character will fish, hunt game, build furniture, build a treehouse, develop several different tools, explore myriad cooking methods, and gather items from the beach, jungle, forest, and grasslands. They must also fight/avoid enemies like wolves, snakes, spiders, tigers, crocodiles, and gorillas. The eventual goal is, of course, rescue. The game provides several different ending scenarios that depend upon the actions the character takes during the game, such as being saved by a helicopter. If the character's health meter reaches zero, they will die and the game will be over. However, there are several ways to get rescued, such as by radio or helicopter, and there is a 365-day limit to the game. If the characters make it 365 days, the game automatically ends, and they are still on the island, but they will win and survive.

July 15th, 2009 History Nielluccio may have been introduced to Corsica by the Genoese while the island was under the rule of the Republic of Genoa. The exact origins of Nielluccio are disputed. While the grape is today known as primarily a French, or more specifically, Corsican grape,Decanter Grape Varieties-N Decanter's Grape Guide. Accessed: February 13th, 2011 ampelographers in the late 20th century began to believe that the grape was likely of Italian origins. Nielluccio's close genetic similarities to the indigenous Italian variety Sangiovese suggest that the two grapes are closely related. The grape was likely introduced to Corsica by the Genoese during their long rule over the island from the 13th century to the 18th century.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 129 Oxford University Press 1996 But this view is not universally accepted with some wine experts, such as Oz Clarke, believing that the grape is indigenous to Corsica.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 164 Harcourt Books 2001 Even Jancis Robinson believed once that Nielluccio was native to Corsica but her more recent works give support to the Genoese theory. The VIVC database list Nielluccio as a synonym of Sangiovese (pictured) instead of a separate grape variety. To further add to the mystery, there is some belief that the extremely close genetic similarities between Sangiovese and Nielluccio could mean that they are exactly the same grape (or rather a clone given Sangiovese's propensity for mutation). Indeed, the German Vitis International Variety Catalogue data base of known grape cultivars does not even give Nielluccio a separate entry, rather grouping it in as a synonym of Sangiovese.Nielluccio, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, Accessed: February 13th, 2011 Still many French and English wine texts, such as the Oxford Companion to Wine, list the grape as a separate entry but with a note describing its close similarities to Sangiovese.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 484 Oxford University Press 2006 While there is very little Nielluccio grown today in Italy, it is the third most widely planted variety in Corsica. Plantings declined for most of the 20th century as French immigrants from North Africa imported cuttings of varieties common in Algerian wine such as Carignan and Cinsaut. At the turn of the 21st century, as Corsican winemakers rediscovered \\"indigenous\\" Corsican varieties, interest in Nielluccio was on the upswing. Wine regions While Nielluccio is found throughout the island, the AOC regions of Patrimonio in the north (in purple) and Porto-Vecchio in the south (in blue) have the most plantings of the variety. Today Nielluccio is found almost exclusively on Corsica where it is the principal grape variety behind the AOC wines grown around Patrimonio in the north of the island. The grape's stronghold in the south is Porto-Vecchio, where it is usually blended. According to the AOC regulations for Patrimonio the grapes must be harvested to a yield no greater than 50 hectoliters/hectare and produce red wines with a minimum alcohol level of 12% and rosé a minimum of 11.5%. For Vin de Corse which includes the wines of Porto-Vecchio, the harvest yield requirements are the same but the red wines only need to reach an alcohol level of at least 11.5%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 91 & 109 Firefly Books 2004 Throughout Corsica, the variety is often blended with Sciacarello. Other varieties that Nielluccio is blended with for red blends and rosé wines include Barbarossa, Grenache, Vermentino, Cinsault and Carignan. While its plantings declined during the 20th century, updates to the encépagement for Corsica's AOCs have been allocating increasingly higher proportions of red and rosé blends to the use of Nielluccio. Along with Sciacarello and Grenache, Nielluccio must compose at least 50% of the blend for red wines labeled under the general Vin de Corse AOC. Viticulture As of 2000, there were 4000 acres (1,600 hectares) of Nielluccio planted on Corsica. The grape seems to thrive on vineyard soils that are primarily clay and limestone, particularly those of Patrimonio. The variety buds early and ripens late which puts it at risk for both spring time frosts and grape rots with rains during harvest. Wine Wine expert Oz Clarke describes Nielluccio as producing \\"robust and tannic\\" wines with moderate to high levels of acidity. Jancis Robinson describes the wines very alcoholic with low color pigmentation and \\"lacking guts\\" or structure. While the tannins and acidity in the grapes can help to produce fuller bodied wines with some aging potential, they can also make the wine come across as harsh depending on not only the physiological ripeness of the grapes at harvest but also how the winemaking process is carried out from maceration, fermentation, clarification and if the wine goes through any oak and filtering. Another method that is often used to balance Nielluccio's tannins and acidity is blending with Sciacarello a frequent partner. According to Jancis Robinson, it is the Nielluccio rosé from Patrimonio that tend to get the most critical acclaim from non-Corsicans of all the Nielluccio-based wines. Synonyms Over the centuries, Nielluccio and its wines have been known under a variety of synonyms including Niellucio, Niella, Nielluccia and Negretta.

Plot summary At the beginning of the story, protagonist Leonard Neeble attends a new school, Bat Masterson Junior High, where he is bullied by his classmates and neglected by the staff. At length, he is befriended by the title character, Alan Mendelsohn, and is thereafter happier and more capable. When Alan starts a school-wide quarrel over his claim to Martian ancestry, both are suspended from school for one week; during which, they meet Samuel Klugarsh, the owner of an occult bookstore, who sells them a kit meant to enable telepathy and psychokinesis. Having acquired these abilities, Leonard and Alan become bored with the few uses thereof; whereupon Klugarsh lets Leonard and Alan trade their mind-control kits for a course in \\"Hyperstellar Archaeology\\": the study of lost civilizations such as Atlantis and Lemuria, along with a copy of Yojimbo's Japanese-English Dictionary. Alan and Leonard are skeptical of the course's wild claims and predictions until they unexpectedly find an article in the text mentioning them both by name; when they follow its directions for interpreting Yojimbo's Japanese-English Dictionary, they become more capable of mind control experiments. Later, they and Klugarsh encounter the Dictionary's author, Clarence Yojimbo, who explains the real secret purpose of Yojimbo's Japanese-English Dictionary: when decoded by the proper key, it enables travel into parallel realities. According to the book's instructions, they enter the parallel Earth known as 'Waka-Waka', where the locals have established a ritualistic culture based on the drinking of fleegix, a beverage similar to hot chocolate; but have fallen under the control of the extraterrestrials 'Manny, Moe, and Jack', who control the supply of ingredients and whose rule is enforced by the deadly and invisible 'Wozzle'. Upon learning that the Wozzle only attacks in bright daylight or total darkness, Alan deduces that the Wozzle is actually the three criminals themselves, made invisible by their own psychokinesis. On this premise, he exposes them to the locals; whereupon he and Leonard use Klugarsh's telepathic technique to trick the trio into surrender. Here, they are commanded to withdraw from Waka-Waka to their own world of Nafsulia, by Rolzup, the Martian High Commissioner (himself invited by Alan). Alan and Leonard thereafter return to Earth; and soon afterward, Alan and his family emigrate to Mars. Leonard, after recovering from the shock of losing his best friend, assumes Alan's rôle of school trickster, studies independently, surprises the teachers during classes, and participates in an 'alternative' gym class based on hatha yoga. At the end of the book, he receives a letter from Alan, inviting him to Mars for a visit. left Availability Alan Mendelsohn is no longer in print as a separate work, but can be found in Pinkwater's omnibus 5 Novels (1997).

In that period Smith titled the story Tess's Mess.\\"The title, which I thought so cool at age seventeen, was Tess's Mess.\\" Described are the adventures of the title character, Wren, a female human orphan\\"Wren was an orphan.\\" whose best friend Tess is revealed to be the princess of a neighbouring country.Wren to the Rescue, Chapter 1 When Tess is kidnapped, Wren races to her rescue, making friends with students from a Magic School and learning about her own talents along the way. As part of her adventure, Wren is transformed bodily into a dog, and must decide whether to abandon her quest or try to turn her new shape to the advantage, at great risk of losing her human identity in the process. Plot summary Wren to the Rescue tells the story of an orphan girl who learns her best friend and purportedly fellow-orphan Tess, is in fact Teresa Rhisadel, princess and sole heiress of the neighbouring country of Meldrith. Tess proceeds to reveal her reason for remaining in hiding these many years: a curse. Namely, that of Andreus self-styled king of the nearby and ever-menacing nation of Senna Lirwan. In hopes that after twelve years Andreus has lost interest in his threat of revenge, and out of their ceaseless desire to be reunited with their daughter, Tess’s regal parents have sought her return home to Cantirmoor, capital of Meldrith, and have given Tess permission to invite Wren to accompany her. The plan backfires, however; when the girls are resting in Cantirmoor, the subterfuge of a Lirwani agent succeeds in abducting Tess. In the ensuing confusion, Wren is largely forgotten by the Cantirmoor officials. In frustration and wanting to help Tess, Wren slips away to the Cantirmoor Magic School, which already had been a waypoint of the trip to the palace from the orphanage. There Wren meets a magic prentice, Tyron, whose own plan to rescue Tess she joins. The pair rides to the Free Vale, a magically-protected Free Haven located south of Cantirmoor. Tyron intends to seek the aid of Idres Rhiscarlan, an inhabitant of the Free Vale, to rescue Tess. Idres’ reluctance due to past animosities between her and Tess’ father prevails, however, and the most she aids them is to discuss an approach to Andreus’ mountain- encircled land. At the next major stop on their journey of rescue, Horth Falls Town, Wren and Tyron encounter another prominent sympathizer to the Princess’ plight, Connor Shaltar, also technically a prince of another land, whose provisions breath new hope into the mission. The international scope of the conflict becomes clear as debate over a retaliatory invasion against Senna Lirwan heightens in Cantirmoor, ad interim Wren’s rescue party faces an escalating variety of threats as they make their way into, in to, and through, the border mountains. Once on the Lirwani side, some transmogrification (conferred in the rear dust-jacket text in most editions of the print volume of the story) is the only thing which saves Wren from the ambush-laden land’s defenses. This magical intervention proves to be provided by an unexpected ally, whose previous rescue of the rescuers went anonymous. Her compatriots being overrun and captured by the intensifying security measures on the planes of Andreus’ blighted land, Wren is able narrowly to escape, still being in animal form herself. Wren defies the directive of hastening home to be restored human before her mind is lost forever, instead electing to expand her rescue mission to include all of her friends now bound in the highest tower of Edrann. Through a daring combination of skilful infiltration on the part of Wren, and the ingenuity and magic ability of her friends, all six foreign detainees win free, though Wren’s dignity at the following feast in their honor leaves something to be desired. What shall happen next remains indefinite as this volume comes to a close, with two of the planet’s most prestigious magicians setting off on their own mission to bring Andreus’ educator to justice, while the former’s position in control of Senna Lirwan remains all-too-secure.

In 1890, it was opened directly next to Hügel Park, the estate of the industrialist Friedrich Alfred Krupp and the location of the Villa Hügel, which had been built twenty years earlier. The station is located on the Essen-Werden–Essen railway, which connects the Ruhr Valley Railway to Essen Hauptbahnhof.  History  Villa Hügel The station opened in 1890 so that guests of the Krupp family no longer had to travel from the existing stations of Werden or Rellinghausen-West (now Essen Stadtwald). However, it would also serve visitors to the scenic Ruhr valley, which was a place of recreation. In May 1889, Krupp requested the königlichen Eisenbahn- Direktion (Royal Railway Division) of Essen to establish Haltestelle Bredeney (Bredeney halt), which would be located between Werden and Rellinghausen stations at the 2.7 km mark (from Essen) on the Essen-Werden–Essen railway. The railway line was built in 1877 by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company, originally as a single-track line. The construction costs of Hügel station were met by Friedrich Krupp AG, with maintenance covered by the state. From 1896 a post office was housed in the station's ticket office for which the station master was responsible. However, this post office was only accessible by members of the Krupp family and employees of Hügel Park. It was listed until 1924 as an independent post office under the name of Krupp-Postamt (Krupp post office). Friedrich Alfred Krupp was personally granted a special permit from the beginning so that he could reach the platforms of Hügel station directly from the gate of Hügel Park. Additional special permits were issued in 1895 for other employees of the Krupp company, the Hügel operations and distant family members. These also gave permission to cross the railway tracks, so as to avoid the detour through the tunnel under Hügel station. State guests—including the Egyptian King Fuad I, in June 1929—were also granted direct access via the park's gate. On such occasions, Krupp identity cards were issued for entry to the platforms in order to keep out onlookers. Later, Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the issuance of identification cards after questions were raised about the Krupps’ right to issue the cards at a state-owned station. During the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, members of the Organization Heinz of Albert Leo Schlageter carried out attacks with bombs, including at Hügel station, to obstruct the transport of coal to France. In 1933, Hügel station became more important as a result of the construction of Lake Baldeney, so Deutsche Reichsbahn extended the station building and it was supplemented by a restaurant. This was able to accommodate the increased number of passengers.  Current situation  Entrance to the restaurant in 2007 The owner of the property is DB Station&Service;, which classified it as a category 5 station. The station building from 1890 offers a view of the Ruhr and—since its damming in 1933—Lake Baldeney. The restaurant is now operated as a Greek restaurant.  Operations  There were long-distance services on the track shortly after its opening from Düsseldorf via Essen to Soest and, in addition, there were some special trains for members of the Krupp family, as well as German and foreign rulers. The station is now served only by line S6 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn at 20-minute intervals.

Plot In a typical college in a typical Indian city, the hostel boys Madan Sharma (Aamir Khan) and his friends including Ranjeet Prakash (Ashutosh Gowariker) are a rowdy and troublesome lot. But on one day, when Madan and his friends find out there will not be a holiday for them on the day of Holi, the festival of colors, the boys decide not to attend classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student; the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated.

Early life Irving was born in New York City on August 15, 1766. William was the eldest surviving son of eleven children born to William Irving Sr. (1731–1807), originally of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (née Sanders) Irving (1738–1817). Among his surviving siblings were four brothers and three sisters, including: author and a member of the New York State Assembly Peter Irving, Ebenezer Irving, John Treat Irving, diplomat and author Washington Irving, Ann Irving (wife of Maj. Gen. Richard Dodge), Catherine Irving, and Sarah Irving. Career After completing preparatory studies, Irving engaged in mercantile pursuits. From 1787 to 1791, he was a fur trader with the Indians along the Mohawk River, residing at Johnstown and Caughnawaga. In 1793, he returned to New York City, married, and in 1814 was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Thirteenth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Egbert Benson.Jones, p. 120. He was reelected to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Congresses and served from January 22, 1814, to March 3, 1819. Irving, a close friend of James Kirke Paulding, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy under Martin Van Buren, supported the War of 1812. Irving contributed several essays and poems to Salmagundi, written primarily by Washington Irving and James Kirke Paulding.Jones, p. 57. Personal life In 1793, Irving was married to Julia Paulding (1768–1823), the daughter of William Paulding Sr. (one of the first members of the Provincial Congress), and sister of his friend James Kirke Paulding and William Paulding Jr. (a U.S. Representative, Mayor of New York City, and Adjutant General of New York).

Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . It can be distinguished from the related Acer capillipes (Japanese, ホソエカエデ hosoekaede), with which it often occurs, by the green petioles, the rufous hairs on the underside of the leaves (contrasting with the hairless or only thinly hairy A. capillipes leaves), and in flowering earlier in spring at the same time as the leaves appear. Description Fruiting raceme It is a small deciduous tree growing to a height of 8–15 m, with a trunk up to 40 cm diameter. The bark on young trees is smooth, olive-green with regular narrow vertical pale green to greyish stripes and small greyish lenticels; on old trees, it becomes rough and grey. The leaves are three-lobed (occasionally five-lobed with two additional small basal lobes), double serrated, 8–16 cm long and 6–16 cm broad, matt to sub- shiny dark green above, paler below with small tufts of rusty hair on the veins when young, becoming glabrous when mature; the petiole is greenish (rarely pinkish), 3–5 cm long. The leaves turn to bright orange or red in the autumn. The flowers are produced in racemes 10 cm long, each flower 8–10 mm diameter, with five yellow to greenish-yellow sepals and petals; it is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees. The fruit is a paired samara 2–3 cm long with rounded nutlets. Cultivation This is one of the most commonly planted snakebark maples, and is a hardy, fast grower. It does not display much variation as a species but a notable cultivar is 'Erythrocladum' with yellow-green in both its leaves and the stripes of its bark.

Olin Medal is an annual award that recognizes distinguished scientific accomplishment, leadership and service to chemistry by women chemists. The Award is offered by the American Chemical Society (ACS), and consists of a cash prize (US$5,000) and a medal. The medal was designed by Margaret Christian Grigor. Background Any individual may nominate a single eligible chemist in one year. Nominees must be a female citizen of the United States. The award was established by Francis Garvan and Mabel Brady Garvan in 1936 in honor of their daughter. It was initially an essay contest, that ran for seven years, as a memorial to their daughter (the American Chemical Society's Prize Essay Contest). It was solely funded by the Francis P. Garvan Medal Endowment from its establishment in 1936 until 1979. W. R. Grace & Co. assumed co-sponsorship of the award from 1979 to 1983. In 1984, Olin Corporation assumed co-sponsorship. Mabel Brady Garvan remained involved with the Award through 1967. The Garvan–Olin Award is the ACS' third- oldest award, and the first award established to honor women chemists.

It is often considered as one of the most beautiful mosques in the Asia Pacific. It is a place of worship for the Muslim community, a major historical site, and a famous tourist attraction of Brunei. It is named after Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei, who initiated its construction. The mosque serves as a symbol of the Islamic faith in Brunei. The building was completed in 1958 and is an example of modern Islamic architecture. The mosque unites Mughal architecture and Malay styles. Although attributed to Cav. Rodolfo Nolli, a Singapore based sculptor and decorative stonework contractor, it appears that it was first envisaged by His Majesty in 1952, with its design was developed by Kuala Lumpur based architectural firm Booty and Edwards, with Nolli acting as a contractor for its exterior and interior decorative stonework. Built in an artificial lagoon on the banks of the Brunei River at Kampong Ayer — the \\"village in the water\\" — the mosque has marble minarets and golden domes, a courtyard and is surrounded by a large number of trees and floral gardens. A bridge reaches across the lagoon to Kampong Ayer in the middle of the river. Another marble bridge leads to a structure in the lagoon meant as a replica of a 16th-century Sultan Bolkiah Mahligai Barge. The barge itself was completed in 1967 to commemorate the 1,400th anniversary of Nuzul Al-Quran (coming down of the Quran) and was used to stage the Quran reading competitions. The mosque's most recognizable feature, the main dome, is covered in pure gold. The mosque stands 52 m (171 ft) high. The main minaret is its tallest feature. In a unique way, it mixes Renaissance and Italian architectural styles. The minaret has an elevator to the top, where a visitor can enjoy a panoramic view of the city. The interior of the mosque is for prayer only, with features such as stained glass windows, arches, semi-domes and marble columns. Nearly all the material used for the building were imported from abroad: the marble from Italy, the granite from Shanghai, the crystal chandeliers from England, and the carpets from Saudi Arabia.

In their live performances, band members play characters in an other-worldly pageantry, wearing elaborate homemade costumes and performing on a stage decorated with drawings and set pieces, all covered in day-glo paint. The band has toured Europe, Japan, and North America. Band Membership Caroliner's members are anonymous, but use aliases (Obsidian Skeleton, The Sickwood Adventure, and Cottypearile Weddingforke).Identity Theory: Random Truths About Caroliner The aliases are only used during interviews with the band; no credits appear on any Caroliner records. In her autobiography, cartoonist Dame Darcy writes about her membership in the band in the late 1980s/early 1990s.Dame Darcy, Hi Jax & Hi Jinx (Feral House, 2018), pp. 99-107. Band Name The Caroliner band name changes from album to album, and tour to tour. For instance, the band's name on their 1990 album I'm Armed With Quarts of Blood is Caroliner Rainbow Stewed Angel Skins, whereas on 1995's Sell Heal Holler the band is called Caroliner Rainbow Customary Relaxation Of The Shale. The reason for this is unknown but could be connected to personnel changes within the band. When referring to the band as a whole, the Caroliner name stands alone (rather than the oft-used 'Caroliner Rainbow'). Press Jamie Rake, in Sound Choice, described Caroliner's music as follows: : \\"Caroliner is the sound of atrophy, the noise of salvation and damnation's collision in a parallel dimension to purgatory, the random rumbling of the bowels of the universe turned inside out to become a semblance of music complete with lyrical vantage points so convolutedly arcane to make comprehending them impossible, save for the few gnostically inclined aspirants bent in similar psychic permutations.\\" Alex Ross of The New Yorker noted: : \\"On top of the visual extravagance, Caroliner has somehow forged an original musical style. The songs typically fuse together a grinding, relentless bass line, country-ish banjo strummings, spastic vocals ranging across several octaves, a wheezing organ drone, and screeching violin tremolos. Despite the splintered aesthetic, a lumbering grandeur gathers ...... Space does not permit a description of the lyrics, which purport to interpret the prophecies of a 19th-century Wisconsin cow.\\" Alex Ross: The Rest Is Noise In May, 2011, the band received notice on the Fox network cable program \\"Red Eye,\\" where the host, Greg Gutfeld, lauded the group's work (between 9 and 13 minutes into the clip cited), calling it \\"brilliant\\" and \\"violently obscure.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zvu9BM3bFY  Discography  To date the band has released 13 full-length albums. Their first two albums were released and/or distributed by Subterranean Records. The following five albums were released by Nuf Sed. Since 1995, all of Caroliner's albums have been self-released by BullsHit. Caroliner's music has also appeared on various 7\\" singles, EPs, split releases, and compilations. Caroliner's album covers are assembled by hand. Drawings and calligraphy are screen-printed or photocopied onto various materials, which are then glued onto a makeshift record sleeve. Sleeve materials vary (two copies of the same record will seldom be identical), and have included fabric, diaper disposal bags, old record sleeves (spray-painted beyond recognition) and pizza boxes.

The new network, CTV: The Comedy Network, premiered on April 1, 1991, but rebranded to Comedy Central on June 1, 1991. Most of the Comedy Channel's original programs were produced in the HBO Downtown Studios on East 23rd Street in Manhattan.  Programming  The format prior to the merger included several original and unconventional programs such as Onion World with Rich Hall and Mystery Science Theater 3000, as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by stand-up comedians, including The Sweet Life with Rachel Sweet; Tommy Sledge, Private Eye; Alan King: Inside the Comedy Mind; Night After Night with Allan Havey; Sports Monster; and The Higgins Boys and Gruber, the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television serials like Supercar, Clutch Cargo, and Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp. Commercial breaks often included \\"Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey,\\" which would later be featured on Saturday Night Live.  Standard format  The standard format for these shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Young Frankenstein and Kentucky Fried Movie, presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without \\"host segments\\" were dubbed Short Attention Span Theater. In 1990, hosts under this title, Jon Stewart and Patty Rosborough, were introduced. Comedian Marc Maron also hosted the series, and was one of the few shows that survived the network merger. In the final months before the merger, the channel developed an eight-hour programming block that was shown three times during a 24-hour period, including such things as reruns of Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Body & Soul’s 1989 debut single \\"Dance to the Drummer’s Beat\\", released on Los Angeles-based record label, heavily sampled the Herman Kelly and Life song of the same name. Its b-side, \\"Hi-Powered\\", was produced by Def Jef. The same year another track produced by Def Jef would be released: \\"We Can Do This\\", on the label showcase This Is Delicious – Eat to the Beat. Body & Soul's greatest recording would apparently be their last—as part of the Dr. Dre-produced West Coast Rap All-Stars and their 1990 posse cut, \\"We’re All in the Same Gang\\", which earned them a Grammy Award nomination. In 1992, Barnes hosted the hip-hop special Sisters in the Name of Rap, a 75-minute revue of live performances taped at the Ritz in New York. The show featured an all-female line up with such artists as Queen Latifah and MC Lyte. In 2017, she appeared in the second episode of the TV series The Defiant Ones. Dr. Dre incident An episode in 1990 combined interviews with N.W.A and Ice Cube, shortly after N.W.A had dissed Ice Cube with their 100 Miles and Runnin' album. The clips are shown in part in episode 2 of The Defiant Ones. Dee Barnes said in the episode that there was a bad energy in the interview with N.W.A and every answer seemed to involve a diss to Ice Cube. In production, this was then combined with Barnes's interview with Ice Cube in which he dissed N.W.A and also cruelly mimicked The DOC's voice, shortly after a near-fatal accident. This caused great offence to Dr. Dre, who was a close friend of The DOC. On January 27, 1991, Dr. Dre encountered Barnes at a record release party in Hollywood. According to Barnes: N.W.A. promoter Doug Young claims that he attempted to intervene to restrain Dr. Dre, but that he was punched in the mouth by Dr. Dre's bodyguard.Rap Reviews editorial: Why Dr. Dre Can't Be Given a Pass on Dee Barnes The other members of N.W.A. defended Dr. Dre. N.W.A.’s MC Ren later said \\"bitch deserved it\\" and Eazy-E echoed with \\"yeah, bitch had it coming\\". As Dr. Dre explained the incident: \\"People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fuck with me, I’m gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain’t nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain’t no big thing—I just threw her through a door.\\" Barnes sued in February 1991, telling reporter Alan Light: \\"They’ve grown up with the mentality that it’s okay to hit women, especially black women. Now there’s a lot of kids listening and thinking it’s okay to hit women who get out of line.\\" In February, Barnes filed assault charges and brought a $22.75 million lawsuit against Dr. Dre, who pleaded no contest to the assault. He was fined $2,500, placed on two years’ probation, and ordered to perform 240 hours of community service and produce an anti-violence public service announcement.Noel, Peter. 1998. \\"Revenge of the Mad Rappers.\\" The Village Voice.

Jerry Heller, then manager of N.W.A, called the incident \\"disgraceful\\" in his book and said that he was \\"left to clean up the mess\\" afterward. He claimed that Dr. Dre was generally non- violent and that the attack was a result of excess drinking. The New York rapper Tim Dog threatened Dr. Dre on the song Fuck Compton with the lyrics Dre, beating on Dee from Pump It Up / Step to the Dog and get fucked up.

This Italian word is derived from the Latin poculum, a drinking-vessel, perhaps through the Spanish búcaro, or the Portuguese púcaro.Nicola Zingarelli, Vocabolario della Lingua Italiana, 2011. The Spanish word búcaro also means an odorous kind of clay formerly chewed by women, and from which those vessels were made. (María Moliner, Diccionario del uso del Español, 2007). Regarded as the \\"national\\" pottery of ancient Etruria, bucchero ware is distinguished by its black fabric as well as glossy, black surface achieved through the unique \\"reduction\\" method in which it was fired. After the leather-hard unfired ware was arranged in the kiln and the fire started, the vent holes were closed, thus reducing the supply of oxygen required in a normal kiln firing. In the smoke-filled atmosphere of the kiln, the oxygen-starved flames drew oxygen molecules from the iron oxide of the pottery. This process caused the fabric of the clay to change color from its natural red to black. Thus, in contrast to the black- glazed Campanian ware of the Greek colonists in southern Italy, the lustrous, shiny, black surface of many bucchero pots was achieved by diligent burnishing (polishing) or, occasionally, through the application of a thin slip (clay emulsion). Etymology The term Bucchero derives from the Portuguese word búcaro, meaning \\"odorous clay\\", because this type of pottery was reputed to emit a special odor. In the 18th and 19th century in Europe a lot of interest was shown for a particular type Pre-Columbian pottery in a black color. These ceramics were therefore shipped in large numbers from South America to Europe, where they were traded and were imitated. At the same time, in Italy, 'etruscheria' (Etruscan-style artefacts) was in large demand and major digs were organized in Tuscany and Umbria in the quest for Etruscan antiquities. Because of the similarities with the popular South American ceramics, the striking black pottery that was found in Etruscan tombs was called 'bucchero'. This Italianate form became established in archaeological terminology and even today the designation 'bucchero' is still common in the scientific literature. Development Oinochoe from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (inv. 91.1.454) The first appearance of a ceramic type that can clearly be classified as bucchero occurred around 675 BCE at the coastal community of Caere (the modern-day Cerveteri), with somewhat later centers of production to be found at Veii and Tarquinia, both cities, like Caere, located in the southern part of the Etruscan heartland. Bucchero ware would seem to have been the natural sequel to the impasto pottery associated with the earlier Villanovan culture from which the Etruscan civilization, itself, had evolved. Etruscan pottery is distinguished from Villanovan impasto by the more sophisticated processing of the clays used which were finely levigated to remove the traces of grit common in the earlier pottery, by its being uniformly turned on a potter's wheel, by its carbonized black fabric in contrast to the brown or tan color found in impasto pottery. Although the shapes of Villanovan pots provided the basics for the Etruscan potters, they added new types and forms largely inspired through intensified trade with the more advanced cultures at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, in particular the areas of Cyprus, Syria, and Phoenicia, as well as Egypt. Many of the new, exotic shapes were in imitation of the metalwares imported from these cultures. The potters of Etruria were able to offer their customers a locally produced and less-expensive ceramic equivalent to the desirable but costly metal products arriving from the east. Some of the Etruscan potshops even carried metalware imitation to the point of covering the surface of bucchero vessels with thin sheets of silver in an attempt to visually duplicate the luxurious imports. Styles The Orientalizing manner is most apparent in the earliest phase of bucchero production which also is distinguished by the remarkable thinness of the walls of the vessels. Known as bucchero sottile, or delicate bucchero, this ware represents a technical achievement elevating the potters who turned them to the ranks of the very finest ceramicists. So thin-walled are some of bucchero sottile vessels (in some cases, less than 2mm in thickness), such as the products of the Cornacchiola Tomb Potter of Caere, that it is probable that they were turned specifically for funereal purposes rather than for general household use. On the other hand, the broad distribution of bucchero sherds at ancient Caere, Veii, and Tarquinia and at other area sites points to less extreme examples of bucchero sottile as having had a more practical function in the daily life of the Etruscans. High-legged bucchero chalice with relief decoration, early 6th century BC (Louvre) During the Archaic period, the ever-increasing impact of the Greek aesthetic on Etruscan culture can be noted in the influence of Greek vase shapes on the design choices of the bucchero potters. Etruscan potters, however, made their own contributions to the Hellenic ceramic vocabulary by adding the form of the two-handled drinking cup, the kantharos, and that of the related single-handled cup, the kyathos, to the list of Greek vase types. The Nikosthenic amphora with its wide, flat handles was yet another example of Greek potters looking to Etruscan prototypes. The bucchero wares of Etruria even offered some export competition to Greek pottery. In the production of bucchero sottile, the shape of the pot held pride of place, with surface decoration playing a supporting role. When decoration was used, it was usually limited to enhancing the profile of a chalice, a kantharos, or a kyathos with a row of crisply defined hook notches at the point of carination. The bowl of an oinochoe (pitcher) might be emphasized by closely spaced vertical lines incised into the soft clay before firing. Further decoration could be added before the green ware was loaded into the kiln by using a toothed wheel or a comb-like instrument to create rows of dots arranged in fan patterns. On later examples a roller with recessed reliefs was used to transfer figures of deities or even narratives to the surface of the vessel. During the Orientalizing period and on into the Archaic, bucchero sottile production continued but gradually lost its unique character as Etruria became increasingly Hellenized. As Rome began to nibble away at the territories of southern Etruria, centers for producing bucchero shifted northwards to the cities of Chiusi and Vulci. There, during the Classical period, potters put their stamp upon the bucchero tradition by introducing a new variety of the ceramic known as bucchero pesante, or heavy bucchero. In this final phase in the history of bucchero pottery, vessel walls become thicker and proportions squatter. The decoration of bucchero pesante ware typically consisted of mold- formed figures applied to the still-damp surface of the pot. By the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E., in part due to the growing availability of the elegant pottery of Greece, the demand for native bucchero ware was in a steep decline. Bucchero no longer was exported and, at home, consumers preferred the colorful pottery of the Greek artisans with their narrative and figurative panels. Etruscan potters now devoted their attention to the production of provincial imitations of Greek red-figure vases.

Huber (born 15 December 1939) is a German composer. Education Huber was born in Passau. From 1958 to 1962 he studied music education at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München and subsequently composition with Franz Xaver Lehner and Günter Bialas. He pursued his education further with Josef Anton Riedl, Karlheinz Stockhausen and, above all, with Luigi Nono. From 1974 until his retirement in 2003 Huber was Professor of Composition at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen . Style and influences Riedl and Schnebel inspired Huber's vocal and linguistic experiments. Riedl in particular encouraged Huber's radical tendencies . His treatment of musical material was most strongly formed by his contact with Stockhausen, while Nono inspired in him an acute historical and political (Marxist) awareness, particularly evident in his second compositional phase, beginning around 1969 . Huber took part in Stockhausen's composition project Ensemble at the 1967 Darmstädter Ferienkurse, an experience that gave him an appreciation of the potential for improvisation—a factor that marks not only his compositions for conventional forces, but also his mixed- and multi-media experiments. Stockhausen's influence can also be seen in Huber's exploitation of space and the incorporation of extraneous elements, such as vocal utterances in instrumental music, as a means of heightening expression. His period of study with Luigi Nono in 1967–68 was even more influential on Huber. Nono encouraged Huber to seek a more thorough-going means of eradicating tonality, through a study of psychology in order better to understand human responses .

Based on a story by George Owen and Tom Reed, the film is about an ambitious coal miner who values wealth and power in the Pittsburgh steel industry over his friends, lovers, and ideals, only to find himself deserted and alone at the top. When his fortune crumbles around him, he discovers that fate offers him an unexpected second chance. Filmed partially on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the film co- stars Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame in a rare dramatic role. Dietrich, Scott, and Wayne also made The Spoilers together that same year. Scott received top billing over Wayne in both films despite the fact that Wayne's roles were larger and more important (though this may have been a contractual obligation, as Scott had been a star for rather longer than Wayne had been). Plot Here John Wayne plays a coal miner with ambitions, Pittsburgh Markham. His self-confidence manifests itself in a lack of consideration for others. He's usually friendly but he makes use of people; to promote a loan, to con a new suit out of a tailor, to raise some money from a boxing match—pushing his best friend, Cash Evans (Randolph Scott) into the ring. When he meets Josie Winters (Marlene Dietrich), he starts calling her \\"Countess\\" because of the impression she makes on him, although she reveals that she comes from the same kind of humble coal-mining background as himself. Josie remains somewhat unimpressed by his big ideas but when she dares him to quit his job in the mine he does so—and tenders Cash's resignation as well. He interests a steel mill owner in a supply of cut-price coke and, needing the steel mill owner's signature on a contract to persuade the mine-owner to supply the coke, he forges it himself. Flushed with success, he starts talking of helping to improve the lot of the men he used to work with, but his first taste of big business goes to his head. He marries the steel mill owner's daughter much to Josie's dismay but soon feels out of his depth at the wedding reception and other formal gatherings. As Pittsburgh follows his lonely path to further heights of financial wizardry and big business success, his old ideals fall by the wayside. He puts his father-in-law out of the business and he betrays the men that he had promised to help. He even puts a stop to research into a new medicine to be developed from coal tar to relieve world suffering because it doesn't show any profit. Cash draws the line and demands to be let out of his partnership with Pittsburgh. When the men stage a revolt against Pittsburgh in the mine, he goes down to tackle them singlehanded, as bold and confident as ever, and Cash follows to intercede before trouble can break out, putting the dispute on a personal level between him and Pittsburgh and turning it into a fistfight. This marks the turning point of Pittsburgh's career. His success goes sour, Cash abandons him, his wife walks out and Josie is badly hurt in a mine accident. He is all alone. He now goes in reverse gear and tries to win friends by putting right his past mistakes. Cash and Josie marry and Pittsburgh's business folds up under him. Only now does he feel genuinely repentant but it is too late. As World War II engages America, he goes to work for Cash's new company under an assumed name, starting at the bottom. Soon his ideas for improving output command Cash's attention and when the new employee comes to meet the boss only Josie prevents them from quarreling bitterly, giving the film a patriotic message that the important thing at this time of war is \\"devotion to our country.\\" With the three united as friends again it remains for Pittsburgh to make one small assertion of his old arrogance. Given the job of production manager by Cash, he upgrades himself to being his partner.

She was conferred the highest award by the Sierra Club, The John Muir Award, in 1991. She was presented the highest award by the Wilderness Society, The Robert Marshall Award, in 1998. Early life Celia M. Hunter was born in 1919 in Washington state and was raised a Quaker on a small farm during the Great Depression. Being raised a Quaker instilled values in her that she carried throughout her life . Celia's values also instilled in her the confidence to follow her dreams, regardless of whether they were conventional paths for women. Environmentalist and conservationist are two words that are now strongly associated with Hunter, however when she first came to Alaska, she did not consider herself a conservationist or environmentalist. Military service as a pilot Hunter trained as a pilot and eventually became a pilot during World War II, as a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, also known as the WASPs, graduating with class 43-W5. Hunter flew planes from the factories to training centers and ports of embarkation throughout the USA. She successfully completed each upgrading until she was qualified to fly the most sophisticated fighter planes in the US military. The US Ferrying Division ruled that women should not be allowed to ferry military fighter planes any farther north than Great Falls, Montana. \\"We ferried them from factories clear across the US, but 'sorry, gals, turn them over to the men here' and they got to fly them on the Northwest Staging Route through Edmonton, Fort Nelson, Watson Lake, and Whitehorse to Fairbanks,\\" Hunter told students at Linfield College during a 1997 speech. Two years later, Hunter and her good friend and fellow WASP, Ginny Hill Wood, decided that they would get to Fairbanks on their own, just to see what their male colleagues had been talking about. They made a deal with an Alaskan pilot who was in Seattle to fly two of his planes to Fairbanks. It took 27 days to fly from Seattle to Fairbanks, even though the total flying time added up to only 30 hours. Wood's plane had unairworthy fabric and no heat - the women nicknamed it \\"Li'l Igloo.\\" The two women arrived in Fairbanks on January 1, 1947 in the midst of a thick snowstorm. The temperature was almost and the only scheduled airline could not fly in those temperatures. Finding themselves stranded, Hunter and Wood secured jobs in a start-up travel agency. Hunter served as a flight attendant on the first-ever tourist trips to Kotzebue and Nome and planned the first sightseeing tours of Fairbanks. In autumn 1947, Hunter enrolled in the University of Stockholm in a special course designed for American GI students. After a semester in Sweden, Hunter and Wood spent ten months bicycling through war-torn Europe and eventually hitchhiked on tankers back to the United States, where they returned to Alaska. Camp Denali Hunter and Wood, together with Wood's husband, decided to start Camp Denali, which was planned to be similar to the hut systems in Europe, with simple accommodations coupled with outdoor activities. The threesome staked out a Trade and Manufacturing Site claim under the Homestead Act along the then-western boundary of Denali National Park, with a magnificent view of Mount McKinley, and opened for business in 1952. Their management philosophy was simple, \\"to create a setting in which our guests, staff, and even casual visitors would be aware of the wonders of the natural world that surrounded us.\\" Camp Denali's management closely reflected Hunter's philosophy on life. \\"We specialized in providing healthy, sustaining meals, with fresh baked bread and pastries, and we refused to handle either soft drinks or beer in our small store because we didn't want to see the throw-away cans littering the roadsides,\\" Celia once remarked. Camp Denali was sold in 1975 and now lies within Denali National Park. As their business grew, so did their deep respect and love for the natural world and they found themselves increasingly involved in Alaska's issues. When Celia and Ginny first arrived in Alaska, it was a Territory with approximately 180,000 people. \\"Flying across bush Alaska, the entire landscape was a seamless whole, unmarred by man-made boundaries. Alaskans assumed it would always be like this, and they resisted strenuously the setting aside of particular lands to protect them.\\" Alaska was changing rapidly before their eyes and they realized it was going to take a lot of work to protect the Alaskan wild-lands they loved. The trip that Olaus and Mardy Murie made in 1956 to the Sheenjek River at Lost and Lobo Lakes in the foothills of the Brooks Range was the catalyst that started the conservation movement in Alaska. Mardy and Olaus, a naturalist and wildlife biologist well known for his work in Alaska, dreamed of protecting a large area of the Arctic that extended from the Arctic Ocean, across the Brooks Range, and down into the boreal forest on the opposite side. After their trip, Olaus proposed the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Range to protect an ecosystem large enough to support the great Porcupine River caribou herd and other large populations of wildlife. Celia met the Muries on one of their trips through Fairbanks. \\"We really supported very strongly what they were trying to do. Olaus went home and drew lines on the map and we started fighting for setting aside the area,\\" said Celia. Soon the group of staunch supporters realized that protecting the Arctic Range was going to be harder than expected. Setting aside the Range was virtually impossible to do through Congress, because the congressional delegation of Alaska was adamantly opposed to any withdrawals of land for conservation purposes. Celia and others began fighting for the Range unofficially until they decided they would need to form an organization in order to be most effective. The Alaska Conservation Society (ACS), Alaska's first statewide conservation organization, was formed in 1960, proving a venue for Celia and others to testify on behalf of the Arctic National Wildlife Range(ANWR). Unfortunately, support for the ANWR came primarily from congressional delegates and other conservationists outside of Alaska, and there was nothing that got the Alaskan delegation more riled up than a bunch of outsiders coming in and telling Alaska how to manage its resources. Celia remarked, \\"OK, if you don't want to listen to people from Outside, you better listen to us.\\" Voting members of ACS were required to be Alaskan residents. Despite strong opposition from Alaska's senators and lone congressman, a presidential proclamation by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton created the Wildlife Range shortly before Eisenhower left office in 1960. Following this success, ACS continued to serve as a vehicle through which Alaskans could be heard on conservation issues. Celia acted as the executive secretary of ACS for the next 12 years. Death and afterward Celia died on December 1, 2001 at age 82. She had been up late that night writing letters to Congressmen in support of protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling. Her life spanned an important part of Alaska's history. Celia was a cornerstone of the conservation movement in Alaska, opening minds and halting disasters with unwavering strength and persistence. Celia's list of accomplishments and her lasting legacy are affirmations that she was an effective leader for over 50 years. Celia was quoted that you just have to keep a fire in your stomach and you just go for it, and when you do, you can make a tremendous difference. Her leadership style included: being a good listener, lead by example, think of the bigger picture, be engaged in the moment, persevere, be honest, passionate, respectful, humble, optimistic, human, compassionate, remain curious, credible, communicate well, be part of the community, keep a balance, be a mentor, stay youthful, have a sense of humor. Never stop learning. Although Celia graduated high school in 1936, served in the Women Air Force in 1943, she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Botany in 1964 with a minor in Economics and Anthropology from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Awards In 1991 Celia Hunter was conferred the highest award by the Sierra Club, The John Muir Award, for a lifetime of dedicated conservation work, a distinguished record of achievement in national or international conservation causes. In 1998, Celia Hunter was presented the highest award by the Wilderness Society, The Robert Marshall Award, for her long-term service to and notable influence upon conservation and the fostering of an American land ethic. In 2001, The Alaska Conservation Foundation presented Celia Hunter and Ginny Wood with the first ever Lifetime Achievement Award, the cornerstone of the Alaska Conservation Hall of Fame. The ACF has an endowment fund named for Celia M. Hunter, that educates interested, young people for an environmental career. Conservation legacy Celia started the Alaska Conservation Foundation in 1980. Hunter served on the board of trustees for more than 18 years, growing the foundation, inspiring the next generation, and protecting Alaskan wilderness. Shortly before her death, Hunter said \\"Change is possible, but you have to put your energy into it. You can’t expect me, I’m past 80, to be the mover and the shaker of this, but people like you are. And you’re going to have to bite the bullet and really decide what kind of world you want to live in.\\" (alaskaconservation.org). Soon after its formation, ACS found itself opposing two other major battles: Rampart Dam and Project Chariot. The first battle was over the proposal to build a dam on the Yukon River at a location known as The Ramparts. The Rampart Dam would have created a lake long and affected climates and ecosystems clear into the Yukon Territories. Also, the lake would have submerged numerous small villages and individual cabins in the area, inundated millions of acres of rich waterfowl and wildlife habitat, and displaced large numbers of mammal populations. Celia, Ginny and others involved with ACS worked hard to expose the shortcomings of the proposal. Rampart Dam would have theoretically produced vast quantities of electrical power and involved the construction of a large aluminum processing complex in Southcentral Alaska to take advantage of the cheap power. Debates took place in Fairbanks and were largely attended by the public. Ginny remembers Celia talking about the economics of the project and not just about saving moose and ducks, to the great surprise of the industrymen against whom she debated. By doing her homework, Celia was successful in exposing common sense complications and problems with the proposal. The second battle was known as Project Chariot, a proposal that involved blasting using a nuclear bomb to blast a harbor out of the northwest Arctic coast south of Pt. Hope. Dr. Edward Teller and others from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had come to Alaska to convince residents that atomic power in the Arctic would bring a wealth of benefits to the state. He toured the state and convinced the Alaskan delegation and the Anchorage and Fairbanks Chambers of Commerce of the economic benefits that would result from a permanently open port at Point Hope. Academics at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks were not so easily convinced. The University's professors demanded to know how Dr. Teller and the AEC would identify the impacts of a nuclear explosion with no pre-blast knowledge of the land and its inhabitants. That was how they got the first Environmental Impact Statement investigation! This was ten years before NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) became law under President Nixon. What was found really pulled the rug out from under the project, because it was one of the richest areas in Alaska. As it turned out, AEC was more interested in experimenting with the blasts and with the radioactive fallout than Alaska's economic and social well-being. The ACS became involved, and in the March 1961 issue of the ACS News Bulletin explored the broader significance of Project Chariot. Data from dedicated University scientists like Dr. Leslie Viereck, Don Foote, and Dr. William Pruitt provided indisputable evidence for their case. Celia wrote, \\"The consequences were laid out insofar as they could be known or calculated, and the price Alaska might have to pay in terms of having vast areas so contaminated they could not be utilized, was forecast.\\" The ACS Bulletin was distributed widely in Washington, DC and reprinted through other organizations such as the Sierra Club. Ginny Wood remembers the effectiveness of the networking: it soon brought the issue to a national audience. Seeing the Sierra Club briefings, Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall became puzzled as to why the AEC did not go through him on the project and asked to be sent all the information that the Sierra Club was receiving. As a result, ACS developed a direct line to the head of the Department of the Interior, effectively undermining Edward Teller and the AEC. While Project Chariot was never explicitly canceled and the AEC never admitted that the project was completely misguided and irresponsible, the proposal ceased to gain momentum. The truth of the devastation Project Chariot could have caused was finally realized. \\"This is how close the US and Alaska came to having their own Chernobyl catastrophe and the perpetrators of the plot were government employees of the AEC and the Lawrence Radiation Lab - people so intent on their own narrow goals that they would willingly have sacrificed everything within northern Alaska to achieve them,\\" Celia explained. Disaster was not entirely averted. The battle that Celia thought was being played out in the open was being played behind closed doors, as well. Before the AEC left Alaska, they imported several tons of radioactive waste and buried it in the vicinity of the proposed harbor site to examine how it disseminated through the ecosystem. Celia talked about the findings in an interview with Hilary Hilscher, \\"they were turned down; they realized that they couldn't go ahead and make a nuclear blast because people were already loaded to the gills with the radioactivity. So what did they do but import a bunch of it and bury it and didn't tell anybody and now, 33 years later, it suddenly comes to light. I think those people were absolutely dastardly.\\" ACS took on many other battles utilizing both reactive and proactive strategies to protect Alaska's environment. They were instrumental in removing bounties on wolves, a fight that lasted nearly a decade. ACS fought the Susitna Dam project, similar to the Rampart Dam. They worked on community projects preserving open spaces in Fairbanks, and were proponents of trail systems as well as alternative transportation. Residents in many Alaskan communities started local ACS chapters to fight issues in their own backyards. ACS chapters worked on their own issues and communicated through the News Bulletin. The organization grew and worked tirelessly for 20 years before finally dissolving. Ginny, Celia and others realized they no longer had the resources to run such a large organization. They ended the ACS and divided the money up for the Alaska Center for the Environment (ACE), Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC), and The Northern Alaska Environment Council (NAEC.) The women had established a strong conservation movement throughout Alaska to carry on with needed work. In 1969 Celia was offered a position on the Governing Council of the Wilderness Society, in 1976 she was made president and later executive director; she was the first female to head a national environmental organization. In 1972, Celia was nominated by Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B. Morton to sit on the joint Federal State Land Use Planning Commission where she articulated the environmentalists' viewpoint. She worked with the Commission until it dissolved in 1980 with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands and Conservation Act. Even with her notoriety, Celia did not stop looking for ways to further conservation in Alaska. In 1980, Celia and Denny Wilcher started the Alaska Conservation Foundation (ACF) to bring more resources to the conservation movement in Alaska and to continue the statewide networking that had been started with ACS. Celia served on the ACF Board of Trustees for over 18 years. She served on innumerable other boards including Alaska Natural History Assn., Nature Conservancy, Trustees for Alaska, and The Wilderness Society. Beginning in 1979, Celia contributed a regular column to the Fairbanks Daily News Miner offering an alternative voice with environmental and liberal themes to the community. In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands and Conservation Act (ANILCA) was passed, doubling the size of the Arctic National Wildlife Range and renaming it the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mentorship In the mid and late 1970s, while serving on the Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission for Alaska (headquartered in Anchorage), Celia Hunter became a magnet for mentoring young women arriving in Alaska from the southern states in search of both adventure and participation in one of America's landmark conservation episodes: the apportionment of then-undesignated federal lands into forms with protected status (national parks and national monuments) versus unprotected status (United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management), culminating in Congressional passage in 1980 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Celia was also an avid outdoor enthusiast. She skied, hiked, and kayaked until her death. References Books *Hammond, Jay.

The film is based on Chester Himes' novel of the same name. The opening theme, \\"Ain't Now But It's Gonna Be\\" was written by Ossie Davis and performed by Melba Moore. It was followed two years later by the sequel Come Back, Charleston Blue. Plot \\"Reverend\\" Deke O'Malley, a conman, is selling shares at a Harlem rally, for the purchase of a Back-to- Africa movement ship to be called The Black Beauty. During the rally, several masked gunmen jump out of a meat truck and steal $87,000 in donated cash from the back of an armored car. Two Harlem detectives, Gravedigger Jones and \\"Coffin\\" Ed Johnson chase the car, and a bale of cotton falls out of the vehicle, unremarked at the time. Uncle Budd, a scavenger, finds the bale of cotton and sells it for $25 to a junk dealer, but later buys it back for $30. There is a reward out for the $87,000, and Gravedigger and Coffin deduce that the money was probably hidden inside the bale which had fallen out of the getaway vehicle during the chase. After accusing Reverend O’Malley of stealing the money and taking him captive, Detectives Jones and Johnson are able to blackmail Tom, a mob leader, to give them $87,000 - to be restored to the original donors - after discovering that Uncle Budd has run off with the stolen money and emigrated to Ghana, to live in retirement with his ill-gotten gains.

Cotton Comes to Harlem employed many local residents as extras and crew in the Harlem neighborhood where it was filmed. This helped to put a positive spotlight on Harlem, which at the time was ravaged with crime. Seeing that the film would be shot in Harlem, featuring large crowd scenes, such as riots and rallies, John Shabazz and the Black Citizens Patrol volunteered to control the scenes with their experience in keeping out unwanted spectators and policing traffic. The Black Citizens Patrol’s purpose was to protect the black community from itself, so they made themselves available at all times, even operating as an escort service.UA film 'cotton comes to harlem' in the ghetto. (1969, Nov 08). Chicago Daily Defender (Big Weekend Edition) (1966-1973) The film saw the debut of Calvin Lockhart, Judy Pace, and Cleavon Little. Another debuted was Redd Foxx, already well-known as a veteran night club comic, leading him to be considered for the TV Show Sanford and Son. Cambridge also starred as a white man who turns black in the motion picture comedy Watermelon Man, which opened the same day as Cotton Comes to Harlem. The film’s inspirational opening theme song, “Ain’t Now But It’s Gonna Be,” was written by Ossie Davis and performed by Melba Moore, who at the time, was also starring in the hit Broadway musical, Purlie!  Themes  Cotton Comes to Harlem is hailed by many as the first blaxploitation film, although others felt that it was merely an action comedy film, and did not exploit blacks. Detectives Gravedigger and Coffin Ed do not always follow the rules. They are not necessarily fighting to protect the rule of law, but they try to protect their people from racist attitudes. Cotton Comes to Harlem also demonstrates Black Power by depicting tools such as self-determination. The detectives work throughout the movie to prove that the black community was being taken advantage of, and by the end of the film, they gain the respect of white officers and are able to demand $87,000 from Calhoun. Reception Cotton Comes to Harlem was released in theaters on May 26, 1970. Critical response Film critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"'Balloons, fans, feathers—they're all out of style,' says the racially aware exotic dancer preparing her act for Harlem's Apollo Theater. 'They don't say a thing about my people!' [...] However, like the dancer's balloons, fans and feathers, the movie's stick-ups, shootouts, chases, murders and wisecracks say little about the Black Experience except that Ossie Davis, when given the opportunity, can turn out a ghetto comedy- melodrama that is almost as cold and witless as Gordon Douglas' Gold Coast fables, Tony Rome and Lady in Cement. It's strictly for people who don't care much about movies—or who persist in regarding movies as sociology.\\" Box office The film was one of the many black films that appeared in the 1970s and became an overnight hit. Davis parlayed both humor and drama together and got a film that worked. He also attracted a black audience, which helped make the film a cult classic. It inspired more black films during the '70s, including more action-packed numbers like Shaft and Super Fly. It is perhaps the most commercially successful film Hollywood produced in the 1970s starring a predominantly black cast.

Cotton Comes to Harlem was released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber (under license from MGM) on September 9, 2014.  Sequel  Ossie Davis declined to direct a sequel to Cotton Comes to Harlem, due to strong artistic differences with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) so the sequel Come Back, Charleston Blue, loosely based on The Heat's On, with much original material injected, ended up being directed by Mark Warren.

The most important member is polydimethylsiloxane. These polymers are of commercial interest because of their relatively high thermal stability and their lubricating properties. Structure Like all siloxanes (e.g., hexamethyldisiloxane), the polymer backbone consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms (...Si−O−Si−O−Si...). Many groups can be attached to the tetravalent silicon centres, but the dominant substituent is methyl or sometimes phenyl. Many silicone liquids are linear polymers end-capped with trimethylsilyl groups. Other silicone liquids are cyclosiloxanes. Applications Silicone oils are primarily used as lubricants, thermic fluid oils or hydraulic fluids. They are excellent electrical insulators and, unlike their carbon analogues, are non-flammable. Their temperature stability and good heat-transfer characteristics make them widely used in laboratories for heating baths (\\"oil baths\\") placed on top of hotplate stirrers, as well as in freeze-dryers as refrigerants. Silicone oil is also commonly used as the working fluid in dashpots, wet-type transformers, diffusion pumps and in oil- filled heaters. Aerospace use includes the external coolant loop and radiators of the International Space Station Zvezda module, which rejects heat in the vacuum of space. The class of silicone oils known as cyclosiloxanes has many of the same properties as other non-cyclic siloxane liquids but also has a relatively high volatility, making it useful in a number of cosmetic products such as antiperspirant. Some silicone oils, such as simethicone, are potent anti-foaming agents due to their low surface tension. They are used in industrial applications such as distillation or fermentation, where excessive amounts of foam can be problematic. They are sometimes added to cooking oils to prevent excessive foaming during deep frying. Silicone oils used as lubricants can be inadvertent defoamers (contaminants) in processes where foam is desired, such as in the manufacture of polyurethane foam. Silicone oil is also one of the two main ingredients in Silly Putty, along with boric acid. Medical uses Consumer products to control flatulence often contain silicone oil. Silicone oils have been used as a vitreous fluid substitute to treat difficult cases of retinal detachment, such as those complicated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, large retinal tears, and penetrating ocular trauma. Additionally, silicone oil is used in general medicine and surgery. Because of silicone oil's water repellent and lubricating properties, it is considered an appropriate material to maintain surgical instruments. Automotive use Silicone oil has been commonly used as the fluid in the automobile cooling fan clutch assemblies, and is still being used in the newer electronic fan clutches.

He is best known for his Hispanic romanticism style of work and was seen a precursor of Modernism. He is buried in the National Pantheon of Venezuela. Life Juan Antonio Pérez Bonalde was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1846. His poem Vuelta a la Patria (Return to the Homeland) is about his return to Venezuela. He translated works of English, German, Italian, Danish, Chinese, Portuguese, French writers into Spanish. The \\"Songbook\\" by Heine and the poem \\"The Raven\\" by Edgar Allan Poe are his most famous translations. After he lost a daughter, he wrote a poem Flor (Flower) in memory of her. He lived many years in exile, due to political problems his family had with the government of that time. His family emigrated to Puerto Rico in 1861 fleeing from the Federal War. After the conclusion of the conflict he returned to Venezuela in 1864 but his stay was short lived when Antonio Guzmán Blanco came to power in 1870. He settled in New York, from where he traveled through the United States, Europe and South America but later returned to Venezuela in 1876 at the advent of a new president, Francisco Linares Alcántara. However, in just one year he returned to New York again, when Guzmán Blanco returned to power. Pérez Bonalde came back to his home country in 1889 at the request of President Raimundo Andueza Palacio but he could not assume his new post as diplomat due to health problems. Pérez Bonalde died in La Guaira, Venezuela, in 1892. A metro station in Caracas is named after him.

A 2015 analysis by staff at Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council estimated that the Universal Allocation per Child programme had increased school attendance for children between the ages of 15 to 17 by 3.9 percent. CCTs have affected not only the overall level of consumption, but also the composition of consumption. There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, in the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels.Rutter, Jill. “Making the case for rigorous, evidence-based policymaking” The Guardian. February 16, 2012. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Turkey, where school enrollment rates among girls were lower than among boys, CCTs have helped reduce this gender gap.Fiszbein, Ariel; Schady, Norbert; Ferreira, Francisco H.G.; Grosh, Margaret; Kelleher,Nial; Olinto, Pedro; Skoufias, Emmanuel. \\"CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS REDUCING PRESENT AND FUTURE POVERTY.\\" World Bank. http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCCT/Resources/5757608-1234228266004/PRR- CCT_web_noembargo.pdf CCTs have resulted in sizeable reductions in poverty among recipients—especially when the transfer has been sufficient, well targeted, and structured in a way that does not discourage recipients from taking other actions to escape poverty. Because CCTs provide a steady income, they have helped protect poor households from the worst effects of unemployment, catastrophic illness, and other sudden income shocks. And making cash transfers to women, as virtually all CCTs do, may have increased their bargaining power. In the US, a paper by the Institute for Research on Poverty concluded in 2011: > \\"Over time, we find that expenditures have shifted toward the disabled and > the elderly, and away from those with the lowest incomes and toward those > with higher incomes, with the consequence that post-transfer rates of deep > poverty for some groups have increased.

By 2011 CCTs had spread to 18 countries in the region and covered as many as 129 million beneficiaries.Stampini, M. and L. Tornarolli. 2012. “The growth of conditional cash transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean: did they go too far?” IDB Policy Brief n. 185, and IZA policy paper n. 49. Although the conditions and amounts of money may vary from country to country, ranging from $5 to $33 per child,Societies on the Move (September 11, 2010). The Economist. 396(8699), pp. 11-15 in general these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children’s human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments.De la Brière, Bénédicte and Rawlings, Laura B. (2006). Examining Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: A Role for Increased Social Inclusion? Social Safety Net Primer Papers. The World Bank Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region, and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP.Societies on the Move (2010, September 11). The Economist. 396(8699), pp. 11-15 Conditional cash transfer programs can be very effective in reducing poverty in the short term since they have helped to increase household income and consumption in poor families. They have also worked effectively in increasing school enrollment and attendance, especially in middle school. A substantial improvement in health and nutrition of the children that benefit from these programs has been acknowledged.Actuar Sobre el Futuro: Romper la Transmisión Intergeneracional de la Igualdad (2010). Regional Human Development Report for Latin America and the Caribbean. UNDP However, studies by the UNDP have shown that conditional cash transfers neither represented a significant increase in the quality of education and in learning nor significant increased salaries, once the recipients entered the labor force. Most CCT programs are very well-targeted and effective in reaching the poor and the excluded groups, notably the extreme poor living outside the reach of social protection programs tied with formal sector employment. On average, 80% of the benefits go to the 40% poorest families. The programs have also promoted equality of gender since they provide larger funds to girls since they often drop out earlier, so it has increased their enrollment and attendance to secondary levels of education. In the long run, these investments may also yield to significant changes in women's empowerment and insertion in economic networks. Africa While most conditional cash transfer programs are in Latin America, a significant amount of research has been conducted regarding the implementation of these programs in Africa. In addition, programs are looking to the Latin America for examples on how to implement these programs. While there are a few unconditional cash transfer programs in Africa being tested, two conditional cash transfer programs in Africa are currently being implemented. For CCTs to be successful, they require sufficient infrastructure. Poor education and health systems limit the benefits of CCT programs. Impacts should be seen in regard to the effectiveness of health and education institutions of the country.  South Africa  In South Africa unconditional cash transfer and social assistance spending amounts to approximately US$20-billion per annum or 15.2% of its total Governmental expenditure (while the country has a GDP of only USD368-billion).\\"SA Government 2019 National Budget Review\\".

The program targets poor regions of Morocco with high dropout rates and should cover 160,000 households by 2010.\\"Morocco: Conditional Cash Transfers and Education.\\" Middle East and North Africa - Morocco: Conditional Cash Transfers and Education. World Bank, 2007. Web. . The pilot program is a comparative test that has four treatment groups. One group is receiving unconditional cash transfers, regardless of child school attendance. The next three are given conditional cash transfers to families of children grades 3-6 based on the child's attendance at school. The three treatment groups vary in how attendance is monitored, ranging from monitoring attendance based on teacher’s report, all the way to a sophisticated system involving monitoring through biometric fingerprint machines. In addition, within each classroom, which parent (the mother or father) is randomized to see if the family benefits more from having the money targeted to one or the other. This study will bring research that assesses the importance of conditionality, monitoring, and targeting within a conditional cash transfer program. Europe Conditional cash transfer programs are not used widely in Europe. In the UK, in 2011 CentreForum proposed an additional child benefit dependent on parenting activities. Turkey In Turkey, CCT program has still been implemented by GDSA since 2003 with education and health components in which almost 6 billion Turkish Liras (app. 2 billion Euros) have been spent to about 3.5 million beneficiary households. In order to be paid regularly in CCT program, students (ages 5–20) have to attend to their school regularly and children (ages 0–6) have to be taken to health centres regularly. All the conditions are being monitored by GDSA from the databases of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education by the means of an interactive web-based MIS. The conditional education grants are provided to children of the target group on school enrollment condition, from the first grade through the end of the twelfth grade. Once qualified as beneficiaries, children should maintain at least 80 per cent attendance rate to continue to receive the grant. Individual payment amounts differ according to components. Girls are paid higher amounts than boys in education component to encourage poor families to send their daughters to school. Besides, due to increasing drop-out rates in higher grades, secondary school (9th-12th grades) students are paid higher amounts than primary school ones in order to ensure the effect of the program on decreasing the drop-out rates. The project named \\"Strengthening the Impact of the Conditional Cash Transfer Programme in Turkey for Increasing High School Attendance\\" (Liseye Devam Senden, Destek Bizden) has been started up in December 2014 by GDSA through EU co-finance. The project has been integrated to Turkey's CCT implementation and designed for high school CCT beneficiaries in order to ensure them to get a degree and decrease early school leaving rates which also is one of the most important topics for 2020 European Union targets for a sustainable growth. In the scope of the project, extra incentives were added into CCT education programme aiming to support high school education attendance which would provide stronger reinforcement for the CCT families. Grants (€60 in 2014 and €70 in 2015 for each eligible student) is provided for parents (preferably mothers) of high school (9th, 10th and 11th grades and 12th for 2015) CCT beneficiaries suffering from lack of financial resources to cover educational expenditures especially in the beginning of each year. Medical applications Modest financial incentives delivered in routine clinical practice have been found to significantly improve adherence to, and completion of, vaccination programmes. Obstacles and failed programs Although the benefits of conditional cash transfer programs across the world have been widely noted, there remains a series of obstacles to their success that have caused some programs to be stunted or terminated completely.Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America. World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 1-25. External factors According to a comprehensive study done by senior research analysts Laura Rawlings and Gloria Rubio of the World Bank, the beginning stages of program implementation present the challenge of creating a reliable implementation schedule.Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. \\"Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America.\\" World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 23 On many occasions, changes in political leadership, natural disasters, or changes in program administration have delayed the implementation schedule and lead to decreased efficiency or program termination. An example of the negative outcomes of one such delay is provided by the UN Development Programme's in-depth study of the short-lived Nicaragua's Social Protection Network. According to the study, the movement of the program administration to the country's Ministry of the Family caused a delay in efficiency and resources that, among other factors, led to the program's termination.Moore, Charity. \\"Nicaragua’s Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program.\\" International Policy Center for Inclusive Growth, no.17, (2009): 1-42. Delays can also be caused by difficulties in developing the program management information system (MIS).Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. \\"Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America.\\" World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 20. One such delay in Mexico's Oportunidades program caused 27% of its targeted population not to receive any transfers after two years of implementation. In addition to unscheduled delays, other external factors that can hinder a CCT's success pertain to unexpected financial crisis.Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. \\"Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty.\\" The World Bank. (2009): 125. According to a comprehensive assessment provided by the World Bank, the structure of conditional cash transfer programs has not yet been adjusted to retain success in the event of a large financial crisis. Primarily, conditional cash transfer programs are not flexible enough to extend benefits to households that fall into the program's targeted population only during economic downturns. Thus, those not normally covered by the program's benefits may be harder hit than those who are but will not be able to be assisted. Exclusion Another common obstacle to success in most CCTs is exclusion of needy homes in the targeting process. In an assessment by the World Bank, much exclusion was due to remote communities' inability to access schools or clinics. Many such communities fall into developing countries' most poverty- stricken populations but cannot follow through with conditionalities since the transportation costs to attend schools or hospital visits outweigh the benefits.Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. \\"Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty.\\" The World Bank. (2009): 1- 245 Furthermore, an evaluation of Mexico's Progresa-Oportunidades program addresses the issue that those in poverty with debilitating illnesses can be excluded from CCTs due to their physical inability to accomplish the conditionalities.Latapi, Augustín and Mercedes González de la Rocha. \\"Girls, Mothers,and Poverty Reduction in Mexico: Evaluating Progresa-Oportunidades\\" in Shahra Razavi (ed.), \\"The Gendered Impacts of Liberalization: Towards 'Embedded Liberalism?' London and New York: Routledge: 267- 289. Exclusion has been noted by both the World Bank study and the Progresa-Oportunidades evaluation evident in community-based targeting and self-targeting approaches. In the case of self-targeting, used by Mexico's Progresa-Oportunidades, working women may be excluded from the program because they are unable to miss work to register or accomplish all conditions.Latapi, Augustín and Mercedes González de la Rocha. \\"Girls, Mothers,and Poverty Reduction in Mexico: Evaluating Progresa- Oportunidades\\" in Shahra Razavi (ed.), \\"The Gendered Impacts of Liberalization: Towards 'Embedded Liberalism?'\\" London and New York: Routledge: 267- 289. In the case of community-based targeting, the World Bank study notes that the extremely poor who may live in generally middle- class communities will be excluded.Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. \\"Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty.\\" The World Bank. (2009): 1- 245. Distrust Targeted populations' distrust of the program due to lack of adequate information has been noted by at least three case studies to be a leading factor in the CCT programs’ downfalls. The extensive study by the UN Development Programme on Nicaragua's Social Protection Network (RPS) reveals that the level of distrust of the program was so high that a domestic publicity campaign could have possibly saved the RPS from extinction.Moore, Charity. \\"Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program.\\" International Policy Center for Inclusive Growth, no.17, (2009): 1-42. This high level of domestic distrust was due, in part, to efforts to politicize the program.Moore, Charity. \\"Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program.\\" International Policy Center for Inclusive Growth, no.17, (2009): 40. One report addressed in the UN Development Programme's study stated that RPS employees were approached by members of the government, who demanded that half their salaries be donated to the party in power. Although the RPS was successful in avoiding the threats, it was later revealed that the RPS was the only Nicaraguan institution of its kind not making government contributions. This same level of distrust is reflected in a study on the feasibility of a Haitian CCT made by the International Food Policy Research Institute. In the focus group they interviewed, almost all subjects expressed a \\"profound lack of faith\\" in the Haitian government. Instead, they preferred that the conditional cash transfer programs be implemented by community committees or NGOs.Cohen, Mark and Dora Weissman. \\"Implementing a Conditional Cash Transfer Program In Haiti: Opportunities and Challenges.\\" The International Food Policy Research Center. 2007 However, this distrust in governments' ability to fairly implement CCTs fairly is not strictly limited to developing countries. In an article in The New York Times addressing the termination of the pilot CCT, Opportunity NYC, the committee leader of one of its lending institutions stated that people were distrustful and confused by the program's intricacies. New York City's deputy mayor for health and human services added that many busy and stressed households were not being able to handle the many conditions they had to complete since they were not efficiently educated about the program.Bosman, Julie. \\"City will stop paying poor for good behavior.\\" The New York Times. March 30, 2010 Unconditional versus conditional cash transfers There is currently much discussion about whether conditionality, or conditions for the cash transfer, is necessary or important to a cash transfer program. Research, such as the pilot conditional cash transfer program in Indonesia called Generasi, examined the importance of conditionality.Olken, Benjamin A., Junko Onishi, Susan Wong. \\"Should Aid Reward Performance? Evidence from a Field Experiment on Health and Education in Indonesia.\\" Working Paper, MIT, August 2011. http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/project-generasi-conditional- community-block-grants-indonesia One report looks at data from Mexico's Oportunidades/Progresa program, which looks at families who accidentally did not receive forms that monitor school attendance and therefore received unconditional cash transfers. It then compares them with those households that did receive the forms. It was shown that conditionality had the strongest impact on children's attendance to secondary school, as enrollment rates in secondary school were higher for those that received the forms. Another report on an experiment in Malawi is researching the importance of conditionality among families with school-age girls. The program was conducted, with data collected between October 2007 and June 2010.Baird, Sarah, Craig McIntosh, and Berk Ozler. Cash or Condition? Evidence from a Cash Transfer Experiment. Working paper no. 5259. Vol. 45. World Bank, 2010. Print. Impact Evaluation Ser. It was found that the treatment arm providing conditional cash transfer programs had higher enrollment rates, as well as higher scores in independently administered tests of cognitive ability, mathematics and English reading comprehension. However, the UCT treatment arm had a much lower incidence of pregnancy and marriage among schoolage girls. A strong argument against the conditionality of social cash transfers is proposed by proponents of a rights-based approach to development. From a human rights perspective, cash transfers are a means to ensure the human rights to social protection and an adequate standard of living for all members of society, including first and foremost the fundamental right to food. States have the duty to ensure those rights with a maximum of available resources. While reducing poverty in general, conditional cash transfers have shown to often exclude those who need it the most, violating the human rights principle of non-discrimination and equality.Künnemann, Ralf and Ralf Leonhard. A Human Rights View of Social Cash Transfers for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Brot für die Welt, Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst, 2008. The following program in Malawi is an example of an unconditional cash transfer: The Mchinji Pilot Social Cash Transfer Scheme is part of the larger Malawi Social Protection Policy and Framework, and began in April 2006. It is mainly financed by UNICEF and the National AIDS Commission.Schubert, Bernd, and Mayke Huijbregts. The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Pilot Scheme, Preliminary Lessons Learned. Tech. New York: UNICEF, 2006. Print. Social Protection Initiatives for Children, Women and Families: An Analysis of Recent Experiences. The objectives of the scheme are to reduce poverty of people in the pilot area who are ultra poor and labor constrained, increase school enrolment and attendance, and to generate information regarding the feasibility of a cash transfer program as part of a Social Protection Programme for Malawi. The goal for this program is to reduce the ultra poverty rate from the 22% rate in 2007 to 10% by 2015. This program targets those households that are ultra poor (See poverty for definition) and those who are labor constrained, defined as either a household in which no able-bodied members 19-64 can work due to chronic sickness or disability or a household with one-able bodied member that has to care for more than three dependents. About 22% of Malawi as of 2007 was ultra-poor, living on less than 20 cents a day, and of that group 10% are labor constrained. The program would give anywhere from 600 kwacha ($4 US) monthly for a one-person household to 1800 kwacha ($13 US) monthly for a four or more person family. There is also an extra bonus of 200 kwacha for children enrolled in primary school and 400 kwacha for children enrolled in secondary school. The location for the program is in the Mchinji District, the 14th poorest district out of 28 in Malawi. It was chosen for its average poverty level of all the districts in Malawi and its proximity to the capital, Lilongwe. The first comprehensive systematic review of evidence on health effects of cash transfers found that the relative effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfers remains very uncertain. The review found only three studies that compared conditional cash transfers with unconditional ones directly, and it recommended additional randomized controlled trials of conditional compared with unconditional cash transfers.

The movie parodies big budget American films (Basic Instinct, Pretty Woman and The Terminator, among others, are directly spoofed) and relies heavily on puns and word play, which makes it somewhat inaccessible for non-French speakers. Synopsis Odile Deray (Lauby) is the publicist for the slasher movie Red is Dead, which features a serial killer whose weapons of choice are the hammer and sickle. She is invited to the Cannes film festival, where she is faced with the unanimous opinion that the movie is extremely bad. However, Red is Dead soon attracts the public attention when its projectionist is murdered by what seems to be a copycat of the movie's killer. Ecstatic, Odile brings the movie's intellectually disabled star Simon Jérémi (Farrugia) to the festival and hires bodyguard and self-proclaimed womanizer Serge Karamazov (Chabat) to protect them. One by one, all the projectionists assigned to the movie are murdered, keeping Red is Dead in the spotlight. Meanwhile, detective Patrick Bialès (Darmon) investigates on the murders and starts a romantic relationship with Odile. Detailed plot First day of the festival The film opens with the last minutes of Red is Dead. In their bloody house, Sandy (de Fougerolles) and Ben (Farrugia) congratulate themselves on their defeat of Youri, the communist killer who murdered their entire family, and who is now lying on the floor, apparently dead. Sandy goes to have a bath while Ben cleans the house in preparation for a dinner they have tonight. When Sandy comes out of the bathroom, she is attacked by a very alive Youri. Ben tries to protect her and accidentally kills her. He rushes out of the house and struggles to find the keys to open his convertible car. When he finally succeeds, the killer is only a few feet away from him. Ben, however, remembers with horror that he has forgotten to turn the vacuum cleaner off, and runs back to the house, knocking Youri into a conveniently placed petroleum puddle with the car door. After turning the vacuum cleaner off, he runs back to the car, where a phone call warns him that Youri is standing behind him. Ben fights Youri with his car phone, and manages to send him back into the puddle before setting it on fire. After Ben drives into the sunset, Youri triumphantly emerges from the puddle and the end credits roll. In the theater, Odile Deray asks the viewers what they thought. Everybody leaves without a word, and she chases after a critic and pleads with him to write a favorable article. He refuses on the grounds that the movie is \\"utter crap\\". We learn that Odile is the publicist for the movie, and that today is the first day of the Cannes film festival. Odile visits the projectionist (Karyo) and briefly talks with him while he argues on the phone with his wife. After Odile leaves, the projectionist is murdered by a hammer and sickle wielding killer. Second day of the festival Odile is talking with the projectionist's widow (Lemercier). While the widow mourns her husband and reminisces their last argument, Odile realizes she can use the murder for publicity, and decides to bring the film's star to the festival, and to hire a bodyguard. In a hotel room, a man watches the news on television. A deputy was murdered, and the main suspect is a politician called Jean-Paul Martoni. When the projectionist's murder is brought up, the man turns the TV off. In Paris, Serge Karamazov unsuccessfully tries to talk his boss's secretary into letting him sleep with her. She ignores him and tells him to go in to talk to his boss. While playing various sports, Karamazov's boss reminds him that his job description does not include having sex with his clients, and instructs him to go to Cannes to protect Simon Jérémi, Red is Dead's main star. At the Nice airport, Karamazov meets Odile, and the two see Simon arrive, wielding a balloon and a nametag, and accompanied by a stewardess. Once in the car, Odile tells Simon of all the exciting things he is going to do in Cannes, prompting Simon to throw up. He explains that he throws up whenever he is really happy. While Karamazov and Simon get to the Martinez hotel and are taken to their room, a second projectionist (Gélin) is murdered in the same fashion as the first one. In the projection room, Odile discovers the body and calls the police. Commissaire Bialès soon arrives and is introduced by a short documentary movie about his life thus far. Simon and Karamazov arrive at the scene. Karamazov tells a police officer of his frustration at having to babysit Simon, and Simon, excited to see a Kinoton movie projector, throws up. Bialès wonders about the meaning of the letters found carved on the wall after both murders, an O and a D, and concludes that they spell \\"do\\", leading him to believe that the killer is a musician. At the police headquarters, Odile is being interrogated in a scene parodying Basic Instinct (instead of smoking, Odile is eating sauerkraut). As Commissaire Bialès tells Odile of his suspicion that she planned the murders as a publicity stunt, another policeman comes in with a new piece of information: he found a piece of fabric on the scene of the crime. Back in the unnamed man's hotel room, the man is once again watching the news, and as he passes in front of a mirror, his face is revealed. Third day of the festival At the Martinez, Odile instructs Karamazov and Simon to hurry and get ready for the press conference, which starts in an hour. Upon realizing that Simon doesn't have anything to wear, Odile and Karamazov take him shopping in an obvious Pretty Woman parody. Later, at the press conference, Odile scolds two women who are loudly gossiping, and the projection starts. Meanwhile, Karamazov is in the projection room to protect the projectionist (Bacri) against the killer. Karamazov, however, has food poisoning, and is passing foul gas, which prompts the projectionist to send him away to the bathroom. On his way, Karamazov meets an old flame, and they make awkward small talk. In the projection room, the projectionist is murdered. Karamazov sees the killer run away, and chases after him. However, he is stopped by a group of mimes protesting against sound films, and the killer gets away. Fourth day of the festival Odile is making preparations for the next projection, while Karamazov demonstrates his new hi-tech metal detector and Simon tries on outfits. Everybody gathers around the TV when a report about Red is Dead is shown on the news. It features an interview of Odile and Simon at a party held in the honour of the murdered projectionists, during which Simon, once again, throws up. Later, at the Martinez, Odile meets Bialès for dinner. Odile talks about her life before Red is Dead, and as sexual tension quickly builds up between the two, they leave for Bialès's apartment. At a night club, Simon finds Karamazov completely drunk and ranting about his inability to seduce Odile. Meanwhile, at Bialès's apartment, the two have just had sex, and Odile accidentally discovers the killer's costume in a wardrobe. Horrified, she rushes to the night club, where she finds Karamazov enthusiastically insulting her. The next scene starts with a disclaimer stating that, because of budgetary limits, it will be entirely dubbed by the crew, including sound effects. Amidst arguments and chit chat by the dubbers, the fourth projectionist (Mitchell) is killed, and the killer accidentally cuts his own finger. Another disclaimer then informs the viewer that the dubbed scene is over. Fifth and last day of the festival At the hotel's restaurant, Odile is briefing Simon about his scheduled interviews. Karamazov arrives, and Odile tells him she has found the next projectionist, who will be joining them. They argue about Karamazov's behaviour in the night club, and Odile reveals that she thinks Bialès is the murderer. Karamazov muses about the letters left by the killer: they are now O, D, I and L. Karamazov wonders if it spells Lido, and theorizes that the killer may be a cabaret dancer. He then proceeds to explain that the murderer is probably a serial killer, and that he has designed a giant mousetrap to catch him. His explanations are interrupted by the arrival of the new projectionist, the unnamed man who was seen watching the news all throughout the movie: it's Émile Gravier (Karmann), an old friend of Odile's. The camera dramatically zooms on Émile's finger, which is wrapped in a bandage. Odile and Émile reminisce about their youth, the latter much more enthusiastically than the former. Later, the awards ceremony is about to start, and Odile, Karamazov, Simon and Émile are in a Limousine, getting ready to climb the famous stairs to the Palais des festivals. Odile offers Émile chewing gum, which prompts him to remember, in a flashback, the way Odile always neglected him for her boyfriends, while he was secretly in love with her. The four get out of the car and make their way up the stairs. Suddenly, Jean-Paul Martoni, who has been convicted of the deputy's murder, arrives and, threatening the crowd with a gun, runs into the building. Émile, under enormous stress, passes out. Once inside, Odile panics about Émile's inconsciousness, which leaves her with no projectionist. Simon reveals that he can project Red is Dead, having been trained as a projectionist, and adds \\"because, you see, I'm not really an actor!\\". While Simon prepares to start projecting the movie, the crowd is getting impatient. Odile instructs Karamazov to distract them, and he and Bialès launch in an \\"improvised\\" musical number about the Carioca, which the public loves. The movie starts playing, and they get off the stage. Bialès is reminded of Martoni's presence inside the building, and goes after him. In the projection room, Simon is attacked by Émile, who reveals that he killed all the previous projectionists in an attempt to get Odile's attention. After Simon offers Émile some chewing gum, the two struggle and knock the projector around. In the theater, Odile is horrified to notice that the wrong reel has been launched, and instructs Karamazov to go check on Simon. Karamazov finds Émile and Simon in a struggle, and exclaims \\"Simon, so it was you all along! I knew it!\\", letting Émile escape. A frustrated Simon explains that Émile is the killer. Simon and Karamazov chase after Émile, only to discover him caught in Karamazov's giant mouse trap. Odile and Bialès arrive and learn the killer's identity. Odile inquires about the costume she found in Bialès's apartment, but his explanation is covered by loud music. The two reconcile, but suddenly, Martoni storms in and takes Odile hostage. After shooting Bialès in the knee, Martoni is knocked out by Émile, who managed to get out of the trap. Émile starts to explain himself, but is shot by Martoni. As he lays dying, Odile offers him chewing gum. Martoni is arrested and Bialès is carried away on a gurney; he reassures Odile that he will be able to walk again, but she tells him she is only worried about her movie. Outside, Karamazov once again wonders about the letters, O, D, I, L. Odile, Simon and Karamazov walk away. When Simon says that he is hungry and would be happy to eat Chinese, Karamazov and Odile agree to go to an Italian restaurant.

These relations were tense during the Angolan Civil War when the U.S. government backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels, but have warmed since the Angolan government renounced Communism in 1992. History  1970s to 2002 – U.S. support for FNLA and UNITA  Starting in the 1970s, the U.S. supported the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and then UNITA, insurgents opposing the ruling political party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.

This was thwarted by the Tunney/Clark amendment, passed by a Democratic congress forbidding any involvement.895 Days that changed the world accessed March 4, 2008 The United States opposed Angola's membership in the United Nations from its declaration of independence in 1975 to its acceptance in December 1976. Angola did not have formal relations with the United States until 1993. Fidel Castro regarded the attitude of the United States: > Why were they vexed?

Some imperialists wonder why we help the Angolans, > which interests we have.

By helping the people of Angola we are fulfilling a > fundamental duty of Internationalism.\\"Une Odyssee Africaine\\" (France, 2006, > 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri In a meeting by the National Security Council (NSC) on 27 June 1975 including President Gerald Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, and CIA Director William Egan Colby among others, the U.S. took a closer look at the development in Angola, especially after they became aware of Soviet aid for the MPLA. They found that the Portuguese left the country without any preparation for independence. It was clear that whoever owned the capital owned the country, similar to the situation during the civil war in the Congo, where the U.S. helped their allies succeed in holding the capital Leopoldville, thus eventually securing or regaining control of all of Zaire. The U.S. considered neutrality or a diplomatic campaign, both of which Kissinger dismissed. In the further course of the conversation President Ford declared, in spite of planned elections, it is important to get \\"his man\\" in first, referring to Savimbi. Secretary Schlesinger thought that the US \\"might wish to encourage the disintegration of Angola. Cabinda in the clutches of Mobutu would mean far greater security of the petroleum resources\\". In any case success must be certain before anything is done otherwise the US should remain neutral. For the president it was unacceptable to do nothing. He ordered the preparation of options.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB67/gleijeses6.pdf (Document obtained from Gerald Ford Library, NSC Meetings File, Box 2) The United States had known of South Africa's covert invasion plans in advance and co-operated militarily with its forces, contrary to Kissinger's testimony to Congress at the time, as well as the version in his memoirs and what President Ford told the Chinese, who were worried about South African engagement in Angola.Gleijeses, Piero: Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976 (The University of North Carolina Press) A report by Henry Kissinger of 13.

In 1977, Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA's representative to the United States, convinced the U.S. to shift their support from the FNLA to UNITA following the MPLA's decisive defeat of the FNLA at the Battle of Quifangondo. 1976-1980 Carter years Despite human rights concerns, Carter continued U.S. support for Joseph Mobutu of Zaire, who defeated Angolan-backed insurgents in conflicts known as Shaba I and Shaba II. Until 1975, Washington ignored southern Africa because the Cold War was in play there. Weak insurgencies existed in Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, and Namibia, but did not appear to threaten white rule after the colonial powers left. The collapse of the last colonial power, Portuguese, in April 1974 meant the end of white rule in Angola and Mozambique. Cuba, with Soviet help, sent a large military force. It took control of Angola in 1976. The region now became a Cold War battleground. The Carter administration negotiated endlessly with South Africa and the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), which was the guerrilla movement fighting for the independence of Namibia from South Africa. Vance and Brzezinski battled over policy but the U.S. never sent troops. Instead Cuba and the Soviet Union strongly supported the Namibian insurgents and 20,000 Cuban soldiers were poised in neighboring Angola. The Carter team failed to find a solution.George C.

The MPLA held blatantly rigged elections in 1992, which were rejected by eight opposition parties. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. UNITA sent peace negotiators to the capital, where the MPLA murdered them, along with 20,000 UNITA members. Savimbi was still ready to continue the elections. The MPLA then massacred tens of thousands of UNITA and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) voters nationwide.National Society for Human Rights, Ending the Angolan Conflict, Windhoek, Namibia, July 3, 2000.John Matthew, Letters, The Times, UK, November 6, 1992 (election observer). 2002 – U.S. recognizes MPLA  After the government renounced Communism, the U.S. recognized the Angolan government. In 1995 António Franca became the first Angolan ambassador to the United States. United States Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Angola and Gabon in September 2002 and among other subjects, discussed petroleum. U.S. assistance to Angola amounted to US$188 million in 2003, much of it in the field of health services and disease control. USAID's food for peace program gave over US$30 million to Angola's population in 2005. Angola is currently the second biggest trading partner in Sub-Saharan Africa of the U.S., primarily because of oil; Angola produces of oil per day, second only to Nigeria in all of Africa. This is expected to rise to per day by 2008. A 2005 visit by Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos to Washington, D.C. was a sign of warm relations between the two nations. In May 2007 the Council on Foreign Relations said, \\"Few African countries are more important to U.S. interests than Angola.\\" Current initiatives USAID's development program in Angola in FY 2007 was consistent with the country's status as a developing country at a pivotal juncture in its development and reconstruction. In FY 2006, the program budget was $25.5 million and focused on civil society strengthening, improved governance, and democratization; market-oriented economic analysis and economic reform policy; agricultural sector productivity; maternal and child health; HIV/AIDS prevention, education and voluntary counseling; and workforce development. Angola also launched a major program to fight malaria through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). The Governing Justly and Democratically objective strengthens constituencies and institutions required for democratic governance by strengthening civil society organizations and promoting local government decentralization; fostering an independent media, government transparency, accountability, and capability, and improved dialogue between citizens and government; and laying the groundwork for free and fair elections. The Investing in People objective aims to improve maternal and child health and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases by helping communities and institutions to provide necessary health services and to conduct HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The PMI is the largest health program and expands efforts to scale up proven preventive and treatment interventions toward achievement of 85% coverage among vulnerable groups and 50% reduction in morbidity due to malaria. The Economic Growth objective fosters economic policy and financial sector reform; credit access for micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises; and expanded trade and investment. To assist with economic reform, in FY 2007 the State Department provided $2.2 million to work on land tenure, economic policy, and the financial sector. An additional $143,000 in grants was provided to community development projects and non- governmental organization (NGO)-sponsored democracy and human rights projects. $152,000 in International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds was provided for English language training to the Angolan Armed Forces. Professional training for law enforcement personnel at the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Gaborone, Botswana continued. The Safe Skies for Africa program provided around $800,000 in equipment and training to the Angolan civil aviation authority. As part of its public diplomacy program, the Embassy provided nearly $434,000 in English language training, educational exchanges and fellowships, and information resource services. The State Department provided $6 million for ongoing landmine, small arms, and munitions destruction projects throughout the country. These projects have played a major role in clearing agricultural land and opening critical road networks and increasing access in those areas of the country most impacted by landmines. At the same time, the energy-based U.S. trading relationship continues to expand and spark other ties. One offshoot has been the development of a Sister City relationship between Lafayette, Louisiana and Cabinda and between Houston, Texas and Luanda. The Catholic University of Luanda has close links with a number of American institutions and has received support from the Angola Educational Assistance Fund, a U.S. non-profit organization organized by Citizens Energy of Boston. Sonangol has a longstanding program of educating its professionals in U.S. universities, complementing Chevron's policy of U.S. training for its own growing pool of Angolan professionals. Economic Relations In 2015, American exports to Angola amounted to US$1.23 billion and Angolan exports to the United States amounted to US$1.21 billion.https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/AGO/Year/LTST/Summary Principal U.S. officials Embassy of Angola in Washington, D.C. * US Ambassador— Nina Maria Fite * Deputy Chief of Mission—Francisco Fernandez * USAID Director—Jason Fraser * Defense Attaché—LTC Chris Grieg Embassies The Embassy of the United States is located in Miramar, Luanda, Angola.

Other characters include stalked buds with just one pair of scales, and flowers on arching to pendulous racemes. The samaras are small, and often numerous. They are small deciduous trees, typically 5–15 m tall, rarely to 20 m tall, fast-growing when young but soon slowing down with age, and often short-lived; they typically occur as understorey trees in mountain forests, often along streamsides. ;Species: * Acer capillipes - Kyushu maple, red snakebark maple * Acer caudatifolium * Acer crataegifolium - hawthorn-leaf maple * Acer davidii (syn.

It has a strong similarity to the better known Ionic order, but differs in the capital, where a palmette rises between the two outer volutes, rather than them being linked horizontally by a form at the top of the capital. Many examples also show simplified details compared to the Ionic. Background and history \\"Proto-Aeolic\\" capitals of Southern Levant Capitals of a style widely known, improperly, as \\"Proto-Aeolic\\" or \\"Proto-Ionian\\", are found in city gates and royal buildings in the kingdoms of Israel (mainly from the 9th century BCE), Judah, Moab, and Ammon (late 8th or early 7th century BCE). The more appropriate and neutral name \\"Iron Age volute capitals from the Levant\\" has been offered. The connection to the Aeolic order, which they precede, is rather complex and probably based on a general use of palm-tree decoration throughout the Ancient Near East.Lipschits, Oded. The Origin and Date of the Volute Capitals from the Levant, in: Finkelstein, Israel and Na'aman, Nadav (eds). The Fire Signals of Lachish. Eisenbrauns (Winona Lake, 2011), pp. 203-225. Accessed 4 September 2020. Aeolic order of Asia Minor The Aeolic form developed in northwestern Asia Minor, out of Syrian and Phoenician capitals. It is also seen in some temples in Sicily, and is named from the Aeolian colonies of northwestern Asia Minor.Philip P. Betancourt. The Aeolic Style in Architecture: A Survey of its Development in Palestine, the Halikarnassos Peninsula, and Greece, 1000-500 B.C (Princeton University Press) 1977. The earliest surviving examples of the Aeolic order are contemporary with the emergence of the Ionic and Doric orders in the 6th century BC. Some authorities have suggested that the Ionic style represents a development of the Aeolic, but others disagree.The Art and Culture of Early Greece, 1100-480 B.C., p. 132, Cornell University Press, 1987 (rev. edn.), In the 1970s, there were found 34 proto-Aeolic capitals in Palestine, of which 13 belonged to Megiddo and 7 to the Samaria. They were built up for some ashlar masonries, an architectonic style reserved to the Israelite royal places during the Iron Age. One of them is 110 x 28 x 60 cm of dimension and also differs frm the canon for its ornamental details, showing a triangular shape in the centre as the point of juncture of the capital volutes. Associated forms Some Etruscan tombs show a similar capital, with two large volutes that do not lie flat, but no palmette in the centre.

Emergency nursing is a specialty within the field of professional nursing focusing on the care of patients who require prompt medical attention to avoid long-term disability or death. In addition to addressing \\"true emergencies,\\" emergency nurses increasingly care for people who are unwilling or unable to get primary medical care elsewhere and come to emergency departments for help. In fact, only a small percentage of emergency department (ED) patients have emergency conditions such as a stroke, heart attack or major trauma. Emergency nurses also tend to patients with acute alcohol and/or drug intoxication, psychiatric and behavioral problems and those who have been raped. Emergency nurses are most frequently employed in hospital emergency departments, although they may also work in urgent care centers, sports arenas, and on medical transport aircraft and ground ambulances.  The history of emergency nursing  Around the 1800s hospitals became more popular and there was a growth in emergency care. The first development of an emergency room was originally called the \\"First Aid Room.\\" Originally, nurses only dressed wounds, applied eye ointments, treated minor burns with salves and bandages, and attended patients with minor illnesses like colds and sore throats. The rule of thumb was first in, first served, but there were many cases where some people were in more need of emergency care than others, and as the situation became more intolerable, one of the greatest medical developments came into perspective: triage. For centuries triage had been used in war but was not yet established in the emergency department. The first time triage was referred to during a non-disaster situation was at Yale New Haven Hospital, Connecticut, United States in 1963, and since then has become developed and more defined.Jones, G. (2010). History of Emergency Nursing. Retrieved from http://www.icn.ch/networks/history-of-emergency-nursing/  Emergency nurse skills, knowledge and qualities  Emergency nurses must be able to sit, stand, walk, reach, squat and lift throughout their eight- or twelve-hour shift. They must have good manual dexterity, hearing and vision. They must understand principles of human development, anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, They must also have a working knowledge of the many legal issues impacting health care such as consent, handling of evidence, mandatory reporting of child and elder abuse, and involuntary psychiatric holds. They must be adept and comfortable working with patients of many different backgrounds, cultures, religions, ages and types of disabilities. They must also be able to deal with situations which are difficult, emotional or disgusting. Emergency nurses must also know how to care for themselves physically and emotionally.  The role of the emergency nurse  The role of the emergency nurse is to evaluate and monitor patients and to manage their care in the emergency department. They may also supervise licensed practical nurses and unlicensed assistive personnel (\\"nurse aides\\" or \\"care partners\\"). It can be a challenge to get everything done quickly and correctly in an ever-changing environment. Some ED nurse functions are common to other nursing specialties, while others are specific to emergency nursing. These can be divided into 1.) assessment, 2.) planning and managing care, 3.) tasks, 4.) communication, and 5.) teaching. # Assessment. Emergency nurses interview a patient to get a health history, a list of current medications being taken and allergies. He or she performs a physical examination. This is often a limited exam based on the patient's chief complaint and only infrequently a complete head-to-toe examination. The ED nurse periodically reassesses the patient to detect any changes, either improvement, decompensation or no change. This may be done after a treatment is given to evaluate its effectiveness or at certain time intervals as appropriate for the patient's condition. # Planning and managing care. The ED nurse must have a plan of what to do for the patient, when and in what order. Managing an ED patient's care includes decisions such as whether the patient can go to X-ray before getting blood drawn, what tasks to delegate to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs), and how many visitors are allowed in the patient's room, among others. # Tasks. There are procedures only the physician can perform, but many others are done by the emergency nurse. These include inserting intravenous (\\"IV\\") lines, urinary catheters and nasogastric (\\"NG\\") tubes; drawing blood samples from veins and arteries; dressing wounds; applying splints, administering medications, and in certain jurisdictions RNs are trained to suture wounds. In some cases, emergency nurses may order certain tests and medications following \\"collaborative practice guidelines\\" or \\"standing orders\\" set out by the hospital's emergency physician staff. # Communication. All the emergency nurse's observations are recorded in the patient's medical record. These are used by other members of the healthcare team caring for the patient. ED nurses must keep the emergency physician apprised of a patient's condition; if it suddenly worsens, the doctor must be notified immediately. If the patient is admitted to a room in the hospital or transferred to another facility, he or she must \\"give report\\" to the nurse at the patient's destination. # Teaching. In addition to keeping the patient and his or her family up-to-date throughout the visit, the emergency nurse also conducts teaching sessions with them. Topics often include how to take prescribed medication, how to prevent complications, when to return to the ED, and a patient's diagnosis. These are often short interactions and the nurse must evaluate what information the patient needs, how in detail to explain a topic, and the patient's readiness to learn. To do this, the nurse must consider the patient's level of education, level of pain, education level, cultural influences, age, deficiencies in vision or hearing, and other factors.  Special emergency nurse roles  One four-tiered system of triage Triage Nurse An emergency nurse is assigned to triage patients as they arrive in the emergency department, and as such, is the first professional patients will see. Therefore, this emergency nurse must be skilled at rapid, accurate physical examination and early recognition of life-threatening conditions. Based on the triage nurse's findings, a triage category is assigned, typically from 1 to 5, with 1 being a true, life-threatening emergency. ED Charge Nurse An experienced emergency nurse is put in the role of charge nurse or team leader. This nurse is responsible for the overall \\"flow\\" of the department. He or she assigns nurses to patients, assures patients are being transported to and from tests outside the ED, addresses patient complaints and concerns, communicates with the house supervisor, takes phone calls, and assures nurses get their breaks.  Emergency Nurse Practitioner (ENP)  In the United Kingdom A specialist nurse will independently assess, diagnose, investigate, and treat a wide range of common accidents and injuries working autonomously without supervision by medical staff. They primarily treat a wide range of musculoskeletal problems, skin problems and minor illnesses. They are trained in advanced nursing skills. Under the National Health Service grading system, ENPs are typically graded Band 6 or 7. Additionally, some specialized nurses perform as emergency care practitioners. They generally work in the pre-hospital setting dealing with a wide range of medical or emergency problems. Their primary function is to assess, diagnose and treat a patient in the home in an emergency setting. In the United States An advanced practice nurse assesses, diagnoses, and treats a variety of common illnesses, injuries and disease processes in emergency care settings. ENPs are trained in advanced nursing and medical skills such as x-ray interpretation, ophthalmic slit lamp examination, suturing, local and regional anesthesia, abscess incision and drainage, advanced airway techniques, fracture reduction, and casting and splinting. In Australia  Australian nurse practitioners follow the clinical practice guidelines developed by the Victorian Emergency Nurse Practitioner Collaborative (VENPC), which has supported nurse practitioner development in Victoria. These guidelines include attending to minor head injuries, burns, open wounds, joint pain, haemophilia, blood and fluid exposure, PV bleeding, urinary tract infections (UTIs), abdominal pain, cellulitis, and more.  Emergency nurses in Africa  Emergency nurses work in various places, many of which are understaffed as there are nursing shortages across Africa. There is also a shortage of doctors, leaving many tasks for nurses with limited guidelines or standards to deal with, and the scope of practice is quite undefined for many emergency nurses. Nurses may be required to work outside their scope, causing frustration and increasing the opportunities for occupational health hazards. It can be speculated that triage protocols are either lacking or not being followed. The limited basic knowledge and skill of emergency nursing included in undergraduate nurse training programs, and the limited number of nurse trainers, provides difficulty for many pending nurses to acquire the skills needed to work in emergency settings.Augustyn, J., Bell, S., Brysiewicz, P., Coetzee, I., Eeden, I., Heyns, T., Lobue, N., Papa, A., Pho, A., Qampi, M., Sepeku, A., Hangula, R., Wolf, L. (2012). Developing a framework for emergency nursing practice in Africa. African Journal of Emergency Medicine, 2(4) 174-181. doi:10.1016/j.afjem.2012.09.001  Challenges of emergency nursing  Emergency nursing is a demanding job and can be unpredictable. Emergency nurses need to have basic knowledge of most specialty areas, to be able to work under pressure, communicate effectively with many types of patients, collaborate with a variety of health care providers and prioritize the tasks that must be performed. It can be quite draining both physically and mentally for many nurses. Australian emergency departments treat over eight million patients each year as of 2018. They spend much of their time on their feet and must be ready for unexpected changes in patients' conditions as well as sudden influxes of patients to the emergency department. Emergency department nurses may be exposed to traumatic situations such as heavy bleeding, dismemberment and even death. Violence is a growing challenge for many nurses in the emergency department. Emergency nurses often receive both physical and verbal abuse from patients and visitors.  Board certification in emergency nursing  Certified Emergency Nurse - CEN The Certified Emergency Nurse (CEN) designation is granted to a registered nurse who has demonstrated expertise in emergency nursing by passing a computer-administered examination given by the Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing (BCEN). The certification exam first became available in July 1980, was accredited by the Accreditation Board for Specialty Nursing Certification (ABSNC) in February 2002, and was re-accredited in 2007, 2012, and 2016. The certification is valid for four years, and can be renewed either by passing another examination, or by attesting that the nurse has completed 100 continuing education units (CEUs) in the specialty. As of 2019, the BCEN has designated over 38,000 active CENs in the United States and Canada. The CEN exam has 175 questions; 150 are used for testing purposes (25 are sample questions). The passing score is 70% and the candidate has three hours to take the exam. The test is administered in Pearson Vue testing centers internationally. Certified Pediatric Emergency Nurse - CPEN The Certified Pediatric Emergency Nurse (CPEN) designation is applied to a registered nurse who has demonstrated expertise in pediatric emergency nursing by passing a computer-administered examination given jointly by the Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing (BCEN) and the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB). The certification exam first became available on January 21, 2009, and was accredited by ABSNC in May 2015. The certification is valid for four years, and can be renewed either by passing another examination, by completing 100 contact hours (continuing education) in the specialty, or by completing 1,000 clinical practice hours and 40 contact hours in the specialty. As of 2020, the BCEN and the PNCB have designated over 5,200 active CPENs. The CPEN exam has 175 questions; 150 are used for testing purposes (25 are sample questions). The passing score is 87% and the candidate has three hours to take the exam. The test is administered in AMP testing centers internationally.

He was chiefly responsible for reestablishing the clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch and developing its modern brand image, and was CEO until 2014. Early life Jeffries was born in 1944, the son of Shirley and Donald R. Jeffries (1918-1985). Born in Oklahoma, he grew up in Los Angeles, California where his father owned Party Time, a chain of party supply stores. After high school, Jeffries attended Claremont Men's College (now Claremont McKenna College) where he graduated in 1966 with a BA in Economics. He received an MBA from Columbia Business School in 1968 and also studied at the London School of Economics. That same year Jeffries joined the management training program at Abraham & Straus, a now-defunct New York City department store. During this time Jeffries worked along with Allen Questrom (of J.C. Penney) and Millard S. Drexler (the previous CEO of Gap Inc., who now works at J. Crew). In 1984, Jeffries founded Alcott & Andrews, a brand targeted at career women. The brand was initially successful, but in 1989 it fell into bankruptcy due to overexpansion, and closed. Afterward, Jeffries took a position at Paul Harris, a Midwest clothing chain. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. The chain store design in the early 1990s Jeffries was hired by Leslie Wexner (CEO of LBrands, then named The Limited) to invigorate Abercrombie & Fitch. The company, founded in 1892, had been purchased by Limited Brands in 1988 after bankruptcy. Jeffries is considered to have been the main creator of the new look for the company. It was rebuilt as an upscale apparel retailer for the collegiate, and by the mid-1990s, Abercrombie & Fitch had opened dozens of new stores. By 1996, LBrands was no longer heavily involved with the company, and eventually left it under the management of Jeffries. During this time, A&F; has attracted controversy from different groups such as the feminist movement and the American Decency Association, and a number of lawsuits. An outspoken businessman, Jeffries has been quoted making statements in the press that can be considered controversial. Such comments include his assertion that \\"We hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that.\\" In 2004, he made approximately $25 million USD with a \\"stay bonus\\" of US$6 million, which dropped from $12 million after a controversy involving his \\"excessive compensation\\". After surveying 2,000 US corporations, the Corporate Library named Jeffries as the \\"Highest Paid Worst Performer\\" of 2008, after he received a compensation package valued at $71.8 million. Jeffries refused to lower prices or offer discounts at Abercrombie & Fitch stores during the retail recession until September 2009, after the company posted same store sales losses for 17 consecutive months. Jeffries' employment agreement was set to expire December 31, 2008. On December 22, 2008, A&F; corporate announced that it had been renewed. It expired on February 22, 2014. After a slump in 2008 due to the financial crisis, sales recovered in 2011. His total compensation in 2011 was estimated at $46,609,075, most of this being in the form of stock options.equilar.com, retrieved 19 October 2012 Jeffries owns about 2.9% of the company's shares making him difficult to remove without his consent. His most recent contract calls for a payout of over one hundred million dollars should he lose his job due to an ownership change. On December 9, 2013, it was reported Jeffries had agreed to a new contract with A&F; that would tie his pay to company performance. Also in December, market commentator Herb Greenberg named Jeffries the worst CEO of 2013. Greenberg pointed out that the share price for Abercrombie and Fitch had collapsed by 40% during the year.Greenberg: And the Worst CEO of 2013 Is...?, by Herb Greenberg, 19 December 2013, The Street This was after Jim Cramer of CNBC had earlier named Jeffries to his \\"Wall of Shame\\". Jeffries was once one of the best-paid CEOs in retail but he saw his compensation shrink 72 percent in 2013. His total pay was $2.24 million in the fiscal year of 2013, which ended February 1. That was down from $8.16 million in the previous year and $48.1 million before that. On December 9, 2014, Jeffries stepped down as A&F; CEO amid mass criticism of the company's performance and 11 straight quarters of negative company comparable- store sales. The shares jumped 8 percent after the move was announced, marking the biggest one-day gain in more than nine months. Personal life On April 3, 1971, in Miami, Florida, Jeffries married Susan Marie Isabel Hansen, daughter of Charles Henry Hansen, president and founder of Charles Hansen Music Publishing. They have one child, Andrew Hansen Jeffries.http://www.socialregisteronline.com/#!vartanian-jeffries- wedding/c1e2p Following a quiet separation from his wife, Jeffries lives with his partner Matthew Smith and three dogs.https://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/exclusive-abercrombie-execs-troubled-by- involvement-of-ceos Smith heads the Jeffries Family Office, an Ohio limited liability corporation that \\"advocates for the personal interests of Abercrombie's CEO.\\" Smith also reviews internal Abercrombie & Fitch documents and consults on real estate matters. Smith, a former hair dresser, often inspected the A&F; offices by walking through and doing desk checks to keep offices, conference rooms, and employee dress to strict standards published in employee memos. His involvement with the running of Abercrombie & Fitch has been criticised in some quarters as an example of poor corporate governance, since he holds no official position within the company. Smith's presence ending up became a factor in Jeffries being ousted as CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch in 2014. Controversies In October 2012, Bloomberg News first reported on Jeffries' standards for his cabin crew on Abercrombie's Gulfstream G-V Jet, used by Jeffries, Smith and their dogs. The male models who work as stewards aboard the company jet are required to wear Abercrombie-branded polos, jeans, boxer briefs and flip-flops as part of their uniform, as well as a \\"spritz\\" of cologne. This information then came to light as a result of a lawsuit that claimed Jeffries fired his own jet pilot in order to replace him with a much younger man. The suit was quickly settled out of court when Jeffries was ordered to testify by the presiding judge. Male house staff for Jeffries, paid for by the Jeffries Family Office, is provided by the same modeling firm that supplies male staff for the company jet. In a 2006 interview with Salon, he stated that his clothing line is exclusively for \\"cool\\" people. Moreover, he has said he does not want overweight or unattractive people to wear his clothes.Denizet-Lewis, Benoit (January 24, 2006). \\"The man behind Abercrombie & Fitch\\". Salon.

She was born in 1579 of humble parents at Pibrac, a village 15 km from Toulouse. Of her, the Catholic Encyclopedia writes: > \\"From her birth she seemed marked out for suffering; she came into the world > with a deformed hand and the disease of scrofula, and, while yet an infant, > lost her mother. Her father soon married again, but his second wife treated > Germaine with much cruelty. Under pretence of saving the other children from > the contagion of scrofula she persuaded the father to keep Germaine away > from the homestead, and thus the child was employed almost from infancy as a > shepherdess. When she returned at night, her bed was in the stable or on a > litter of vine branches in a garret. In this hard school Germaine learned > early to practise humility and patience. She was gifted with a marvellous > sense of the presence of God and of spiritual things, so that her lonely > life became to her a source of light and blessing. To poverty, bodily > infirmity, the rigours of the seasons, the lack of affection from those in > her own home, she added voluntary mortifications and austerities, making > bread and water her daily food. Her love for Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament > and for His Virgin Mother presaged the saint. She assisted daily at the Holy > Sacrifice; when the bell rang, she fixed her sheep-hook or distaff in the > ground, and left her flocks to the care of Providence while she heard Mass. > Although the pasture was on the border of a forest infested with wolves, no > harm ever came to her flocks.\\" She is said to have practised many austerities as reparation for the sacrileges perpetrated by heretics in the neighbouring churches. She frequented the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist, and it was observed that her piety increased on the approach of every feast of Our Lady. The Rosary was her only book, and her devotion to the Angelus was so great that she used to fall on her knees at the first sound of the bell, even though she heard it when crossing a stream. The villagers are said to have inclined at first to treat her piety with mild derision, until certain signs of God's signal favour made her an object of reverence and awe. The ford in winter, after heavy rains or the melting of snow, was at times impassable. On several occasions the swollen waters were seen to open and afford her a passage without wetting her garments. Notwithstanding her poverty she found means to help the poor by sharing with them her allowance of bread. Her father at last came to a sense of his duty, forbade her stepmother henceforth to treat her harshly, and wished to give her a place in the home with his other children, but Germaine begged to be allowed to remain in the humbler position. At this point, when men were beginning to realize the beauty of her life, she died. One morning in the early summer of 1601, her father found that she had not risen at the usual hour and went to call her, finding her dead on her pallet of vine-twigs. She was 22 years old at the time. Relics and veneration Reliquary of the Holy Her remains were buried in the parish church of Pibrac in front of the pulpit. In 1644, when the grave was opened to receive one of her relatives, the body of Germaine was discovered fresh and perfectly preserved, and miraculously raised almost to the level of the floor of the church. It was exposed for public view near the pulpit, until a noble lady, the wife of François de Beauregard, presented as a thanks-offering a casket of lead to hold the remains. She had been cured of a malignant and incurable ulcer in the breast, and her infant son whose life was despaired of was restored to health on her seeking the intercession of Germaine. This was the first of a long series of wonderful cures wrought at her relics. The leaden casket was placed in the sacristy, and in 1661 and 1700 the remains were viewed and found fresh and intact by the vicars-general of Toulouse, who have left testamentary depositions of the fact. Expert medical evidence deposed that the body had not been embalmed, and experimental tests showed that the preservation was not due to any property inherent in the soil. In 1700 a movement was begun to procure the beatification of Germaine, but it fell through owing to accidental causes. In 1793 the casket was desecrated by a revolutionary tinsmith, named Toulza, who with three accomplices took out the remains and buried them in the sacristy, throwing quick-lime and water on them. After the Revolution, her body was found to be still intact save where the quick-lime had done its work. The private veneration of Germaine had continued from the original finding of the body in 1644, supported and encouraged by numerous cures and miracles. The cause of beatification was resumed in 1850. The documents attested more than 400 miracles or extraordinary graces, and thirty postulatory letters from archbishops and bishops in France besought the beatification from the Holy See. The miracles attested were cures of every kind (of blindness, congenital and resulting from disease, of hip and spinal disease), besides the multiplication of food for the distressed community of the Good Shepherd at Bourges in 1845. On 7 May 1854, Pius IX proclaimed her beatification, and on 29 June 1867, placed her on the canon of virgin saints. Her feast is kept in the Diocese of Toulouse on 15 June. She is represented in art with a shepherd's crook or with a distaff; with a watchdog, or a sheep; or with flowers in her apron.

Thunderbirds (1965-66) Background John was originally intended to be play a larger role in Thunderbirds, but after creator Gerry Anderson took a dislike to the character he ended up appearing less often than planned. He was the first of the Tracy brothers to be voice-cast. Actor Ray Barrett was so impressed with the marionette, whose face was modeled on singer Adam Faith and actor Charlton Heston, that he immediately advised co-producer Sylvia Anderson that he wanted to play the studious young astronaut with the boyish quiff. Character biography The third son of Jeff Tracy (founder and financier of International Rescue), John was named after astronaut John Glenn. Sources vary in the canon of the Thunderbirds series as to John's age and birth date, although one written source suggests that he was born on 28 October 2002 or 2041—this would make him the third son. The majority of sources and two decades of Thunderbirds calendars cite John's birthday as 8 October and he is 24 years of age. Chris Bentley, author of The Complete Book of Thunderbirds, erroneously cited Gerry Anderson as the source of the misinformation about the birth order of the Tracy brothers, but later admitted that he was using the order of the brothers as shown in the credits. Most sourcebooks on Thunderbirds prior to the Complete book noted that the birth order matches the number of the Thunderbirds ships, save that the third brother (John) and fifth brother (Alan) trade shifts aboard their respective crafts. Also, the novel Operation: Asteroids from 1965 clearly states that Scott and Virgil are \\"Jeff's eldest sons\\". John is a noted scholar of astronomy, and has authored several popular astronomy textbooks. He is a graduate of Harvard University with a degree in Advanced Telecommunications. John's quiet intellectual nature and interest in astronomy make him the natural choice for the solitary life as the occupant of space station Thunderbird 5, monitoring for distress calls from around the world. He has only ever been seen physically involved in a rescue during the episode \\"Danger at Ocean Deep\\", although he reveals in a conversation with his father in that same episode that he has already been on a \\"dozen\\" rescues. According to Carlton Books' Lady Penelope's Secrets, John is known to be exceedingly patient, kindly and gracious and possessed of both great intelligence and poise as gifts inherited from his talented mother. Thunderbirds (2004 film) Lex Shrapnel portrayed John in the 2004 live- action film. Owing to the film focusing on Alan Tracy, little is known about this version of John. A brief scene between him and his father Jeff Tracy shows that, like his 1960s counterpart, he is a kind and patient person, because he listens to and provides encouragement for Jeff who is concerned about Alan's behaviour. Over the course of the film, John is nearly killed by the Hood, who launches a missile at Thunderbird 5, in order to lure International Rescue away from their base and allow him to steal their equipment. Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series) In the 2015 series, John is still the 'pilot' of Thunderbird 5, but his role is greatly expanded beyond simply receiving calls for help, often providing aid in coordinating the rescue missions via long-distance communication. He is voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster and is now a redhead, instead of being a blond (he and Gordon have traded hair colours). John is shown as being an emotional introvert, who prefers spending his spare time eating bagels, watching TV (his favourite show is Stingray) and stargazing. He is generally a loner, who doesn't like having to spend more time on Earth than he has to, as he's now the lone operator of TB5 until EOS comes, a program that he designed by himself. Carolyn Percy of the Wales Arts Review comments that because he was disliked by Gerry Anderson, the original John was the least developed Tracy brother. She considers the new John to be \\"something of a breakout character\\", also noting that the series characterises him as a \\"slightly anti-social loner\\".

The concept of fitness to plead also applies in Scots and Irish law.\\"During the period 1946 to 1962 ... 34 were found insane and unfit to plead\\" Its United States equivalent is competence to stand trial. Test If the issue of fitness to plead is raised, a judge is able to find a person unfit to plead. This is usually done based on information following a psychiatric evaluation. In England and Wales the legal test of fitness to plead is based on the ruling of Alderson B. in R v Pritchard. The accused will be unfit to plead if they are unable: * to comprehend the course of proceedings on the trial, so as to make a proper defence; or * to know that they might challenge any jurors to whom they may object; or * to comprehend the evidence; or * to give proper instructions to their legal representatives.Prichard (1836) 7 C & P 303. If the issue is raised by the prosecution, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is unfit to plead.Robertson [1968] 1 WLR 1767. If the issue is raised by the defence, it need only be proved on the balance of probabilities.Podola [1960] 1 QB 325. In Scotland the test is based on HMA v Wilson, and has two elements: * to be able to instruct counsel and * to understand and follow proceedings.HM Advocate V Wilson [1942] J. C. 75 Procedure The question of unfitness to plead is determined by a judge.Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, (as amended by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, ). The decision should normally be made as soon as it arises,Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, . which would ordinarily be before arraignment, but the court may postpone consideration of unfitness until any time before the opening of the defence case. This power might be used to allow the defence to challenge the prosecution case on the basis that there is no case to answer. If the judge determines that the defendant is unfit to plead, evidence will be heard and the jury will be asked to determine whether he did the act or made the omission charged against him as the offence.Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, . This process avoids the detention of innocent persons in hospital merely because they are mentally unfit. It has been held that the reference to the \\"act or omission\\" means that the jury should not normally consider whether the defendant had the requisite mens rea. If the jury find that the defendant is unfit to plead, the judge may: * make a guardianship order within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983; * make a supervision and treatment order within the meaning of Schedule 2 to the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991; or * make an order for his absolute discharge.Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, . Criticism There is a dearth of research into fitness to plead in the UK, with no prospective studies and no studies involving the comparison of fit and unfit subjects. In particular, there have been no investigations into the meaning of ‘unfit to plead’ in terms of psychiatric symptomatology, or as to the relative importance of each legal fitness criterion in psychiatrists' conclusions as to fitness.CJO - Abstract - Fitness to plead. A prospective study of the inter-relationships between expert opinion, legal criteria and specific symptomatology An appraisal of the use of the legal test for fitness to plead in England found that 40% of psychiatric court reports did not mention fitness to plead at all, and that only a third made a statement about fitness to plead that was supported by reference to the legal criteria.Larkin, E., Collins, P. (1989). Fitness to plead and psychiatric reports. Medicine, science and law, 29, 26-32.

The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology, 19:4,597-602 Other jurisdictions address issues of a defendant's ability to meaningfully participate in the proceedings in a variety of ways. For example, in New York, if a defendant's capacity to understand the proceedings and participate in his or her defense is in question, the court will order that the defendant be examined by two independent medical professionals and conduct a hearing to consider the medical evidence, a procedure known as a \\"730 examination\\" as it is governed by Section 730 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law.

Umar was the second Rashidun Caliph and reigned during 634-644. Umar's caliphate is notable for its vast conquests, aided by brilliant field commanders, he was able to incorporate present day Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, and part of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and south western Pakistan into the Caliphate. During his reign, the Byzantines lost more than three fourths of their territory and in Persia, the Sassanid empire ceased to exist.A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims on Al- Islam.org Conquest of Eastern Roman Empire Conquest of Levant (634-638) Muslim forces invaded the neighboring Eastern Roman Empire in 634 soon after Conquest of Iraq in 633 during the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr. Damascus fell in September 634 and Emesa fell in March 635. In the year 635, Emperor Heraclius successfully allied with Sassanid Persian Emperor Yazdegerd III on Yazdegerd III's request to crush the Muslim power. A well coordinated plan was agreed to launch a massive counterattack against Muslims in Iraq and Syria at once so that Muslims, because of the resulted pressure may retreat back to Arabia where they may be dealt in detail later, either by invading it or by economical and trade blockage. Caliph Umar successfully tackled the alliance by putting pressure tactics on Byzantine front and deceptive tactics on Persian front and engaging Yazdegerd III into negotiations, this rendered the alliance and a would be decisive plan abortive. The Byzantine forces were decisively defeated in Battle of Yarmouk fought in August 636, Persian army was defeated in Battle of Qadisiyyah three months later in November 636. Muslim victory pertinently ended Byzantine rule south of Anatolia, and Jerusalem fell in April 637 after a prolonged siege, Umar personally came to receive the key to the city by the Greek Orthodox patriarch, Sophronius, and was invited to offer prayers at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Umar chose to pray some distance from the Church, so as not to endanger its status as a Christian temple. Fifty-five years later, the Mosque of Omar was constructed on the site where he prayed.For one version of \`Umar's speech to the people after the surrender of Jerusalem, see . After the fall of Jerusalem, Umar permitted Jews to practice their religion freely and live in Jerusalem. (See: Covenant of Umar I) The conquest of Levant was completed in 637 after the last relentless resistance by Byzantines at Battle of Iron bridge, that resulted in Muslim occupation of Antioch, capital of eastern zone of Byzantine Empire in October 637. Emperor Heraclius attempt to capture northern Syria in 638, with the aid of Christian Arabs of Jazira, prompted Muslims to invade Jazira (Mesopotamia) in 638 and captured it securing the eastern flank of Syria from Byzantine attacks in future, soon after occupation of Jazira, Muslim columns marched north in Anatolia, invaded and plundered Byzantine provinces of Armenia, these were however only preemptive attacks on Armenia to eliminate all Byzantine presence north of Syria, Armenia was annexed in 643 During the Conquest of Persian Empire. These preemptive attack resulted in the creation of a buffer zone or no man's land in south-eastern Anatolia and Armenia, which would eventually evolve into the al-'Awasim. It was exactly what Umar wanted,kegri as he is quoted saying The Byzantine empire already exhausted after major defeats in Yarmouk and Northern Syria was left vulnerable to Muslims attacks and its very existence in Anatolia was threatened. Umar, apparently was not interested in occupation of Anatolia, it had a cold and mountainous terrain with no economic incentives, soon after the occupation of Byzantine Armenia, the time when chaos was at its peak in Byzantium, Umar had already rejected Khalid and Abu Ubaidah's proposal of invading Anatolia. More over Umar, due to his strong desire to consolidate his rule in the conquered land and owing to his non-offensive policy left the remaining Byzantine empire on its own. The situation was a stalemate, Umar had power but not desire to cross into Byzantine Empire, and Emperor Heraclius had desire but not left powerful enough to roll back his former rich provinces. For the security of northern Syria, Umar issued orders for annual raids into Byzantine territories in Anatolia and Muslims raided as far as Phrygia. Conquest of Egypt (640-642) After losing Levat, the economic life line of Byzantines and Armenia, the manpower hub, Emperor Heraclius was left incapable of any military come back, he rather focused to consolidate his power in Egypt. In his visit to Syria in 637 to receive surrender of Jerusalem, Amr ibn al-Aas tried to convince Umar for the invasion of Egypt, but Umar rejected on the ground that Muslim rule in Syria was still not firm. After the great plague in 639, Umar paid a visit to Syria and was again persuaded by Amr for the invasion of Egypt. Along with various other reasons, Amr convinced Umar that Byzantine influence in Egypt is a continuous threat to Muslim rule in Palestine and that Egypt is the richest land on earth that can provide Muslims with immense wealth, economical stability and strategic location for trade with North Africa and Mediterranean. Initially hesitant for the expedition Umar rejected the proposal and is reported to have said: But eventually decided to put the matter in Majlis al Shura (parliament) in Madinah. Once approved by the parliament Umar issued orders for the invasion of Egypt in December 639 which completed in 642 at the eve of Muslim conquest of Persian highlands. Dismissal of Khalid from army (638) See: Khalid's dismissal from army In late 638, following Khalid's invasion of Byzantine Armenia in eastern Anatolia, Khalid was dismissed from army by Umar. The exact reason remained unknown, but various scholars including Muslims and non-Muslims argue that Khalid's dismissal from army at zenith of his power was due to the fact that muslims started having faith in Khalid's command rather than God for being victorious which worried Umar, who saw this as a threat to religious believes of Muslims which says only to rely on God. Also a poet wrote some poetry on Khalid's bravery and Khalid being impressed, gave him some award. When Umer learned about it, he called Khalid and said, Khalid, on his return from an expedition of Amida and Edessa was charged for embezzlement and thus was dismissed from army. Khalid's removal created a strong wrath among the people on the ground that Khalid, a national hero was mistreated by the Caliph and it was unjust to remove him from the army. In addition to this some supporters of Khalid embolden him to rebel against Umar's discriminatory decision but Khalid, though more than able to rebel chose to accept the decision.On his dismissal, Khalid didn't said a single word and accepted the decision of Caliph by heart.After that Khalid fought all battles of his life as a soldier. Had Khalid revolted a bloody civil war would be inevitable. Khalid visited Madinah and met Umar who is reported to have given Khalid a prestigious tribute saying: due to his act of dismissing Khalid, Umar was highly criticized publicly. Umar thus explained his dismissal of Khalid as: From Madinah Khalid went to Emesa and died after less than 4 years in 642 at the eve of Muslim conquest of Persia. During Hajj of the year 642 Umar decided to reappoint Khalid to the army services, he most probably intended to have Khalid's services for the invasion of main land Persia, like Caliph Abu Bakr did during his first foreign expedition, the conquest of Iraq by using Khalid as a guaranteed victor for Persian front to boost up moral of Muslims for further such expeditions, his abilities and military prowess could also be used this time as a sure victory more over his presence could also boost up the moral of Muslim army invading Persia and his formidable reputation as a psychological weapon against Persians. Umar reached Madinah after Hajj only to receive the news of Khalid death that broke like a storm over Medinah. The women took to the streets, led by the women of the Banu Makhzum (Khalid's tribe), wailing and beating their chests. Though Umar, from very first day had given orders that there would be no wailing for departed Muslims, but in this one case he made an exception. Umar reportedly said: Umar is reported to have later regretted over his decision of dismissing Khalid from army, accepting the fact that he (Khalid) was not like as he (Umar) though of him. On his death bed, Umar is also reported to have wished that beside Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, if Khalid would be alive he would have appointed him his successor.

Conquest of Sassanid Persian Empire Conquest of Iraq Winged sphinx from the palace of Darius the Great at Susa, captured by Rashidun general Abu Musa in 641. Abu Bakr became caliph in 632 and triumphed in Ridda wars thus conquering Arabia by early 633. Soon after Ridda wars Abu Bakr started a war of conquest by invading neighboring rich and fertile Iraq, a province of Sassanid Empire where its capital Ctesiphon situated. Muslims under Khalid ibn Walid captured Iraq after decisive Battle of Ullais. In June 634 Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr to Roman front in Syria to command Muslim armies in Syria. Khalid left with half of his army which left Muslim position in Iraq dangerously exposed to Persian counterattack. Misna ibn Haris, Khalid's successor, evacuated Iraq and camped near Arabian Desert after Persian counterattack. Umar soon sent reinforcement, to strengthen the position in Iraq, which was finally defeated in Battle of Bridge in October 635. Emperor Yazdegerd III sought help from his Byzantine counterpart Emperor Heraclius, who married his granddaughter to Yazdegerd III, an old Roman tradition to seal the alliance. Planned to overpower Umar, their common enemy, both emperors started preparations for a massive coordinated counterattack at once on their respected front to crush the threat in Arabia once for good. This alliance resulted in a bloody year of 636 in which Battle of Yarmouk in Syria and Battle of Qadisiyyah in Iraq resulted in decisive Muslim victory. Followed the victory at Qadisiyyah, Muslims captured Ctesiphon, the Sassanid Persian capital city, after two-month siege in March 637 followed by capturing of Tikrit and Mosul. Umar wanted Zagros mountains to be the frontiers between Muslims and Persians and is quoted saying Persians kept on raiding Iraq, which resulted in political instability in Iraq, as a result Muslims invaded Ahvaz in 638 which forced powerful Persian commander in chief, Hormuzan, to enter into peace negotiations with Muslims. Hormuzan agreed to accept Muslim suzerainty over Ahvaz province and agreed to rule as Muslim's vassal. Hormuzan broke peace agreement three time and each time was pardoned by Caliph Umar and the peace renewed, until the third time when on Umar's instructions his capital was besieged and he was taken prisoner and sent to Madinah to umar, where he apparently accepted Islam. He later allegedly masterminded Umar's assassination. In 641 Persians under Yazdegerd III managed to muster up a massive army to attack Iraq, this army was defeated in Battle of Nahāvand in December 642. Conquest of mainland Persia (642-644) After the battle Umar changed his policy towards Sassanid Persian Empire, Yazdegerd III, who unlike his Roman counterpart Heraclius, denied submission to Muslim supremacy in his land, was a constant threat for Caliphate, Umar decided to launch a whole scale invasion of Sassanid Persian Empire to eliminate this threat. After a devastating defeat at Nihawand, last Sassanid emperor Yazdgerd III, a man with iron nerves, was never to be able again to raise more troops to resist the mighty onslaught of Umar, it had now became a war between two rulers, Umar will follow Yazdgerd III to every corner of his empire either will kill him or will capture him, like he did with Hormuzan. Yazdgerd III would have a narrow escape at Marv when Umar’s lieutenant was to capture him after Battle of Oxus river, he would save his life only by fleeing to China, far enough from reach of Umar, thus effectively ending the 400-year-old Sassanid dynasty.Iranian History and Politics: The Dialectic of State and Society By Homa Katouzian, pg. 25 In 642, Umar launched multi-prong expeditions into Persia, first capturing Isfahan province thus cutting off the northern province of Azerbaijan and southern province of Fars from main empire. in the second phase capturing Azerbaijan and fars thus isolating Yazdegerd III's stronghold Khurasan. The third phase further isolated Khurasan by capturing Kirman, Sistan and Makran in south while Persian Armenia in north. Fourth and last phase started in early 644 with the invasion of Khurasan. After a Decisive Battle of Oxus river, Yazdegerd III fled to central Asia and Persian Empire ceased to exist. Umar's conquest of Sassanid Persian empire by commanding the operations, while sitting about 1000 kilometer away from the battle fields, will become the greatest triumph of Umar and his strategic marvel, and marked his reputation as one of the greatest military and political genius of history, like his late cousin Khalid ibn Walid (590 – 642).The Muslim Conquest of Persia By A.I.

Conkling studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, Dartmouth College, Brigham Young University.California State University, Dominguez Hills, and California State University, Northridge from which he received his teaching credentials. He wrote six complete scripts in an attempt to find the right approach for Bakshi's version of Lord of the Rings—one covered only a third of the epic, one tried to fit the entire saga into a single film, one tried to cut it in half; one version even focused on a re-telling by Pippin and Merry. There was a good deal of experimentation as to how to approach the enormous saga. Eventually, popular science fiction novelist, Peter S. Beagle, was called in to do some revisions, although Conkling still retained first credit on the final version. Lord of the Rings was nominated for a Hugo Award.

Cox was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Though primarily a punter and kickoff specialist, Cox was also used for long field goal attempts. On October 21, 1984, Cox kicked a 60-yard field goal in a game against Cincinnati. The kick was the second-longest field goal at the time (behind Tom Dempsey's record kick), but has since been matched by Morten Andersen, Rob Bironas, and Dan Carpenter and surpassed by Justin Tucker, Jason Elam, Matt Bryant, David Akers and twice by Sebastian Janikowski.

The character also appeared in the live action movie Thunderbirds. Thunderbirds (1965-66) Born on 14 February 2004 or 2043, Gordon Tracy revels in all aquatic sports, from skin-diving to water-skiing. Named after astronaut Leroy Gordon Cooper, he is a highly trained aquanaut, with stints in the Submarine Service and the World Aquanaut Security Patrol under his belt. During his time with the WASPs, Gordon commanded a deep-sea bathyscaphe and spent a year beneath the ocean investigating marine farming methods. An expert oceanographer, he is also the designer of a unique underwater breathing apparatus, which he has modified and improved for International Rescue. Shortly before International Rescue began operating, Gordon was involved in a hydrofoil speedboat crash when his vessel capsized at 400 knots. The craft was completely shattered and Gordon spent four months in a hospital bed. Now, as the pilot of Thunderbird 4, he commands the world's most advanced and versatile one-man submarine. Good-natured and high-spirited, he possesses a strength and tenacity that make him a respected leader and commander. He is also one of the world's fastest freestyle swimmers and is a past Olympic champion at the butterfly stroke. In addition to being the pilot of Thunderbird 4, Gordon is also the co-pilot of Thunderbird 2, and thus often accompanies Virgil. Of all the family, Gordon is the funny one, which gives him a tendency to get into trouble with Jeff over his flippant sense of humour. For example, in \\"Day of Disaster\\", somebody has taken Grandma's personal edible transmitter, and Gordon proves his innocence when he says he'd know if he'd taken a transmitter, but Jeff gets annoyed. Gordon's favourite pastimes are playing chess (often with Scott or Brains), going fishing and playing the guitar. Thunderbirds (2004) Ben Torgeson plays Gordon in the live-action adaptation of Thunderbirds. However, since the movie entirely focuses on a 14-year-old version of Alan, nothing is known of this Gordon. Thunderbirds Are Go! (2015) David Menkin plays Gordon in the 2015 CGI redux of Thunderbirds, entitled Thunderbirds Are Go!. He is now a blonde, instead of being a redhead (he and John have traded hair colours, as have Scott and Virgil). As well as piloting Thunderbird 4, he also pilots various devices flown around by Thunderbird 2, such as the new Elevator Cars in \\"Fireflash\\". Again, he's the funny one, and is also described as having a loud voice, dwarfed only by his clothing tastes. His IR outfit now has a scuba- diving mouthpiece attached to his now-yellow sash (it was orange in the original series). Similar to his older brother John he seems to have been given a romantic interest in the reboot - in Gordon's case Lady Penelope. Carolyn Percy of the Wales Arts Review comments that whereas the 1960s puppet character was one of the least developed Tracy brothers, this version of Gordon is characterised as a \\"light-hearted joker\\".

This article details the reforms of Umar's era. Umar undertook many administrative reforms and closely oversaw public policy, establishing an advanced administration for newly conquered lands, including several new ministries and bureaucracies, as well as ordering a census of all the Muslim territories. During his reign, the garrison cities of Basrah and al-Kūfah were founded or expanded. In 638, he extended and renovated the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. He also began the process of codifying Islamic law. Reforms Political Umar was first to establish a special department for the investigation of complaints against the officers of the State. This department acted as Administrative court, where the legal proceedings were personally led by Umar.Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought, M. A. Cook, page no:79 The Department was under the charge of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, one of Umar's most trusted men. In important cases Muhammad ibn Maslamah was deputed by Umar to proceed to the spot, investigate the charge and take action. Sometimes an Inquiry Commission was constituted to investigate the charge. On occasions the officers against whom complaints were received were summoned to Medina, and charged in Umar's administrative court. Umar was known for this intelligence service through which he made his officials accountable This service was also said to have inspired fear in his subjects. On discovery of any scandal on the part of any official, an investigation through a special department of accountability headed by Muhammad ibn Maslamah would be carried out and if the official would prove guilty he was immediately deposed from his office and his punishment was vary from publicly humiliating punishments to flogging. Before appointment, all financial assets and details of the political officer used to be recorded and were checked each year. Military Caliph Umar organized the army as a State department. This reform was introduced in 637 A.D. A beginning was made with the Quraish and the Ansars and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands. A register of all adults who could be called to war was prepared, and a scale of salaries was fixed. All men registered were liable to military service. They were divided into two categories, namely: # Those who formed the regular standing army; and #Those that lived in their homes, but were liable to be called to the colors whenever needed. The pay was paid in the beginning of the month of Muharram. The allowances were paid during the harvesting season. The armies of the Caliphs were mostly paid in cash salaries. In contrast to many post-Roman polities in Europe, grants of land, or of rights to collect taxes directly from the payers, were of only minor importance. A major consequence of this was that the army directly depended on the state for its subsistence which, in turn, meant that the military had to control the state apparatus.The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State. Contributors: Hugh Kennedy - author. Publisher: Routledge. Place of Publication: London. Publication Year: 2001. Page Number:59 Promotions in the army were made on the strength of the length of service or exceptional merit. Officership was an appointment and not a rank. Officers were appointed to command for the battle or the campaign; and once the operation was concluded, they could well find themselves in the ranks again. Leave of absence was given to army men at regular intervals. The troops stationed at far off places were given leave after four months. Each army corps was accompanied by an officer of the treasury, an Accountant, a Qadi, and a number of interpreters besides a number of Physicians and Surgeons. Expeditions were undertaken according to seasons. Expeditions in cold countries were undertaken during the summer, and in hot countries in winter. Umar established military cantonments on strategic positions throughout the empire to deal with any emergency efficiently and quickly. The garrison towns of Kufa, Busra and Fustat were founded by Umar. They were also provincial capitals of their respective provinces. Social The concepts of welfare and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of Zakat (charity tax), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, under Umar in the 7th century. The taxes (including Zakat and Jizya) collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. The Caliphate can thus be considered the world's first major welfare state. (see online) Religious Mohammad initially prayed the tarawih, a special Muslim prayers during the month of Ramadan, in congregation but later discontinued this practice out of fear that Muslims would start to believe the prayers to be mandatory, rather than a sunnah.Sahih Muslim, Book #4, Hadith #1,663 During his Caliphate Umar reinstated the practice of praying tarawih in congregation as there was no longer any fear of people taking it as something mandatory.Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book #32, Hadith #227 See also * Nikah mut‘ah * Salat al-Janazah * Divorce_in_Islam * Early social changes under Islam References Category:Umar ","title":"Reforms of Umar's era"},{"id":"8154409","text":"Stephanoaetus is a genus of very large birds of prey from Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar.

The Windows version of DX implements a file-system filter driver that intercepts user mode I/O requests. These intercepted requests are then processed by DX components. If necessary, files are fetched off of secondary storage media and then passed back to the calling applications. Otherwise, if no processing is necessary, the filter driver does nothing and simply passes the request through the stack of lower level drivers. Other applications that implement similar architecture in terms of file system filters include anti-virus and file system replication software. In 2003, DiskXtender was one of the three information lifecycle management offerings from EMC after EMC acquired Legato System. The remaining products were EmailXtender and DatabaseXtender which archive email and databases correspondingly. DiskXtender, by intercepting I/O from operating system, is capable of detecting inactive data and then migrating those data to secondary and/or tertiary storage with lower cost/GBs while still maintaining transparency to both applications and end users.

It is the only General Baptist Church-affiliated college or university in the United States. Founded in 1885, it has slowly grown to the present student enrollment of about 1,200 on the main campus and, counting all sites, about 2,000 total. OCU's athletics teams, known as the Oaks, play in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the River States Conference. In addition to the institution's Oakland City main campus, the university has satellite campuses in Evansville, Indianapolis, Rockport and Bedford. The Bedford branch is housed in the former headquarters of the Indiana Limestone Company. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. These sites utilize the adult learning model that emphasizes experiential application to objectives and theory. Students from a wide age range attend OCU. Courses are provided in an accelerated pace and condensed format, much like how summer school operates in more traditional programs. Students may take one or two courses at a time and enroll as full-time. History In June 1885, the Educational Board of General Baptists organized and then gained a charter from the state of Indiana to operate a college at Oakland City. However, because of a lack of funds, the first building, a two-story brick structure housing the administration and classrooms, was not complete until 1891--the same year Oakland City College opened its doors for classes. In those early days, the school was called \\"the college on the hill.\\" By the mid-1920s, the school had reached a zenith for the first half of the century. There were several college buildings gracing the grounds, including an expanded administration building, Wheatley Hall, a women's dorm, a field house, Memorial Gym (which housed a library in the basement), Cronbach Hall, a building used for agricultural and industrial arts classes, and a two-story brick building called the president's house. Beside the normal, liberal arts and theological school, the college had added a large industrial and agricultural department to respond to the vocational needs of the rural area it served. The college offered several sports and clubs, and enrollment during this period often exceeded 1,000 students a semester. The Great Depression hit the school hard, and faculty and staff often forwent paychecks to keep the school running. The end of World War II and the GI Bill saw a resurgence in enrollment and, by the mid-1960s, the \\"college on the hill\\" experienced an upswing comparable to the 1920s. Several new buildings were constructed on the campus including four dormitories, a new library, Brengle Hall, a science building, and Stinson Hall. By the fall term of 1973, enrollment had dropped considerably. The sponsoring denomination, the General Baptists, made a successful effort to raise funds to keep the school open and hired James Murray as the college president. In the 1990s the college moved to university status under Murray's leadership. Presently the school has an enrollment of 2,000 and has seen the construction of six new buildings in the last few years. Today, the university stands fully accredited and offers five graduate degrees and over 40 undergraduate programs. Academics Oakland City University is accredited by the following: * The Higher Learning Commission * Higher Learning Commission Mark of Affiliation * International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (Main Campus Business programs) * The Association of Theological Schools Athletics Oakland City teams participate as a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).

In March 2020, the university was approved for membership into the NAIA and it was simultaneously announced that the Mighty Oaks would begin competition in the River States Conference starting in the 2020–21 academic year. The university was a previous member of the NAIA and the River States Conference, then known as Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC).

In 1988, the Hockey Hall of Fame presented him with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, for his contributions to hockey broadcasting. In 2004, he was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Broadcasting career Dick Irvin is a graduate of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree from what is now the Desautels Faculty of Management. While attending university from 1951 to 1953, Irvin played for the varsity hockey team and worked part-time as an assistant to the equipment manager of the Montreal Canadiens, the team his father coached at the time. After several years in commerce, he turned to sports broadcasting, first as a media liaison for the Canadiens and then, starting in 1966, a colour commentator on their radio and television broadcasts, alongside play-by-play announcer Danny Gallivan and color commentator Mickey Redmond. From the late 1970s through the 1980s, he acted as both the colour commentator and studio host for Hockey Night in Canada (HNIC) telecasts from Montreal. This meant that he missed the beginnings and ends of periods as he moved from ice level to the broadcast booth and back. Gallivan often playfully addressed him as \\"Richard\\", even though his used name is a diminutive of Dickinson. After Gallivan's retirement in 1984, he worked as the play-by-play broadcaster for regional games from Montreal, and as a secondary colour commentator (or \\"third man\\" in the booth) for national games. He also provided radio play-by-play commentary for Canadiens' games that were not on HNIC until 1997. At his retirement, he was the longest-serving member of CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada, with a broadcasting career spanning from 1966 to 1999. Though retired, Irvin still contributes yearly to the annual \\"Hockey Day in Canada\\" broadcast, along with other occasional appearances. For example, he was part of CBC's broadcast crew of the first Heritage Classic game from Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton on November 22, 2003, as the festivities included a game between Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers alumni teams. Then on December 4, 2009, he returned to co-host the Montreal Canadiens centennial pre-game ceremony along with long-time French-language broadcaster Richard Garneau, introducing many of the former Canadiens participating in the event as they arrived onto the ice. Irvin is a fount of hockey knowledge, having spent a lifetime in the game. His record for longevity with Hockey Night in Canada has since been surpassed by Bob Cole. Irvin was also the sports director of CFCF radio and CFCF-TV, a CTV affiliate in Montreal. Honours In 2013, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada \\"for his contributions to hockey as a beloved broadcaster and author, as well as for his charitable activities.\\" Books Irvin wrote six books during his broadcasting career and one after his retirement. These books are Now Back to You, Dick (1988), The Habs (1991), Behind the Bench (1993), In the Crease (1995), Tough Calls (1997) and My 26 Stanley Cups (2001). Personal life Although known as Dick Irvin Jr., he is the third generation to be named James Dickinson Irvin, after his father and grandfather. Irvin's father, known as Dick Irvin Sr., was a noted NHL player and coach. He has two children named Doug and Nancy. His wife, Wilma, died in 2003.

In 1901 he married Susan Emily Naegueli, a 42-year-old divorcee, and settled at Caermarthen station, Manilla, New South Wales, which was home to Susan's parents. Henry Burrell with his portable platypusary He set up a small native zoo and became interested in the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, which he had been told could not be kept in captivity. He spent much of his time studying the platypus on the rivers surrounding the station: the Namoi, Manilla and Macdonald. He captured some specimens and managed to keep them alive in a portable artificial habitat of his own devising, which he christened a \\"platypusary\\". He made the first exhibition of the platypus at the Moore Park Zoological Gardens (moved and renamed Taronga Zoological Gardens in 1917) in 1910, and with Ellis Stanley Joseph he took the first live platypuses to be seen outside Australia to the United States in 1922. He was also the first person to successfully keep a baby platypus in captivity. His interest extended to the other monotremes, the echidnas, and he made a film showing the habits of both monotremes. He made recordings of their vocalizations and contributed articles on the monotremes to the Australian Encyclopedia. In 1926 he published The Wild Animals of Australasia (with A. S. Le Souef) and in the next year, The Platypus, its Discovery, Zoological Position Form and Characteristics, Habits, Life History, etc. It was regarded as the authoritative work on the species despite Burrell being denied official sanction and hence being restricted in his area of study. In 1927 Burrell was stricken with paralysis; he recovered, but moved to Sydney to continue working. Burrell was a regular contributor to scientific journals. He was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London and of the Australian Museum, and a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales amongst other memberships of learned societies; he collected specimens for the University of Sydney and the Commonwealth government. In 1937 he received an OBE. His wife died in 1941, and in 1942 Burrell married Daisy Ellen Brown. Burrell died suddenly of heart disease on 29 July 1945 at his home at Randwick, New South Wales. His collection of photographic negatives was donated to the Australian Museum, and his unique complete sequence of monotreme exhibits to the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. Thylacine Burrell is credited with a notorious 1921 photo of a thylacine (or Tasmanian tiger), showing it standing in the bush with a chicken in its mouth. Robert Paddle, author of The Last Tasmanian Tiger: The History and Extinction of the Thylacine, credits this picture with adding much to the reputation of the thylacine as a poultry killer. The image was published in the Australian Museum Magazine and The Wild Animals of Australasia.The Australian Museum Magazine 1:3 1921; Le Souef, A. S. and Burrell, H. 1926. The Wild Animals of Australasia; embracing New Guinea and the nearer Pacific Islands. George Harrap. Sydney, NSW. Burrell's original photo clearly shows that the animal was captive, but the version that appeared in the newspaper was cropped to remove these details. Researcher Carol Freeman analysed the photo and concluded that the thylacine shown was a mounted specimen, posed for the camera with the bird in its mouth. However, the notion that the thylacine was a taxidermied mount was challenged by Robert Paddle in 2008. Paddle believed that the thylacine was a living specimen from Hobart's Beaumaris Zoo.

It premiered on November 23, 2006.  Plot  Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends is having their annual five-year reunion with their creators. However, Wilt decides to run away. This results in a chase around the world, in which Bloo, Mac, Eduardo, Coco, Frankie and the foster creators Douglas, Adam, and police officer Nina Valerosa attempt to bring Wilt back home. Along the way, Wilt gets off track when he helps out a variety of individuals in a town. Eventually, Wilt gets arrested for accidentally assisting some burglars when they moved some furniture to their truck. The following morning, the Foster's gang checks out of a motel, and are about to give up on their mission and just hope that Wilt decides to come back in the near future. While going in the bus, they spot the same three criminals trying to hot-wire the bus. After finding out that Wilt is in jail, the group head over there only to find out that Wilt was freed from mowing all of the lawns in a nearby suburban area. At this point, they group assumes that Wilt must be after his original creator, and Mac then discovers that Wilt's owner is in Japan. Meanwhile, Wilt finally arrives at the basketball court he and his creator used to play at. There, he is greeted by an imaginary friend from his past: a basketball scoreboard friend named Stats. Wilt reveals that he is back for a rematch against Foul Larry, and that his deformities originated from him losing the game to save his owner. Despite this, Wilt loses the match again. As Wilt lies down on the ground in defeat, he is greeted by not originally his friends, but also his own creator, Jordan Michaels (a parody of Michael Jordan). Jordan explains to Wilt that he was never upset with Wilt, but only with himself. He stated that he looked for him everywhere after that game 30 years ago but was unable to find him, and explained how he not only made him a better basketball player, but made him a better person. In return, Jordan offers Wilt fame and a place to stay in his mansion. However, Wilt decides to stay back at Foster's so he could someday be adopted by another kid, and the film ends with Wilt and Jordan playing a lopsided game of one-on- one basketball at Foster's. During the credits, Wilt, Bloo, Mac, Eduardo, Coco, Frankie, and Mr. Herriman, are watching Jordan playing basketball during one of his professional games, with Wilt getting a little crazy on the commentary as the film ends.

One of Sonoma County's original five AVAs, Knights Valley AVA was formally designated an American Viticultural Area on October 21, 1983. Knights Valley AVA includes approximately . Over 30 growers maintain the planted to wine grape vineyards. The easternmost designated Sonoma County wine region, Knights Valley AVA has the warmest climate in the county. The valley lies between the Alexander Valley AVA and Chalk Hill AVA wine regions to the west and the Mayacamas Mountains to the east. Geographically, the appellation separates the rest of Sonoma County from the Napa Valley AVA.  History  Very few people inhabited the valley in 1843 when a land grant was given to Jose de los Santos Berryessa as a reward from the Mexican Governor for his years of good service. Most of Knights Valley (known as Mallacomes Valley) and Calistoga (Known as Agua Caliente) was within this grant. Knights Valley became Berryessa's private hunting preserve where he built an adobe hunting lodge that remains to this day. In 1850, after the Mexican War, California became part of the United States and most of the Spanish settlers including Berryessa returned to Mexico. Thomas B. Knight, a participant in the Bear Flag Revolt at Sonoma bought a large portion of Rancho Mallacomes from Berryessa and received title to the land in 1853. He called his rancho, Muristood, added a second story to the lodge and planted vineyards, peaches, apples and wheat. Mallocomes Valley would later be renamed \\"Knights Valley\\" after Thomas Knight.  Climate  Protected from direct Pacific Ocean influence, the valley is the warmest of Sonoma County's viticulture areas. Warm afternoons and cool evenings provide the ideal environment for growing Bordeaux grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon remains the star in the valley. Also present are the rest of the Meritage blend: Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot, as well as Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier, Syrah, and some limited plantings of other varietals.  Wineries  Several wineries produce wine with the Knights Valley AVA designation. The three largest producers of Knights Valley AVA designated wines are Beringer Vineyards, Kendall Jackson Winery (under its Highland Estates label), and Bavarian Lion Vineyards.

The character also appeared in the 2004 live-action film adaptation, Thunderbirds. Thunderbirds (1965-1966) Background The face of the Alan Tracy puppet was modelled on actor Robert Reed.Thunderbirds characters Matt Zimmerman voiced the character for all but one of his 1960s appearances; since Zimmerman was a late addition to the cast, Ray Barrett provided Alan's voice for his debut appearance in the series opener, \\"Trapped in the Sky\\". Zimmerman was recommended to producers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson by David Holliday, the voice of Virgil Tracy. In an interview, Zimmerman remembered of his casting: \\"They were having great difficulty in casting the part of Alan Tracy as they wanted a certain sound for him ...As I walked in [Sylvia Anderson] looked at me and said, 'Don't talk! Oh, my god, you've got those big eyes and the cleft in the chin and the cheek bones, and if you were blond you'd look very much like Alan.' She said, 'Now, sit down. What's you're [sic] name again?' And I said, 'My name is Matt Zimmerman and I'm from Detroit, Michigan,' and she said, 'That's the voice!' And that's how I got the job.\\" Character biography The fifth and youngest son of Jeff Tracy (the founder and financier of International Rescue), Alan is named after American astronaut Alan Shepard. Sources differ on the subject of Alan's age and date of birth; in the Thunderbird Fact File, his birthday is stated to be 12 March 2005 or 2044, making him 21 years old during the events of most of the series (he turns 22 in the episode \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\"). An accomplished sportsman and former racing driver, he can at times be bad-tempered and reckless.Peel 1993, p. 154. Alan studied at Colorado University, where his natural impetuousness led to a clash with authorities over the launch (and subsequent crash) of an unsanctioned, self-built rocket. His father took charge of the situation, steering the interest toward more constructive ends, ultimately resulting in Alan's role as astronaut and principal pilot of Thunderbird 3. The episode \\"Move ~ And You're Dead\\" reveals that Alan is additionally a skilled racing car driver, but that he gave up this career to assume his responsibilities within International Rescue. In \\"Atlantic Inferno\\", Alan pilots Thunderbird 1, assuming his brother Scott's role of flying to the danger zone and co-ordinating the rescue operation. Alan comments on how different it is from operating Thunderbird 3, prompting Scott to remind him to \\"bring [Thunderbird 1] back in one piece\\". In the film Thunderbird 6, he shoots three hijackers, becoming one of only three members of IR (with Scott and Gordon) to kill an enemy. The most romantic of all the Tracy brothers, Alan is involved with Tin-Tin, the daughter of Kyrano, caretaker of Tracy Island. However, despite his passion for her, he is seen to be attracted to IR's London agent, Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, in the episode \\"The Perils of Penelope\\" and the film Thunderbirds Are Go. Reception Zimmerman has spoken warmly of Alan's conception and development, commenting that \\"Alan was the one character that showed emotion. He used to get upset if he couldn't go on a mission, he got jealous if Tin-Tin talked to another man, and he was a very real character.\\" Science-fiction writer John Peel considers Alan evidence of the series' aptitude for strong characterisation, summing up his character as \\"love-struck and annoying\\", yet simultaneously \\"so human\\".Peel 1993, p. 245. Martin Anderson of the entertainment website Den of Geek describes Alan in less enthusiastic terms; according to Anderson, the character \\"was unfortunately relegated to the role of designated driver\\" for the purposes of ferrying supplies from Tracy Island to John Tracy on board the Thunderbird 5 space station. Mark Radcliffe argues that the original series character is overshadowed by Scott and Virgil, who direct most of IR's rescue efforts: \\"Poor Alan, despite having a rocket with much cooler fins than [Thunderbird 1], would then be dispatched to sort of see that everything was going OK. Pretty demeaning work for a guy who's been to puppet Colorado University.\\" The seeming lack of logic on the part of Jeff Tracy in entrusting Thunderbird 3 (the largest mobile Thunderbird machine) to Alan (the youngest of his five sons) has also been questioned. Thunderbirds (2004 film) In the live-action Thunderbirds, Alan is again demonstrated to be attracted to Tin-Tin; he was portrayed by Brady Corbet. In this film, Alan is 14 years old. Reception Graeme Clark, in a negative review of the 2004 film for the website The Spinning Image, writes that Brady Corbet's Alan is the only Tracy brother to be given a distinct personality; by contrast, his siblings are \\"totally interchangeable\\". A retrospective on Den of Geek draws parallels between the new Alan and the protagonist of the Harry Potter novel and film series, alluding to a reversal of the story concept \\"of a boy at home thrust into an adventurous world\\". Thunderbirds Are Go! (2015-) Like previous series, Alan is still the pilot of Thunderbird 3. Similar to his 2004 counterpart, he is once again a teenager and is sometimes treated like a kid by his brothers. On some occasions, he, is joined on board Thunderbird 3 by Scott or Kayo (the series' counterpart of Tin-Tin). Alan's equipment includes an orbital conveyance platform which lets him get closer to things such as the Sat-Mine machine in episode 3 \\"Space Race\\". Alan's immaturity is shown by his near-constant need to play some sort of zombie apocalypse computer game (shown in the episode \\"Slingshot\\") in Thunderbird 3, and a constant addiction to sleep. However, he appears younger than Kayo and as such is not attracted to her, in fact he sees her more as a sister. It appears as though Scott may have some attraction to her. Over the course of the series he becomes more mature on missions and continue being help for his brothers and allies.

VNPA meets regularly with heads of government agencies and State Government ministers in order to promote and achieve various conservation goals. History The Victorian National Parks Association was formed in 1952 when Victoria had 13 national parks and lacked any legislation governing these parks. As of 2007, Victoria had 52 national parks (including 13 marine national parks), 30 state parks, three wilderness parks, and 11 marine sanctuaries protected under the National Parks Act. The expansion of the state's parks has led to VNPA encouraging the state government and other private entities to provide additional funding for the conservation of these important areas. Campaigns * The allocation of more lands for logging in the Murray River region, during which VNPA encouraged the government to reconsider its forestry policy (2008) amid concerns that the wetlands could be lost forever. * The desire to end cattle grazing in Alpine National Park in 2004, which was protested by a number of cattlemen who took their cause to the federal government in Canberra in 2005. This case has garnered national attention due to the desire to have the Australian Alps listed as a World Heritage site. * The banning of oil and gas exploration in all marine national parks in Victoria in 2004. * The campaign for the preservation of a united Point Nepean, although the traditional owners ultimately went for another group's plan.

The film is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic 1886 horror novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The story takes place in modern times and concerns a bumbling chemist who tampers with his great-grandfather's formula, accidentally transforming himself into a beautiful businesswoman who is hellbent on taking over his life. Plot Dr. Richard Jacks (Tim Daly) is a perfumer working at a major fragrance company. His projects have failed and the chief executive, Mrs. Unterveldt (Polly Bergen), is thinking of replacing him with a woman. After his great-grandfather dies, Richard attends the will reading. He receives nothing but notes from scientific experiments and discovers that his ancestor was Dr. Henry Jekyll. He then decides to add more estrogen to a mixture that Jekyll was working on in the hope that it will prove less dangerous. Monitoring his vital stats after ingesting the formula, Richard gives up and attends a job interview. Although everything appears normal at first, Richard's voice begins to crack, his fingernails grow long and the hairs on his arms recede into his skin. He then feels a strange sensation in his groin area and watches in horror as his manhood disappears. Then, his head hair grows long and he starts to develop breasts. Embarrassed, Richard flees back to the lab, where the final stages of the transformation into a woman take place. The new female alter-ego (Sean Young) names herself Helen Hyde and introduces herself as Richard's new assistant. She rewrites his reports, is kind to his secretary, flirts with his superiors, Yves Dubois (Harvey Fierstein) and Oliver Mintz (Stephen Tobolowsky) and rewards herself with a shopping spree. Later, Helen meets and befriends Richard's fiancée, Sarah (Lysette Anthony), and convinces her to move out of his apartment just so she can have it for herself. The next day, after several comments from colleagues, Richard realizes that Helen was real but is unable to access any of her memories. Nonetheless, he feels invigorated and invites Sarah to his place for a romantic meal. Everything appears to be going well until he realizes he is transforming into Helen again, causing Sarah to flee in confusion. Helen becomes resentful at having to share a body. She disfigures one of Richard's colleagues, Pete (Jeremy Piven), and steals his ideas. She even attempts to seduce Oliver. Just when they are about to have sex, she starts changing back into Richard and hides in the bathroom and escapes via a nearby window. Due to her flirting with Oliver, Helen is named Richard's superior at work. To stop her, Richard handcuffs himself to the bed, only to be horrified as Sarah walks in and finds his closet to be full of lingerie. This leads Sarah to believe that he and Helen are having an affair. Helen then has a private meeting with Dubois and Mintz presenting \\"Indulge\\", the perfume she stole from Richard. It is during this meeting that she fondles the crotches of both men with her hosed feet at the same time under the table, in order to persuade them. She then sleeps with Dubois shortly after he confronts her about her false resume. Helen then warns Richard via video of her intentions to take over completely. Richard realizes that he is actually starting to spend more time as Helen than himself. He tries to humiliate Helen in front of her superiors by stripping naked and writing obscenities all over his body, hoping that they will walk in after he turns into her. Helen manages to outsmart Richard by delaying the transformation, causing his plan to backfire and him to be fired. Sarah is finally convinced by seeing CCTV security footage from the initial transformation. Richard comes up with a formula that would effectively destroy the female part of himself, but he must consume it as Helen within a certain time frame. To avoid letting her escape, Richard handcuffs his hands and straps his feet to a bed. After he transforms, Sarah attempts to inject Helen with the formula but fails—injecting only about 20% of it, causing random body parts to spontaneously transform between male and female. A fire breaks out in the apartment and Helen manages to escape. At the launch of Indulge, the perfume she stole from Richard, Helen steals a guest's dress. As she mingles, the effects of the formula cause her to temporarily grow stubble; her breasts also disappear and reappear. Sarah, who sneaked into the party, hides in a podium and waits until the promotion video starts before injecting the rest of the formula into Helen, who changes back into Richard for good. Relieved, he realizes it's over but sees that he's now standing in a room full of colleagues wearing a dress. Richard makes a speech about how the only way he could understand a woman was to become one. He then is offered a promotion as well as a vacation, which he accepts. As he removes the undergarments, he comments \\"Helen and her damn thongs\\" before heading out with Sarah. Cast Reception The film received a 14% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was nominated for three Razzie Awards including Worst Actress for Sean Young, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Screen Couple for Daly and Young. It was also nominated for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy at the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. \\"At an age when she should be hitting her stride,\\" wrote film critic Mick LaSalle, \\"she is already parodying herself -- parodying her public image, of all things, not her screen image...It's just possible that schlock is Young's natural element and roles like this her true calling\\". Hugo Davenport in the Daily Telegraph said, \\"Apart from being a travesty of Stevenson, it is so crass, witless and misogynistic that it makes \\"Confessions of a Window Cleaner\\" look like Dostoevsky\\".Quoted at . A review from The Austin Chronicle summarized the film by saying, \\"Overall, this PG-13 bore is neither crass enough nor intelligent enough to hold anyone's attention.\\" Home media After its theatrical run, HBO Video released the film onto VHS and Laserdisc.

The constituency had been held by Maxton since the 1922 general election. Until 1931, he had contested the seat as a member of the Labour Party, and although the two parties had then split, Maxton had not had to contest his seat against a Labour candidate. Maxton also had a considerable personal vote as the most prominent member of the ILP. The ILP had been in a gradual decline since leaving the Labour Party, and the death of Maxton opened the potential of a rupture in the ILP, many members of which were keen to rejoin Labour. The ILP had only two other Members of Parliament, so it attached a high importance to holding the seat. The party eventually nominated their Scottish Organising Secretary James Carmichael, a member of Glasgow City Council, for the seat. Labour hoped to gain the seat and stood John Wheatley, a local lawyer who had served during World War II - in contrast, the ILP had opposed the war. The Unionist Party had little chance of taking the seat, a strongly working class area, but the possibility of a split left vote could perhaps improve their hopes. The Scottish National Party, with little background in the constituency, stood a candidate. Guy Aldred, a well- known local anarcho-communist standing on an abstentionist platform, completed the candidates. The Liberal Party were particularly weak in Glasgow, and opted not to contest the by-election. Results The ILP narrowly held the seat, but suffered a collapse in their majority. In this era of many two- and three- party by-elections, to win with only 34.3% of the votes cast was exceptional - the lowest winning percentage share since the 1930 Bromley by-election. Much of the ILP vote transferred to the Labour candidate, who came a close second. With the left vote split, the Unionists were able to place a strong third with 21.6%, while the Scottish National Party also picked up votes in fourth place, collecting 13.9%. Even Aldred was able to claim one of his best results, taking 2.2% and last position. The ILP victory only briefly delayed the party's decline. The following year, Carmichael followed the party's two other MPs into the Labour Party, and by the 1950 general election, the ILP was able to take only 5.8% of the vote in Bridgeton. Carmichael held the seat in his new party colours until his retirement in 1961, while Wheatley was elected in Edinburgh East the following year.

( 1175 – 6 March 1240), was born in Assisi in the second half of the 12th century. Biography He was a member of one of the noble families of the city, the son of Rosone di Monaldo, the brother of Favarone di Monaldo, who was the father of St. Clare of Assisi. He became one of the first followers of St. Francis of Assisi. The cave at the Eremo delle Carceri, near Assisi, where Friar Sylvester spent long periods in solitary prayer Sylvester was ordained a priest and became a canon of the Cathedral of San Rufino in Assisi. The story of his change of life is reported that, in 1209, he had initially sold some bricks to Francis, who, after his dramatic renunciation of his family, was on a campaign to repair the rural chapels around the city which had fallen into disrepair. He later saw Francis with Bernard of Quintavalle, a local nobleman determined to follow Francis and his way of life, who was in the middle of giving away his entire fortune to the poor. Falling prey to greed, Sylvester claimed that he had been paid too little for the bricks he had previously sold Francis and demanded a just compensation, which he was given. Sylvester later came to regret this spirit of greed he found in himself, and he too renounced his position and joined Francis, becoming the first priest in the primitive fraternity. He was known in the Order for his strict observance of the life of poverty and contemplation. Together with his cousin, Clare, he later prayed for enlightenment to discern the will of God for Francis. He often accompanied Francis during his preaching tours. Once, in the city of Arezzo, it was claimed by the residents that Sylvester's preaching and prayers brought peace to the city, which was falling prey to hatred and violence amongst its citizens. St. Bonaventure, in a special way, mentions the visions which Sylvester had concerning Francis. Sylvester died in Assisi in 1240. He is one of Francis' four original companions who are buried near his tomb in the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi. The cause for his canonization was opened by the Friars Minor and has been accepted by the Holy See for further study. References Sources *2 Cel 109; LegMaj III,5 *Fior 16 *Walsh, Michael.

The mascot is a Wildcat and its colors are Maroon and White. Warren County competes in VHSL activities in the Evergreen District, Region II, Group AA. Its main rivals are Skyline High School and John Handley High School. For 67 years it was located on Luray Avenue. A new WCHS (Fall 2007) is located on Westminster Drive, serving the eastern 40% of the county. Skyline High School opened in the Fall of 2007, serving the western 60% of the county. Early history: the 1910s, 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s In 1906 a high school department was added to Front Royal's first public school at 21-23 South Royal Avenue (c1870, still standing). In 1910 a new building for both the grade school and the Front Royal High School opened on Crescent St. (site of the current E. Wilson Morrison Elementary School). In 1918 the school board changed the name to Warren County High School, reflecting the consolidation of several county schools. County population growth, particularly accompanying the American Viscose rayon factory opening, necessitated a new high school building, occupied in 1940. The impressively sited, Classical Revival-style, Works Progress Administration-funded building was erected on Luray Avenue, and originally housed grades eight through twelve. The Crescent St. high school building burned in 1942 and the elementary school was expanded on the site thereafter. A sports rivalry with nearby John Handley High School in Winchester, became one-sided and diminished in the late 1960s as Handley focused more on nearby Frederick County (VA) rival James Wood High School.  Massive resistance: the 1950s  In the 1950s, the WCHS football team had several undefeated seasons. This success came to an end during the segregation/integration crisis of the late 1950s. Because WCHS was the only high school in the County (no \\"separate but equal\\" black high school), and local authorities were not ready to comply with U.S. Supreme court-ordered integration, WCHS was ordered closed by the Governor in the fall of 1958, as part of Virginia's \\"massive resistance\\" to implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education. (See also Virginia governor Lindsay Almond and the Stanley Plan). Although the high school building was closed, education continued in donated private and church spaces. Many seniors transferred to neighboring Rappahannock County (where an even smaller black population was not as politically active and the integration issue was not forced). Local Warren County 1959 graduation was held at the Park movie theater on Main St. There is no official WCHS Class of '59. Massive Resistance and Virginia's segregationist school efforts were given up by the end of the 1958-59 school year. The Luray Avenue building re-opened in the fall of 1959 with a significantly reduced white student population and 22 black students. Also in the fall of 1959 (after a hurried construction process) John S. Mosby Academy (grades 1-12), one of Virginia's several segregation academies opened, as well as public Criser High School, serving the black high school student population of Warren and Rappahannock counties (Criser was an effort to provide \\"separate but equal\\", segregated facilities). By the mid-1960s there were enough (black and white) students at WCHS to again field viable athletic teams. Black students continued to have a choice in high schools until Criser closed in 1966 due to declining enrollment. The Criser building was Warren County's middle school in the late 1960s and is now Ressie Jeffries Elementary School. (Note: There had always been a public elementary school for Warren County's small (less than 10%) black population, but high school-aged students attended classes in neighboring counties with black-only facilities.) Due to declining enrollment and financial challenges, Mosby closed at the end of the 1968-69 school year. Warren County Public Schools acquired the facility and to relieve crowding, it was used as the Junior High (grades 7-9) until 1988 (the Luray Avenue building had only grades 10-12 during this time), became a Middle School (grades 6-8) for another ten years, and closed as a school building at the end of the 2009-10 school year. After integration: the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s The 1960s also saw the last success of Warren County football for over 35 years. A promising start during the integrated era (four winning seasons in 1965-66-67-69) sputtered, with a 6-4 season in 1973WCHS Mirror,1974 the last winning season until the 2003 campaign. The 1960s also saw several Wildcats win state titles in forensics. Overcrowding was alleviated again in the late 1970s, with the construction of the Fine Arts wing (which included a new gymnasium and new library in the old gym) and the Vocational Technology (also known as the \\"Vo-Tech\\") building. WCHS sports teams never played varsity field contests at the Luray Avenue site. The baseball team played at Front Royal's Bing Crosby Stadium and the football team played there through the early 1970s when contests were moved to the Mosby facility which included a football field (under control of the school system, not the municipality). Warren County's basketball teams began to achieve some success in the late 1970s under long- time head coach Jim Moose. While other powers such as R.E. Lee-Staunton were dominant during this era, Moose's Warren County teams provided Lee and other Region II powers with good competition. Warren County advanced to the state quarterfinals three times during the 1980s and 1990s but never advanced past the semifinals. Softball teams under Bob Mason won two state titles in 1983 and 1984. The arrival of Charlie Dodge and Roger Seemiller created a strong wrestling program that has improved the entire Northwestern District in the past 10 years, winning several district titles and even a region title. A growing population to serve: the 1990s and today The overcrowded high school became a political issue during the late 1980s as Warren County's population grew. A movement grew to build a new and larger high school, but a bond issue to build such a school was defeated in 1991. The opposition was based around not only the cost of the new school but also a fear of the school being so large that it would be forced to compete in VHSL Group AAA activities. This was not solely an issue of wanting Warren County to do well: nearby James Wood High School had been forced into Group AAA during the 1980s and was forced to travel two or more hours simply to play required district matches. This was in addition to the concern over students \\"being lost\\" in a school that was too big. Eventually, the pressure of numbers, especially in the lower grades, became a detriment to/violation of educational specifications. A realignment saw the Luray Avenue building with freshmen in the Fall of 1988, the first time since the 1968-69 school year. This arrangement continued for several years. An additional elementary school was built for the eastern part of the county in the mid-1990s, and an adjacent facility for grades 8 and 9 was built a few years later, allowing the high school once again to be just for grades 10-12. A new school A revival of the football program also occurred starting in 2003, with new coach Heath Gilbert leading the Wildcats to three straight 6-4 seasons with the single wing offense, and running back H.B. Banjoman breaking the VHSL's 10-game rushing record in 2005. (Gilbert later was selected to be the first head coach at the new Skyline High School.) By 2004, the writing was on the wall. Warren County was one of the largest schools in Group AA (with over 1,650 students) and the facility simply could not handle the additional numbers that were coming in due to Warren County's growth as an outer suburb of Washington, DC. The Warren County School Board approved an ambitious capital improvement plan that would see Warren County's high school population split. The newer 8-9 facility off Westminster Drive in the eastern part of the county was expanded into a full-featured high school (and assumed the Warren County High School name, colors, mascot, and records) and a completely new high school facility was built for the western part of the County on Rt. 340 South (and by the community, the suggestion was named Skyline High School, with green/blue/gold colors and a hawk mascot). Each school served grades 8-12, contained a full complement of athletic fields, and opened in the Fall of 2007. (An alternate plan would have named the schools \\"East Warren County High School\\" and \\"West Warren County High School.\\") Warren County High School is one of the smallest high schools in Group AA. Enrollment at Warren is lower than at Skyline. Since Warren serves the eastern end of the county that is closer to Washington, DC, it was hoped that population and enrollment would increase faster at Warren than at Skyline to make up the difference. The 2008-09 economic recession slowed such predicted growth. Students at WCHS (and Skyline) are also eligible to apply to Mountain Vista Governor's School to take advanced math, science, humanities, and research courses. In the Fall of 2010, the Luray Avenue building re-opened as Warren County Middle School after an extensive, three-year, remodeling to accommodate all of the County's sixth and seventh graders (approx 825 in the 2011-12 school year). Significant tax credits made feasible the restoration of much of the 1940 portion of the facility to its original \\"grandeur\\", including extensive woodwork preservation and slate chalkboard restoration. On November 19, 2011, the WCHS theater troupe (Maroon Masque), competed in the VHSL Region II Theater Festival at Tuscarora High School and placed first with the play ‘The Greek Mythology Olympiaganza! (Iliad! Iliad! Iliad!)’ By Don Zolidis. The second decade of 2000 has brought a resurgence to the Warren County High School athletic programs. Led by Tony Tallent, the football team won a district title in 2012, followed by several successful seasons with winning records. Girls Basketball, under head coach John Kelly, won the season and district title in the Evergreen District in 2013, the first since 1976 and have won more games in 8 years than the previous 25 years combined. Wrestling has become a dominant program under coach Matt Wadas and recently had a two- time state champion in Zach Beckner (2015, 2016). In 2013 the County approved design for construction of a second middle school, in the eastern part of the County, near WCHS. This facility opened in August 2017 as Warren County Middle School. The historic Luray Avenue building is now designated Skyline Middle School. This arrangement allows the County to divide the WCHS and Skyline student populations in the sixth grade and relieve anticipated crowding at the high schools by returning the County's 8th graders to middle school facilities.

He served as the head football coach at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania (1981), Rice University (1989–1993), Duke University (1994–1998), and Lenoir–Rhyne University (2007–2010), compiling a career record of 59–104–1. Coaching career Goldsmith is perhaps best known for his head coaching stints at two NCAA Division I football programs: Rice and Duke. He was recognized as the 1992 Sports Illustrated National NCAA Football Coach of the Year for leading Rice to within one win of a bowl game. Primarily on the strength of turning the Rice program around, he was hired at Duke in 1994, where he won the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award in his first season after leading the Blue Devils to their first winning season in six years. However, this momentum did not last, and within two years the Blue Devils had crumbled to a winless season in 1996, only the second in school history. Goldsmith was relieved of his duties by Duke athletics director Joe Alleva just a year into Alleva's tenure after recording only six wins during his last three seasons. In addition, under Goldsmith's tenure, Duke's football program was ordered to pay walk-on kicker, Heather Sue Mercer, $2,000,001 in nominal and punitive damages for its discriminatory treatment of her during her time on the team. A federal jury found that Mercer was afforded less of an opportunity to practice and compete than other 'similarly situated' players (other walk-on kickers). Her allegations also included sexist statements made to her by Goldsmith. (See Mercer v. Duke University, 190 F.3d 643 (4th Cir. 1999). Goldsmith's final coaching job was as the 18th head football coach for Lenoir–Rhyne University, an NCAA Division II school in Hickory, North Carolina. Hired on November 28, 2006, Goldsmith arrived at Lenoir-Rhyne fresh off a successful four-year run at Franklin High School in Franklin, North Carolina, where he compiled an overall win-loss record of 47–15.

History South Facade of Pavilion A, Albert B. Chandler Hospital The Kentucky General Assembly approved the construction of the University of Kentucky Medical Center and accompanying medical school in 1956. William R. Willard directed the planning and development of the University of Kentucky Medical Center and subsequently was appointed Vice President of the Medical Center and Dean of the College of Medicine. The Medical Sciences Building was completed in 1960, and four years later the College of Medicine graduated its first class of 32 students. Since then, 3,391 medical students have earned M.D. degrees from the institution. The current Dean is Robert DiPaola, M.D., overseeing 2,278 full-time and temporary staff members, 543 medical students, 261 graduate students, and 757 residents as of 2017. Curriculum The school offers a four-year M.D. program including two years of basic science instruction and two years of clinical rotations. In addition, the college supports combined degree programs that allow students to earn MBA, MPH, or Ph.D. degrees while pursuing the M.D. Classes are arranged around a loose block schedule, beginning and ending intermittently throughout the academic year. In the first two years, classes often adjourn by noon, leaving students free to pursue independent study or extra-curricular activities. Since the early 1990s, the college has been part of a model program to integrate early clinical experiences in among the traditional science classes of the first two years. Students are active in the community, running the UKSA clinic affiliated with the Salvation Army, organizing an annual Community Health Fair, undertaking rural medicine externships in surrounding counties, and volunteering independently.  Regional Campuses  The University of Kentucky has also partnered with regional hospitals and schools to create satellite campuses and a Rural Physician Leadership Program (RPLP) to help address the shortage of community-based physicians in the state of Kentucky.Rosenblatt RA, Andrilla HA, Curtin T, Hart G.

JAMA. 2006;295(9):1042-1049. doi: 10.1001/jama.295.9.1042 The University of Kentucky RPLP was developed in partnership with St. Claire Regional Medical Center and Morehead State University in Morehead, Kentucky. From its realization in 2008 to 2016, over 50 medical students have matriculated to the program to spend their third and fourth years of medical school being trained as rural physicians and leaders.Arnett PK, Stratton T, Weaver A, Elam C.

Journal of Regional Medical Campuses. 2018;1(3):1-5. doi: 10.24926/jrmc.v1i3.1262 In partnership with Western Kentucky University and The Medical Center in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the University of Kentucky College of Medicine - Bowling Green Campus began training its inaugural class of 30 medical students in July 2018. This campus now also offers an early assurance program for undergraduates meeting certain criteria to gain guaranteed admission to the doctoral program upon completion of their university's graduation requirements. In fall of 2019, the University of Kentucky expects to open another regional 4- year medical school campus in Northern Kentucky, as part of a partnership with St. Elizabeth Healthcare (Kentucky) and Northern Kentucky University. The inaugural class will be composed of 35 first-year medical students.

The ridge also is the site of a transmitting antenna farm that serves most of Knoxville's broadcasters.Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park History , City of Knoxville website, accessed August 30, 2009Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park, Tennessee Ornithological Society website, accessed August 30, 2009 The highest ground point on the ridge is an abandoned fire tower located at 1,391 feet (424 m) above mean sea level. The ridge itself averages 200 to 300 feet (40 to 60 m) above the surrounding valley floor, allowing panoramic views of the Great Smoky Mountains and adjacent ranges to the east and the Cumberland Plateau to the west. Sharp's Ridge is named for the Sharpe family, who lived on the ridge during the 19th century.Jim Matheny, \\"Why Do They Call It That? Sharp's Ridge.\\" WBIR.com, 3 December 2010. Geography Sharp's Ridge (spelled \\"Sharp Ridge\\" on United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographical maps) is a narrow, elongate ridge characteristic of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. The ridge stretches northeastward for approximately from Third Creek (near Knoxville's West Haven suburb) to Love Creek (at Mill Road, near the Oak Grove community). Beyond Love Creek, the ridge formation continues northeastward as McAnnally Ridge. The southern fringes of the Inskip and Fountain City suburbs, Christenberry Heights, and Beverly are located along the northern base of the ridge. The Lonsdale, Lincoln Park, and Whittle Springs neighborhoods of North Knoxville are located along the ridge's southern base. First Creek and Second Creek, both southward-flowing tributaries of the Tennessee River, carve water gaps through Sharp's Ridge, effectively splitting the ridge into three sections. The First Creek water gap is traversed by Broadway (part of U.S. Route 441), and the Second Creek water gap is traversed by I-275. Interstate 640 runs parallel to the northern base of the ridge. The ridge's middle section, between the First Creek and Second Creek gaps, is the highest and most prominent section, and is the location of Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park and the antenna farm. Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park North Knoxville viewed from Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park consists of along the ridge crest and southern face of the center of Sharp's Ridge. The park is accessible by Sharp's Ridge Road, just off Broadway.Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park , City of Knoxville website, accessed August 30, 2009 The park is home to a number bird species and is used by the Knoxville chapter of the Tennessee Ornithological Society for birdwatching activities. The park also has picnic facilities and several short walking trails. Visible from Sharp's Ridge on clear days to the south is an excellent panorama of the Great Smoky Mountains- State Line Ridge, then further northeast up the High Unaka Mountains (namely the Bald Mountains) with Camp Creek Bald in Greene County, Tennessee being the northernmost visible peak, to the Southern Unaka Mountains (namely the Unicoi Mountains) with Starr Mountain near Etowah, Tennessee the southernmost visible peak.Information verified by interpretive signs at Sharp's Ridge Memorial Park, 12 September 2009. These faraway peaks are verifiable through the location of Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) microwave dishes, which are aimed at relay towers on those faraway peaks. Most of the Tennessee side of the state line ridge is part of the Cherokee National Forest, the exception being the Great Smokies, which are part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. To the north of Sharp's Ridge on clear days is another excellent panorama, this one of the Cumberland Escarpment, the edge of the Cumberland Plateau that stretches from Sand Mountain in Alabama northeastward into Kentucky. Local peaks clearly visible from Sharp's Ridge include Hinch Mountain near Crossville to the Southwest, Frozen Head above Petros, Flag Pole Mountain (part of Cross Mountain) above Lake City, northward to Point Peak above Cumberland Gap. AT&T; microwave dishes aimed at those peaks verify their locations from Sharp's Ridge. Communications hub Former TV tower along Sharp's Ridge Road Sharp's Ridge is the transmitting antenna farm for eleven of Knoxville's twelve analog and digital television stations, all of which broadcast from very noticeable towers in an antenna farm along the ridge. The tower for WIMZ-FM, located on the north side of the ridge is tall, making it the tallest man made structure in Tennessee It was the tallest structure in the world when it was completed in 1963. The second tallest tower is inches shorter than the WIMZ-FM tower, and is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as \\"Spectracite Tower Knoxville,\\" built by Spectracite Towers, Inc. The structure is owned by American Tower, which leases it to WUOT-FM 91.9. PSIP Channel 6, whose \\"batwing\\" antenna is at the top (the station operates WATE-DT digital Channel 26 also on this tower). Also located on this tower is WTNZ PSIP Channel 43 and WBIR-DT, PSIP Channel 10, with their antennas both broadcasting from the top. This tower is located on the \\"Richland Towers Tower Lonsdale\\" site. The third tallest tower is FCC-licensed as \\"Richland Towers Tower Lonsdale.\\" It is tall, with a candelabra antenna platform at the top. It is owned by Richland Towers, Incorporated, which leases it to WVLT-TV PSIP Channel 8, (which operates WVLT-DT on digital Channel 30), and WKOP-TV PSIP Channel 15 (which operates its WKOP-DT digital Channel 17), whose antennas all broadcast from the candelabra array at the top. The \\"Lonsdale\\" reference in the license, refers to the Knoxville neighborhood in the valley just below the tower. The fourth tallest tower on Sharp's Ridge is and is FCC-licensed as \\"Gannett Pacific Tower Knoxville.\\" It is owned by the Gannett Pacific Corporation, licensee of WBIR-TV, which right now, does not broadcast from it. Its former analog Channel 10 antenna is on top of the tower, but its digital TV signal broadcasts from the \\"Spectracite Tower Knoxville\\" site. WBIR-TV transmitter building The fourth largest tower is somewhat shorter than its broadcasting counterparts at tall, and is FCC- licensed as \\"Young Broadcasting Tower Knoxville.\\" It is located within 50 feet of the \\"Spectracite Tower Knoxville,\\" virtually standing beside it. This tower with its identifiable \\"batwing\\" antenna at the top is the tower that WATE-TV, Channel 6 formerly broadcast its analog signal from. The fifth tallest tower, the \\"South Central Communications Tower Knoxville,\\" is , and is owned by South Central Communications, licensee of low power TV station WEZK-LP, Channel 28. On that tower is also the antenna for WKNX-TV PSIP, Channel 7. This is also the tower that WTVK-TV, Channel 26 formerly broadcast its analog signal from (that station is now WVLT-TV, PSIP Channel 8). WVLT-TV also broadcast from this tower for a time, after switching to VHF analog Channel 8. A much smaller self-supporting broadcasting tower is also located beside the \\"Gannett Pacific Tower Knoxville.\\" That is the tower that WBIR-TV formerly broadcast its analog signal from, also with a \\"batwing\\" array on its antenna at the top. At one time, this tower, another 800-foot (240 m) tower owned by WATE-TV, and the WTVK tower were the only ones on the ridge. The Sharp's Ridge antenna farm is also the transmitting location for Class C FM radio station, WJXB-FM 97.5, whose antenna is located on the South Central Communications tower.

Various other entities, including city, county, and state government agencies, and cellular telephone companies, also transmit base-to-mobile communications from towers on Sharp's Ridge far shorter than the ones listed above. \\"Antenna Farms\\" The Sharp's Ridge collection of broadcast towers, commonly referred to as an \\"antenna farm\\" is a good example of radio and TV stations, co-locating their broadcast towers near each other on the highest point near their FCC city of license. The nearest \\"antenna farms\\" to Sharp's Ridge are on Holston Mountain in upper East Tennessee, home to most of the FM and TV stations in the Tri-Cities (Bristol, Virginia- Kingsport, Tennessee-Johnson City, Tennessee) Designated Market Area (DMA), and the Signal Mountain broadcast antenna farm, near Chattanooga, Tennessee, home to most of the FM and TV station antennas in that DMA. Although most radio and TV stations are in fierce competition with each other in their broadcast markets, they will often locate their broadcasting antennas very near each other, and in some cases, will even share land or towers with each other, in the interests of space, land availability, and the cost of putting a transmission building on top of a mountain. Other examples of co-located towers on mountain peaks in the United States are on Poor Mountain near Roanoke, Virginia; Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama; Mount Wilson near Los Angeles; Sutro Tower in San Francisco; Lookout Mountain, Colorado near Denver; Cedar Hill between Dallas and Fort Worth; South Mountain Park near Phoenix; Nelson Peak near Salt Lake City; Sandia Crest near Albuquerque, New Mexico; and probably the most famous broadcast antenna farm of all: The World Trade Center Tower One, on which all of the New York City television and FM stations had their antennas. All were lost when Twin Towers One and Two collapsed after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Those antennas now broadcast from their old home, 200 feet lower, on the Empire State Building.

In graph theory, Hedetniemi's conjecture, formulated by Stephen T. Hedetniemi in 1966, concerns the connection between graph coloring and the tensor product of graphs. This conjecture states that : \\\\chi (G \\\\times H ) = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\chi (G) , \\\\chi (H)\\\\\\\\}. Here \\\\chi(G) denotes the chromatic number of an undirected finite graph G. The inequality χ(G × H) ≤ min {χ(G), χ(H)} is easy: if G is k-colored, one can k-color G × H by using the same coloring for each copy of G in the product; symmetrically if H is k-colored. Thus, Hedetniemi's conjecture amounts to the assertion that tensor products cannot be colored with an unexpectedly small number of colors. A counterexample to the conjecture was discovered by (see ), thus disproving the conjecture in general.  Known cases  Any graph with a nonempty set of edges requires at least two colors; if G and H are not 1-colorable, that is, they both contain an edge, then their product also contains an edge, and is hence not 1-colorable either. In particular, the conjecture is true when G or H is a bipartite graph, since then its chromatic number is either 1 or 2. Similarly, if two graphs G and H are not 2-colorable, that is, not bipartite, then both contain a cycle of odd length. Since the product of two odd cycle graphs contains an odd cycle, the product G × H is not 2-colorable either. In other words, if G × H is 2-colorable, then at least one of G and H must be 2-colorable as well. The next case has been proved long after the conjecture's statement, by : if the product G × H is 3-colorable, then one of G or H must also be 3-colorable. In particular, the conjecture is true whenever G or H is 4-colorable (since then the inequality χ(G × H) ≤ min {χ(G), χ(H)} can only be strict when G × H is 3-colorable). In the remaining cases, both graphs in the tensor product are at least 5-chromatic and progress has only been made for very restricted situations.  Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture  The following function (known as the Poljak-Rödl function) measures how low the chromatic number of products of n-chromatic graphs can be. : f(n) = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{ \\\\chi (G \\\\times H) \\\\colon \\\\chi (G) = \\\\chi (H) = n \\\\\\\\} Hedetniemi's conjecture is then equivalent to saying that . The Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture instead states merely that the function f(n) is unbounded. In other words, if the tensor product of two graphs can be colored with few colors, this should imply some bound on the chromatic number of one of the factors. The main result of , independently improved by Poljak, James H. Schmerl, and Zhu, states that if the function f(n) is bounded, then it is bounded by at most 9. Thus a proof of Hedetniemi's conjecture for 10-chromatic graphs would already imply the Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture for all graphs.  Multiplicative graphs  The conjecture is studied in the more general context of graph homomorphisms, especially because of interesting relations to the category of graphs (with graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows). For any fixed graph K, one considers graphs G that admit a homomorphism to K, written G → K. These are also called K-colorable graphs. This generalizes the usual notion of graph coloring, since it follows from definitions that a k-coloring is the same as a Kk-coloring (a homomorphism into the complete graph on k vertices). A graph K is called multiplicative if for any graphs G, H, the fact that G × H → K holds implies that G → K or H → K holds. As with classical colorings, the reverse implication always holds: if G (or H, symmetrically) is K-colorable, then G × H is easily K-colored by using the same values independently of H. Hedetniemi's conjecture is then equivalent to the statement that each complete graph is multiplicative. The above known cases are equivalent to saying that K1, K2, and K3 are multiplicative. The case of K4 is widely open. On the other hand, the proof of has been generalized by to show that all cycle graphs are multiplicative. Later, proved more generally that all circular cliques Kn/k with n/k < 4 are multiplicative. In terms of the circular chromatic number χc, this means that if , then . has shown that square-free graphs are multiplicative. Examples of non- multiplicative graphs can be constructed from two graphs G and H that are not comparable in the homomorphism order (that is, neither G→H nor H→G holds). In this case, letting K=G×H, we trivially have G×H→K, but neither G nor H can admit a homomorphism into K, since composed with the projection K→H or K→G it would give a contradiction.  Exponential graph  Since the tensor product of graphs is the category-theoretic product in the category of graphs (with graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows), the conjecture can be rephrased in terms of the following construction on graphs K and G. The exponential graph is the graph with all functions as vertices (not only homomorphisms) and two functions f,g adjacent when :f(v) is adjacent to g(v') in K, for all adjacent vertices v,v ' of G. In particular, there is a loop at a function f (it is adjacent to itself) if and only if the function gives a homomorphism from G to K. Seen differently, there is an edge between f and g whenever the two functions define a homomorphism from G × K2 (the bipartite double cover of G) to K. The exponential graph is the exponential object in the category of graphs. This means homomorphisms from G × H to a graph K correspond to homomorphisms from H to KG. Moreover, there is a homomorphism given by . These properties allow to conclude that the multiplicativity of K is equivalent to the statement: : either G or KG is K-colorable, for every graph G. In other words, Hedetniemi's conjecture can be seen as a statement on exponential graphs: for every integer k, the graph KkG is either k-colorable, or it contains a loop (meaning G is k-colorable). One can also see the homomorphisms as the hardest instances of Hedetniemi's conjecture: if the product G × H was a counterexample, then G × KkG would also be a counterexample.  Generalizations  Generalized to directed graphs, the conjecture has simple counterexamples, as observed by . Here, the chromatic number of a directed graph is just the chromatic number of the underlying graph, but the tensor product has exactly half the number of edges (for directed edges g→g' in G and h→h' in H, the tensor product G × H has only one edge, from (g,h) to (g',h'), while the product of the underlying undirected graphs would have an edge between (g,h') and (g',h) as well). However, the Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture turns out to be equivalent in the directed and undirected settings . The problem cannot be generalized to infinite graphs: gave an example of two infinite graphs, each requiring an uncountable number of colors, such that their product can be colored with only countably many colors. proved that in the constructible universe, for every infinite cardinal \\\\kappa, there exist a pair of graphs of chromatic number greater than \\\\kappa, such that their product can still be colored with only countably many colors.  Related problems  A similar equality for the cartesian product of graphs was proven by and rediscovered several times afterwards. An exact formula is also known for the lexicographic product of graphs. introduced two stronger conjectures involving unique colorability.

History Srithammarat Suksa School was the first private school in Nakhon Si Thammarat. The school was built in 1901 by a group of U.S. Presbyterian missionaries who came to Nakhon Si Thammarat to teach Christianity. Their leader was Mr. Ekkles. In the early days, the school was called \\"The American School\\" and only boys were able to attend the classes. In 1941, during the alliance with Japan, the name of the school was changed from \\"The American School for Boys\\" to Sithammaratwittaya School. The school has grown into a co-educational institution of more than 5,000 students from kindergarten to grade 12. English programme The Srithammarat Suksa School English Programme (EP) was started in 2000 and is one of the largest English programs in southern Thailand with students from pre-kindergarten to grade 12. More than 800 students study most of their subjects in English under a faculty of 40 plus native English speaking teachers from a variety of Western countries. The English Programme is separated into three parts: * Kindergarten English Programme: KEP * Primary English Programme: PEP * Secondary English Programme: SEP KEP, PEP, and SEP operate classes of no more than 30 students, with several sections for each grade. All classes are taught in teams, with a Thai homeroom teacher or teachers’ assistant working with the native English speaking teacher. There is also an EIP (English Immersion Program) where students from the regular program are taught English by native English speaking teachers. There are 1,000 English books in the EP library plus a teacher's resource room of books from around the globe. The EP uses curriculum and standards from North America, Singapore, Australia, England, and Thailand. The EP foreign staff number about 45 from the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The English Programme purchased and built a new EP campus in 2011.

It originally opened in 1906 and closed in 1921. The Black Cat re-opened in 1933 and operated for another 30 years. During its second run of operation, it was a hangout for Beats and bohemians but over time began attracting more and more of a gay clientele, and becoming a flashpoint for what was then known as the homophile movement, a precursor to the gay liberation movement that gained momentum in the 1960s. The Black Cat was at the center of a legal fight that was one of the earliest court cases to establish legal protections for gay people in the United States. Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964. Origin The Black Cat opened in 1906, shortly after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the basement of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he turned it into a showplace for vaudeville- style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.Boyd p. 56Gary Kamiya, \\"Boisterous Dive's Saga Is the Story of SF's Seamier Side\\", San Francisco Chronicle (October 31, 2014) Beats and bohemians With the repeal of Prohibition, the Black Cat re-opened in 1933 at 710 Montgomery Street, again under Ridley's proprietorship. Sol Stoumen bought the bar in the 1940s.Boyd p. 57 In the early years of Stoumen's ownership, the Black Cat was a center for the bohemian and Beat crowd. William Saroyan and John Steinbeck were known to frequent the establishment, and part of Jack Kerouac's seminal Beat novel On the Road is set in the bar.Miller p. 346 Growing gay clientele While the Beats continued to congregate at the Black Cat into the 1950s, in the years following World War II, more and more gay people began patronizing it. The varied crowds mixed and gay Beat poet Allen Ginsberg described the Black Cat as \\"the best gay bar in America. It was totally open, bohemian, San Francisco...and everybody went there, heterosexual and homosexual....All the gay screaming queens would come, the heterosexual gray flannel suit types, longshoremen. All the poets went there.\\"D'Emilio p. 187 By 1951, the bar was placed on the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board's list of establishments which military personnel were forbidden to enter. The bar featured live entertainers, the best known of whom was José Sarria. Sarria, who began as a waiter, wore drag and entertained the crowd by singing parodies of popular torch songs. Eventually he performed three to four shows a night, along with a regular Sunday afternoon show, with Sarria performing full arias. His specialty was a re-working of Bizet's opera Carmen, set in modern-day San Francisco. Sarria as Carmen would prowl through popular cruising area Union Square. The audience cheered \\"Carmen\\" on as she dodged the vice squad and made her escape. The interior of the bar. Tables were pushed together to form a makeshift stage for live entertainment. Image courtesy of the San Francisco History Center, San Francisco Public Library Sarria encouraged patrons to be as open and honest as possible, exhorting the clientele, \\"There's nothing wrong with being gay–the crime is getting caught,\\" and \\"United we stand, divided they catch us one by one.\\"Shilts p. 52 At closing time, he would lead patrons in singing \\"God Save Us Nelly Queens\\" to the tune of \\"God Save the Queen\\". Sometimes he would take the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film Word is Out (1977), gay journalist George Mendenhall said: > \\"It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression > coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere > to turn...and to be able to put your arms around other gay men and to be > able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'...we were really not > saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' We were saying 'We have our rights, > too.'\\" Sarria became the first openly gay candidate in the United States to run for public office, running in 1961 for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.Miller p. 347 Sarria almost won by default. On the last day for candidates to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have assured Sarria a seat. By the end of the day, 34 candidates had filed.Witt, et al. p. 8 Sarria garnered some 6,000 votes, shocking political pundits and setting in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics.Shilts pp. 56-7 As Sarria put it, \\"From that day on, nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community.\\"Lockhart p. 36 Police harassment In 1948, the San Francisco Police Department and the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, in response to the Black Cat's increasing homosexual clientele, began a campaign of harassment against the bar and its patrons. Bar owner Stoumen was charged with such crimes as \\"keeping a disorderly house\\" and the State Board of Equalization suspended the bar's liquor license indefinitely. In response and on principle, Stoumen, who was heterosexual, took the state to court. In 1951, the California Supreme Court, in Stoumen v. Reilly (37 Cal.2d 713)Stoumen v. Reilly, 37 Cal. 2d 713) ruled that \\"[i]n order to establish 'good cause' for suspension of plaintiff's license, something more must be shown than that many of his patrons were homosexuals and that they used his restaurant and bar as a meeting place.\\" This was one of the earliest legal affirmations of the rights of gay people in the United States. The court qualified its opinion, however, by stating that ABC might still close gay bars with \\"proof of the commission of illegal or immoral acts on the premises.\\"Eskridge p. 94 In response to this legal victory and based on the \\"illegal or immoral acts\\" language of the opinion, the state passed a constitutional amendment creating the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC). The California State Assembly in 1955 passed a law authorizing broad powers for the ABC to shut down any \\"resort [for] sexual perverts.\\" The Black Cat was shut down under this authority, along with a number of other establishments. In a test case involving an Oakland bar, Vallerga v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the California Supreme Court struck down this new law as unconstitutional. This decision was not a complete victory, as the court noted that had the ABC's revocation been based on \\"reports of women dancing with other women and women kissing other women\\" it might have upheld the law. Homosexuals, therefore, had won the right to assemble but only if they agreed not to touch. Police and city officials responded to the increasing visibility of the Black Cat and other gay bars in the city, and the Black Cat's success in court, by increasingly cracking down, staging more frequent raids and mass arrests. One favorite tactic was to arrest drag queens, since impersonating a member of the opposite sex was, at the time, a crime. Sarria responded by passing out labels for the drag queens to wear reading \\"I am a boy\\" so it could not be claimed they were impersonating women.Shilts p. 53 Closure By 1963, following some 15 years of unrelenting pressure from the police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.Gorman p. 150 The site is now the location of Nico's, a high-end restaurant. On December 15, 2007, a plaque commemorating the Black Cat and its place in San Francisco history was placed at the site. Notes References * Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2003).

The company is a global provider of auto finance, with operations in the United States, Latin America, Canada, Europe (which was sold to PSA Groupe and BNP Paribas following the sale of GM's core area businesses Opel and Vauxhall in a $2.2 billion deal.) , and China. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, where it is one of the city's largest employers. Founded in 1992 as AmeriCredit Corp., the company was acquired by GM in October 2010 and renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc. The company provides retail loan and lease programs through auto dealers for customers across the credit spectrum. They also offer commercial lending products, such as retail floorplan, construction and real estate loans, or insurance for car dealerships. Before its acquisition by GM, the company ranked at 768 on the Fortune 1000. Acquisition by General Motors In July 2010, General Motors entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AmeriCredit in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.5 billion. The deal provided GM with a new financial arm to replace the loss of GMAC (now Ally Financial) in 2006. Following the approval of the deal by AmeriCredit shareholders, GM renamed the company \\"GM Financial\\" on October 1, 2010. On September 4, 2014, GM and GM Financial announced it entered into a support agreement providing for leverage limits and liquidity support to GM Financial if needed, as well as other general terms of support. Under the terms of the agreement, as GM Financial expands its product portfolio and grows its business, GM committed to provide funding to GM Financial if its earning assets leverage ratio rises above pre-determined thresholds. GM extended an intercompany revolving credit facility to GM Financial to provide up to $1 billion of liquidity if needed. This facility, which is subordinate to GM Financial’s senior unsecured and secured debt, will replace an existing $600 million line of credit from GM. The agreement also provides that GM will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that GM Financial will continue to be designated as a subsidiary borrower on up to $4 billion of GM’s corporate revolving line of credit. Since being acquired by GM in 2010, GM Financial has significantly increased its share of GM’s business which now represents 75 percent of GM Financial’s consumer loan and lease originations. On September 25, 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services upgraded the credit ratings of both GM and GM Financial to investment grade with a stable outlook. The new GM corporate and GM Financial credit rating is BBB-. On June 18, 2015, Fitch Ratings upgraded the credit ratings of both GM and GM Financial with a stable outlook. The new GM corporate and GM Financial credit rating is BBB-. International operations In April 2011, GM Financial acquired FinanciaLinx, one of the largest independent leasing companies in Canada, to expand product offerings into Canada. FinanciaLinx operates as a subsidiary of GM Financial. In November 2012, GM Financial announced the acquisition of Ally Financial's international assets. The transaction includes operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also includes Ally’s 40-percent interest in its Chinese joint venture GMAC-SAIC Motor. The majority of those assets were closed in 2013, with the remaining portion, an equity interest in a joint venture in China, completed January 2, 2015. In March 2017, the European arm of GM Financial was sold to Groupe PSA and BNP Paribas following the sale of GM's core area businesses Opel and Vauxhall Motors in a $2.2 billion deal.

It was released on October 20, 1998, by Red House Records. The album marked Gorka's return to Red House, after five albums with Windham Hill/High Street Records. This was heralded as a homecoming-of-sorts as Red House had issued Gorka's debut, I Know in 1987. The album also marks several changes in the life of the artist himself. Themes of parenting and family life first heard here on songs such as, \\"When He Cries\\" and \\"Cypress Trees\\" have now become a regular feature of Gorka's subsequent albums. The album was well received by both reviewers and folk music radio DJs. The album debuted at number two on the Folk Music Radio Airplay Chart for October and held the number one position in November 1998.Top Albums of October 1998 and November 1998 compiled by Richard Gillmann from FolkDJ-L radio playlists.  Songs   \\"Heroes\\"  \\"Heroes\\" was actually written by Gorka sometime in the 1980s. Gorka's copy of the lyrics were stolen, however, and the song was forgotten until Gorka relearned it from Hugh Blumenfeld a decade later. Blumenfeld tells this story: > I learned 'Heroes' from John in Kerrville – I think it was 1987. He was > camped next to my wife Andrea and me in an enclave that had been dubbed > 'Little New York.' I forget when we first heard the song, whether it was > there or earlier in NYC, but it was at Andrea's request that I learned it. > The song was brand new and we both loved it as soon as we heard it, but > Andrea was the one who wanted to sing it. So, one bright midmorning when > things in the campgrounds are lazy and slow, John passed over his notebook > and I copied out the words. Soon afterwards, the notebook – along with his > guitar – was stolen from his car and never recovered. > Andrea and I sang it at home from time to time during the next ten years – > our own private little treasure. It never occurred to either of us to ask > John about it, until I opened for him at Godfreys in 1997. It was only then > I learned that the song had been lost in the notebook and that he'd > forgotten it long ago. So I was able to play it for him downstairs in the > dressing room before the gig and write him out a copy of his own > lyric.Blumenfeld post on \\"The Gypsy Life\\" April 28, 2001.

Early life Barnum was born in Kansas City, Missouri. Her mother had been a writer and her father had been a baritone with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Barnum attended a private girls' school, Notre Dame de Sion and the University of Kansas. She was raised in the historic Roanoke-Valentine Road District in Kansas City, Missouri. Her first professional art exhibit opened when she was 15 years old. At the age of 17 she studied with art Professor Vincent Campanella and noted Hungarian Artist, Frank Szasz. Books written One of Barnum's most famous books is Gumwrappers and Goggles, the story of Southwest Airlines' legal fight. In the story, TJ Luv, a small jet, is taken to court by two larger jets to keep him from their hangar, and then to try to stop him from flying at all. Taken to court, TJ Luv's right to fly is upheld after an impassioned plea from The Lawyer. While no company names are mentioned in the book, TJ Luv's colors are those of Southwest Airlines, and the two other jets are colored in Braniff and Continental's colors. The Lawyer is designed to resemble Southwest's CEO Herb Kelleher.

Biography Born as the eldest son of Johann, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Dorothea Maria of Anhalt, during his first years, Johann Ernst had a tutor and arms master, Matt of Johan. His father died on 18 July 1605, leaving the duchy under the governance of a regent. In 1608 he began his studies at the age of 14 at the University of Jena accompanied by his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Frederick. While at the university, his guardian appointed a companion and supervisor over the three princes, who later became Field Marshal Kaspar of Teutleben and the Preceptor Frederick Hortleder. In 1613-1614, Johann and his brothers, with his guardians, took a tour of France, Great Britain and the Netherlands as part of their studies. In 1615 Johann Ernst reached adulthood and took control of his duchy and the guardianship of his under-age younger brothers. On 24 August 1617 in the Schloss Hornstein (now Wilhelmsburg Castle), during his mother's funeral, Johann Ernst created The Fruitbearing Society (Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft), a German literary society. The young duke participated as an initial member. During his government, Johann Ernst promoted the reforms of Wolfgang Ratke in Köthen. He also supported the similar school reforms of Johannes Kromayer and Johann Weidner in Weimar, starting on 1618 in Jena and Weimar with the annulment of tax decrees. In 1620 Johann Ernst served under Frederick V, Elector Palatine, the famous Winter King. After his defeat in the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620, the duke refused to submit to the Emperor without conditions. As a punishment, he lost his estates and the guardianship of his brothers. Now fully against the Habsburgs, he fought in the Netherlands and performed duties as a ride master. Later, he took a commission as a Danish lieutenant general of the cavalry and fought in the Thirty Years' War in Westphalia and Lower Saxony. As such he participated in the conquest of the Schlesiens. Afterwards he went to fight for Count Ernst von Mansfeld for one of his estates in Hungary. There Johann Ernst died, at the age of 32 years, in the Hungarian location of Sankt Martin, as a result of war wounds.  References  * Ernst Wülcker: Johann Ernst (dänischer General).

In 1672 John Ernest divided his possessions with his younger brothers. He retained Weimar, his brother John George I received Eisenach, and his other brother, Bernhard, received Jena. Eventually, the partitioned lands, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach (1741) and Saxe-Jena (1690) were re-combined. Like his father, John Ernest was particularly interested in the arts (see Fruitbearing Society). He was also an avid hunter. Given his overriding interest in these pursuits, John Ernest entrusted the reigns of government to his chancellor. In Weimar on 14 August 1656, John Ernest married Christine Elisabeth, (23 June 1638 - 7 June 1679), a daughter of John Christian, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (26 April 1607 - 28 June 1653).hull.ac.uk They had five children:Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan #Anna Dorothea (b.

Life  He was the second son of Johann Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg. After the death of his father in 1683, he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Weimar with his older brother Wilhelm Ernst as co-ruler (Mitherr). Johann Ernst was an alcoholic; this, and his non-interest in the government, was taken advantage of by his brother, who became the only, autocratic, ruler of the duchy. However, until the time of his death, Johann Ernst served as co- duke, without any significant influence on the government. Johann Sebastian Bach and Weimar In the first half of 1703, Johann Sebastian Bach served as a court musician at Weimar. He was still in his teens and developing a reputation as an organist. Little is known of his precise role (he may have been taken on as a violinist rather than a keyboardist), but as a mere musician, he most likely was considered a servant. He left to take up a position as organist of a church at Arnstadt. Bach returned to Weimar in 1708, after Johann Ernst's death, as court organist. Bach worked with one of Johann Ernst's sons, also called Johann Ernst, who had a keen interest in music. The prince's interest in collecting music was sufficiently well known that in 1713, when one of Bach's pupils, P. D. Kräuter, was requesting leave of absence to study in Weimar, he mentioned the French and Italian music that the prince was expected to introduce there.Peter F. Williams (1980)The Organ Music of J.S. Bach I: BWV 525-598, 802-805 etc., Cambridge University Press pp.283-5 The prince also composed, and Bach wrote the Organ Concerto No.1 in G Major, BWV 592, and Concerto for Organ solo in C major, BWV 595, after a theme by the prince. Family In Zerbst on 11 October 1685 Johann Ernst married firstly Sophie Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst. They had five children: # Johann Wilhelm (b. Weimar, 4 June 1686 - d. Weimar, 14 October 1686). # Ernst August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (b. Weimar, 19 April 1688 - d. Eisenach, 19 January 1748), later inherited Eisenach and Jena. # Eleonore Christiane (b. Weimar, 15 April 1689 - d. Weimar, 7 February 1690). # Johanna Auguste (b. Weimar, 6 July 1690 - d. Weimar, 24 August 1691). # Johanna Charlotte (b. Weimar, 23 November 1693 - d. Weimar, 2 March 1751). In Kassel on 4 November 1694 and only two months after the death of his first wife, Johann Ernst married secondly Charlotte Dorothea Sophia of Hesse-Homburg. They had four children: # Karl Friedrich (b. Weimar, 31 October 1695 - d. Weimar, 30 March 1696). # Johann Ernst (b. Weimar, 25 December 1696 - d. Frankfurt, 1 August 1715), a composer who studied with Bach and of whose concertos Bach made transcriptions . # Marie Luise (b. Weimar, 18 December 1697 - d. Weimar, 29 December 1704). # Christiane Sophie (b. Weimar, 7 April 1700 - d. Weimar, 18 February 1701). After Johann Ernst's death, his successor and eldest son, Ernst August, was nominally given his father's power, but the real power was retained by his uncle, Wilhelm Ernst, until his death in 1728, when Ernst August became the sole reigning duke of Saxe-Weimar.

It is characterized by heavy use of the oud and other string instruments such as the violin, the occasional use of bagpipes, and the inclusion of percussion instruments such as the mirwas, tabl, and duff drums. Khaliji incorporates elements of African, Indian, and Iranian music overlaying indigenous Arabian genres such as Samri, Liwa, and Sawt. Kuwait pioneered the Khaliji genre into its modern form in the second half of the 20th century and soon became the focal point of the industry in a fashion similar to Cairo and Beirut in the case of Arabic pop music.

Also known as Brachet, the vine produces naturally low yields and light bodied wines that are delicately perfumed. Recent thought among ampelographers is that Braquet is not related to the more aromatic Italian wine grape of the Piedmont region known as Brachetto.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 101 Oxford University Press 2006 History The Provence region where Braquet has historically been grown, mostly in the Alpes-Maritimes department around the towns of Cannes, Grasse and Nice. Documents from 1783-1784 describe Braquet growing in the Provençal towns of Cannes, Grasse and Nice where it was said to be a good table grape and blending variety in the local wines. The exact origins of the name Braquet is unknown but Master of Wine Jancis Robinson speculates that it might be a local family name of one of the variety's original propagators.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 134, Allen Lane 2012 Viticulture Braquet is a mid-ripening variety that naturally produces low harvest yields of medium-sized berries even without severe pruning. The variety tends to thrive on poor vineyard soils and in hot and dry conditions. The grape's main viticultural hazard is a susceptibility to botrytis. Wine regions and AOC regulations In 2008 there were 30 acres (12 hectares) of Braquet planted in France, mostly around the town of Nice where the variety is known as Brachet. Here it is a permitted variety in the Bellet AOC where it is blended with Fuella Nera to make up at least 60% of the blend for the AOC red and rosé wines. Other varieties that can be blended with Braquet in Bellet include Grenache and Cinsault. Braquet grapes destined for AOC wine production in Bellet must be harvested to a yield no greater than 40 hectoliters/hectare with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of 10.5%P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 40 Firefly Books 2004 Styles Vineyard in the Bellet AOC near Nice where Braquet is still grown today. According to Jancis Robinson, Braquet tends to make a light bodied, slightly floral wine with very little color. While it is often used as a blending grape, its light pigment does lend itself well to rosé production which is what most varietal examples of Braquet tend to be. Relationship to other varieties Due to the similarities in name, Braquet was often confused with the Piedmont wine grape Brachetto noted for the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) Brachetto d'Acqui. However DNA testing has confirmed that they are separate varieties. The Provençal grape Calitor is another variety that Braquet shares some synonyms with and is often confused for. The white wine grape Braquet Blanc de Nice is a white color mutation of Braquet. Synonyms Over the years Braquet has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Brachet (in Nice), Bracke, Calito du Languedoc, Canseron and Pecoui Touar du Var.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Braquet Accessed: March 24th, 2013 References External links * Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Braquet"},{"id":"8155674","text":"The Victoria Medal is an award presented by the Royal Geographical Society.

At Canelli, on the border between the hills of Asti and the Langhe proper, the grape is known as Borgogna. The most notable wine here is the red Brachetto d'Acqui Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) which is made in both still and spumante (fully sparkling) versions. The Piemonte Brachetto Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC), also a red wine, is made with a minimum of 85% Brachetto; it is usually still, but may be frizzante (lightly sparkling). The grape is also used for up to 10% of the blend for the Ruché-based Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato DOC. J. Robinson. Vines, Grapes & Wines, p. 210, Mitchell Beazley, 1986. . Wines Brachetto tend to produce light-bodied, highly aromatic wines with distinctive notes of strawberries. In the DOCG region of Brachetto d'Acqui, the grape is used to produce a slightly sweet sparkling wine that is similar to Lambrusco and is sometimes called the a light red equivalent of Moscato d'Asti.

The bus stops primarily at existing MARTA bus stops. The company provides 100,000 rides monthly, with gross revenues of over $1 million annually.. It represents one of the first private mass transit companies to provide service solely within Atlanta. The bus service was founded in August 2001 by Carlos Ochoa. They founded the company to directly compete with MARTA by provide better bus service to the Hispanic immigrant population on Buford Highway. The bus fare is only $1.50, 50 cents cheaper than MARTAs fare. Additionally, all drivers speak both English and Spanish. The company also strives to provide more frequent service than the MARTA bus route. However, unlike other metro Atlanta public mass transit agencies, there are no free transfers available between the Royal Bus and MARTA. Over half of the buses are owned by their drivers who act as subcontractors to Ochoa. Although MARTA has stated that the existence of Royal Bus Lines is not a threat to its service to Buford Highway, there have been several instances of altercations between MARTA and Royal bus drivers and accidents between MARTA and Royal buses as they compete for the same bus stop. Both organizations have been found financially liable for causing accidents between each other's buses.. Ochoa has installed cameras on his buses to document improper behavior by MARTA buses; a newspaper article reported that Ochoa had video footage of a MARTA bus driver making obscene gestures and grabbing his groin. A more serious dispute occurred in April 2005 when a physical dispute occurred between drivers stopped at a red light--the MARTA driver alleged coins were thrown at him by the Royal bus driver, and the Royal bus driver said a soda bottle was thrown at him by the MARTA driver.

As of 2016 it was tied as the third ranked pharmacy school in the US.U.S. News & World Report U.S. News & World Report: University of Michigan--Ann Arbor Page accessed April 15, 2015  History  Pharmacy was first taught at the University of Michigan in 1868 within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. A School of Pharmacy, the nation's first school of pharmacy at a state university, was established on December 29, 1876, by Albert B. Prescott. As the first dean, Dr. Prescott introduced the concept of basic science education as a prerequisite to practical training for those pursuing a pharmacy degree. Phi Delta Chi (ΦΔΧ) was founded on 2 November 1883 at the College by 11 men, led by Dean Prescott. The fraternity was formed to advance the science of pharmacy and its allied interests, and to foster and promote a fraternal spirit among its brothers, now both male and female. In 1916 the school was renamed the College of Pharmacy. Today, the College is a member of the University of Michigan Health System, and is fully accredited by the American Council for Pharmacy Education.  Notable alumni  The sisters Amelia and Mary Upjohn, daughters of the founder of the Upjohn Company, graduated in pharmacy in June 1871, just three months after the first two women to receive degrees at the University of Michigan. Other notable graduates of the U-M College of Pharmacy include Josiah K. Lilly, grandson of the founder of the Eli Lilly Company; John G. Searle, grandson of the founder of G. D. Searle; Charles R. Walgreen, Jr., and Charles R. Walgreen III, son and grandson of the founder of the Walgreen chain of drugstores; Gregory Peck, Sr., father of the actor, and Tiffany Porter, track and field athlete.

Designed by architect Willis G. Hale and built between 1892 and 1894, the building originally functioned as apartments, housing some of Philadelphia's wealthy residents. Lorraine Apartments was one of the most luxurious and best preserved late 19th-century apartment houses in Philadelphia. In 1900 the building became the Lorraine Hotel when the Metropolitan Hotel Company purchased the apartments. Later it would become the first hotel in Philadelphia to be racially integrated under Father Divine. The hotel was abandoned and deteriorated, with graffiti all over the walls, broken windows, and crumbling stone. On September 16, 2015, a massive renovation project was begun. Early history Both the location of the building and the architecture itself reflect the changes that were occurring rapidly in the city of Philadelphia and in the country at the time. North Philadelphia of the 1880s attracted many of the city's nouveau-riche, those individuals who became wealthy as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The Lorraine was a place of luxurious living, providing apartments with new amenities such as electricity. In addition, the building boasted its own staff, eliminating the need for residents to have private servants. There was also a central kitchen from which meals were delivered to residents. The Lorraine Apartments were also an architectural feat. Prior to this period, the majority of Philadelphia's buildings were low rise, generally being no more than three or four stories tall. Not only were construction materials and techniques not capable of supporting taller buildings, but the inconvenience of the many flights of stairs to get to higher floors in the absence of an elevator was significant. The top-floor under Father Divine The Lorraine, at ten stories tall, was one of the first high-rise apartment buildings in the city. The building's architect, Willis G. Hale, also designed an earlier high-rise apartment building at 22nd and Chestnut Streets, which stood from 1889 until its demolition in 1945. Hale designed many other buildings around the city, but quickly fell out of favor at the turn of the century when most patrons rejected his highly stylized Victorian designs for the sleeker style of modern skyscrapers, and most of his landmarks had been torn down after the Great Depression. Father Divine and the International Peace Mission Movement The top-floor in 2010 In 1948, the building was sold to Father Divine (Reverend Major Jealous Divine) for $485,000. Father Divine was the leader of the International Peace Mission movement. After purchasing the building, Father Divine renamed it the Divine Lorraine Hotel. His hotel was the first of its class in Philadelphia, or indeed in the United States, to be fully racially integrated.According to the state historical marker The Divine Lorraine was open to all races and religions, men and women who were willing to follow the rules of the movement. Among others, the rules included no smoking, no drinking, no profanity, and no undue mixing of the sexes, with men and women residing on different floors of the building. Additionally, guests and residents were expected to uphold a certain level of modesty, meaning that women were expected to wear long skirts - pants were not allowed. Believing that all people were equal in the sight of God, Father Divine was involved in many social welfare activities as well. For example, after purchasing the hotel, several parts of it were transformed for public use. The 10th-floor auditorium was converted to a place of worship. The movement also opened the kitchen on the first floor as a public dining room where persons from the community were able to purchase and eat low-cost meals for 25 cents. The Divine Lorraine received a historical marker from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1994 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 as a site significant in terms of both architectural and civil rights history. Abandonment The building was closed in 1999 and sold in 2000 by the International Peace Mission. In May 2006 it was resold to Lorraine Hotel LP. to be converted into apartments. Development never came to fruition but furnishings were sold while floors, paneling, and other architectural items were removed by salvage companies. The building was reduced to a hollow shell, covered with graffiti, with windows boarded up or open to the weather. The Universal Peace Mission Movement still exists in the form of a network of independent churches, businesses, and religious orders. Its followers operated another hotel, the Divine Tracy in West Philadelphia, which they sold in 2006. It is now the Axis Apartments. Redevelopment In October 2012 the property was transferred to developer Eric Blumenfeld at the city's monthly Sheriff's sale, with Blumenfeld being the sole bidder. He gained control of the site in a two-step process: first, for an undisclosed price, he paid an outstanding note on the property from the New York-based Amalgamated Bank. Then he paid off city taxes and other liens. The value of both the mortgage and liens was $8,054,104.39. In February 2015 the developer announced renovation plans to convert the building into rental units with restaurants on the ground level pending closing on financing. As of May 2015 construction lighting was installed in the empty hotel and Procida Funding & Advisors agreed to lend $31.5M USD in construction funding. In August the Philadelphia Historical Commission approved the plans which will restore the building to its 1933 appearance. As of June 2016 a new rooftop \\"Divine Lorraine\\" sign had been installed and some interior apartments were nearing completion. In the fall of 2017 renovations have almost been completed by Domus Inc. (www.Domusinc.net) and EB Realty Management has already rented out 25 of the 77 available units in this historic building http://www.phillytrib.com/news/historic-divine-lorraine-hotel-turns-into- luxury-apartments/article_15a6aa7a-89c2-5d1a-aa07-560f76e84442.html References External links *Developer Official Site *Photoessay and history of the Divine Lorraine *Father Divine's International Peace Mission Movement *Philadelphia City Paper photo essay *Listing and photographs at the Historic American Buildings Survey *Photograph of the Divine Lorraine by James G.

It takes its name from one of the region's earliest Anglo settlers, John Elden, who, along with his family, established a homestead on the mountain's lower slopes and grazed sheep on the open grasslands below during the late 19th century. The mountain's exposed, rocky slopes are a dominant feature from almost any part of the city of Flagstaff, rising steeply nearly to an elevation of . Much of the vegetation on the southern and southeastern slopes of the mountain was destroyed by the human-caused Radio Fire in 1977 which burned . Despite its rugged appearance, steep relief, and nearly of surface area, Mount Elden is easily accessible via an extensive, well-developed road and non-motorized trail system that is part of the Coconino National Forest. Geology Mount Elden is one of five large peripheral silicic volcanic features within the greater San Francisco Peaks volcanic system (part of the San Francisco volcanic field) which include the nearby Dry Lake Hills, the Hochderffer and White Horse Hills to the northwest, and O'Leary Peak to the northeast. Because these features developed within close proximity of the San Francisco Mountain strato-volcano there is a strong likelihood that each is a geologic subsidiary of the larger mountain. Geologically, Mount Elden is a lava dome composed almost entirely of dacitic lava flows which emerged from several vents. These features emerged as intrusive emplacements within sedimentary blocks or as viscous extrusive flows in which the younger flows partially covered the older, lower flows. Geologic evidence suggests that the eruption of the mountain, which occurred at linear vents along regional faults, was a non-explosive event that took place during several flow sequences. Likewise, because of the high viscosity of the dacite, it is likely that the mountain formed in the short period of a few months' time. The mountain's overlapping flows commonly take lobe-like shapes which display a variety of flow characteristics and features including concentric benches, spires, ramping shear fractures, longitudinal tension fractures, and conjugate shear fractures. Positioned within the central part of Mount Elden, on the mountain's eastern and northwestern flanks, are two sedimentary blocks. Both of these blocks display characteristics of uplift that most likely occurred as dacitic magma intruded into the sedimentary strata at a shallow depth and uplifted the layers, causing them to dip away from the mountain. These blocks of sedimentary material are unique to the mountain, which otherwise is uniformly composed of silicic dacite.

Situated on the southern end of the Duchy, looks like a forward watchtower on the Castilian countryside. The Duchy of Cantabria () was a march created by the Visigoths in northern Spain to watch their border with the Cantabrians and Basques. Its precise extension is unclear in the different periods, but seems likely that it included Cantabria, parts of Northern Castile, La Rioja, and probably western areas of Biscay and Álava. The two main towns of Cantabria before its conquest by the Goths were Amaya (in northern Burgos) and the City of Cantabria, believed to have been near modern Logroño. Both towns were destroyed in 574 by Liuvigild, who massacred many of their inhabitants. The legend of this destruction remained for long in the memory of the affected peoples. Bishop Braulio of Zaragoza (631-651) wrote in his Life of St. Emilianus how the saint prophesied the destruction of Cantabria because of their alleged sins. It is held in popular belief that the converted refugees from the City of Cantabria founded the monastery of Our Lady of Codés in Navarre. A Senate of Cantabria mentioned in the Saint Aemilianus' work bears witness to a local nobility and a governing diet that may have been of the last independent Hispano-Roman provincial authorities. Some names are provided too, such as autochthonous Sicorius or Tuentius, with no clear ethnic affiliation, and Latin names Honorius and Nepotianus. In 581, right before major Frankish expeditions against the Basques and the establishment of the Duchy of Vasconia under Frank suzerainty, the count of Bordeaux Galactorius is cited by the poet Venantius Fortunatus as fighting both the Basques and the Cantabrians, while the Chronicle of Fredegar brings up a shadowy Francio duke of Cantabria ruling for a long period some time before Sisebut's successful campaigns against Basques and Cantabrians. Archaeological discoveries in the last decades around the millennium have brought to light that the cultural and economic influences, and even small groups of people in the near Basque territory once part of the duchy or limiting with it, came from way beyond the Pyrenees during this time gap of political vacuum or at the best, uncertain authority. In the late Visigothic period, at a second stage after the 6th century Cantabrian defeat, the Duchy of Cantabria is attested as being a buffer zone bearing witness to continuous fighting between Visigoths and Basques. In 670, the Visigothic king Wamba was campaigning there against the Basques when he heard of a rebellion in Septimania. Notice of a certain duke Peter of Cantabria, father of Alfonso I of Asturias, is attested on 9th century Asturian documents for the first years of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.

IMETS provides Army commanders at all echelons with an automated weather system to receive, process, and disseminate weather observations, forecasts, and weather and environmental effects decision aids to all Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS). IMETS is a mobile, tactical, automated weather data receiving, processing and dissemination system. The IMETS is an Army-furnished and maintained system operated by US Air Force battlefield weather team personnel. It uses US Air Force and Army developed software to provide a total weather system to support the Army. The Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA) software, originally developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in 1992, has been fielded on IMETS since 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. Army. IMETS is a heavy Humvee mounted tactical system which provides automation and communications support to staff weather teams assigned to echelons from brigade through Echelons Above Corps (EAC). IMETS receives weather information from polar-orbiting civilian and defense meteorological satellites, Air Force Global Weather Center, artillery meteorological teams, remote sensors and civilian forecast centers. IMETS processes and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce timely and accurate weather products tailored to the specific Warfighter's needs. IMETS provides automation and communications support to USAF Weather Teams assigned to Army G2/G3 sections at echelons Brigade through EAC. IMETS receives, processes, and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce weather forecasts and timely and accurate products to meet Commanders' requirements. IMETS produces displays and disseminates, over Army ABCS, weather forecasts and tactical decision aids that compare the impact of current, projected, or hypothesized weather conditions on friendly and enemy capabilities. Variations The IMETS currently fielded is in two configurations. They are the vehicle-mounted configuration (VMC), IMETS-Heavy, and the laptop version, the IMETS-Light. The IMETS-Light is the most common version; US Army uses IMETS-Light for aviation brigades and brigade combat teams. Both configurations have identical intelligence processing capabilities. The IMETS-Light has recently passed the Milestone C review and its production and fielding have official authorization. Both configurations of IMETS operate with ABCS Version 6.X-complaint software. Training IMETS training is accomplished at Staff Weather Officer (SWO) Course at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. SWO training is four weeks long, IMETS portion being half of that. This is somewhat ironic, as IMETS has not been used much since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began. Units with IMETS The following units use IMETS: * 1st Cavalry, Fort Hood, Texas * III Corps, Fort Hood, Texas * 101 Air Assault Division, Fort Campbell, Kentucky * 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia * 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, New York * I Corps, Fort Lewis, Washington * 25th Infantry Division, Fort Shafter, Hawaii * 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, Fort Bliss, Texas * 1st MEB, Fort Polk, Louisiana * 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, Fort Irwin, California * ARCENT, Fort McPherson, Georgia * 6th Infantry BDE, Fort Richardson, Alaska * 17th Aviation BDE, Yongsan, Republic of Korea * V Corps Aviation BDE, Frankfurt, Germany * 101st Aviation BDE, Fort Campbell, Kentucky * 2nd Infantry Division, Camp Red Cloud, Republic of Korea My Weather Impacts Decision Aid As of 2018, My Weather Impacts Decision Aid (MyWIDA), a decision-support software, was developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). Designed to improve compatibility of technology with environmental factors through weather forecasting, MyWIDA is an updated version of the Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), which the Army fielded in 1995. MyWIDA uses weather forecast data to evaluate environmental impacts on military technology, aiding decision-makers in selecting appropriate technological tools under forecasted weather events. An example is surface winds greater than 25 knots, which prohibit launching of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a military scenario. The user would be alerted of this physical limitation through the MyWIDA software. The system includes red- amber-green ratings (unfavorable-marginal-favorable), which account for a combination of weather parameters that affect a system or technology. These ratings determine limits beyond which it is not feasible for the technology function due to safety considerations, decreased system effectiveness or violation of manufacturer's operating limits. MyWida was preceded by Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), an automated software decision aid developed by ARL in 1992. IWEDA was fielded on the Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) in 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. IWEDA software was certified and accredited for the Army in 2006. As of 2011, the web-based MYWIDA was under development for eventual replacement of IWEDA. IWEDA was designed to address the adverse effects of the environment and climate (i.e. wind, precipitation, storms and temperature) on military operations and weapon systems. IWEDA produced a graphic display of weather impacts on 70 weapon systems, including 16 threat systems. Impacts were displayed graphically on a user interface, called the Weather Effects Matrix (WEM), which color coded the impacts on the system of interest (i.e. green “favorable,” amber “marginal,” and red “unfavorable”). Although intended for the Army, applications were also integrated into the Air Force and Navy systems. Over the years, observations have identified varying needs for IWEDA's improvement. These included (1) a need to derive complete mission impact due to poor weather conditions, rather than simply presenting a “worst- case scenario” for specific weapon systems; and (2) a need to improve representation of IWEDA's “stoplight” color scheme (green, yellow and red) by providing more color-coded values.

It was observed for the first time by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1674. Life cycle The rabbits ingest sporulated oocysts. Sporulated oocysts contain sporozoites that hatch and travel via the hepatic portal vein to the liver, and eventually penetrate the bile duct epithelium, where they undergo asexual reproduction known as schizogony. Rupture of the schizont consequently causes epithelial cell rupture and death. Merozoites will penetrate other cells and create more merozoites for one to several rounds. Eventually, a merozoite becomes a male microgamecyte and asexually reproduces in epithelial cells. A ruptured microgamecyte infects a cell with the female macrogamecyte and through sexual reproduction create a zygote. The zygote develops a protective shell before expulsion in the bile excreation and then the feces as an oocyst. Pathogenesis and Pathology The schizonts in the bile duct cause bile duct hyperplasia, and blockage of bile ducts leading to hepatomegaly and hence icterus. Due to liver failure, the abdomen will be distended with fluid. Diagnosis The presence of oocysts on fecal flotation or impression smear of the liver are diagnostic for coccidiosis. The prepatent period is 18 days; sporulation occurs after three days.

It broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 10,500 Watts. The station is run by a select number of students and is currently managed by Jesse Forkum and Sutherland Shrader. WFHU, 91.5 the Lion format is primarily contemporary rock, the \\"best of the 80s, 90s and now\\". Sunday mornings, called Gospel Sunday, has several religious programs as part of its form, ending with the live broadcast of the worship services of the Henderson Church of Christ, then going back to its regular format. WFHU also airs the Freed-Hardeman Lions and Lady Lions Basketball, Baseball, and softball games, along with Chester County High School football. The station also has daily programming run by the station staff. The station provides a live broadcast 24/7 on iHeart radio. History The idea of a radio station was started by members of the Board of Trustees of Freed-Hardeman College in 1965 to be the core of the new Communications Department being developed. John R. Hall was chosen the first General Manager and the funds for the station was partially supplied by the 'Freed-Hardeman Associates', a fund raising group associated with the college. The call letters WFHC was chosen. A student staff was collected by Mr. Hall and the initial station was built in the lower level of the Student Center. Although the staff worked to get the station operational in 1966 the first broadcast happened during 1967. In 1979 WFHC increased its power from 10 Watts to 3000 Watts. Also the station was moved from the student center to the Bible, Communications and World Evangelism Building, now known as the Gardner Center in 1982. In 2000 the power was increased to 10,500 watts. In 1991 WFHC hosted its 25th Anniversary by hosting an open house which allowed former members of the WFHC staff to take over the station. They were joined by senior members of the staff at the time. There was also a special dinner with members of the Board of Trustees and former General Manager John R. Hall as special guests. In 2006 WFHU celebrated its 40th anniversary. Due to the non- availability of the call sign \\"WFHU\\", which was assigned the United States Coast Guard, the call letters \\"WFHC\\" was not changed when Freed-Hardeman College went to University status in 1989. It was not until 2005 when General Manager Ron Means was able to get the call letters released by the Coast Guard, when the call letters officially changed to \\"\\"WFHU\\"\\". thumbnail The WFHU motto WFHU 91-FIVE (originally WFHC, 91-FIVE) was created by Ray Eaton, a former student staff member, former General Manager and former Director of Broadcasting for FHU. The unique logo, which had '91' with the call letters WFHC/U on top on the right side of the number, and the spelled out 'FIVE', with a line separating the call letters and FIVE, was created by student staff members David Florida and Jay Simmons in 1990. The motto was changed a few years ago by Ron Means from 91-FIVE to the current motto of FM91. In 2014, Freed-Hardeman laid off many staff members of the Communications department, and since then, students have had complete control of the radio station. The following year, the brand name for the station changed again from FM91 to 91.5 the Lion. Current programming Shows on WFHU include: The Rockshop, Gospel Sunday, Big Band Sounds, WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour, The Roadshow, and more. The Rock Shop: Starting at 7 pm CST The Rock Shop brings its listeners a wide variety of rock which fits in with the variety format of the station.

W. Marland, The 101 Ranch Oil Company was located on the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch and headquartered in Ponca City, Oklahoma. The company’s 1911 oil discovery in North Eastern Oklahoma opened up oil development in a great region from Eastern Oklahoma west to Mervine, Newkirk, Blackwell, Billings and Garber and led to the founding of the Marland Oil Company, later renamed the Continental Oil Company, now known as Conoco. Background Ernest Whitworth Marland was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on May 8, 1874. Marland studied to be an attorney, receiving an LL.B. from the University of Michigan Law School at the age of nineteen in 1893. Marland moved back to Pittsburgh and set up private practice. As an attorney representing local coal and oil interests of Pittsburgher James M. Guffey, the nation’s largest oil and gas producer and the principal investor in Beaumont Texas’ Spindletop discovery, Marland became interested in geology and by the age of 33, the young lawyer had become involved in a series of local coal and oil promotions which soon made him a small fortune. Unfortunately for Marland, the millions he had amassed were lost following the panic of 1907. By 1908, Marland was broke and without a job. Founding 250px Interested in reestablishing his oil ventures, Marland came to Ponca City upon the urging of a relative, Lt. Franklin Roosevelt Kenney, who introduced Marland to the Miller brothers - Joseph \\"Joe\\" Carson Miller, Zachary \\"Zack\\" Taylor Miller and George Lee Kockernut Miller, of the famous 101 Ranch near Ponca City. He decided that the Ranch surface geology indicated that there was oil in the area. Geology was his divining rod, he said, a science yet to be proven in the hunt for crude. Marland returned to Pittsburgh and raised $500,000Estimates of initial capital vary from between $500,000 to $1,000,000. The Offering Bill for 101 Ranch Oil Company @1909 is held by the CONOCO museum, Ponca City, Oklahoma. for a new oil venture, naming it the 101 Ranch Oil Company with himself as President and taking into the company as directors, O.

Kenney, a retired chair manufacturer, George Miller of the 101 Ranch, and Marland’s father-in-law, Samuel Collins who was also elected Treasurer. Drilling for oil Upon his return to the ranch he began drilling. The first well located near the \\"White House\\", the ranch headquarters for the Miller brothers' 101 Ranch, was a 2,500 foot dry well. The next seven wells were uneconomic gas wells and by 1910 the company was on the verge of failure.\\"E. W. Marland: Life and Death of an Oil Man\\", John Joseph Mathews, Pg. 80. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, (1985): . Restructure Then John G. McCaskey, the “Sauerkraut King”, a wealthy investor and young Pittsburgh adulthood friend of Marland’s reorganized the Company. Elected President, McCaskey raised funds from Pittsburgh investors including W. H. McFadden, a retired Carnegie Steel Company executive and J. M. Weaver, a business associate of McCaskey’s.

However, the hill Marland picked was a burial ground for the Ponca tribe. Actually the Ponca bound their dead, laid them upon scaffolds and wild animals devoured them. These scaffolds were on the crest of the hill in the exact location that Marland wanted to drill. Marland and the Millers met with White Eagle, Chief of the Ponca and emerged with permission to drill off the crest of the hill on an allotment owned by the Ponca Indian, Willie-Cries. For a $1,000 annual payment and a 12.5% override, a lease was obtained from Willie-Cries, and on June 11, 1911, that well “Willie-Cries-For-War” struck oil and stayed in production until 1976, bringing wealth to the company and its investors.

It is also called Raboso Piave, from the name of a river near where it is grown. It produces deep-colored wine, with notably high levels of tannin and medium alcohol content and high acid. The name raboxo in the native Venetian language means \\"angry\\", because angry is the sensation in the mouth when this wine is drunk young. Raboso was in the past the most cultivated grape variety of eastern Veneto; Venetian navigators called it vin de viajo, \\"wine of travel\\", because it was the most resistant to aging and transport. Its popularity decreased in the 20th century, and today the vineyards of Raboxo are just 1–2% of the total amount of vineyards in Veneto. The vine ripens relatively quite late, producing good yields with high resistance to fungal disease and rot.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 210 Mitchell Beazley 1986 The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J.

Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a varietal, neutral flavour which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous- astringent. Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can have high yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down. Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of wild violets with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, astringent. In food and wine pairing, it can go with furred and feathered game, red meat, grilled meats and well-matured cheeses.

Born in Grand Forks, North Dakota Shortridge grew up in Maryland and Colorado before relocating to the Pacific Northwest. She now resides in Seattle, Washington with her Australian husband, Matt Gani. Citing an unhappy home life with a mentally ill mother, Shortridge ventured out on her own at the age of seventeen and began to support herself through a series of office jobs, cooking jobs, and a stint as a plumber, all the while also performing in bands as a lead singer. A job with a small advertising firm began her marketing career, leading to a position as director of sales and marketing for a Denver visual imaging firm during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1995, Shortridge \\"decided to climb back down,\\" the corporate ladder as she says, and began to write full-time as a freelance magazine features writer. Her work appeared in local, regional, and national publications including Natural Home, Mademoiselle, and Glamour. In 2003, Shortridge’s first novel, Riding with the Queen, was published by New American Library (New York, NY). The story of a young rock-and-roll singer who leaves home to escape a mentally ill mother, Riding with the Queen was not fictionalized memoir, according to Shortridge, but rather a new story using her experiences with both. In 2005, she employed similar technique for her second published novel, Eating Heaven, again by NAL, the story of a disenfranchised food writer who comes to term with life by caring for a dying uncle. In her 2008 novel, Love and Biology at the Center of the Universe, NAL, a perfectionist middle-aged woman flees her home and life after discovering her husband has been less than perfect. When She Flew, Shortridge's fourth novel, NAL Nov. 2009, was inspired by true events in Portland, OR, and tells the story of an Iraq-war vet raising his young daughter in the woods, and the policewoman who finds them and must find the courage to break the rules to help them. In 2013, Shortridge's fifth novel, Love Water Memory, will be published by Gallery Books, a division of Simon and Schuster. Inspired by a news story of an amnesiac and his fiancé, Shortridge wrote a fictional account of a woman who must become like a detective to remember who she is and what happened to her while grappling with a fiancé and the life she left behind. In 2009, Shortridge founded Seattle7Writers with author Garth Stein, a nonprofit collective of authors who promote Northwest literature and raise money and awareness for literacy in their community. Thirty-six of the fifty-plus members collaborated on a novel as a fundraiser, and it was published by Open Road Media Group in 2010 as Hotel Angeline: A Novel in 36 Voices. Shortridge organized the event and penned the first chapter. All proceeds benefit literacy. Shortridge also teaches both adults and children how to write, volunteering a good portion of her time to literacy organizations for children, including 826 Seattle. About writing, Shortridge says: \\"I am a writer because I can’t not be one. I write to examine the universal story through the personal lens. I write to put another voice, another viewpoint, out into a world where too many of the voices I hear aren’t telling my story, or my family’s and friends’ stories.

The park, which borders Forbes State Forest, was built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, who also built the Kooser Lake by damming Kooser Run. Kooser State Park is on Pennsylvania Route 31 a one-hour drive from Pittsburgh. The park is surrounded by Forbes State Forest. History The earliest settlers to the Kooser Run area told of an American Indian battle that took place near Kooser Run. A large number of war arrows and spearheads have since been found in the area. The area was also crossed by participants in the Whiskey Rebellion. The park is named for John Kooser. He settled near Kooser Spring in what is now the western edge of Kooser State Park. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the land for Kooser State Park in 1922. The land had been stripped of its old- growth forest during the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The forests slowly grew back with the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The CCC established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression built a camp on the western edge of Kooser State Park. The young men of the CCC built the dam on Kooser Run creating Kooser Lake. They also built roads, outdoor fireplaces and cabins. Much of their work can still be seen today at Kooser State Park. They used the materials at hand to create the buildings and facilities of the park. The cabins are made from logs plucked from the nearby forests. They used native stone to create the fireplaces. All repairs made to the park facilities today are made with the rustic nature of the park in mind. Cross country skiing during the winter season at the park. The Kooser State Park Family Cabin District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, as a national historic district. The district includes 13 contributing buildings. Note: This includes Recreation Cabins and camping There are nine cabins built by the CCC available for rent year-round. The cabins are primarily used by skiers after deer season until late March. The cabins are rustic. A modern showerhouse is nearby. All of the cabins are furnished with mattresses, chairs, table, stove, microwave, refrigerator, hot and cold running water, and electric lights. The campground at Kooser State Park is open the second Friday in April and closes in mid-October. There are 47 sites that are open to tents or campers. 14 of the campsites have electric hook ups. Trails The trails of Kooser State Park are used for hiking and cross- country skiing. Kooser Trail is . It is very popular with cross country skiers because of the heavy amounts of yearly snowfall. Kincora Trail is and is used by hikers and is named in honor of Father Kincora, a Roman Catholic priest from Ireland. Hunting is not permitted at Kooser State Park, but the trails are used by hunters who rent cabins at the park to reach the woods of Forbes State Forest. Kooser Lake Kooser Lake is a man-made lake built during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The swimming beach is open from Memorial Day weekend until the middle of September. There are no lifeguards. There is no swimming currently permitted in Kooser Lake. Boating is not permitted on Kooser Lake. It is open to fishing for trout, bass and bluegill. Swimming has not been permitted at the lake since mid-2012 due to an unhealthful algae problem. The lake remains open for fishing. As of August 2016, according to a Park Ranger the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will work on the lake to deepen it in 2017.

Bush's administration and his war on terror. Haynes resigned as general counsel effective March 2008. He had been general counsel of the Department of the Army during the administration of the 41st president, George H.W. Bush, a partner with the law firm of Jenner & Block, an associate general counsel of General Dynamics Corporation, and, beginning in 2008, chief corporate counsel of Chevron Corporation. Haynes is currently general counsel and executive vice president of SIGA Technologies, Inc. Childhood and education Haynes was born in Waco, Texas, to William James Haynes and his wife. His family moved frequently during his childhood. He participated in the Boy Scouts while growing up, eventually achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. In 1976 Haynes graduated from Parkway High School in Bossier City, Louisiana, where he played tennis and won a state championship in wrestling. Haynes earned an ROTC scholarship to attend Davidson College. During college Haynes played varsity tennis and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa, and he graduated cum laude in 1980. Haynes received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1983. During his second year at Harvard, Haynes volunteered at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. At the time, the president of the bureau was Deval Patrick, future Governor of Massachusetts, who was a year ahead of Haynes in law school. Following law school, Haynes spent a year as a law clerk to U.S. District Judge James B. McMillan, an appointee of President Lyndon B. Johnson who famously ordered that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County school system should integrate by means of crosstown busing. Early public service and private sector work Following his clerkship, Haynes was commissioned an army second lieutenant through the ROTC program and entered active duty in 1984. He served four years, advising and representing the Department of the Army in matters ranging from international research and development agreements, to hazardous waste cleanups, to government contracts. Haynes was twice awarded the Army Meritorious Service Medal, in 1986 and again in 1988. After leaving active duty, Haynes briefly worked as an associate at the D.C. law firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan before being tapped by President George H. W. Bush to be general counsel of the Department of the Army. Haynes was confirmed in early 1990 and remained through noon of inauguration day in 1993, serving as chief legal officer of the army during the period of the conclusion of the Cold War, the liberation of Kuwait during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and the beginning of the contraction of the defense industry. In 1993, Haynes joined the D.C. office of Jenner & Block as a partner. Upon moving to General Dynamics Corporation in 1996, Haynes was initially staff vice president and associate general counsel, and later general counsel for the company's Marine Group. In early 1999, Haynes spent four months as a volunteer in central Asia working on microcredit programs for Mercy Corps International, before returning to his partnership at Jenner & Block. General Counsel of the Department of Defense Shortly after his inauguration, President George W. Bush appointed Haynes to be General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Donald Rumsfeld was the 21st Secretary of Defense from 2001 to 2006 under President George W. Bush. In his capacity as general counsel, Haynes oversaw some 10,000 lawyers, and advised on the department's internal affairs and its relations with other government and non- government agencies at home and abroad. Because of the position's wide-ranging responsibility for overseeing thousands of ongoing cases, legislative matters, and policy decisions, the DoD's general counsel has been described as \\"one of the most powerful and influential lawyers in the entire federal government.\\" Haynes was in one of the Pentagon's command centers on September 11, 2001, when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the western face of the building. At the time, Haynes was on the far side of the Pentagon. Later, during the 2008 Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Lecture before the American College of Trial Lawyers, he recalled feeling \\"a shudder pulse the monstrous concrete structure,\\" and that he sent a deputy of his to a survival site, in case any additional attacks were to affect the Pentagon. As general counsel, Haynes was often sent to meet with foreign officials. In 2003, for instance, he met with British Attorney General Peter Goldsmith to discuss the cases of two British men held in Guantanamo Bay (a total of six British residents were held there). In 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates dispatched Haynes to Turkey to speak with officials about militants in the country thought to be using U.S.-supplied weaponry. Haynes also advised the Bush administration in its effort to create military commissions that would try detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The commissions were authorized by Military Commission Order No. 1, which Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued on March 21, 2002. No detainees were tried under the provisions of that order. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the commissions were unconstitutional, and that Congressional authorization was required before any commissions could commence. Col. Morris Davis, the former chief prosecutor of military commissions at Guantanamo described how he was pressured into indicting Guantanamo prisoners for war crimes as soon as the Military Commissions Act was signed into law by Bush in October 2006 and even before the \\"Manual for Military Commissions\\" was prepared and no \\"convening authority\\" to oversee was appointed yet. His experience was that of receiving a call from William \\"Jim\\" Haynes as early as January 2007 asking him how quickly he could charge the Australian prisoner David Hicks.Former Guantanamo Chief Pro [secutor: David Hicks' War Crimes Charge Was a \\"Favor\\" for Australia In chapter 13 (pp. 213–237) of her book The Dark Side, Jane Mayer describes how Alberto Mora, then the general counsel of the US Navy, as early as 2003 mounted a challenge to the interrogation policy used by the United States which he saw as potentially leading to war crimes charges. Mora reportedly warned William J. Haynes, Donald Rumsfeld's chief counsel, to \\"protect your client!\\" To rebut Mora's and others' concerns about the legality of the conduct of the interrogation policy followed not only by DoD personnel but also by the CIA, William J. Haynes apparently solicited an opinion from John C. Yoo, then in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which opinion, in spite of being based on a questionable legal foundation, countenanced \\"enhanced interrogation techniques.\\" For reasons which Haynes never disclosed, this opinion was adopted as official policy in spite of Mora's objections. Underlining his rebuke, Haynes never informed Mora that the policy adopted by the DoD took no account of Mora's objections.New Yorker’s Jane Mayer details ‘Dark Side’ of the war on terror Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, who briefly worked at the Pentagon as Special Counsel under Haynes before becoming head of the Office of Legal Counsel, United States Department of Justice (2003-2004), notes in his book, The Terror Presidency (2007), that at the time Haynes did urge the powers that be in the Bush administration to seek and obtain Congressional authorization for the policy and military commissions, but that others in the administration felt doing so was unnecessary. In November 2002, Haynes wrote a memo for Rumsfeld concerning interrogation techniques to be used at Guantanamo Bay. This followed what were known as the Torture Memos of August 2002, largely written by Yoo and issued by the Office of Legal Counsel to the CIA and DOD, with two signed as well by Jay S. Bybee. These also authorized the use of so-called \\"enhanced interrogation techniques,\\" brutal interrogation tactics that are widely considered to be torture. Haynes's memo, which the Secretary of Defense approved, recommended authorizing several techniques, but advised against the authorization of three more-aggressive techniques, including one that resembled waterboarding. Such treatment of detainees, Haynes noted, would be inconsistent with American Armed Forces' \\"tradition of restraint.\\" That memo led journalist Stuart Taylor to write, in a 2008 article for the National Journal, that Haynes \\"is the only former [Bush administration] official whose paper trail also shows that he blocked a request to use waterboarding and two other harsh methods that administration lawyers had advised were legal....\\" Brookings Institution fellow Benjamin Wittes went further in the pages of the New Republic, claiming Haynes's memo \\"the reason that the military, unlike the CIA, never waterboarded anybody.\\" While the memo was criticized for recommending techniques that were used abusively at Abu Ghraib in Iraq and elsewhere, it did not apply to interrogators working anywhere outside Guantanamo Bay. But, on March 14, 2003, five days before the United States began the invasion of Iraq, John Yoo of the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel issued a legal opinion/memo to Haynes, concluding that federal laws related to the use of torture of prisoners and suspects did not apply to interrogations overseas.Michael Isikoff, \\"A Top Pentagon Lawyer Faces a Senate Grilling on Torture\\" (abstract/access via Questia Online Library), The Daily Beast/Newsweek, 5 April 2008, accessed 18 January 2013 In August 2004, the Independent Panel to Review Department of Defense Detention Operations, which was convened in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal that broke in April 2004, issued a report claiming that the methods Haynes recommended were \\"strictly limited for use at Guantanamo\\" and that officers there \\"used those...techniques with only two detainees, gaining important and time sensitive information in the process.\\" The panel's report faulted Haynes for formulating his November 2002 interrogation memo to the Secretary of Defense without giving greater consideration to the input of Judge Advocates General and the general counsels of the armed services. The authors of the report suggest that had Haynes done so, the military might not have needed to revise its Guantanamo interrogation standards in April 2003, following objections from some within the military that the standards adopted in late-2002 might lead to abuse of detainees. In March 2008, Haynes resigned from his position at the Pentagon. His nearly seven years in office made him the longest-serving general counsel in the history of the Department of Defense. Upon his departure, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates awarded Haynes the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest award for a civilian appointee. Fourth Circuit nomination In 2003, Haynes was nominated by George W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. During the more than three years that Haynes's nomination was pending, the American Bar Association evaluated him twice and both times rated him Well-Qualified, the highest rating given to judicial nominees. Haynes received the support of a number of prominent lawyers, including Cass Sunstein and former NAACP Legal Defense Fund chairman William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr. The Judiciary Committee approved Haynes's nomination in November 2003, but he did not receive a vote in the full Senate. Although re-nominated in subsequent Congresses, Haynes never moved past the committee level. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was revealed to be the principal opponent to the appointment. In December 2006, after the Senate adjourned following the Democratic gains of the 2006 elections, Haynes asked President Bush to forego re-nominating him to the Court of Appeals. Scott Horton in a February 2008 blog in Harper's noted that Graham was a reserve judge in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) and had opposed Haynes' conflicts with JAG lawyers at Defense.Scott Horton, \\"Jim Haynes' Long Twilight Struggle\\", Harper's Magazine, February 2008, accessed 18 January 2013 Dick Durbin questions Senator Dick Durbin asked questions of Brett Kavanaugh during his District Court confirmation in 2006 regarding the vetting of Haynes for a nomination to the federal bench, saying \\"At the time of the Haynes nomination, what did you know about Mr. Haynes' role in crafting the administration's detention and interrogation policies?\\" Kavanaugh responded, \\"Senator, I did not -- I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants or -- and so I do not have the involvement with that.\\" \\"And with respect to Mr. Haynes' nomination, I've -- I know Jim Haynes, but it was not one of the nominations that I handled.\\" But in 2007 Durbin read a Washington Post reportPushing the Envelope on Presidential Power, Washington Post, Barton Gellman & Jo Becker, June 25, 2007.

In 1997, Dominick's phased out Omni and converted the stores into Dominick's because the concept was not generating enough revenue compared to other Dominick's stores. History Opening Typical Omni Superstore Floorplan. In April 1987, Dominick's Finer Foods opened the first Omni Superstore in the Lake View Plaza in Orland Park, Illinois, at the corner of 159th Street and LaGrange Road. Dominick's created Omni Superstore in order to compete with the introduction of Cub Foods into the Chicago grocery market in the mid 1980s. Dominick's and their developers referred to Omni Superstore as a Cub Foods with more pizazz. Omni Superstore was Dominick's reaction and answer to the low prices and warehouse/no frills attitude that Cub Foods possessed. (Cub Foods eventually left the Chicago Market in 2006 due to anti- trust regulations; its parent company Supervalu acquired the Jewel-Osco chain.) 17 more stores were to follow in the next 10 years in the Chicago metropolitan area. Omni would eventually be phased out by Dominick's for various reasons ranging from consumer preference to responding to competition from new stores such as Meijer (first Chicago-area store opened in August 1999), Whole Foods and Wal-Mart entering the Chicago market.  Entry into Indiana  Omni Superstore 1991 Schererville, Indiana Canopy for Loading Groceries. Dominick's opened an Omni Superstore in 1991 in Schererville, Indiana. The store became a Dominick's in 1997 and closed in 1999 and sat empty for four years. When Omni Superstore moved into Strack & Van Til's home territory of Northwest Indiana in 1991, Strack's posted billboards that said \\"We still bag em\\" referring to the fact that Strack's still bagged your groceries but customers at Omni have to bag their own items. Omni Superstore and Strack & Van Til competed effectively and both sustained loyal customers and good business, up until the fallout of Omni Superstore to Dominick's. Dominick's also planned for there to be an Omni Superstore in Hammond, Indiana at the Hammond Mills shopping center at 165th and Indianapolis Boulevard. The Hammond Omni Superstore opened as a Dominick's in January 1999. Due to the local shopping habits of consumers in Hammond, Dominick's European higher price point Fresh Store did not succeed in Hammond and the store closed 7 months later. This was Dominick's final exit out of the Indiana market. Expansion and conversion to Dominick's Omni Superstore continued to add stores under the leadership of Dominick's. However, the Omni format was not doing as well as the Dominick's Fresh stores, so Domimick's announced in October 1997 that the Omni stores would be changed to the Fresh format. Prior to the sale of Dominick's to Safeway, it was suggested in Crain's Chicago Business that a potential buyer might have done well to expand the Omni stores beyond Chicago. Many of the Omni stores converted to Dominick's closed because many customers were used to shopping at Omni for lower prices and a \\"no frills\\" type shopping experience. Even though the store decor was much improved and gave a European feel, many regular customers fled because prices increased dramatically. In 1998, Dominick's was purchased by Safeway. The fresh market concept was eliminated and many poorly performing stores were later closed. Former OMNI superstore in Round Lake Beach that was converted into a Dominick's in 1997. This store closed in 2007 and was demolished eight years later. The Clybourn Avenue Dominick's in Chicago is the remaining Omni Superstore buildings now occupied by Dominick's. According to a Dominick's manager, the Dominick's that opened in Matteson, Illinois in 1989 was supposed to be opened as an Omni Superstore, but at the last minute was changed to a Dominick's due to municipality issues. In 1997 in nearby Chicago Heights, Illinois the Sun Times reported construction began on a Omni Superstore, which never opened at the northwest corner of Lincoln Hwy and Western Avenue. Additionally, according to the Northwest Indiana Times newspaper, the Dominick's that opened in Hammond, Indiana in 1999 was supposed to be an Omni Superstore as well. This store opened as a Dominick's and closed within 7 months. It was later reopened as a Kroger under the name of Food4Less. Safeway appears to be keeping the rights to the Omni name by using it on a line of organic store brand foods in Dominick's and other Safeway stores. Legacy Current Marianos, Former Dominick's/Omni styled location on Cumberland Avenue, Park Ridge, IL The CEO of Dominick's, Bob Mariano, who also ran the Omni Superstore discount division, has created a chain of stores in the Chicago area under the Mariano's banner. The Mariano's banner clearly shows a store operations model and store design similar to that of the Bob Mariano run Omni Superstore. Some features include: -Open exposed ceiling structure with a warehouse loft style feeling. -Employees are only allowed to wear black and white. Men must wear a dress shirt and black tie, while women wear more casual black and white attire. -Overhead Paging is quite frequent. -A large presence of ethnic and local products tailored to the neighborhood. -A large bulk food aisle with Costco styled multi packs. -A store footprint that closely resembles that of an Omni/Dominick's under Mariano's leadership. Store Layout Omni Superstore Graphics and Departmental Naming Typical Omni Superstore 1988. Omni Superstore featured a bakery, Hero's Deli, Field Fresh Produce Section, Great Lakes Seafood, The Dairy Depot, The Greenery Floral Department, 1 hour photo department, large general merchandise department, Homestyle home goods department, The Cheese Shop, cosmetics counter, pharmacy department, and a wholesale/family pack foods area with large 20' orange industrial steel shelving that separated the general merchandise area from the grocery area. Early Omni Superstore's contained a video department while newer ones dropped this department. The Orland Park Omni had a separate Video store entrance next to the exit doors. Departmental names were synonymous with Chicago, the Midwest and Great Lakes. This was highly innovative as most US grocery stores at the time, called departments simply, \\"produce,\\" \\"dairy,\\" and \\"meat department.\\" This new naming convention was the responsibility of the team of Louis Germano, Director of Dominick's store planning, Schafer Associates who was Omni's project architect and Jarob Design/Programmed Products who were responsible for the signage and graphics. Store layout Omni Superstore 1991 Schererville, Indiana Checkout Area. Except for Round Lake Beach, IL and McHenry, IL Omni, which was laid out like a conventional Dominick's, most all Omni's followed a similar layout. The only deviation from this was the constant experimentation of where to place the 1 hour photo department/electronics counter and cosmetics counters. Orland Park Omni had the Cosmetics at the back of the store with the 1 hour photo on a mezzanine, while Aurora had the 1 hour photo counter directly next to the pharmacy while Crestwood and Schererville had the cosmetics at the front on the other side of the wall from the Hero's Deli. Merchandising and store layout experimentation was frequent at Omni. Although the stores followed the basic floor plan, each Omni had a different feel than the other. There were no \\"flipped floor plan\\" Omni's. That is, you entered every Omni on the right hand side of the building and exited on the Left side of the building. A large 15' wide aisle led customers from the front entrance directly towards the back of the store. On the right, perpendicular to the main aisle, were the general merchandise shelving gondolas. A tall mezzanine housed the 1 Hour Photo Department in the center of these general merchandise aisles. To the left of the main front to back walkway was the large 20' shelving and beyond that the grocery department, which was larger than the general merchandise aisle and consisted of over 15 aisles. The produce department and bakery were located at the far left end of the store. Unlike most supermarkets where the produce department is near the main entrance, the \\"Field Fresh Produce\\" department, \\"The Greenery\\" floral department and Main Bakery were located at the last stop before the checkouts. The Hero's Deli was located directly to the right of the entrance in the general merchandise area. Customers were forced to walk through the deli area and naturally walk through the general merchandise area before they made it to the grocery section. A section called Omni \\"Superbuys\\" was located in the general merchandise area, which featured deep discount items. Space-frame canopies held signage and lighting at many of the departments along the back wall near Great Lakes Seafood, Dairy Depot, Meat Department, Field Fresh Produce, and the Greenery. The department names were labeled with different fonts and different graphics mounted on the space-frame canopy. Early locations used Ceramic Metal Halide lighting, while later stores used industrial strip fluorescent lighting. An Average Omni Superstore was . to ., while its sister Dominick's Food and Drug combo stores ranged around . Other Unique Features Omni Superstore 1991 Schererville, Indiana Main Walkway at Checkouts. The first Omni Superstore in Orland Park originally used a large black 10' high banding with photographs of the different items in the department on the perimeter walls. This was eventually painted over and a white and orange color scheme with an orange band running the length of the perimeter walls. A large \\"flying wave\\" Orange and White banner was hung in a curved wavy fashion over the entire grocery sales area. Early stores said \\"Lower Prices Overall\\" while the newer stores said \\"Discount Food and Drug.\\" Since 1988, St. Paul Federal Bank was the main banking center in the Illinois Omni Superstores. In Indiana, Centier Bank opened a branch in the Indiana Omni Store.

He was the eighth mayor of Washington, D.C. from 1824 to 1827. Weightman was born in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1787, moving into the new capital in 1800 and taking an apprenticeship with a local printer. Weightman bought the printing business in 1807,http://www.geocities.com/heartland/plains/7347/rogchew2.html making him a congressional printer. He maintained a number of shops on Pennsylvania Avenue, about ten blocks from the White House, from about 1813 onward. In August 1814, Weightman (by now a First Lieutenant in D.C.'s Light Horse CavalryHistoric Congressional Cemetery - D.C. Schools ) was apprehended by the British troops descending on the White House during the Siege of Washington, a battle in the War of 1812, and made to march with them to the Executive Mansion. Rear Admiral George Cockburn made Weightmann accompany the invaders into the mansion where the admiral teased him with mischievous relish. When Cockburn told him to select a memento of the visit, Weightman chose an item of value, only to be told by the admiral that everything of value would be destroyed and the he must instead select a worthless souvenir. Weightman choose a souvenir (albeit one of no monetary value) to remember the day the American capital was defeated.The White House Historical Association > Research Mayor of Washington D.C. After serving seven one-year terms as an alderman on Washington's city council, the council elected Weightman in 1824 to serve out the remainder of the late mayor Samuel N. Smallwood's term. In 1826 he ran against former mayor Thomas Carbery; four years prior, Weightman had run against Carbery for mayor and lost by a narrow margin, but had then pressed the matter in court in a legal battle that lasted until the end of Carbery's term. In 1824, Weightman won more decisively by the use of blustery promises and insults against his opponent. One handbill from the era reads, > NOTICE EXTRAORDINARY. R.C. Weightman, a man of known liberal principles; all > those who vote for this gentleman at tomorrow's election, will have general > permission to sleep on the Benches in the Market House, this intense warm > weather.

He would run again, unsuccessfully, against Walter Lenox in 1850. In the years following his mayoralty, Weightman would be curator of the Columbia Institute; a founding member and officer of the Washington National Monument Society; Grand Master of the Freemasons of the District of Columbia; chief clerk, and later librarian, of the United States Patent Office; and a General in the Union Army during the Civil War -- not to mention the center of Washington's social activity. In addition to his busy social and professional life, Weightman was a noted and generous philanthropist -- generous enough that his sizable fortune had dwindled to very little by the 1870s, when Weightman was living on his pension as a soldier and employee of the Patent Office. However, upon his death on February 2, 1876, his funeral was one of the best attended and most remembered of the era. Thomas Jefferson's last letter The last letter that Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States and the writer of the Declaration of Independence, ever wrote was sent to Roger C. Weightman. It was a letter declining an invitation to join a celebration for the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The letter says: Columbian Institute During the 1820s, Weightman was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. Honors A school built at 23rd and M, NW in 1887 was named the Weightman School in his honor. It later became the Roger C. Weightman School for Crippled Children and still later Roger C.

In it, West describes his diagnosis, treatment, and personal experiences. Summary West recovers memories of early childhood sexual abuse and is diagnosed with DID as an adult. The book chronicles the first few years of his struggle to accept and heal from his disorder. West describes a system of 24 different personalities that emerge one by one. The presence of personalities is tied to flashbacks West experiences in which he is molested by his mother and grandmother as well as one or more unidentified male perpetrators. Alters emerge who either hold memories of West's abuse, carry the pain of the experience, or protect West's psyche in one way or another. One personality, named Switch, physically injures West's body in an effort to release pain. Unlike the classic \\"Sybil\\" (Shirley Ardell Mason), West experiences co-consciousness and doesn't have fugue states. Throughout his long journey to acceptance, West undergoes intensive therapy, and through hospitalizations in DID-centered programs, meets many people who share his condition. His wife Rikki's constant support as well as his love for her and his son motivate West to accept his abuse and begin to heal from the damage it did to his psyche. One chapter, written entirely from Rikki's point of view, depicts her attempts to understand. In the final pages, West allows himself to be videotaped as his alters emerge and speak. After viewing this tape, West begins to fully realize and accept the exact nature of his condition and his denial begins to abate. West pursues the study of psychology and is awarded a Ph.D. Analysis West writes First Person Plural using a first-person omniscient style, in which he is typically the narrator, but the reader can still see scenes that don't involve the narrator. West struggles with denial of his condition for several years, beginning with the first “takeovers” of his body, until at last he begins to accept that his condition developed to protect him from the psychological experience of repeated childhood sexual abuse. West writes that he authored the book to present the public and treatment professionals with a first-hand account of DID so that others could more fully understand this often misdiagnosed condition. Furthermore, West states he wished to reach out to others like himself to show them that “they aren't alone, that there is hope.” Reception A review in Time called the book \\"awkwardly written\\", but the book reached The New York Times bestseller list for two weeks in March 1999. Sales of the book were boosted by the author's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Screen rights for a potential film were purchased by Disney for $1.15 million and Robin Williams was cast to play West. However the film was never completed.

Pre-World War II Originally built, as accommodation for British Imperial Garrison troops, including the 12th and 40th Regiment of Foot who were involved in putting down the armed Eureka Stockade rebellion in Ballarat, Victoria, and later the Colony of Victoria's colonial forces. The Barracks housed the Department of Defence from the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia (Federation) in 1901 until 1958 when the Department of Defence moved to the new Russell Offices in Canberra. The earliest building (G Block) at Victoria Barracks was built by soldiers on the 40th Regiment, under the supervision of a Royal Engineer officer, from 1856 to 1858, while the remaining buildings were built by civil contractors with the original bluestone buildings being constructed between 1856 and 1872. A large extension (A Block New Wing) was added to accommodate HQ Department of Defence in 1917 and while it looked like the original A Block building the construction method and interior was completely modern for the time. In 1936 the Repatriation Commission took control of a parcel of land on the corner of St Kilda Rd and Coventry St to establish the Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic, which opened on 15 November 1937. The day clinic was designed by Commonwealth architect George Hallendal in an Art Deco style for World War 1 veterans. Another modern, for the time, art deco building (M Block) was added in 1939 and the floor was the first continuous concrete pour in Australia. The Barracks were named in honour of Queen Victoria. There are also Victoria Barracks in Sydney and Brisbane. World War II During World War II, Victoria Barracks Melbourne housed the Australian War Cabinet. The War Cabinet comprised senior MP's from the Government and Opposition parties. The Defence Secretariat occupied the second floor of 'A Block New Wing' which also contained the office of senior military staff, the Secretary of the Department Defence (Sir Frederick Shedden), visiting Ministers of State and their secretaries and support staff, and the War Cabinet room. The wartime Prime Ministers (Robert Menzies and later John Curtin) also had offices near the War Cabinet Room throughout the War. Eric Nave's Navy cryptographic unit was at Victoria Barracks until it moved to FRUMEL. Myth has it that the US General Douglas MacArthur had an office at the barracks however this is not true as his HQ was at the Hotel Australia in the Melbourne CBD. It was in fact General Sir Thomas Blamey who had his HQ at the Barracks while serving as Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces, and simultaneously in international command as Commander-in-Chief Allied Land Forces in the South-West Pacific Area under MacArthur. Post-World War II Victoria Barracks Melbourne currently accommodates: * Land Systems Division (LSD) of the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group * The ten Systems Program Offices (SPO) (business units) of LSD * Elements of Joint Logistics Command (JLC) * Elements of Estate and Infrastructure Group (E&IG;) * Senior Naval Officer - Victoria (SNO-Vic) Non-Defence organisations within Victoria Barracks include: * Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) library in B-Block * Defence Force Welfare Association (DFWA) in H-Block * Broadspectrum Defence contractors providing support services to Defence * Australian Military Bank in H-Block * Defence Bank in H-Block * Australian Federal Police detachment A number of facilities within Victoria Barracks are named after notable military events, people or places. These include: * The Shedden Auditorium (after Sir Frederick Shedden) * The War Cabinet Room (used as the main conference room for the World War II War Cabinet) * The Blamey Room (after Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey GBE, KCB, CMG, DSO, ED) * The Tresco Room (after the Tresco Estate, the Royal Australian Navy's premier residence in Sydney) The former Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic built prior to World War 2 was handed back to Defence in 1975 and was used as the Maintenance Engineering Agency (MEA) until December 1995. The former Repatriation Clinic has been empty since 1995. In 2016 the Australian Labor Party (ALP) released a policy to turn the clinic into an Australian National Veterans Arts Centre (ANVAC) following lobbying by the Australian National Veterans Arts Museum (ANVAM). The Department of Defence indicated in 2016 the former Repatriation Clinic would be sold and later indicated negotiations where underway to transfer the property to the State Government of Victoria. When the State Government indicated it was not interested in acquiring the site in 2019 a new line of enquiry was opened with the City if Melbourne to acquire the site.

The Early Germans of New Jersey: Their History, Churches, and Genealogies. (Dover, New Jersey, Dover Printing Company, 1895), 631 ff. Construction of a stone house of worship was finished in 1771. Stillwater and the surrounding Paulins Kill valley was settled chiefly by Palatine German immigrants in the 18th Century, beginning in 1741 with the arrival of Casper Shafer, John George Wintermute, Johan Peter Bernhardt and their families.Schaeffer, Casper M.D. (and Johnson, William M.).

The Wintermute Family History. (Columbus, Ohio: The Champlin Press, 1900). The first few families likely held prayer services in their homes with their neighbors. Early Stillwater families are mentioned in the records of the Dutch Reformed congregations in the Minisink Valley (along the Delaware River), and likely journeyed over Kittatinny Mountain to attend services in Walpack. As the area's population grew and the village of Stillwater developed, its Christian community was served by clergymen who travelled a circuit of churches in remote, sparsely-inhabited regions. Clergymen were provided as \\"stated supply\\" by the Dutch Reformed or Calvinist Synod (or Classis) in New Brunswick, New Jersey or the Lutheran Church (Evangelical Lutheran Ministerium) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The congregation did not have a permanent clergyman until the 1780s. From 1769-1771, a church building was constructed from local fieldstone in the older section of Stillwater Cemetery. This church, known as the Dutch Meeting House, Reformed Association of Hardwick, and Lutheran Congregation of Hardwick, served the large German population that settled the Paulins Kill valley and the surrounding area in the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1823, with the area's German population either dying off, migrating to territories in the American West or assimilating into English-oriented American culture, the congregation petitioned the Presbytery of Newton to affiliate with the Presbyterian faith. By the 1830s, the stone church was beginning to become structurally unsound, and the current structure, an frame structure that is an example of Greek Revival architecture, although featuring Gothic Revival (Carpenter Gothic) windows, was erected in 1837-1838 at a cost of $2,000.First Presbyterian Church of Stillwater - Church History (accessed 23 June 2012)Snell, James P.

It is likely the third structure used by this congregation—the first presumed to be a rudimentary log building erected circa 1745-1750 that occupied the site in the Stillwater Cemetery of the fieldstone structure which succeeded it. Local tradition asserts that the fieldstone wall of Stillwater Cemetery was built with stones from the abandoned stone structure when it was dismantled in 1847. A stone with \\"1771\\" carved into its face (likely the cornerstone from the former structure) is incorporated into the cemetery gate.

He directed Hindustan Lever during the important transitional phase of Indian management. He was the first Indian Chairman of Hindustan Lever Ltd. (now known as Hindustan Unilever Ltd.). A Chartered Accountant, trained in London, he was one of the pioneers of professional management in India. He also served as the chairman of the State Trading Corporation and Punjab National Bank and is credited with earning distinction as a CEO who for his systems, efficiency and honesty in running PSU's. In 1974 Reserve Bank of India constituted a study group headed by Shri Prakash Tandon, the then Chairman of Punjab National Bank, with a view to study the entire gamut of Bank's finance for working capital and suggest ways for optimum utilisation of Bank credit. This was the first elaborate attempt by the central bank to organise the Bank credit. The report of this group is widely known as Tandon Committee report. Most banks in India even today continue to look at the needs of the corporates in the light of methodology recommended by the Group. Biography Prakash Tandon was the son of a civil engineer and born in a canal colony in the Punjab. His autobiographical writings, published in the second half of the twentieth century, give vivid accounts of life in Punjab from the late nineteenth century. Following schooling in Gujarat and Lahore Government College, Tandon sailed for Britain in 1929, aged eighteen years old. His elder brother, Manohar, was already in London. Tandon enrolled at Manchester University with the view to become a Chartered Accountant, of which there were very few qualified Indians at the time. Tandon spent eight years in Britain. He got involved in the University debating team, and following his degree at Manchester stayed in London to pursue some economics research and his accountancy qualifications. At a students' congress in Oxford, he met his future wife, a Swedish woman, Gärd. In 1937, Tandon returned to India. He settled in Bombay and he eventually got a job at Unilever. Despite his accountancy qualification, Tandon was employed in the advertising department and earnt less than his British colleagues. He eventually became director of Unilever in 1951. He was a member of the first board of Hindustan Lever in 1956 and then the first Indian Chairman in 1961. Tandon was an extremely influential business leader in independent India, and one of the pioneers of professional management in India.

He wrote lyrics for most of the songs he recorded and played the outi (the Greek oud). Personal life Asikis was the third child of Victor Asikis of Lesbos and Marianthi from the Kontoskali district of Constantinople. Ever since he was a child, he thought he had an exceptional voice and bought an outi at the age of 15. He sang and played the outi for family and friends, but did not begin his professional music career until after the Asia Minor Disaster. In 1922, after the Asia Minor Disaster, Asikis and his wife, Eirene Sotiriadou, and two children, Thanasis and Victor, moved to Athens, Greece. They moved to the Vyronas section of Athens and had four more children: Anastasia, Nikolaos, Basiles, and Manolis. Career Having moved to Athens, Asikis tried to continue his professional career of fabricating bronze bed frames, but failed after six months. He would frequent a club called \\"The Asia Minor\\", the center of all laika at the time, where he was warmly accepted by contemporary musicians. In the late 1920s, he recorded music for Columbia, Odeon, and Parlophone as did other musicians at the time, like Kostas Skarvelis. In total, Grigoris Asikis recorded 82 of his songs. In the 1930s his compositions were sung by many famous artists of the time including Kostas Nouros, Roza Eskenazi, Stellakis Perpiniadis, Rita Abatzi, Marika Politissa, Kostas Roukounas, Kostas Tsanakos, Marika Kanaropoulou, and Georgia Mettake. In the later part of the decade, he abandoned composing songs with Asia Minor instruments, i.e. outi, lyre, and violin, and wrote songs using the bouzouki. Some of these songs were sung by famous artists and close friends of his Markos Vamvakaris, Yiannis Papaioannou, and Apostolos Chatzichristos.

It terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions and may also increase the treated tissues' mechanical strength or stability. Tissue fixation is a critical step in the preparation of histological sections, its broad objective being to preserve cells and tissue components and to do this in such a way as to allow for the preparation of thin, stained sections. This allows the investigation of the tissues' structure, which is determined by the shapes and sizes of such macromolecules (in and around cells) as proteins and nucleic acids.  Purposes  In performing their protective role, fixatives denature proteins by coagulation, by forming additive compounds, or by a combination of coagulation and additive processes. A compound that adds chemically to macromolecules stabilizes structure most effectively if it is able to combine with parts of two different macromolecules, an effect known as cross-linking. Fixation of tissue is done for several reasons. One reason is to kill the tissue so that postmortem decay (autolysis and putrefaction) is prevented. Fixation preserves biological material (tissue or cells) as close to its natural state as possible in the process of preparing tissue for examination. To achieve this, several conditions usually must be met. First, a fixative usually acts to disable intrinsic biomolecules—particularly proteolytic enzymes—which otherwise digest or damage the sample. Second, a fixative typically protects a sample from extrinsic damage. Fixatives are toxic to most common microorganisms (bacteria in particular) that might exist in a tissue sample or which might otherwise colonize the fixed tissue. In addition, many fixatives chemically alter the fixed material to make it less palatable (either indigestible or toxic) to opportunistic microorganisms. Finally, fixatives often alter the cells or tissues on a molecular level to increase their mechanical strength or stability. This increased strength and rigidity can help preserve the morphology (shape and structure) of the sample as it is processed for further analysis. Even the most careful fixation does alter the sample and introduce artifacts that can interfere with interpretation of cellular ultrastructure. A prominent example is the bacterial mesosome, which was thought to be an organelle in gram-positive bacteria in the 1970s, but was later shown by new techniques developed for electron microscopy to be simply an artifact of chemical fixation. Standardization of fixation and other tissue processing procedures takes this introduction of artifacts into account, by establishing what procedures introduce which kinds of artifacts. Researchers who know what types of artifacts to expect with each tissue type and processing technique can accurately interpret sections with artifacts, or choose techniques that minimize artifacts in areas of interest.  Process  Fixation is usually the first stage in a multistep process to prepare a sample of biological material for microscopy or other analysis. Therefore, the choice of fixative and fixation protocol may depend on the additional processing steps and final analyses that are planned. For example, immunohistochemistry uses antibodies that bind to a specific protein target. Prolonged fixation can chemically mask these targets and prevent antibody binding. In these cases, a 'quick fix' method using cold formalin for around 24 hours is typically used. Methanol (100%) can also be used for quick fixation, and that time can vary depending on the biological material. For example, MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells can be fixed for only 3 minutes with cold methanol (-20 °C). For enzyme localization studies, the tissues should either be pre-fixed lightly only, or post-fixed after the enzyme activity product has formed.  Types  There are generally three types of fixation processes depending on the initial specimen: Heat fixation: After a smear has dried at room temperature, the slide is gripped by tongs or a clothespin and passed through the flame of a Bunsen burner several times to heat-kill and adhere the organism to the slide. Routinely used with bacteria and archaea. Heat fixation generally preserves overall morphology but not internal structures. Heat denatures the proteolytic enzyme and prevents autolysis. Heat fixation cannot be used in the capsular stain method as heat fixation will shrink or destroy the capsule (glycocalyx) and cannot be seen in stains. Immersion: The sample of tissue is immersed in fixative solution of volume at a minimum of 20 times greater than the volume of the tissue to be fixed. The fixative must diffuse through the tissue to fix, so tissue size and density, as well as type of fixative must be considered. This is a common technique for cellular applications. Using a larger sample means it takes longer for the fixative to reach the deeper tissue. Perfusion: Fixation via blood flow. The fixative is injected into the heart with the injection volume matching cardiac output. The fixative spreads through the entire body, and the tissue doesn't die until it is fixed. This has the advantage of preserving perfect morphology, but the disadvantages are that the subject dies and the cost of the volume of fixative needed for larger organisms is high.  Chemical fixation  In both immersion and perfusion fixation processes, chemical fixatives are used to preserve structures in a state (both chemically and structurally) as close to living tissue as possible. This requires a chemical fixative.  Crosslinking fixatives – aldehydes  Crosslinking fixatives act by creating covalent chemical bonds between proteins in tissue. This anchors soluble proteins to the cytoskeleton, and lends additional rigidity to the tissue. Preservation of transient or fine cytoskeletal structure such as contractions during embryonic differentiation waves is best achieved by a pretreatment using microwaves before the addition of a cross linking fixative.Rapid Microwave Fixation of Cell Monolayers Preserves Microtubule-associated Cell Structures J Histochem Cytochem. 2008 Jul; 56(7): 697–709. doi: 10.1369/jhc.7A7370.2008Gordon, N. Gordon, R.Embryogenesis Explained World Scientific Publishing, Singapore, 2016 pg 527 The most commonly used fixative in histology is formaldehyde. It is usually used as a 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), that is approx. 3.7%–4.0% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7. Since formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, formalin – formaldehyde gas dissolved in water (~37% w/v) – is used when making the former fixative. Formaldehyde fixes tissue by cross- linking the proteins, primarily the residues of the basic amino acid lysine. Its effects are reversible by excess water and it avoids formalin pigmentation. Paraformaldehyde is also commonly used and will depolymerise back to formalin when heated, also making it an effective fixative. Other benefits to paraformaldehyde include long term storage and good tissue penetration. It is particularly good for immunohistochemistry techniques. The formaldehyde vapor can also be used as a fixative for cell smears. Another popular aldehyde for fixation is glutaraldehyde. It operates similarly to formaldehyde, causing the deformation of proteins' α-helices. However glutaraldehyde is a larger molecule than formaldehyde, and so permeates membranes more slowly. Consequently, glutaraldehyde fixation on thicker tissue samples can be difficult; this can be troubleshot by reducing the size of the tissue sample. One of the advantages of glutaraldehyde fixation is that it may offer a more rigid or tightly linked fixed product--its greater length and two aldehyde groups allow it to 'bridge' and link more distant pairs of protein molecules. It causes rapid and irreversible changes, is well suited for electron microscopy, works well at 4 °C, and gives the best overall cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. It is, however, not ideal for immunohistochemistry staining. Some fixation protocols call for a combination of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde so that their respective strengths complement one another. These crosslinking fixatives, especially formaldehyde, tend to preserve the secondary structure of proteins and may also preserve most tertiary structure.  Precipitating fixatives – alcohols  Precipitating (or denaturing) fixatives act by reducing the solubility of protein molecules and often by disrupting the hydrophobic interactions that give many proteins their tertiary structure. The precipitation and aggregation of proteins is a very different process from the crosslinking that occurs with aldehyde fixatives. The most common precipitating fixatives are ethanol and methanol. They are commonly used to fix frozen sections and smears. Acetone is also used and has been shown to produce better histological preservation than frozen sections when employed in the Acetone Methylbenzoate Xylene (AMEX) technique. Protein-denaturing methanol, ethanol and acetone are rarely used alone for fixing blocks unless studying nucleic acids. Acetic acid is a denaturant that is sometimes used in combination with the other precipitating fixatives, such as Davidson's AFA. The alcohols, by themselves, are known to cause considerable shrinkage and hardening of tissue during fixation while acetic acid alone is associated with tissue swelling; combining the two may result in better preservation of tissue morphology.  Oxidizing agents  The oxidizing fixatives can react with the side chains of proteins and other biomolecules, allowing the formation of crosslinks that stabilize tissue structure. However they cause extensive denaturation despite preserving fine cell structure and are used mainly as secondary fixatives. Osmium tetroxide is often used as a secondary fixative when samples are prepared for electron microscopy. (It is not used for light microscopy as it penetrates thick sections of tissue very poorly.) Potassium dichromate, chromic acid, and potassium permanganate all find use in certain specific histological preparations.  Mercurials  Mercurials such as B-5 and Zenker's fixative have an unknown mechanism that increases staining brightness and give excellent nuclear detail. Despite being fast, mercurials penetrate poorly and produce tissue shrinkage. Their best application is for fixation of hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tissues. Also note that since they contain mercury care must be taken with disposal.  Picrates  Picrates penetrate tissue well to react with histones and basic proteins to form crystalline picrates with amino acids and precipitate all proteins. It is a good fixative for connective tissue, preserves glycogen well, and extracts lipids to give superior results to formaldehyde in immunostaining of biogenic and polypeptide hormones However, it causes a loss of basophils unless the specimen is thoroughly washed following fixation.  HOPE fixative  Hepes- glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect (HOPE) gives formalin-like morphology, excellent preservation of protein antigens for immunohistochemistry and enzyme histochemistry, good RNA and DNA yields and absence of crosslinking proteins.  Factors affecting fixation   Acidity or basicity  Should be kept in the physiological range, between pH 4-9. The pH for the ultrastructure preservation should be buffered between 7.2 to 7.4  Osmolarity  Hypertonic solutions give rise to cell shrinkage. Hypotonic solutions result in cell swelling and poor fixation. 10% neutral buffer formalin is 4% formaldehyde (1.33 osmolar) in PBS buffer (0.3 osmolar) sums to 1.63 osmolar. This is a very hypertonic solution yet it has worked well as a general tissue fixation condition for many years in pathology labs. The size of tissue can also affect the fixation process.  Size of the specimen  1–4 mm thickness [0.5 cm]  Volume of the fixative  At least 15-20 times greater than tissue volume  Temperature  Increasing the temperature increases speed of fixation. However, care is required to avoid cooking the specimen. Fixation is routinely carried out at room temperature.  Duration  As a general rule, 1 hour per millimetre of tissue paraformaldehyde (PFA) must penetrate. So if we have a three-dimensional tissue block, it is the shortest dimension that determines fixation time.  Time from removal to fixation  Fixation is a chemical process, and time must be allowed for the process to complete. Although \\"over fixation\\" can be detrimental, under- fixation has recently been appreciated as a significant problem and may be responsible for inappropriate results for some assays.

Around that time, at the age of 20, he already was offered a position by Johns Hopkins University in the United States. He received his Ph.D. degree with van der Woude in Leiden in 1929, writing a dissertation entitled Die kombinatorische Topologie und die Dualitaetssaetze. In 1931 van Kampen took up the position which he had been offered at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and travelled to the United States. There he met Oscar Zariski who had taught at Johns Hopkins University as a Johnston Scholar from 1927 until 1929 when he had joined the Faculty. Zariski had been working on the fundamental group of the complement of an algebraic curve, and he had found generators and relations for the fundamental group but was unable to show that he had found sufficient relations to give a presentation for the group. van Kampen solved the problem, showing that Zariski's relations were sufficient, and the result is now known as the Zariski–van Kampen theorem. This led van Kampen to formulate and prove what is nowadays known as the Seifert–van Kampen theorem. By the late 1930s van Kampen started to suffer from headaches which in 1941 were diagnosed to arise from a tumor originating from a birth mark near his ear. After three surgeries in 1941 and 1942, van Kampen succumbed to cancer and died on 11 February 1942.

The cemetery has been in use for over 260 years. The earliest burials are recorded to have taken place in the 1740s following shortly after the first settlement of this area by Palatine Germans in the middle of the 18th century. These early German graves are noted for their intricately carved headstones and footstones which feature unique German funerary symbolism and in many instances, archaic German text.Veit, Richard F. \\"John Solomon Teetzel and the Anglo-German Gravestone Carving Tradition of 18th Century Northwestern New Jersey\\" in Markers XVII: Annual Journal of the Association for Gravestone Studies.

During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, it was known as the \\"Dutch Meeting House\\". It is presumed that the first structure used by this congregation was a rudimentary church made of logs, dating from as early as 1745 to 1750. Subsequently, a second structure built from local fieldstone was erected 1769-1771. This stone church structure was used by the congregations from 1771 to 1837 when it was abandoned for a Greek Revival frame structure built a quarter mile north from this site. The fieldstone structure was razed in 1847 and according to local tradition the stones from the building's walls were used to construct a stone wall along the cemetery's southern and western perimeter. A stone carved with the year \\"1771\\"--believed to be the original cornerstone for the church--was incorporated into the cemetery's gate. Notable burials Located within the cemetery are several dozen veterans of the French & Indian War, American Revolution, War of 1812, and American Civil War. *Casper Shafer (1712-1784), early pioneer, miller, member of Provincial Congress of New Jersey and New Jersey General Assembly (1776-1779) *Maureen Gearhardt (d. 1972), former early 20th-century Coca-Cola girl *John George Wintermute (1711-1782), early pioneer of StillwaterWintermute, Jacob Perry.

It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on November April 16, 1864 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. The principal Dancers were Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa as the Prima Ballerina, and Timofei Stukolkin as Rinaldo. A variation from this ballet--composed by Petipa in 1905 for the Prima Ballerina Olga Preobrajenskaya--was the last choreography Petipa ever created (as noted in his Diaries). Lev Ivanov produced a revival for the Imperial Ballet, with the composer/conductor Riccardo Drigo editing and making additions to Cesare Pugni's original score.

Proclaimed by some of his followers to be the Messiah, Abu Isa himself never made such claims or inferences. He seems to have allied himself with Sunbadh after the assassination of Abu Muslim in 755 CE. His forces fought Caliph al-Mansur's army at Rayy only to be defeated. Abu Isa fell in this battle. Dating issues The dating of Abu Isa's career has been disputed since the Middle Ages. The two main sources for information of him are Qirqisani, a Jewish Karaite historian; and Shahrastani, who wrote an extensive guide to Jewish sects over the ages. Qirqisani places the events in the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (685 - 705 CE) while Shahrastani says it began under the reign of Marwan II (744 - 750) on through to Al-Mansur (d. 775). Qirqisani's dates place Abu Isa's uprising during Umayyad clashes with the Byzantines which would coincide with Messianic stories of the battle between Gog and Magog and place it early enough to influence Karaism; Shahrastani's would put the revolt at the end of the Umayyad Dynasty and thus at a pivotal point of upheaval in the Muslim world.Israel Friedlaender Shiitic Elements in Jewish Sectarianism Jewish Quarterly Review Oct 1910Steven Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew Princeton University Press 1995 Both are plausible and there is no direct Isawite documentation. The Turkish scholar Halil Ibrahim Bulut in 2004 has shown that Shahrastani's 'Abbasid date is more likely.Halil Ibrahim Bulut, \\"ISEVIYYE (Islam Dunyasinda Ortaya Cikan Ilk Yahudi Mezhebi)\\", Ekev Academic Review, 8.18 (Jan. 2004) 297-318 Beliefs Abu Isa believed that he was the last of five heralds from God announcing the imminent arrival of the messiah. Never did he claim to be the Messiah himself, but some of his followers felt that he would return after his death and bring the End Times. He made some minor alterations to the general set of Rabbinic laws and his followers became ascetic in their manners. The most radical of the Isawite beliefs was the acceptance of both Jesus and Muhammad as true prophets, but only to their own peoples. *Other alterations included: **Banning of the consumption of wine and meat at certain times; **Sunnah prayers to 7 or 10 depending on the sourceIsrael Friedlaender Shiitic Elements in Jewish Sectarianism Jewish Quarterly Review Oct 1912 (in addition to the standard 3); **Affirmation of the Shammai stance on divorce; **Belief that Alnabi is a collection of Hakhams;Bulut, 301-2 The ban on meat is actually a Talmudic reference to not eating meat in exile, while the additional prayers are usually explained by noting Psalm 119:164. Miracles Two major miracles are attributed to Abu Isa. The first stems from his writings, as he was known to his followers as nothing but an illiterate tailor before he was touched with prophecy. He is said to have thus produced the works that outline the beliefs above and herald the coming of the Messianic age. The other is during the revolt itself when he defended his followers from the Caliphate's forces behind a line drawn on the ground with a myrtle branch, at which point he rode out and singlehandedly defeated the first assault by the Muslims. Possible connection to Shi'ism The arrival of Abu Isa comes at an interesting point in the history of the Jews and the Muslims. Regardless of the which dates are true, each could be seen as during the rise of the radical Shi'a movements in Islam. With the center of these movements being Iraq and later Persia, it should come as no surprise that the other ahl al-kitab or \\"People of the Book\\" might be influenced. Some Jews actually saw the coming of the Arabs as the apocalypse that would usher in the new age, but there are distinctive influences that can be noted in this movement from Shi'ism. The idea of the illiterate prophet is equated with the story of Muhammad and his receiving of the Qur'an while the idea of a chain of prophets is notably similar to the Imams and the foreseen coming of the Mahdi. Scholars disagree to what degree Shi'ism affected Abu Isa or whether Shi'ism was at the same time developing and incorporating Jewish elements However, issues with this include that Shi'a reject the belief Muhammad was unlettered, Imams are infallible, that Shi'ism did not expect the immediate return of al-Mahdi, and that Iraq and Iran were not primarily Shi'a until a few centuries ago.

Its main auxiliary route is U.S. Route 24 and is within two miles of Coatsburg, another rural community. During the early 1900s the village was famous for its pickle production and was often nicknamed \\"Pickleville\\" because of the vast pickle farms. Paloma is part of the Quincy, IL-MO Micropolitan Statistical Area.  Geography  Paloma is located at (40.022778°, -91.195278°). According to the United States Census Bureau, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) 62359 includes and surrounds the community.  Demographics  For the 62359 ZCTA in the 2000 census, which includes Paloma, there were 192 people, 76 households, and 63 families residing in the area.  History  The community was once known as Pickleville. Local producers shipped pickles to Quincy off a rail platform about a mile west of the present Paloma. Paloma was founded in 1839 when Godding settled here and the cemetery started. Daniel Gooding, an early settler, offered to build the railroad a depot and platform if it would move the Pickleville platform to the town he platted on his land. The railroad agreed, Gooding built the depot and a railroad conductor's wife was responsible for changing the name of the community, deciding Pickleville wasn't very fitting. She named it after a small tribe of Indians, the Paloma, a term which is also Spanish for dove. The community thrived thanks to the railroad. At one point, the town had two gas stations, a general store, bank, lumberyard, an elevator, a bulk plant and busy Saturday nights when farmers came into town to trade for their groceries. Euterpe Hall, named for a Greek muse, was the site of plays and shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eventually moving to nearby Fowler and then closing. U.S. Route 24 came through in 1923-24, signaling the rise of the importance of the automobile and the decline of Paloma. The Elevator located in the center of the town once served the many pickles produced and still serves the home of local crops. Today even though pickles are no longer grown, the Elevator remains a county landmark. A sesquicentennial celebration took place August 24–26, 2007, in Paloma, with events tied to the 50th annual Paloma Fiesta.Paloma annual fiesta to include celebration of 150 years Accessed 30 August 2007.

Written primarily by George Mason, the resolutions rejected the British Parliament's claim of supreme authority over the American colonies. More than thirty counties in Virginia passed similar resolutions in 1774, \\"but the Fairfax Resolves were the most detailed, the most influential, and the most radical.\\"Broadwater, George Mason, 67. Background and drafting After Parliament passed the Coercive Acts, also known as the Intolerable Acts, to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party, the Virginia House of Burgesses proclaimed that June 1, 1774, would be a day of \\"fasting, humiliation, and prayer\\" as a show of solidarity with Boston. In response, Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, dissolved the House of Burgesses. The burgesses reconvened at the Raleigh Tavern on May 27 and called for Virginia's counties to elect delegates to a special convention to meet in August. George Washington and Charles Broadwater were elected as Fairfax County's representatives to the convention. On July 5, 1774, Washington and others from Fairfax County met in Alexandria, Virginia, to appoint a committee to draft a statement that would, as Washington described it, \\"define our Constitutional Rights.\\"Broadwater, George Mason, 65. The statement would also formally serve as instructions to Fairfax County's delegates to the Virginia Convention.Broadwater, George Mason, 66. The committee wrote a draft that was, in all likelihood, primarily the work of George Mason. Mason and Washington met at Washington's Mount Vernon home on July 17, and perhaps revised the resolutions. The following day in Alexandria, the Fairfax Resolves were endorsed in a meeting of freeholders chaired by Washington. Text summary and effect In the Resolves, the freeholders expressed a desire to remain subjects of the British Empire, but they insisted that \\"we will use every means which Heaven hath given us to prevent our becoming its slaves.\\" The short document provided the following: * a concise summary of American constitutional concerns on such issues as taxation, representation, judicial power, military matters and the colonial economy * a proposal for the creation of a nonimportation effort to be levied against British goods * a call for a general congress of the colonies to convene for the purpose of preserving the Americans' rights as Englishmen * a condemnation of the practice of importing slaves as a \\"wicked, cruel, and unnatural trade\\"; its termination was urged The Resolves directed Washington and Broadwater to present the resolutions to the Virginia Convention. The Fairfax Resolves, like the many other similar resolutions passed in county meetings throughout the colonies, summarized the feelings of many colonists in mid-1774 — a conviction that their constitutional rights were being violated by British policies. The Resolves also marked a step forward in inter-colonial cooperation as more Americans began to realize that a threat against one colony was a threat against all. Finally, political rivalries in Virginia were muted to some degree, allowing such figures as Washington and Mason to work productively with the more radical Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee and others. The non-importation protest called for in the Resolves influenced, with some modifications, the Virginia Association, which in turn provided the pattern for the Continental Association.Ammerman, Common Cause, 86.

The first was at the time of the 2002 WC in South Korea and Japan while the second happened during the 2006 WC in Germany. The site had a multi-national outlook and believed that inter-cultural communication and ethnic reconciliation throughout all aspects of society (including sports) should be a future goal for Balkan countries. The main idea of JS and its founder, Alexander Damir Yovanovich (Serbian (Latin): Aleksandar Damir Jovanović - Serbian (Cyrillic): Александар Дамир Јовановић), was to promote and write about sports, mainly football, regarding countries made out the fall of Yugoslavia and their athletes. Yovanovich believed that the way to reconciliation of Ex-Yugoslav Nations is through sports and friendship based on mutual respect of each other's differences but also similarities. JadranSport was imagined as one of the engines in this process. Another main character in JS glossary and who also deserves to be credited with JadranSport's greatest moments is Dejan Nikolic (Serbian (Latin): Dejan Nikolić - Serbian (Cyrillic): Дејан Николић)who together with Yovanovich brought JS on a professional level and ensured funding for this project to become the main source of sport news for Former Yugoslav diaspora by 2002.  Humble Beginnings  Yovanovich started JadranSport as an online project in 1998 as a sole contributor and was writing the news he collected through various sources. At the time, the website was based on a free server Homestead and was more of a blog than an actual professional online sport magazine. Despite this, Yovanovich implemented novelties that made the website interesting mainly to Former Yugoslav diaspora. He was most likely the first person in Former Yugoslavia to broadcast games through Live Text coverage online and he was a firm supporter of giving opinionated news rather than agency-like content. Shortly after, he met up with Nikolic who wished to collaborate, and as one thing led to another, they decided that JadranSport will go Professional.  Golden Era & Collapse  Led by Yovanovich – Nikolic editorial team, JadranSport's rating was on a high rise between 2000 and 2002. At its peak, JS employed more than fifteen correspondents and columnists and five full-time journalists plus two copy-editors. The result was unique style of writing, production of approximately forty articles, stories and interviews a day with high level of attention given to athletes abroad and support to regional leagues. As JadranSport was mainly financed from private funds, in 2002. JS decided to collaborate with an outside financier in order to achieve its goal of making the first virtual Encyclopedia regarding World Cups in football. Everything started well, however shortly after, the finances were mainly directed towards the Virtual Encyclopedia rather than to the Online Magazine itself and the structure of JS was soon divided between the core of JS and the financier. After a long struggle, mentally and financial exhausted, JS crew headed by their editors Yovanovich and Nikolic decided to “slow down” and put the project on hold until better times. A lot of fan mail was received calling for JS to be brought back online, even donations were offered by the most dedicated readers, however the JS band parted and started walking their own paths. Yovanovich continued working for mostly English and South American media, including football clubs / agent agencies as a scout and collaborating with sport writers throughout the world including The FIFA Centennial Book author Pr. Peirre Lanfranchi and David Goldblatt the author of The Ball Is Round and many other football books. On the other side, Nikolic became an Editor in Chief of a E-Magazine from Belgrade, dealing mostly with business and economy issues.  Post-Offline Period  Two years after JadranSport went offline, a Slovenian-based web programmer and developer agency director Saso Petrov managed to convince Yovanovich in re-opening the JadranSport Files. Encouraged by Petrov and some of his former associates, Yovanovich took on a challenge to revive the JS project. This time, the Online Magazine was presented in English. The rating of JS was slowly rising due to lack of promotion, however the quality of content was in place. Some of the main contributors during this time, apart from Yovanovich himself, were also Igor Krstic, Saša Jovanović, Erik Bickford and many others. By December 2005. JadranSport started recovering piece by piece, even managing to start a collaboration with Walter Zenga and convincing the former No. 1 World goalkeeper to become a columnist and talks about a possible sponsorship deal with Lotto were opened. However, shortly after, the entire project fell gradually under the ice as Yovanovich moved to Canada due to personal reasons.

It most commonly indicates the campaign or operation the recipient received the award for, and multiple bars on the same medal are used to indicate that the recipient has met the criteria for receiving the medal in multiple theatres. When used in conjunction with decorations for exceptional service, such as gallantry medals, the term \\"and bar\\" means that the award has been bestowed multiple times. In the example, \\"Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, VC, OM, DSO and two bars, DFC\\", \\"DSO and two bars\\" means that the Distinguished Service Order was awarded on three occasions. A British convention is to indicate bars by the use of asterisks; thus, DSO** would denote a DSO and two bars. Bars are also used on long- service medals to indicate the length of service rendered. The two terms are used because terms \\"bar\\" and \\"clasp\\" both refer to two parts of the medal; the indicator discussed in this article, and the part of the medal connected to the ribbon. History Prior to the early 19th century, medals and decorations were only awarded to ranking officers; occasions existed where medals were presented to soldiers (other ranks or enlisted men) or seamen (naval ratings), but these were often private efforts. One exception was the Army Gold Medal issued to higher ranking participants in the Peninsular War. A medal was given for service, with a clasp for each battle fought. After four clasps were earned the medal was turned in for a cross with the battle names on the arms, and additional clasps were then added. The maximum was achieved by the Duke of Wellington, with a cross and nine clasps. Over the next 40 years, it became customary for governments to present a medal to all soldiers and officers involved in a campaign. These medals were often engraved with the names of the major battles the recipient had fought in during the campaign. The main disadvantages of this system were that new medals had to be created for each campaign or war, and that it was impossible to tell at a glance if the recipient was only a participant in the campaign overall, or if he had been involved in one or several major actions. (The first gallantry medal to be awarded to ordinary British soldiers was the Victoria Cross in 1856.) The Sutlej Medal was the earliest medal to use such bars. It was awarded to British Army and Honourable East India Company soldiers who fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War between 1845 and 1846. The first battle the recipient participated in would be engraved on the medal itself. If the recipient had participated in multiple engagements, silver bars bearing the name of each additional battle were attached to the medal's ribbon. This method of notation evolved again on the Punjab Campaign medal, where the standard medal was awarded to all that had served during the campaign, with bars produced for the three major battles; the Battle of Chillianwala, the Siege of Multan, and the Battle of Gujarat. The creation of bars led to the development of 'General Service' medals, which would be presented to any soldier serving in a general region or time frame. Bars would be awarded to denote the particular campaign or war the recipient fought in. The 1854 India General Service Medal was awarded to soldiers over a 41-year period. Twenty-three clasps were created for this award, becoming one of the more extreme uses of this system. The British Naval General Service Medal, was authorised in 1847 with some 231 clasps (of which about 10 were never issued) for actions ranging from relatively minor skirmishes to certain campaigns and all full-fledged battles between 1793 and 1840. The Crimea Medal was issued with ornate battle bars. Since then the general trend has been to have simple horizontal devices. Types of bar Illustration of the three versions of the Wintered Over Device from the United States Antarctica Service Medal * Campaign bars or battle bars are used to denote the particular campaign, battle, or region the recipient operated in to receive the award. This is the most common use of medal bars on military decorations. In the United Kingdom, campaign bars are usually known as clasps and when the ribbon alone is worn they are sometimes indicated by rosettes, although this is not commonly authorised. Examples of ones that were issued are the \\"under enemy fire\\" clasp on the 1914 Star and the Battle of Britain clasp on the 1939-45 Star. In the United States Military, Service stars are used to indicate participation in multiple battles or campaigns, although the World War I Victory Medal had an extensive system of bars. Starting with World War II the Arrowhead device was authorized for assault landings. Also in this conflict a unique variation of the Service star was the Wake Island Device, a \\"W\\" placed on the ribbons of the Navy and Marine Corps Expeditionary Medals. This was issued to represent the medal bar for fighting in the Battle of Wake Island. * Achievement bars are used to indicate a particular or additional feat associated with the medal. As an example, the Wintered Over Device attached to the United States Antarctica Service Medal indicates that the recipient performed a tour of duty during the Antarctic winter. * Service bars indicate the length of service a person has provided to the organisation presenting the award. This type of bar is most commonly found on long service medals for the military and emergency services. * Multiple award bars display the number of times a decoration for merit or distinguished service has been awarded. In the United States, Oak Leaf Clusters (Army and Air Force) and Stars (Navy and Marine Corps), rather than bars, are issued for receiving the same award multiple times. In the United Kingdom, each bar is indicated by a rosette when the ribbon alone is worn (or, in the case of the Victoria Cross or George Cross, by an additional miniature model of the cross itself, since one of these is always worn on the ribbon of these two awards).

He was operational throughout the greater Wide Bay area and was eventually apprehended by members of the public outside the town of Gin Gin, Queensland. Early life The eldest of eight children, McPherson was born in Inverness-shire, Scotland, in 1842, to John, a farmer, and Elspeth, his wife. When McPherson was twelve, his family migrated to Australia aboard the William Miles. After arriving at Moreton Bay on 19 January 1855, John McPherson found work as a farm labourer, while James began school at Ipswich, where he displayed a skill for languages, becoming fluent in French and German. After finishing his schooling, McPherson first started work at a stoneyard on the corner of Wharf and Queen streets in Ipswich, owned by a Mr. Petrie, before finding work on a cattle station. On the station he began 'tailing' cattle (keeping them near the head station at mustering time) and bought a revolver to practice shooting with in his spare time. Bushranging N.S.W. Police officer Sir Frederick Pottinger who wounded MacPherson in 1864 but failed to capture him. Nanango mail carrier Patrick McCallum who was robbed by McPherson in 1866. On 4 March 1864, MacPherson was part of a group of three who 'stuck up' the public house of Richard Willis at Houghton River, wounding Willis, and stealing 'three cabbage tree hats, two pairs of riding pants, one pair of boots, one gun, one crimean shirt, one bottle of whisky, and fourteen pounds of flour'. Following the robbery, the government offered a £50 reward for the culprit's apprehension, and MacPherson left Queensland for New South Wales, with the aim of joining up with a bushranging gang, that included Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner, John Gilbert and John Dunn. MacPherson is said to have committed highway robberies on his way to find the gang, and to have combined his father's given and mother's maiden name to create the alias John Bruce. Other aliases included Mar, Kerr, Scotia and Scotchie. On 17 August 1864, MacPherson was almost apprehended by Sir Frederick Pottinger, a New South Wales Police officer, who had earlier pursued Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner, with mixed success. Pottinger later told Police in Brisbane that he encountered MacPherson, who was on foot, and they exchanged fire, both receiving arm wounds, before MacPherson escaped. Based on information received from Pottinger, a police patrol from Forbes, led by Sgt Condell and accompanied by an Aboriginal tracker, captured MacPherson on 28 February 1865 on the Billabong Creek northwest of Forbes. He was described as 'about five feet nine inches in height, has light hair, blue eyes, florid compaction, and altogether not a forbidding sort of a look about him' with a mark on his arm where Pottinger had wounded him. McPherson was taken to Forbes, and then Sydney, where he was to face trial for shooting at Pottinger, but before the trial could begin Pottinger fatally shot himself, either accidentally, or as an act of suicide, and, in April 1865, the charge was withdrawn. MacPherson was still wanted over the Willis public house robbery and was to be returned aboard a coastal steamer, but managed to escape from the custody of the Police constable who was escorting him. He began to rob the mail coaches around Maryborough, Gayndah and Gladstone. In early 1866, MacPherson twice held up the mail delivery between Ipswich and Nanango. Once, while he was on foot, leading him to steal the postman's horse, as well as the mail. The second time he sent £1700 worth of cheques and money orders to the Governor of Queensland Sir George Bowen with a note explaining that he had no need for them. The government raised the reward for his capture to £250. Capture and trials McPherson was eventually captured, not by the police, but members of the public. On 30 March 1866, at Monduran Station near Gin Gin, owned by William Henry Walsh, two station workers, Dougie, and Walsh's nephew Jack, told the station supervisor, William Nott, that they thought they had seen McPherson as they returned from Gin Gin. The three, and another man called 'Currie', formed an armed party and they found McPherson about six miles away. Nott called on McPherson to stand down but they were forced to give chase until Nott threatened to shoot. McPherson dropped his gun, saying, 'I give myself up', adding, 'I knew you were not the police by the pace at which you followed me down that ridge'. They returned McPherson to the station, for the night, and then into the custody of the Police at Gin Gin. McPherson was taken to the court-house at Maryborough where spectators told the Maryborough Chronicle that they were disappointed with his appearance as he wasn't 'flash' or 'ferocious looking'. He was then remanded to the Brisbane for a Supreme Court trial over the Willis public house robbery, but was found not guilty. He was then returned to Maryborough, to appear, on 13 September 1866, on charges related to robbing the local mails. McPherson was found guilty and given two twenty-five-year sentences, to be served concurrently, at St Helena Island, Moreton Bay. The presiding Judge noting that the sentence was heavier than would usually have been given for such crimes but he intended for it to have a deterrent effect. Later life 1914 view of the stockade at St Helena Island. McPherson started his escape attempt from here in 1870. McPherson entered St Helena on 14 September 1866, and, on 11 April 1870, was shot in the wrist and apprehended, with six others, who had freed themselves from the stockade and where hiding in the scrub before they attempted to escape from the island. In 1874, a petition to request clemency for McPherson, organised by the Rev. B. G. Wilson, and signed by members of the Queensland parliament, was successful in securing his release on 22 December. McPherson found work as a stockman at Cressbrook, and later, as an outstation overseer. Another outstation manager at the time was Sylvester Browne, brother of Thomas Alexander Browne, author of the 1882 bushranger novel Robbery Under Arms, leading to suggestion that McPherson's exploits may have been adapted for the plot. In 1878, at a private residence in Blackall, McPherson married Elizabeth Annie Hausfeldt, from Isisford. They went on to have 4 sons and 2 daughters. He died, aged 53, on 23 August 1895 at Burketown, after falling from a horse. Legacy Each year, on the third weekend of March, Gin Gin holds a Wild Scotsman Festival, named for McPherson and his 1866 arrest.

President George Washington declared Thursday, November 26, 1789 as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer. Background Setting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards\\"Thanksgiving\\". The Teachers Page. Library of Congress.

Thanksgiving services were routine in what became the Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607,Morill, Ann \\"Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals\\" Infobase Publishing, p.33 with the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia holding a thanksgiving in 1610. In 1619, the Berkeley Hundred colony held a service on December 4, 1619, to celebrate \\"the day of our ship's arrival\\" and proclaimed the date would be \\"yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to the Almighty God.\\" The colony was wiped out shortly after, in March 1622, with some inhabitants being massacred, and the rest fleeing. The generally referenced 'First Thanksgiving' occurred on Plymouth Colony, shortly after the colonists first successful harvest in autumn of 1621. They celebrated for three straight days with their Native American neighbors with whom they had signed a mutual protection treaty the Spring before. In 1723, Massachusetts Bay Governor William Dummer proclaimed a day of thanksgiving on November 6. The first proclamation in the independent United States was issued by John Hancock as President of the Continental Congress as a day of fasting on March 16, 1776. The first national Thanksgiving was celebrated on December 18, 1777, and the Continental Congress issued National Thanksgiving Day proclamations each year between 1778 and 1784. There were no national thanksgiving day proclamations from 1785 to 1788. The First Presidential National Day of Thanksgiving In Congress, Elias Boudinot introduced a resolution to create a joint committee to \\"wait on the President of the United States, to request that he would recommend to the people a day of public prayer and thanksgiving,\\" The resolution was opposed by Anti-Federalists, who opposed increased power of the central government. Chief among the opposition were Aedanus Burke, and Thomas Tudor Tucker. Burke was of the opinion that the holiday was too \\"European.\\" He \\"did not like this mimicking of European customs, where they made a mere mockery of thanksgivings.\\" Burke was referencing the fact that at thanksgivings, both sides of a war often sang Te Deum, a hymn of praise. He was objecting that both the winners and losers in a war gave thanksgiving. Tucker however, felt that the federal government did not have the power to propose a day of thanksgiving. He was of the opinion that \\"If a day of thanksgiving must take place, let it be done by the authority of the States.\\" Tucker also worried about the separation of church and state, as in his opinion, proclaiming a day of thanksgiving was a religious matter. In the end, the resolution passed the House and the Senate, and a committee of Elias Boudinot, Roger Sherman, Peter Silvester, William Samuel Johnson, and Ralph Izard delivered the message to Washington on or before September 28, 1789. President Washington noted that \\"both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested [him] 'to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.'\\" It was formally declared on November 26 to \\"be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.\\" President George Washington made this proclamation on October 3, 1789 in New York City.\\"Rediscovering George Washington\\" PBS On the day of thanksgiving, Washington attended services at St. Paul's Chapel in New York City, and donated beer and food to imprisoned debtors in the city.  Text  Aftermath George Washington proclaimed a second day of Thanksgiving in 1795, following the defeat of the Whiskey Rebellion. After Washington left office, John Adams, James Madison, and others intermediately declared days of Thanksgiving. Several presidents opposed days of national thanksgiving, with Thomas Jefferson openly denouncing such a proclamation. By 1855, 16 states celebrated Thanksgiving (14 on the fourth Thursday of November, and two on the third). However, it was not until 1863 that Abraham Lincoln established the regular tradition of observing days of national thanksgiving.

While uranium-series dating of ox teeth from the same site in 1994 obtained a date of , Uranium series dating of ox teeth from the site obtained a date of . it is unclear whether the hominid cranium and the ox teeth date from a similar era.P.

Access to Dali Man is restricted. The cranium is currently housed in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China.  Characteristics of the skull  The Dali cranium is interesting to modern anthropologists as it is possibly a well-preserved example of archaic Homo sapiens; it has a mixture of traits from Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.Wu X. (1981): A well-preserved cranium of an archaic type of early Homo sapiens from Dali, China. Scientia Sinica no 24: pp 530-539 The details of the face and skull are however distinct from European Neanderthals and earlier European hominids, such as remains found in Petralona cave and Atapuerca. Vault The skull is low and long, though the posterior end of the skull is rounded, unlike the contemporary broad-based H. erectus or top-wide skull of modern humans. It does however bear a prominent sagittal keel, a trait found in H. erectus but in few modern humans. The brain appears to have been sitting mainly behind the face, giving an extremely low forehead. The cranial capacity is estimated to around 1 120 cc, at the lower end of the modern human range, and upper end of the H. erectus range. The base of the cranium is less robust than in H. erectus.Wu R. (1988): The reconstruction of the fossil human skull from Jinniushan, Yinkou, Liaoning Province and its main features. Acta Anthropologica Sinica no 7: pp 97–101. The posterior margin lacks the heavy neck muscle attachment seen in that group. Unlike the distinct tubular form seen in H. erectus, the tympanic plate is thin and foreshortened, a condition similar to that of modern humans.Etler, D.A. (2001). Picture Gallery of Fossil Hominoids and Hominids from China , from the Center for Study of Chinese Prehistory. Unlike H. erectus skulls, the Dali skull lacks the \\"pinched\\" look between the face and the cranial vault. Face The face is topped by massive brow ridges. The ridges curve over each eye, unlike the straight bar-like ridges seen at the Peking man material from Zhoukoudian. The curvature is more similar structurally to the brow ridges in archaic humans from Europe and Africa. The cheek bones are delicate, and the nasal bone flattened, again a curious combination of traits. During fossilization, the upper jaw has been fractured and dislocated upwards, giving the cranium the appearance of having a very short face. If reconstructed, the face would be probably be similar in overall dimensions to that of the Jinniushan man skull. Interpretation There has been considerable debate regarding how to classify the fossil in terms of species, with some anthropologists insisting it to be a regional variant of Homo heidelbergensis and others categorizing it as an early representative of Homo sapiens, and as such there is no current consensus on the species status of the Dali fossil.Jurmain, Robert, Lynn Kilgore, Wenda Trevathan, Essentials of Physical Anthropology, Sixth Edition (Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006): 252-253. Some anthropologists, notably many Chinese representatives, cite the characteristics of the Dali cranium and other similar Chinese fossils of that era as evidence for genetic continuity in modern H. sapiens today, arguing that Dali's traits are commonly found in modern Chinese H. sapiens populations. In turn, it was argued that modern Chinese humans did not evolve in Africa, but instead evolved in China from a separate lineage of H. erectus.Wolpoff M.H., Wu X., & Thorne A.G. (1984): Modern Homo sapiens origins: a general theory of human evolution involving the fossil evidence from east Asia. In FH Smith and F Spencer (eds.): The origins of modern humans: a world survey of the fossil evidence. New York: Alan R. Liss, pp. 411-483. This position is consistent with the \\"Multiregional hypothesis,\\" which states that different human populations across the planet had evolved with current racial characteristics in separate environments, and is contrary to the popular \\"Recent single-origin hypothesis,\\" which asserts that modern H. sapiens evolved solely in Africa and spread throughout the planet during a recent exodus. It has also been suggested that Dali man, if determined to belong to Homo sapiens, may represent an earlier expansion of archaic H. sapiens out of Africa predating the later more successful expansion ancestral to modern non-African populations.https://sciencetrends.com/ancient-skull- found-china-change-history-humans/ Professor and DNA specialist, Jin Li, of the Research Center of Contemporary Anthropology at Shanghai Fudan University (RCCASFU) claims he has proved modern China's African ancestry based on DNA testing techniques. In 1998, Chinese scientist Chu Jiayou concluded through analyzing DNA microsatellites of Han Chinese and Chinese ethnic minorities that the ancestors had migrated to China from Africa via South Asia.http://www.china.org.cn/china/2009-11/24/content_18944317.htm Africans are the most genetically diverse peoples of the Earth, specifically Sub- Saharan Africa,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/374.abstract?casa_token=4J2R28EgfRAAAAAA:baPKEVhIUK1iuHj2NuSc80htb1b8uhN12gYTQwmTPjpFsCKPWTX25ln6g254ZIUTaFvvTgtchVjXEoA and have more genetic variation within the continent than the rest of the world combined.

International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, vol. 14, Issue 6, pp 419-447 summary The Denisova hominin, represented by a very robust finger bone found in the Altai mountains in Russia is quoted as likely linked to the Dali people. DNA studies show the bone belong to a woman, with Mitochondrial DNA linking it to a very deep split in the human tree, at around 1 million years old. This would make the DNA erectus rather than heidelbergensis or other more recent splits. However, the analysis of the nuclear DNA points to a sister group relationship with the neanderthals. Thus, it is possible that the archaic humans in Asia were a mixture of a Neandertal relatives and an already widespread Asian Erectus population.

The bacterium is a thermophile and is widely distributed in soil, hot springs, ocean sediment, and is a cause of spoilage in food products. It will grow within a temperature range of 30 to 75°C. Some strains are capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide aerobically. It is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. The biological indicator contains spores of the organism on filter paper inside a vial. After sterilizing, the cap is closed, an ampule of growth medium inside of the vial is crushed and the whole vial is incubated. A color and/or turbidity change indicates the results of the sterilization process; no change indicates that the sterilization conditions were achieved, otherwise the growth of the spores indicates that the sterilization process has not been met. Recently a fluorescent-tagged strain, Rapid Readout(tm), is being used for verifying sterilization, since the visible blue fluorescence appears in about one-tenth the time needed for pH- indicator color change, and an inexpensive light sensor can detect the growing colonies. Biological indicators are used in conjunction with chemical indicators and process indicators to validate sterilization processes. It was first described in 1920 as Bacillus stearothermophilus,DONK P.J.: A highly resistant thermophilic organism\\" Journal of Bacteriology 1920; 5, 373-374. but, together with Bacillus thermoglucosidasius, it was reclassified as a member of the genus Geobacillus in 2001.  Applications in molecular biology   DNA Polymerase  Recently, a DNA polymerase derived from these bacteria, Bst polymerase, has become important in molecular biology applications. Bst polymerase has a helicase-like activity, making it able to unwind DNA strands. Its optimum functional temperature is between 60 and 65°C and it is denatured at temperatures above 70°C. These features make it useful in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but does not require the high temperature (96°C) step required to denature DNA.  Reverse transcriptase  In 2013, a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase (TGIRT), GsI-IIC-MRF, from G. stearothermophilus was found to retain activity up to 70°C and to exhibit high processivity and a low error rate. These properties make this enzyme useful for reverse transcribing long and/or highly structured RNA molecules. A method for determining RNA secondary structure, DMS-MaPseq, uses this enzyme because it converts normal RNA to DNA accurately but introduces mutations at unpaired bases that have been methylated by dimethyl sulfate, and the mutations can be identified via sequencing.

These were the earliest of brachiopods, ranging from the Cambrian into the Holocene. They rapidly diversified during the Cambrian into the Ordovician, but most families became extinct by the end of the Devonian. The articulation in these brachiopods is lacking. These brachiopods have adductor and oblique muscles, but no diductor muscles. The anus is located at the side of the body. The pedicle is a hollow extension of the ventral body wall. Posterior body wall separates dorsal and ventral mantles. The shells are usually made up of apatite (calcium phosphate), however rare cases have calcite or aragonite shells.
