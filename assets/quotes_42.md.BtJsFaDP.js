Yarkhushta (, ) is an Armenian folk and martial dance associated with the highlands of the historical region of Sassoun in Western Armenia. Yarkhushta belongs to a wider category of Armenian \\"clap dances\\" (’Æ’°÷É-’∫’°÷Ä’•÷Ä, tsap parer). The dance is performed by men, who face each other in pairs. The key element of the dance is a forward movement when participants rapidly approach one another and vigorously clap onto the palms of hands of dancers in the opposite row. History and tradition Yarkhushta is believed to have its origins in the early Middle Ages as it is mentioned in the works of Movses Khorenatsi, Faustus of Byzantium, and Grigor Magistros. Yarkhushta has traditionally been danced by Armenian soldiers before combat engagements, partly for ritualistic purposes, and partly in order to cast off fear and boost battle spirit for more effective hand-to-hand combat. Diana Der-Hovanessian. The Circle Dancers. 1996  Euphorigenic effect  The tune of the dance is played intentionally very loudly by two zurna or p'ku () hornpipes and one or more double-headed bass drums, each struck with a mallet and a stick from opposite sides of the drum's cylinder. It has been demonstrated that the combination of hornpipe's high-frequency tone and the bass drums' deep, low-frequency beat create a combination of sounds with wide peak-to-peak amplitude that is capable of placing the dancers in the state of euphoric trance. This factor amplifies the effect of adrenaline/epinephrine rush that the dancing of yarkhushta usually produces.Irina Petrosian. Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore. 2006, p. 19 Modern revival In modern-day Armenia, yarkhushta is popular in settlements populated by resettlers from Sassoun, especially in villages around the towns of Talin, Aparan, and Ashtarak. The dance was popularized in the late 1930s by Srbuhi Lisitsian who taught at the Yerevan Dance College. In 1957, the dance underwent further choreographic refinement by folk culture enthusiast Vahram Aristakesian and performed by folk dance troupe from the village of Ashnak.Antranig Armenian Dance Ensemble - Reflections - 40th Anniversary Celebration & Performance - Souvenir Program, November 28, 2009. p. 46, Publisher: Alice Tully hall, Lincoln Center; First Edition (2009) The dance was revived in the 1980s by the folk group Maratuk and, later, by the folk ensemble Karin. There are attempts to introduce yarkhushta into curriculum of dances and songs of the Armenian Army. There are several poems and samples of visual art that touch on the theme of yarkhushta. Among them is the poem \\"Dance of Sassoun\\" (¬´’ç’°’Ω’∏÷Ç’∂÷Å’´’∂’•÷Ä’´ ’∫’°÷Ä’®¬ª) by Gevorg Emin published in 1975.

Early life  Paspali was born in 1926 in Vlor√´. When he was still very young, he had to leave school because of economic hardship during the Italian occupation of Albania, but he earned his living by selling goods to the Italian soldiers. During 1943 he joined the Albanian army in order to fight for his country's freedom. At the end of 1944 he joined one of the amateur bands of his division. Soon after, he moved to Durr√´s, where he began working as a driver in the port, but continued to perform with amateur groups. His talent was appreciated by local composer Pjet√´r Dungu, who invited him to become a soloist in the choir of the local cultural center.Rilindja Demokratike, Kristaq Paspali interview, 1 August 1999  Career  In the years 1950 to 1954 he studied at the Jordan Misja High School in Tirana under the direction of singer Marie Kraja. He had stated that it had been difficult for him to combine school and having to provide for his family, but his hard working wife Kalliroi helped him do it. After that, he began performing in the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania as their main tenor. In 1958 he went to study music in Moscow. He was the first Albanian soloist, who starred in the famous Bolshoi Theatre. He sang, among others, in Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. Despite his success in Moscow, his return to Tirana was unspectacular. The relations between Russia and Albania had started to deteriorate, and the fact that, despite him singing Albanian songs in the Bolshoi, he also sang in Italian, was frowned upon by the Albanian government. For 2 years his salary decreased significantly and he was made to clean the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania. However, the Albanian people collected a large amount of signatures in order to get him back on stage, in which they succeeded.Gazeta Shqiptare, Kristaq Paspali interview, 6 September 1997 Throughout his career, he performed 23 roles in operas such as Carmen, La traviata, and Tosca, as well as Prenk√´ Jakova's operas Mrika and Sk√´nderbeu He retired in 1976; however, in 1991, he emigrated with his family to Athens where he won the competition for the Greek National Opera soloist.

Atkinson is best known for creating the Beamish Museum near Stanley, County Durham, an open-air 'living' museum on the history of the north of England with a focus on the changes brought to both urban and rural life by the industrialisation of the early 20th century. Early life Atkinson was born in Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire on 13 April 1924, the oldest son of Ernest, a labourer, and Elfrida, a school teacher and later headmistress. An early interest in fossil collecting later saw him become the youngest member of the Barnsley Naturalist and Scientific Society. He was educated at nearby Mapplewell School and at Barnsley grammar school. During the Second World War he obtained a science degree from the University of Sheffield, whilst also serving as a volunteer with the paratroops. Career Atkinson began his working life at a coking plant. However, he spent his weekends and days off as a volunteer worker at Wakefield Museum where he successfully gained employment as a museum assistant. At the age of 25 he became the institution's director; he was the youngest museum director in the country. In 1952, Atkinson became Director of Halifax Museums and Art Gallery with responsibility for Shibden Hall, Bankfield Museum and Belle Vue. In 1958, he was appointed curator of the Bowes Museum, an art museum in Barnard Castle, Teesdale. Here, he first began to realise his vision of creating an English version of the open-air museums he had seen on a trip to Scandinavia in 1952. In 1966, Atkinson was instrumental in the setting-up of the working party that resulted in the creation of Beamish with him as its first director. The aim was to create an \\"Open-Air Museum for the purpose of studying, collecting, preserving and exhibiting buildings, machinery, objects and information illustrating the development of industry and the way of life of the North of England\\". He said of the creation of Beamish Museum: \\"It is essential that collecting be carried out quickly and on as big a scale as possible. It is now almost too late.\\" To this end, Atkinson initiated a policy of \\"unselective collecting\\", saying: \\"you offer it to us and we will collect it\\". This method of building up the collection proved highly successful and in addition forged links between the institution and the surrounding community. Beamish was also innovative in its operational arrangements, receiving funding and administrative assistance from a consortium of four neighbouring county councils ‚Äì Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Cleveland, and Durham; it was the UK's first museum to be run in this way. Under Atkinson's direction, Beamish was named the National Heritage 'Museum of the Year' in 1986, and the following year was awarded the title 'European Museum of the Year'. Atkinson attended the latter award ceremony despite having recently had cancer surgery. He retired the same year, although his association with Beamish continued; he served as President of the Friends of Beamish until his death. Following his retirement, Atkinson was Commissioner with the Museums and Galleries Commission (MGC) and Chairman of the Commission's Registration Committee, until December 1994. He had previously worked as an advisor for a number of national bodies in the museums and galleries sector. He also acted as an advisor to the Thomas Bewick Birthplace Trust, overseeing the handover of its archives to the National Trust in 1991. Awards and honours In 1980, Atkinson was awarded the OBE. Durham University conferred Atkinson an honorary doctorate of civil law (DCL) upon his retirement in 1987. He was later awarded the CBE in the 1995 New Year Honours list, for services to the development of museums. Private life Atkinson met his wife-to-be, Joan Peirson, when she joined the museum service in Halifax. They married on Valentine's Day 1953, celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary in 2013. They had three sons and from 1982 they lived in Ovingham, Northumberland, where Atkinson assisted in fundraising for repairs to the church tower and later became Vice-Chairman of the Parochial church council. Atkinson's hobbies included potholing, an interest he had discovered at the age of 12, as well as photography and collecting Natural History specimens such as beetles, ferns, fossils and minerals. Death and legacy Atkinson died on 30 December 2014, after a long illness. Richard Evans, the director of Beamish, told the BBC: > \\"The word 'visionary' is often overused perhaps, but in Frank's case it > really is true.

It took place on 19 April and was the eleventh race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The Amstel Gold Race is part of the Ardennes classics season, although it takes place in the Limburg region of the Netherlands rather than in the Belgian Ardennes. It takes place in the week before La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge, the other principal Ardennes classics. The defending champion in the 2015 edition of the race was Philippe Gilbert, who had won the race three times and had also won the 2012 world championships on a very similar course. The race took place on a route centred on the town of Valkenburg; the route included 34 short climbs, several of which were repeated. The decisive climb was the Cauberg, the fourth ascent of which came within of the finishing line. The race typically suits puncheurs. After several attacking groups were caught, the decisive action came on the final ascent of the Cauberg. A small group formed after the climb and sprinted for the race victory. The sprint was won by Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski, the reigning world champion; it was his first road race victory since he won the world championships. Alejandro Valverde () was second, with Michael Matthews () third.  Teams  The Amstel Gold Race is part of the UCI World Tour, which meant that the 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a team. The race organisers also made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams. The peloton was therefore made up of 25 teams. With eight riders on each team, a total of 200 riders were entered. Two of these, 's Dries Devenyns and Thomas Degand, were forced to pull out before the start (Degand with a stomach upset and Devenyns with a sore back), so 198 riders started the race.  Route  Route of the 2015 race The route of the 2015 Amstel Gold Race began in Maastricht and left the city towards the north. The riders passed through the towns of Bunde and Geulle on their way to the first climbs of the day. The first climb of the day was the Slingerberg; the peloton then passed through Beek and climbed the Adsteeg. These climbs came within the first of racing. The route then turned south through Meerssen, where the riders climbed the third climb, the Lange Raarberg, then east in the direction of Heerlen. The course turned, however, before they reached Heerlen, first heading south across the climb of the Bergseweg, then west. At this point, the route entered a series of circuits around the town of Valkenburg. The riders climbed the Sibbergrubbe and the Cauberg for the first time. The first climb of the Cauberg came after . The Cauberg, climbed four times during the race The first of the loops around Valkenburg was the longest at . The riders first climbed the Geulhemmerberg as they left Valkenburg, then turned south-east. The next contained no categorised climbs, though the roads were far from flat. The next climb, the Wolfsburg, came after and was followed quickly by the first climb of the Loorberg. The route then briefly turned north, before turning south again on the outskirts of Gulpen. The next climb, the Schweibergerweg, came after of racing, with the Camerig later. The riders then entered a short circuit around the town of Vaals, where the Drielandenpunt, the Gemmenich and the Vijlenerbos came within of one another. The route then returned to Gulpen along the same roads, with the Eperheide the only categorised climb. In Gulpen, the route crossed the Gulpenerberg, then turned east to cross the Plettenberg and the Eyserweg. The riders then reached Simpelveld, where they turned west again towards Valkenburg. The final part of the loop took the peloton across the climb of Huls and the Vrakelberg. As they entered Valkenburg, the riders climbed the Sibbergrubbe and the Cauberg for the second time. As the riders crossed the finish line in Valkenburg, they had completed and had remaining. The second loop was shorter than the first at . It again began with the climb of the Geulhemmerberg, then travelled through the outskirts of Maastricht. The route again turned north, this time to climb the Bemelerberg, before another turn to the south-east towards Beutenaken. The route re-used several of the roads that made up the first loop: the riders climbed the Loorberg for the second time, then turned north for the second climb of the Gulpenerberg. From this point, the peloton took a different route towards Valkenburg, which included the climbs of the Kruisberg, the Eyserbosweg, the Fromberg and the Keutenberg. On this loop, the riders did not climb the Sibbergrubbe but proceeded directly to the third climb of the Cauberg. This was seen as a moment when an early attack might succeed and came with remaining. The final loop was the shortest of the day at . The riders climbed the Geulhemmerberg for the third time, then the Bemelerberg for the second time. This was the penultimate climb of the day. The final climb was a fourth ascent of the Cauberg. At the base of the climb, there were remaining. The climb itself is in length, with an average gradient of 7% and a maximum gradient of 12%. At the top of the climb, there were approximately of fairly flat roads to the finish line in Berg en Terblijt.  Pre-race favourites  Philippe Gilbert, three-time winner of the race, wearing the rainbow jersey he won on a similar course in the 2012 world championships The Amstel Gold Race has been won in the past by riders who have attacked a long distance from the finish line. This happened as recently as 2013, when Roman Kreuziger attacked shortly after the penultimate climb of the Cauberg. Normally, however, the race is decided on the final ascent of the Cauberg; in the 2014 edition, Philippe Gilbert () attacked midway up the climb and was able to take a solo victory. As there is a flat section after the climb, there is also an opportunity for riders dropped on the Cauberg to rejoin any escapees and to bring the race together for a sprint finish. The race was therefore expected to suit puncheurs, especially those who were also able to defend a solo lead ahead of a chasing group. Gilbert, the defending champion, was the main favourite for the race. As well as his 2014 victory, he had won the race in 2010 and 2011; he also won the 2012 world championships road race, which was raced on a very similar course. Gilbert had demonstrated good form by coming third the previous week in the Brabantse Pijl. Several other former champions took part in 2014: Kreuziger (), Enrico Gasparotto (), Damiano Cunego (), Fr√§nk Schleck (), Stefan Schumacher and Davide Rebellin (both ). Alejandro Valverde (), who had come fourth in 2014, was also among the major favourites and was in strong form following three stage wins during the Volta a Catalunya. Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski (), the current world champion, Joaquim Rodr√≠guez () and Michael Matthews () were also considered to have a strong chance of winning the race. Matthews in particular was the favourite to win any small bunch sprint if a group came together after the Cauberg.  Race report  An early breakaway was formed by six riders after more than , after the climb of the Lange Raarberg. The six riders were Laurens De Vreese (), Jan Polanc (), Timo Roosen (), Linus Gerdemann (), Johan Van Zyl () and Mike Terpstra (). The peloton initially hesitated in letting the break escape, but soon relented and the leading group's advantage grew to approximately 10 minutes by the time they reached Mechelen after of racing. The peloton was led by and . There were several crashes during this phase of the race; Jelle Vanendert (), who was second in 2014, and Lieuwe Westra () were among the riders forced to abandon the race. As the riders crossed the finish line for the second time, with remaining, they had a lead of approximately six minutes as the riders in the peloton began to chase. Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski (here pictured after winning the 2014 world championships road race) won his first race in the rainbow jersey in a sprint finish On the second loop around Valkenburg, came to the front of the peloton to chase the breakaway in support of Alejandro Valverde. They reduced the breakaway's lead to four minutes and briefly broke a small group free on the descent from the Bemelerberg, but a mechanical problem for Valverde forced them to stop chasing and bring him back to the front of the peloton. As the riders came to the end of the loop, three riders had been dropped from the breakaway and the group's lead was under a minute. The first attacks from the peloton came on the Eyserbosweg, with David Tanner () and Simon Clarke () attacking and forming a lead group. A second group attacked, made up of Tony Martin (), Vincenzo Nibali and Diego Rosa (both ), Wilco Kelderman (), Damiano Caruso (BMC) and Alex Howes (). With remaining, Clarke and Tanner had an 11-second lead over the second group, with the peloton a further 24 seconds behind. The original breakaway, meanwhile, had been caught. Kelderman missed a corner shortly afterwards and was forced to ride through a field to rejoin the race; he was unable to catch up with the leading riders. The two groups came together shortly afterwards, although there was some disagreement in the group about the riders' commitment to the breakaway attempt. Rosa and Caruso crashed on a corner, reducing the group to five riders, while Movistar were again leading the chasing peloton. The group was caught with remaining. Clarke then attacked again, but was caught later. One final attack was made by Jakob Fuglsang () and Greg Van Avermaet (); Van Avermaet refused to assist Fuglsang in setting the pace and they were soon caught. The peloton was therefore all together for the final ascent of the Cauberg. In 2014, Samuel S√°nchez (then BMC) had attacked at the foot of the Cauberg on behalf of his teammate Philippe Gilbert, whose subsequent attack allowed him to take the race victory. BMC attempted to replicate this strategy with an attack from Ben Hermans in the same place as S√°nchez's. Gilbert's attack, however, was less successful than his 2014 effort: although most riders were dropped, Michael Matthews was able to hold his wheel. Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski was chasing alone at this point. Valverde bridged across to Gilbert and Matthews, with another 15 riders joining the group shortly afterwards. Kwiatkowski was a long way behind with remaining, but was able to stay in the slipstream of the other riders and recover from the climb. He then began a long sprint and was able to keep the rest of the group behind him. Valverde finished second, with Matthews third. Kwiatkowski's win was his first win in the rainbow jersey of the world champion.  Results   Post-race analysis   Riders' reactions  Kwiatkowski's win was his first road race victory since his victory at the 2014 world championships (his only other 2015 victory was in the prologue individual time trial at the 2015 Paris- Nice). He also became the fourth rider to win the Amstel Gold Race while wearing the rainbow jersey; the others were Eddy Merckx, Jan Raas and Bernard Hinault. He described the race as \\"an amazing day\\" and said that it \\"[put] the dot on the i\\" following the team's second-place finishes at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. BMC were praised for their tactics after the race, despite Gilbert's failure to repeat his victory; his tenth-place finish was his worst result in several years. Gilbert attributed his failure to stay away from the chasing pack in part to the lack of a tailwind on the final flat section after the Cauberg, while his reputation as the main favourite for the race also worked to his disadvantage. Valverde, meanwhile, was delighted at his second-place finish, which was the best result of his career at the Amstel Gold Race, declaring himself \\"happy with second\\" and looking forward to the remainder of the Ardennes classics.  UCI World Tour rankings  After winning 80 points for his victory in the race, Kwiatkowski moved up from thirteenth place to fourth place in the UCI World Tour rankings. His total of 195 points left him 108 points behind the leader, Richie Porte (). Valverde also moved into the top ten of the World Tour rankings. moved ahead of to take the lead in the teams' ranking; Australia remained in the lead of the nations' rankings.For the individual rankings, see *For the teams rankings, see *For the nations ranking, see  References   External links   Category:Amstel Gold Race Category:2015 UCI World Tour Category:2015 in Dutch sport Category:April 2015 sports events in Europe ","title":"2015 Amstel Gold Race"},{"id":"44940846","text":"The 2015 La Fl√®che Wallonne was the 79th edition of the La Fl√®che Wallonne one-day cycling classic. It took place on 22 April and was the twelfth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. La Fl√®che Wallonne is the second of the three Ardennes classics; it comes three days after the Amstel Gold Race (won in 2015 by Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski) and four days before the Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. The defending champion in the race was Alejandro Valverde (). The race took place on a route that started in Waremme and ends in Huy. The key aspect of La Fl√®che Wallonne is the climb of the Mur de Huy, which is crossed three times during the race; the finishing line is at the top of the final climb of the Mur. The race typically suits both puncheurs and climbers. La Fl√®che Wallonne had added importance in 2015 because the second stage of the 2015 Tour de France was also scheduled to finish on the Mur, so several riders rode the race as preparation. Despite the addition of an additional climb late in the race, a group formed at the base of the Mur. Valverde won his third victory on the climb, with Julian Alaphilippe () second and Michael Albasini () third; Valverde went on to win Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge as well. La Fl√®che Wallonne was affected by many crashes, which caused the withdrawal of several of the favourites for race victory, including Philippe Gilbert (), Dan Martin () and Chris Froome ().  Teams  La Fl√®che Wallonne is part of the UCI World Tour, which meant that the 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a team. The race organisers (ASO, which also organises the Tour de France) made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams. The peloton was therefore made up of 25 teams. Each team was required to enter between five and eight, so the maximum size of the peloton was 200 riders. and , however, only entered seven riders each, so 198 riders were entered into the race.  Route  upright=2 The route of the 2015 La Fl√®che Wallonne began in Waremme in the province of Li√®ge on the Rue de Huy with a neutralised zone. The first part of the route went south-east through Faimes and Saint-Georges- sur-Meuse before reaching the day's first climb, the C√¥te des 36 Tournants, after . After the climb, the riders continued south-east to Anthisnes; here the route turned south. It passed through Ouffet, then reached Durbuy after . The route then turned west to pass through Havelange before reaching Ohey after . The roads between the C√¥te des 36 Tournants and Ohey were not entirely flat, but there were no categorised climbs. The Mur de Huy was climbed three times during the race. The finish line came at the top of the climb. After reaching Ohey, the route entered a series of loops. The riders first travelled north, south-west and then north again to reach the day's second climb, the C√¥te de Bellaire, after of racing. The route continued north to Andenne, then east to the third climb, the C√¥te de Bohissau, into the race. The riders then rode north-east to reach the first ascent of the Mur de Huy. The first climb of the Mur came with raced and to the finish line; it was followed by the day's only feed zone. The peloton continued riding east as far as Modave, where the course turned to the south-west. The C√¥te d'Ereffe was climbed after as the riders returned to Ohey. The race then used the same roads as before between Ohey and Huy, repeating the ascents of the C√¥te de Bellaire, the C√¥te de Bohissau and the Mur de Huy. The second and penultimate ascent of the Mur came after ; there were remaining. The final loop of the race followed the same roads as before, east out of Huy and then south-west to the C√¥te d'Ereffe, climbed with remaining. After this climb, however, the route turned north to take a more direct route to Huy, though some of the same roads were used. Within the town, the riders were faced with a slightly different route and a climb new to the 2015 edition of the race, the C√¥te de Cherave. The roads before the climb were narrow and twisting, with a level crossing at the foot of the climb. The hill itself was in length with an average gradient of 8.1%; the steepest section came in the first part. The top of the C√¥te de Cherave came with to the finish line and was followed by a sharp right-hand turn and a fast descent back into Huy. The crucial part of the race was the final climb of the Mur de Huy, which has an average gradient of 9.6%. The first section of the climb has a gradient less than 7%; after this it increases to about 10%. The steepest section comes after with an S-bend. The steepest part of the climb has a gradient of about 24%; many past races have been won with attacks at this point. The finish line came at the very top of the climb.  Pre-race favourites  Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski, photographed here after winning the 2014 World Championships, was one of the favourites for race victory Recent editions of the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The addition of the C√¥te de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered much more likely than in previous years that a group of riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Fl√®che Wallonne since 2003. The strongest favourite for the race victory was Alejandro Valverde (), who was the defending champion and who had also won the race in 2006. Valverde had shown good form by coming second in the Amstel Gold Race behind Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski (); Valverde was expected to have an advantage on the steep climb of the Mur, though Kwiatkowski was still among the favourites for victory. Three other former winners entered the 2015 race. These were Philippe Gilbert (), who had won the race in 2011; Joaquim Rodr√≠guez (), who had won in 2012; and Daniel Moreno (), who had won in 2013. All of there were well suited to the steep final climb. Other riders considered to have a chance of victory included Dan Martin (), Sergio Henao () and several other climbers and puncheurs. Because the third stage of the 2015 Tour de France was scheduled to finish on exactly the same roads, several riders who were aiming at success there rode La Fl√®che Wallonne as preparation. These included Chris Froome (), Vincenzo Nibali () and Nairo Quintana ().  Race report   Early stages  A breakaway formed within the first of racing. There were seven riders in the break: Thomas De Gendt (), Mike Teunissen (), Brice Feillu (), J√©r√¥me Baugnies (), Reinier Honig (), Daniele Ratto (), and Pieter Vanspeybrouck (). The breakaway initially built an eight-minute lead, with De Gendt leading the group over the climbs. The main peloton was led principally by Movistar and . The first major action of the race occurred as the riders approached the first ascent of the Mur de Huy. Dan Martin, one of the favourites for the race, touched wheels with Tiago Machado (Katusha) and both riders crashed. Martin returned to his bike and chased back to the peloton with the help of several teammates, but later withdrew. He had hit his head in the crash and wished to recover ahead of the Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge the following weekend. Several other riders were caught up or delayed, including Chris Froome. At the top of the first ascent of the Mur, the breakaway's lead had been cut to under six minutes. After the riders left Huy, Team Sky came to the front of the peloton with Peter Kennaugh; his riding at the front of the bunch reduced the gap to under five minutes. Honig and Teunissen were dropped from the leading group on the second climb of the C√¥te de Bellaire. Katusha and Movistar were joined at the front of the peloton by Etixx-Quick Step as the race returned towards Huy.  Final loops around Huy  Another crash followed before the climb; this crash was caused by riders' bunching together on a road made narrower by parked cars on either side. The most significant rider caught in this crash was Philippe Gilbert; others were Juli√°n Arredondo and Bob Jungels (both ). Gilbert got up slowly, with his shorts and jersey ripped. He abandoned shortly afterwards. The next significant crash came with remaining. This took out Lars Petter Nordhaug and Wouter Poels (Team Sky), Ben King (Garmin-Cannondale), Amael Moinard (BMC) and Anthony Roux (). Poels ended up stuck in a ditch for some time with Roux injured on top of him. Another crash happened shortly afterwards, involving Jelle Vanendert (Lotto-Soudal), Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and K√©vin Reza (FDJ). On the penultimate climb of the Mur, the breakaway split; only De Gendt and Baugnies remained in the lead, 50 seconds ahead of the peloton. Giovanni Visconti (Movistar) and Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez (Astana) attacked the peloton on the climb and joined De Gendt and Baugnies soon afterwards, while Etixx-Quick Step and Katusha led the chase in the peloton. Tejay van Garderen (BMC) attacked on the Col d'Ereffe, while Visconti and S√°nchez soon dropped De Gendt and Baugnies. De Gendt helped his teammate Louis Vervaeke bridge up to Van Garderen. Vervaeke, Van Garderen and Baugnies combined briefly, but were unable to catch the leading pair and were themselves caught by the peloton with remaining.  Race finale  Visconti and S√°nchez continued in the lead; they had 20 seconds lead with left. At this point, another crash occurred in the peloton. This included several riders, Samuel S√°nchez (BMC), Bryan Coquard () and Chris Froome. Froome suffered cuts on his left side, with blood visible through rips on his shorts. He continued to the end of the race, however, and reached the finish line in 123rd place, over 12 minutes behind the leaders. As the peloton headed towards the penultimate climb, the C√¥te de Cherave, Huub Duyn () attacked but was unable to build a lead, with Tony Martin leading the peloton on behalf of Kwiatkowski. On the climb, Vincenzo Nibali attacked; he could not build a gap to the group, but did bring them closer to Visconti and S√°nchez. Soon afterwards, Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal) attacked, catching and passing the leading pair. Giampaolo Caruso (Katusha) attempted to follow; he was unable to join Wellens and was recaptured by the pack soon afterwards. Wellens had a 14-second lead at the foot of the final climb of the Mur de Huy. The peloton was led by Lampre-Merida for the first part of the ascent. The peloton stayed together for most of the climb, with no rider escaping on the steep sections. In the final few hundred metres, however, Valverde came to the front of the group. He wound the pace up gradually before sprinting within sight of the line. He took the race victory with a significant gap to the riders behind. Julian Alaphilippe (Etixx-Quick Step) finished in second place, with Michael Albasini () third.  Result   After the race   Reactions  The race was described afterwards as \\"an incredibly boring race\\" by Cycling Weekly. Valverde, however, said that it was \\"dangerous\\", with all the crashes happening at the front of the peloton, and that it was \\"the most nervous race I can remember doing\\". The 2015 race was his third victory in La Fl√®che Wallonne, bringing him level with Eddy Merckx; Valverde described this as a \\"great honour\\". His aim after the race was to win a third victory at the Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge, which he succeeded in doing. Alaphilippe said after the race that he had not been intending to go for the sprint at the end of the race; the team's plan was to set up Kwiatkowski. He started sprinting only after his directeur sportif shouted \\"go, go\\" at him over the radio. Alaphilippe said that he had briefly thought that he was going to win the sprint; his second-place finish was, however, the most important result of his career so far. He said, \\"For my first time performance here, I can't help but be pleased.\\" Albasini's third place was better than his team had expected: before the race, 's directeur sportif Matt White had not expected him to be as strong because of the addition of the extra climb. Albasini himself also described the race as \\"a lot tenser\\"; he also said that Valverde was \\"one of the strongest guys in those kinds of finishes\\". One of the consequences of the high number of crashes in the race was a number of injuries to several prominent riders. These included Dan Martin, who was left with \\"contusions, abrasions and soreness in his neck\\"; Martin himself described himself as suffering from whiplash and as feeling \\"crappy\\", though he still intended to start Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. Philippe Gilbert likewise described his crash as \\"not the best preparation\\" and planned a trip to an osteopath to help his recovery. Chris Froome did not suffer any significant injuries but did not plan to start in Li√®ge; he went instead to do reconnaissance of the cobbled stage of the Tour de France and his next scheduled race was the following week at the Tour de Romandie.  UCI World Tour rankings  Riders who finished in the top ten in La Fl√®che Wallonne were awarded points in the UCI World Tour rankings. Valverde, as the race winner, won 80 points; Kelderman won 2 points for his tenth-place finish. Valverde moved from eighth to second place in the rankings; his 238 points left him 65 points behind Richie Porte, the leader of the ranking. Joaquim Rodr√≠guez also moved up in the rankings from sixteenth to ninth place. Spain remained in second place in the nations' rankings, one point behind Australia, with Colombia moving ahead of the Netherlands into third place and France returning to the top 10. Etixx-Quick Step retained their lead in the teams' rankings.For the individual rankings, see * For the nations' rankings, see * For the teams' ranking, see  References  *  External links  * Category:La Fl√®che Wallonne Fleche Wallonne Fleche Wallonne ","title":"2015 La Fl√®che Wallonne"},{"id":"44940866","text":"Kim (Keimpe) Henry Veltman (5 September 1948 ‚Äì 1 April 2020) was a Dutch/Canadian historian of science and art, director of the Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute (VMMI), consultant and author, known for his contributions in the fields of \\"linear perspective and the visual dimensions of science and art,\\" new media, culture and society.

It was the 101st edition of the Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge one-day cycling race and was the fourth cycling monument of the 2015 season. It was part of the 2015 UCI World Tour and was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), who also organise the Tour de France. 200 riders raced over a route that started in Li√®ge, travelled south to Bastogne, then returned north by an indirect route to finish in Ans on the outskirts of Li√®ge. The route included many hills, especially in the final , which were the principal difficulty in the race. There were many attacks in the final part of the race, with several groups breaking away from the peloton and subsequently being caught. A small group came together on the final ascent to the finish line, where the race was decided in a sprint. It was won by the pre-race favourite, Alejandro Valverde (), ahead of Julian Alaphilippe () and Joaquim Rodr√≠guez (). This was Valverde's third victory in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge and put him into the lead of the World Tour standings.  Background  Eddy Merckx, photographed here during the 1967 Giro d'Italia, holds the record for the most wins in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge was established in 1892 and is one of the oldest races on the cycling calendar. Milano‚ÄìTorino is the only current race to have begun earlier, although it did not exist as a regular event until the 1920s. Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge was founded as a precursor to a planned Li√®ge‚ÄìParis‚ÄìLi√®ge event, which never came about, but eventually became one of the most important races on the cycling calendar in its own right. The race has come to be seen as one of the cycling Monuments, alongside Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, the Tour of Flanders, Paris‚ÄìRoubaix and the Giro di Lombardia. Because Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge is the oldest of the major races on the cycling calendar, it has been given the nickname ' (English: The Old Lady). It is particularly known as a race where the best one-day riders and the best Grand Tour riders can compete on relatively equal terms. In his book The Monuments, Peter Cossins wrote that Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge \\"is generally regarded as the toughest one-day race on the calendar\\". Eddy Merckx holds the record for the most victories: he won five times between 1969 and 1975. Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge was the fourth of the Monuments to take place in the 2015 season. Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and Paris‚ÄìRoubaix has been won by John Degenkolb (), while the Tour of Flanders was won by Alexander Kristoff (). Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge was the final event of the spring classics season and came as the conclusion to the Ardennes classics, following the Amstel Gold Race and La Fl√®che Wallonne. It was also part of the 2015 UCI World Tour, a season-long competition that included both one-day events and stage races.  Teams  As it is part of the UCI World Tour, the 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a team to Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. The race organisers (ASO, which also organises the Tour de France) also made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams. The peloton was therefore made up of 25 teams. Six of the teams were also invited to La Fl√®che Wallonne. These included two Belgian teams ( and ), two French teams ( and ), and . The final two teams to be invited to Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge were (whose invitation meant that they would participate in all five Monuments in 2015) and . As each team was required to enter between five and eight riders, the maximum size of the peloton was 200 riders.  Route  Profile of the 2015 Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge The route for the 2015 race was announced on 15 April. The route was shorter than in 2014; it was therefore in length. The changes came in the final section of the route, with the C√¥te de la Vecqu√©e removed and the Col du Rosier and the Col du Maquisard added instead. The second change was a reduction in distance between the third-last and second-last climbs: the distance was cut from to , with a small unclassified climb also added. Cyclingnews.com described the first change as a \\"much harder combination\\" suggested that the new route would make the race more interesting than the 2014 edition, which it described as \\"painfully dull\\". The race began in Li√®ge, in Place Saint-Lambert outside the Prince-Bishops' Palace, with a neutral zone that took the riders out of the town to the south. The first of the race brought the peloton south, through Aywaille to La Roche-en-Ardenne; although the roads were not flat there were no difficult or categorised climbs. Here the riders encountered the first classified climb of the day, the C√¥te de la Roche-en-Ardenne ( at an average gradient of 6.2%). After reaching the summit, the riders continued south for another . This took them through Bertogne to Bastogne, which they reached after of racing. This was the turning-point: from here the route turned to the north to return towards Li√®ge. The northern leg of the race was both longer ‚Äì ‚Äì and more difficult ‚Äì it included nine categorised climbs. The C√¥te de La Redoute, photographed in 2007. Messages from fans to the riders can be seen painted on the road. After turning around at the Rond-point La Doyenne (named after the race itself), the peloton left Bastogne to the north-east. The first were fairly flat and took the riders to Houffalize. After a fast descent came the C√¥te de Saint-Roch ( at 11.2%). Another fairly flat section followed: the route continued north for approximately on fairly major roads through Gouvy and Vielsalm. At this point, with to the finish line, there were still eight categorised climbs remaining. The first three of these climbs came in quick succession. These were the C√¥te de Wanne ( at 7.4%), the C√¥te de Stockeu ( at 12.5%) and the C√¥te de la Haute-Lev√©e ( at 5.6%). The C√¥te de Wanne was narrow and badly surfaced, with a dangerous descent following. The C√¥te de Stockeu was described by Cycling Weekly as a \\"killer climb\\", because of its steep gradient, its narrowness and its poor road surface. The C√¥te de la Haute-Lev√©e was unique on the course because it included a section of cobblestones. The view from the top of the final climb in Ans. The flamme rouge can be seen in the background.These climbs brought the riders to Stavelot. Soon afterwards, there was a hairpin turn that took them towards the two climbs new to the 2015 edition. The first of these was the Col du Rosier ( at 5.9%), which was the longest climb of the day. The riders then descended through the town of Spa and turned west onto the Col du Maquisard ( at 5%), which they crossed with to the finish line. The route then crossed over the roads used for the southern leg as the riders entered the final section of the race. The following climb was C√¥te de La Redoute ( at 8.9%), with from the summit to the finish line. Cyclingnews.com described La Redoute as \\"the most emblematic climb of the entire race\\". It had an uneven gradient: the first was at about 8%, before at around 13% and another at 6%. The riders descended down twisting roads, crossed over the uncategorised C√¥te de Sprimont, before coming to the penultimate climb, the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons ( at 9.4%) with to the finish line. This was one of the most difficult climbs of the race, with frequent changes of gradient and a poor road surface. There was then another uncategorised climb and a steep descent into the outskirts of Li√®ge. The final climb of the day came with remaining. This was the C√¥te de Saint-Nicolas ( at 8.6%). Cycling Weekly described it as \\"a succession of steep corners with nothing between\\". After the descent from the climb, the riders entered Ans, the finishing town. There was a long, straight road that started from the finish line. After of flat, the road climbed towards the finish at around 5%. With around to go, there was a left-hand turn that took the riders to the finish line.  Pre-race favourites  Alejandro Valverde () was one of the principal favourites for the race victory (photographed later in the season at the Vuelta a Espa√±a). Recent editions of Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge had been won in several different ways. Andy Schleck (then riding for ) had won a solo victory with a long-distance attack in 2009, while Dan Martin () had attacked late on to win in 2013. The 2010 edition was won by a two-man breakaway and the 2011 edition by a three-man group. The defending champion, Simon Gerrans () won the 2014 edition in a bunch sprint after a large group came to Ans together. The pattern of the 2015 edition was therefore hard to predict. One consistent pattern, however, was that recent editions of the race had been won by major names rather than by outsiders. Alejandro Valverde () had won La Fl√®che Wallonne during the week that preceded Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge and he was one of the major favourites to take the victory. Valverde had won the race on two previous occasions (in 2006 and 2008) and had also been on the podium on four other occasions. Valverde's status as the major favourite had the potential to work against him, however, as other riders were expected to mark him closely and perhaps prevent him from winning. Philippe Gilbert () had suffered from this problem in the Amstel Gold Race. The other major favourite for the race was the reigning world champion, Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski (). Kwiatkowski had finished third in the 2014 Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge and had already won the Amstel Gold Race in 2015. Although he had not been as strong as had been expected in La Fl√®che Wallonne, the longer climbs of Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge were expected to suit him better. Other favourites included Joaquim Rodr√≠guez (Katusha), Rui Costa () and Dan Martin, as well as Vincenzo Nibali () and Tim Wellens (). Simon Gerrans had suffered an injury earlier in the season and had not fully recovered; he was not expected to be able to defend his title. Similarly, Philippe Gilbert had suffered a fall in La Fl√®che Wallonne; he was also not as well suited to the route of Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge as he was to the other Ardennes classics.  Race report  The race began with hard racing for the first hour until the day's main breakaway was formed, with around raced. The breakaway involved eight riders. These were Diego Ulissi (), Matteo Montaguti (), Otto Vergaerde (), Cl√©ment Chevrier (), Marco Minnaard (), Anthony Turgis (), Cesare Benedetti () and Rasmus Quaade (). The group's lead soon extended to nearly eight minutes, while the peloton was led by . Europcar's work reduced the breakaway's lead by around three minutes by the time of the C√¥te de La Roche-en-Ardenne, into the race. After the turn in Bastogne, the breakaway continued. It was, however, reduced in numbers, as Quaade, Chevrier and Vergaerde all fell back before the peloton reached the C√¥te de Wanne, four hours into the race. Katusha led the peloton as it approached the climb. On the climb itself, Astana came to the front of the peloton and led the chase, with the breakaway's lead reduced to under a minute. On the C√¥te de Stockeu, Andriy Hrivko (Astana), Gorka Izagirre (Movistar) and Simon Yates () attacked and joined the lead group; more riders then bridged across to form a 21-man group. This included five Astana riders, though not Nibali. On the C√¥te de la Haute-Lev√©e, several riders attacked again to form a smaller breakaway; these were Tanel Kangert and Michele Scarponi (both Astana), Manuele Boaro (), Esteban Chaves (Orica-GreenEDGE) and Juli√°n Arredondo (). They had a 25-second lead at the summit and, although Boaro and Arredondo were dropped on the Col du Rosier, this increased to more than a minute for a short while. It was reduced to 45 seconds on the Col du Maquisard, however, as Movistar worked hard in the peloton to bring them back. alt=See caption As the peloton approached the C√¥te de la Redoute, there was a large crash. Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fr√§nk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders at the foot of the climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time. Alejandro Valverde () (centre) receiving the winner's trophy, with Julian Alaphilippe (left) and Joaquim Rodr√≠guez. On the Col de la Redoute itself, Kangert was dropped from the breakaway; Scarponi and Chaves had a 35-second lead at the summit and were caught around later. The riders then entered the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons, where Roman Kreuziger (Tinkoff-Saxo) and Giampaolo Caruso (Katusha) attacked; they were quickly joined by Jakob Fuglsang (Astana) and had an 18-second lead at the summit. Several riders attempted to form chase groups; eventually a six-man chase group was formed by Giovanni Visconti (Movistar), Julian Alaphilippe (Etixx-Quick Step), Rui Costa (Lampre-M√©rida), Samuel S√°nchez () and Daniel Moreno (Katusha). They stayed away for a short while and were then joined by around 20 other riders with remaining as rain began to fall. Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar (Etixx-Quick Step) took over the pace-setting in the peloton as it approached the C√¥te de Saint-Nicolas and he reduced the gap to Kreuziger, Caruso and Fuglsang. On the climb, Valverde came to the front of the group to control the pace. Nibali then attacked and, while he was not able to escape the group, several riders were dropped. These included Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski and Philippe Gilbert. Nibali's attack also brought the chasing group back to the leaders. The next attack came from Romain Bardet () on the descent from the C√¥te de Saint-Nicolas. While he too was unable to break away from the group, his attack did cause Nibali to lose contact and reduced the group to ten riders. Giampaolo Caruso led the group into Ans and towards the climb to the finish. At the foot of the climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, attacked and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodr√≠guez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodr√≠guez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodr√≠guez in the final metres to take second place.  Result   Post-race analysis   Rider reactions  Valverde's win was the third victory at Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge in his career. He became one of only six riders to have three or more victories in the race. Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge also concluded a very successful Ardennes week for him: he had two victories and one second- place finish in the three races. Valverde was the first rider since Philippe Gilbert in 2011 to win both La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge in the same week and, although he was one place away from imitating Gilbert's Ardennes triple, he described it as a \\"great week\\". Alaphilippe's second-place finish was the best for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was struggling on the C√¥te de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this was similar to the events in La Fl√®che Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race \\"today I really felt I could have done something more\\". Cyclingnews.com suggested after the race that he had the potential to win a Monument in the future. Several riders were injured in the crash from the finish. The worst-affected was Yukiya Arashiro, who suffered several broken bones. Gianluca Brambilla (Etixx-Quick Step) broke his collarbone. had two riders with injuries: Paul Martens broke his hand and Bram Tankink suffered from concussion and bruises. Nicolas Roche and Simon Gerrans both suffered some discomfort after their crashes, but neither had significant injuries. Dan Martin rode the Tour de Romandie the following week. After he suffered with his breathing through the race, he discovered that he had broken two ribs in the crash in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge.  UCI World Tour rankings  After his strong Ardennes week, Valverde moved into the lead of the UCI World Tour individual rankings, with Richie Porte () dropping to second place. Rui Costa also moved into the top ten. Spain moved ahead of Australia in the nations' standings, while Etixx-Quick Step retained their lead of the team rankings.

The palpebral lobes in M. hicksii are approximately same length as the postoccular sections of the facial sutures, whereas in cranidia assigned to hicksii by Vanek et al.

Basal glabellar width in hicksii is notably narrower (tr.) than each posterior cranidial border (tr.), in contrast to basal glabellar width in the Czech species which is clearly greater (tr.) than the posterior fixigenal width.

The glabella is anteriorly more rounded than in Mawddachites hicksii and in fact is almost perfectly circular in outline excluding the preoccipital lobe.

It also has boarding facilities, It is one of the top and most academic private schools in Pretoria  General information  Located in Pretoria's eastern suburbs, Pro Arte Alphen Park is an English High School.  History  The history of the school began in 1964, when a commercial, Afrikaans medium school was built in the suburb of Alphen Park across the Ashlea Gardens estate. The school was successful in attracting students who wanted to pursue a career in the financial services sector which was growing steadily at that time. The school accommodated over 800 students and operated for 30 years until 1994. Concurrently, the Pretoria school of Art, music and ballet was operating on the grounds of Pretoria Boys High School which is now the Pollock campus of Boys High. The arrangement was temporary as it seems that the state was planning on financing the construction of a new art school in Pretoria with its own grounds and facilities. By the 1980s, the state of South Africa had great economic pressures due to the political context of the time and as a result, there was a shortage of funds that could be utilized to construct a new arts school from fresh. A decision was taken by the Transvaal department of education to move the art school from Pollock campus to the grounds of the commercial school in Alphen Park. The process of integrating the two schools was completed by 1992 and by 1994, the school started operating as a new, fully integrated Pro Arte Alphen Park. This school focused school of specialisation with attention paid to the arts and enterprise management. Today, the school continues in its tradition of arts that it obtained from the Pretoria Art School alongside a tradition of enterprise management that it got from the commercial school. The school thus has six study fields including art, music, dance, drama alongside enterprise management and hospitality studies.Khumo Thage, Pro Arte Alphen Park Alumni  Subjects offered   Grades 8-and 9   Compulsory subjects  *English HL *Mathematics *Social Sciences *Natural Sciences *Technology *Afrikaans FAL *French SAL *Life Orientation *Economic and Management Sciences *Arts & Culture  Main Focus Area Subjects  One of the following - All focus areas and acceptance at the school is subject to Auditions.

First appearing in the historical record in 1202, Maulay was in England by 1204 and serving as an official of John. During the rebellions of the end of John's reign, Maulay supported the king and was given custody of the king's younger son as well as important prisoners. Maulay continued to serve the new king after 1216 but ran into difficulties with the regents for the young King Henry III and was accused of treason in 1221. Although cleared of the treason accusation, Maulay retired to his lands in late 1221. In 1223 Maulay's lands at Upavon were confiscated by the king but were returned within a few months. Upavon was again confiscated in 1229 and given to another noble, but in 1233 King Henry regranted the manor to Maulay, an event which led to a revolt by Richard Marshal, the Earl of Pembroke, against the king. In 1241 Maulay went on crusade and died in late 1241, probably in the Holy Land while on crusade. Early life Maulay's parentage is unknown, but he originated from the Maulay region in Poitou. He appears to have had a younger brother named Aimery, who possibly was the same as an Aimery de Maulay who owned lands in Quin√ßay and La Rochelle between 1218 and 1259. In a monastic chronicle, Peter is said to have relinquished his lands in France to Aimery in 1204,Vincent Peter des Roches p. 26 footnote 60 after the overlordship of the lands passed from King John of England to King Philip II of France.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 29 Peter's first appearance in the historical record was in 1202, when he received land around Loudun in exchange for Moncontour.Cockayne Complete Peerage VIII pp. 555‚Äì558 Under John, he was appointed an usher in the king's household,Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 20 where he soon became a close advisor of the king. He was considered one of the \\"evil counsellors\\" of John by the chronicler Roger of Wendover.Vincent \\"Maulay, Peter (I) de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and was given the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who forfeited his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, would need to be restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire.Sanders English Baronies pp. 66‚Äì67 Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine for the right to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John.Turner King John p. 79 According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 138 When the barons of England revolted against John in 1215, Maulay was given command of Corfe Castle by John. Along with Corfe, Maulay was also given custody of John's younger son, Richard of Cornwall. He was also given Gomshall in Surrey. In 1216 he was given the office of Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset, where he made a name for himself with his exactions and heavy profiteering. Besides the custody of Richard of Cornwall, Maulay was also responsible for supervising the confinement of John's niece, Eleanor of Brittany, who, as the daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, elder brother of King John,Warren King John p. 37 had a strong claim to the English throne and had been held captive since 1202.Warren King John p. 77 At times, he was also responsible for keeping John's wife, Isabella of Angouleme and his heir, Prince Henry, safe from rebels, as long as they were at Corfe.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 71 Under Henry III Maulay remained in office under the new king, Henry III, who succeeded to the throne in late 1216. While at Corfe, he had custody of William of Lancaster, who had been captured by the royalist side at Rochester in 1215. Ranulf de Blondeville, the Earl of Chester, attempted to secure William's freedom but was rebuffed by Maulay, leading the earl to threaten to depart England and the king's cause and go on crusade.Carpenter Minority of Henry III pp. 26‚Äì27 In early 1217 Maulay was ordered by the regent, William Marshal, to surrender control of Sherborne Castle and Somerset to William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, to help secure the return of Longespee to the royal cause.Carpenter Minority of Henry III pp. 30‚Äì31 But Maulay refused to do so.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 35 In October 1217, Maulay was summoned to the royal court to answer charges that he had waged a private war against the earl over control of Somerset, and that he had broken a truce that had held between the two men.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 66 The dispute was finally solved in February 1218 when Maulay was confirmed by the regent as custodian of Sherborne Castle and in the office of Sheriff of Somerset. Maulay compensated Longespee for his loss with a payment of 500 pounds, and a further payment of 1000 pounds by the government and custody of a royal ward.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 71 Maulay received a total of 6561 marks by 1221 from ransoms paid by 16 prisoners he held at Corfe.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 46 He also paid nothing into the Exchequer from Somerset or Dorset for the period from 1218 to 1220,Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 72 with the total owed to the government amounting to a bit over 1500 pounds.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 120 Maulay's extortions, however, led to him losing custody of Richard of Cornwall in 1220. Maulay brought Richard of Cornwall to London to attend his brother's second coronation,Denholm-Young Richard of Cornwall p. 3 which occurred on 17 May 1220.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 188 Treason accusations On 20 May 1221 Maulay was accused of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The specific crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more to the fact that Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power.Carptenter Minority of Henry III p. 249 In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from the charges of treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 256 In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breaut√©, another of des Roches supporters.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 260 The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure,Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 270 and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks.Carpenter Minority of Henry III pp. 274‚Äì275 Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire. Upavon case In February 1223, Maulay forfeited Upavon to the king. This was part of a string of confiscations that struck at supporters of des Roches, including William de Cantilupe, Breaut√©, and Robert de Vieuxpont, by taking back grants that had been made earlier and which were held at the king's will. The seizures were made to teach the nobles a lesson and curb their dissension from the royal government, which was in the hands of Roches' rival de Burgh. Most of the manors, including Upavon, were returned to their previous holders in April after a settlement between de Burgh and those who resented his government.Carpenter Minority of Henry III pp. 346‚Äì350 Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which was part of his wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breaut√© against the government.Carpenter Minority of Henry III pp. 364‚Äì366 In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age.Carpenter Minority of Henry III p. 123 Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229,Weiler Kingship, Rebellion and Political Culture p. 15 with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset.Weiler Kingship, Rebellion and Political Culture p. 147 This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee. Maulay claimed that he only gave up his tenure because of threats by de Burgh.Vincent Peter des Roches pp. 334‚Äì337 Maulay returned to royal service in 1230 when he joined the royal expedition to Brittany and was once more at the royal court in 1232 as a follower of Peter des Roches. Maulay regained Upavon in 1233, after the king reopened the case. Henry justified his action as being exercised \\"per voluntatem nostrum\\", or through his own will. Henry opened a case of quo warranto, and then declined to recognise his own charter as valid, thus granting the manor to Maulay. Although the case could be made that Maulay's right to the manor was better than Basset's, it is more probable that the dispute over Upavon and its ownership was the opening move in an effort to curtail the influence of Richard Marshall, the Earl of Pembroke.Denholm-Young Richard of Cornwall p. 25 It was also an attempt to turn back grants made by the king to de Burgh's supporters, now that de Burgh had fallen from power. The royal actions led to conflict between Henry III and the barons, because of Henry's grant of the manor to Basset. The restoration to Maulay and Basset's deprivation were considered illegal by many of the nobles, and led to a revolt by Basset and Marshal, who was Basset's overlord. Maulay was seen as a non-Englishman who was profiting over a popular English noble, Basset. Maulay was briefly in disgrace but managed to return to favour, and was named constable of Devizes Castle in January 1234, his first royal appointment since 1221.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 425 He was granted the office of Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1236, perhaps owing these offices more to his former ward, Richard of Cornwall, than to his patron des Roches, who fell from power in 1234. Des Roches' loss of power did not adversely affect Maulay's royal service.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 462 Maulay was present at the baptism of Prince Edward, and was one of the nobles who raised the infant from the baptismal font. Last years and legacy Maulay had vowed to go on crusade in 1220, and in 1241 he finally set out for the Holy Land, along with Richard of Cornwall. Maulay died later in 1241, probably while still in the Holy Land. His wife died before him and his heir was his son Peter de Maulay. Besides his heir, Maulay had two other sons ‚Äì Robert and Stephen, and a daughter, Hilary, who married Piers de Brus, son and heir of Piers de Brus, the Lord of Skelton.Sanders English Baronies p. 77 Maulay had endowed a chantry at Meaux Abbey in Yorkshire in memory of his wife. He also confirmed grants of lands to Eskdale Priory, a Grandmontine house founded by Isabella's father,Vincent Peter des Roches p. 38 and footnote 101 and to Nostell Priory.

His participation in the Mexican Army leading to the Battle of Coleto was instrumental in the surrender and demise of Colonel James Fannin and the Texian forces. Early life Carlos was both a Tejano (Mexican born in Texas, or Tejas) and a Labade√±o, or Bade√±o, (a descendant of a Presidio La Bah√≠a soldier). Born in 1807 at the presidio, to soldier Jos√© Antonio de la Garza and his wife Rosalia, the family established a rancho (Mexican ranch) on land owned by Mission La Bah√≠a. Carlos was engaged in the family ranching business and followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the Mexican army. In 1829, he married Tomasita Garc√≠a, with whom he had three children. His Carlos Rancho and his Ferry Crossing at the San Antonio River became a hub for local commerce, as well as a crossroads for several communities of both immigrants and Labade√±os.del la Teja (2010), pp. 195‚Äì196 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) Texas Revolution La Bah√≠a translates as \\"the bay\\". The Presidio was founded in 1721 by the Viceroyality of New Spain on the ruins of the failed French Fort Saint Louis near Matagorda Bay. A year later an adjoining mission was established on Garcitas Creek by Franciscan missionaries in an unsuccessful attempt to convert the Karankawa Indians. Both the presidio and the mission were relocated several times. The last move in 1749 was to what is now Goliad. Mission La Bah√≠a was secularized in 1830.Walter (2007), p. 12 According to historian Alonzo Salazar, many Mexican military families such as the Garzas had established ranchos on the mission lands with the expectation that, should mission lands be secularized, the Mexican government would issue titles to existing homesteaders.del la Teja (2010), pp. 194‚Äì195 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) These longtime homesteaders were passed over by the Spanish and Mexican governments for prominent and wealthier empresarios. Along the Gulf Coast in what are now the counties of Goliad, Refugio, San Patricio and Victoria, Tejano involvement in events of the Texas revolution were partially influenced by the empresario colonization contracts. Over the objections of Mexican rancheros (ranch owners) in the area without legal titles, Irish immigrants James Power and James Hewetson were granted an empresario colonization contract in 1828 (amended in 1831) to settle four hundred Irish families on secularized land once belonging to Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio Mission and Mission La Bah√≠a. When Power and Hewetson failed to settle the required number of families, local rancheros were issued titles as colonists of Power and Hewetson. Garza was able to secure title to a league of his own land only as a colonist of these empresarios. Poyo (1996), pp. 113‚Äì116, \\"Finding Their Way\\" (Ana Carolina Carrillo Crimm). Tejano-Mexican residents of the area were troubled by land speculation of the empresarios, feeling threatened by the influx of the Anglo settlers taking over lands held by their families, many for several generations. With many friends among the settlers, Garza opposed revolution on the grounds that it would strain relations between neighbors.del la Teja (2010), p. 198 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) Presidio commander James Fannin targeted Carlos Rancho under the suspicion of harboring Mexican spies. Private homes were likewise looted under orders from Fannin.del la Teja (2010), p. 199 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) During the events of the Battle of Goliad, rancheros such as Garza offered fleeing Goliad residents food and shelter on their lands. Many ranchers and citizens in the area wanted retaliation. They subsequently organized the Victoriana Guardes as a coalition of Tejanos and Karankawa Indians, employing the fighting skills of Spanish lancers. Garza was chosen as the captain. As scouts for Jos√© de Urrea at the Battle of Coleto, they ran guerilla tactics against Fannin. The Texian surrender at Coleto Creek led to the Palm Sunday Goliad massacre of the captured soldiers. De la Garza, considered and honest broker by both sides, was successful in pleading on behalf of his Anglo neighbors who fought with Fannin in the skirmish; their lives were spared by Lt. Colonel Jos√© Nicol√°s de la Portilla.Tucker (2012), p. 262 The spirit of his defense was returned in kind by his neighbors after the Texian victory at Battle of San Jacinto. The command to slaughter the prisoners of war came directly from General and President of the Centralist Republic of Mexico, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. When Republic of Texas Secretary of War Thomas Jefferson Rusk began reprisals against Mexican Tejanos and Mexican sympathizers, he ordered Garza deported. The order was never successfully carried out due to a defense mounted by Garza's neighbors.del la Teja (2010), p. 202 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) Later life and death Like many Tejanos, in spite Santa Ana's oppressive rule over Texas, de la Garza believed Texas should remain part of Mexico. However after the Texas Revolution, Garza joined the populist call for the U.S Annexation of Texas in 1845. He realized this would be a help in the rule of law and would give Mexican Tejanos many rights which were being suppressed by the Anglo rule in the Republic of Texas. Carlos Rancho survived an 1845 legal attempt by Louisiana resident Thomas Taylor Williamson to seize the land from Garza. Garza died at the age of 75 on December 30, 1882 apparently from an old arrow wound received in a Karankawa Indian fight, possibly in 1852 at Hynes Bay. The arrow wound crippled him for the remainder of his life. Captain Carlos de la Garza is buried at Carlos Rancho; Tomasita, his wife of 53 years, was later buried next to him.del la Teja (2010), p. 205 \\"Don Carlos de La Garza Loyalist Leader\\" (Alonzo Salazar) A portion of the old homestead is still owned by descendants.

She has a master's degree in Hebrew Bible from Yeshiva University. She is married to a rabbi (who serves on Matan's Council of Rabbis) and is called by the term Rabbanit, which is less common in Modern Orthodox circles. Bina does not consider herself a rabbi and, at a 2004 conference of Orthodox Jewish Feminists, emphasized her focus on Talmud study. She was interviewed by JOFA in 2006 and serves on its Council of Advisers. She also pioneered women's reading of Megillat Esther on Purim.  Education  Bina attended a Bais Yaakov school in Baltimore where she did not study Mishna or Gemara. Immediately after the Six Day War Bina went to Israel to attend the Jerusalem Michlala, where she studied Mishna, ‚Äúand felt that it was a pity not to further expand my learning, now that I had been given a taste of the subject. I also thought that I would learn Gemara in the future. If it was available, why shouldn‚Äôt women do it?‚Äù After meeting her husband, Rabbi Aharon Bina and moving to America, Bina completed a Masters program in Bible and History at Revel at Yeshiva University in 1972. It was in this program that she learned various sugyot of Gemara.  MaTaN  Rabbanit Bina is the Founder and Director of MaTaN, an innovative institution dedicated to furthering women's Torah study, paving the way for them to learn Talmud, Tanakh and Halakha at the highest levels, in a vibrant atmosphere that is open to diverse spiritual and intellectual perspectives. She says, ‚ÄúMy goal was to open up an institution B‚ÄùH that would welcome any woman who wanted to come to study. The dream was not just to provide adult education for women, including high level Talmud studies, but to create a strong beit midrash that would be a wellspring for future female religious leaders...We wanted the learning at MaTaN to be a mainstream activity for post high school religious women who would devote themselves to Torah Lishma (Torah for its own sake), not necessarily for a degree. I consider that it took 10 years for MaTaN to become mainstream and no longer be peripheral. Originally there were 4 to 6 women in the beit midrash. Now we have 22 women in a three-year Talmud program, and 20 in the Tanakh program. These are women from other areas of study who spend between one to three years at MaTaN...The emphasis at MaTaN is on study as a religious act, but always combined with high intellectual goals...At MaTaN we try to stress that learning should be new and fresh and exciting every day‚Äîthe stress on hayom (today).‚Äù On August 1 while 90,000 Jews celebrated Siyum HaShas, the completion of the daily learning of the entire Gemara, at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium ‚Äúa significantly smaller, but just as intriguing group celebrated the event in skirts, scarves and a spirit of sisterhood in Jerusalem.‚Äù The group of women were from MaTaN and Rabbanit Bina told the Jewish Press, ‚ÄúBaruch Hashem, we were able to finish the Shas‚Ä¶ There were 15 completers for Siyum HaShas from Matan, about 30 women from all over Israel‚Ä¶some of the women were crying...It was beautiful. .‚Äù Rabbi Mike Feuer, Educational Director of Yeshivat Sulam Yaakov in Nachlaot, told the Jewish Press, ‚Äú[Teaching women Torah] is definitely not the definition of the issur (prohibition] any longer‚Ä¶The world has shifted...This just needs to happen ‚Äì it‚Äôs not forbidden even if it may not be recommended traditionally... I see a place like Matan as trying to carve out a space of respect for women‚Äôs Torah‚Ä¶ The playing field on which men win each other‚Äôs respect is the Gemara, and this is the expression of old school feminism, which is that a woman ought to be able to do what a man does.‚Äù When asked why women should study Talmud Bina Responded, ‚ÄúWhy not? It‚Äôs an integral part of what Torah is ‚Äì the written law and the oral law. You write and you speak, why shouldn‚Äôt we be active participants in the oral law? It‚Äôs not logical...In earlier times, when women were less educated, and socioeconomy didn‚Äôt permit, it wouldn‚Äôt fit in with what was happening in the big picture of the world. But the world is changing...Torah also wasn‚Äôt permitted, until Rav Shimshon Refael Hirsch and the Chofetz Chaim opened it up for women. That led to the opening of the Beis Yaakov movement‚Ä¶ Now oral law has become available.‚Äù  JOFA  Bina is on the Advisory Council of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, a grassroots non-profit organization established in 1997 to educate and advocate for women's increased participation in Orthodox Jewish life and to create a community for women and men dedicated to such change. Bina was interviewed by Rachelle Isserow in an article entitled ‚ÄúCreating New Leaders: Interview with Malke Bina, Founder and Director of MaTaN‚Äù which was published in The JOFA Journal of the Winter of 2006. In the interview Bina discussed how and why MaTaN was founded, its mission, and its plan for the future.

The first prototype was destroyed in a fatal crash only a few weeks after its first flight and no more were constructed. Design and development In 1958 France was in the middle of the Algerian War and felt a need for a counter-insurgency aircraft capable of observation, photography and ground support. This official programme led to three aircraft: the SIPA S.1100, the Sud Aviation SE.116 Voltigeur and, slightly later the Dassault Spirale. All three were propeller driven designs with twin engines, though the SIPA was the only one never fitted with turboprops. The SIPA SE.1100 was a low wing cantilever monoplane.

Its Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp nine cylinder radial engines were mounted ahead of the wing leading edges, with cowlings which extended rearwards, both above and below the wing, nearly to the trailing edge. Its main wheels retracted backwards into the lower cowling and the tail wheel also retracted. Its crew compartment was in the extreme nose of a deepened forward fuselage, with multiple transparencies to provide good sideways and downward vision. For ground support work it was fitted with two guns. There were underwing attachment points for other armament packages. Ten SE.1100 prototypes were ordered but then cancelled before the SE.1100's first flight, flown on 24 April 1958 by Pierre Ponthus. Less than three months later, Ponthus and his colleague Andr√© Bouthonnet were killed and the aircraft destroyed when it crashed at Villacoublay during a low level demonstration. The unfinished second prototype was then abandoned.

He designed Lime Street railway station and the original Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool. Life Cunningham lived in a flat at 15 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh The grave of John Cunningham, Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh Born in 1799 in the Scottish village of Leitholm, Berwickshire, he was the son of a builder to whom he was initially apprenticed. His talent came to the attention of Sir William Purves- Hume-Campbell, the Sixth Baronet and Third Earl of Marchmont. He designed his first building aged 17, a lodge for the Marchmont Estate. In 1819, Cunningham was apprenticed to Thomas Brown, Edinburgh's Superintendent of Works, and remained in that city for 10 years. In 1829 he designed Greenlaw's Greek Revival County Hall and Courts building, which was constructed with money supplied by Purves-Hume Campbell. In 1832/3 he is noted as living at 15 Buccleuch Place, a flat in the south side of Edinburgh. In 1833, he married Agnes Usher. That same year, his patron Purves-Hume-Campbell died, and Cunningham and his wife moved to New York, possibly to find work. However, the climate there had a detrimental effect on his health, and he returned to Edinburgh in 1834. On his return he was commissioned to design the Castle Inn Hotel in Greenlaw, which was situated directly across from the County Hall. Later that year, he was invited to Liverpool by Samuel Holme, a politician and builder. In Liverpool Cunningham formed an informal partnership with Holme's brother Arthur Hill Holme, which lasted until 1840. During that time the two men collaborated to design the Liverpool Lime Street railway station. Cunningham was elected as a fellow of the Geological Society of London on 6 February 1839. He had a lifelong interest in geology and fossils, traveling to see the fossil tracks at Storeton as well as being a regular contributor to the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society. In 1842, Cunningham took a trip through Belgium and France with Samuel Holme. During the trip he contracted cholera, but managed to recuperate. A building of his design, the Jacobethan Sailors' Home, opened in Liverpool in 1850. In 1860 he formed a partnership with the brothers George Ashdown Audsley and William Audsley of W. & G. Audsley. The partnership was terminated when the brothers opted to become independent in 1863. Cunningham retired and left Liverpool in the summer of 1873, returning to Edinburgh and settling in the Trinity district, in order to live closer to his family and friends. There, he began a design for the St Andrews Public Halls, assisted by Campbell Douglas and James Sellars. However, before the building could be completed, he died at Laverockbank Terrace in Trinity on 2 October 1873 at the age of 73. His obituary ran in The Builder on 18 October. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery close to his final home. The grave lies on the main west path on its east side at the transition between the upper and lower sections. His last project was finished posthumously by Campbell Douglas and James Sellars in 1875. Family In 1833 he married Agnes Usher (d.1896). His son, John Usher Cunningham, was born on 16 February 1839. Other sons included George Playfair Cunningham (1837-1867) and William Russell Cunningham (1835-1878).Grave of John Cunningham, Warriston Cemetery Works The Greenlaw County Hall A number of the buildings he designed in Liverpool have since been demolished, but many in Scotland still stand.

Horst emigrated to the U.S. as a child in 1874 from Tuttlingen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. In the mid 1880s he purchased a small plot of land along the Bear River, near Wheatland, California, and began cultivating hops. He soon bought out two other hop growers, Hugh Roddan and Joseph M.C. Jasper. By 1898, Horst's operation had grown to the point that ten hop drying kilns ran daily during the harvest and a company town, large enough to have its own post office, was started on the ranch to support the thousands of migrant workers who picked the mature hops each year. Given the significance of Horst's ranch, certain loamy floodplain soils found in the area were later named after him. Horst married in 1898, and moved to San Francisco in 1902. By 1904 he was supplying Oregon hops to the Guinness Brewery in Ireland. By 1912, Horst owned the largest number of acres of hops under cultivation in the world with offices in Chicago, New York and London. Horst Company was headquartered at 150 Pine Street, San Francisco, California.http://irishancestryresearch.com/doc/Horst_ancestry_report.pdf Prior to World War II, Horst Company was the only exporter of hops to Germany. Labor Conditions, Mechanization and Unrest In 1886, labor shortages and threats of a strike by white workers had become serious; hop growers founded the California Hop Growers‚Äô Association, and hired Chinese workers. Simultaneously hop labor camp conditions had become \\"unspeakably bad throughout the state and the pay was equally abysmal\\" so that by 1899 the Horst Brothers neighboring Durst Ranch's 300 white and a number of Japanese employees quit and went on strike for more pay. To recruit workers Durst launched advertising campaigns not only by making false promises but advertised for at least twice as many workers than they actually needed, with the goal to play one group off against the other, as he admitted before the U.S. Immigration Commission. Horst revolutionized the processing of hops with the invention of his mechanical hop separator, patented 1909 in Elk Grove, California. It picked the hops while discarding the bine and leaves. It produced 25 bales of hops in one day, while an experienced worker picked just two bales in a week, allowing him to bypass the hassles of hiring seasonal labor. Horst continuously invented new hop-related machinery (1884‚Äì1924) holding at least 14 patents. In the first season that Horst used the new machine, he advertised and kept hop pickers on hand, in case anything went wrong. When the separator proved itself and the pickers were told that there would be no work, the workers went on strike and blocked access to the kilns, halting the harvest. The harvesting process was further developed in 1939 (US Patent #2139046) by his son-in-law, Edouard Thys, founder of Thys Company which, among other industrial parts, manufactured the parts for the portable hop picking machine. Hop production peaked between 1912 and 1916 and plummeted thereafter. On 3 August 1913 the Durst Ranch became the site of the Wheatland Hop Riot. Until 2009, when Google released a digitized version of the 1916 Commission on Industrial Relations, the Horstville ranch was often confused with the neighboring Durst Ranch. A film produced between 1900 and 1910 entitled Horst Hop Ranch, depicts the processing of hops and their shipment to market.

History After the electoral triumph of Catalan Solidarity in the elections of 1907, contacts between the opposition forces increased in Galicia for the establishment of a political force that would bring together all the sectors opposed to the turnista system and to caciquismo. Autonomy for Galicia was the other main goal of Galician Solidarity. In the summer of 1907, 44 people have signed the Manifesto Solidario, which gave rise to Galician Solidarity. Among the founders of Solidarity were the republicans led by Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠nez, federal republicans led by Segundo Moreno Barcia, traditionalists led by Juan V√°zquez de Mella and the regionalists led by Manuel Murgu√≠a, Galo Salinas and Ux√≠o Carr√©. The opposition towards caciquismo and support for agricultural associations were the main pillars of the organization. Under the patronage of Galician Solidarity, 400 agrarian societies were formed, although in 1911 only 85 remained affiliated with SG. In the municipal elections of 1909 SG obtained 258 town councilors in the province of A Coru√±a (absolute majority in 12 municipalities), but the differences between the members and currents of the organization prevented their consolidation. In the municipal elections of 1910 obtained bad results. Press Solidarismo Gallego was the official newspaper of SG, published for the first time in December 1907. On April 16, 1908, Solidarismo Gallego was replaced by the weekly Solidaridad Gallega, also directed by Rodrigo Sanz and disappeared in 1911 or 1912. The republican and leftist faction edited Galicia Solidaria between 1907 and 1908. Factions * Republicans: this faction was formed mainly by urban and left- wing people, specially by the members of the Republican Union Party. The republican faction was very strong in A Coru√±a and Ferrolterra. * Federal Republicans: this faction was formed by left-wing federalists that were influenced by the ideas of Francesc Pi i Margall. The majority of federal republicans wanted to create a Galician State in a Federal Spanish Republic. The majority of them were organized in the Federal Democratic Republican Party. This faction was very strong in Lugo and Ferrolterra. * Traditionalist: this faction was formed by carlists and conservative Catholics. Most of them were organized in the Carlist Party. This faction was strong in Santiago. * Regionalists: this faction was formed by mainly liberal regionalists. Their main leaders were Manuel Murgu√≠a and Eugenio Carr√© Aldao. They're main goal was the autonomy of Galiza. This faction was strong in the city of A Coru√±a, were a lot of the members of the Galician League had joined SG. * Agrarianists: this faction was composed of agrarianist activist of the rural areas. Some of them would later join Acci√≥n Gallega. This factions supported the creation of agrarian associations and agrarian unions. The agrarianist also wanted to end the foros, an amount of money that the galician peasants had to pay to the owners of their land (mainly low nobility, the church and rich farmers).

A variable pitch fan is similar in concept to that of a variable-pitch propeller and involves progressively reducing the pitch (or blade angle) of the fan on a turbofan as the engine is throttled. Although no production engine uses such a feature, it is highly likely that it will be required on at least some of the next generation of high bypass ratio turbofans. One of the methods used to reduce Thrust-specific fuel consumption is to improve Propulsive Efficiency. This involves reducing the effective jet velocity of the engine by reducing specific thrust. This, in turn, reduces the optimum fan pressure ratio required and consequently the cold nozzle pressure ratio. At cruise flight speeds the nozzle is choked and the fan working line is fairly steep and linear. However, at low flight speeds the ram pressure rise in the air intake is so low the nozzle is well un-choked. Consequently the fan working line is highly curved and well to the left of the cruise flight speed working line, potentially reducing the fan surge margin to a dangerous level particularly at lower throttle settings. Readers unfamiliar with surge lines, working lines, etc. should read the Wikipedia article on Compressor map. There are two solutions to this problem: 1) Open up the cold nozzle area at low flight speeds, which moves the fan working line away from surge. This has little effect on the position or slope of the surge line. OR 2) Make the effective surge line of the fan shallower by progressively reducing the pitch of the fan as the engine is throttled. As the pitch is reduced the fan map contracts in terms of both mass flow and pressure ratio, with the surge line moving to the left and downwards. All of this has little effect on the slope and position of the fan operating line NASA Technical Paper 1502, Typical Variable Pitch Fan Maps, P62:https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19790023042. One advantage of the variable fan option is that varying the fan pitch offers the possibility of reversing engine thrust without the need for heavy blocker doors, cascades, etc. The pitch of the fan can be reversed through Feather as with the Turbomeca Astafan.FlightGlobal/Archivearticle:http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200931.html?search=Astafan or through Fine Pitch as employed in the Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45SD-02.FlightGlobal/Archivearticle:http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201027.html?search=M45SD-02FlightGlobal/Archivearticle:http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200130.html? search=M45SD-02 With reverse thrust engaged, the air for the fan typically enters the engine through an auxiliary intake formed by a longitudinal gap which is exposed near the cold nozzle exit plane. The bulk of this air is expelled through the normal air intake thus providing a force resisting forward motion. However, the remaining air has to undertake some sort of U-turn so that it can enter the engine core (i.e. gas generator) to provide the energy to drive the fan. Normally a low specific thrust turbofan would have an ultra high bypass ratio and be fitted with a reduction gearbox between the fan and the LP shaft to allow the IP compressor and LP turbine to operate at a much higher rotational speed than the fan to reduce the number of stages required in these multi-stage devices. Rolls-Royce are currently developing the Ultrafan which employs much of what is described above. www.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Trent#UltraFan www.https://aviationweek.com/ad-week/test-progress-keeps-ultrafan-demo-track- run-2021 www.https://youtube.com/watch?v=h9zVok5qsS8 In the 1980s the General Electric GE36 Unducted Fan (UDF), which actually flew on a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, employed two rows of contra-rotating variable pitch fan blades, albeit without any fan casing because it was a prop-fan engine.

Designed by John B. Snook in 1871 using cast-iron in mixed Italianate and French Second Empire style, it was completed in 1872 for the Stephen Storm estate. The landmark, which ‚Äúgraphically illustrates the transformation of lower Broadway in the 19th century from a residential boulevard into the city‚Äôs commercial center‚Äù, was leaning approximately by 2008. History Attorney William Alexander owned the site as early as 1794, when it contained a dwelling and carriage house. The house was purchased by Elbert Anderson in 1816 who demolished it two years later, and built a commercial building in 1819. In 1821, Storm purchased the property. With others, he built the Irving House Hotel in 1848‚Äì49. In 1871, Storm's estate hired Snook to design a commercial building to be used for banking and office space. The Union Pacific Railroad Company was an early tenant, as was Henry Bischoff & Company. The Gindi family purchased the property in 1969. Already tilted , it began to lead an additional in 2007 during excavation work at 57 Reade Street, forcing the city government to vacate it. In 2013, 287 Broadway was purchased for US$8 million by the Laboz family's United American Land company which affirmed the structural stability of the building and began a renovation for ground-floor retail space and residential rental lofts on the higher floors. After years of lobbying led by Margot Gayle and her group Friends of Cast-iron Architecture, 287 Broadway was designated a landmark on August 29, 1989. At the designation hearing it was described as one of the few surviving examples in New York City of a cast-iron building designed in mixed Italianate and French Second Empire architecture styles. Architecture and fittings The six-story building is of mixed Italianate and French Second Empire architectural style. The fa√ßade is of cast-iron and the slat shingles are original to the building, which also features a mansard roof, dormers, segmented pediments, round-arched windows, Otis elevator, as well as Ionic and Corinthian columns. Steel shoring was added in 2008 against the south facade, replacing timber bracing added in 2007 following excavation work at 57 Reade Street.

He entered Jangan Temple(Èï∑ÂÆâÂØ∫) in the Diamond Mountains of present-day North Korea, and his guiding sunim was Haengl≈≠m K≈≠mw≈èl. Some time later he left there to continue his studies at Singye Temple(Á•ûÊ∫™ÂØ∫). After several years, he came across a passage by the Koryo Dynasty Seon Master, Bojo Jinul, in Secrets on Cultivating the Mind: This precipitated his first enlightenment experience, in 1899. The essence of that passage, \\"don't search for the Buddha outside of yourself,\\" stayed with Hanam Sunim throughout his life. After Hanam Sunim's first enlightenment experience, he made his way south to Sudo Hermitage,9 he met Ky≈èngh≈è Sunim.10 Meeting Hanam Sunim, Ky≈èngh≈è Sunim quoted the following phrase from the Diamond Sutra: Upon hearing this, Hanam Sunim experienced a second enlightenment, and \\"felt that the whole universe could be seen in one glance and whatever was to be heard or seen was nothing other than that which was within himself.\\" He composed the following poem: From 1899 to 1903, Hanam Sunim spent the retreat seasons either studying under Ky≈èngh≈è Sunim or attending retreat seasons at other meditation halls in the region. They spent the summer retreat season of 1903 together at Haein Temple, and later that fall, Ky≈èngh≈è Sunim headed north by himself. He died in 1912. 1904-1912 In 1904, at the age of 29, Hanam Sunim became the head of the meditation hall at Tongdo Temple(ÈÄöÂ∫¶ÂØ∫). However, in 1910, while studying a scripture, he came across a passage that he himself didn't fully understand. The next day he ordered the meditation hall closed and made his way to Udu Hermitage near Maeng-san district in Py≈èngan-do (in the northwestern area of present-day North Korea) in order to continue his practice. He stayed in that area until at least 1912. One day, while starting a fire, Hanam Sunim had his third enlightenment experience, and composed the following poems: 1912-1926 Very little is known about this time in Hanam Sunim's life. As the Maeng-san district is only 70-80 kilometers south of the Myohyang Mountains, it's probable that Hanam Sunim spent time at different temples there. The Myohyang Mountains are large mountainous area in the far north of Korea, and at the time were a major Buddhist center, with several large, important temples and many smaller hermitages. Given Hanam Sunim's reputation as a disciple of Gyeongheo, and his time as head of the meditation hall at Tongdo Temple, it would not be unusual for the sunims in this area to ask him to fulfill a similar role. A well-known saying of \\"Mangong in the south, Hanam in the north\\" may date from this time. (At the time, Mangong Sunim was at Sudeok Temple, which is about 1.5 hours south of Seoul by car.) Hanam Sunim was in the Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922,\\"S≈ènjung banghamlokso\\" (Address to the Assembly of Sunims at K≈ènbongTemple), Pang, 1996, p. 335. and later just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps intending to return to the Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This would have been on his path to the Diamond Mountains.) As he was a very well known teacher, it seems likely that the monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, had asked him to stay and teach. 1926-1951 Hanam Sunim was famous for the diligence of his spiritual practice, and it is often said that during the last 25 years of his life he never once left his temple, Sangwon Temple, in the Odae Mountains. Many people, hearing of this, assume that it was because of his spiritual practice that he wouldn't leave. However, a close examination of Hanam Sunim's letters reveals that he actually did leave the Odae Mountains at least twice between 1926 and 1933. What kept him there in later years appears to have been his responsibility for the sunims practicing in the Odae mountains, combined with his ill-health. Hanam Sunim repeatedly refused to go to Seoul, where he would have been at the bidding of the Japanese government, and it seems that people confused this as a desire to stay in the Odae Mountains. In a conversation with the Japanese Superintendent of Police, Hanam Sunim plainly states that he'd gone to Seoul to visit a dentist, and south to see Bulguk Temple.Yamashita, Jinichi Â±±‰∏ã Áúû‰∏Ä 1934. \\"Ikeda-kiyoshi keibu kyokuch≈ç wo H≈çkangan zenji fu h≈ç (Ê±†Áî∞Ê∑∏Ë≠¶ÂãôÂ±ÄÈï∑„ÇíÊñπÊº¢Â∑ñÁ¶™Â∏´„ÅµË®™: Police Superintendent Ikeda-kiyoshi visits S≈èn Master Pang Hanam).\\" Ch≈çsen bukky≈ç (ÊúùÈÆÆ‰ΩõÊïé) 101: 4-5. This was confirmed by his long-time correspondent, Kyeongbong Sunim, who living nearby at Tongdo Temple, recorded in his diary that Hanma Sunim visited him for several days before returning to the Odae Mountains.S≈èk,My≈èngj≈èng,Èáã ÊòéÊ≠£ ed. 1992 Samsogul ilji (‰∏âÁ¨ëÁ™ü Êó•Ë™å: Samsogul Diary). South Korea: K≈≠ngnak s≈ènw≈èn, 102-104.(c.f. Chong Go 2007: 75) During this time, he was frequently elected to high leadership positions within Korean Buddhism, usually without his consent. In 1929 he was elected one of the seven patriarchs of Korean Buddhism during the Grand Assembly of Korean Buddhist Monks(Chos≈èn Pulgyo s≈≠ngny≈è taehoe). He was elected as vice chairman of the meditation society, S≈èn hakw≈èn in 1934, and in 1936 he was elected as the Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye Order, and again in 1941, when it was reorganized. He resigned in 1945, but was again elected in 1948 and asked to serve as Supreme Patriarch. (Chong Go 2008: 124) Death Hanam Sunim is perhaps most popularly known for the events leading up to his death. During the Korean War, a Chinese army offensive broke through the UN lines in January 1951 and was rapidly advancing south. The South Korean army was ordered to burn all of the buildings in the Odae Mountains in order to deny shelter to the advancing Chinese troops. WolJeong Temple could be seen burning when a squad of South Korean soldiers arrived at Sangwon Temple. Explaining their mission, they ordered everyone to pack what they could and leave immediately. Instead, Hanam Sunim returned to the Dharma Hall, put on his formal robe, and, sitting down, told the lieutenant to go ahead and burn the buildings. Hanam Sunim then told the lieutenant that his since his job was to stay with the temple, and the lieutenant's was to burn it, there would be no conflict(or bad karma) because they were both just doing their job. The lieutenant couldn't get Hanam Sunim to leave, and so at great risk to himself (for disobeying orders in wartime) he instead piled all of the wooden doors and window shutters in the courtyard and burned those instead. In this way, Sangwon Temple was one of the few temples in this area to survive the war. Hanam Sunim died two months later, on March 21, 1951, following a brief illness. Teachings Hanam Sunim was known for the diligence with which he upheld the traditional precepts for a Buddhist monk, along with the sincerity of his practice. As the head of the meditation hall at Sangwon Temple(‰∏äÈô¢ÂØ∫), he had monks study sutras and learn ceremonies during the meditation retreat. This was unprecedented, but he explained that such long periods of meditation were actually the most appropriate times to study those things. He also said that monks should be adept at five things: Meditation, chanting, understanding the sutras, performing any needed ceremonies, and maintaining and protecting the temple. (See also Ulmann, 2010, for more about this.) He was also quite flexible in his approach to hwadus(koans) and the meditation method known as silent illumination, emphasizing that neither method was inherently better or worse than the other. Instead it came down to which was best suited to the student. Hwadu/koan, reflective illumination, and chanting Hanam Sunim didn't particularly discriminate between the different methods of Buddhist spiritual practice. For example, in an article titled \\"21 Seon Questions and Answers,\\" he gave several examples of how great Seon masters of the past had used both Hwadus and Reflective Illumination to teach different disciples, and in \\"Five Things that Sunims Should Practice,\\" he explained how reciting the name of Buddha could lead to the state that transcended the discriminating consciousness, and thus lead to awakening. In general, Hanam Sunim's view of spiritual practice seems to be one of \\"Skillful Means,\\" rather than absolute methods. For example, in \\"21 Seon Questions and Answers,\\" when he was asked about which hwadus were best to practice with, before going on to give a detailed explanation of traditional hwadu practice, Hanam Sunim first replied, Cause and effect/karma Many of the monks who knew Hanam Sunim commented on his strong faith in the teachings of cause and effect. This belief is seen numerous places in his writings. Zingmark relates the following stories that convey a sense of Hanam Sunim's faith in cause and effect: On February 22, 1947, two junior monks were studying in a small building within the Sangw≈èn Temple compound. They left a candle burning when they went outside, and this was the cause of the fire that burned down the entire temple. However, when Hanam Sunim describes the fire to Ky≈èngbong Sunim he didn‚Äôt blame anyone specifically. Instead, he attributes the fire to the workings of cause and effect in which he and everyone else at the temple played a role: Between 1945 and 1950, there were increasing conflicts within the Jogye Order between the monks who had married during the Japanese occupation and those monks who had kept the traditional precepts. The tone of these conflicts was increasingly strident and there were even incidences of violence. These events led Hanam Sunim to issue a statement in the fall of 1949 saying that all of these problems should be solved harmoniously. Hanam Sunim alludes to these problems in his 23rd letter to Ky≈èngbong Sunim: In addition to his own belief in cause and effect, Hanam Sunim(in his second letter) also warns Ky≈èngbong Sunim to be cautious of others who ignore cause and effect.

Geology The geology of the area in which the Green Bridge of Wales is located is composed of a very thick layer of Carboniferous Limestone, including a certain amount of chert. Erosion has occurred over time as storm winds have battered the coast, pebbles have been dashed against the rocks, sand particles have worn away the surface, and chemical erosion has dissolved the limestone. The weakest parts of the cliff are the first to be worn away, usually the folds and small faults that are present in the rocks. This has resulted over many millennia in the creation of many unusual landforms. In the case of the Green Bridge of Wales, erosion has taken place on both sides of a small headland, caves have been formed which extended further and further until they met, forming the arch that can be seen today. The bridge is about high with a span of more than . Its outer edge rests on a more durable rock pedestal and its upper surface is clad in vegetation.

The Mongols, led by Qutlugh Khwaja, invaded India, intending to conquer Delhi. When they encamped at Kili near Delhi, the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji led an army to check their advance. Alauddin's general Zafar Khan attacked a Mongol unit led by Hijlak without Alauddin's permission. The Mongols tricked Zafar Khan into following them away from Alauddin's camp, and then ambushed his unit. Before he died, Zafar Khan managed to inflict heavy casualties on the Mongol army. The Mongols decided to retreat after two days.  Background  The Delhi Sultanate was ruled by Alauddin Khalji, who had taken the throne of Delhi after assassinating his uncle in 1296. The Chagatai Khanate controlled Central Asia, and its leader since the 1280s was Duwa Khan who was second in command of Kaidu. Duwa was active in Afghanistan, and attempted to extend Mongol rule into India. Negudari governor Abdullah, who was a son of Chagatai Khan's great grandson, invaded Punjab with his force in 1292, but their advance guard under Ulghu was defeated and taken prisoner by Alauddin's predecessor Jalaluddin Khalji. Around 4,000 Mongol soldiers (called Mughals in Delhi) who surrendered converted to Islam. The suburb they lived in was appropriately named Mughalpura. Chagatai tumens were beaten by the Delhi Sultanate several times in 1296-1297. The Mongols thereafter repeatedly invaded northern India. On at least two occasions, they came in strength. During Alauddin's reign, the Mongol noyan Kadar raided Punjab in the winter of 1297-98. He was defeated and forced to retreat by Alauddin's general Ulugh Khan. A second Mongol invasion led by Saldi was foiled by Alauddin's general Zafar Khan. After this humiliating defeat, the Mongols launched a third invasion, with full preparations, intending to conquer India.  The Mongol march  In late 1299, Duwa, the ruler of the Mongol Chagatai Khanate, dispatched his son Qutlugh Khwaja to conquer Delhi. The Mongols intended to conquer and govern the Delhi Sultanate, not merely raid it. Therefore, during their 6-month long march to India, they did not resort to plundering cities and destroying forts. During the nights, they were harassed by the Delhi generals deployed at frontier posts such as Multan and Samana. The Mongols wanted to conserve their energy for the battle to conquer Delhi, and avoided confrontations with these generals. Alauddin's general Zafar Khan, who was at Kuhram, sent a messenger and invited Qutlugh Khwaja to a battle. However, the invader refused the offer, declaring that \\"kings only fight kings\\". He asked Zafar to fight under the banner of his master Alauddin at Delhi. The Mongols encamped at Kili, a place located around 10 km from the suburbs of Delhi. As the news of their arrival reached the surrounding area, people from the adjoining areas started moving to the safety of the fortified city of Delhi. The streets, the markets, and the mosques of the city became overcrowded. The merchant caravans headed for Delhi were interrupted by the Mongols. As a result, the commodity prices in Delhi increased greatly, causing distress to the local public.  Alauddin's preparations  Alauddin seems to have received the news of Mongol invasion only after the invaders had crossed the Indus River. According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, he had only 1‚Äì2 weeks to prepare for the battle. He immediately sent messages to the various provincial governors, asking them to send reinforcements to Delhi. Alauddin set up a military camp near Siri, on the banks of the Yamuna River, and summoned his officers. Alaul Mulk, his uncle and the kotwal of Delhi, advised him to resort to diplomacy and negotiations, instead of risking his kingdom. Alauddin rejected the advice, arguing that if he showed weakness, the general public and the warriors will lose their respect for him. He publicly announced his intention to march to Kili and fight with the Mongols. Alauddin left Alaul Malik in charge of Delhi, ordering him to hand over the keys of the palace gates to the victor of the battle. After Alauddin departed for Siri, Alaul Mulk closed all the gates of Delhi except the Badaun Gate. The Badaun Gate was kept open for flight to the Doab, in case of Alauddin's defeat.  The armies   Mongol army  The 14th century writer Ziauddin Barani gives the strength of the Mongol army as 100,000 at one place in his chronicle, and as 200,000 at another place. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena finds this figure doubtful, arguing that it would have been hard for Qutlugh Khwaja to find provisions for such a large army during its journey to India. The Mongol army was organized into four major divisions: # The left wing, commanded by Hijlak (or Hajlak) # The centre wing, commanded by Qutlugh Khwaja # The right wing, commanded by Tamar Bugha # A unit of 10,000 soldiers hiding in ambush, commanded by Targhi Other officers in the Mongol army included Isakilba, Kijya and Utna.  Delhi army  According to the 16th century historian Firishta, the Delhi army included 300,000 horses and 2,700 elephants. Historian Kishori Saran Lal finds this figure inflated. The Delhi army was organized into five major divisions: # The left wing, commanded by Nusrat Khan # The right wing, commanded by Hizabruddin Zafar Khan and supported by the Hindu warriors # The centre unit, commanded by Alauddin Khalji # A unit commanded by Akat Khan, placed in front of Alauddin's unit # A unit commanded by Ulugh Khan, placed at the back of Nusrat Khan's unit for reinforcements 22 elephants were stationed in front of each division to act as a buffer against the Mongol assault. The Delhi army stretched over several miles, making it difficult for Alauddin to control it centrally. Therefore, he issued a strict order that no officer was to move from their position without his instructions: the punishment for the violation of this order would be beheading. The 14th century chronicler Isami mentions that before the battle, Qutlugh Khwaja sent four envoys to Alauddin, declaring that such an army was unprecedented in Hindustan. He requested Alauddin to allow his envoys to go around the Delhi army's camp, and inquire the names of his chief officers. Alauddin granted his permission, and the envoys reported back to Qutlugh Khwaja.  The Battle  The battle site at Kili was bounded by the Yamuna River on one side, and a bushland on the other.  Zafar khan's death  Alauddin had relatively little time to prepare for the battle, and therefore, he wanted to delay the battle. He expected more units to arrive from the east. He also hoped that a delay would cause the already-tired Mongols to fall short of provisions, and retreat. However, Alauddin's general Zafar Khan attacked Hijlak's unit without Alauddin's permission. Hijlak's unit feigned retreat, which was a common Mongol strategy. Zafar Khan followed the enemy soldiers rapidly, causing his foot soldiers to be left behind. Even his cavalry had trouble keeping up with his pace. After following Hijlak's army for 18 karohs (approximately 55 km), he realized that he had only 1,000 horsemen left with him. Meanwhile, Targhi's Mongol unit had covered an area of 3 km behind him, blocking his return to Alauddin's camp. Alauddin did not send any unit in his support. According to the 17th century historian Hajiuddabir's Zafarul-vali, Ulugh Khan maintained an ill-will against Zafar Khan, and therefore, did not lead his reinforcement division to support Zafar Khan. Zafar Khan consulted his officers Usman Akhur-beg, Usman Yaghan, Ali Shah Rana-i-Pil, and others. They realized that they would not be able to return, and even if they did, Alauddin would punish them for not following his orders and for cowardice. Therefore, they decided to die fighting. According to Ziauddin Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Qutlugh Khwaja offered Zafar an opportunity to surrender, promising to take him to the Chagatai Khanate, where he would be treated more honourably than at the Delhi court. However, Zafar Khan refused this offer. According to Isami, Zafar Khan and his companions managed to kill 5,000 Mongols, while losing only 800. After this, Zafar Khan put up a last stand with his 200 surviving soldiers. After his horse was cut down, he fought on foot, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Hijlak. He was killed by an arrow that bypassed his armour and pierced his heart.  The Mongol retreat  Zafar Khan's son Diler Khan also led a charge against the Mongols, forcing Tamar Bugha to fall back. He pursued the retreating Mongol army, whose soldiers showered arrows as they retreated. The Mongols also launched an attack at the centre of the Delhi army, which was repulsed by Alauddin's division, leading to the death of a large number of Mongol soldiers. Zafar Khan's death had also caused despair among the Delhi officers. The next morning, Alauddin's officers advised him to retreat to Delhi, and fight from the security of the fort. Alauddin rejected the advice, arguing that Zafar Khan's unit had suffered because of their disobedience. He declared that if he had to move, he would only move forward. Meanwhile, Qutlugh Khwaja remained reluctant to initiate an attack, and the second day ended without any military action. The third day also ended without any warfare, and at night, the Mongols retreated towards their homeland. Alauddin allowed them to retreat safely, and then returned to Delhi. According to Barani, Zafar Khan's attack had caused terror among the Mongols, which was the reason for their retreat. However, the real reason for the Mongol retreat appears to be that Qutlugh Khwaja was seriously wounded: he died during the return journey.  Aftermath  Although Zafar Khan died fighting in the battle, Alauddin resented the fact that he had disobeyed the royal orders. Nobody in the royal court praised his gallantry; on the contrary, Alauddin denounced his recklessness and disobedience. Zafar Khan's name was omitted in the subsequent royal chronicles written during Alauddin's reign. For example, Amir Khusrau's Khazainul Futuh makes no mention of him. The Mongols invaded India again in 1303, 1305, and 1306, but failed to defeat the Delhi Sultanate army.

Three were built but no series production was undertaken. Design and development In 1958 France was in the middle of the Algerian War and felt a need for a counter-insurgency aircraft capable of observation, photography and ground support. This official programme led to three aircraft: the SIPA S.1100, the Sud Aviation SE-116 Voltigeur and, slightly later, the Dassault Spirale. All three were propeller driven designs with twin engines. Orinally known as the Fonceur, the Voltigeur was named after the French cavalry units specialising in skirmishes. It was a low wing cantilever monoplane. All its flying surfaces were straight tapered and square tipped; the vertical tail was tall and broad. The first prototype had Wright Cyclone nine cylinder radial engines mounted ahead of the wing leading edges, with cowlings, largely above the wing, projecting beyond the trailing edge. On the second prototype the Cyclones were replaced with Turbomeca Bastan turboprops in much more slender cowlings on the top of the wings. The Voltigeur had tricycle gear with main legs that retracted backwards into under-engine cowlings; the nose wheel retracted into the fuselage. Each main leg carried a pair of wheels to assist with take-offs and landings on rough strips. The Voltigeur had a conventional, multi-panel, glazed cabin and a glazed nose offering good ground views. Behind the wing trailing edge the fuselage carried perforated airbrakes for ground attacks; the Voltigeur was fitted with two guns and six underwing attachment points for bombs and rockets. The piston- engined Voltigeur was first flown on 5 June 1958 by Roger Carpentier who also took the turboprop version on its first flight on 15 December 1958. A few weeks later, on 9 January 1959, Carpentier, Yves Crouzet and Marcel Hochet were killed when tail flutter developed in a high-speed run. After tests of the SE-117 first pre-production machine, conducted in collaboration with Marcel Dassault, the Voltigeur programme was abandoned along with a projected fast transport, the SE-118 Diplomate.

The Mongols ravaged the Punjab region, advancing as far as Kasur. Alauddin sent an army led by his brother Ulugh Khan (and probably Zafar Khan) to check their advance. This army defeated the invaders on 6 February 1298, killing around 20,000 of them, and forcing the Mongols to retreat.  Mongol raids  The Mongol Chagatai Khanate had invaded the Delhi Sultanate a number of times, including in 1241, 1245, 1257, and 1285. Alauddin's predecessor Jalaluddin also faced a Mongol invasion, and managed to halt it. During Alauddin's reign, the Mongols invaded India again: compared to the previous invasions, these were large-scale invasions. The first of these invasions was ordered by the Mongol ruler Duwa, who sent his noyan Kadar (or Keder) to India with a 100,000-strong force. In the winter of 1297-98, Kadar invaded and ravaged the Punjab region of the Delhi Sultanate, which was ruled by Alauddin Khalji. Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau mentions that the Mongols reached India by crossing the Sulaiman Mountains. They crossed the major rivers of the Punjab, and burnt the Khokhar villages. They advanced up to Kasur, where they destroyed houses: according Khusrau, the light emitted from the burning of the houses could be seen from the suburbs of the city.  Alauddin's retaliation  When Alauddin learned about the havoc caused by the Mongols, he directed his brother and general Ulugh Khan to march against the invaders. According to Ziauddin Barani, Zafar Khan led the Delhi army along with Ulugh Khan, but Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau omits Zafar Khan's name. Barani is probably correct. (Zafar Khan's name was omitted in the dynasty's official chronicles because Alauddin was unhappy with his reckless disobedience during the Battle of Kili). According to Khusrau, Ulugh Khan covered the distance of two marches in a single day to face the Mongols. On 6 February 1298, the Delhi army reached Jaran-Manjur, a place located on the banks of the Sutlej River. According to the contemporary chronicler Amir Khusrau's Dawal Rani, the battle was fought at a place called Jaran Manjur on the banks of the Sutlej River. The name of the place appears as \\"Jadwa o Manjur\\" and \\"Jurat Mahud\\" in the various manuscripts of Tarikh-i- Firuz Shahi,, a work by the near-contemporary chronicler Ziauddin Barani. Henry Miers Elliot, who translated Barani's text into English, identified the site of the battle as modern Jalandhar (which lies to the north-west of the Sutlej river). Firishta (16th century) states that the battle was fought near Lahore, which is located around 130 km from Jalandhar. \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni (16th century) names the site as Jaran Manjur. Nizamuddin Ahmad Harawi (17th century) states that the site was located in Sindh. At the battle site, Ulugh Khan ordered his soldiers to cross the Sutlej River without the boats. According to Khusrau, 20,000 Mongols were killed in the ensuing battle. He boasts that the Mongols \\"fled like ants and locusts, and were trampled like ants\\". The wounded among the Mongols were beheaded, and the other survivors were put into chains. The prisoners were brought to Delhi, where they were trampled to death by elephants. The victory increased Alauddin's prestige, and stabilized his position on the throne of Delhi, which he had ascended recently in 1296.

She was a former dancing girl who exercised supreme influence over the Emperor, encouraged frivolity and pleasure which eventually led to his ignominious downfall. She was the favorite concubine of Jahandar Shah and is more often referred to in histories by her given name Lal Kunwar.  Origins and family  She is alternately referred to as a singing girl, a dancing girl, a Nautch girl, or Kanchani. She had no prior ties to the court or claims to nobility, but rose to become the favorite companion of Jahandar Shah. Her father, Khasusiyat Khan, supposedly descended from Mian Tansen, a musician of some renown during the reign of Akbar.  Political influence  She is credited with elevating the status of her relatives, as was the custom of the time for the position of the queen. Members of her family were given titles and lands under the mansabdari system, along with valuable gifts. Three of her brothers were ennobled with the titles Niamat Khan, Namdar Khan, and Khanzad Khan. Other members of the Kalavant class were elevated as well. These actions invited the ire of established courtiers, for they felt their own positions had been sullied by the inclusion of lower class persons. One such courtier, Wazir Zulfiqar Khan, went as far as arresting her brother, Khushal Khan, on the charge of assaulting a girl, to keep him from being appointed Subedar of Multan. Comparisons have been made to Nur Jahan, who also exercised considerable influence over the placement of her own relatives. Like Nur Jahan, Lal Kunwar received a massive allowance, as well as fortunes in jewels and goods. She was permitted to use the emperor's standard and drums, and was attended by a procession of five hundred men. Unlike Nur Jahan, she did not influence the policy of the state and her interests seem confined to devotion to her family and emperor.  Controversial behavior  This resentment for her lower class origins and influence over the emperor may have fueled poor public opinion of her, and aided in the circulation of anecdotes regarding not only her character, but also that of Jahandar Shah himself. The emperor and his consort were famously fond of drink, and one night they were so inebriated on a ride home that when they arrived, Lal Kunwar simply exited the cart and went to bed. The drunken emperor was nowhere to be found in the morning, and when the staff awoke Lal Kunwar, she fell into hysterics for she had thought he was by her side that night. Eventually, the emperor was found passed out drunk, still in the driver's cart. Another anecdote suggests that at her hinting, Jahandar Shah once ordered the entire crew as well as their passengers to abandon a boat, purely so she could satisfy her curiosity to watch so many people drown. The emperor's aunt, Zinat-un-Nissa (daughter of Aurangzeb), disapproved of her and would not visit or acknowledge her at court. She is said to have hurled insults at the Begum, and at her request the emperor declined to visit his aunt and ignored her invitations. Lal Kunwar was not fond of Jahandar Shah's two young sons, and consequently their father stopped seeing them and had them imprisoned. Under her companionship, Jahandar Shah gave himself over to indecencies such as bathing and frolicking naked in public, and subjecting himself to the physical and verbal abuses of drunken musicians in his own court. Her influence is credited with the loss of respect for the Mughal court system, and the role of the emperor. Despite her almost unanimously poor reputation amongst the Mughal elite, some modern revisionist scholars maintain that she was observed to be sympathetic and charitable toward the lower classes.  Death of Jahandar Shah  Near the end of his reign, when he had lost to Farrukhsiyar at Agra, Lal Kunwar joined the deposed emperor in prison until he was ultimately executed.

The Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji dispatched his general Zafar Khan to evict the Mongols. Zafar Khan recaptured the fort, and imprisoned the Mongol leader Saldi and his companions.  Mongol invasion  The Mongol Chagatai Khanate had invaded the Delhi Sultanate a number of times. In February 1298, a Delhi army led by Alauddin Khalji's general Ulugh Khan inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mongols. Sometime later, a Mongol force invaded the Sindh region on located on the western frontier of the Delhi Sultanate. The invaders occupied the fort of Sivistan (also called Siwistan or Sibi). This place can be identified with the north-western part of Sindh (around modern Sehwan). The invasion seems to have happened in 1298-99. According to the 17th century chronicle Zafar-al-Walih, the Mongols occupied the Sivistan fort in 697 AH, and the Delhi forces recaptured it in 698 AH. The 14th century chronicler Ziauddin Barani states that the invasion was led by Saldi (or Soldi) and his brother. Historian Peter Jackson believes that \\"Saldi\\" is the Indian transcription of the Mongol name \\"Sogedei\\" (or \\"Sogetei\\"). The 14th century chronicler Isami describes Saldi as a Turk and his associate as a \\"Baluch\\". Based on this, Jackson theorizes that Sogedei's forces were fugitives from the Neguderi territory in present-day Afghanistan. The 16th century historian Firishta claims that the invasion was led by Duwa (the ruler of the Chagatai Khanate) and his brother Chaldi (Saldi). However, this is obviously incorrect: Firishta states that after their defeat, Saldi and his brother were imprisoned and brought to Delhi. On the other hand, Duwa was a powerful ruler who remained in power until 1306-07.  Alauddin's response  In 1298-99, a large part of Alauddin's army had marched to Gujarat, led by Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan. In absence of these reputed generals, Alauddin dispatched Zafar Khan, the governor of Samana, to evict the Mongols from Sivistan. Despite a barrage of arrows from the Mongols and despite not making use of any siege engines, Zafar Khan's army entered the fort. According to the Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau, Zafar Khan reclaimed the fort in heavy battles involving melee combats using short ranged weapons like axes, swords, javelins, and spears. Khan carried out this siege without using standard military equipments of siege warfare such as manjaniq or ballistas (aradah or irada). He did not even resort to mines, wooden siege towers (gargaj) or earthwork battlement mounds (pashib).  Aftermath  Saldi, his brother and other Mongols (both male and female) were arrested and brought to Delhi in chains. No chroniclers state what happened to them, but it is likely that Alauddin ordered them to be killed. The victory established Zafar Khan's reputation as a brilliant general. According to the chronicler Ziauddin Barani, Zafar Khan's success made both Alauddin and his brother Ulugh Khan jealous. Barani further states that they made plans to blind or poison Zafar Khan. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena doubts the truthfulness of Barani's allegations. Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau does not mention this conflict in his writings. Alauddin perceived Zafar Khan's actions in the subsequent Battle of Kili (1299) as reckless and a sign of disobedience: therefore, Zafar Khan's name was omitted in the royal chronicles. However, later chroniclers such as Ziauddin Barani, Isami and Firishta have described it.

For past and current Ebola epidemics, treatment has been primarily supportive in nature. , two experimental treatments known as REGN-EB3 and mAb-114 were found to be 90% effective. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb, formerly REGN-EB3) with an indication for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus. Overview In March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a major Ebola outbreak in Guinea, a western African nation. The disease then rapidly spread to the neighboring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. The 2014 West African Ebola outbreak is the largest Ebola outbreak ever documented, and the first recorded in the region. The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has stated that the scientific community is still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented. The unavailability of treatments in the most-affected regions has spurred controversy, with some calling for experimental drugs to be made more widely available in Africa on a humanitarian basis, and others warning that making unproven drugs widely available would be unethical, especially in light of past experimentation conducted in developing countries by Western drug companies. As a result of the controversy, on 12 August an expert panel of the WHO endorsed the use of interventions with as-yet-unknown effects for both treatment and prevention of Ebola, and also said that deciding which treatments should be used and how to distribute them equitably were matters that needed further discussion. Conventional trials to study efficacy by exposure of humans to the pathogen are obviously not feasible in this case. For such situations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established the \\"animal efficacy rule\\" allowing limited licensure to be approved on the basis of animal model studies that replicate human disease, combined with evidence of safety. A number of experimental treatments are being considered for use in the context of this outbreak, and are currently or will soon undergo clinical trials. A distributed computing project, Outsmart Ebola Together, has been launched by World Community Grid in collaboration with the Scripps Research Institute to help find chemical compounds to fight the disease. It uses the idle processing capacity of volunteers' computers and tablets. The Centre for epidemic and microbiological research and treatment was constructed in the Guinean Kindia province. The Centre was designed and created by RUSAL specialists with the assistance of Rospotrebnadzor scientists (RUSAL has invested $10m). Experimental treatments being researched Antibodies * ZMapp is a combination of three chimeric monoclonal antibodies effective in Ebola-infected monkeys. Due to a limited supply of the antibody preparation, it was used to treat a small number of individuals infected with the Ebola virus early in the 2014-5 West Africa outbreak; although some individuals recovered, the outcome is not considered statistically significant. The National Institutes of Health announced on 27 February 2015, the commencement of a randomized controlled trial of ZMapp to be conducted in Liberia and the United States. From March 2015, through November 2015, 72 individuals infected with the Ebola virus were enrolled in the trial; investigators stopped enrolling new subjects in January 2016, having failed to reach its enrollment goal of 200 due to the waning of the Ebola outbreak. As a result, although a 40% lower risk of death was calculated for those who received ZMapp, the difference was not statistically significant and ultimately it could not be determined whether the use of ZMapp was superior to the optimized standard of care alone. However, ZMapp was found to be safe and well tolerated. ZMapp was discontinued in the 2018-19 Kivu Ebola epidemic. * The mAb114 monoclonal antibody was derived from an EVD survivor of the 1995 DRC outbreak in Kikwit. It binds to the glycoprotein cap of the virus. , it had not been tested in humans, but been tested in three non-human primates; it worked less well at preventing disease when given alone than in combination with another mAb. , it was found to be safe and effective for humans. Antivirals and other drugs * Favipiravir (Avigan) is a broad- spectrum antiviral drug, used to treat influenza, which in a mouse model appears to be useful in treating Ebola disease. A phase two clinical trial started in Guinea during December 2014, with early reports indicating that it has some benefit. * Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, delayed death and increased survival rate in both mouse and monkey models; adverse effects, such as birth defects and red blood cell breakdown, limit its use. * BCX4430 is a broad- spectrum nucleoside analog antiviral drug developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. A phase one trial started in December 2014. The drug was effective in Ebola-infected monkeys. * Brincidofovir, an antiviral drug, has been granted an emergency FDA approval as an investigational new drug for the treatment of Ebola after it was found to be effective against Ebola virus in in vitro tests. A phase two trial started during January 2015 in Liberia, but was subsequently discontinued due to a lack of suitable subjects. * TKM-Ebola is an RNA interference drug candidate; a Phase II trial started on 11 March 2015, and stopped enrolling new subjects on 19 June 2015, after it appeared not to work; statistical analysis was ongoing at the time. * AVI-7537 is an antiviral drug developed by Sarepta Therapeutics, which was effective in Ebola-infected monkeys. A phase one trial May 2010, to November 2011, showed that the drug was safe in healthy adults; however, a later phase one trial was withdrawn due to funding constraints. * JK-05 is an antiviral drug developed by Sihuan Pharmaceutical along with Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In tests on mice, JK-05 shows efficacy against a range of viruses, including Ebola. It is claimed to have a simple molecular structure, which should be readily amenable to synthesis scale-up for mass production. The drug has been given preliminary approval by the Chinese authorities to be available for Chinese health workers involved in combating the outbreak, and Sihuan are preparing to conduct clinical trials in West Africa. Blood products The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that transfusion of whole blood or purified serum from Ebola survivors has the greatest potential to be implemented immediately, and has issued an interim guideline for this therapy. A study in Sierra Leone started in November 2014, and preliminary results show an 80 percent survival rate. Trials in Liberia and Guinea started in January 2015, with funding from the Gates Foundation. Blood transfusions were also used in a 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 7 out of 8 patients survived. Existing drugs without anti-Ebola activity Ribavirin is also known to be ineffective against ebolaviruses despite its effectiveness against other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Lassa fever. Interferon therapies have been tried as a form of treatment for EVD, but were found to be ineffective. Potential diagnostic tests One issue which hinders control of Ebola is that diagnostic tests that are currently available require specialised equipment and highly trained personnel. Since there are few suitable testing centres in West Africa, this leads to delay in diagnosis. In December, a conference in Geneva will aim to work out which diagnostic tools could identify Ebola reliably and more quickly. The meeting, convened by the WHO and the non-profit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, seeks to identify tests that can be used by untrained staff, do not require electricity or can run on batteries or solar power and use reagents that can withstand temperatures of 40 ¬∞C. , a number of diagnostic tests are under trial: * Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase, based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). The new equipment, about the size of a laptop and solar-powered, allows testing to be done in remote areas; testing commenced in Guinea during January 2015. * In December 2014, the FDA approved LightMix Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR Test for emergency use on patients with symptoms of Ebola. * Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a 10-minute Ebola test using Matrix Multiplexed Diagnostic (MMDx) technology. It still has to complete testing to gain FDA approval. * Corgenix Medical Corp announced on 26 February 2015, that health regulators had approved its rapid Ebola test for emergency use. The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test involves putting a drop of blood on a paper strip and waiting for at least 15 minutes for a reaction. * On 29 March 2015, a new rapid Ebola virus diagnostic kit/test was developed by British military scientists and NHS in Sierra Leone. Hemopurifier The Hemopurifier is a single-use disposable biological cartridge designed for use with dialysis machines and other blood circulatory pumps. It is a method for removal of viruses from blood by lectin affinity hemodialysis which embodies reducing viral loads in the blood of individuals infected with a virus. During October 2014, the Hemopurifier was used as an adjunct in the treatment of a patient who was suffering from Ebola, who then recovered. The FDA subsequently approved the device for testing in up to 20 infected Ebola cases in the United States.

The school served as a specialized facility for educating the state's blind children. Consisting of eight buildings constructed between 1899 and 1925, it is now home to the Buffalo Ridge Resort. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  History  The citizens of Gary, South Dakota were invested in bringing a facility for blind people into the town, and initially proposed that their old Deuel county courthouse be used for the building, as they had lost their county seat and no longer had need for the courthouse. However, after inspection by the Board of Charities and Corrections, the town built a new building instead, to better accommodate the future students. The South Dakota School for the Blind was opened on March 1, 1900, and was the United States' 42nd school for the blind. In 1945, the school came under the control of the South Dakota Board of Regents. Beginning in 1957, plans for moving the school began, as the facilities were subpar and the students did not have access to a city. The school was moved to a new campus in Aberdeen in 1961, and after this the campus served for a few years as an elderly home.  Education  The students who studied at South Dakota's School for the Blind followed a curriculum similar to that of their non-visually impaired peers. The school taught braille in addition to their general coursework, and various other courses on things like piano tuning, upholstery, and family and consumer sciences. Additionally, the school kept its own animals and gardens for dairy, meat products, fruits, and vegetables, which were maintained by and served to the students and faculty who ate at the school. One feature of the school was that it contained tunnels between the separate buildings, which allowed students to travel between buildings without having to go outside into the harsh South Dakota winters.  Current use  In the 1980s the building which formerly housed South Dakota's original school for the blind fell out of use. In 2008, Joe Kolbach bought the campus and turned it into the Buffalo Ridge Resort. Kolbach has also used the resort to house young adults who were formerly in the foster care system, in an effort to help them transition into adult life. Some visitors at the resort have claimed to see ghosts of former students during their visits.

Early career Arthur Edmund Sandbach was born on 30 July 1859, the third son of Henry Robertson Sandbach of Hafodunos Hall in Denbighshire, a wealthy Anglo-Welsh landowner. Sandbach was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, following which he was commissioned in the Royal Engineers as a Lieutenant on 6 April 1879. He served in the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882, seeing action at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the 1885 Sudan Campaign, the 1886‚Äì87 Burmese Expedition, and the Sikkim Expedition of 1888. He was promoted to Captain on 1 April 1889, and in 1891 served as the aide-de-camp to Major- General Elles, commanding the Hazara Expedition of 1891. He was promoted to Major in November 1897, and during the Nile Expedition of 1898 he held the post of assistant adjutant-general in the Egyptian army, where he was mentioned in despatches and appointed a brevet Lieutenant-Colonel. On returning from Egypt at the start of 1899, Sandbach was appointed as the Military Secretary to the Viceroy of India, a post he held until November, when the outbreak of the Second Boer War meant that he was sent to South Africa. He worked on the staff in South Africa as an assistant adjutant- general, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order as well as a second mention in despatches. Returning from South Africa in 1902, he married the Hon. Ida Douglas-Pennant, a daughter of George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn, with whom he would have one daughter. In 1904, he returned again to India where he was appointed to command the 1st Sappers and Miners, the senior Indian engineer regiment. Accordingly, he was promoted to the brevet rank of Colonel in February 1904, and the substantive rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in April 1905. In 1907 he relinquished command of the 1st Sappers, and returned to England, where he was appointed Officer Commanding Royal Engineers at Aldershot and took the (partly honorary) position as chair of a Territorial Force county association. In 1910, he transferred to Irish Command as the Chief Engineer. In this post, he was given a substantive promotion to Colonel and a temporary rank of Brigadier-General. First World War Sandbach was still holding his post at Irish Command on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. While he officially remained Chief Engineer in Ireland until 5 October, he was in fact appointed to accompany the British Expeditionary Force to France, as the Commander Royal Engineers in II Corps.Appendix 1: Order of battle of the British Expeditionary Force, August 1914. In: He was promoted to Major-General in October 1914, and with the expansion of the Expeditionary Force in early 1915, he was appointed as Chief Engineer of Second Army, but was recalled in April 1915 to act as the temporary Inspector of Royal Engineers. In November 1915, Sandbach was appointed to command the 68th (2nd Welsh) Division, a second-line Territorial unit on home defence duties in England. He handed over command in February 1916 on his transfer to the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, another reserve unit. The 59th was the \\"mobile division\\" in the Home Army, held in readiness to combat a landing along the East Coast; when the Easter Rising broke out in Dublin on 24 April 1916, it was ordered into immediate readiness and despatched to Ireland. Here, units of the division ‚Äì many with only a few weeks' training ‚Äì were hastily thrown into combat, some taking heavy casualties; the 2/7th and 2/8th Sherwood Foresters lost over two hundred men killed or wounded at Mount Street on 26 April and at the South Dublin Union on 27 April. After the end of fighting in Dublin, the 59th moved to the Curragh for further training, and was returned to England at the end of the year. In February 1917, the 59th Division was ordered to the Western Front, despite concerns that its training schedule had been disrupted by service in Ireland. It was deployed during the Advance to the Hindenburg Line in March‚ÄìApril 1917, where it took unexpectedly high losses. Sandbach was relieved of command on 10 April, felt by his superiors to be too old for command of a front-line division.Robbins, Simon (2005).

Seven species of lorikeets now recognised were once lumped together under Trichoglossus haematodus. Taxonomy In 1758, English naturalist George Edwards described this species as the red-breasted parrakeet in his work Gleanings of Natural History. He had obtained a stuffed specimen from a China warehouse in London, that had come from the East Indies. \\"It is a parrakeet, equal to any I have seen for beauty; and I believe hath never been described or figured until now.\\" In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the coconut lorikeet in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Ambon in Indonesia. He used the French name La perruche vari√©e d'Amboine and the Latin name Psittaca amboinensis varia. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Acknowledging both previous authors as having written about the same species, Carl Linnaeus formally described the coconut lorikeet in 1771 as Psittacus haematod.(us). He had abbreviated the name to avoid it spilling over onto the next line. The shortened form was followed for many years. The specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek haimat≈çdƒìs for \\"blood-red\\". Hence the translation of its binomial name is \\"bloody hair-tongue\\". For many years, the species was broadly defined with 20 or 22 subspecies recognised, and was known as the rainbow lorikeet. This name has been reapplied to eastern Australian populations, now classified as a distinct species Trichoglossus moluccanus. Also recognised as distinct species are the sunset lorikeet (T. forsteni), leaf lorikeet (T. weberi), marigold lorikeet (T. capistratus), red-collared lorikeet (T. rubritorquis), and Biak lorikeet (T. rosenbergii). Five subspecies are recognised: *T. h. haematodus ‚Äì the nominate subspecies, is found in the southern Moluccas, west Papuan islands, and in the west and north coast of New Guinea. *T. h. massena ‚Äì found in eastern New Guinea, Karkar Island, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu *T. h. nesophilus ‚Äì found on Ninigo and Hermit Islands (Admiralty Islands) *T. h. flavicans ‚Äì New Hanover and the Admiralty Islands *T. h. deplanchii, also known as Deplanche's lorikeet, is found on New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands *T. h. nigrogularis ‚Äì Kai and Aru Islands, and southern New Guinea. This includes the former subspecies caeruliceps and resembles the rainbow lorikeet (T. moluccanus). Molecular analysis using mitochondrial cytochrome b confirms this subspecies as more closely related to the latter taxon. \\"Coconut lorikeet\\" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). Description The coconut lorikeet measures in length and weighs around . The bill is orange-red, and the head dark blue fading to brown at the neck. It has a yellow collar and green upperparts. The breast is red with blue-black barring, and the belly is green with yellow barring. The tail is green above and barred in green and yellow below. The male's iris is bright red, while in the female it is orange-red. Distribution and habitat Trichoglossus haematodus is found in eastern Indonesia, on Buru, Seram, Misool, Waigeo, Numfoor, Yapen and the Aru Islands, in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea on New Guinea, in the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. The species occupies a wide range of lowland and wooded hill habitats, including mangroves, rainforest, nypa forest, swamps, savanna and woodland. It also occupies human-modified areas including coconut plantations, gardens, agricultural land and disturbed forest. It is found from sea level up to as high as ; this upper altitude level varies by location. Biology These lorikeets have on the tip of their specialized tongue a small brush, which is actually the tongue's extended papillae. With the help of the tongue, they are able to feed on nectar and pollen from flowers.Ananda Porto, Terra da Gente Periquito-arco-√≠ris tem l√≠ngua adaptada para se alimentar de nectar They mainly feed on nectar and pollen, but they also eat other parts of the flowers, as well as seeds, fruits, berries, insects, and larvae. They usually make a huge noise during flight, emitting screeching calls (e.g. ‚Äúpeaow-peaow- peaow‚Äù), at regular intervals. Coconut lorikeets are monogamous birds, choosing only one partner for their whole life. They are diurnal birds living in very large bands. In the evening, they join their fellows in a dormitory tree. These birds may breed throughout most of year, depending on the region. Usually they breed in the spring, from July to December. They usually raise one brood a year, sometimes two. Nests are usually located in holes in decaying wood, such as hollows of eucalyptus trees, at a height of above the ground. Females lay two matte white, round eggs and incubate them for 23‚Äì25 days. Parents feed the chicks for 7‚Äì8 weeks, after which they leave the nest and after another 2‚Äì3 weeks they become completely independent.Gordon Beruldsen, Australian Birds, their Nests and Eggs, Kenmore Hills, G.

In a virtual memory compression system, pages to be paged out of virtual memory are compressed and stored in physical memory, which is usually random-access memory (RAM), or sent as compressed to auxiliary storage such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD). In both cases the virtual memory range, whose contents has been compressed, is marked inaccessible so that attempts to access compressed pages can trigger page faults and reversal of the process (retrieval from auxiliary storage and decompression). The footprint of the data being paged is reduced by the compression process; in the first instance, the freed RAM is returned to the available physical memory pool, while the compressed portion is kept in RAM. In the second instance, the compressed data is sent to auxiliary storage but the resulting I/O operation is smaller and therefore takes less time. In some implementations, including zswap, zram and Helix Software Company‚Äôs Hurricane, the entire process is implemented in software. In other systems, such as IBM's MXT, the compression process occurs in a dedicated processor that handles transfers between a local cache and RAM. Virtual memory compression is distinct from garbage collection (GC) systems, which remove unused memory blocks and in some cases consolidate used memory regions, reducing fragmentation and improving efficiency. Virtual memory compression is also distinct from context switching systems, such as Connectix's RAM Doubler (though it also did online compression) and Apple OS 7.1, in which inactive processes are suspended and then compressed as a whole. Benefits By reducing the I/O activity caused by paging requests, virtual memory compression can produce overall performance improvements. The degree of performance improvement depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of any compression co-processors, spare bandwidth on the CPU, speed of the I/O channel, speed of the physical memory, and the compressibility of the physical memory contents. On multi-core, multithreaded CPUs, some benchmarks show performance improvements of over 50%. In some situations, such as in embedded devices, auxiliary storage is limited or non- existent. In these cases, virtual memory compression can allow a virtual memory system to operate, where otherwise virtual memory would have to be disabled. This allows the system to run certain software which would otherwise be unable to operate in an environment with no virtual memory. Flash memory has certain endurance limitations on the maximum number of erase cycles it can undergo, which can be as low as 100 erase cycles. In systems where Flash Memory is used as the only auxiliary storage system, implementing virtual memory compression can reduce the total quantity of data being written to auxiliary storage, improving system reliability. Shortcomings Low compression ratios One of the primary issues is the degree to which the contents of physical memory can be compressed under real-world loads. Program code and much of the data held in physical memory is often not highly compressible, since efficient programming techniques and data architectures are designed to automatically eliminate redundancy in data sets. Various studies show typical data compression ratios ranging from 2:1 to 2.5:1 for program data, similar to typically achievable compression ratios with disk compression. Background I/O In order for virtual memory compression to provide measurable performance improvements, the throughput of the virtual memory system must be improved when compared to the uncompressed equivalent. Thus, the additional amount of processing introduced by the compression must not increase the overall latency. However, in I/O-bound systems or applications with highly compressible data sets, the gains can be substantial. Increased thrashing The physical memory used by a compression system reduces the amount of physical memory available to processes that a system runs, which may result in increased paging activity and reduced overall effectiveness of virtual memory compression. This relationship between the paging activity and available physical memory is roughly exponential, meaning that reducing the amount of physical memory available to system processes results in an exponential increase of paging activity. In circumstances where the amount of free physical memory is low and paging is fairly prevalent, any performance gains provided by the compression system (compared to paging directly to and from auxiliary storage) may be offset by an increased page fault rate that leads to thrashing and degraded system performance. In an opposite state, where enough physical memory is available and paging activity is low, compression may not impact performance enough to be noticeable. The middle ground between these two circumstanceslow RAM with high paging activity, and plenty of RAM with low paging activityis where virtual memory compression may be most useful. However, the more compressible the program data is, the more pronounced are the performance improvements as less physical memory is needed to hold the compressed data. For example, in order to maximize the use of a compressed pages cache, Helix Software Company's Hurricane 2.0 provides a user-configurable compression rejection threshold. By compressing the first 256 to 512 bytes of a 4 KiB page, this virtual memory compression system determines whether the configured compression level threshold can be achieved for a particular page; if achievable, the rest of the page would be compressed and retained in a compressed cache, and otherwise the page would be sent to auxiliary storage through the normal paging system. The default setting for this threshold is an 8:1 compression ratio. Price/performance issues In hardware implementations the technology also relies on price differentials between the various components of the system, for example, the difference between the cost of RAM and the cost of a processor dedicated to compression. The relative price/performance differences of the various components tend to vary over time. For example, the addition of a compression co-processor may have minimal impact on the cost of a CPU. Prioritization In a typical virtual memory implementation, paging happens on a least recently used basis, potentially causing the compression algorithm to use up CPU cycles dealing with the lowest priority data. Furthermore, program code is usually read-only, and is therefore never paged- out. Instead code is simply discarded, and re-loaded from the program‚Äôs auxiliary storage file if needed. In this case the bar for compression is higher, since the I/O cycle it is attempting to eliminate is much shorter, particularly on flash memory devices. Compression using quantization Accelerator designers exploit quantization to reduce the bitwidth of values and reduce the cost of data movement. However, any value that does not fit in the reduced bitwidth results in an overflow (we refer to these values as outliers). Therefore accelerators use quantization for applications that are tolerant to overflows. In most applications the rate of outliers is low and values are often within a narrow range providing the opportunity to exploit quantization in generalpurpose processors. However, a software implementation of quantization in general-purpose processors has three problems. First, the programmer has to manually implement conversions and the additional instructions that quantize and dequantize values, imposing a programmer‚Äôs effort and performance overhead. Second, to cover outliers, the bitwidth of the quantized values often become greater than or equal to the original values. Third, the programmer has to use standard bitwidth; otherwise, extracting non-standard bitwidth (i.e., 1-7, 9-15, and 17-31) for representing narrow integers exacerbates the overhead of software-based quantization. A hardware support in the memory hierarchy of general-purpose processors for quantization can solve these problems. Tha hardware support allows representing values by few and flexible numbers of bits and storing outliers in their original format in a separate space, preventing any overflow. It minimizes metadata and the overhead of locating quantized values using a software-hardware interaction that transfers quantization parameters and data layout to hardware. As a result, transparent hardware-based quantization has three advantages over cache compression techniques: (i) less metadata, (ii) higher compression ratio for floating-point values and cache blocks with multiple data types, and (iii) lower overhead for locating the compressed blocks. History Virtual memory compression has gone in and out of favor as a technology. The price and speed of RAM and external storage have plummeted due to Moore's Law and improved RAM interfaces such as DDR3, thus reducing the need for virtual memory compression, while multi-core processors, server farms, and mobile technology together with the advent of flash based systems make virtual memory compression more attractive. Origins Paul R. Wilson proposed compressed caching of virtual memory pages in 1990, in a paper circulated at the ACM OOPSLA/ECOOP '90 Workshop on Garbage Collection (\\"Some Issues and Strategies in Heap Management and Memory Hierarchies\\"), and appearing in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in January 1991. Helix Software Company pioneered virtual memory compression in 1992, filing a patent application for the process in October of that year. In 1994 and 1995, Helix refined the process using test-compression and secondary memory caches on video cards and other devices. However, Helix did not release a product incorporating virtual memory compression until July 1996 and the release of Hurricane 2.0, which used the Stac Electronics Lempel‚ÄìZiv‚ÄìStac compression algorithm and also used off-screen video RAM as a compression buffer to gain performance benefits. In 1995, RAM cost nearly $50 per megabyte, and Microsoft's Windows 95 listed a minimum requirement of 4 MB of RAM. Due to the high RAM requirement, several programs were released which claimed to use compression technology to gain ‚Äúmemory‚Äù. Most notorious was the SoftRAM program from Syncronys Softcorp. SoftRAM was revealed to be ‚Äúplacebo software‚Äù which did not include any compression technology at all. Other products, including Hurricane and MagnaRAM, included virtual memory compression, but implemented only run-length encoding, with poor results, giving the technology a negative reputation. In its 8 April 1997 issue, PC Magazine published a comprehensive test of the performance enhancement claims of several software virtual memory compression tools. In its testing PC Magazine found a minimal (5% overall) performance improvement from the use of Hurricane, and none at all from any of the other packages. However the tests were run on Intel Pentium systems which had a single core and were single threaded, and thus compression directly impacted all system activity. In 1996, IBM began experimenting with compression, and in 2000 IBM announced its Memory eXpansion Technology (MXT). MXT was a stand- alone chip which acted as a CPU cache between the CPU and memory controller. MXT had an integrated compression engine which compressed all data heading to/from physical memory. Subsequent testing of the technology by Intel showed 5-20% overall system performance improvement, similar to the results obtained by PC Magazine with Hurricane. Recent developments * In early 2008, a Linux project named zram (originally called compcache) was released; in a 2013 update, it was incorporated into Chrome OS and Android 4.4 * In 2010, IBM released Active Memory Expansion (AME) for AIX 6.1 which implements virtual memory compression. * In 2012, some versions of the POWER7+ chip included the AME hardware accelerator for data compression support, used on AIX, for virtual memory compression. * In December 2012, the zswap project was announced; it was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in September 2013. * In June 2013, Apple announced that it would include virtual memory compression in OS X Mavericks, using the Wilson-Kaplan WKdm algorithm. * A 10 August 2015 \\"Windows Insider Preview\\" update for Windows 10 (build 10525) added support for RAM compression.

It is not known whether the film currently survives,Progressive Silent Film List: The Call of the East at silentera.com which suggests that it is a lost film. Plot As described in a film magazine, Sheila Hepburn (Loomis), the half-sister of Alan Hepburn (Holt), is the daughter of a Japanese mother. While visiting Alan, who works in Tokyo, she attends a festival with her Japanese maid while wearing a Japanese kimono. There she meets the wealthy Arai Takada (Hayakawa), who is taken by the mysterious woman. Alan has dishonored and betrayed O'Mitsu (Aoki), and her brother Arai plans a terrible revenge. Alan loses heavily at cards to Arai and, to forget his losses, accompanies Arai to his country home. There Alan is about to be thrust into a pool of quicksand to die when Sheila appears, having been warned of Arai's plans. Dismayed that the woman he met at the festival is Alan's sister, Arai sees that she and Alan do not meet, but later agrees to release her brother as Sheila wins Arai's love and respect. At that moment Alan appears, having escaped from his prison, and strikes Arai down.

Bassett *Guy Oliver as Cadger *Jane Wolfe as Yuri Reception Like many American films of the time, The Call of the East was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required that these six intertitles be cut: \\"My sister is an outcast, but the man who shamed her shall pay\\", \\"You are my beloved - isn't that enough?\\", \\"At Haksima, Hepburn shall pay for O'Mitsu\\", \\"Tonight your sister she shall pay the price\\", \\"I am ready to marry O'Mitsu\\", and \\"I decline the honor\\". Criticism The film allowed Americans to view the film without concerns about the taboo of miscegenation involving Arai Takada and Sheila Hepburn as an intertitle early in the film stated \\"In reality her mother was Japanese,\\" and the plot indicates that, when Arai met Sheila at the festival, he believed she was Japanese because of the way she was dressed. In contrast, Alan Hepburn treats O'Mitsu simply as his mistress, and the plot requires Arai to ultimately accept the victimization of his sister.

The species is found on or near the sandy seabed in relatively shallow waters in the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Description The eyed flounder is a flattened, disc-shaped fish which grows to a maximum length of but a more typical size is . As with other members of its family, it lies on its right side, and during its development, its right eye migrates to the left side of its head. The protractile mouth is large and the male fish has a spine on the snout and a bony lump in front of the lower eye. The eyes are large and prominent, the lower one being slightly nearer the snout than the upper one. Both eyes have a fleshy ridge above and behind them. The dorsal fin has 76 to 91 soft rays and has its origin close to the upper eye. It is long and ribbon-like and there is a gap between it and the caudal fin. The anal fin has 58 to 69 soft rays and is also long and distinct from the caudal fin. The color of this fish is pale tan, grey or brown, with patches, mottling and ring-shaped markings, the fish being able to modify its color to match its background. It can change its color in between two and eight seconds. Three larger dark spots lie on the straight portion of the lateral line and there are two fainter ones on the tail. It differs from the slightly darker twospot flounder (Bothus robinsi) because its tail spots are one above the other in this species but one behind the other in the twospot flounder. The underside of this species is pale. Distribution and habitat Eyed flounder The eyed flounder is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, its range extending from Canada to southern Brazil. Its typical habitat is sandy flats in the vicinity of patch reefs, often near areas of coral rubble and seagrass meadows. It commonly occurs at depths down to about but is sometimes found at greater depths, down to . It spends most of the time lying on the seabed, sometimes semi-immersed in the sediment. Biology The eyed flounder feeds on fish, which makes up about a third of its diet, and on crustaceans such as crabs, mantis shrimps, shrimps and amphipods. Near the island of Bonaire, reproduction takes place during the winter. A male eyed flounder defends a territory in which are up to six females, each with its own individual area. Courtship starts about an hour before sunset, and around the time the sun sets culminates in the female swimming a short way off the bottom with the male immediately below her. Both release their spawn simultaneously into the water. The male tries to mate with each of the females on a daily basis. When the larvae hatch from the fertilised eggs, they are pelagic and form part of the plankton in the open water, and their eyes are at first orientated in a normal, symmetrical manner. During their growth and development the eyes migrate to their adult position on the left side of the head. The larvae and juvenile fish form part of the diet of many fish and invertebrates, and the adults are preyed on by predatory fishes, gulls, egrets, herons, seals and sea lions.

Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. The Apparition (French: L'Apparition) is a painting by French artist Gustave Moreau, painted between 1874 and 1876. It shows the biblical character of Salome dancing in front of Herod Antipas with a vision of John the Baptist's head. The 106 cm high and 72,2 cm wide watercolor held by the Paris Mus√©e d'Orsay elaborates an episode told in the Gospel of Matthew 14:6‚Äì11 and Mark 6:21‚Äì29. On a feast on the occasion of Herod Antipas' birthday, the princess Salome dances in front of the king and his guest, pleasing him so much he promises her anything she wished for. Incited by her mother Herodias, who was reproved by the imprisoned John the Baptist for her illegitimate marriage to Herod, Salome demands John's head in a charger. Regretful but compelled to keep his word in front of his peers, Herod fulfills Salome's demand. John the Baptist is beheaded, the head brought in a charger and given to Salome, who gives it to her mother. Moreau approached the biblical theme in 19 paintings, 6 watercolors and more than 150 drawings. Part of a series of at least 8 closely resembling paintings and more than 40 sketch drawings, it is regarded a key work of Moreau's opus, symbolism and fin de si√®cle art in general. Upon its first presentation 1876 in Salon (French: Salon de Paris), the painting caused a sensation. It has since made a lasting impression on various artists, notably from the Decadent movement.  Description  Against the backdrop of a lavishly decorated palace inspired by the Alhambra Salome stands out in an array of bejeweled veils, her body facing the viewer, her left arm pointing up in the air to John the Baptist's hovering head, enclosed by a halo. At the back in the half-light stands the executioner with his sword, at his feet the silver charger. Seated in ascending position on Salome's side are a lutanist, Herodias and Herod Antipas. They face the foreground events seemingly lit by John's halo and its reflections on Salome's costume. The severed head recalls a Japanese print copied by Moreau at the Palais de l'Industrie in 1869 as well as the severed head of Medusa as held by Benvenuto Cellini's bronze Perseus with the head of Medusa in Florence (Loggia dei Lanzi). Since no one, including Salome, reacts directly to the vision central to the composition, it is unclear if it is real, imagined by the princess or a collective hallucination. This deliberately confusing technique has been attributed to an alleged consumption of opium and thereby caused hallucinations, though justification of such claims was never established. Its surreal setting and mystic air, evoked by obscure architectural and textile opulence, contrast with previous interpretations of the subject, making The Apparition a key work for the emerging symbolist movement. Belgian art dealer L√©on Gauchez bought The Appariton in 1876 upon its first presentation at the Salon where it was exhibited with several other of Moreau's works. The following year Gauchez sent it to be exhibited at London's Grosvenor Gallery where it hung not with the aquarelles in a separate room but in the main East Gallery with the oil paintings. Currently it is located in the Mus√©e d'Orsay.  Style  \\"The dreadful head glows eerily, bleeding all the while, so that clots of dark red form at the ends of hair and beard.\\" (Joris-Karl Huysmans, √Ä Rebours, Chap. VI. 1884) The Apparition stands apart from biblical and historic paintings of the period, incorporating elements of style which would become significant for the aesthetic and symbolist movement, while also anteceding surrealism. Whereas the bible mentions Salome as acting out Herodias' will, Moreau draws her guided by her own lust. Among his series of Salome-paintings, the climactic The Apparition is the most openly erotic with a bare-breasted princess turned towards the viewer, her naked arm directed at the object she will soon receive. By accentuating her stillness, Moreau immobilizes her to be seen alternately as idol or sexual object or both. Some critics also ascribed her statuesque posture to fear, like French writer Joris-Karl Huysmans who muses on the painting in his influential decadent novel √Ä rebours. Moreau himself described Salome as \\"bored and fantastic woman, animal by nature and so disgusted with the complete satisfaction of her desires (that she) gives herself the sad pleasure of seeing her enemy degraded.\\" His sensual presentation of Salome and innovative interpretation of traditional historic and mythological themes caused his art to be regarded as eccentric and provocative. Emphasizing instincts over reason, subjectivity over objectivity and suggestion over definition, the watercolor features essential qualities of symbolism as coined by French poet and critic Jean Mor√©as. Further, the scene's morbidity and underlying themes of necrophilia, incest and sadism associate it with the decadent movement and Fin de siecle art. These disparate elements and the use of complex techniques like highlighting, graftage and incisions, create a sublime ideal of the orient. Excessive detail given to foreign costumes and background elements as strange mural reliefs on the pallast's columns proof characteristic for Moreau who's artistic style tending towards exoticism and orientalism was often referred to as \\"Byzanthine\\". Together with the mysterious titular vision they both evoke fantastic art and indicate his evolution towards fauvism and abstract painting. Rather than being solely a character from academic painting Moreau remained bound to despite his avant-garde-tendencies, his Salome embodies the femme fatale from Victorian imagination who was equally seductive and destructive. Defying conventions of historic and biblic painting, The Apparition became a source for surrealism as did others of Moreau's works.  Motif  The events from which Moreau draws his scene are first described in two parallel passages of the New Testament. \\"...And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.\\" (Mark 6:21‚Äì29, KJV) A shorter version appears in the Gospel of St. Matthew: \\"But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him. But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.\\" (Matt 14:6‚Äì11, D-R) The unnamed dancer identified as Salome by scholars has inspired numerous artist before Moreau, among them Masolino da Panicale, Filippo Lippi, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Titian, Caravaggio, Guido Reni, Fabritius, Henri Regnault and Georges Rochegrosse. Though classic academic subjects from religion and history were superseded by everyday scenes during the 19th century, Salome remained a figure of artistic interest, appearing in Heinrich Heine's 1843 epic poem Atta Troll, The Beheading of John the Baptist by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Jean- Baptiste Regnault's eponymous oil painting and Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1870 poem The Daughter of Herodias. In his 1875 poem Salom√©, Henri Cazaliz's paid homage to Moreau's earlier Salome-paintings, musing on Salome‚Äôs feelings before and after the execution. Still, it were Moreau's The Apparition and its sister piece, an oil version also called The Apparition (1875) which sparked a Salome craze lasting into the 20th century, permeating all forms of art. File:Gustave Moreau Salom√© 1876.jpg Salom√© dansant devant H√©rode (1876) File:Gustave Moreau - l'Apparition.jpgThe Apparition oil on canvas (1876/1877) File:Salome Dancing before Herod by Gustave Moreau.jpg Salome Dancing before Herod, oil on canvas (1876)  Impact  The Apparition quickly became Moreau's best known work, its notoriety growing with the critical and artistic attention it received. Numerous artist drew inspiration from Moreau's Salome, her mimesis infusing their works or insinuating itself in it. French poet Stephane Mallarme's envisions Salome in his Herodiade (1864‚Äì1896) as the virgin-whore seen by many of Moreau's contemporaries \\"The horror of my virginity Delights me, and I would envelope me In the terror of my tresses, that, by night, Inviolate reptile, I might feel the white And glimmering radiance of thy frozen fire, Thou art chaste and diest of desire, White night of ice and of the cruel snow!\\" As Andr√© Fontainas noted 1928 in Mes souvenirs du Symbolisme, many artists since responded to it. Prominent works influenced by the painting include: * Jules Massenet's Herodiade (1877) * Odilon Redon's Salome with the Head of John the Baptist and Apparition * Gustave Flaubert's short story Herodias from his Three Tales * Famously, Oscar Wilde wrote his symbolist play Salome (1893) after being impressed by The Apparition viewing it 1884 at the Louvre * Richard Strauss' opera Salome, based on Wilde's play * Antoine Mariotte's opera Salome, also based on Wilde's Salome * Nick Cave's theatrical dialogue Salome When the renown of its creator faded, The Apparition contained its prominent place in artistic imagination, its lasting impressiveness being crucial to the rediscovery of Moreau's art in the later 20th century.

The name OpenOLAT stands for Open Online Learning And Training, highlighting its open source and online nature. OpenOLAT is open source software and is being developed by frentix GmbH since 2011. OpenOLAT is based on the LMS OLAT developed by the University of Zurich.  History  OpenOLAT originated from the open source project OLAT. In 2011, the University of Zurich initiated a massive refactoring project with the goal of redesigning the complete code base and switching to the Mercurial version control system. With the start of the refactoring, repository access for contributors from the OLAT community was revoked, making further contributions impossible. Since then, the OLAT developers practice open source only in the form of publishing finished source code, but lack any kind of community involvement.Open Letter to the OLAT community. Retrieved August 3, 2016 Because of these changes to OLAT, the OpenOLAT fork was initiated in 2011. OpenOLAT is an alternative to OLAT that follows an open development process and encourages community involvement.frentix startet Open Source Initiative: OpenOLAT Blog entry, December 12, 2012. Retrieved June 4, 2012 The initiator of this new project is frentix GmbH, a spin-off of the University of Zurich, which was founded by one of the founders of OLAT and which provided commercial services for OLAT up to 2011. Since frentix was founded in 2006, the company has contributed major features to the OLAT code base and was responsible for a large part of the bug fixing. For commercial customers, frentix provided OLATpro until the end of 2011, which contained features that were not a part of the public release. With the inception of OpenOLAT, many of the frentix features from the pro OLATpro release were ported to the public OpenOLAT open source release. In release 8.2, the group management system was significantly improved. Release 8.3 added the OpenMeetings integration, and release 8.4 brought major changes to the chat infrastructure while also improving the performance and stability of the whole system. Release 9.0 replaced the JavaScript framework ExtJS with the more light-weight jQuery, for which the whole JavaScript layer was refactored. In addition, the question pool was introduced, which allows collaborative creation and sharing of test questions. The most recent release, version 10.0, includes a complete redesign of all visual aspects of OpenOLAT. The introduction of a responsive design paradigm based on Bootstrap makes OpenOLAT ready for mobile devices and small screen sizes. Also, the learning resources were split up into spearate areas for learners and authors, making them more intuitive and easier to use.  Features  OpenOLAT offers a lot of features for learners and teachers. A set of building blocks allow teachers to create courses using a variety of didactic methods while incorporating communication, collaboration and assessment. More learning resources and tools are available outside of the course system. Learning resources can also be made available to non-registered users, so-called guests. Using different booking methods, courses can also be made available at a cost. OpenOLAT contains many elements typical for learning management systems: * Learning Content Management System: Create and manage learning content using integrated editors for HTML, IMS CP and IMS QTI * Courseware: Course system providing a variety of building blocks and fine- grained rules for visibility and access * Personal Learning Environment: Learning, assessment including evidence of achievement, personal notes * Groupware: Work in learning groups, using collaboration tools like a wiki, a forum, shared folders, and more * Course catalog * Resource folder with document versioning * Coaching feature with logs * Assessments and self-tests with different question types, surveys * Aufgabenbaustein und Themenvergabe * WYSIWYG HTML editor * Internationalization: OpenOLAT is translated to more than 15 languages * User management, with import features * Role and rights management * Supports most browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) * Integrates with existing systems, via REST API, LDAP and Shibboleth  Courses and learning resources  The course system is the central element in OpenOLAT. It is separated into areas for learners and authors. Users with author roles can create and manage courses and learning resources in the authoring environment. Using the various learning resources, many different learning scenarios can be represented in the integrated course editor, including areas for cooperation and collaboration. Learning resources can be created or imported, and can be integrated into one or even multiple courses by creating a reference. Changing a referenced learning resource changes it in all places where is used.  Tests and assessment  Tests in OpenOLAT are used to quiz participants and to prepare them for final exams. Tests can be created and managed in the authoring environment or directly in the course editor. They can either be imported or created using the built-in QTI test editor. OpenOLAT supports the IMS-QTI format, version 1.2. The questionnaire learning resource is useful for surveys. With the assessment tool and the test statistics, tests and questionnaires can be evaluated. The assessment mode for courses allows authors to create exam settings in which tests and assessments are carried out in safe mode during a fixed time span. Adding IP addresses to a configuratioen enhances security. An assessment can be carried out in kiosk by adding the use of the Safe Exam Browser.  Coaching, collaboration and communication  Through the role based authorization system in OpenOLAT, coaches can assigned to courses, groups, or individual users. Social tools like blogs, forums, wikis, podcasts, shared folders, mail, and chat enable communication and collaboration between OpenOLAT users. Groups can be used for projects independently from courses, and can be created by learners themselves, depending on the system configuration.  Personal Learning Environment  OpenOLAT supports different visibility and access rules to courses and other learning resources based on user roles and groups. The OpenOLAT Portal is the personalizable start page for users.  Learning  Visibility and access modifiers can be made dependent on time, groups, or previous achievements. So-called expert rules allow fine-grained control over which users have access to which learning resources. This enables different configurations of a single course for different users. Rules can be applied to whole courses or individually to each learning resource in a course.  Personalization  OpenOLAT Portal OpenOLAT has a customizable portal page, that users can personalize and adjust to their liking. Several portlets can be individually displayed and configured. Further personal tools and settings are found in the extendable personal menu. Instead of the portal, different pages or courses can be set up as start pages. Start pages can be assigned to different users or user groups depending on their roles or attributes, such as field of study or institution. Additionally, each user can choose to override this setting with their own start page.  Authoring ‚Äì course editor, CP editor, test editor  Learning resources OpenOLAT has its own authoring environment, in which courses, learning resources and course elements are combined into elearning courses. This environment allows easy management of all courses and learning resources. Courses have their own course editor for course-specific resource management and configuration. Courses are shared among OpenOLAT instances in a zip file. * Course wizard * Course-specific layout, including preview image * Supports IMS Content Packaging, IMS QTI, and SCORM standards * Metadata and versioning * Glossaries * WYSIWYG editor to easily import images, video, and audio * Each course element can be individually published to make changes visible * Courses can be previewed before publishing using different user settings  Integrated IMS-CP and QTI editors  OpenOLAT contains its own content packaging and test editors, which create IMS content packages and QTI tests. CPs and tests created in OpenOLAT can be easily exported and imported into other LMS, that also support these standardized formats.  System administration  Administration area System administrators manage OpenOLAT in the administration tab. There, the default language can be set, the layout can be changed, quota and versioning settings can be adjusted, and many other settings can be changed to adapt the system to a variety of use cases.  frentix plugins  In addition to the features contained in the public release, frentix offers some custom features to its customers. * Payment options for courses, like PayPal or credit card payment. * Library, offering document management features that is completely separate from the course system. * Members page, which lists all users and has search tools. * Extra settings of courses can be edited and saved via REST API. * Admin consoles simplify the management of admin features and settings. * QTI test statistics allow tests in courses to be evaluated.

Several variants of this lower bound have been proved. This article is based on one of the variants.  Definitions  The bound is based on a perfect BST, P, which contains the keys 1,2,...,n. The structure of P is fixed. For example, for n=7, P can be represented by the following parenthesis structure: ::[([1] 2 [3]) 4 ([5] 6 [7])] For each node y in P, define: * Left(y) = y itself and its left subtree; * Right(y) = the right subtree of y. There is a sequence of accesses to elements of the tree: X = (x1, x2, ..., xm). For each access x and node y, define the label of x for y as: * \\"L\\" - if x is in Left(y); * \\"R\\" - if x is in Right(y); * null - otherwise. The label of y is the concatenation of the labels from all the accesses. For example, if the sequence of accesses is: 7,6,3, then the label of the root (4) is: \\"RRL\\", the label of 6 is: \\"RL\\", and the label of 2 is: \\"L\\". For every node y, the amount of interleaving through y is the number of alternations between L and R in the label of y. In the above example, the interleaving through 4 and 6 is 1 and the interleaving through all other nodes is 0. The interleave bound, \\\\mathit{IB}(X), is the sum of the interleaving through all the nodes of the tree. The interleave bound of the above sequence is 2.  Bound  The interleave bound lemma says that every BST that has to access the elements in the sequence X, must do at least \\\\mathit{IB}(X)/2-n actions.  Proof  Let Ti be the state of an arbitrary BST at time i. For every node y ‚àà {1,...,n}, define the transition point, Trans(y,Ti), as the minimum-depth node z in the BST Ti such that the path from the root of Ti to z includes both a node from Left(y) and a node from Right(y). Intuitively, any BST algorithm on Ti that accesses an element from Right(y) and then an element from Left(y) (or vice versa) must touch Trans(y,Ti) at least once. The following properties of the transition point can be proved: # The transition point is well-defined. I.e., for any node y and time i, there is a unique transition point for y in Ti. # The transition point is 'stable', not changing until it is accessed. I.e., if z=Trans(y,Tj) and the BST access algorithm does not touch z in Ti for all i in the interval [j,k], then z=Trans(y,Tk). # Every node has a different transition point, i.e. the mapping y -> Trans(y,Ti) is one-to-one, i.e. no node in Ti is the transition point for multiple nodes. These properties are used to prove the bound.

History On 19 September 2014, 10 small rebel groups formed the Jaysh al-Ummah. The leader of Jaysh al-Islam, part of the Islamic Front, Zahran Alloush, condemned the formation by saying that \\"there cannot be two heads for the same body\\".

On 3 January 2015, two leaders of Jaysh al-Ummah were assassinated by unknown gunmen. The next day, Jaysh al-Islam declared war on Jaysh al-Ummah and captured its leader and seized its headquarters in Douma within a span of 6 hours. It also issued an arrest warrant against the deputy Nizar Khabbini. During the clashes, the Lions of Ghouta Brigade surrendered to Jaysh al-Islam, while 1,500 members of Jaysh al-Ummah were invited to join the ranks of the Islamic Front.

Kulka was a native Czech speaker. German was his second language. (29 March 1900 ‚Äì 9 May 1971) was a Moravian (Czechoslovak) and New Zealand modern architect who was a key figure in the development of Raumplan architecture in central Europe between 1919 and 1938. Kulka brought this approach to spatial planning and the Loosian traditions of natural material craftsmanship to modern building in New Zealand (1940‚Äì1971) where he was a pioneer of modern architecture.  Life  Henry Kulka was born on 29 March 1900 into a Jewish family in the town of Litovel near Olomouc in the Czech Republic (then Austria-Hungary). His father Moritz owned and ran the village drapery shop. He was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters. Young Henry was sent to Vienna to complete his secondary education after which he studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna. As he found his studies uninspiring he did not complete his degree but preferred to continue his architectural development as a pupil of the pioneer modern architect and ideologue Adolf Loos. He became Loos's assistant in 1919 and by the end of 1927 ran a joint architectural practice with Loos as full collaborating partner. In 1927 he married Hilda Beran and they had two children, Richard and Elizabeth (Maru). The young couple was active in the rich intellectual life of Vienna of that time. After Loos died in 1933, Kulka continued his work in Vienna. When the Nazis occupied Austria in 1938 Kulka and his family fled to Czechoslovakia where his wife's family lived. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia he managed to travel to England, being forced to leave his family behind. Thanks to warm letters of recommendation from Jan Masaryk, Arnold Schoenberg and Karen Michaelis he obtained visas for his family and himself to emigrate to New Zealand. After travelling by separate routes he was united with his family in New Zealand. He settled in Auckland where he found employment with the Fletcher Construction Company. He was chief architect at Fletcher's, designing numerous commercial buildings as well as private residences, until his retirement in 1960. From 1960 to his death in 1971 he designed and realised private houses prolifically. He died in Auckland in 1971 aged 71.  Career   Early work  In 1919 after a brief period at the Technical University in Vienna, Henry Kulka began his studies at the Building School of the pioneer modern architect Adolf Loos. Loos emphasized that all architecture should be related to human activity and evolve from it: form follows function. Loos was opposed to unnecessary ornamentation in architecture. He advocated the use of natural unadulterated materials and a respect for skilled craftsmanship. His designs included specifications of internal lining of quality materials such as stone marble and wood. The unique feature of Loos's design was three dimensional planning later named Raumplan by Kulka and described in Kulka's words; ‚ÄúThe rooms of his houses are situated on various levels, inter-related in harmonious proportions, space flowing into space, but forming a compact unit. The levels are not bound to a special floor (ground floor, first floor, etc.) and are not the result of simply dividing a high room into mezzanine parts. The floors are inter-related rooms with open vistas, the levels connected by steps‚ÄùKulka, Henry ‚ÄòAdolf Loos: 1870-1933‚Äô, in Architects‚Äô year book 9, ed. by Trevor Dannatt (London: Elek, 1957), pp. 7-29 (p. 8). Kulka had an affinity for Loos's thinking and an aptitude for three dimensional planning, he became Loos's assistant (1919) and later became his partner (1927), further developing the Raumplan concept. In 1922 Kulka assisted Loos on the realisation of the first cubic Raumplan house, the Villa Rufer in Hietzing Vienna.Weissenbacher, Gerhard, In Hietzing gebaut vol. II (Vienna: Verlag Holzhausen, 1998) Between 1921 and 1922 Kulka designed, autonomously, a cubic Raumplan in smaller cubic dimensions than the Villa Rufer. Kulka's autonomously designed prototype became subsequently known as the Cubic, Dice or W√ºrfelhaus, and was realised in Vienna by Kulka a decade later at 55 K√ºnniglbergasse, Hietzing.Risselada, Max, ed., Raumplan versus Plan Libre, 2nd English edn. (New York: Rizzoli,1988, repr. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2008) During the period 1923‚Äì1927 Kulka worked between Stuttgart, Vienna and Paris. Loos was based in Paris during this period. Kulka collaborated with Ernst Otto Oswald on the winning entry of the competition to design the Stuttgart Tagblatt Tower, which was built in 1927. In 1927 Kulka spent the year heading Loos's office in Paris, leading the design of the Villa Moller Raumplan (after Loos and Kulka's colleague Zlatko Neuman had returned to Zagreb), the Paris Knize fashion boutique and other unrealised projects such as the famous Raumplan Villa for Josephine Baker. In 1928 Kulka and Loos returned to Vienna and ran an atelier as full collaborating partners. Henry Kulka's wife, Hilda Kulka n√©e Beran, was their practice manager during this period. In the last years of his life Loos was less active due to the deterioration of his health. During those years the works often attributed to Loos such as the Khuner house of 1929 in Semmering, Austria were principally designed by Kulka. In the same period Kulka was also involved in planning Villa M√ºller in Prague, and the Wien Werkbund Houses. In 1930 Kulka authored the seminal monograph on Loos's work; 'Adolf Loos: The work of the Architect' published by Anton Schroll Verlag.Heinrich Kulka, Adolf Loos: Das Werk des Architekten, (Vienna: Anton Schroll Verlag, 1931) left Villa Khuner, double level gallery view down to fireplace and dining niche.

After Loos's death in 1933, Kulka continued and expanded their former architectural practice, maintaining their Vienna office and opening a second satellite office in Hradec Kr√°lov√© in Czechoslovakia to service commissions across Bohemia and Moravia. Between 1932-1939 Kulka evolved new cubic Raumplan Villa and Apartment typologies. In addition to functionality, Kulka's approach was humanistic. He considered the feelings of people inhabiting the space of his buildings, striving to give them a sense of harmony and well being. Among these works are the 1932 Weissmann House in Hietzing Vienna, the 1933 Oskar Semler Raumplan Apartment in Pilsen, the 1934 Kantor Cubic Raumplan Villa in Jablonec, the 1934 small mountain Raumplan for Dr. Samuel Teichner in Spicak in Zelezna Ruda and the Villa Holzner Raumplan in Hronov, near Nachod.

Original interior photograph of the Villa Kantor Raumplan designed and realised by Henry Kulka for Dr Kantor in Jablonec Nad Nisou , Czechoslovakia, in 1934. A fine example of Kulka's Raumplan work at this time is the Villa Kantor, 1934. This cubic Raumplan was tailored to the requirements of a medical doctor who needed a functional consulting room nestled within the corpus of a comfortable family home. The exterior envelope of the building is cubic and rendered in fine stucco punctured by symmetrical fenestration in the front fa√ßade and a functional asymmetrical positioning of fenestration at the sides of the house. The symmetry of the fa√ßade is maintained through the use of a classical wall projection which accommodates internal circulation. The interior of the Raumplan villa is clad with light colored woods and marble. The house has larger windows than Kulka's villas with Loos. Kulka lets in more light and incorporates a lighter chromatic selection of cladding materials. It is in the more relaxed and subtle management of spatial transition that the Villa Kantor evolves raumplanning, and points toward changes Kulka would bring to his later work in New Zealand. 482x482px461x461px  Work in New Zealand  Harvey House ‚ÄúFour Winds‚Äô‚Äô, designed by architect Henry Kulka. Wooden private residence for New Zealand industrialist Alex Harvey, Redoubt Road, Manukau, Auckland, New Zealand,1944. Kulka understood that he could not transplant his European mode of operation to New Zealand. He adapted remarkably well to the very different conditions of building, which included climate, construction methods, materials and availability of space. The compact style of building which characterized his more vertically oriented European work became less necessary. He retained many elements which characterized his European houses such as built in seating surrounding a fireplace, built in furniture in the periphery of rooms, raised dining areas opening on living space and flat roofs. He had an extraordinary sense of quality and recognized the beauty of New Zealand wood, lining his houses with fine wooden paneling. Kulka said that he \\"wanted the interiors of his houses to look like the inside of a violin.\\" At first his style was considered to be eccentric and provocative by the public but in later years it became emulated by young modern architects.

Interior view of curved staircase. From 1940 until 1960 Kulka was the chief architect of the Fletcher Construction Company for whom he designed a large number of commercial and public buildings as well as private houses. His designs were diverse: family homes, bungalows, beach houses, bush batches, galleried houses, apartments, libraries, churches and monuments. These were largely realized in New Zealand, although he did build a limited amount of structures through Fletcher Building in Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. Kulka followed changes to building technology closely and employed these new techniques in his commercial designs. Kulka is estimated to have designed and realized over 100 commercial structures throughout the period of New Zealand's post war industrialization.Characteristic features of Kulka's commercial structures include simple, solid facades and the avoidance of structural or decorative exhibitionism. His simple exterior envelopes accorded with a post war mood, which favoured civic modesty and utility. The reception and board rooms of these commercial structures were lined with indigenous wood and stone. Kulka introduced many innovations into his industrial designs including natural lighting and the introduction to New Zealand of the saw tooth factory ceiling. In the E. A Robinson building (1959) Kulka designed a double fenestration system so that offices within the deeper sections of that structure could benefit from internal glass facades which enabled natural light to permeate into these working spaces. In the entrance to Fletcher Building (1941-1942) Kulka designed a dramatic curved staircase lined with light marble and amber native wood.

Designed by Henry Kulka in 1948. South East facing interior lounge view. Privately, Kulka realized over 40 fine wooden houses throughout New Zealand. His wooden houses were innovative in their spatial and material resolution. The Halberstam House in Wellington (1948) is an excellent example of Kulka's ability to design compact minimal dwellings. The single level bungalow sits on top of a small hill in Wellington. It had a very modest construction budget and post war building restrictions were imposed on the commissioners. Notwithstanding these constraints, Kulka built a striking cubic bungalow clad with dark stained weather boards on the exterior with the uplifting surprise of a luminous and calming interior consisting of fine honey coloured native wood panels and clean fibrous plaster. In this modest sized family home a small piano nook is built subtly into the lounge. This nook is separated from the main body of the lounge by the minimal gesture of a bookcase which projects a little into the lounge. A small lowered ceiling above the nook adds to the sense of separateness, snugness of this sub-space. Built in seating on either side of a fireplace are positioned toward the view of northerly hills, and the light. Cosiness, economy and functionality are brought together to achieve a sense of gentle refinement. Notwithstanding the Halberstam villa's more modest scale compared to other Kulka Houses in New Zealand, it remains exemplary of the spirit of his work spatially and materially. Kulka's prolific building continues to influence Modern Architecture in New Zealand. Friedlander House, Masons Avenue, Herne Bay, Auckland, designed by Henry Kulka, 1962.

Description and history The Bloomfield Academy is a two-story brick structure with a gable roof, granite trim, and a granite foundation. It is topped by a two- stage tower, whose first stage is a plain clapboarded square with a simple cornice, and whose second stage has arched louvered openings flanked by pilasters, with an entablature and cornice above. The main (east-facing) facade is three bays wide, with brick piers dividing them. There is a double- door entry in the center, sheltered by an extended hip-roofed hood. The flanking bays have sash windows at both levels, while the second level above the entry as a double sash window. The gable end above is clad in clapboards, and has a semi-oval window in its center.

It was renamed in 1819 when the town it was in was renamed, but it retained that name when Bloomfield was annexed to Skowhegan in 1861. The school's first building was a wood frame structure, which this building replaced in 1840. The builder was Asa Dyer, a noted local brickmaker and master builder. The school was eventually merged into the Skowhegan public schools, and its building is now owned by the Trustees of Bloomfield Academy.

As a rheumatologist, Copeman was influential in the running of the Heberden Society, the foundation and editorship of the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, and the first editor of the Textbook of the Rheumatic Diseases which was first published in 1948. He worked at the Arthur Stanley Institute for Rheumatic Diseases at Middlesex Hospital, as well as being the consultant rheumatologist for the British Army and the Royal Star and Garter Home, Richmond. In 1936, he set up the Empire Rheumatism Council, now known as Arthritis Research UK. As a medical historian, Copeman gave the Fitzpatrick Lectures at the Royal College of Physicians, which formed the content for his 1960 book Doctors and Diseases in Tudor Times. He also published a book on the History of Gout and Rheumatic Diseases which stemmed from lectures given at the University of California at Los Angeles. He was also elected a fellow of the International Academy of the History of Medicine. He was president of the History of Medicine Society at The Royal Society of Medicine, London between 1964 and 1966. During this time, he represented the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries when founding the British Society for the History of Medicine in 1965.

It is dedicated to Saint Martha. Since 1800 it is a Reformed church, the community of which forms part of the Evangelical Reformed Church (regional church). History Medieval windows in the chancel Construction site at the ruins of St. Martha next to the crane Conrad and John of Waldstomer donated the church and the associated hospital in 1363. The church was consecrated on 24 March 1385. From 1390 to 1430, wealthy Nuremberg families donated a series of stained-glass windows to the chancel of the church. As a result of the Reformation the church closed in 1526. It was then used as a theatre by the Nuremberg Meistersingers. In 1614, plays were forbidden in churches, and by 1627 it was restored to use as a church. The church was only lightly damaged during the Second World War, when a bomb hit the roof and chancel arch and by 1946 was back in use. On 5 June 2014, the church was greatly damaged in a fire,Spiegel: 650 Jahre alte Kirche nach Brand einsturzgef√§hrdet and is being rebuilt. Fortunately, the medieval church windows had been removed to storage for renovation work, and should be re-inserted when the church is restored.

It was designed by architect Lars Israel Wahlman in the National Romantic style and completed in 1914. It is one of the largest churches in Stockholm, with 1,400 seats. In the spirit of romantic nationalism, the church was named after Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson ‚Äì a Swedish 15th century rebel leader and national hero. It was built atop a hill in the years 1910‚Äì14, after a design competition held in 1906. The rock on which the church is standing was left mostly intact, in accordance to the urban planning ideals at the time, giving it a naturally elevated position in the city. The building has some features common to Byzantine architecture and has a cruciform architectural plan with a high nave, making it the highest in Scandinavia. Internationally appreciated in architectural circles, the church has not been subjected to any major changes since its inauguration and is regarded as a paragon of the Swedish Art Nouveau era and the National Romantic style.

Chase served two single year terms in the Maine House of Representatives. In 1873, an economic depression began and Chase joined the national Greenback Party. He is credited with founding the Greenback Party in Maine. Chase sought to build an independent movement of farmers and workers through the Greenback Party and opposed electoral fusion with the Maine Democratic Party. A farmer, Chase was nationally known for the catchphrase and stump speech 'them steers'. In 'them steers', he spoke of the tending his steers for the benefit of the financial elite, but not his town, county or state. Upon his death, the New York Times, which was a Republican newspaper, remembered Chase for his unusual stump speeches, noting that \\"during the height of the greenback campaign, Chase stumped the country as far as the Middle West, driving a pair of steers hitched to a hayrack from the rear end of which he delivered his speeches.\\"Solon Chase, Old Greenbacker, Dead, New York Times, November 24, 1909, p. 9 Political career Chase was born in the Chase's Mill area of Turner, Maine in 1823. Chase was a member of the Whig Party prior to the American Civil War. During the Civil War, he joined the Republican Party and served two terms in the Maine House of Representatives. He was appointed an internal revenue collector by President Andrew Johnson, though like most of Johnson's appointments, he was never confirmed. During the June 1880 Greenback National Convention, Chase was a prominent candidate for the presidential nomination. Chase, known as 'the farmer's friend', was nominated by fellow Maine delegate Frank M. Fogg. In the first vote, Chase received 89 votes, which was a distant 5th place from the eventual nominee, Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver. In 1882, Chase was the nominee of the Greenback Party for Governor and received 0.9% (1,324) of the total vote. He ran against Republican nominee and eventual winner Frederick Robie as well as Democrat Harris M. Plaisted. Plaisted was a fusion nominee of the Democratic Party and some in the Greenback Party. Newspaper publishing In January 1875, Chase began published \\"Chase's Chronicle\\" from his farm in Turner. By 1879, the publication had a circulation of 6,000. It then moved to Portland, where it was renamed the \\"Greenback Labor Chronicle\\". However, the Labor Chronicle was discontinued a year later. Just a year later, a stock company owned by Solon Chase created \\"Chase's Enquirer\\". However, in 1882, the company took the paper over from its editor, Chase, and moved the publication to Lewiston. It was suspended within six months. In March 1882, Chase formed yet another newspaper, this called \\"Them Steers\\" in honor of the catchphrase popularized by the editor. Them Steers also failed and the publication ceased to print in 1883. Farming Chase was a lifelong farmer. Notice of Chase's death received special attention in the annual report of the Maine Commissioner of Agriculture, \\"In the death of Solon Chase, which occurred on November 23, 1909, the orchard interests of Maine lost a firm friend.\\" Chase had more than six hundred Northern Spy apple trees in his orchard at the time of his death. The report by Commissioner of Agriculture called Solon Chase the \\"spy\\" king of Maine.

After the Reformation, this was the only Roman Catholic church in the Protestant city of Nuremberg. It soon became inadequate for its congregation, and the church entered into protracted negotiations with the city magistrate, which lasted from 1718 to 1780. Finally agreement was reached for a new church, and the old one was demolished in 1784. Franz Ignaz Michael Neumann, son of Balthasar Neumann, drew up plans for the new building. The foundation stone was laid on 19 May 1785. Neumann died on 29 September 1789, and responsibility was taken over by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt. However, a large overrun in costs led to the resignation of Verschaffelt in 1789. Eventually topping off was completed in 1802 and in 1803 the dome was crowned with a golden cross. In 1806 the church was secularised. On 27 January 1885, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bamberg purchased the church, and further work was done to complete the church to the original plans.

It was announced on 15 July 2014. History After finding a number of flaws in software used by many end-users while researching other problems, such as the critical \\"Heartbleed\\" vulnerability, Google decided to form a full-time team dedicated to finding such vulnerabilities, not only in Google software but any software used by its users. The new project was announced on 15 July 2014 on Google's security blog. When it launched, one of the principal innovations that Project Zero provided was a strict 90-day disclosure deadline along with a publicly visible bugtracker where the vulnerability disclosure process is documented. While the idea for Project Zero can be traced back to 2010, its establishment fits into the larger trend of Google's counter-surveillance initiatives in the wake of the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The team was formerly headed by Chris Evans, previously head of Google's Chrome security team, who subsequently joined Tesla Motors. Other notable members include security researchers Ben Hawkes, Ian Beer and Tavis Ormandy. Hawkes eventually became the team's manager. The team's focus is not just on finding bugs and novel attacks, but also on researching and publicly documenting how such flaws could be exploited in practice. This is done to ensure that defenders have sufficient understanding of attacks; the team keeps an extensive research blog with articles that describe individual attacks in detail. Bug finding and reporting Bugs found by the Project Zero team are reported to the manufacturer and only made publicly visible once a patch has been released or if 90 days have passed without a patch being released. The 90-day-deadline is Google's way of implementing responsible disclosure, giving software companies 90 days to fix a problem before informing the public so that users themselves can take necessary steps to avoid attacks. There have been cases where the vendor neglects to produce any solution for the discovered flaws within 90 days of having been notified, before the public disclosure by the team, thus leaving users of the compromised systems vulnerable. Notable members *Ben Hawkes *Tavis Ormandy *Ian Beer *Jann Horn *Natalie Silvanovich Past members *Gal Beniamini *Thomas Dullien *Chris Evans *George Hotz *Matt Tait *Steven Vittitoe Notable discoveries One of the first Project Zero reports that attracted attention involved a flaw that allowed hackers to take control of software running the Safari browser. For its efforts, the team, specifically Beer, was cited in Apple's brief note of thanks. On 30 September 2014, Google detected a security flaw within Windows 8.1's system call \\"NtApphelpCacheControl\\", which allows a normal user to gain administrative access. Microsoft was notified of the problem immediately but did not fix the problem within 90 days, which meant information about the bug was made publicly available on 29 December 2014. Releasing the bug to the public elicited a response from Microsoft that they are working on the problem. On 9 March 2015, Google Project Zero's blog posted a guest post that disclosed how a previously known hardware flaw in commonly deployed DRAM called Row Hammer could be exploited to escalate privileges for local users. This post spawned a large quantity of follow-up research both in the academic and hardware community. On 19 February 2017, Google discovered a flaw within Cloudflare's reverse proxies, which caused their edge servers to run past the end of a buffer and return memory that contained private information such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data. Some of this data was cached by search engines. A member of the Project Zero team referred to this flaw as Cloudbleed. On 27 March 2017, Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero discovered a vulnerability in the popular password manager LastPass. On 31 March 2017, LastPass announced they had fixed the problem. Project Zero was involved in discovering the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities affecting many modern CPUs, which were discovered in mid-2017 and disclosed in early January 2018. The issue was discovered by Jann Horn independently from the other researchers who reported the security flaw and was scheduled to be published on 9 January 2018 before moving the date up because of growing speculation. On 18 April 2019, Project Zero discovered a bug in Apple iMessage wherein a certain malformed message could cause Springboard to \\"...crash and respawn repeatedly, causing the UI not to be displayed and the phone to stop responding to input.\\" This would completely crash the iPhone's UI making it inoperable.This bug would persist even after a hard reset. The flaw also affected iMessage on Mac with different results. Apple fixed the bug within the 90 day period before Project Zero released it. On 1 February 2019, Project Zero reported to Apple that they had detected a set of five separate and complete iPhone exploit chains affecting iOS 10 through all versions of iOS 12 not targeting specific users but having the ability to infect any user who visited an infected site. A series of hacked sites were being used in indiscriminate watering hole attacks against their visitors which Project Zero estimated receive thousands of visitors per week. Project Zero felt the attacks indicated a group making a sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years. Apple fixed the exploits in the release of iOS 12.1.4 on 7 February 2019, and said the fixes were already underway when reported by Project Zero.

In total, 123 major EU banks participated in the exercise. 24 banks failed the test with an overall capital shortfall of EUR 24.2 billion under the adverse scenario. Background The European Banking Authority (EBA) aims to ensure the proper functioning of financial markets and the stability of the financial system in the EU. To this end, the EBA has the right to conduct the EU-wide stress tests, in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Such exercises are designed to test the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments. The stress tests are performed in cooperation with the ESRB, the European Central Bank (ECB), national competent authorities and the European Commission. In particular, the EBA was responsible for the common methodology and disclosure of the results. The ESRB and the European Commission designed the underlying macroeconomic scenarios. The quality assurance process of banks‚Äô results was led by the ECB and national competent authorities. Moreover, the ECB conducted the Asset Quality Review that served as a starting point of the stress test. In 2014, the ECB performed the Comprehensive Assessment in parallel before taking over its supervisory role in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on November 4, 2014. The results of the stress test were an integral part of the Comprehensive Assessment. Features of the stress test Banks needed to assess the impact of a macroeconomic baseline and adverse scenario. The scenarios each covered a period of three years (2014-2016). The baseline scenario is based on the macroeconomic growth forecast of the European Commission whereas the adverse scenario describes a hypothetical worldwide recession. Risk types considered in the stress test included credit risk, market risk, sovereign risk, securitization and cost of funding. Both trading and banking book assets will be subject to stress, including off-balance sheet exposures. The stress test relied on a static balance sheet assumption implying no new growth and a constant business mix and model over the whole time horizon. Whether a bank passed the stress test was determined according to the resulting Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the baseline and adverse scenario. The definition of CET1 of the CRR/CRD IV (i.e. the implementation of Basel III in the EU) was applied. In order to pass the stress test, banks needed to clear the CET1 hurdle rates of 8% in the baseline scenario and 5.5% in the adverse scenario. Results of the stress test On average, the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of the participating banks dropped by 260 basis points in the adverse scenario, from 11.1% at the end of 2013 after adjustments due to the Asset Quality Review (AQR) to 8.5% at the end of 2016. 24 banks fell below the hurdle rate of 5.5% with an overall capital of 24.2 billion EUR. The main drivers for this impact are credit risk losses and an increase in risk weighted assets. Out of the 24 banks that failed, 9 were from Italy and three from Greece and Cyprus each. Since some banks had raised or converted capital between the starting point of the exercise and the publication date, 13 out of 24 banks remained with a capital shortfall after consideration of these capital measures (remaining shortfall of 9.5 billion EUR). In addition, 16 banks did not clear the hurdle rate of 8% in the baseline scenario after adjustments due to the AQR, with an aggregate shortfall of 9.4 billion EUR.

He was the commander of Jaysh al-Islam (or Army of Islam), a major component of the Islamic Front, of which he was the military chief, and was described as one of the most powerful persons in rebel-held Syria. He was assassinated by a Syrian Air Force airstrike on 25 December 2015 and Essam al-Buwaydhani was named his successor as head of Jaysh al- Islam.Voice of America: \\"Syrian Rebels Mourn Loss of Leader, Name Replacement\\" December 26, 2015 Early life Zahran Alloush was born in Douma, Rif Dimashq, in 1971, and was married to three women. His father was Abdullah Alloush, a scholar and the previous director of Al Assad center for Quoran studies in Damascus. He joined the faculty of law at Damascus University, and completed a master's degree in Shariah law at the Islamic University of Madinah. The Syrian Intelligence Palestine Branch arrested him in 2009 on charges of weapons possession. He was released from Sednaya Prison in 2011 as part of a general amnesty three months into the Syrian Uprising. Syrian Revolution Following his release, he established a rebel group called the Battalion of Islam to fight the Assad Government. The group expanded and renamed itself the Brigade of Islam, and in 2013 it merged with other rebel factions to form Jaysh al-Islam, still under Alloush's leadership. This became the most powerful rebel group operating in the Damascus area. Alloush called for cleansing Damascus of all Alawites and Shiites, later telling Western journalists that these and similar statements had been caused by the pressure and \\"psychological stress\\" he was under from living through the Syrian Government's siege of Ghouta. A number of Syrian opposition figures have accused Alloush of being responsible for the kidnapping of Syrian activist Razan Zeitouneh and her companions in Douma on 9 December 2013. Alloush denied the allegations. In April 2015, Zahran Alloush suddenly appeared in the Turkish city of Istanbul. A spokesperson from the Army of Islam declared that Alloush would meet rebel groups' leaders in Istanbul in order to discuss how to lift the siege in Ghouta. He has been criticized by the public. In the media many wondered how he could travel to Turkey and come back when the city is under siege. Alloush has denounced democracy and called for an Islamic state to succeed Assad, however in a May 2015 interview with McClatchy journalists, Alloush used moderate rhetoric, claiming that Syrians should decide what sort of state they wanted to live under and that Alawites were \\"part of the Syrian people\\" and only those with blood on their hands should be held accountable. His spokesman went on to claim that the sectarian and Islamist rhetoric Alloush had previously made was only intended for internal consumption and to rally his fighters. In July 2015 Alloush accused \\"international forces\\" of waging a media war of jihadists such as his own Jaysh al-Islam. He was reported killed in the village of Utaya to the east of Damascus on 25 December 2015 by a Syrian Air Force airstrike. Kenneth Roth commented on Zahran's death by writing: \\"Killing Alloush is part of Assad strategy of trying to reduce choice to him or ISIL\\".

It is complementary to the pulmonary circulation that brings deoxygenated blood to the lungs and carries oxygenated blood away from them in order to oxygenate the rest of the body. In the bronchial circulation, blood goes through the following steps: #Bronchial arteries that carry oxygenated blood to the lungs #Pulmonary capillaries, where there is exchange of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and many other nutrients and waste chemical substances between blood and the tissues #Veins, where only a minority of the blood goes through bronchial veins, and most of it through pulmonary veins. Infarction of the lung due to a pulmonary embolism Blood reaches from the pulmonary circulation into the lungs for gas exchange to oxygenate the rest of the body tissues. But bronchial circulation supplies fully oxygenated arterial blood to the lung tissues themselves. This blood supplies the bronchi and the pleura to meet their nutritional requirements. Because of the dual blood supply to the lungs from both the bronchial and the pulmonary circulation, this tissue is more resistant to infarction. An occlusion of the bronchial circulation does not cause infarction, but it can still occur in pulmonary embolism when the pulmonary circulation is blocked and the bronchial circulation cannot fully compensate for it.

The Bengali Kayasthas are subdivided into different classes or ranks and also divided in terms of their geographical locations. According to legend, the Bengali Hindu King Ballal Sena started the ranking system of Brahmins and Kayasthas. The highest ranked Brahmins and Kayasthas are known as Kulin Brahmins and Kulin Kayasthas, respectively, and those Kayasthas not considered to be Kulins are designated Maulikas (Mauliks, Mouliks or Moulikas). Bengali Kayastha were subdivided into different classes based on where they lived. Four geographical locations were used for such differentiation - Dakshin Rahri, Uttar Rahri, Bangaj (Bangaja or Vangaja) and Varendra (Barendra). In each region, the Kayasthas were divided into Kulina and Maulika ranks. Among the Kulins of one region there were no more divisions, although Kulin from different regions were considered very different. Depending on the region, same family could be either Kulina or Maulika. Among Dakshin Rarhi Kayasthas, Guha is Maulika, while among Bangaja, Guha is Kulin. On the other hand, depending on the region, Maulikas were further classified into different ranks. Dakshin Rahri Maulika Kayasthas are ranked into only two classes - Siddhya Maulika and Sadhya Maulika. Eight families were classified into Siddhya Maulika class and seventy two families were classified into Sadhya Maulika (also known as bahatture) class.

He was one of the most active Muscovite postcard artists. He produced collections of postcards based on the themes of popular songs and Russian proverbs. He was born in the night between the 21st and 22 April 1880 to the bureaucrat Gavril Viktorovich Sokolov, descended from the petty nobility of the Novgorod Governorate, and his wife Olga Fyodorovna, in a little apartment at 2 Brest street in a three story brick building belonging to the merchants Polyakov. His mother's sister, Evdokia Fyodorovna Simbirskaya was married to Vasily Aleksandrovich Polyakov, one of the brothers who owned the great Znamenskaya Factory. His father died very young and his mother soon remarried, so the young Yevgeny was taken in by his uncle and aunt who raised him and his cousin Sasha. Vasily Aleksandrovich Polyakov was interested in agriculture, so he bought an active estate at Malakhovo in Tulskaya governorate and brought it into model order - Sokolov spent his childhood there. Polyakov sent his son Sasha to gymnasium, but Yevgeny was sent to Komissarov Technical School, where he was taught drawing and sketching by the German Gygo Makker. However, Evgeny Sokolov did not wish to be an engineer and decided to become an artist. In 1898, Sokolov conceived and painted the set for the first performance in the Polyakov theatre The Old Man of Kashira, as well as sketches of the costumes; he personally produced the mockups. When at the Gybaylovo estate, a large manor house with outbuildings, which belonged to the Polyakov brothers, Sokolov regularly met their friends - people who were interested in art. Furthermore, Sokolov became a member of the artistic circle known as the Shmarovin Wednesdays, centred on the managing director of the Polyakov's finances, Vladimir Egovich Shmarovin, who collected pictures and Russian antiques. Every Wednesday Shmarovin gathered painted, writers, poets, artists and interested people at his attic house on Bolshay Molchanovka Street.V.E. Shmarovin (1847-1924) was married to a sister of the Polyakov brothers, Agrafena Aleksandrovna. His meetings were attended by Isaac Levitan. The records of the circle and its collection were transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery. From 1903 to 1906 Sokolov studied painting at the academy of Franz Stuck in Moscow. A year after returning, on 11 October 1907, he married his cousin Tatyana Evert, the second ballerina of the Bolshoi theatre in the Znamenskaya Church in Dubrovitsy.Her mother, Ludmila Viktorvna Sokolov, was his father's sister; her father Aleksandr Yermolaevich Evert, was the brother of Alexei Evert. He began to work in a theatre called \\"Folk House\\" on Novoslodskaya Road in Moscow, which staged classic operas for the education of the masses. Gradually he became known in theatrical circles: he worked at the Korsha Theatre, the Moscow operetta and the Bolshoi theatre and designed more than 300 sets. For the hall of the Moscow Conservatory in the Bolshoi, Sokolov drew oval portraits of composers. He drew illustrations for the satirical magazines Bydilnik and Bolynka. In 1910 Sokolov and his wife went to a tour of Eastern Europe, visiting Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, through Trieste to Venice and visiting Milan, Florence and Rome. They stayed a week on the island of Capri, where they met Maxim Gorky and were guests of the artist Svedomsky at his villa, called Taormina, from Italy they went on to Greece and then to Turkey.

History Since its inauguration in 1974‚Äì75 the league has been the premier club cricket competition in Bangladesh. It gained List A status starting with the 2013‚Äì14 tournament, thus superseding the National Cricket League One-Day as Bangladesh's main List A competition. In the years from 1974‚Äì75 to 2011‚Äì12, Abahani Limited won the championship 17 times. Other winners were Mohammedan Sporting Club nine times, Biman Bangladesh Airlines five times, Victoria Sporting Club four times, Old DOHS Sports Club twice and Brothers Union once. There was no tournament in 2012‚Äì13. To commemorate the centenary of the birth of the founding father of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 2019-20 season of the league was named \\"Bangabandhu Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League 2019-20\\". List A winners Since the tournament gained List A status, the winners have been: * 2013‚Äì14: Gazi Tank Cricketers * 2014‚Äì15: Prime Bank * 2015‚Äì16: Abahani Limited * 2016‚Äì17: Gazi Group Cricketers * 2017‚Äì18: Abahani Limited * 2018‚Äì19: Abahani Limited Format The competition is played as a round-robin, followed by play-off rounds among the top six teams for the championship and among the lowest three teams to determine relegation.

The same three grounds were used in 2017‚Äì18 and 2018‚Äì19, as well as Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur. Players The system of allocating players to clubs varies from season to season, but has elements of lottery. Players frequently change clubs between seasons. Imrul Kayes, for example, played for Victoria Sporting Club in 2006‚Äì07 and 2014‚Äì15, Mohammedan Sporting Club in 2007‚Äì08 and 2011‚Äì12, Gazi Tank Cricketers in 2008‚Äì09 and 2013‚Äì14, Abahani Limited in 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11, Brothers Union in 2015‚Äì16, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club in 2016‚Äì17 and 2019‚Äì20, and Gazi Group Cricketers in 2017‚Äì18 and 2018‚Äì19.

From 2015‚Äì16 only one foreign player has been allowed in any playing eleven, although clubs are allowed to have several foreign players on their list; in 2015-16 36 foreign players took part, including 22 Indians and 10 Sri Lankans. Foreign players were excluded from the 2019-20 competition. Teams There are 12 participating teams, changing each season with promotion and relegation.

(scanned copy available here) Hard copies of the newspaper are distributed in French stores, at consulates, and in schools, in Florida. The first issue of the journal included an exclusive interview with the then-outgoing Consul g√©n√©ral de France √† Miami, Ga√´l de Maisonneuve. Le Courrier de Floride also included interviews of other French officials, such as the new consul of France in Miami, the consul of Canada in Miami, and the first interview of the new ambassador of France to the United States, G√©rard Araud. An interview published at the French consul's website notes that it had been a long time since any French newspaper appeared at a local level in the United States, perhaps not since French-language newspapers in Louisiana ceased publishing in the early 1900s (The New Orleans Bee, which published from 1827 to 1923, has been reported to be the last French-language newspaper of New Orleans.) The newspaper serves a large population (approximately three million) of French- speaking inhabitants and visitors in Florida, including expatriates and immigrants from Haiti and other countries, and numerous French-Canadian Snowbird visitors during the six cold months in Qu√©bec, with many of the snowbirds staying in Broward County communities of Hollywood, Hallandale, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale. French is now the third most widely spoken language in Florida, after English and Spanish, with approximately 500,000 residents in the 2010 census speaking French or French Creole (mostly Haitian Creole) as their first language.2010 U.S. census; see detail in Florida#Demographics. Back in 2003, Florida became the state or province having the second-greatest number of French-speakers, behind only Quebec, passing Ontario. 36% of all French Creole speakers in the U.S., and 4% of all French speakers, lived in Miami in 2007.

He is the founder, chairman and CEO of East Hope Group, a Chinese company active in the agribusiness as well as chemical and non-ferrous metal industries. He is the honorary president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan, a part-time professor at China Agricultural University, MBA lecturer, and a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. Personal life Liu Yongxing was born in Sichuan, China, and has three brothers, Liu Yongyan (ÂàòÊ∞∏Ë®Ä), Chen Yuxin (ÈôàËÇ≤Êñ∞) and Liu Yonghao (ÂàòÊ∞∏Â•Ω), as well as one sister, Liu Yonghong (ÂàòÊ∞∏Á∫¢). They started out as farm workers in low social standing due to their family background as wealthy landlords before the Cultural Revolution. He graduated from Xihua University in 1968. Liu's wife is a psychologist by training, with whom he has one child. He resides in Shanghai.  Career  In the late 1970s, Liu Yongxing and his brothers founded an electronics company that had to close soon after, as such business ventures were regarded as ‚Äútoo capitalistic‚Äù at the time. In 1982, Liu YongXing and his three brothers, accumulated 1,000 RMB and started a company called the ‚ÄúHope Group.‚Äù The business consisted of raising quail and hatching chickens in the Sichuan Province. They also established the Hope Research Center for animal feeds in 1986. In 1995, Hope Group was split up into four separate companies among the siblings: West Hope Group (Chen Yuxin), New Hope Group (Liu Yonghai) and Continental Hope Group (Liu Yongyan). Liu Yongxing retained parts of the agricultural business and got involved in the heavy chemical and aluminium industry, which ultimately led to the founding of today‚Äôs East Hope Group in 1995, one of the largest aluminium producers worldwide. In 1999, Liu Yongxing relocated his East Hope HQ to Shanghai, China. In 2002, Liu Yongxing started his business in the Aluminum industry. In August 2016, Chinese news site Sohu published a profile covering Liu Yongxing and his approach to conducting business. Concerning criticism about environmental pollution caused by East Hope factories, the article quotes Liu as saying that ‚Äúin the heavy chemical industry, environmental issues are a common risk, so I do everything in accordance with the most stringent standards.‚Äù Nevertheless, East Hope Group has been penalized multiple times for violating environmental regulations that included fines, forced production cuts and technical upgrades. For example, punishments were handed out in 2014, 2015 and 2016 for exceeding SO2, NOx and dust emission caps of the Group‚Äôs plants in Shandong, Xinjiang, Henan and Inner Mongolia. In 2015, East Hope's Baotou plant received 4.2 billion yuan in funds to incentivize upgrading its environmental protection facilities, while at the same time, a new kiln for solid waste disposal at one of the company's cement factories was regarded as innovative by Chinese authorities, according to East Hope sources. On 15 December 2016, two people were killed when a red mud reservoir at East Hope‚Äôs Sanmenxia plant failed. Four months prior to the accident, amid another red mud spill incident in the province, the local government conducted safety inspections at East Hope facilities and approved their full compliance with the standards. Thus far, there are no reports that the company has faced repercussions for the accident.  Awards and honors  In 2002, Liu Yongxing was rewarded with the ‚Äú2001 CCTV Top 10 China‚Äôs Economic Leaders‚Äù award, as well as with the ‚ÄúSohu 2001 Top 10 Financial Leaders‚Äù award.  Wealth  Liu Yongxing is regarded among the richest people in China. He was ranked #18 on Forbes‚Äô China Rich List with a net worth of $6.6 billion, which also makes him the richest Shanghai resident. Bloomberg‚Äôs Billionaires Index ranked him at #93 globally with $12.3 billion. His brothers are also billionaires and owners of their own companies.

Early life and education Mary Lund was born on February 13, 1922, to Niels Hansen and Frieda Lund. She grew up in Sacramento, California, where her father was a builder, and she began helping her father design houses at an early age. During her childhood she learned how to sail, and she would go on to win a number of races on the West Coast and elsewhere, including the 1960 Adams Cup sailboat race in Chicago, Illinois. She attended the University of Washington, where she earned a B.A. in architecture in 1945, thereby becoming the first woman to graduate from UW's School of Architecture after WWII. In later years she recalled drawing architectural plans with blackout curtains on the windows. During her undergraduate years, she interned at several architectural firms, including Moore & Massar, Chiarelli & Kirk, and Thomas, Grainger & Thomas, experiences that helped to shape her own modernist aesthetic. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in the state of Washington after World War II. In 1950 she married George L. Davis, Jr., who had been one of her UW classmates in architecture, after which she used her married name of Mary Lund Davis. The couple had two daughters, Katherine and Gail. Career Davis designed both houses and small commercial buildings, with some of her work being done in partnership with her husband and other architects. In 1954, she designed an 800-square-foot cabin for herself in Fircrest; featuring prefabricated panels on post-and-beam framing, it went on to win the 1966 A.I.A.-Sunset Western Home Award. In 1962, she designed the Tacoma Millwork Supply Company Office with Alan Bucholz. She designed a house for her father-in-law that local critics saw as inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1969‚Äì70, Davis designed a large hexagonal house for herself on Wollochet Bay near Gig Harbor with extensive gardens in a style that fuses English and Japanese landscape design aesthetics. The house features retractable sliding panels that function as room dividers and storage units that are hidden from view along an inside corridor. Davis based her design on 120-degree angles, triangles, and circles. Davis's husband inherited a wood-milling business from his father, prompting the couple to experiment extensively with furniture design. Davis's specialty was cabinets and storage spaces, and during the 1950s she drew up build-it- yourself designs for mid-century modern furniture that circulated in booklets distributed nationwide by the Douglas Fir Plywood Association. In the late 1950s, the couple were among the earliest designers to introduce laminates into kitchen cabinets and counters. Davis served as a board member for the Pilchuck Glass School and a trustee (emerita) for Washington's Governor‚Äôs Mansion Foundation and the Tacoma Art Museum. Davis's husband died in 1995, and she died on June 13, 2008, in Rancho Mirage, California. The University of Washington Libraries holds photographs of some of Davis's buildings and models in its collection of images by the architectural photographers Phyllis Dearborn and Robert Massar.

The group was discovered and named by Matthew Flinders on 13 February 1802. The island group has enjoyed protected area status since the 1960s and since 2011, it has been part of the Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area. Description Topgallant Islands is an island group located about south west of Cape Finniss on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, about west by south of the town of Elliston and about east of Flinders Island.DMH, 1985, chart 38 The group consists of an islet and a number of bare rocks which are numbered at seven in one source and which extend from the islet in a line for a distance of about to the south east. The islet which has an area of about , is encircled by high cliffs and has a rounded top whose summit is at above sea level. The southernmost rock is reported as being a ‚Äòsharp pyramid‚Äô of height.Robinson, 1996, page 481 The name used for the island group varies from the name given by Flinders (i.e. Topgallant Isles) as follows: Topgallant Islands, Top-gallant Islands, Top-Gallant Isles and Top Gallant Isles.Robinson et al, 1996, page 193 Access to Topgallant Island by boat is reported as not being possible due to a ‚Äòcombination of deep water swells, steep shores and sheer walls of rotten stone‚Äô.

The Topgallant Islands are part of a submerged reef system orientated along a north north-west axis which extends from the islet in the west to the east of the southernmost rock for a distance of about with ‚Äòsunken rocks‚Äô extending about to the south west of the islet. A depth of is reached within to the west. Flora and fauna Flora Vegetation is restricted generally to the summit of the islet where the soil is sufficiently deep to permit the growth of shrubs and two of the larger rocks. A survey conducted in 1980 found ‚Äòfour distinct plant communities‚Äô to present as ‚Äòlow shrublands‚Äô dominated by chenopods (in two instances), nitre bush and pointed twinleaf. Twenty species were recorded during the 1980 survey including the invasive species African boxthorn and common iceplant. Fauna Vertebrate animals observed on the island group include marbled geckos and the following bird species: Richard's pipit, white-faced heron, Australian kestrel, white-bellied sea-eagle, welcome swallow, silver gull, rock parrot, white-faced storm petrel, short-tailed shearwater and common starling.DEH, 2006, pages 65, 68, 69, 70 & 71 History European discovery and use Flinders discovered the island group on Saturday, 13 February 1802, and named it due to it ‚Äòresembling ships under sail‚Äô.

Mardarije was the first Belgrade printer and last great printer of srbulje books. Mardarije first printed books at the Belgrade printing house in 1552. When its owner gave up the printing business, he moved the printing press to Mrk≈°ina crkva monastery in Kosjeriƒá where he established the Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house.  Belgrade printing house  Mardarije worked as an editor and printer at the Belgrade printing house owned first by Count Radi≈°a Dmitroviƒá and later by Trojan Gunduliƒá. According to some sources, it was Hieromonk Mardarije who inspired first Dmitroviƒá and then Gunduliƒá to invest in the printing business and organized all activities during the set-up of the printing house in Belgrade. In 1552 he printed a Gospel Book (–ß–µ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–æ—ò–µ–≤–∞–Ω—í–µ—ô–µ). Mardarije is the author of the afterword published at the end of the Gospel Book in which he succinctly described how the book came into being, the establishment of the Belgrade printing house and its key people. Mardarije edited this book under great influence of the books published in the Crnojeviƒá printing house.  Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house  When Gunduliƒá gave up printing books, Mardarije moved the printing press from Belgrade to the Mrk≈°ina crkva monastery in Kosjeriƒá and established the Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house in it. Two books were printed in the Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house: a Gospel Book, printed in 1562 and a Flowery Triodon (–¢—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –¶–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏) in 1566. The Flowery Triodon is recognizable because in this book Mardarije preferred to use figural motives instead of the ornaments.  Misidentification with Hegumen Mardarije  In many earlier sources Hieromonk Mardarije is misidentified with Hegumen Mardarije who was also a printer, but in the Mile≈°eva printing house. Taking in consideration that Mardarije of the Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house never referred to himself in his books as a hegumen (a much higher position), it was concluded that Hieromonk Mardarije and Hegumen Mardarije were two different persons.

From 1712 onwards he appears to have held a permanent post in the Ottoboni household but he also served other families of the Roman nobility, and he is thus found among the musicians who performed in George Frederic Handel's La Resurrezione in 1708 in the Palazzo Ruspoli. On this occasion, and on others documented from 1694 onwards, he is referred to as ‚ÄòAntonio del sig.r card.le Colonna‚Äô, which suggests that he had already been in the service of Cardinal Giovanni Paolo Colonna for some time. Between 1695 and 1708 he was in the service of Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili and of the Accademia del Disegno di S Luca. Montanari must have had considerable standing as a violinist, his name always appearing near the top of the lists of players. His reputation was such that Johann Georg Pisendel, who had already studied with Giuseppe Torelli and Antonio Vivaldi, took lessons from him in 1717. In his op. 5 trio sonatas of 1707 Giuseppe Valentini entitled one work La Montanari. He also dedicated a sonnet to Montanari in his collection of Rime, and another sonata by him entitled La Montanari exists in Dresden. The most important single source of biographical information on Antonio Maria Montanari is a commemorative seven- line paragraph squeezed in at the foot of a lightly caricatural pen sketch of the composer by the famous artist Pier Leone Ghezzi: \\"S.r Antonio Montanari virtuossisimo sonator di violino, e poi era accompagniata la virt√π con un costume da angelo il quale mor√¨ alli due di aprile 1737. alle ore 23. e la sua morte √® stata compianta da tutta Roma, et io cav. Ghezzi me ne sono lassata la presente memoria il giorno doppo la sua morte, il quale mor√¨ in 3 giorni di pontura in et√† di anni 62 e fu esposto nella chiesa di S. Apostoli dove gli f√π cantata messa solenne da tutti i professori di musica tanto cantanti, che sonatori, con 12 faccolotti, ove in detta chiesa riposer√† sino al giuditio. Amen. Il med.o nacque alli 29 di novembre del 1676 alle ore 5.\\" According to contemporary sources, Montanari experimented with enharmonic micro-intervals. His high standing as a violinist suggests that he would have had a teacher- pupil relationship with many talented players in Rome, especially after the death of Arcangelo Corelli, including, perhaps, Pietro Antonio Locatelli. Montanari's works have yet to be studied in depth. His Concerti op.1 are exceptionally well crafted, the alliance of virtuosity with solid contrapuntal writing suggesting the possibility of a lineage of post-Corellian solo concerto such as no other composer attempted. Hitherto almost completely ignored, Montanari's concertos rank amongst the most impressive achievements in the Italian repertoire.Simon McVeigh and Jehoash Hirshberg, The Italian Solo Concerto 1700-1760 p. 164  Works  * 1 Sonata in a collection Sonate a violino e violoncello di vari autori (Bologna 1695) * 6 Sonatas for solo violin, cello and basso continuo op. 1 (Le C√®ne, Amsterdam c. 1726; published under the name of Francesco Montanaro) * 8 Concerti op. 1 (Amsterdam c. 1730) * 2 Concerti (Dresden) * other sonatas and chamber music works  Literature  * Michael Talbot: A successor of Corelli: Antonio Montanari and his sonatas.

Mardarije received his education in the Monastery of the Holy Trinity of Pljevlja. To save its liturgical books and other valuables, he moved to Banja Monastery and became its hegumen. In 1543 he and two monks from Mile≈°eva monastery travelled to Venice to buy the printing press and bring it to Mile≈°eva to establish the Mile≈°eva printing house.  Early life  He was a Serb from Podrinje, who descended from Vrane≈°i, Sokolac, Sanjak of Bosnia, Ottoman Empire (modern day Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina). Mardarije was educated in the Monastery of the Holy Trinity of Pljevlja. When he learned that the Ottomans were going to destroy Ljuboviƒëa Church in Pavino Polje, he took liturgical books and other valuables and transported them to Banja Monastery using six loaded horses.  Mile≈°eva printing house  In 1543 Mardarije was a hegumen of the Banja Monastery near Priboj when Todor Ljubaviƒá, a monk in Mile≈°eva and son of Bo≈æidar Ljubaviƒá, was sent to Venice to join his brother ƒêuraƒë and to buy a printing press for the monastery. Todor was accompanied by the Mile≈°eva monk Sava and by Mardarije. At that time Banja Monastery was a seat of the metropolitan bishop while Mile≈°eva was the richest monastery of Dabar eparchy. That is why those two monasteries were given the task to finance and organize establishing of the printing house in Mile≈°eva and why Mardarije travelled to Venice together with monks from Mile≈°eva. The Mile≈°eva printing house was operational in period 1544‚Äì1557. Three books were printed in it, Psalter (–ü—Å–∞–ª—Ç–∏—Ä, 1544), Breviary (–¢—Ä–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫, 1545) and another Psalter (1557). Psalter of 1544 was edited and prepared by Mardarije and Teodor Ljubaviƒá, based on 1519‚Äì20 Psalter of Bo≈æidar Vukoviƒá. In 1545 Mardarije went to Bogovaƒëa near Lajkovac and rebuilt it. An engraved plate commemorates this rebuilding and mentions Mardarije and Vrane≈°i as his fatherland.  Misidentification with hegumen Mardarije  In many earlier sources Hegumen Mardarije who was hegumen of the Banja Monastery is misidentified with Hieromonk Mardarije who was also printer, but in Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house and Belgrade printing house. Taking in consideration that Mardarije of Mrk≈°ina crkva never mentioned in his books his much higher position of the hegumen of Banja monastery, it was concluded that Hegumen Mardarije and Hieromonk Mardarije were two different persons.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1883 to 1884 by James Stuart Martin. It is also known as Caxton Street Hall, Josephsons Clothing Factory, and United Brothers Lodge. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Baroona Hall is a two-storey brick hall constructed in 1884 to a design by Richard Gailey for the United Brothers Lodge of the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows. The building reflects the need for larger premises as membership increases and the desire of the organisation to convey a sense of permanence and stability to its members. Oddfellows societies were established in 17th century England after the demise of the medieval guilds left the working classes completely unprotected in the advent of illness or injury. This led to the formation of friendly societies who banded together to provide, by their own exertions and from their own slender resources, some of the medical and other essential services they lacked. Halls were often constructed by the societies, both as a venue for society meetings, and for use by the community for entertainments, lectures and public and political meetings. There are three orders of Oddfellows, the largest of which is the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows (MUIOOF). This Order was first established in 1813 in Manchester, spreading rapidly through the industrial north of England and then throughout the whole country. The first Oddfellows lodge in Australia was formed in 1840 in Sydney by C M Crighton who was previously a brother of a lodge in Manchester. On 21 August 1847, an advertisement was placed in the Brisbane Courier to those residents who may be desirous of becoming members of the Society of Oddfellows proposed to be established in Brisbane. A lodge was subsequently formed and by 1874, there were twenty two lodges throughout Queensland. Prior to this date, Queensland lodges had been managed as branches of New South Wales lodges; however in 1874, they were granted separation. The Loyal United Brothers Lodge, Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows was established by eleven Brisbane men in 1873. The inaugural meeting was held in the Lennenberg Hotel in Queen Street, and subsequent meetings were held at the Baptist Hall. Many of the foundation members were employed at Smellies Foundry, and others included draymen, wood carvers, and coachmen. In 1878, the lodge purchased land in Caxton Street for and due to increases in membership, decided to erect a hall. The sum of was borrowed towards the cost of construction which amounted to . Together with furniture and regalia, the total cost was approximately . The building was designed by Richard Gailey and constructed by James Stuart Martin, a leading member of the lodge. Construction began in 1883, and the opening was celebrated in February 1884. The design incorporated two shops in the front of the building with a hall at the rear, which was entered from the lane at the side of the building. The hall featured a stage and a gallery, with a lodge room and ante room above the shops. Richard Gailey, the architect, was one of Queensland's most prolific architects. Born in Ireland in 1834, he emigrated to Australia in 1864. Referred to as the doyen of Brisbane's architects, he is responsible for the design of many substantial buildings, both commercial and residential, as well as other society halls including an Oddfellows Hall at Fortitude Valley and a Masonic Hall at Toowong. The hall was utilised by the lodge and the community for a number of years and the shops were continually occupied by a number of small businesses including bakers, stationers, hairdressers, bootmakers and drapers. However, the economic downturn of the 1890s severely overstretched the resources of the lodge, forcing the society to lease the premises to a commercial tenant. In 1918, the hall was leased to Isidor Josephson, a clothing manufacturer. Josephson entered the clothing business in Brisbane at the age of 21, and built a substantial business which eventually extended to most other states. His factory premises at Caxton Street were used as an example of bright, airy factories, fitted with machinery which enlightens the labour (in Barton's Jubilee History of Queensland (1909)). The lodge continued to meet upstairs until 1916 when they moved to the BAFS Dispensary in George Street. The society sold the Caxton Street hall in 1928; however Josephson remained as tenant until 1936 when he moved to new premises in Roma Street. The building remained vacant until the Second World War when it was occupied by the Defence Department Stationer and a hairdresser. It was then vacant again until 1949, when one shop was let by a tailor and the remainder of the building was occupied as the Baroona Labour Hall. The building has also been utilised as a Sunday Market, and the lodge room was used by the Caxton Street Legal Services from 1976. At some stage by 1980, one of the shops was converted into the entrance to the hall. In the late 1980s, the hall was converted for use as a nightclub, and although it has changed hands and images a number of times, it remains in this use.  Description  Baroona Hall is located at the corner of Caxton and Cathie Streets. Constructed of face brick, with a cement rendered front facade and neo-classical detailing, it is located on a sloping site, resulting in it being two storeys at the front and one storey at the rear. Located within a row of 19th century buildings, it has a dominant streetscape presence. The two-storey building has a rendered facade with remnants of paint in some areas and a shop and entrance to the hall at street level. The building is divided by central and end pillars, two of which have had the tiles and render removed to expose badly damaged bricks. The shop, of which the tenant is a tailor, is located on the side nearest Cathie Street. It has a central recessed entrance, with steel framed display windows on either side. There appears to have been few alterations internally. Signage for the store follows the tradition of hand painted signage on the front and end elevations of the awning. The other side of the front elevation incorporates the entrance to the hall, which is located to one side of the central pillar. The remaining space has been boarded up. A curved corrugated iron awning is located over the footpath, supported by three timber posts. Above the awning, the facade is symmetrically arranged, with central and end pilasters. Within the bays on either side of the central pilaster are pairs of semi circular arched windows. Above this section is a panel running the width of the building with the words UNITED BROTHERS LODGE in relief. This is capped with a stone entablature below a parapet featuring an open circular pattern. The parapet is divided by short pedestals surmounted by substantial finials. Between these are two pediments with decorative scrollwork and the badly weathered letters MUI on one and OOF on the other. The uppermost part of the pediments have circular elements featuring symbolic elements of the Oddfellows, including a dove and hands shaking. The elevation to Cathie Street is exposed face brick, with a series of circular and semi circular arched windows. The first three (a small semi circular arched window and two circular windows) are located above three doors with semi circular arched brick headers, of which the central one has been bricked in. Four elongated semi circular arched windows are evenly spaced along the remainder of the elevation. These align with identical windows on the opposite elevation, which are currently boarded up. The rear of the building is one storey high. It comprises a gable end with a central door flanked by two semi-circular arched windows. The windows are boarded up and obscured by a new brick toilet block. The roof is newly sheeted in galvanised iron, with two decorative ventilators located along the ridge. A chimney is evident towards the front of the building. Internally, the new entrance leads to a set of stairs which access the main hall. The walls are plastered and painted, with a shadow line at dado height, which steps up around the location of the original stage. New timber floor boards have been laid over the original boards. The ceiling is of tongue and groove boarding with iron tie rods and is horizontal in the centre and follows the slope of the roof line at the sides. The boarding has been covered with sound proofing materials and is obscured by air conditioning ducts and light and sound apparatus. A new stage on a number of levels is constructed over new toilets at the rear of the hall, and a bar with a mezzanine level above is located along the Cathie Street side. Stairs, possibly with the original timber balustrading lead to the former lodge room from the entrance area. Original doors are located at each end of the wall facing the mezzanine level, with a chimney breast centrally positioned in the same wall. The room has plastered walls and a new tongue and groove boarded ceiling. A bar is located on either side of the wall at the Cathie Street end. Original joinery details survive in most parts of the hall.  Heritage listing  Baroona Labor Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Baroona Hall was constructed between 1883 and 1884 by the United Brothers Lodge, Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows. The lodge was established in 1873, to meet the needs of a large working class population without protection against injury, illness or other hardships. The construction of the hall demonstrates the pattern of Queensland's history by being representative of the considerable and necessary service supplied by Friendly Societies in the 19th and early 20th century community. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is also an uncommon example of a cement rendered building which is unpainted, and also of surviving 1950s style signage to the awning. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The hall demonstrates the principal characteristics of an Oddfellows Hall, including symbols of the society and the division of space into hall, gallery, stage and lodge room. The inclusion of retail premises in front of the hall was also a relatively common feature of community halls. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Baroona Hall has substantial aesthetic significance, both individually, and as part of the streetscape. This is contributed to by the high degree of design, workmanship and materials. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hall has special association with many members of the community, including past and present members of the United Brothers Lodge, and with community groups who used the hall such as the Caxton Street Legal Service. It also has special association with the Australian Labour Party, who used the hall as their branch headquarters from the mid 1940s and are still the owners. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Baroona Hall is also associated with Brisbane architect, Richard Gailey as an example of his work. Gailey was a prolific architect who designed many notable commercial and residential buildings. He also designed other society halls, including an Oddfellows Hall in Fortitude Valley and a Masonic Hall at Toowong.

Its collection includes approximately 900 manuscripts, dating from as early as the 12th century C.E. The library began as the personal collection of the Jerusalemite sharif, Sheikh Mohammad Ibn Budeir Ibn Mohammad Ibn Mahmud Ibn Hubaysh, also known as Ibn al-Hubaysh or Sheikh Budeir (1747-1805). Today, like many of Jerusalem's old family libraries, al-Budeiri seeks to increase scholarly access and awareness of its valuable collection of historical documents through partnerships with international cultural heritage organizations. History Al-Budeiri Library sprung from the personal library of an 18th-century Sufi scholar, Sheikh Mohamed Ibn Budeir Al Budeiri, a man of faith and knowledge who came from a noble family in Jerusalem that lived in the old city for nine hundred years originally from Hijaz, he studied at al-Azhar . He also inherited lots of properties from his father and bought many others on his own which shows the great inherited wealth of Al Budeiri and the honorable family status in Jerusalem . Sheikh Mohamed Ibn Budeir began collecting manuscripts at age 15, and he continually added to his library until his death in 1805. For a long period prior to 2003, the library was shuttered and neglected. The Budeiri family renovated with family members fund and re-opened the library in 2003. Since then, the library acquired and repaired an additional 520 manuscripts, solicited mainly from members of the extended Budeiri family. Al-Budeiri Library continues to operate out of the home of Sheikh Mohamed Ibn Budeir Al Budeiri , as specified in his will. The library is open to the public by appointment. Since late 2008, al-Budeiri's collection has been undergoing preservation and digitization as part of the Manumed Project, itself under the auspices of a collaborative partnership between the European Union-funded program, Euromed Heritage IV, and its local partner, the Arab Studies Society. The collection is now digitized and available for viewing on the website of the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library.http://hmml.org/script_collection/islamic-collection-manuscript- page/http://vhmml.org Collection Al-Budeiri Library's collection includes approximately 900 manuscripts from as early as the 12th century C.E., as well as dozens of printed books from the 20th century, and a host of documents related to the history of the Al Budeiri family, including diaries, personal correspondence, and legal documents dating to the late Ottoman period. The bulk of the manuscript collection is written in Arabic, though there are a few in Ottoman Turkish and Persian. A catalog of the library's manuscript holdings was published in 1987; however this does not include the hundreds of manuscripts acquired since the library's post-2003 revitalization. The 636 manuscripts recorded in the 1987 catalog were copied onto 35 mm microfilm. The library management embarked on the creation of a new comprehensive catalog in spring of 2010, concluding work on the draft catalog in January 2011. According to the Palestinian American Research Center, roughly half of the library's manuscripts are well-preserved, with another quarter needing only rebinding, and the remainder in total or partial disrepair. According to the Manumed Project website, Al-Budeiri's manuscript collection includes 6 unique manuscripts‚àí(meaning that there are no other known copies of the work). The collection also includes 18 manuscripts copied by Sheikh Mohamed Ibn Budeir himself. The oldest manuscript in the collection, \\"The Qasheiri Message,\\" was composed in 1167 C.E. The subject matter of the manuscript collection leans heavily towards Islamic religion, the Qu'ranic sciences, and Sufism. As part of the Manumed Project, 900 manuscripts were digitized. The files and metadata were to be hosted on an online platform developed by the Manumed Project, called the Arabic Manuscripts Digital Library of Jerusalem, as announced by Christopher Graz, project manager of Euromed Heritage IV's regional monitoring and support unit, in June 2012. However, as of January 2015 the Arabic Manuscripts Digital Library of Jerusalem still does not exist; instead the files and metadata of al-Budeiri's digitized manuscript collection are accessible through Manumed's Digital Library of the Mediterranean Sea.

Santa Fe, NM: School of American Research. Arizona Tewa language ideologies Kroskrity's interest in the ideological dimension of language use and their relationship to linguistic structure, cultural identity, and ethnohistory can be traced to the beginning of his career. When he started his dissertation research in the Arizona Tewa communities on the First Mesa Hopi Reservation (Northeastern Arizona) in 1973, Kroskrity was primarily interested in Tewa grammar and language contact, but the Tewa themselves kept reminding him of the importance of the link between language, culture, and religious ceremonies.Paul V. Kroskrity. 1998. Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In Language ideologies: Practice and theory. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn A. Woolard, and Paul V. Kroskrity (eds.), pp. 103-122. New York: Oxford University Press. \\"My language is my life\\" is a popular saying in Tewa, which suggests a strong link between language and identity.Paul V. Kroskrity. 1993. Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.Amy Zaharlick. 1994. \\"Review of Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa by Paul V. Kroskrity.\\" Journal of Linguistic Anthropology 4(2): p.239. Language and identity became a central theme in Kroskrity's later work, interpreting Tewa cultural phenomena in the light of the emerging theory of language ideology. His early research concentrated on linguistic variation, language contact, linguistic borrowing, and areal influences in Tewa. The Tewa language presents unique data for the study of language contact because despite a history of about 300 years of contact with their Hopi neighbors and widespread multilingualism, the Arizona Tewa have adopted almost no loanwords from Hopi.David L. Shaul. 1996. \\"Review of Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa by Paul V. Kroskrity.\\" Language in Society 25(1): pp.151-156. This is a common pattern in many Pueblo cultures, usually known as \\"linguistic conservatism\\".Joel Sherzer. 1976. An Areal-Typological Study of American Indian Languages North of Mexico. Amsterdam: North-Holland. Kroskrity re- analyzed this pattern as an indigenous ideology of Linguistic purism. But rather than being a result of the rejection of foreign elements by the Tewa community, Kroskrity traces this ideology to the prominence of kiva speech, a type of ceremonial speech confined in its use to religious authorities.Michael Silverstein. 1998. \\"Contemporary transformations of local linguistic communities.\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 27: p.417 Associated with the highly valued religious domain, kiva speech embodies four cultural preferences: regulation by convention, indigenous purism, strict compartmentalization, and linguistic indexing of identity.Willem J. de Reuse. 1995. \\"Review of Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa by Paul V. Kroskrity.\\" Anthropological Linguistics 37(2): pp.219-222. These preferences are reflected in Arizona Tewa linguistic ideologies concerning non-kiva language as well, and turn kiva speech thus into a folk model for language in general. Kroskrity has coined the term \\"dominant language ideology\\" to describe these underlying conceptions of language, where linguistic and cultural forms specific to one domain come to serve as a model for other forms. In relation to research on the relative metalinguistic awareness that speakers have of their language, Kroskrity points out that this dominant ideology is most influential on the Tewa lexicon, since lexical differences are most accessible to awarenessMichael Silverstein. 1981. \\"The limits of awareness.\\" Sociolinguistic Working Paper Number 84. and therefore most easily controlled by the speakers.Greg Urban. 1995. \\"Review of Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa by Paul V. Kroskrity.\\" American Anthropologist 97(2): p.392. Western Mono language ideologies In addition to research with the Arizona Tewa, Kroskrity has also worked with the Western Mono communities of central California since 1980. In stark contrast to the Arizona Tewa, linguistic purism was absent in the Western Mono communities. Kroskrity identifies three precolonial language ideologies: syncretism, the valorization of linguistic borrowings and hybridity; variationism, that dialectal variation is seen as the natural outcome of family and individual differences; and utilitarianism, the idea of language as tool or technology. These ideologies have most likely contributed to language shift toward English. In precolonial times among indigenous groups on the Pacific coast of the present-day United States, lexical borrowings between different languages were common and not perceived as dangerous to the vitality of any language, let alone ethnic identity. In this context, the adoption of English items into the lexicon of Western Mono was welcomed rather than condemned, partly because the Western Mono language was never indexical or iconic of a unified ethnic identity, owing to internal differentiation; and partly because in colonial and post- colonial society, English was becoming increasingly useful. These traditional language ideologies alongside educational politics proved to be detrimental to language maintenance.Paul V. Kroskrity. 2002. \\"Language Renewal and the Technologies of Literacy and Postliteracy.\\" In Making Dictionaries: Preserving indigenous languages of the Americas, eds. William Frawley, Kenneth Hill, and Pamela Munro. Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, pp.171-192.Paul V. Kroskrity. 2009. \\"Embodying the Reversal of Language Shift. Agency, Incorporation, and Language Ideological Change in the Western Mono Community of Central California.\\" In Native American Language Ideologies. Beliefs, Practices, and Struggles in Indian Country, eds. Paul V. Kroskrity and Margaret C. Field. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, pp.190-210. Language ideological clarification Kroskrity's work demonstrates the importance of language ideologies for understanding language maintenance and shift.Paul V. Kroskrity and Margaret Field (eds.). 2009. Regimes of Language. Beliefs, Practices, and Struggles in Indian Country. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. While in the case of the Arizona Tewa, a dominant language ideology of purism and an association of the Tewa language with ethnic identity has contributed to language maintenance, the traditional language ideologies of the Western Mono have contributed to rapid language shift. In light of these findings, Kroskrity has more recently called for \\"language ideological clarification\\". ::Language ideological clarification is the process of identifying issues of language ideological contestation within a heritage language community, including both beliefs and feelings that are indigenous to that community and those introduced by outsiders (such as linguists and government officials), that can negatively impact community efforts to successfully engage in language maintenance and renewal. This process of identifying and raising consciousness about linguistic and discursive issues enables appropriate discourses to occur between community members, or between members and either linguists or government officials who have differing opinions. Ideally these discourses would promote actual resolution‚Äîa clarification achieved‚Äîor foster a tolerable level of disagreement that would not inhibit language renewal activities.Paul V.

Encouragement, Guidance and Lessons Learned, eds. Jon Reyhner and Louise Lockard. Flagstaff, Arizona: Northern Arizona University, p.73. Collaborative fieldwork Throughout his career Kroskrity has contributed through research to the agendas of the communities he studies. He conducted \\"collaborative research\\" with Tewa and Western Mono informants long before the term became fashionable in anthropology.For example: with Dewey Healing (Tewa). 1978. \\"Coyote and Bull snake.\\" In William Bright (ed.)

Bentall and her husband, John Bentall, inherited the rose fields of acclaimed rose breeder, the Reverend Joseph Pemberton after his death in 1926. The rose was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit in 1993. History The Reverend Joseph Pemberton (1852-1926), Anglican clergyman and rose hybridizer is recognized for creating the Hybrid musk class of roses. He established the Pemberton Nursery at Romford, Essex after his retirement from the clergy in 1914. His primary focus in rose breeding was the development of modern roses similar to the old fashioned, musk scented roses that his grandmother grew in her garden. His rose breeding program was a great success, and at the time of his death, the Pemberton nursery had rose sales of 35,000 to 40,000 annually. In his will, Pemberton bequeathed the Pemberton rose fields to his two long time nursery gardeners, John Bentall and Mr. Spruzen.. Ann Bentall was a passionate and experienced gardener and rose breeder. She and John Bentall bred and sold roses commercially in the late 1920's and 1930's. The hybridization of 'Buff Beauty' has often been attributed to John Bentall or Joseph Pemberton, with Ann credited only with the introduction of the rose in 1939, after her husband's death. Ann Bental is currently recognized as the creator of 'Buff Beauty'. According to author Peter Schneider, \\"Even though she (Ann) bred two of the five most widely grown roses in the world today ('The Fairy' and the pink-and-white hybrid musk 'Ballerina'), Ann Bentall has never been admitted into the pantheon of 'Great Hybridizers'. Description 'Buff Beauty' is a vigorous spreading medium shrub, 4 to 10 ft (120-305 cm) in height, with a spread of 4 to 8 ft. (120-245 cm). The plant bears large, nodding clusters of medium, semi-double flowers with a strong tea rose fragrance. Blooms have an average diameter of 3 in (10-15 cm) and can have 40 to 50 petals. Flower color varies from buff yellow, apricot and apricot-blend to orange. 'Buff Beauty' blooms in flushes from summer to fall. The shrub grows in long arching, smooth stems bearing glossy, dark green foliage. Flowers repeat throughout the season. The plant is heat tolerant and grows well in the shade. It makes an excellent climber and is hardy in zones 4 to 9.  Awards  'Buff Beauty' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (1993), as well as the American Rose Society's Classic Shrub Rose Award at the East Bay Rose Society Show and the Temecula Valley Rose Society Show.

CCLL also organized protests, rallies and boikots against the construvtion of dams in the Galician rivers, that flooded entire parroquias. A sector of the union, close to the Galician Socialist Party (PSG), split in 1975 and formed a new organization, the Sindicato Agrario Galego (SAG, Galician Agrarian Union)D√≠az- Geada, A., & Taboada Casteleiro, A. (2014). Sindicalismo nacionalista en el rural gallego del tardofranquismo y la transici√≥n (1973-1978): discurso y pr√°ctica para la democracia desde el campo. Historia, Trabajo y Sociedad, n¬∫ 5. pp. 106. ISSN: 2172-2749106. In 1976, CCLL created the Galician Agrarian Association (AGA) as their legal wing, thanks to the new association laws. Despite this, the first General Assembly of the AGA was banned by the authorities. The same year a group of dissidents, that were opposed to the Galician People's Union policies, left CCLL and formed Comisi√≥s Labregas- Terra. The same year Comisi√≥s Labregas decided to adopt the name Comisi√≥s Labregas-Sindicato Labrego Galego (although the union maintained the acronym CCLL). Legalization and growth: 1977‚Äì1986 In 1977 three milestones happened in the history of CCLL. The union was legalized in the spring of that year, due to that AGA was disbanded. The same year a hughe conflict between peasants and inhabitants of the parroquia of As Encrobas, Cerceda and the electric company Fenosa erupted. Fenosa expropriated land of the locals to mine lignite. The inhabitants of As Encrobas were against the expropriations. The local CCLL organized a hughe protest that transforms a local conflict into a problem of all Galiza. The peasants were led by Moncho Valcarce, the local priest and member of the Galician People's Union.Nieves Herrero P√©rez (2008), El conflicto de As Encrobas (1976‚Äì1979). La prensa gallega y la representaci√≥n de la identidad campesina. The resistance of the locals against Fenosa and the Guardia Civil became a symbol of the Galician peasants struggle. In 1978 Fenosa the CCLL and the As Encrobas were finally defeated and the mine was built. The other main event of 1977 was the opposition to the Nuclear power plant of Xove. That year a hughe movement opposing the construction of the plant started. CCLL and ADEGA were the main organizars, although the Galician National-Popular Bloc also played a key role. On 10 April 1977 8,000 people marched from Viveiro to Xove against the plant. The struggle against the nuclear power plant continued until 1979 when, due to the popular pressure (including another Anti-nuclear March with 20,000 participants), the electric company decided not to build the plant there. In 1978 elections to the C√°maras AgrariasThe Chambers of Agriculture, were the peasants and farmers were represented in Spain. CCLL gained 545 representatives in Galicia. The same tear the CCLL launched a campaign against the Cuota Empresarial, the company contribution, an amount of money that the Galician farmers had to pay to the social security despite the small a familiar character of their farms. This tax was considered abusive by the majority of the Galician farmers at the time. The CCLL supported not paying the tax, which led to a mass civil disobedience movement against the cuota. After 16 years of protests, in 1994, the Spanish government abolished the cuota. Since 1986: opposition to the CAP and greater organizational independence CCLL was against the entrance of Galicia in the common market, due to the dismantlement the Galician agrarian productive sectors faced with the Common Agricultural Policy. In fact, milk quotas and new taxes damaged the Galician agrarian sector during the second half of the 80s, which saw the closing of many farms. The struggle against the milk quotas and taxes became the new focus of the CCLL. In 1989 the organization changed its name to Sindicato Labrego Galego-Comisi√≥ns Labregas and its acronym to SLG. The same year Lidia Senra became the leader of the SLG, and remained in that position until 2007. In the late 1990s the organization became more independent of the Galician People's Union and of the Galician Nationalist Bloc. The SLG joined Via Campesina and helped to create the anti-globalization movement in Galicia. The union also adopted a policy of promoting food sovereignty. During the 90s the fight against the Common Agricultural Policy continued, with work stoppages, demonstrations and tractoradas (demonstrations of tractors for the purpose of blockading roads). During the 2000s there was an internal tension between the supporters of the Galician People's Union (UPG) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc and the sector that wanted a fully independent union. In 2009 the supporters of the UPG split and formed a new union, the FRUGA. The SLG has continued to participate in the social movements since then, being one of the main organizers of the protests against the gold mine in Coristanco in 2013. Due to the massive opposition to the project, the Xunta de Galicia decided not to give the license to the mining company. References * Beramendi, J e N√∫√±ez Seixas (1995): O Nacionalismo Galego.

It was equipped with an 81 mm M1 mortar and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced. It mainly served on the Western Front in Normandy, and Southern France, and then later in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. It was deemed to have been outclassed in 1945 when the 81 mm M1 mortar was found to have insufficient power to provide effective artillery support.  Specifications  The specifications for the M21 are similar to the specifications for its parent vehicle, the M3 Half-track. The vehicle was long, wide, and highNess (2002), p. 207. with a wheelbase of .Berndt (1993), p. 152. The suspension for the front wheels were leaf springs and track's suspension used a vertical volute spring. Powered by a White 160AX, , , 6-cylinder petrol engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1, the M21 could reach up to on a road.Norris (2012) The fuel capacity was and the vehicle had a range of . It had a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8 hp/ton with the vehicle weighing nine tons.  Design  The M21 had a different layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, as it was the replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front). The mortar was able to traverse 30¬∞ either side and elevate from 40 to 80¬∞. If required, it could be de-mounted from the vehicle and fired from the ground. In addition, there was a pedestal mount at the rear for a .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 189.  Development  The M4 was developed to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 188. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front. The Ordnance Department followed suit and a new 81 mm MMC, the T19 MMC, was created, which was based on the M3 Half-track. The T19 went through its developmental trials, which were completed in July 1943, and the vehicle was later standardized as the M21 MMC.Zaloga (1994), p. 43. Unlike the M4 mortar carriage, which was based on the M2 Half Track Car, the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track with a longer and roomier rear.Doyle (2003), p. 289Foss (1987), p. 419.  Service history  The M21 served on the Western Front, seeing action in Normandy and in southern France, before later being used during the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Belgium, Operation Market Garden, and the invasion of Germany from the west. The M21 served with the US 3rd, 1st, and 7th Armies during the campaign in France, and the 2nd Armored Division, which developed it.Doyle (2003), p. 391 In addition, 57 examples were leased to Free French forces. By 1945, it was declared obsolete, due to the insufficient power of the 81 mm mortar as an artillery piece.Hunnicutt (1992), p. 342.  Usage  Standard US tank and armored infantry battalions had a mortar platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets at night or provide indirect fire support to the infantry. The usage was uncommon because the White Motor CompanyZaloga (2013), p. 26. was only able to produce 110 M21s in 1944.Ness (2002), p. 193.Berndt (1994), p. 24.

It was released on August 13, 2008, under Vives' label Gaira M√∫sica Local. The album came into fruition when Rafael Pombo Foundation president Juanita Santos asked Vives to craft a musical that uses Pombo's most iconic poems and fables he created. Its music incorporates a variety of Colombian folk genres and mixes in contemporary genres like Latin pop and pop rock. Among the 14 tracks present in the album, only one was released as a single, \\"El Modelo Alfab√©tico\\" (). All the lyrics were written originally by Rafael Pombo, and produced by Vives. Pombo Musical was well-received, and was certified platinum in Colombia by the Asociaci√≥n Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas (ASINCOL). It also won some accolades, including a Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Children's Album, and a Premio Shock for Best Compilation. Background After finishing the promotion of his previous studio album El Rock de Mi Pueblo (2004), Vives ended his music contract with EMI Latin and took a hiatus, for concentrating on supporting local artists as a producer and songwriter. He then met Juanita Santos, the president of Rafael Pombo Foundation, who asked them to present a proposal for a musical that uses the most iconic poems and fables created by Pombo. Motivated by this, they began to study many books about Pombo and his works. The creation of Pombo Musical began as a studio project in house between old friends, Carlos Ivan Medina, Carlos Huertas and Ernesto \\"Teto\\" Ocampo. He stated: \\"Before we worked musically on some of Rafael Pombo's works, without thinking about making a record, but because somebody had done a melody of Rin Rin\\". Together with Medina, Vives made a melody for \\"Modelo Alfab√©tico\\". On July 24, 2008, Vives released \\"El Modelo Alfab√©tico\\", a song based on a poem by Pombo, with influences of cumbia and rock as the album's lead single. The recording of the album took two years, due to the number of artists contributing to it, namely, Juanes, Aterciopelados, Fonseca, Santiago Cruz, Ver√≥nica Orozco, D√∫o Huellas, Ilona, Eduardo Arias & Karl Troller, Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iv√°n Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Fundaci√≥n Batuta Chorus, Distrito Especial, H2 El Guajiro, Adriana Lucia, Guillermo Vives and Julio Navas. The music launch was held in Gaira Caf√© Cumbia House bar in Bogot√°, Colombia on August 13, 2008. Composition The record was produced by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs from a variety of Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, \\"El Modelo Alfab√©tico\\" (\\"The Model Alphabetical\\"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the D√∫o Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl Troller, about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. \\"El Renacuajo Paseador\\" (\\"The Tadpole Walker\\"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iv√°n Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, D√∫o Huellas, Fundaci√≥n Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named \\"Rin Rin\\", that left his home without the approval of his mother \\"Rana\\" (\\"Frog\\"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on \\"El Gato Bandido\\" (\\"The Bandit Cat\\"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering that things are not easy by yourself, and returns feeling repentant.

Khentkaus was very likely a daughter of king Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, while her husband was equally likely pharaoh Neferefre, and her son the future pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu. Discovery of the tomb On January 4, 2015, the discovery of her tomb by Czech archaeologists was announced by Egyptian authorities. According to Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty, there had been no knowledge of the existence of Khentkaus III before this discovery. Two earlier Egyptian queens with the same name have been identified previously, however. The tomb of Khentkaus III ‚Äì marked as AC 30 ‚Äì was excavated in Abusir, where there are several pyramids dedicated to pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty, including Neferefre. The tomb was found near Neferefre's funerary complex by a Czech archaeological team led by Miroslav B√°rta of Charles University in Prague, with Egyptian collaboration. The name and rank of Khentkaus was inscribed on the inner walls of the tomb, probably by the builders. Her burial place is a mastaba with an underground burial chamber that is reached via a shaft. The reliefs in the tomb identified her both as \\"the wife of the king\\" and \\"the mother of the king\\", implying her son ascended the throne. Statuettes and twenty-four travertine utensils, along with four copper utensils (which were part of the funerary objects), also have been found in the tomb. The tomb is dated to the middle of the Fifth Dynasty. The archaeologists who uncovered the tomb believed it to be that of Neferefre's wife, because it was close to his complex, in a small cemetery southeast of the complex. Eldamaty stated: \\"This discovery will help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids.\\"  Tomb  Prior to being excavated, tomb AC 30 appeared to be an elongated, north-south oriented mound ‚Äì later confirmed to be a mastaba ‚Äì long by wide and with a maximal elevation of . Indications of severe damage due to the practice of stone thieving were immediately identifiable from the debris. This is in keeping with the state of other tombs in the Abusir necropolis. The floor of the tomb's courtyard was covered in a layer of mud and admixture of gravel. In contrast with AC 29, AC 30 does not appear to have a lower level of mud floor. The mastaba was found to be long by , with masonry preserved up to a height of . It had an offering chapel, and a vertical shaft through which the substructure was accessed. The superstructure's outer faces were built from yellow and grey limestone which had been locally quarried, and joined using a mud and lime mortar. Its inner core structure was of mediocre quality, predominantly consisted of limestone debris, mudbrick and significant quantities of pottery. This structure was then encased with massive, but poor quality, white limestone blocks that had not been smoothed. This indicates that construction was abandoned prior to completion after the owner's death. The superstructure is entered on the eastern fa√ßade through a wide entryway giving access to a by L-shaped chapel. The entrance sidewalls were built from fine quality white limestone, and the chapel originally contained two false doors on its western wall, but stone thieves have severely damaged the chapel's masonry. The method of construction of the chapel indicates that it was built in the latter half of the Fifth Dynasty. Overall, the tomb is smaller among the social elite and royal family tombs in Abusir. The vertical shaft, for entering the substructure, was found behind the northern false door inside the chapel. Its maximum preserved depth is , and its side walls are in a reasonable state of preservation ‚Äì only the upper part of the south wall has been destroyed. Inside, a small b·∏è3-mould, parts of a calf, shards of pottery, charcoal, wooden fragments, and rope segments were discovered. In the southern wall of the shaft, a narrow passage long, wide and high gives access to the burial chamber. A sloping ramp fashioned from limestone fragments led into the burial chamber, and had been evidently used to transport the mummy into the tomb. The burial chamber itself measured long, wide and tall. It had, at one point, a nearly flat ceiling, but this has been destroyed. A single, massive limestone block has been retained in situ in the chamber's westernmost area. Its size indicates the tomb belongs to a royal family member. The chamber also originally contained a sarcophagus built of white limestone in its western area, but it too has been destroyed. Remains of the burial discovered include 23 travertine model vessels, 2 white limestone lids, presumably belonging to canopic jars, 4 copper models of tools, animal bones, fragments of wooden items, bandages and cloth ‚Äì from the embalming process. The quality of craftsmanship on these items is high. Two types of pottery were discovered inside the tomb, the first belonged to the core masonry of the structure ‚Äì reducing construction time and expense ‚Äì, the second from the practice of the mortuary cult. Skeletal fragments of the owner were recovered during the excavations. Anthropological analysis of the fragments identified the tomb owner as a female are 20 years of age. The owner of the tomb could only be identified through Baugraffiti. These were found in the side walls of the chapel and shaft, the substructure pavement and in the passage connecting the burial chamber with the shaft. Information acquired from the Baugraffiti included construction dates, the owner's name, and her titles. The abbreviated variant of her name ·∏™nt had been found in the space above her burial chamber, but not above the ceiling level. Her full name and titles have been identified as ·∏•mt nswt and mwt nswt ·∏™nt-k3w.s. It is unlikely that these blocks originated from the Pyramid of Khentkaus II, as the titles on the blocks in this tomb are uniform, which they aren't in Khentkaus II's, and no such blocks appear in the other nearby tombs of AC 25 and AC 29. Due to the positioning of the tomb near to Neferefre's unfinished pyramid, it becomes probable that she was a spouse of his. Significantly, her title \\"mother of the king\\" indicates that her progeny had been a successor to the Egyptian throne. Although this son is not identified in the epigraphy of her tomb, it is most likely that the king in question is either Menkauhor or the ephemeral Shepseskare.

Smallpeice, as financial comptroller and later, managing director, was one of the board of BOAC who was instrumental in purchasing and introducing jet powered aircraft into passenger service. He was responsible for the purchase of the de Havilland Comet, the Boeing 707 and the Vickers VC10. His time at BOAC included the introduction of the Comet 1, the subsequent Comet disasters where metal fatigue caused the in-flight destruction of three aircraft, with a loss of 99 passengers and crew, the re-introduction of the Comet 4 and the inauguration of the first jet-powered transatlantic services in October 1958. He would later be instrumental in the purchase of the Boeing 707, which introduced the first by-pass turbofan engine, the Rolls-Royce Conway into passenger service. He left BOAC along with his chairman Matthew Slattery, over disagreements with the Government concerning financial support in return for purchasing the Vickers VC10. He moved to Cunard as a director and then chairman, where he was responsible for radically altering the passenger and freight operations of the business; on the passenger side of the business, he cut massive losses by selling the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth liners, then oversaw the radical re-design of the replacement liner the Queen Elizabeth 2, which was under construction when he took up his position with Cunard. The changes he oversaw allowed the Queen Elizabeth 2 to become a profitable luxury liner for the company. His work on the freight size of the business included the containerisation of the business together with the amalgamation of smaller lines and the formation of joint ventures which would be needed to operate larger container ships. He was chairman of Cunard when the Atlantic Conveyor was ordered and launched as part of Cunard's contribution to the Atlantic Container Line joint-venture. His final major business appointment was as a non-executive director of Lonhro, where soon after he took office, he uncovered illicit payments to Duncan Sandys and further impropriety undertaken by chief executive Tiny Rowland, who had committed company funds to projects without the agreement of the board and granted share options to other sympathetic board members. Smallpeice and seven fellow directors attempted to remove Rowlands from office on the grounds of his behaviour, but he managed to out-manoeuvre them by obtaining a temporary injunction preventing his removal. The Prime Minister Edward Heath considered Rowland's behaviour to be \\"the unacceptable face of capitalism\\" and despite support for Smallpeice and his fellow directors in the press and in the City, where they were dubbed \\"the straight eight\\", they all resigned at a subsequent extraordinary general meeting later in 1973. Smallpeice also held a post as an administrative advisor to the household of Elizabeth II. He became well known and trusted by the Queen as a result of his work with BOAC organising flights and aircraft for the Royal family, including the flight which took Princess Elizabeth to Kenya at the end of January 1952 and returned her as Queen several days later. Early life Smallpeice was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 18 September 1906. His father was Herbert Charles Smallpeice and his mother was Georgina Ruth Smallpeice (n√©e Rust). Herbert Smallpeice was a senior clerk with the London and River Plate Bank, a British bank which conducted business in South America. Basil contracted malaria whilst in South America and was returned to Britain. He was privately schooled whilst in Britain, initially at Hurstpierpoint College, then at Shrewsbury School, before joining Bullimore and Co., an accountancy firm based in London and Norwich, as an articled clerk. Smallpeice qualified as an accountant in 1930, and undertook the University of London Bachelor of Commerce degree whilst training. Business career Smallpeice was initially employed by The Hoover Company from 1931 to 1937 as an accountant and assistant secretary, before moving to Royal Doulton as their chief accountant and secretary, where he stayed until 1948. He served as acting managing director during World War II when Royal Doulton's managing director, retired Royal Navy officer Basil Green, returned to active service. Royal Doulton was covered by an essential work order and Smallpeice's role considered a reserved occupation, restricting him from active military service, though he was permitted to serve with the Home Guard. Basil Green's short return during the Phoney War of 1939 allowed Smallpeice to take up a position with HM Treasury, working with the Organisation and Methods Division, but Green was again recalled to active service when Germany invaded the Low Countries, with Smallpeice returning to Doulton's. He and like-minded accountants in the same position would spend much of their spare time during the war writing papers on accountancy, taxation and management, with one paper, entitled \\"The Future of Auditing\\" provoking a strong response amongst Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) members when it was published in their journal, The Accountant in 1941. This would lead to the formation of the Taxation and Financial Relations Committee at the ICAEW in 1942, and Smallpeice would be one of the first members to join that committee. He would join the board of the Office Management Association prior to that. Smallpeice, with support from E. H. Carr who was then assistant editor of The Times, promoted the idea of employers deducting income tax from wages and passing it to Government directly rather than waiting for employees to do so at the end of the financial year. He introduced this idea to Paul Chambers, then on the board of the Inland Revenue. The idea, which became the PAYE system, would be tested in 1940‚Äì1941 and introduced permanently in 1944. The system vastly simplified and increased tax collection during the latter stages of World War II, when Britain was in desperate need of funds. Smallpeice would, whilst working at Doulton's, involve himself further in the ICAEW, promoting rule changes which would allow chartered accountants working in industry to sit on the ICAEW council, and being eligible to be Fellows of the Institute. This would lead to him serving on the ICAEW council from 1948 to 1957. British Transport Commission Smallpeice left Doulton's in 1948 when it became clear he wouldn't be offered a board position with the company, and moved to join fellow accountant Reginald Wilson at the state owned British Transport Commission (BTC). Wilson, as comptroller, offered Smallpeice the role of Director of Costs and Statistics, but within two years, Smallpeice grew to realise that the business, with 600,000 staff, was effectively unmanageable without support from government and he began to assess his options elsewhere. He spoke to Harold Howitt when he was thinking of leaving the BTC and was informed that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would be similar to the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company. BOAC Smallpeice was instrumental in the decision to purchase the jet powered de Havilland Comet Smallpeice formally joined BOAC on 1 January 1950, taking the title and role of financial comptroller. The title reflected his intention to provide useful financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take informed decisions, rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial comptroller position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice was appointed to the board. He would then be promoted to the additional position of deputy chief executive in June 1954. He was instrumental in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director. d'Erlanger and Smallpeice, who developed a particularly strong working relationship, were supporters of the British aviation industry, pursuing British built aircraft for BOAC. Smallpeice in particular had been a strong supporter of de Havilland throughout the period of the Comet crashes and re-introduction to service, but concerns about the reintroduction of the Comet, delays with the Bristol Britannia and a lack of any other suitable British aircraft nearing production would force BOAC into purchasing the Boeing 707 aircraft. Smallpeice was instrumental in their purchase, discreetly arranging for BOAC staff to visit America and examine the Boeing 367-80 prototype before persuading the government to authorise the purchase, as was necessary at the time. Boeing's jet powered 707, an aircraft Smallpeice was also instrumental in BOAC purchasing The purchase of the Boeing 707 aircraft would be followed by several orders for Vickers competing design, the VC10, with BOAC having ordered 35 VC10 aircraft by 1959 and an additional ten (bringing the total on order to 45) by 1961. Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and a whole host of additional costs associated with the Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards. It was during this period that Smallpeice began to work with Sir Edward Fielden, Captain of the Queen's Flight on arrangements to fly Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family overseas on BOAC aircraft. Smallpeice, who generally took personal responsibility for the organisation of these flights, was recognised for this work in 1961 when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. d'Erlanger retired as chairman in 1960, and was succeeded by Matthew Slattery. Smallpeice remained as managing director, and together Slattery and Smallpeice set about cutting costs at the airline as the financial performance continued to deteriorate. BOAC would incur significant losses in 1961 and 1962 amidst decreasing passenger loadings, comparatively high maintenance costs and ongoing payments to Vickers for the VC10 orders. The financial situation was further endangered by competition from independent British operation Cunard Eagle Airways, a joint venture between British Eagle and Cunard Line. The venture had ordered two Boeing 707 aircraft in March 1961, intending to recapture Cunard's transatlantic market which was traditionally the preserve of their ocean liners, the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. They received permission to operate services between London and New York in June 1961, though this was swiftly withdrawn by the Minister of Aviation when BOAC appealed the decision. Smallpeice additionally served as managing director of the BOAC-Cunard joint venture Smallpeice, concerned about the additional competition and unable to obtain additional Boeing 707 aircraft any other way, began talks in April 1962 to merge BOAC's North Atlantic operations with those of Cunard Eagle. Agreement was reached in early June 1962 on ownership percentages, and the newly formed company, BOAC-Cunard, began operations later that month. The new airline would operate all the transatlantic services of BOAC and Cunard Eagle from 1962 to 1966. Smallpeice served as managing director of the joint venture, in addition to his role as managing director of BOAC itself. The downturn in the aviation sector and ongoing disagreements between Julian Amery, the new Minister of Aviation and BOAC concerning writing off debt incurred buying and troubleshooting new British aircraft resulted in a further deterioration in relations between the airline and government. Amery commissioned an independent report into the financial performance of BOAC, undertaken by John Corbett. The ongoing disagreement about the funding arrangements for BOAC and the need for new Vickers VC10 aircraft would eventually be resolved in late 1963, when Slattery formally retired as chairman, though this was widely seen as a resignation; Slattery commented in 1964 that he had effectively been sacked. Giles Guthrie, a respected aviator, merchant banker and director of British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements of the company and Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report. Smallpeice and Slattery were praised by Guthrie in 1964, when the airline reported a profit for the 1963‚Äì1964 financial year, commenting that he was unable to take credit for the performance and this his predecessors were largely responsible for the improved financial performance of the airline. Cunard The RMS Queen Mary, which was making a loss in 1965, when Smallpeice took over as chairman. He would sell the vessel in 1967 and the RMS Queen Elizabeth in 1968 Smallpeice, upon leaving BOAC, spoke with his friend Kim Cobbold, the Lord Chamberlain about future career possibilities. He was advised to take a holiday and put his departure from BOAC behind him, whilst Cobbold would investigate what positions may be available for Smallpeice. Cunard Line, already familiar with Smallpeice as a result of the BOAC-Cunard venture, were quick to approach him. Sir John Brocklebank offered Smallpeice a board position with the shipping line in December 1963, during Smallpeice's last meeting as a BOAC representative on the BOAC-Cunard board. Smallpeice initially refused to commit to the position, instead taking a three-month cruise from Hong Kong to London (with P&O;). Smallpeice arrived back in London during March 1964 and returned to meet with Cobbold, informing him of the offer with Cunard, a position which initially would be the management of Cunard's London operation, with a trip to Cunard's headquarters in Liverpool once a week for management and board meetings. Cobbold also had a job offer for Smallpeice, an accountancy position within the Queen's Household, a position formally to be titled Administrative Adviser. This position could be combined with the work at Cunard quite comfortably, but would preclude taking further directorships in the short term, as a result, Smallpeice was forced to turn down non-executive director positions with Charterhouse Group and Rugby Portland Cement. Smallpeice joined Cunard and was appointed to the board in April 1964. Bill Donald, the deputy chairman of Cunard, retired in June 1965 and Smallpeice was appointed as his replacement, but this was to be a short term position. John Brocklebank stood down on 8 November 1965 on health grounds, and Smallpeice was promoted to chairman and chief executive by his colleagues on the board. Cunard was in significant financial difficulties when Smallpeice joined, and posted a loss of $7.2 million in 1965, losing money on the passenger ships and making profits on their shipping line. Smallpeice initially attempted to resolve the financial position of the company by embarking on a merger with another shipping line. Ocean Steamship Company had previously asked that they have first refusal on a merger with Cunard. Ocean Steamship brought P&O; into the discussions, and a three-way merger at one point looked feasible, but neither party could see any benefit in a deal involving Cunard, and backed out of proposed deal. The National Union of Seamen's Strike of 1966 damaged the already fragile finances of Cunard, and left Smallpeice with few options. The company, by now in need of cash, was forced to sell its stake in BOAC-Cunard. Smallpeice then turned to strengthening the board and bringing in experts from outwith the company, inviting Stormont Mancroft, 2nd Baron Mancroft, Priscilla Buchan, John Wall and Maxwell Joseph to join the board. Q4 under construction by John Brown & Company, Clydebank in August 1967. Basil Smallpeice was involved in the fitting out of the ship Smallpeice, once the new Cunard board had been constituted, turned his attention to the new cruise ship being built for the company. The ship, codenamed Q4, had been proposed and planned under the auspices of his predecessor, John Brocklebank. However, with the ship now approaching completion and requiring fitting out, it would fall to Smallpeice and his board to appoint interior and exterior designers and approve design schemes for the new ship. Smallpeice, having assessed a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, decided on significant alterations to the interior layout, abolishing the old three class layout and replacing it with a flexible layout which could be split into two classes for North Atlantic crossings and combined into a single class layout for cruising in the Caribbean. This new layout was expected to suit the tastes of American passengers, predicted to be the largest passenger group on the new liner. The existing cruise ships RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth were intended to remain in service until their replacement entered service, but a deterioration in the passenger market in 1967 resulted in the sale of the RMS Queen Mary, being sold to raise additional funds for the company at the end of the 1967 summer cruising season. The RMS Queen Elizabeth followed out of service in November 1968. The naming of Q4 required discussion between Smallpeice and Michael Adeane, the Queen's Private Secretary, both before and after the naming The naming of Q4 presented a headache for Smallpeice, realising that he could not seek permission to call the ship the Queen Elizabeth II, as only Royal Navy battleships had been named after a reigning monarch. Smallpeice discussed the issue with the Queen's Private Secretary Sir Michael Adeane and it was agreed that they would recommend to Her Majesty that the ship be named Queen Elizabeth. This was in keeping with normal Cunard practice of reusing previous ships names and didn't present any issues as the old and the new ships would not be in Cunard service at the same time. Elizabeth II launched the ship on 20 September 1967 but surprised and delighted Smallpeice and the invited guests when she named the ship Queen Elizabeth the Second. Smallpeice believed using the style Queen Elizabeth II wasn't entirely appropriate, it being the designation of the sovereign, and sought permission to use an Arabic 2 in place of Roman numerals. The shipping line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already familiar with the containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself with the use of containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British shipping lines, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it would be necessary to form partnerships. Smallpeice initially held discussions in 1965 with the newly formed Overseas Containers group, which was focused on the UK to Australia and Far East routes, about Cunard's Port Line subsidiary and Ronald Vestey's Blue Star Line joining British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P&O; and the Ocean Steamship Company in the joint venture. Their approaches were rebuffed, and it was quickly decided that Cunard and Blue Star Line should try to form a rival group, which would be called Associated Container Transportation. The venture was formed in late 1965 and early 1966, with the first board meeting taking place on 12 January 1966. Cunard's Port Line and Vestey's Blue Star Line were joined by Ben Line, Ellerman Lines and Harrison Line in the venture. Alexander Hull from Ellerman Lines was the inaugural chairman, but following his death in April 1967, Smallpeice took over as chairman of Associated Container Transportation. The Australian shipping interests of Cunard, Blue Star Line and Ellerman Lines were subsequently formed into a separate operating company (Associated Container Transportation (Australia)) and following work by Smallpeice, the Australian government allowed the state owned Australian National Line to form a partnership with Associated Container Transportation (Australia). The group would go on to form the Pacific America Container Express which operated services between Australia and the east coast of North America via the Panama Canal. Smallpeice would serve as chairman of the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian National Line partnership from its creation in 1969 and as chairman of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) from 1971, retiring from both positions in February 1979. The process was repeated for Cunard's North Atlantic shipping interests. They applied and were accepted into the Atlantic Container Line in December 1966, joining with the founding companies Wallenius Lines, Swedish American Line, Swedish Transatlantic Line and Holland America Line. Cunard joined at the same time as Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique (French Line). Cunard inherited planning work and ship designs when they joined with Atlantic Container Line group, and as part of their application to join, Cunard would build two ships for the ACL fleet, the SS Atlantic Causeway and the SS Atlantic Conveyor. The SS Atlantic Conveyor would, in 1982, become the first British merchant ship to be lost to enemy action since World War II, after being requisitioned for use in the Falklands War. The agreements to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, a reversal of the situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of ¬£2 million in 1968 and ¬£3 million in 1969 and the share price rose accordingly. The downturn in the economy and shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target. Smallpeice attempted to defend the company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company. This course of action would ultimately prove futile and Trafalgar House would launch a successful bid for the company, beginning on 30 June 1971. Smallpeice accepted an increased bid from Trafalgar House at the end of July, and would go on to preside over the last board meeting of Cunard as an independent company on 25 August 1971, 93 years after its incorporation. Lonrho Duncan Sandys, chairman of Lonrho during the period Smallpeice served as non-executive deputy chairman Smallpeice transferred to the Trafalgar House board, but stayed just five months before leaving in January 1972. Trafalgar House together with Blue Star Line and Ellerman Line asked that Smallpeice remain in his role as chairman of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) and the Australian government asked that he remain in his role as chairman of the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian Line partnership. Sir John Thomson, chairman of Barclays Bank approached Smallpeice in March 1972 about him joining the board of Lonrho, which was in need of refinancing. The financial markets expected additional experienced company directors to be appointed to the board, resulting initially in Conservative politician and former cabinet minister Duncan Sandys taking over as chairman of the company. Smallpeice, when at BOAC, had worked with Sandys when he was aviation minister and the two knew each other well. Sandys sought Smallpeice to join him on the board of Lonrho. Alan Ball the previous chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice were joined by a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan at a cost of ¬£80 to ¬£100 million, whilst the company was in the midst of refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling ¬£44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received. The situation would deteriorate further, additional legal and financial irregularities were uncovered, leaving Smallpeice and the other directors to consider resignation. Smallpeice was informed, after consulting Nicholas Wilson, a partner with Slaughter and May that he and the other directors could leave themselves liable to legal action for dereliction of duty. Counsel advised Smallpeice and the other directors that they should submit Lonrho to inspection by the Department of Trade and Industry, but in discussions with the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Leslie O'Brien, this course of action was recommended against. Smallpeice and seven of his fellow directors felt there was no other course of action left open to them but to ask Rowland to relinquish all executive appointments with Lonrho, but to allow him to remain on the board as a non-executive director. Rowland refused and the eight directors prepared to pass a motion at the first full board meeting, set for 18 April 1973, forcing Rowland to relinquish all of his executive appointments. Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an interlocutory injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal. Rowland then proceeded to take the eight directors to court, to permanently prevent them from being able to vote on his removal from the board, this case was lost by Rowland, but due to delays in the legal process, the final judgement was passed on 14 May, 17 days prior to the general meeting, and it was felt best to leave the composition of the board to a vote of shareholders. Rowland's 20% holding in Lonrho and further proxy votes would allow him to retain his position on the board and at the general meeting, Smallpeice and the seven fellow directors were voted off the board. The behaviour of Lonrho was described by the Prime Minister Edward Heath as \\"the unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism\\" in a House of Commons debate on 15 May 1973, and the company was eventually subject to an enquiry by Inspectors from the Department for Trade and Industry, which reported in 1976. Smallpeice and the seven other directors were dubbed \\"the straight eight\\" as a result of their honest and principled stance in contemporary newspaper coverage, but Smallpeice would find further employment impossible whilst the Lonrho investigation was carried out. The resulting investigation showed evidence of illicit payments being made to Duncan Sandys and Angus Ogilvy, bribery of African leaders and of Lonrho avoiding UN sanctions by trading with the white minority regime in Rhodesia, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 216. Other interests Smallpeice served as a director of Martins Bank from 1965 to 1969 alongside Sir John Brocklebank, his predecessor as Cunard chairman, remaining with Martins until 1969 when the bank was incorporated into Barclays Bank. He served on the London local board of Martins Bank prior to his appointment on the main board, serving from to 1964 to 1965. Smallpeice would join the London local board of Barclays Bank after their takeover of Martins Bank, a position he held until 1973. He was involved throughout his career in professional bodies, in addition to his time on the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales earlier in his career, from 1958 to 1961, he served on the council of the Institute of Transport. Smallpeice then served on the council of the British Institute of Management from 1959 to 1964 and again from 1965 to 1975, during this period, he was also a member of the Government's Committee for Exports to the United States of America, serving from 1964 to 1966. He was promoted to chairman of the British Institute of Management, serving from 1970 to 1972, and then as Vice President from 1972 onwards. His final industrial council appointment was as President of the Institute of Freight Forwarders from 1977 to 1978. Smallpeice joined John Corbett at accountancy firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. in 1975, working as an air and sea transportation consultant. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. would merge with Klynveld Main Goerdeler to form KPMG in 1987. His role with BOAC would see him be appointed a liveryman of The Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in 1960 and joining the Air League. He succeeded Clive Hunting as chairman of the Air League in 1971 for a three-year term. He was a companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1960 to 1975, and became a liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers in 1961, as a livery company, they represent aircraft builders. Smallpeice remained on the boards of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) and the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian Line partnership until retiring in 1979. His final professional position would be his role as Administrative Adviser to the Queen's Household, from which he retired in 1980. Personal life St. George's Church, Esher. Smallpeice was President of the Friends of St. George's Church Smallpeice married twice, firstly, he married Kathleen (Kay) Singleton in 1931. Kay was a school friend of Smallpeice's sister who was some four years younger than Basil. He also had a younger brother, who was five years younger. Kay was diagnosed with an illness of the blood in December 1968 and following a second bout of illness, passed away on 2 February 1973, following 41 years of marriage. He married for a second time on 2 November 1973 to Rita Burns, who had been his secretary at Cunard, and they remained married until Basil's death on 12 July 1992. Smallpeice was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1961 for services to the sovereign, this was for his work in organising flights for the Queen and other members of the Royal family whilst with BOAC. Smallpeice was also honoured by various other countries, and was made a member of the National Order of the Cedar by Lebanon in 1955. The United States honoured Smallpeice by giving him the Key to the City of San Francisco in 1959. He was also honoured with a Pioneers Award for his contributions to the development of container shipping by the Containerization Institute in New York during 1981. His interests outside of industry resulted in him serving as chairman of The English Speaking Union of the Commonwealth from 1965 to 1968, succeeding Lord Baillieu. He served his local communities as chairman of the Leatherhead New Theatre (Thorndike) Trust from 1966 to 1974 and after moving to Cobham, was President of the Friends of Cobham cottage hospital from 1987 and President of the Friends of St. George's Church, Esher, also from 1987. He was a member of the London clubs Athenaeum and Boodle's, and of the Melbourne Club in Melbourne, Australia, and enjoyed golfing and gardening as recreation activities. Her Majesty The Queen was represented at Smallpeice's funeral by Lieutenant-Commander Sir Russell Wood, an Extra Gentleman Usher in the Royal Household.

This was a thoroughgoing change, since the CPC had been accustomed (and still is to some degree) the \\"rule of man\\" rather than the \\"rule of law\\" (law in the sense of party by-laws). The main problem under Mao could be argued was democratic centralism and how it was interpreted. Democratic centralism was defined as \\"centralism on the basis of democracy and democracy under centralized guidance\\". In an environment in which formal definitions, institutional design and procedures were relegated to lesser importance, and those of subjective responsibility and personal ethics were emphasized, men dominated institutions. Ting Gong argues that democratic centralism under Mao \\"was used to justify the extraordinary authority of its leading officials over ordinary members without subjecting the former to any institutionalized supervision.\\" These problems, the strength of individual politicians and the weaknesses of internal party institutions, may have led to the Cultural Revolution and what the CPC considers as excessive leftism of the 1960s and 1970s. The modern idea of inner-party supervision came with the reestablishment of the CCDI in 1978. Deng was in the forefront already in 1980 to institutionalise the discipline inspection system;\\"it is most important to get supervision and inspection institutionalized within the Party\\". Despite this, the work on this never took off during Deng's own tenure. While several party documents were published on the issue, such as the \\"Provisional Stipulations of Enhancing the Intra-Party Discipline Inspection by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission\\" in 1987, \\"Opinion on Establishing a System of Democratic Assessment of Party Members by the Organizational Department of the CCP\\" in 1988 and \\"Several Stipulations on the System of Democratic Life Meetings for the Leading Party Officials at or above the County Level by the CCP Central Committee\\" in 1990, actual publication of regulation were few and far between. Efforts on institutionalizing the system blew of steam early on, and did not regain steam until the 1990s. This is partly to blame on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Seeing how the party public image was in decline due to its poor anti- corruption efforts the CPC responded by attacking \\"official speculation\\", the dominant form of corruption at the time. The 6th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee (held in 1990) established a taskforce on drafting what would become the \\"Internal Supervision Regulation\\". The first draft was published in 1991, but work on it was abandoned. The idea resurfaced in \\"The CPC Central Committee's Decision on Several Important Issues Concerning the Party's Construction\\" in 1994, and a taskforce responsible for drafting the document was established. The new taskforce was empowered full investigative and consultative powers, and worked until 2000 when the second draft was issued. Work stopped yet again from 2000 until the 16th National Congress (held in 2002). The 16th Central Committee established a third taskforce, which published three drafts in April 2003. A period of consultation ensued, in which the taskforce sent the draft to leading cadres, provincial committees and lower-level committees. Several revisions were made, and in December 2003 the 16th Politburo, on behalf of the 16th Central Committee, approved the draft and issued it under the name \\"Internal Supervision Regulation\\". It was promulgated in 2004.

Biography  Serebrovsky was born in Ufa to the wealthy family of an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya, the organization responsible for the successful assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. In 1903 Serebrovsky became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party member. Serebrovsky continued the family political activity; his first arrest was in 1902. Serebrovsky studied at St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, but emigrated in 1908 to Brussels. In 1911 Serebrovsky graduated from the Higher Technical School in Brussels and received a degree in mechanical engineering. Upon returning to Russia, he worked in various engineering and technical positions. During the Russian Civil War, Serebrovsky had been a government director of two of the biggest plants in Petrograd. After the October Revolution, Leon Trotsky induced Serebrovsky to join in the Soviet work. The Soviet service brought him, as it did so many others, into the Communist party, where he became \\"one of the mainstays of the regime\\". In May 1920, the Council of People's Commissars (CPC) sent 35-year-old Serebrovsky to the Absheron peninsula to head Azneft, the newly created conglomerate of nationalized Azerbaijani oil enterprises.  Soviet Oil Production Reform  Serebrovsky's first arrival in the United States was on July 29, 1924; the next day, he visited the central office of the Standard Oil Company of New York, negotiating with Walter Teagle. In order to establish credit for the Soviet oil organization, Serebrovsky had to meet with the then 90-year-old John D. Rockefeller himself and described the meeting in his memoirs: ‚Äú[Rockefeller] was very well-informed about things in Baku... and about our resources... I proposed two arrangements. First, he would give a letter of guarantee to his bank to pay our supplier invoices from future earnings on petroleum products.... Rockefeller thought for a long time, and then looked at me attentively and unexpectedly agreed. Second, he would give a letter to suppliers in which he would recommend us as buyers well known to him and recommend that we be given the same discount on invoices as Standard Oil. Rockefeller accepted this much more readily. It was around five in the afternoon, and tea was served. The old man poured tea for me, offered me cookies with jam, and then invited me to take a stroll. He walked quickly and for a long time, half an hour, and we went around the entire forest park. I was hardly able to keep up with him, and my leg ached.‚Äù During the return sea voyage from the US to Europe, Serebrovsky finished his book The Oil and Gas Industry in America [–ù–µ—Ñ—Ç—è–Ω–∞—è –∏ –≥–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞], which summarized his stay in the US. During his brief stay in London, he had the book published in Russian. Serebrovsky was dubbed the \\"Soviet Rockefeller\\" for his work on the Caucasian oil fields, and introduction of American drilling tools and techniques. Serebrovsky also contributed to the formation of the gas-oil production department of the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy.http://asoa.edu.az/?page_id=5412‚ü®=en and has an offsite oil field named after him.http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/339917/view  Soviet Gold Production Reform  Having successfully completed his assignment to return the Caucasian oil fields to production, Serebrovsky was charged by Joseph Stalin with the task of reforming the Soviet gold industry. Stalin had read several books about the 1849 California Gold Rush, including works by Bret Harte and Blaise Cendrars' book Sutter's Gold, later turned into an American film. Serebrovsky immediately travelled to Alaska posing as a simple \\"Professor of Mines\\" (he was in fact a professor at the Moscow Mining Institute as well as a key functionary of the regime); his plan was to duplicate American mining techniques in the USSR. At one of the first Alaskan mines he visited, Serebrovsky met Jack Littlepage, then age 33, who was a successful mining engineer. Littlepage initially dismissed Serebrovsky's offer of work in the USSR stating that he \\"did not like Bolsheviks\\" as they \\"seem to have the habit of shooting people, especially engineers.\\" However Serebrovsky persevered and persuaded Littlepage to emigrate to the USSR with his family for nearly 10 years before returning to the USA. Later, in 1936, Serebrovsky's Russian-language book On the Gold Front [–ù–∞ –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–º —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ - rus] was published; however his book was \\"withdrawn from circulation very shortly after it appeared because some of the men mentioned in it were later discovered to be conspirators.\\".  Death  Serebrovsky was arrested on September 23, 1937, and on February 8, 1938, was convicted of ‚Äúcounter revolutionary activities‚Äù by the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court. He was shot on February 10, 1938, at age 53. According to Stalin's own report, Serebrovsky was a \\"vicious enemy of the people\\" who had delivered no less than 50m gold bars to Leon Trotsky.

His paintings are a mix of all those styles and movements. Early life and education Lord was born and raised in the bay- side suburb of Mornington, Victoria, Australia. Lord has no formal fine art qualification; he is a self-taught artist and his inspiration and main influences to pursue a career in visual arts have been Germany's Bauhaus theory, John Brack, James Rosenquist, an American artist who was one of the protagonists in the pop-art movement Robert Rauschenberg and Barbara Kruger. Career In Lord's early career in the 1990s he found his inspiration and ideas by looking closely at the world around him. From his youth he was inspired by the street culture of Melbourne, coupled with the influence of pop art and magic realism. Many of his themes were very dark in meaning. His Smiley Face series in the style of pop art and surrealism was about fake people, whom on the one hand greet with a smile, then you begin to see the decaying skin around the smile, by the use of images of war and violence. The primary medium used was oil on canvas. Lord left Australia at the beginning of 2000 as he felt that he had exhausted all of his art ideas at that point in time and that an obvious change was required. He traveled to Berlin, Scotland, Michigan, and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Abroad he worked alongside artists that influenced his change of outlook and approach and thus a new style in his work began to emerge. More recently he has explored the theme of future history, a term often used by science fiction writers. Lord's interpretation of Future History is to mean that the creation of something gives it a history of its own. When he returned to Melbourne he decided to move from using oil on canvas, to acrylic paint on wood. Exhibitions and more In 2008 his work was part of the Thrill & Suspense exhibition at Wall's Gallery, Amsterdam, Netherlands, where he exhibited alongside artists from the USA and the Netherlands. Of 19 artists that exhibited Lord, along with two others rated a mention. Wall's Gallery wrote, \\"With 'Thrill & Suspense' Walls Gallery presents its new exhibition of works by 19 young and talented artists. Hereby I like to give special attention to Stephen Elledge (USA), Rolina Nell (NL) and Josh Lord (AUS). These three artists have made their mark abroad and are now shown for the first time in Amsterdam, and that in Walls Gallery.\\" In 2009 the Leader Community Newspapers interviewed Lord in an article titled \\"Art Show Brings Back Yesterday to Yarraville\\" by Florencia Cavallo. The article talks about his return to Australia and his new exhibition titled When it was Yesterday, at Fad Gallery, Melbourne. Mooks Report online editorial also featured a write up about the same exhibition and an interview with Lord. Mooks asked \\"What's been the single biggest highlight for you as an artist?\\" To which Lord responded ‚ÄúCommissioned by MacDonalds house Hong Kong and International house New York, I think it was doing the work, not where it hangs, and the idea that these people asked me to do it was awesome.‚Äù In 2010 his work was featured in an exhibition titled Upgrade/Downgrade, at Open Concept Gallery, Michigan, USA. This was a multimedia exhibition demonstrating the experimentation and opposing relationship of nature versus or combined with technology. It included artists from all around the world. Many shows followed such as Paradise Hills First Birthday in 2011 and Melbourne's Burning: Paradise Hills 2012, which Lord curated. Another in 2011 was Lord's solo exhibition at Melbourne's Gasworks Arts Park, called Do Electric Sheep Follow the Digital Herd. Melbourne radio station SYN 90.7 interviewed Lord about this show. A photo of Lord's painting We're New, We're Retro, painted in 2005 was published in The Design Files magazine, in the Australian Homes section 2 February 2011 edition. The article was about the showroom/home of David and Lolly of Codename Tom. Scroll down to see the photos of details from the hallway with the caption \\"Details from the hallway, including We're New, We're Retro painting by Josh Lord, Australia c. 2005.\\" Lord's solo exhibition in 2014, This Used to Be the Future, was held at D11@Docklands art gallery in Melbourne. Using mainly acrylic house paint on board, his paintings focused on the theme of Future History, with the term referring to the science fiction subgenre future history. The exhibition featured 50 of Lord's works. On the opening night of This Used to Be the Future exhibition a live show was staged that featured Australian musicians Ollie Olsen and Ash Wednesday, who created electronic sounds with a visual arts backdrop. Lord's exhibitions often include a collaboration between artist and musicians, showcasing a mutual respect for Australian art and music. Amongst the array of subject matter of Lord's paintings were portraits of Melbourne musicians, including both Ollie and Ash. The exhibition ran for a period of two weeks and was an example of Lord's latest acquired style. In October 2015 Hugo Race & The True Spirit released the official video of their new track \\"False Idols\\" on Glitterhouse Records. The video was directed by Matthew T. Ellery and features images of 11 paintings by Lord (one image taken from a photo by Linsey Gosper). Lord talked to TAGG Magazine/Toorak Times in 2016 about his past exhibitions and influences, the present and future plans in an interview titled \\"Interview with Josh Lord\\" by Lisa Romeo.

Early life and education Greig was born in Stratford, New Zealand in 1936. He studied at Wellington Technical College and went on to Auckland University to study architecture. There he met fellow architecture student Rhondda Greig, whom he married in 1962. Career An encounter with the work of potter Len Castle encouraged Greig to take up pottery, and he attended Castle's evening classes for three years before moving to the Northland Region in 1961 to set up a pottery studio. He developed a strong relationship with Len Castle and was influenced by his work. Between 1964 and 1967, he became the resident potter in charge of the art and design centre at Massey University in Palmerston North. In 1968 he moved to Greytown in the Wairarapa and set up his own studio. In 1978, a QEII Arts Council grant allowed Greig to travel to Japan where he studied the techniques of Japanese potters and developed strong connections with the pottery community, becoming particularly influenced by potter Kawai Kanjir≈ç. Greig also travelled to Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Mexico and the USA during this trip. In 1982, Greig was awarded a Japan Foundation Fellowship to spend a year living, working and studying in Japan. During this year, he was invited to exhibit in the highly regarded Tachibana Ten exhibition. He also exhibited work at Akasaka Green Gallery in Tokyo in 1983 and 1985. Greig was made a Cultural Ambassador by the New Zealand Government in 1986. In 1986 he exhibited over 200 pieces of his work in the Tachikichi Department store in Kyoto.

It was held that the power of freedom of contract must be interpreted in a way that protects people's genuine (rather than formal) autonomy, in those situations where there is a structural inequality of bargaining power. Facts The case concerned a series of claimants, including spouses and children, of a party which had mortgaged the family home, in order to secure a loan from a bank.

It began on August 2, 1891 on Buzludzha peak on the initiative of Dimitar Blagoev. Around 20 members of the Socialist party from Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Dryanovo, Sliven, Kazanlak, Stara Zagora and other cities took part in the Congress. The Congress marked the end of the beginning phase of the Socialist movement in Bulgaria, and the beginning of organized party activity for the uniting of Socialism with the worker's movement. The Bulgarian Socialdemocratic Party took Marxism as its ideology. Preparation The conference was held, from May 3 to May 5 in 1891, in Veliko Tarnovo under the leadership of Dimitar Blagoev. Attendance The members in the meeting were: * Dimitar Blagoev, * Nikola Hr. Gabrovski, * and Dragomir Gerganov, from Veliko Tarnovo. * Mihail Ivanov, * Mihail Boichinov, * Mihail Radev, * and Panayot Venkov, from Dryanovo. * Unknown member, from Gabrovo. * Sava Mutafov, from Sevlievo. * Konstantin Bozveliev, from Kazanlak. The main question in the meeting would be if they were to be shown to the public as a socialdemocratic party, and what their character would be. With no exceptions but the members from Sevlievo and Kazanlak, they decided to create a party, and that it did not have to be a worker's movement. Furthermore, they decided to lay the groundwork for the party on July 20, 1891, in the same Congress. Meetings The meeting was conducted in secrecy, because Stefan Stambolov's government strongly controlled freedom of association in Bulgaria. Buzludzha and the time of the meeting were chosen due to the fact that at the same place and time, massive celebrations of the anniversary of the death of Hadzhi Dimitar were being held. Because of this, the small group remained unknown and held its meeting. The Congress decided on an agenda and other matters for the Bulgarian Socialdemocratic party. The agenda, which was written like the French and Belgian workers' parties, contained the basis of Marxism. It stated that Bulgaria had (temporarily) gone down the path of Capitalism and that the Bulgarian socialists must collaborate and merge into a single party to await the oncoming Socialist \\"coup\\" and to organize and enlighten them. The members of the BSDP also approved the decentralized structure of the party and the autonomy of the smaller associations within it. A General Soviet for the party to guide it was headquartered in Tarnovo. It decided that it was necessary to produce a weekly digest of the party and a series of brochures, which comprised the \\"Bulgarian Socialdemocratic Library\\" (Bulgarian: –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞, Balgarska socialdemokraticheska biblioteka), whose first piece of literature was Dimitar Blagoev's book What is Socialism and is it Starting in Us?.

It survives in fragmentary form in two manuscripts, both dating from ca. 1200 making them some of the earliest Icelandic manuscripts, and the earliest illustrated manuscripts from Iceland. The fragments are significantly different from each other and either represent copies from two separate exemplars or different reworkings of the same text. Both texts also contain material that is not found in standard versions of the Physiologus.  Summary  The Icelandic Physiologus exists in two versions: Fragment A (AM 673 a I 4to) consisting of five entries, and Fragment B (AM 673 a II 4to) with eighteen. There contents are as follows: Fragment A: I. The Phoenix II. The Hoopoe III. The Siren IV. The Horsefly V. The Onocentaur Fragment B: I. The Hydra II. The Goat III. The Wild Ass IV. The Monkey V. The Heron VI. The Coot VII. The Panther VIII. The Whale IX. The Partridge X. The Onocentaur XI. The Weasel XII. The Asp XIII. The Turtle Dove XIV. The Deer XV. The Salamander XVI. The Kite XVII. The Boar XVIII. The Night Heron XIX. The Elephant Physiologus A features a moral interpretation of these five animals, with illustrations of the first four. Physiologus B is a more typical version of the Physiologus, whereby the animals are described and given an allegorical meaning. Del Zotto Tozzoli, the manuscript's most recent editor, has suggested that these texts are closer to Bestiaries than the Physiologus. Latin versions of the Physiologus often contained a myriad of entries that ranged from exotic quadrupeds to mythical beasts to birds, trees and stones. Entries in the Icelandic fragments are visibly more scarce in diversity, focusing most heavily on birds and common forest-dwelling animals, with the notable inclusions of the whale, the Siren, two instances of the Onocentaur, and the monkey. This scarcity could be present for a number of reasons, which range from the lack of Latin scholarship in Iceland that would likely have stifled translation efforts of the Physiologus‚Äô more difficult passages, to the persistent issue regarding Iceland‚Äôs geography, whose tundra climate and high Northern location signify the physical absence of a great number of beasts that were present in other manifestations. Problems regarding geography may have prompted translators to leave out certain entries that were of the most confusion, since they may not have even heard of certain beasts, let alone seen them in person. The most conspicuous absence in this case is of the lion, which appears as the first entry in a great number of European bestiaries of the time. Described in its profile as a Christ figure due to the heroic nature often assigned to it throughout ancient and medieval mythology, the first spot in the Icelandic manuscript is instead replaced by the phoenix, whose behaviors and moralization are of a similar nature. In regards to a reason why this change may be present, one could look at the fact that the majority of entries in the two fragments are of birds, a type of animal that Icelanders would often have seen. Despite the phoenix actually being a mythical beast, the lion was ‚Äî in a sense ‚Äî more mythical, given that the image of birds was more present than large, predatory quadrupeds in Iceland. The whale stands out in the Icelandic Physiologus as the only animal to have two moralized behaviors, and an illustration that presents a close resemblance. Along with the appearances of the different birds that are documented in the two fragments, an argument could be made that the translators had made a conscious choice to include animals that Icelanders would have recognized, aside from the more fantastic beasts that appear. Encounters with whales are documented often in Icelandic literature; there were even laws in the country as far back as the mid-10th Century revolving around their function as crucial resources. The whale‚Äôs profile in the bestiary, however, mentions none of its importance to the lives of Icelanders, instead paralleling its description to other manuscripts of the time. Iceland‚Äôs Physiologus also holds some of the same inconsistencies as other manuscripts of the time: the Hydra is often confused between being a bird or some kind of snake, and the odd behavior of the weasel that is often confused in translation ‚Äî described in Old Norse that it conceives in its mouth and gives birth through its ear ‚Äî is contrastingly reversed according to different legends. As it was with many of the beasts whose descriptions were distorted through broken translation, it seems to stay true that reaching a point in which the author could create a moralization for the entry held the most importance.  Manuscripts and preservation  Physiologus A survives in the manuscript AM 673 a I 4to, a single bifolium measuring 170‚Äì183 mm x 138 mm. It is covered in small holes, which may be explained by √Årni Magn√∫sson's note that \\"I received this leaf in 1705 from Magn√∫s Arason; he took it from a sieve that was used to sift flour in D√Ωrafj√∂r√∞ur.\\" Physiologus B is preserved in the first fiveleaves of the manuscript AM 673 a II 4to and was collected by √Årni Magn√∫sson along with the Teiknib√≥k in around 1700. This manuscript also contains two allegorical homilies on the ship and the rainbow. Two leaves (6v and 7r) were added later and contain a Latin fragment and a medical text from around 1370 in East Norwegian. AM 673 a II 4to and AM 673 b 4to (which contains Pl√°citus dr√°pa, the earliest preserved dr√°pa) are written in the same hand with the same layout and must have originally belonged to the same manuscript.

According to eyewitness reports, armed men dressed in civilian clothing broke into his house and forced him into a vehicle. The kidnappers also took S√°nchez's computer, camera, and cellphones. S√°nchez was the founder and director of the weekly newspaper La Uni√≥n, (\\"The Union\\"), where he covered a variety of topics, including political corruption, government mismanagement, and organized crime. He was also active on social media as a reporter, and in his community as a taxi driver, small business owner, and neighborhood organizer. His family initially suspected that the mayor of Medell√≠n de Bravo, Omar Cruz Reyes, was responsible for masterminding the kidnapping because S√°nchez was a harsh critic of his administration. The mayor, however, pledged his innocence and stated that S√°nchez and him maintained a close friendship. On January 24, his corpse was discovered inside a plastic bag in Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz. Post-mortem examinations confirmed that his kidnappers cut his throat open and severed his head while he was still alive before mutilating his body into several pieces. Investigators believe that municipal policemen, acting on orders of the mayor, participated in the murder. S√°nchez was the first journalist kidnapped and killed in Mexico in 2015. Background S√°nchez began his career in journalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was a house newspaper distributor for Notiver, one of the most-read newspapers in Veracruz. S√°nchez became interested in journalism by socializing with reporters early in the morning before his daily distribution. S√°nchez did not have a college degree nor any background in journalism. Years later he began participating in several civil society projects in Medell√≠n de Bravo and founded the neighborhood Guti√©rrez Rosas, where he lived. In 2005, S√°nchez founded La Uni√≥n (\\"The Union\\"), a weekly newspaper based in Medell√≠n de Bravo. Originally, the outlet had a print version that catered to readers in the municipality of Medell√≠n de Bravo, including those in the regions of Puente Moreno, Paso del Toro, El Tejar, and Medell√≠n, the county seat. He and other citizens interested in informing their community distributed the newspaper themselves. However, lack of funds forced S√°nchez to switch from his free print edition to an online-only edition. Under his management, La Uni√≥n covered a variety of topics, though it was characterized for its critical and direct reporting style. S√°nchez was known for publishing articles about organized crime violence stemming from drug trafficking, local political corruption, traffic accidents, community concerns, and government mismanagement. He was also active on his personal Facebook page, where he made posted about public works left incomplete by the local government, like street potholes and water leaks. S√°nchez also worked as a photographer and reporter for media outlets in the Veracruz‚ÄìBoca del R√≠o metropolitan area. He did not receive money for his work as a media worker, however. S√°nchez provided for his family by being a taxi driver and owning a small grocery store. He was a taxi driver for two reasons: S√°nchez wanted to earn enough money to make a living for his family. But he was also wanted that job because it allowed him to talk with people from his hometown on a daily basis. This provided a venue for him to collect information about citizens' pleas for his publications. His colleagues described S√°nchez as a dedicated news gatherer, despite the fact that he was self-taught and had no professional training in journalism. Because Medell√≠n de Bravo is semi-rural and located outside of the Veracruz metropolitan area, many media outlets do not report what occurs in the region. Official journalists relied on his information to report what occurred in Medell√≠n de Bravo. According to his son, S√°nchez was kidnapped for his journalism, given that he reported on violence in Medell√≠n de Bravo and had received death threats. He believed this because the kidnappers did not take any money or valuable belongings from the house, and went specifically for S√°nchez and his belongings related to his profession as a reporter. Weeks prior to his kidnapping, S√°nchez had written about the public security problems in Medell√≠n de Bravo. On December 13, 2014, he published a report on social media that a vegetable merchant from El Tejar had been assaulted and killed. This incident happened in his neighborhood. That night, the neighbors organized and armed themselves with sticks, machetes, and other sharp objects. They carried out night patrols to prevent any repeat of that incident, and planned to protest against the local government for the lack of public safety. S√°nchez also reported on a shootout that left a father and son injured. S√°nchez and his neighbors criticized National Action Party (PAN) politician Omar Cruz Reyes, the mayor of Medell√≠n de Bravo, along with the local police, for their alleged apathy. S√°nchez also commented on Cruz Reyes's supposed special unit of the Mexican Navy that protected him. S√°nchez got together with his neighbors on December 17 and formed the self-defense group Comit√© de Autodefensas de la Colonia Guti√©rrez Rosas as a reaction to the security problems in the municipality. S√°nchez was a neighborhood committee leader responsible for organizing people. On December 27, a day after Cruz Reyes's annual press conference, S√°nchez reported on his Facebook page of the discovery of two human corpses in Medell√≠n de Bravo. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. More than 100 media workers have been kidnapped and/or killed since 2000, and most of the crimes against the press remain unsolved and with few perpetrators arrested. The state of Veracruz, in addition, is the most dangerous state in Mexico for journalists. At least fifteen journalists have been killed and four more remain disappeared since 2000 (at least ten of them were killed between 2010 and 2014). Many of the journalists killed in Veracruz wrote about organized crime and corruption. The most recent incident in Veracruz prior to S√°nchez's abduction was the kidnapping and murder of Gregorio Jim√©nez de la Cruz in February 2014. S√°nchez was the first journalist kidnapped and killed in Mexico in 2015. On January 4, 2015, two days after his abduction, former Televisa reporter Jazm√≠n Mart√≠nez S√°nchez was killed in the State of Nayarit. A day later, another media worker was killed. Jes√∫s Tapia Rodr√≠guez, anchorman of Parras TV, was stabbed to death inside his home in Coahuila. Kidnapping At around 7:30 p.m. (CST) on January 2, 2015, three vehicles arrived at the home of Jos√© Mois√©s S√°nchez Cerezo, located in the Guti√©rrez Rosas neighborhood of Medell√≠n de Bravo, Veracruz, Mexico. According to his neighbors, at least nine armed men wearing ski-masks descended from the vehicles and stormed the house asking for him. S√°nchez was sleeping in his bedroom upstairs, while his wife was watching television with her grandchildren. They broke several doors inside the house and trashed some rooms before taking S√°nchez's computer, camera, and cellphones. The gunmen then forced him into one of the vehicles. While this was happening, he asked his abductors to not hurt his family. The kidnappers then fled the scene to an unknown location. His son Jorge S√°nchez Ord√≥nez claimed that the neighbors contacted the local police soon after the abduction took place, but that their calls were not answered. They then called the federal military agency, the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA), which deployed agents throughout Medell√≠n de Bravo. S√°nchez's family claims that law enforcement authorities took several hours to arrive at the crime scene. Before midnight, S√°nchez's family members went to offices of the Attorney General of Veracruz to formally issue a complaint for his disappearance. State authorities then carried out an investigative operation overnight in an attempt to locate him. Reactions and protests The press freedom organization Article 19 condemned the attack and asked for the office of the Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR), Mexico's Attorney General Office, to take over the case. They also asked the Mexican government to provide protection for S√°nchez's family and to guarantee the journalist's own life and safety. The New York-based press freedom group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also condemned the attack and asked for authorities to increase their efforts to locate S√°nchez and arrest the kidnappers. CPJ researchers said in the report that Veracruz state authorities have, in past incidents, tried to dismiss the connection between journalists' profession and their murders. \\"Veracruz authorities have a history of denigrating the activities of local journalists and a miserable record of impunity in cases of crimes against journalists,\\" said Carlos Laur√≠a, CPJ's representative for Latin America. The Inter American Press Association also expressed its concern over S√°nchez's disappearance. It stated that it was concerned that attacks against the press in Mexico would continue in 2015. PEN International published a report asking for Mexican authorities to investigate S√°nchez's kidnapping case along with Mario Alberto Crespo Ay√≥n's, a TV reporter and former print journalist who was reported missing in Sinaloa in December 2014. Protests were also carried out a few days after the abduction, in both the state of Veracruz and as well as nationwide, by journalists and others who demanded to know S√°nchez's whereabouts. In Chilpancingo, Guerrero, journalists and photographers protested on Mexican Federal Highway 95 (also known as the \\"Autopista del Sol\\"). They started at 11 a.m. on January 4, 2015 and stayed there for about an hour. Some of the protesters held placards, while others handed out several fliers to drivers returning from Acapulco with information about S√°nchez's kidnapping and about the risks of being a journalist in Mexico. After handing out all their fliers, the protesters left the highway. Protests were also carried out in three Guerrero cities, Acapulco, Chilpancingo, and Zihuatanejo. In Acapulco, reporters, media correspondents, and photographers from several media outlets met at La Diana roundabout. The protesters demanded S√°nchez's safe return and criticized the government of Veracruz for failing to protect journalists. They also sent a message to Guerrero authorities for its own shortcomings in responding to local attacks on the press. In Tecoanapa, reporters from Chilpancingo, Acapulco, Tlapa, and the Costa Chica region gathered in protest as well. On January 5, outside Medell√≠n de Bravo City Hall a group of journalists gathered to demand authorities for S√°nchez's safe return. In a sign of protest, the attendees placed their cameras and placards on floor of city hall. One of S√°nchez's brothers challenged Cruz Reyes to walk out of city hall and speak to the protesters. Journalists also asked for the removal of the mayor's political immunity in order to facilitate the investigations pending against him. In Xalapa, the state capital, protesters met outside the government building of Javier Duarte de Ochoa, the Governor of Veracruz, demanding S√°nchez's return. \\"Duarte, bring him back before [President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto] arrives\\", read one of the posters held by a journalist, in reference to the President's scheduled trip to Veracruz that week. The protesters also criticized Duarte for the violence and impunity that prevails among Veracruz's media. After a protester read a communiqu√© directed at President Pe√±a Nieto, Secretary of Interior Miguel √Ångel Osorio Chong, and Attorney General Jes√∫s Murillo Karam, among others, the protest made its way to the historic downtown area. There they protested for the safe return of three other Veracruz journalists that remain disappeared: Evaristo Ortega Z√°rate (2010), Manuel Gabriel Fonseca Hern√°ndez (2011), and Sergio Landa Rosales (2012). On their placards, the journalists paid homage to murdered Veracruz journalists: Regina Mart√≠nez P√©rez (2011), V√≠ctor Manuel B√°ez Chino (2012), and Gregorio Jim√©nez de la Cruz (2014). That same day, similar protests were carried out in other cities in the State of Veracruz: Veracruz, Boca del R√≠o, Acayucan, and Coatzacoalcos. In Coatzacoalcos, where journalist Jim√©nez de la Cruz was killed in 2014, more than 20 journalists protested at city hall demanding S√°nchez's safe return. In Acayucan, several journalists marched in the downtown area with the same demands. They read a document signed by over 100 journalists from Veracruz in which they asked for the intervention by the federal government and international organizations in locating S√°nchez. On January 6, journalists in Puebla, Puebla protested and asked authorities to return S√°nchez alive. In Puebla's main square, the journalists gathered with placards criticizing Veracruz authorities for their alleged negligence and apathy. They read a manifesto asking for the PGR to intervene and transfer the case to the Special Prosecutor for Crimes against Freedom of Expression (Fiscal Especializada de Atenci√≥n a Delitos contra la Libertad de Expresi√≥n [Feadle]), an organ within the PGR that specializes in attacks against the press. With placards, they spoke out against the murders of Veracruz journalists, which have increased since 2000. The next day, other protesters gathered outside a Veracruz state government office in Mexico City. They asked authorities to seek justice for S√°nchez and other victims of violence in Mexico. S√°nchez's family also protested outside the World Trade Center in Boca del R√≠o, Veracruz prior to a ceremony conducted by President Pe√±a Nieto. S√°nchez's brother Juan Carlos S√°nchez Cerezo protested and asked for President Pe√±a Nieto to bring the case under federal jurisdiction, because he alleges state officials were not searching for his brother. On January 8, reporters from several media outlets protested outside Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara, Jalisco. They carried placards asking for S√°nchez's return, and had a list of the more than one hundred journalists disappeared and/or killed in Mexico. Investigation and aftermath On January 3, 2015, Governor Duarte told reporters at a press conference that all lines of investigation were being considered in the case. However, reporters stated that Duarte had simply referred to S√°nchez as a \\"taxi driver and neighborhood activist\\" instead of mentioning his profession as a media worker. \\"Our priority is to be able to locate him to return him to his family,\\" Duarte said. When questioned about the mayor's involvement, Duarte said that it was being considered. Investigators alleged that S√°nchez's reports at La Uni√≥n and in his Facebook page reportedly angered Cruz Reyes. This line of investigation holds that three days before his kidnapping, S√°nchez learned through a trusted source that the mayor had plans to silence him to \\"teach him a lesson\\". The family suspects that Cruz Reyes masterminded the kidnapping because he was angry at S√°nchez for his critical remarks against the local government. In an interview that day, the mayor, however, denied his involvement in S√°nchez's kidnapping, said he was worried and saddened about the incident, and agreed to cooperate in the investigation. He said that he had not met with S√°nchez's family members in order to not obstruct the investigation. Cruz Reyes said that his collaborators have been working closely with the family, however. The Mayor also said that he had a clear conscience and that S√°nchez was a close friend of his. \\"[S√°nchez] was with our team during our political campaign ... we were very close to him,\\" Cruz Reyes stated. People close to S√°nchez claimed that the mayor and S√°nchez were friends until December 2012, and that they were often seen together at political campaigns when Cruz Reyes was running for office. However, when Cruz Reyes did not appoint S√°nchez as head of the Director of Social Communication in Medell√≠n de Bravo, a post he wanted, problems began to surface. Instead of entrusting S√°nchez to that position, they said, the mayor appointed a female reporter from Veracruz, and this ended up creating animosity between the two. After this incident, S√°nchez began to take critical stances against Cruz Reyes in his reports. Veracruz Attorney General Luis √Ångel Bravo Contreras, who is working personally on the case, met with S√°nchez's family at their home on January 4 and assured them that authorities were searching for him. Though he said that the agency working on the case could not provide more details of the investigation, Bravo promised to get back to them as the investigation advanced. He clarified that the case was not given any special priority because S√°nchez was a reporter. \\"The important thing about this case is that he is a human and a native of Veracruz who has disappeared,\\" Bravo said. Bravo told the family that the investigation was going well and that authorities were working on several leads. However, he highlighted the importance of keeping the details and evidences of the investigation secret in order to not jeopardize S√°nchez's safety and to be able to bring him back safely to his family. On January 5, Veracruz state authorities detained the municipal police force of Medell√≠n de Bravo. In a communiqu√©, they informed that the 48-hour legal detention of the police officers was done to investigate the possible involvement of the agents in S√°nchez's forced disappearance. The entire police force, composed of thirty-six members, were called in for questioning. On January 7, a state judge ordered an extension of the legal detention of 13 policemen to thirty days. Bravo confirmed that the extension was made in order to continue investigating them. The policemen were kept together because authorities believe that they were responsible by omission or for actively participating in S√°nchez's kidnapping. \\"There is evidence that the policemen did not do what they were supposed to do. Had they done their task, they could have prevented [S√°nchez] from being seized from his home\\", Bravo said. In addition, he added at a press conference that DNA, dental, and anthropometric investigations were made on the cadavers found in the central region of Veracruz to see if they matched S√°nchez's profile. Bravo said that one of the corpses, located on January 5 in the municipality of Soledad de Doblado, was possibly S√°nchez's, but that it was physically unrecognizable because it bore signs of torture. When it was discovered, the body had been decomposing for 36 to 48 hours. Bravo said authorities would not discard or confirm S√°nchez's status until the investigations issued results. The forensic specialists who worked on identifying the bodies also worked on the bodies found in the case of the mass disappearance of 43 students in Guerrero in late 2014. On January 10, however, S√°nchez's son confirmed that none of the corpses found corresponded to his father's. On January 12, Cruz Reyes went to the Attorney General's Office of Veracruz in Xalapa for questioning and to issue his declaration on the case. He went with the PAN's State President Jos√© de Jes√∫s Mancha Alarc√≥n, congressman Domingo Bahena Corbal√°, and his lawyer, Sergio Rodolfo Vaca-Betancourt Archer. The mayor's attendance was invitational and voluntary, however, because he had political impunity under the Constitution of Mexico. Bravo clarified that the PGR and the federal government can strip the mayor from political immunity without any restrictions. Municipal officials claimed that the mayor was seen sporadically at work for least three days because he had attended several meetings related to the case. In the declaration, Cruz Reyes stated that he was not involved in organized crime and that he had nothing to do with S√°nchez's disappearance. He said that he had no differences with him, citing that the relationship between them was good and cordial. In addition, Cruz Reyes lamented that the case was politicized. That next day at a press conference, the mayor stated that authorities were using him as a scapegoat. He asked authorities to be impartial and consider other lines of investigations too, like his publications on social media that reported about self-defense groups in Medell√≠n de Bravo. Confirmation of death On January 24, 2015, the corpse of S√°nchez was found by Mexican authorities inside a plastic bag in Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz. S√°nchez's throat was cut open by his kidnappers and was decapitated while still being alive. Then his body was mutilated into pieces, placed inside a plastic bag, and abandoned at the location it was found. Authorities had arrested Clemente No√© Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠nez, a former municipal police officer and alleged drug trafficker, along with five other people the day before. They confessed to have participated in the kidnapping and murder of S√°nchez, and directed authorities to the victim's location. The corpse was identified after investigators hydrated the fingers and matched the prints with the ones they had on file. The corpse was unrecognizable, but his son stated that the visible characteristics did not match his father's. He expressed doubts that the corpse belonged to S√°nchez and asked authorities to provide DNA results. During the police interrogation, Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠nez stated that the deputy police chief of Medell√≠n de Bravo, Mart√≠n L√≥pez Meneses, who was also the mayor's chauffeur and personal bodyguard, ordered the abduction and murder of S√°nchez. The attack, he said, was masterminded by the mayor Cruz Reyes. He also made reference to other policemen who participated in the murder, but name most of them by their aliases: \\"El Harry\\", \\"El Chelo\\", \\"El Moy\\", \\"El Piol√≠n\\", and Jos√© Luis Olmos (alias \\"El Olmos\\"). Veracruz Attorney General Bravo confirmed at a press conference the following day that the kidnappers took S√°nchez with the sole intention of killing him for reporting about violence in Medell√≠n de Bravo. By killing him, the murderers were granted protection by L√≥pez Meneses to operate in their drug dealing ring. The ring's activities had been interrupted a month before when S√°nchez asked federal authorities to patrol the areas where they operated. Investigators concluded that he was killed the same day he was kidnapped. On January 27, state authorities conducted DNA analyses and confirmed that the body was S√°nchez's. His son stated that he wanted federal authorities to carry out analyses too because his family did not trust Veracruz authorities. On January 20, S√°nchez's three brothers, Juan Carlos, Arturo, and El√≠as, told the media that after taking a look at the corpse with state authorities, they did believe it was his brother's. They said they were convinced after state authorities analyzed S√°nchez's teeth, hands, feet, ears, and used a dental plaque to confirm his identity. The PGR confirmed through DNA analysis that the body corresponded to S√°nchez on February 5. The results were issued to his family and to Article 19. The next day, authorities transported the body to Medell√≠n de Bravo to hand it over to the family. That evening S√°nchez's family held a wake at their home with their friends, neighbors, and members of the neighborhood's self-defense group. They built an altar for \\"Moy\\" (short for \\"Mois√©s\\"), as S√°nchez was affectionately known by those close to him, lit candles, cooked tamales for those present, and led group prayers. In a short speech, his son thanked those present for attending and supporting S√°nchez throughout the case. Legal proceedings against alleged perpetrators A few days after S√°nchez's body was located, state authorities stated that they wanted to strip the mayor of Medell√≠n de Bravo, Cruz Reyes, from his constitutional political immunity in order to be legally processed like a regular citizen. The alleged killers of S√°nchez accused him of masterminding the attack. The legal procedures against the mayor, however, would take up to a minimum of 25 days and require at least 34 votes in Veracruz's Congress, a supermajority. Once Cruz Reyes is officially notified of the charges against him, he will have to make an appearance in court and present his defense. The plaintiff will have up to ten days to review the defendant's side before ruling a decision and sending it to the State Congress. In a press conference on January 26, 2015, Cruz Reyes stated that Congress's insistence to strip him from his political immunity was not rooted in political or partisan interests. On Facebook, several people bashed Cruz Reyes on his page and called him a murderer. The mayor responded by saying that he did not kill S√°nchez and did not mastermind the attack. On January 29, one of the confessed killers, Clemente No√© Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠nez, was formally charged by a Veracruz state court for murder. Given that it he was charged for murder, Rodr√≠guez was held without bond. Two Medell√≠n de Bravo police officers, Jos√© Francisco Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez and Luigui Heriberto Bonilla Zavaleta, along with L√≥pez Meneses, transferred by state authorities to Veracruz for a hearing. All three of them denied their participation in the kidnapping and murder of S√°nchez, but they decided not issue a legal declaration or answer any questions and exercise their right to remain silent as expressed in Article 20 of the Constitution of Mexico. According to a document read by the court secretary, Cruz Reyes and L√≥pez Meneses were at a nightclub known as La Berrinchuda the day S√°nchez was killed. The mayor was with his family and friends enjoying a concert by the banda group Calibre 50, while L√≥pez Meneses and other policemen were outside guarding the premises. While at the concert, he mayor and the police were notified by the press secretary of the municipal government that S√°nchez had been forcibly taken from his home, and that the journalist's family required police protection at their home. Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez and Bonilla Zavaleta were at Tulipanes street in Guti√©rrez Rosas neighborhood (where S√°nchez lived) the moment the kidnapping occurred. They reportedly did not notice anything unusual and were eating hotdogs when the abduction took place. In fact, one of them sent a text message to her wife that he would pay one in advance for her. After that, both of them left to El Tejar and then to a park. As they patrolled the area, they were notified through radio that someone had been kidnapped in Guti√©rrez Rosas and made their way back to the neighborhood. They interviewed a women who said was angry because she had called local authorities and no one had arrived, and that she had to call the Navy. Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez and Bonilla Zavaleta said they had seen S√°nchez in person before and knew who he was, but that they had nothing to do with his abduction and murder. Both of them were charged with homicide and failure to fulfill a legal duty. Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez said that the government was using them as scapegoats. L√≥pez Meneses, on the other hand, said he knew that S√°nchez was a reporter who criticized the mayor and wrote about violence in Medell√≠n de Bravo, but he also said he was innocent. He also told authorities that was not a deputy police chief in Medell√≠n de Bravo. He said that a man known as Dar√≠o Vela was the one in charge of that position. On February 3, L√≥pez Menses, Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez, and Bonilla Zavaleta, were officially charged by a Veracruz state court after authorities concluded that there were enough evidences to inculpate them. Because they were charged with homicide and failure to fulfill a legal duty, crimes considered grave under Mexican law, there were held without bond and imprisoned. On February 11, Cruz Reyes asked for a 59-day leave of absence to the municipal government. The mayor asked for the absentia in order to \\"attend his legal issues and not disrupt his municipal duties\\". The petition was granted and Betsab√© Sol√≠s Neri, a municipal administrator, became the interim mayor. Case against Omar Cruz Reyes With 35 votes in favor and 13 against, the Congress of Veracruz stripped the political immunity of Omar Cruz Reyes, the mayor of Medell√≠n de Bravo, on March 26, 2015. With this legal action, authorities were legally able to investigate him and issue an arrest warrant. The congressmen concluded that there were enough evidences to prosecute Cruz Reyes, but he was still considered innocent until proven guilty. Cruz Reyes's defense, however, stated that they had plans to request a writ of amparo (effectively equivalent to an injunction) for congress's decision in the next fifteen days. They stated that there were several inconsistencies before giving the verdict. His lawyer stated that Cruz Reyes was in hiding somewhere in the state, but not in Medell√≠n de Bravo. In accordance to law, Cruz Reyes can only return to office if he is found not guilty of the charges against him. Luis Gerardo P√©rez P√©rez, the mayor pro tempore, was expected to take his seat once Cruz Reyes's 59-day leave of absentia concluded. On March 29, P√©rez P√©rez accepted the municipal duties and will start his post on April 11. Several people in Medell√≠n de Bravo, however, protested against P√©rez P√©rez taking power. They claimed that when Cruz Reyes asked for a leave of absence, he did not take his place immediately. The protesters claimed that P√©rez P√©rez decided to re-accept the position for personal interests. Betsab√© Sol√≠s Neri, who took Cruz Reyes's place during the absentia, was the municipal authority that the protesters requested to take power.

They are produced by human eosinophils (a class of white blood cells), mast cells, the L1236 Reed‚ÄìSternberg cell line derived from Hodgkin's lymphoma, and certain other tissues. These cells produce the eoxins by initially metabolizing arachidonic acid, an omega-6 (œâ-6) fatty acid, via any enzyme possessing 15-lipoxygenase activity. The product of this initial metabolic step, 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, is then converted to a series of eoxins by the same enzymes that metabolize the 5-lipoxygenase product of arachidonic acid metabolism, i.e. 5-Hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid to a series of leukotrienes. That is, the eoxins are 14,15-disubstituted analogs of the 5,6-disubstituted leukotrienes. A closely related set of 15-lipoxygenase metabolites are derived from anandamide (i.e. arachidonic acid containing ethanolamine esterified to its carboxy residue). These eoxin-like metabolites, termed eoxamides, are also formed by L1235 Reed-Sternberg cells and proposed to play a role in Hodgkins disease. Eoxins have been suggested to contribute to inflammation in airway allergies and the development and/or progression of certain types of cancer, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma (a cancer originating from white blood cells), prostate cancer, and colon carcinoma. History and name The eoxins are 14,15-analogs of LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. Because the leukotrienes and 14,15-leukotrienes have very similar names, the 14,15-leukotrienes were renamed \\"eoxins\\" to avoid the confusion that might arise from referring to both group as \\"leukotrienes\\". The eoxins derive their name from eosinophils, the cell type where they were originally discovered in abundance. Types As indicated in the following Biochemstry section, there are 4 types of chemically distinct eoxins that are made serially from the 15-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid viz., 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 15(S)-HpETE): * Eoxin A4 * Eoxin C4 * Eoxin D4 * Eoxin E4 Biochemistry A 15-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX15 or ALOX15B) metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15(S)-HpETE (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid); 15(S)-HpETE is then converted to its 14,15-trans-epoxide, 14,15-trans-epoxide oxido-5Z,8Z,10E,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e., Eoxin A4 (also termed EXA4) by one of the 15-lipoxygenases. 15-(S)-HpETE is then metabolized to 14(R)-glutothionyl-15(S)hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. Eoxin C4 or EXC4) by conjugation to glutathione through the action of leukotriene C4 synthase. EXC4 contains glutathione (i.e. Œ≥-L-glutamyl-L- cysteinylglycine) bound in the R configuration to carbon 14. EXC4 is further metabolized by removal of the Œ≥-L-glutamyl residue to form EXD4 which is in turn further metabolized by removal of the glycine residue to form EXE4. These metabolic transformations are similar to and therefore thought to be mediated by the same enzymes that metabolize the 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoci acid of arachidonic acid (i.e. 5(S)-HpETE) to the peptide-leukotriens, LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The eoxin-forming pathway sequence is as follows: #Arachidonic acid ‚Üí 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HPETE)) via 15-LOX-1 or possibly 15-LOX-2, i.e. ALOX15 and ALOX15B, respectively #15(S)-HPETE ‚Üí EXA4 via 15-LOX-1 #EXA4 ‚Üí EXC4 via LTC4 synthase aka \\"glutathione S-transferase II\\" #EXC4 ‚Üí EXD4 via unidentified gamma- glutamyltransferase class enzyme #EXD4 ‚Üí EXE4 via unidentified dipeptidase class enzyme The Arachidonic acid + O2 ‚Üí 15(S)-HpETE ‚Üí EXA4 ‚Üí EXC4 ‚Üí EXD4 ‚Üí EXE4) metabolic pathway is analogous to the leukotriene-forming pathway (i.e. Arachidonic acid + O2 ‚Üí 5(S)-HpETE ‚Üí LTA4 ‚Üí LTC4 ‚Üí LTD4 ‚Üí LTE4). EXA4, similar to LXA4, is viewed as an intracellular intermediate that is rapidly converted to down-stream products while EXC4, EXD4, and EXE4, similar to LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are regarded as extracellular agents which stimulate cell function.  Sources  Cells and tissues rich in 15-LOX-1 activity such as human eosinophils, umbilical cord-derived mast cells, nasal polyps from allergic subjects, airway epitheleal cells, and L1236 Reed-Sternberg cells derived from Hodgkin's Disease tumors produce eoxins. EC4 is also made by a mixture of polymorphonuclear neutrophis and eosinophils isolated from the blood of allergen-treated mini pigs and ECA4 is made by mouse eosinophils; lacking 15-LOX-1, it is assumed that these cells employ 12/15-lipoxygenase to initiate this synthesis. Indeed, mice made deficient of 12/15-lipooxygenase exhibit an attenuated allergic airway inflammation response compared to wild type control mice. Function The eoxins were first defined in 2008 and have not yet been determined to have any roles in human physiology or pathology. However, their production is stimulated in human eosinophils by physiological agonists such as prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4, and interleukin 5. Furthermore, Eoxins stimulate vascular permeability in an ex vivo human vascular endothelial model system, and in a small study of 32 volunteers EXC4 production by eosinophils isolated from severe and aspirin-intolerant asthmatics was greater than that from healthy volunteers and mild asthmatic patients. These findings have led to suggestions that eoxins have pro-inflammatory actions and are involved in severe asthma, aspirin-induced asthma attacks, and perhaps other allergic reactions. A subsequent study found that eoxin levels in the exhaled breath of aspirin-sensitive and aspirin-intolerant asthmatic individuals did not rise after aspirin challenge and did not correlate with disease severity. The production of eoxins by Reed-Sternburg cells has also led to suggestion that they are involve in the lymphoma of Hodgkins disease and, possibly, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and other cancer types.  Eoxamides  The same pathways that metabolize arachidonic acid to eoxines have been shown to metabolize anandamide, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (i.e. arachidonic acid containing ethanolamine esterified to its carboxy residue) into a set of eoxamides that are identical to their eoxin counterparts except that they possess an ethanolamine ester. These metabolites have been named EXA4 ethanol amide, EXC4 ethanol amide, EXD4 ethanol amide, and EXE4 ethanol amide. These products were formed by the L1236 Reed Sternberg cell line presented with anandamide; human platelets presented with eoxamideA4 produced EXC4 ethanol amide, EXD4 ethanol amide, and EXE4 ethanol amide. The activity and function of these ethanol amide metabolites has not been reported.

It was built from 1868 to 1921. It is also known as Baroona Opportunity School, Petrie Terrace Opportunity School, and Petrie Terrace School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Baroona Special School comprises a number of buildings, including two brick buildings, one of which was opened in March 1868 as the Petrie Terrace School, whilst the second building was erected in 1874 as the new Petrie Terrace Girls and Infants School. Petrie Terrace developed as a working class suburb of Brisbane during the 1860s. Brisbane Gaol was built on the main road into town in 1860, and military barracks were erected in 1864. This site on which the school is located was reserved for educational purposes in the early 1860s. The Education Act of 1860 established a Board of General Education and provided for a system of government-subsidised primary school, similar to the system then operating in New South Wales. Under the Queensland Act, communities were required to contribute one-third of the cost of construction of new school buildings. Pupils at schools were also subject to payment of fees. At its commencement in 1860, the Board acquired four schools; 73 schools had been opened by 1868, and by 1874, 203 schools were open. State primary school By the mid 1860s a school was needed in the rapidly growing Petrie Terrace area, and efforts commenced to raise the necessary funds. The long rectangular classroom with end porches and teachers room was erected in 1867 at a cost of around . The classroom was designed to accommodate 150 pupils, with separate \\"departments\\" for male and female students. Just over 300 students were enrolled at Petrie Terrace School by the end of 1868, although the average attendance for that year was 157 pupils. The building was designed by architect Richard George Suter, who was working in Brisbane by 1865 when he was employed by Benjamin Backhouse. In 1864 Backhouse had prepared a model plan for the Queensland Board of Education, to be used for country schools. Whilst employed in Backhouse's office Suter prepared designs for school buildings, which later lead to the Board commissioning Suter for the design of timber schools and teacher's residences. From the end of 1868 until 1875, Suter undertook almost all of the Board's work which involved approximately 30 National Schools including schools in centres such as Toowoomba, Warwick, Gympie, Rockhampton, Townsville, Roma and Bundaberg as well as the Brisbane area. An inspection of the school in November 1873 reported that the school was crowded, and that as the district continued to increase in population at least double the classroom accommodation would be required. It is also likely that the introduction in 1870 of free education in Queensland stimulated the growth of the school. The report further noted that it was really a very fine school. Drawings for a new building were prepared by Suter by January 1874. The tender price for the new building was , and included separate rooms for the female students and the \\"infants\\". Although officially opened in January 1875, the new building was occupied from late 1874, and known as the Petrie Terrace Girls and Infants School. Suter designed the new building to be somewhat in character with the present school. A feature of Suter's work was his utilisation of the materials, as used in construction, to provide ornamentation of the building, whilst working within the strict budget set by the Board. The 1867 and 1875 buildings demonstrated Suter's characteristic use of the Gothic Revival Style and showed a progression in the design of window openings and the use of corbel ornamentation of the walls and gables in an attempt to surmount the innate vulgarity of bricks and hardwood. The headmaster of the Petrie Terrace School (Boys and Girls/Infants) from 1868 to 1898 was John Bowden Fewings, a gentleman and scholar. In 1892 Fewings wrote a collection of letters, (published in 1990 as JB Fewings Memoirs of Toowong) which provide a useful source of information on the development of Toowong and its inhabitants. Petrie Terrace School became well known for its many scholarship successes with many students becoming prominent Brisbane identities. By 1884 it was recommended that a new school be erected for the boys, who still occupied the 1867 school building. Various sites were considered, and land was reserved on Moreton Street, some streets to the north of the then Petrie Terrace School. Tenders for a new State School for Boys at Petrie Terrace were called in July 1888, and the Boys' School had relocated to the new site by May 1889. The Petrie Terrace Girls and Infants School remained on the original site; the 1867 building was used as the Infants' Department. Improvements to the school grounds were carried out from the early 1880s. These included tree plantings in the playground and the erection of play sheds (no longer extant). Records indicate that the shade trees planted included bamboos, Moreton Bay Figs, silky oaks, camphor laurels, small leafed figs and a jacaranda. The buildings were altered in 1914, at which time verandahs were added to the eastern side of the 1867 building and the northern side of the 1874 building. New gable windows and sunshades were added to the exterior of both buildings, greatly improving the ventilation and lighting of the classrooms. Both buildings were remodelled, including the removal of interior galleries and the entry porch from the northern side of the 1867 building, and the reorganisation of the teaching areas in the 1874 building with glass partitions. A new room for teachers was also added to the 1874 building. Also at this time a retaining wall was constructed east of the 1874 building, and a Drill Ground was formed. The 1914 plans also indicate that there were two play sheds west of the 1867 building. In 1921 a classroom was added to the northwest of the 1867 building. A new classroom was also added to the north side of the 1874 building at this time. The site was sewered in 1929, at which time the existing earth closets were removed and a new lavatory block erected. In July 1953, the Petrie Terrace Boys and Girls Schools were amalgamated. The Girls School relocated to the Moreton Street buildings, and a separate Infants School was formed at the Hale Street school. The Infants School was amalgamated with the Petrie Terrace School on Moreton Street from July 1960. Opportunity school Following the removal of the infants school to Moreton Street, the Hale Street school became the Petrie Terrace Opportunity School (for children with disabilities). The conversion of the Infants School to the Opportunity School included the addition of a new classroom to the 1874 building and a further remodelling of classrooms in both buildings. A Manual Training room was built into the basement level of the 1874 building, whilst a former classroom in the same building was converted into a Home Science Room. Special training for handicapped pupils had commenced in Queensland in the late 1880s with centres for blind and deaf children. In 1923 WF Bevington, a District Inspector of Schools, prepared a plan for the provision of special classes for children with intellectual and emotional problems who were not making \\"normal\\" progress at school. The first \\"backward\\" classes, as they were initially described, commenced at the South Brisbane Boys' School. The classes proved successful, and during 1923 similar classes were formed at the Fortitude Valley (Boys), New Farm (Mixed), Petrie Terrace (Girls), Ipswich Central (Boys), Townsville Central (Boys), Rockhampton and Toowoomba South (Girls) Schools. By the end of 1923, just over 330 pupils were in attendance at these classes, supervised by 15 teachers. From the middle of 1926 the name \\"Opportunity Schools\\", rather than Backward Schools, was adopted for these centres. Additions and remodelling were carried out at the school in 1961, and in 1962 the school was renamed the Baroona Opportunity School. A new toilet block was erected in 1964. Further remodelling of the school commenced in the early 1970s, and in 1975 a new amenities block was erected in place of the 1964 block, and a covered play area and new administration block were constructed. A hall had also been constructed on the site by 1975. The school was renamed the Baroona Special School in 1974. It continued to provide special education until 16 June 1995 when the school was closed. Present use In 2004, the school became the Albert Park Flexible Learning Centre, providing Years 11 and 12 (final two years of secondary school) to students needing more flexible school arrangements. It caters to students between the ages of 14 and 25. The centre was first established in 1990 in Albert Park to provide education to homeless children and later occupied the Lady Bowen Building in Spring Hill before the move to its present location. The school now supports a wider range of students, including parents of young children.  Description  Located at the corner of Hale Street and Milton Road, the Baroona Special School comprises a complex of buildings. The earliest buildings on the site were erected in 1867 and 1874, and these buildings retain a prominent position in the south west corner of the site.  1867 Building  This single-storeyed brick building is T-shaped in plan, with steep gable roofs designed for shingles, and dormer windows either side of the main roof ridge. The walls are of English bond, and the largely unaltered southwest elevation has corbels and eaves brackets to support the dormer windows, and lancet windows with straight pointed heads set between the corbels. The building is set on Brisbane tuff foundations, with brick buttresses to the corners of the minor gable, the weathering stones of which have rubbed depressions from sharpening slate pencils. The main gable end walls assumed their present form in 1914, when the timber porch at each end was replaced by a large composite 24-sash window, and the lancet window to each side of the new central window and the double rectangular windows above were bricked up; the brick lozenge-shaped ventilation opening in the gable peak remaining unaltered. The timber verandah on the east side of the building was also built in 1914, and is contemporary with the two eastern doorways into the classrooms, and the removal of the original galleries from the building interior. There is a later glazed verandah infill on the northwest. Within the 1867 building, the space is divided into two classrooms by a concertina room divider, and has a raked plaster ceiling.  1874 Building  Constructed to the north of the 1867 classroom, this building comprised an L-shaped, single- storeyed structure with basement on tuff foundations with a steep pitched roof and dormer windows in the hips. This building is also in English bond, with lozenge vents in the gable peaks, but unlike the earlier building, has a running frieze of brick corbels below the eaves, raked brick window sills and square headed window openings. Brick buttresses are provided to the north and east gable corners where the ground falls away. Although the 1874 south and west timber verandahs and brick porch remain, the north verandah was added in 1914 at the same time as 24 pane composite windows were inserted into each of the three brick gables. Within the building, brick panels were removed and RSJ beams inserted to allow construction of the large glazed door partition to the northern verandah, and the opening into the southern porch area. The existing glazed partitions between classrooms were also constructed in 1914, contemporary with removal of the galleries and bricking-up of selected doors and windows. The roof truss is lined with timber boards above the rafters, and comprises a mid tie and a tie at the wall plate, with vertical steel connecting rods. The 1874 building has been extended to the north with a brick store building (before 1929), a timber infants' room built over a basement room (before 1959) and a new passage and classroom built in 1959 with a newly fitted out manual training room and laundry underneath. The 1959 extension has face brickwork foundations, and is sheeted in weatherboards with hopper windows replacing the earlier sliding sashes, and has a corrugated GI roof. French doors provide access to the early verandahs, which are of timber with hardwood floorboards, square section posts and no balustrading, and which are open except for ventilated storage space on the western edge.  Grounds  The 1914 drill ground remains as a grassed area to the east of the 1867 building. The reinforced concrete retaining wall along the northern site boundary dates from 1929, the same year that sewage was laid on and a new toilet block constructed beside the 1874 building. The 1929 toilet block was demolished in 1975, to make way for the existing covered play area and administration area. Toilet amenities and a tuckshop now occupy a 1975 steel framed building in the northeast corner of the site, next to the c.1950s fibro hall. The school grounds and the perimeter have several large mature trees that are likely to have been planted before 1929, and which provide a framework for the attractive carefully tended garden and building surrounds at the school.  Heritage listing  Baroona Special School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As the site of a primary school from the late 1860s, the Baroona Special School is associated with the development of education in Queensland from this time. The School has an important association with the development of Special Education in Queensland, as one of eight schools in which special education classes were held in the early-mid 1920s, and the subsequent conversion of the school to an Opportunity School during the 1960s. The erection of the first building in 1867 and a second building in 1874 also illustrate the development of Petrie Terrace as a residential area during this time. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The buildings erected in 1867 and in 1874 survive as early examples of brick school buildings designed by prominent architect RG Suter, who was responsible for the design of school buildings in Queensland during the late 1860s and early-mid 1870s, a period of expansion of school facilities in Queensland. Subsequent additions and alterations to the 1867 and 1874 buildings provide evidence of changing attitudes towards primary and special education. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The grounds of the school contain several mature trees and evidence of earlier use of the grounds, for example as a Drill area. The prominent location of the 1867 and 1874 buildings on the corner of Hale Street and Milton Road, and the mature trees located around the perimeter of the grounds, contribute to the Petrie Terrace townscape.

Early life Gardner was born on 29 July 1879 in Hobsonville, Auckland, to Louise (n√©e Clark) and John Gardner. As a child she was tutored at home before spending two years at Araparera School after it opened in 1893. Growing up, her family was involved in the pottery industry: her uncles owned the Amalgamated Brick and Pipe Company, while her brothers established a brickworks in 1902 at New Lynn - with guidance from Gardner, they later expanded into domesticware and became known as Crown Lynn. She moved to live with her brothers at New Lynn.  Career Gardner became increasingly interested in creative arts and began embroidery, tapestry and painting, spending some time in Australia studying these crafts and exhibiting her decorative needlework in Auckland in 1920. She began taking classes at Elam School of Fine Arts, studying sculpture under William Wright and learning about MƒÅori design from artist and illustrator Trevor Lloyd. Gardner became interested in pottery when English potter Willam Speer came to work at New Lynn on a newly installed pottery wheel. Although he was largely discouraging, she began to teach herself pottery, beginning at 5.30am and working for two hours until Speer came to work at 7.30 am. She experimented with different glazes and decorating materials, experiencing technical difficulties in her early works. During the 1930s, her skill and recognition developed. She began regularly exhibiting her pottery through the Auckland Society of Arts in 1930. In 1937 she exhibited with the Waikato Society of Arts alongside four other women artists. The following year, she established a kiln and pottery studio at her family home. During the war years, demand for her work increased, and her work was sold throughout New Zealand, but particularly at the Auckland departments stores Smith & Caughey's, and Milne & Choyce.

Recognitio monographica Ramalinarum. Bull. Soc. Linn. Normandie, Sr. 2, 4:101‚Äì181. is probably in reference to the dilated branch with a reticulated surface, similar to a tortoise shell. Distinguishing Features Niebla testudinaria is distinguished by a broad hemispherical thallus divided into many branches that spread widely above a narrow base where attached to a reddish orange pigmented holdfast, collectively appearing as a tangled mass to 7 cm high and 5 cm broad; the branches dividing frequently above base, more or less equal in length but often unequal in how they spread apart and in direction, often abruptly bent in changing direction of growth, especially the uppermost branches, often oblong to linear-prismaticOblong: branch length less than 10 times width. Linear: branch length 10 or more times width. Prismatic: shaped like a prism in cross section between branch intervals, frequently with dilated segments, asymmetrically elliptical in shape (bulging more on one side), occasional thalli with branches strongly flattened. The species (N. testudinaria) also recognized by the protruding reticulate vein-like ridges in the cortex as seen between branch margins, the cortex also appearing dull to slightly glossy along marginal ridges, relatively thick, 75‚Äì150 ¬µm thick. Pycnidia proment but often widely scattered. Apothecia developing near ends of branches, solitrary or in small aggregates. Divaricatic acid is the key lichen substances, with triterpenes. Similar species include Niebla homalea, Niebla eburnea, Niebla caespitosa, Niebla disrupta, and Niebla dissecta. The latter two (N. disrupta, N. dissecta) differ in having sekikaic acid. Niebla homalea is often difficult to distinguish from N. testudinaria. The key taxonomic character to recognizing N. homalea has been the obscure reticulate cortical ridges between the branch margins, in which the obscurity appears related to an extra glossy layer above the normal two-layered cortex, referred to as an ‚Äúepicortex‚Äù;Bowler, P.A. 1981. Cortical diversity in the Ramalinaceae. Can. J. Bot. 59: 437‚Äì453. however, the more frequent development of transverse cracks also distinguishes N. homalea. This may be related to a different developmental pattern in cortical hyphae. which is scarcely visible, except on Guadalupe Island where thalli have a glossy cortex with prominent transverse ridges less frequently cracked. Additional character features for distinguishing N. homalea are branches that are mostly erect and closely parallel (‚Äúfastigiate‚Äù), and are often more curved than abruptly bent near apex. These features may also relate to the frequent transverse ridges, in contrast to the shorter reticulate hyphal ridges seen in thalli of N. testudinaria. Niebla caespitosa has a similar reticulate cortex to N. testudinaria but differs in its thickness, (25-)45‚Äì75 ¬µm thick. The thinner cortex in this species (N. caespitosa) is undoubtedly related to its crinkled margins, to the more sharply delineated cortical ridges, and to the more recessed cortical surface between the ridges. Niebla eburnea differs in its pastry like smooth cortex, and in the branches twisted near base, in contrast to the frequent twisting of the longitudinal ridges as related to a change in the orientation of the branch margins in N. testudindaria Taxonomic History William Nylander described Niebla testudinaria as a species of Ramalina (R. testudinaria) occurring on rocks (saxicolous) and branches of shrubs and trees (corticolous lichen) in California among a small group of related species that included R. ceruchis reported to occur on rocks and shrubs (and cacti) in South America (=Vermilacinia ceruchis), R. comboeides (=Vermilacinia combeoides) on rocks in North America, R. homalea (= Niebla homalea) on rocks around San Francisco, and R. flaccescens (= Vermilacinia flaccescens) on shrubs in South America. In 1913, R. Heber Howe, Jr. defined Ramalina testudinaria (= Niebla testudinaria) more narrowly by the dilated branches and by the development of terminal aggregate apothecia.Howe, R.H., Jr. 1913. North American species of the genus Ramalina. The Bryologist 16: 65‚Äì74. He recognized an additional variety, var. intermedia, that had been described by Johannes Mueller Argoviensis (of Aargau) in 1882; both regarded as occurring only on rocks, in contrast to the shrub thalli that were considered to belong to R. ceruchis by the teretiform branches. Niebla homalea was distinguished by having lateral apothecia and a smooth cortical surface. Except for the taxonomic key and comments, his detailed descriptions of the species were largely extracted from Nylander's (1870) monograph. The occurrence of R. ceruchis (= Vermilacinia ceruchis)in North America had been earlier reported by Edward Tuckerman;Tuckerman, E. 1866. Lichens of California, Oregon and the Rocky Mountains; as far as yet known. J.S. & C. Adams, Amherst, MA however, Tuckerman had recognized the South American species‚Äîthat grew on rocks, sand, and shrubs‚Äîas belonging to a single species, R. ceruchis, whereas Nylander soon after distinguished an additional species, R. flaccescens, in South America. Howe subsequently suggested that R. flaccescens (= Vermilacinia flaccescens)also occurred in North America, based on a specimen collected by Edward Palmer in the vicinity of San Diego. In 1972, Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler, following a series of papers on the chemistry of the ‚ÄúCeruchis Group‚Äù,Bendz, G., J. Santesson & C. W. Wachtmeister. 1965. Studies on the chemistry of lichens. 20. The chemistry of the Ramalina ceruchis group. Acta Chem. Scand. 19:1185-1187.Follmann, G. 1966. Eine neue Ramalina-Art uas der Ceruches-Gruppe. Willdenowia 4(2): 225‚Äì233. reported that Niebla testudinaria (as Desmazieria testudinaria) was a synonym (of D. homalea), citing a paper they were publishing in a 1973 issue of The Bryologist‚Äî‚ÄúThe correct citations for Desmazieria homalea and D. ceruchis‚Äù (= Niebla homalea, = Vermilacinia ceruchis); however, the paper did not appear. Thus, Niebla testudinaria was still regarded a distinct species. Further, N. testudinaria was not mentioned in their 1978 summary of the species in the genus; however, it was indicated that they were preparing a forthcoming monograph on Niebla.Rundel, P. and P. Bowler. 1978. Niebla, a new generic name for the lichen genus Desmazieria (Ramalinaceae). Mycotaxon 6: 497‚Äì499. In 1994, Bowler, Rundel and their collaborators described additional species of Niebla, but again the status of N. testudinaria was not mentioned. In 1996, Richard Spjut distinguished Niebla testudinaria from N. homalea based on the differences in the cortex as described by Nylander‚Äîthe reticulate pattern of N. testudinaria vs. the smooth cortex of N. homalea‚Äîand also by the apothecia flattened to the branch as previously indicated by Howe. Of additional importance is the lichen substance of divaricatic acid. Upon determination of the secondary metabolite, divaricatic acid, Niebla testudinaria can be recognized by the crooked wide-spreading branches, which become shortly divided near apex, in contrast to N. homalea with fastigate branches that often have terminally divided branches of unequal length. Bowler and Janet Marsh in 2004 included Niebla testudinaria under a broad species concept of Niebla homalea, one that encompasses a wider spectrum of chemical and morphological variation found in Baja California; a concept that views N. homalea as one of only three species in the genus as defined by Spjut,Spjut R.

It was designed by Blair Wilson and built in 1972. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 January 2004.  History  La Boite Theatre was built in 1972 to the design of Brisbane architect Blair Wilson for the Brisbane Repertory Theatre Company. The Brisbane Repertory Theatre Society was founded in 1925 by a group of local theatre enthusiasts led by Barbara Sisley and Professor Jeremiah Joseph Stable. Their stated object was \\"to stimulate public interest and to promote public education in the drama and to promote and encourage the study and development of the best in dramatic literature and art.\\" Their first play was \\"The Dover Road\\" by A. A. Milne. and in 1926 they performed an Australian play and decided that they would in future include at least one Australian play in each year's programme. In 1931 they held their inaugural Australian Playwriting Competition, the winning play causing controversy when it was performed because of its realistic subject matter and coarse language. It was a sign of things to come. The theatre company became known for its production of modern and innovative theatre. They are now Australia's oldest continuously running theatre company. The group has performed in many theatres including Her Majesty's, the Bohemia, Cremorne, Theatre Royal, Rialto, Old and New Albert Halls and held a lease on the Princess Theatre for several years. However, one by one theatres closed and with the demolition of the Albert Hall in 1967, the last available and affordable venue for productions in the central city area was lost. The society looked for a way to continue productions and decided to establish a permanent home \\"where the theatre's image could flourish and members would be welcome at all times\\". The society had acquired two timber cottages on the corner of Hale and Sexton Streets, Petrie Terrace in the late 1950s for use as clubrooms. They then purchased adjoining properties and decided to convert one of the houses into a theatre-in-the-round. There were several reasons for this decision. To begin with, there was no existing theatre in the round in Brisbane, even though some experimental productions in this style had been well received. In 1965 an experimental in the round performance was held in the converted house in Sexton Street. Theatre in the round would extend the range of theatrical experience available to the Brisbane public and allow actors and directors to employ new techniques. There was an increasing overseas trend for more flexible performance space and a theatre in the round offered the simplest and cheapest way of achieving this. The equipment and scenery needed was not as elaborate as that required for a conventional theatre and seating capacity could be smaller so that an existing building could be utilised. The converted cottage seated 65 people and opened for performances in June 1967. In spite of the small space and limited technical facilities, a lack of proper seating and air conditioning, the new theatre was an artistic success. It was named La Boite (The Box) to acknowledge its box- like shape. Theatre-in-the-round, where the audience surrounds the players, is an ancient way of presenting performances but was new as a 20th-century theatrical form. It was an outcome of ideas developed in the first decades of the century in reaction to the restrictions of traditional theatre. At the time, theatres provided elaborate settings were the audience went to see and be seen and were seated on the ground floor and in rows of tiers and boxes facing a picture frame stage. Scenery and costumes were elaborate; acting was exaggerated in style and productions expensive to mount. Changes included simplification of settings and the use of lighting as an integral part of the performance, rather than just as means of illuminating the players. In a reaction to the proscenium stage, a movement began in the mid-20th century to design theatres with the performing area placed centrally in the auditorium. The placing of the audience around the performers rather than in front of them permitted a much closer relationship between actors and audience to develop. Margo Jones in Dallas, Texas, who studied this concept and used it for productions, wrote an influential book on her work, Theater-in-the-Round (1951). Notable examples of theatres associated with developing this concept are the Arena Stage in Washington, DC, USA (1961) and the Royal Exchange in Manchester, England (1976). The remaining cottages at Milton were used as studio, workshop and storage areas. Brisbane Repertory Theatre mounted more than forty productions over the next four years and their space needs became pressing. Brisbane City Council approval for a new theatre replacing the converted house was granted in 1971. It was also to be a theatre in the round, though this time designed and built for the purpose. Blair Wilson of Brisbane firm R Martin Wilson & Sons created the design with input from the theatre's Artistic Director, Jennifer Blocksidge. It was the first purpose built arena theatre in Australia, the Ensemble Theatre in Sydney using a converted space for its performances. The building construction was financed by a dollar-for- dollar grant of $40,000 from the Queensland Government in November 1971. The \\"dream theatre\\" designed by Blair Wilson was originally costed at $100,000, but it was found possible to reduce this to the available budget of $80,000 and retain the original design. This was done by modifying some details, reusing lighting and sound equipment from the old building and reducing costs for materials and finishes. The Queensland Governor, Sir Alan Mansfield, planted a time capsule in the foundations on 28 November 1971. Utilising reject bricks that had chipped corners or minor irregularities of shape effected a major saving. Blair Wilson subsequently won the Industry Clay Brick Award for creative use of brick and the distinctive dark bricks forming a curvaceous box are a strong feature of the design. It was felt by a number of people visiting the theatre that the slight irregularities of the bricks imparted character and a demand for similar bricks were experienced by the supplier. Externally a small courtyard leading off the foyer proved a pleasant social space for use at intermission. The interior had tiers of seating on all four sides of the building surrounding a central stage. One bank of seats was made removable. The finish was simple and modern with a suspended black ceiling and exposed brick walls. Tunnels under the seating tiers allowed performers to move around the theatre without being visible. The succeeding Governor, Sir Colin Hannah, officially opened the theatre on 11 June 1972. The Courier-Mail noted at the time that the Brisbane Repertory Theatre had made Australian theatre history by owning the first theatre in the country to be designed and built \\"in the round\\", a significant departure from traditional theatre design. Internal changes have occurred to the theatre since, but the essential design elements remain. In 1988 seats from the Expo 88 Russian Pavilion replaced the original seating. Brisbane Repertory Theatre continued to be innovative and established the Early Childhood Drama Project in 1975 and held its first season of all Australian plays in 1980. In 1993 it became a professional company. As such, its needs were somewhat different than those of the amateur company for which the theatre was designed. There was a need for more space and, concurrently, the development of nearby Lang Park stadium reduced car parking for La Boite patrons, prompting consideration of a move. In 1996 La Boite incorporated as a non-profit organization. The theatre was used as a venue by the Queensland Theatre Company in the 1970s and continued to be used by a variety of local occasional companies, as well as presenting an annual season of productions by La Boite Theatre Inc. Since 2000 the Company has also been using the Powerhouse Theatre for performances. On 23 December 2001 it was announced that the theatre company would move to the new Creative Industries Complex of Queensland University of Technology at their Kelvin Grove campus, while administrative and rehearsal functions moved to the Thomas Dixon Centre at West End. Work began on the new theatre in 2002 and the Company moved into the new Roundhouse Theatre soon after. The La Boite Theatre Building on Hale Street was sold and converted into commercial premises.  Description  Cosi, 2003 La Boite Theatre illustrates its name, being literally a box-shaped brick building with rounded corners. It is constructed of dark reject bricks with texture created by variations in the way in which the bricks are laid in the lower section. The roof is metal clad and low pitched. The building is designed over three levels. On the ground floor is the foyer, flanked by small lobbies and a ticket office with the auditorium seating 200 behind it. This contains a central acting space with seating around it. Tunnels are located under the raked seating and provide access for the actors to different parts of the stage. There is rehearsal space, a workshop, storage, office and dressing rooms in a basement area below the stage and a gallery above. A brick-paved courtyard opens off the foyer.  Heritage listing  La Boite Theatre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 January 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. La Boite Theatre illustrates the development of theatre in Queensland, as an arena theatre, which allowed the presentation of modern, flexible and intimate performances, reflecting trends in Europe and America, and rejuvenating amateur theatre in Queensland. It is also important as a purpose designed building for a longstanding and popular theatre company who have played an important role in the arts in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. La Boite Theatre is rare as the first purpose designed theatre-in- the-round in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The design for La Boite Theatre won a building industry award for the innovative use of material and is also innovative in form, the exterior expressing the name, which means \\"The Box\\" and was carried forward from the earlier theatre, converted from a cottage. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. La Boite Theatre is strongly connected with the development of the Brisbane Repertory Theatre Company, for which it was specifically designed and which has housed it for 30 years. The company took its name from the building when incorporated.

The body of the Dƒõv√≠n Mountain is strongly modulated, with outcrops and cliffs (klippe/crag) of pure, hard and white limestone of Later Jurassic origin, called Ernstbrunn limestone. Sedimentation of Ernstbrunn limestone was preceded by the sedimentation of grey calcareous Dƒõv√≠n-Kotel massif. Dƒõv√≠n claystone and clay limestone, called Klentnice layers. All the Pavlov Hills are situated at the margin of the flysch zone of the Northern Limestone Alps and Western Carpathians (South moravian carpathians). The flysch beds consist of strongly folded Lower Tertiary claystone, sandstone and conglomerate. During the periods of orogenetic activity in the Tertiary, large blocks of Jurassic and Early Cretaceous rocks were torn from their Jurassic base (now situated more lower - up to 2 km below the surface), and re-deposited over the younger flysch beds. In the Lower Badenian period (Upper Tertiary), the Pavlov Hills were surrounded by a warm sea. Pieces of Jurassic rock present in the littoral gravel from that period indicate that limestone may have been already denuded at that time. At 15 Ma BP (before present) a strong subsidence formed the Vienna Basin. During the following 9 Ma, up to 3 km thick layers of maritime and lacustrine sediments were deposited on its bottom.  Flora  Dƒõv√≠n as a whole eastern part of P√°lava lies in the northwest promontory of the Panonian plain.Pavlov Hills Botanical excursion guide It is the warmest and almost the most arid area in the Czech Republic, and therefore vines are cultivated here. Because of this climate some plant species that do not occur anywhere else in the country grow here. The colourful mosaic of arid rock grass, fringe tree communities, thermophilous bushes and thermophilous oakwoods on the Dƒõv√≠n slopes, which originated partly due to the influence of grazing, is called karst forest steppe. The Dƒõv√≠n forest plateaus are dominated by sparse loess oakwoods together with a species-rich herbaceous layer, while Panonian oak- hornbean dominates the north-facing slopes and valleys. Riparian forests with pedunculate oaks and narrow-leaved ashes and quite small areas of alluvial meadows have been preserved in the Dyje floodplain in the vicinity of K≈ôiv√© lake. Remains of halophytic vegetation, which occurred quite commonly on the salinated grazing land in South Moravia, still survive on the western bank of Nesyt pond near Sedlec.

After her marriage in 1935 she became a housewife, raising her daughter Phyllis and playing an active role in various voluntary organisations. Her reports of club activities gained her attention from local newspaper editors and by 1943 she was writing a regular column.Editorial Staff, \\"Hazel Garland: Female trailblazer\\", Pittsburgh Courier, January 27, 2011. Retrieved January 1, 2015. In 1946 she joined the staff of the Pittsburgh Courier full-time, and by 1960 she was editor of both the entertainment and the women's sections of the newspaper. In 1955 she became the first African-American journalist to write a regular television column, Video Vignettes, which would go on to become one of the longest running television columns in newspaper history. In 1974 Garland was made editor-in- chief, and in the same year she was named 'Editor of the Year' by the National Newspaper Publishers Association. She retired from her editorial role in 1977 due to health problems, although she continued writing and remained in an advisory role to the publishers until her death in 1988. In 1978 and 1979 she served as a juror for the Pulitzer Prize for journalism. Personal life Hazel B. Garland was born Hazel Barbara Maxine Hill near Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1913. She was the eldest of 16 children born to George and Hazel Hill, who were at that time farmers. After moving to Pennsylvania in the early 1920s, her father began working as a coal miner and the family eventually settled in Belle Vernon in 1932. As the eldest child, Hill was called on to assist her mother in raising her 15 younger siblings. She was an enthusiastic and talented student, and had hoped to continue with her education. However, before she could complete high school, her father requested that she drop out to allow a younger brother to continue, with the intention of his eventually attending college. Hill found work as a maid, while her younger brother would eventually refuse a college scholarship in favour of a failed relationship. Hill later recalled that her father was not in favour of female education, stating that it was a waste of money as they would eventually get married and stop working anyway. Although no longer attending school, Hill spent her spare time in the local library reading. She also spent time in the evenings dancing, singing and playing the drums for local bands, and for a short time considered a career in entertainment. While at a party, she met Percy Andrew Garland, a window display decorator and photographer from McKeesport, Pennsylvania. It was, however, during a church program when Garland played a trombone solo that they fell in love. On January 26, 1935, they were married and their only child, Phyllis, was born in October of that year. Throughout her career, Garland credited her family for supporting her achievements and encouraging her dedication to the paper.Kauffman Advisory Board for Women in Business \\"Salute to Hazel Garland\\", New Pittsburgh Courier, June 13, 1974.

Journalism career Early career After her marriage, Garland settled into life as a housewife and mother. With support from her mother-in- law she also became active in local voluntary organisations. As she was a keen writer, Garland was often asked to act as club reporter. In 1943 she was on the publicity committee for the local YWCA when the reporter due to cover a tea held in honour of the first black staff worker at the association became lost on the way and only arrived after the event had finished. As a club reporter, Garland had made her own notes during the afternoon, and was encouraged to write them up and send it to the newspaper. The editors at the Pittsburgh Courier were impressed, and asked her to cover similar community events for them as a stringer, for which she was paid $2 an article. Garland produced so much material that her articles were eventually combined into a column called Tri-City News, which began appearing in the Pittsburgh Courier in late 1943. At the time, mainstream media rarely carried any positive news about African-American communities or accomplishments, and Garland's naturally conversational tone and community-centric focus on weddings, honours, jobs and even tragedies along with her increasing reputation for professionalism, reliability and skilled writing quickly earned her a positive reputation. Columnist and editor By 1946, the Pittsburgh Courier was one of the most widely read black newspapers in the United States, and published a total of 14 editions, both local and national, as well as employing international reporters in cities around the world. That year, the paper offered to begin training some of its stringers to become full-time journalists, an opportunity that Garland was quick to take up. Initially providing vacation cover for other members of staff at the paper, she eventually became a general assignments reporter for the paper. This change was not universally welcomed by all her colleagues however and in one instance one of her male colleagues, resentful of a woman working in what he considered to be a man's job, deliberately sent Garland to cover a murder in a local brothel. Garland, who had never been into such an environment before, was somewhat alarmed, but simply paid another male colleague to accompany her and soon returned with all the details necessary for her story. In the same year, her column was retitled \\"Things to Talk About\\", and continued its community-oriented social coverage and conversational tone. Her contemporary at the paper, Frank E. Bolden, remarked that: > \\"She would give a wedding in the housing projects the same attention that > she would give to one in the upper echelon of what was then called Negro > society. When I asked about it, she'd say: \\"They're all human, and as long > as I'm doing this, that's how it's going to stay.\\" The clubs relied heavily > on Hazel to write about them, and the religious people too. Family > allegiance was a hallmark of her work. She has come from a small town where > life centred on the family. I think she wrote with such compassion because > she had such strong feeling for her own family.\\" Originally only covering local events, national or particularly prestigious social events were reported in the paper by Toki Johnson. However, eventually, versions of Things to Talk About would also be printed in both local and national editions of the paper, running right up to the month before Garland's death, for a total of 42 years. In 1952 the editors decided to start a magazine section, and appointed Garland as feature editor, the first woman at the paper to do so. In the same year, Garland was sent to rural South Carolina to cover the story of Maude E. Callen, a community nurse and midwife serving local black and white communities. Although male reporters were still frequently assigned to the best stories, the nature of this story meant that it considered more suitable for a women to cover. Garland's subsequent series of reports, entitled The Three I's: Ignorance, Illiteracy and Illegitimacy won a 1953 New York Newspaper Guild Page One Award for Journalism. > \\"The entries were numbered. They didn't name the newspaper or reporter who > wrote it, or mention whether the person was black or white. I won the award > for the best series. The prize was awarded at the Page One Ball.

In 1955 Garland started writing television column called Video Vignettes. At a time when the majority of mainstream TV columnists paid little attention to media diversity, Garland's column made particular note of occasions when black pe.rformers or broadcasters were dismissed, or when relevant shows were cancelled. To ensure that her point was made, she would also send copies of her columns to the network and station managers. Although the column largely focused on programs featuring African Americans, it still covered all the popular shows and Garland interviewed actors, writers or producers of any color who happened to be in Pittsburgh, such as actress Eartha Kitt.Williams, John L. (2013), America's Mistress: Eartha Kitt, Her Life and Times, Quercus Publishing, \\"Video Vignettes\\" ran from 1955 to one month before Garland's death in 1988, a total of 33 years, one of the longest-running newspaper television columns in history. In 1960 Garland was promoted from feature editor to women's editor of the magazine, but a financial recession in Chicago, declining circulation of the Courier and increasing coverage of black issues in mainstream newspapers had led to serious financial problems at the paper. In spite of bouncing pay checks, Garland continued writing for the paper. She commented \\"I loved the Courier. It was everything to me. I had spent the greater part of my life there, so I wanted to work even if I didn't get paid. I thought maybe we could hold on a keep it together.\\" Editor-in- chief As a result of its financial troubles, in 1966 the Pittsburgh Courier was bought out by John H. Sengstacke, publisher of the Chicago Defender, and renamed the New Pittsburgh Courier. At the time Garland was the editor of both the entertainment and women's sections of the paper, but in 1972 Sengstacke offered her the post of city editor, which was considered a management level role. Not all of her colleagues at the paper agreed with this promotion, and Garland was still subject to some harassment from her co-workers. In 1974 Garland was promoted again, this time to editor-in-chief, the first African- American woman to do so at any newspaper in the United States. Before she accepted the post, Garland made absolutely sure that the offer was genuine and not a token concession without real authority. The role was a demanding one and Garland spent many hours away from her family, reorganising the paper into a more up to date format, developing new beats and expanding some existing sections to appeal to a broader audience. Although there had been other women in high-profile positions at the Pittsburgh Courier, Garland was the first to achieve a hands-on management role, and had daily input into the running of the paper. By the time she was promoted to editor, she had been assisting with layout, article illustration and design for a number of years. When asked about it a number of years later, friend and journalist Frank E. Boulden said: > \\"Without her the Courier would have folded during that period when > Sengstacke came in. Under her it became a better prepared product. She > didn't appreciate making mediocrity respectable. Hazel was one of two top > women in journalism, the other being Ethel Payne of the Chicago Defender.‚Äù In the same year she was promoted to editor-in-chief, Garland was also named 'editor of the year' by the National Newspaper Publishers Association. In 1975 she received a National Headliner award from Women in Communications. In 1976 the New Pittsburgh Courier won the John B. Russwurm award for the best national African-American newspaper, for which Garland herself won $500 and a life membership of the NAACP. Garland was also honoured that year by the Jewish women's group ORT America for 'bridging the gap between races'. In 1977 Garland retired from her editorial post due to ill health, but she continued writing her columns and took on an advisory role to Sengstacke one day a week. Legacy Hazel Garland was the first African-American woman to work her way from freelance writer to editor-in-chief of a national newspaper. She earned the respect of her colleagues, and where possible she tried to help younger people trying to get into journalism: \\"Just like others motivated, helped and assisted me, I've tried to do the same with other, especially all the young people coming through the doors at the Courier. I want to give back all the vast knowledge shared with me, by some very, very great people.\\" When asked to summarise her career, Garland said: > \\"We tell the stories. We tell the stories of the people. We told the stories > of Colored people, we told the stories of Negroes, we told the stories of > Black people and now we tell the stories of African-Americans. Does it > really matter, sports, social, entertainment, or political. They are all our > stories, and if we don't tell it, who will?\\" Further reading *Davis, Marianna W., ed.

Also: M√ºnsterbr√ºcke and M√ºnsterhof, and Rathausbr√ºcke‚ÄìWeinplatz (aerial photography by Eduard Spelterini c. mid-1890s) Bellevueplatz (\\"Bellevue Square\\", from the French bellevue meaning \\"beautiful sight\\") is a town square in Z√ºrich, Switzerland built in 1856. Named after the former Grandhotel Bellevue on its north side, it is one of the nodal points for roads and public transportation in Z√ºrich, as well as an extension of the quaysides in Z√ºrich that were built between 1881 and 1887. Geography Bellevue is situated next to the much larger Sechsel√§utenplatz (Sechsel√§uten Square) to the south of Bellevue. To the east is the Quaibr√ºcke (Quay Bridge) on the Lake Z√ºrich shore, next to the outflow of the lake into the Limmat. To the north is the Limmatquai, a street running along the riverbank. To the west is Utoquai, a lakefront quay. The square is bound by the streets Theaterstrasse to the east, R√§mistrasse to north, and the Schoeckstrasse to the south. The square is about north-west of the Stadelhofen railway station.  Transportation  The square is one of the nodal points of Z√ºrich tram lines 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15, as well the regional bus lines 912 and 916, being the border between Rathaus and Hochschulen quarters. The square was not used in the classical sense as a public square for recreation until the adjoining Sechsel√§utenplatz was rebuilt in 2013 for public use.  Points of interest  In addition to the Sechsel√§utenplatz and quaysides, there is also Caf√© Odeon, where writers and the Z√ºrich Boh√®me would meet, the Kronenhalle and Vorderer Sternen restaurants, and the Limmatquai and other attractions downstream along the Limmat.

History  Located on what was once swampland between the Limmat and Lake Z√ºrich, prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Z√ºrich were discovered dating to the Neolithic and Bronze Age. They were built on small islands and peninsulas and set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona. Z√ºrich‚ÄìEnge Alpenquai is located on the Lake Z√ºrich lakeshore in Enge, a locality of the municipality of Z√ºrich. It was neighbored by similar settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner on what was then a peninsula in the effluence of the lake, within an area of about within the present city of Z√ºrich. The settlement sites are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, and in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class object. copperplate print by Johann Heinrich Vogel, showing the area in 1705 Kohlep√∂rtli gate at the present Sechsel√§utenplatz, Franz Hegi and Matthias Pfenninger, c. 1795 From 1558 to 1562 the round Auf Dorf bastion with battlements was built at the site of the present Bellevueplatz at the junction of Limmatquai and R√§mistrasse. Structurally, it was connected to the Langen√∂hrlisturm of the city fortification, and was originally surrounded almost entirely by the water of Lake Z√ºrich. The bulwark comprised casemates with loopholes and a platform for artillery to defend against attackers on the lake. It complemented the Bausch√§nzli bastion on the western side of the Limmat, and the medieval Grendeltor, a river gate and customs station that stood on the site of Haus Bellevue. Around 1700, after the construction of embankments, the bulwark lost its original function. Equipped with a solid roof, the area served as a salt house. Until 1795 the construction of a new seawall was carried out, and at the Kohlep√∂rtli gate, goods were transhipped between Lake Z√ºrich and Limmat. Remains from the c. 1830 demolition were discovered on occasion of road works in March 2015. First mentioned in 1863, the square was named after the hotel Bellevue, which was built at Limmatquai 1 in 1856. In mid-October 1937, Hermann Herter's design for the Bellevue- Rondell, to replace an old station concourse, was under construction at the square. While the heavy iron canopy was being raised a hoist broke and a worker fell to the ground with the structure. There were no injuries. Despite the official name Bellevueplatz, it is often dubbed by the locals as das Bellevue, and is now one of the most important transport hubs in the city, for public transport as well as road traffic. Like the B√ºrkliplatz square on the opposite side of the Quaibr√ºcke, Bellevueplatz is used for Sechsel√§uten and other public festivals, so traffic operations have to be stopped several times each year.  Renewal  Bellevueplatz was renovated between March and 25 October 2015, with minor corrections in November 2015, during which the tram lines were redirected from June to mid-August. The edges of the tram tracks are designed to not cause obstruction, and the tracks at R√§mistrasse between Caf√© Odeon and Quaibr√ºcke were rearranged and separated from bicycle lanes. As part of the road renewal works, the pedestrian crossings from Bellevue to Utoquai and from Sechsel√§utenplatz to Utoquai have been provided with a protective island that is tactilely detectable for visually impaired people.

It was renamed The Smart Home after being refurbished in 2013. The house was originally intended to showcase innovations in design and construction, building intelligence, and environmental performance. The INTEGER design included many innovative features, including environmental technology such as a green roof and a grey water recycling system, home automation that included a building management system and an intelligent security system, and innovative technical systems such as under- floor trench heating. In 2013, the house was refurbished and retrofitted with a variety of new and upgraded features, including a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) array, which altogether halved its carbon emissions and increased its energy efficiency by 50%. Since its creation, the house has garnered numerous awards, appeared on Tomorrow's World on BBC Television, hosted thousands of visitors, and influenced mainstream construction.  Design and construction  The origins of the INTEGER Millennium House date to a May 1996 seminar about green building, which catalysed the formation of the INTEGER building design and consultancy team to \\"evaluate available design and technical solutions to improve housing performance\\". The efforts of this design team resulted in the creation of a scale model of a house, which has subsequently been widely exhibited at institutions such as the Science Museum, London as well as profiled in the DK Eyewitness Book Future. Damian Bree, Tim Day, Paul Hodgkins, and Nicholas Thompson began designing the INTEGER Millennium House itself in October 1997, a process that proceeded for 10 weeks. Built on the Building Research Establishment (BRE)'s Innovation Park property in Garston, Watford, the actual construction of the house took 13 weeks before it opened to the public in 1998. The resulting single-family, three-bedroom, demonstration house was intended to be a global showcase for innovations in design and construction, building intelligence, and environmental performance, as well as to raise general awareness about environmental design and sustainable construction. Built as a demonstration project without a budget, the INTEGER Millennium House benefited from expertise and materials that were donated by suppliers without any cost to the project. The entire house was constructed with standard components, many of which were prefabricated, including concrete for the floor slabs and timber for the superstructure, cladding, and frame. Neither prototypes nor experimental components were used in the building of the house.  Features  As originally built, the INTEGER Millennium House included numerous examples of environmental technology, including a green roof, wind turbine, solar photovoltaic panels, and solar water heaters capable of heating water up to . The house also featured a geothermal heat pump, rainwater collection and retention for both washing cars and watering gardens, and a grey water recycling system that reuses waste water from bathing and washing for toilet flushing, reducing water usage by roughly 30%. Additionally, the south side of the house was built as a three-story glass conservatory designed to provide passive heat gain, although in direct sunlight it could overheat. Altogether, the house achieved \\"Level 4 +\\" environmental performance according to the Code for Sustainable Homes. The INTEGER Millennium House was also built with a variety of intelligent home automation technologies, including a building management system that could optimize the performance of the heating system, an automatic garden irrigation system that could sense soil humidity conditions and water accordingly, an intelligent security system, lighting that could be set to one of four predefined moods, and microchip-embedded programmable door keys. The house also featured advanced communication technologies such as a telephone service distributed via a local building exchange, digital satellite and terrestrial television available in every room, WebTV, and a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system. Furthermore, the INTEGER Millennium House included numerous innovative technical systems, including under-floor trench heating controlled individually in each room by thermostat, a central service core containing all of the house's cables and pipes in a vertical space designed to provide easy access for maintenance and upgrade, and timber-framed bathroom modules similar to those built for use in the off-shore oil drilling industry.  Refurbishment  In 2013, the BRE and British Gas collaborated to refurbish and retrofit the INTEGER Millennium House, which they renamed The Smart Home. As with the original build, there were neither budgets nor contracts for the refurbishment of The Smart Home, and many suppliers donated products and expertise to the effort. Chief among the upgrades are a \\"whole house living system\\" that uses occupation sensors to control heating, lighting, security, ventilation, and water, a new solar thermal system along with an upgraded solar water heating system, and a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) array within the glazing of the conservatory glass itself that generates electricity in addition to providing shade. Built by Polysolar and rated at , the BIPV array provides The Smart Home with approximately of electricity annually, accounting for all of the house's daytime electric needs and approximately a third of its total energy requirements while also saving of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the thin film material used in the BIPV array allows it to absorb ambient and reflective light on both sides of the glass, which allows it to operate in most weather conditions. Additionally, it allows the red light that is vital for photosynthesis to pass through, making the glass conservatory highly suitable for growing plants. Hamish Watson, the CEO of Polysolar, described the use of such BIPV arrays as \\"an effective way of including energy micro-generation into the fabric of a building\\". Other upgrades made during the retrofit include the application of heat-reflective paint, insulating plaster, and phase changing material to improve the house's thermal performance, the use of light-reflective particles in interior paint to reduce lighting needs, and various other green and energy-efficient features, such as double-glazed doors and windows, ducted skirting, and reclaimed timber floors. In all, the upgrades made to the house halved its carbon emissions and increased its energy efficiency by 50%, while also upgrading the building's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from E to A/B. The Smart Home was officially opened to the public on 2 October 2013 by Dorothy Thornhill, the Mayor of Watford, and Kerry Pollard, a former member of parliament from St Albans who had supported the original INTEGER project in 1998.  Awards and impact  In its original iteration, the INTEGER Millennium House garnered numerous awards, including the European Intelligent Building of the Year (1998), the National Homebuilders Award for Ecology (1999), the Homes Award for Innovation (2000), and the National Homebuilders Award for House of the Future (2003). Furthermore, the house was featured on two BBC Television programmes, both Tomorrow's World and a six-part special series entitled DreamHouse. Between its opening as the INTEGER Millennium House in 1998 and its refurbishment as The Smart Home in 2013, the house was visited by more than 5,000 people. Additionally, many of the building's innovative features and technologies have been integrated into mainstream construction. For instance, by April 2001, 12 two-bedroom flats with INTEGER-inspired features had been built in Harlow, Essex. Core INTEGER-style technologies that were used in the flats included enhanced insulation and a high-efficiency communal boiler system that reduced energy demand by 50%, as well as reduced servicing by replacing 12 small boilers with two large ones, and a grey water recycling system that reduced water consumption by 30%.

The poet's life was mentioned in the first of its kind, 1829 AD 's work- 'Biographical Sketches of Dekkan poets' \\\\- by Cavelly Venkata Ramaswamie. The same poet was referred as 'Vemulawada, Vemulaada,Lemulawada,Lemulaada' Bheema kavi. The above four names are colloquial names of Vemulawada, Karimnagar district even till today.  Early life  The poet was born at Vemula Vada,in the province of Veligandala(Karimnagar) to a widow.See birthplace controversy. He was born to a widow who is a Lema(a young woman) with the blessings of the Vemulawada Bheemeshwara Swamy. The poet lived in the 11th century or between 12th-13th centuries He travelled to different foreign countries, such as Karnata,Maharatta,Sajanagar(near Peddapuram, East Godavari district which was ruled by Kalingas and Eastern Chalukyas or Vengi Chalukyas) All the wonders performed by Bhima kavi,however are in the mouths of all the women and children in most of the Telinga provinces,for his name is very popular,and all the wonders he performed as handed down by tradition, universally credited as real facts.  Birth Place Controversy  First Generation scholar (1829) Cavelly Venkata Ramaswamie in his 1829 work identifies him with Lemulawada(Vemulawada, Karimnagar district). Majority of next generation scholars(1900s) such as Manavalli Ramakrishna kavi, Jayanti Ramayya Pantulu,Seshadri Ramana Kavulu too place him to be a native of Vemulawada, Karimnagar district (alias Lemulavada) due to the below majority evidences. The Kendra Sahitya Academy also opines the same. The same poet was referred as 'Vemulawada, Vemulaada,Lemulawada,Lemulaada' Bheema kavi. The above four names are colloquial names of Vemulawada, Karimnagar district even till today. A minority of new generation scholars probably who have no knowledge of Vemulawada,Karimnagar confused with Vemulawada, East Godavari district ( originally called 'Vengulawada' and not 'Vemgulawada'.

Some jester poets have appended some strange things to Kavijanasrayam's appendix. Scholars suggest that the assignment of a Vaidiki to a Jain author who belong to different centuries could be one of them.

B√ºrkliplatz is a town square in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. It is named after Arnold B√ºrkli, and is one of nodal points of the road and public transportation, and of the lake shore promenades that were built between 1881 and 1887. The tree-shaded square between Bahnhofstrasse and Fraum√ºnsterstrasse is called Stadthausanlage.  Geography  B√ºrkliplatz is situated in the historic Alpenquai area near Lake Zurich. It is immediately to the west of the Quaibr√ºcke (Quay Bridge) which crosses the river Limmat at the outflow of the lake known as the lake shore promenades or Quaianlagen. The B√ºrkliplatz is the only square between the General-Guisan-Quai and the Quaibr√ºcke with a tram stop of the same name. The tree-shaded square between the Bahnhofstrasse on the west and the Fraum√ºnsterstrasse on the east and the B√ºrklilatz in the south is called Stadthausanlage (City Hall Enclosure).  Transportation  B√ºrkliplatz landing gate towards General-Guisan-Quai, Dampfschiff Stadt Rapperswil on occasion of one of its centennial roundtrips The square is one of the nodal points of the Z√ºrich tram system, with lines 2, 5, 8, 9 and 11 passing through it, as well as regional bus lines 161 and 165, on the boundary between Lindenhof and Enge quarters. The Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG; Lake Zurich shipping company) has the terminus of its route to Rapperswil here, and there is also a stop for the Limmat tour boats towards Z√ºrichhorn.  Points of interest  In addition to the Seeuferanlage (lakeshore park) and the neighbouring Uto and General Guisan quays, there is nearby the Arboretum Z√ºrich which houses Voliere an aviary and veterinary hospital, and the so- called Vogelpflegestation, a sanctuary for birds. Among other points of interest is the floral clock at the outflow of the Schanzengraben moat, a corner where waterfowl look for food at the east of the B√ºrkliterrasse, and the Geiser monumental fountain.

There is also a kiosk and the historical Musikpavillon, where public concerts are still sometimes held, and the Swiss National Bank building, and the Bausch√§nzli at the Stadthausquai.  Geiserbrunnen  Geiserbrunnen The monumental fountain bears the name of the former city architect, Arnold Geiser (1844-1909), whose legacy of 40,000 Swiss francs financed the erection of a \\"monumental fountain to beautify the city\\". On the occasion of an art competition held by the city government, Jakob Br√ºllmann sculpted the war memorial-like Stierb√§ndiger Brunnen, better known as Geiserbrunnen which was inaugurated on 20 October 1911.  B√ºrkliterrasse  B√ºrkliterrasse B√ºrkliterrasse in the foreground, Zimmerberg and Albis-Felsenegg in the background. B√ºrkliterrasse, also named after Arnold B√ºrkli, is situated on the lake front. It was designed as a culmination of the Bahnhofstrasse and the lakeshore promenades. At its inauguration in 1887, the terrace was crowned by two huge plaster lions by Urs Eggenschwyler; however, they found little favor with the citizens and were removed two years later. Since 1952, the sculpture by Hermann Hubacher adorns the trees, showing the Abduction from Olympus, Zeus in the form of an eagle and his beautiful lover Ganymede. The original elm trees became diseased and were replaced by ball maples. The B√ºrkliterrasse is listed in the inventory of notable gardens and grounds of local importance which was established in 1989 as Inventar der sch√ºtzenswerten G√§rten und Anlagen von kommunaler Bedeutung (Inventory of the gardens and parks of communal significance and worthy of protection).  Stadthausanlage  The upper end of the Bahnhofstrasse is today's most popular place for market events. This popular, rather small, urban facility, became important at the time of the construction of the Bahnhofstrasse and the quay promenades, and became the elegant meeting point of Z√ºrich's bourgeoisie. The still existing Musikpavillon was built by the Robert Maillard in 1908, and has excellent acoustics. The site's increasing use and the ageing of the trees forced the city government to develop a new design concept, which was based on the idea of redesigning this important market and venue area as a single tree-lined square. A Cedrus libani that was planted in the 1900s is one of the few remaining trees of that era.  History   Prehistory  Stadt Rapperswil and Stadt Z√ºrich Quaibr√ºcke area around 1884 Located in Zurich on what was then swampland between the Limmat and Lake Zurich around Sechsel√§utzenplatz on small islands and peninsulas, dwellings were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona tivers. Z√ºrich‚ÄìEnge Alpenquai is located on the Lake Zurich lakeshore in Enge, a locality in the municipality of Z√ºrich. There were neighbouring settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner on what were then a peninsula and an island at the outflow of the lake to the Limmat, within an area of about within the city of Z√ºrich. As well as being one of the fifty-six Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site (Prehistoric Pile Dwellings Around the Alps), the settlements are also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a \\"Class Object\\". Despite the dredging for the construction of the Seequai between 1916 and 1919, an area of as much as with two cultural layers was preserved. Pile shoes were found at different levels in the cultural layers. A rich bar decoration of ceramics was found only in the lower layer, while the decoration on cannelure groups was limited to the upper layer, as well as some graphite-decorated fragments. So-called Potin lumps, the largest weighing , were found at Alpenquai in 1890. They consist of about 18,000 coins originating from the Celtic Eastern Gaul, others are of the Z√ºrich type, that were identified with the local Helvetii tribe, and date to around 100 BC. The find is unique so far, and from the scientific research, it appears that the melting down of the lumps was not completed, therefore the aim was to form cultic offerings. The site of the find was at that time at least from the lake shore, and probably in water at a depth of to .Keltisches Geld in Z√ºrich: Der spektakul√§re ¬´Potinklumpen¬ª. Amt f√ºr St√§dtebau der Stadt Z√ºrich, Stadtarch√§ologie, Z√ºrich October 2007.  Modern history  Stadthausanlage, the site of the former Kratzquartier accommodation and Bauhaus district at the Bausch√§nzli, was added in 1833 by landfill made up of rubble from the Baroque city fortification along the lake shore. This also marked the end of the medieval Kratzquartier as the distinctive urban axis, extending from Zentralhof, Kappelerhof and M√ºnsterhof towards the B√ºrkliterrasse, where the poorer citizens of Z√ºrich once lived. The medieval quarter was thoroughly overhauled between 1836 and 1900, for the purpose of developing a 'modern lakeshore city' in this large area. The area was reserved for the construction of new representative commerce buildings and the new federal parliament building, which was never built, but the Stadthaus was constructed at the former site of the Fraum√ºnster abbey's building. As in 1848 the parliament building was erected in Bern. The site was used for a public city park that was named after the nearby old town hall (Stadthaus), and in 1922 the Swiss National Bank building was added. B√ºrkliplatz is named for Arnold B√ºrkli (1833-1894), the engineer responsible for the construction of the city's quays. The men's bathhouse, built in 1883 alongside the B√ºrkliterrasse, was seriously damaged by a storm in 1964 and had to be demolished. From 1803 to 1886 the square was named Stadthausplatz, but the term is still in official use for the park area.

The surviving structure is Romanesque and Gothic. It was founded in 1134 as a daughter house of Morimond Abbey near Dijon, from which it took its name (meaning \\"die to the world\\").. History Origins The history of the abbey begins on October 4, 1134 when a group of founding monks arrived from the mother house of Morimond in France. The monks settled in Coronate (now a frazione of Morimondo) and later chose the location for their monastery in Morimondo, about a mile away. Probably, the monastery was already partially built when they moved in Morimondo on November 11, 1136. Soon after its foundation the abbey acquired patrons and postulants from all social classes and the community of the monks had a rapid growth in the number of vocations. Even before the construction of the church, the monks founded two further communities, in Acquafredda. near Como (1143) and in Casalvolone. near Novara (1169). Further proofs of the flourishing activity in Morimondo are the Scriptorium, aimed at creating the monastic library and at supplying the two new subsidiaries with some basic books, and the large agricultural holdings. Several granges were in fact settled in the surroundings. The building of the church began in 1182 and was finished in 1296. There was a delay with respect to the building of the monastery and it was due to disputes with the clergy of Casorate, a village few miles from Morimondo. A long interruptions (probably a few years) occurred after December 1237 when the monastery was assaulted by Pavian troops and various monks were killed. Indeed, militants from Pavia and Milan often looted the area and wars hampered the success of the abbey. Frederick Barbarossa and his troops looted Morimondo in 1161. An interruptions occurred also in 1245 due, once again, to the raids of the imperial troops. 14th and 15th centuries At its peak the community numbered 50 choir monks (monks, priests who worked in the scriptorium) and 200 conversi (Lay Brothers who had taken the vow of poverty, had donated their properties to the monastery, had become members of the monastic community, and were in charge of the management of the productive activities of the monastery and relations with the outside world). A slow decline began in the 14th century due to external situations. Some of them are the looting in 1314 and the change into a Commandery in 1450, a conversion which occurred for all abbeys with Cardinal Giovanni Visconti, Archbishop of Milan, and Commander and Abbot of Morimondo. Abbots after Giovanni Visconti include Cardinal Branda Castiglioni, a humanist, and Giovanni de' Medici, later Pope Leo X. Being concerned to revive the spiritual life of Morimondo, in 1499 Giovanni de' Medici sent eight monks from the Cistercian abbey of Settimo Fiorentino to Morimondo. 16th-18th centuries The restored stability led to reconstruction of the cloister around the year 1500, the reconstruction of the portal of the sacristy, the painting of the fresco of the Madonna and Child (1515) attributed to Bernardino Luini, and finally the carved wooden choir of 1522. In 1564 the abbey became a parish after a decision of St. Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, and the change gave new fervor to Morimondo. In the same year Borromeo stripped the Abbey of its land- holdings, in order to give financial aid to the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. Another fervent period was in the 17th century when the abbot Antonio Libanori (1648-1652) from Ferrara was able to effect a revival of the cultural and spiritual life of the monastic community. During the 18th century, palaces were built at the north and west borders of the cloister. The abbey was suppressed on May 31, 1798 in the wake of the French Revolution; the presence of the Cistercian monks was stopped, and the illuminated manuscript of the library were dispersed. 19th-21st centuries From 1805 to 1950, priests at the former monastic church continued to minister the parish. In 1941 the Blessed Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster, archbishop of Milan, bemoaning the relinquished monastery, made a contact with the Trappist Fathers of the Cistercian Order of the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome. Then, in 1950, the Congregation of the Oblates of the Virgin Mary was settled in the monastery. In 1991, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini entrusted the pastoral care of the parish to the Congregation of the Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary with a new call to revive the abbey of Morimondo as a center of spirituality. The \\"Fondazione Abbatia Sancte Marie de Morimundo\\" aims at promoting the cultural and religious heritage of the abbey by organizing seminars, exhibitions, visits to the church and nearby building.Foundation's website. The abbey has been used as a set for Cado dalle nubi, a 2006 movie on immigration from South Italy starring Checco Zalone, and for Benedetti dal Signore, a 2004 Italian television series set in a convent of Franciscan friars. The abbey has given the name to the Rotary Club Morimondo AbbaziaClub's website which was founded in 2013, a parallel being acknowledged between the compassionate and industrious attitude of Cistercian monks and the rotarian commitment to \\"service above self\\".Rotary's mottoes The Foundation Abbatia Sancte Marie de Morimundo was established on April 17, 1993 as a non- profit private foundation recognized on July 12, 1994 by the Italian Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Heritage (act no. 149, entry 1800/a). The Foundation is named after the ex libris of the illuminated manuscripts produced in the monastic scriptorium in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The aims of the Foundation are to develop cultural and religious activities at the Morimondo Abbey and to promote the maintenance of the architectural heritage of the monastery. In December 2007, the Lombardy Region has recognized the monastery as a regional museum, run by the Foundation Abbatia Sancte Marie de Morimundo. The museum is divided into two sections: - The Museum of the Abbey, which was created to promote the whole buildings of the Cistercian abbey (cloister, chapter house, working rooms of the monks, hall of the founders, porch, dining hall, dormitory) - The Civic Museum Angelo Comolli, an Art Nouveau painter and fresco painter.Visita Milano website. The monastery A peculiarity of the Morimondo Abbey is to be built on several floors at the side of a depression. The floor of the cloister, in its whole monastic parts, is the third floor and tops two levels of large rooms with a vaulted ceiling supported by columns. Moreover, the monks' dormitory (originally a single room) is just over the chapter house. The presence of different levels is apparent in eastern and southern parts of the monastery, but it can be seen also in the Lay Brothers buildings. The Church The nave While Morimondo Abbey is the fourth Cistercian monastery founded in Italy (1134) and the first in Lombardy, the abbey church is quite different from all other 12th century Cistercian buildings. The church construction being postponed till 1182, previous architectural experiences were exploited and surpassed. In fact, the Cistercian architecture in Morimondo Abbey adopts some gothic features, e.g. the cross vaulted arches, which can also create rectangular spans. Spans with a rectangular basis in the nave are paired with spans with a square basis in the side naves and the sense of verticality is dramatically increased. The magnificence of Morimondo is related to its eight spans while previous abbey churches are smaller. The majesty of the church of Morimondo comes mainly from its total essentiality and the message of order given by the bricks. The Renaissance and Baroque styles did not alter the spirit of the twelfth century building. Wooden choir The choir The current wooden choir replaces the original stalls and was fabricated in 1522 by Francesco Giramo, an artist from Abbiategrasso. It is an interesting example of Renaissance wooden furniture as shown by the compact and architectural design, which is after the style promoted in Lombardy by Bramante, and by the technique used to engrave the figures, which were curved with woodcuts made with hot iron. The represented symbols hint to its use as a place of worship. Although derived from classical antiquity according to the Renaissance style, they represent spiritual values such as generosity of the God‚Äôs gifts (the fruit basket) or the saving action of Christ (the fish). Cloister In the cloister the layout typical of a Cistercian monastery is still legible despite successive interventions (the three arcades built in 1500 - 1505 and the north and west sides raised in mid eighteenth century). The chapter house is fully maintaining its original features, and the refectory and the kitchen, now having a beautiful seventeenth-century style, is nevertheless reminiscent of the original layout. The granges The term grange (from Latin granea, a building for grain storage) was used to designate a rural productive site. It was built on a pre-existing agricultural structure, or from scratch. The [ grange had great autonomy from the home abbey, although a Lay Brother was ruling the grange. Necessities were growing with the number of monks and the development of the structure. Agriculture was the main source of material goods and the granges were the frame allowing for an effective agricultural activity. They also served as a repository of corn and equipment and as Lay Brother dwellings.

It was founded by former Blood Warriors members Akira Tozawa, BxB Hulk, Cyber Kong, Tomahawk T.T., and Kzy. On August 1, 2013, after Tozawa had led MAD BLANKEY to victory against -akatsuki- in a match, where the losing stable would have to disband, the rest of MAD BLANKEY turned on him, kicking him out of the group and assuming YAMATO their new leader. On August 16, 2015 MAD BLANKEY was forced to disband after losing to Jimmyz in a 5-on-5 elimination tag team match, where they were betrayed by K-Ness, who had defected to the Jimmyz. History Tozawa era (2012‚Äì2013) On March 1, 2012 Akira Tozawa renamed the Blood Warriors as MAD BLANKEY. The name is a combination of musical groups Mad Capsule Markets and Blankey Jet City, of which BxB Hulk is a fan of. Hulk also created the unit logo and colour scheme. Three days later, he and BxB Hulk lost the Open the Twin Gate Championship to Jimmy Kagetora and Jimmy Susumu. Super Shenlong joined in March, changing his name to Mondai Ryu. On June 10, 2012, Hulk and Naoki Tanisaki won the Open the Twin Gate Championship from Jimmy Kagetora and Jimmy Susumu. However, they lost the belts back to them on June 17 in a 3-way elimination tag team match which also included WindowsMG members K-ness and Kenichiro Arai. On August 19, Hulk, Tozawa and Tanisaki defeated CIMA, Gamma and Magnitude Kishiwada to win the 2012 Summer Adventure Tag League and the vacant Open the Triangle Gate Championship. On September 23, Mad Blankey defended the Open the Triangle Gate Championship against the Jimmyz (Genki Horiguchi H.A.Gee.Mee!!, Ryo \\"Jimmy\\" Saito and Naoki Tanizaki), with the added stipulation that if Mad Blankey won the match they would also win the rights to the \\"Naoki Tanizaki\\" name. Mad Blankey won the match and thus the rights to the name. After the match, the defeated former-Tanizaki wanted to rename himself to Naoki Jimmy, but the victorious Tanisaki claimed the right to choose Tanizaki's new name. Saying that Tanizaki's whining and crying reminded him of the \\"kyu kyu\\" noise a dolphin makes, he renamed Tanizaki to Mr. Kyu Kyu Toyonaka Dolphin. On October 21, 2013 Mad Blankey lost the Triangle Gate championship to Kaettekita Veteran-gun (Gamma, HUB and Magnitude Kishiwada). Following a failed challenge at the Open the Twin Gate Championship on December 23, 2012, Cyber Kong was kicked out of MAD BLANKEY. On June 15, 2013, Hulk and Tozawa regained the Open the Twin Gate Championship from Shingo Takagi and YAMATO, when YAMATO turned on Takagi and joined MAD BLANKEY. The feud between the current and the former Naoki Tanizaki saw \\"Mr. Kyu Kyu Toyonaka Dolphin\\" win the 2013 New Year Dragon Scramble match over, among others, Naoki Tanisaki.January 12, 2013 A few weeks later the two faced off in a \\"loser leaves town\\" match, which initially saw Tanisaki win, only to have an immediate rematch take place with the same stipulation, won by Tonoyaka Dolphin, negating the results of the earlier match and giving Naoki Tanizaki the rights back to his name. He also renamed the fake Tanisaki \\"Mr. Pii Pii Tomakomai Penguin\\". The rivalry culminated on February 11, when the Jimmyz defeated Mad Blankey in a five-on-five elimination tag team match, as a result of which Penguin was exiled from Dragon Gate. After the match, Tanizaki shook hands with Penguin and offered to team with him in the future. Tanizaki then also fought off Mad Blankey, when they turned on Penguin for losing the match. On February 15, Penguin teamed with Tanizaki, who worked as \\"Mr. Kyu Kyu Naoki Tanizaki Toyonaka Dolphin\\", in a tag team match, where the two lost to Tozawa and Hulk. Hulk and Tozawa would go on to lose the Open the Twin Gate Championship to Naruki Doi and Ricochet on July 21. Yamato era (2013‚Äì2015) On August 1, 2013, after Tozawa had led Mad Blankey to victory against -akatsuki- in a match, where the losing stable would have to disband, the rest of Mad Blankey turned on him, kicking him out of the group and assuming Yamato their new leader. On August 23, Yamato defeated Shingo Takagi to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship. On August 30, Mad Blankey turned on Uhaa Nation after he refused to wrestle Akira Tozawa Cyber Kong would also rejoin Mad Blankey on the same night.

On December 5, Mad Blankey also lost the Open the Triangle Gate Championship to Millennials (Eita, Flamita and T-Hawk). On May 5, 2014, Yamato won the Open the Dream Gate Championship for a record-tying third time by defeating Ricochet. On the same night, after being the last to escape and win the Cage match at Dead or Alive 2014, Hulk quit Mad Blankey, thus turning face. On June 5, Mad Blankey defeated Hulk in a five on one handicap match to retain the naming rights of Mad Blankey when Hulk was attacked by Dr. Muscle. Dr. Muscle was later revealed to be Punch Tominaga. Yamato lost the title to former Mad Blankey stablemate BxB Hulk on July 20. After Kzy and Doi both suffered long-term injuries, Mad Blankey added some temporary members which were picked by \\"Miracle Doi Darts\\" and were CIMA, Gamma, Don Fujii and K-ness. On December 28, Cyber Kong and Yamato would defeat the Millennials (Eita and T-Hawk) for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. Kzy would return from his injury on January 10, 2015 as Dr. Muscle to participate in the Open the Brave Gate Championship tournament and two day later would defeat Eita in the finals to win his first Open the Brave Gate Championship.

However that year, Mariaheide split off from the St. Lambert Parish in Veghel, to form a new and separate parish, the Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish, and got its own church. In 1912, the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Mother of God from Veghel, founded the St. Nicholas Monastery in Mariaheide.

A Burmese militia led mule train carrying 16 tons of opium crossed into Laos to Ban Khwan, where they were attacked by rival drug smugglers from the Chinese Nationalists' Third and Fifth Armies. The intended recipient of the shipment, Royal Lao Army General Ouane Rattikone, bombed both sides while moving in troops to sweep the battlefield. With both Burmese militia and Nationalist Chinese defeated and expelled from Laos, the Lao general confiscated the opium for himself. With this supply of raw opium base, plus his greater grasp on the drug trade, Ouane's refineries began to ship their heroin worldwide. He also supplied this injectable heroin to his allies ‚Äî U.S. troops in the Vietnam War.  Background  As World War II ended, the French found themselves embroiled in the First Indochina War. On 23December 1950, the United States signed the Pentalateral Treaty with France, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam binding them to financially support the French effort. From that point onwards, the U.S. would fund an ever greater proportion of the French war effort; by 1952, it was funding about a third of the French budget for the war. Beginning as early as 6May 1953, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used its proprietary airline, Civil Air Transport, for combat supply drops in support of the French Army in Laos. Following the North Vietnamese 1953 invasion of Laos and the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the independence of the Kingdom of Laos was confirmed by international treaty on 20July 1954. In December 1955, the secretive Programs Evaluation Office was established in the American embassy in Vientiane, Laos to help the Royal Lao Government battle the communist insurgency.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì19. The CIA was the lead American agency in the American penetration of Laos that resulted in the Laotian Civil War. One of its agents, William Young, was a missionary's son recruited for his cultural understanding of hill tribes in northwestern Laos. He founded a base for a guerrilla force at Nam Yu, Laos, near the triple border junction of China, Burma, and Laos.Conboy and Morrison, pp. 164‚Äì166.Warner, pp. 74, 129‚Äì130. Marooned in the vicinity were the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese Army loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT) that had been stranded there when the Chinese Civil War ended in a communist victory. Although Young recruited some of the Nationalist Chinese soldiers into the Royal Lao Army's 101st Special Battalion (French: Bataillon Especiale 101 ‚Äì BE 101), many others became involved in the opium trade. Although they were funded by the Republic of China for intelligence activities and espionage, their money was cut off in 1961. When the KMT generals shifted to opium trading, they claimed it as a necessity to fund their armies. In short order, the KMT troops soon controlled 90 percent of the Burmese opium. Still maintaining their military capabilities, including a radio net for communications and weaponry that included crew-served weapons such as .50 caliber machine guns and 75mm recoilless rifles, the KMT would move caravans of 100 to 600 pack mules loaded with raw opium without interference. Their largest shipments contained nearly 20 tons of raw opium. They charged a \\"transit tax\\" on the opium they handled or protected.McCoy (1972), pp. 315‚Äì322. Opium train In February 1967, Shan Burmese warlord Khun Sa declared he was entitled to a \\"transit tax\\" from KMT opium shipments moving through the Wa State of Burma; the KMT had already claimed the prerogative of similarly extorting a fee of nine dollars per kilo for opium to cross the Burmese border into Thailand or Laos. Khun Sa's proclamation served as a declaration of war. He had his agents buy and gather 16 tons of opium from Wa and Kokang states for his mule train to transport from Ving Ngun, Burma into nearby northwestern Laos. There he would sell this record-setting $500,000 shipment to General Ouane Rattikone, the Royal Lao Army commander of that region of Laos. The caravan of hundreds of pack mules was escorted by 800 men from Khun Sa's army. They had a 200-mile trek from Burma to Ban Khwan in the Kingdom of Laos. Ouane's drug refinery was there. News of this double challenge to the KMT drug trade spread through their radio net. They monitored the Shan caravan's progress. It was obvious that if Khun Sa succeeded with the sale, he could arm an additional 1,000 troops for his army with the proceeds, achieving armed parity with the KMT.Gibson, Chapter 21.McCoy (1972), pp. 322‚Äì328. The remnants of the Kuomintang Third and Fifth Armies that existed on the Thai border with Burma were the ones customarily paid off to allow passage of opium. Khun Sa elected to ignore their charge for the border crossing. Consequently, his opium train was hotly pursued by between 700 and 1,000 Nationalist Chinese soldiers, who wanted either their payoff or the opium. They made their first attack as the caravan departed Kengtung. Khun Sa's rear guard drove off the attackers. On 14 and 15 July, the mile-long mule train crossed the Mekong River into Laos. Marching south from Muong Mounge, they reached Ban Khwan two days later. Once there, they moved into defensive positions in Ouane's sawmill. Located on a sand spit jutting into the river, the mill was only approachable by land through its boggy lumberyard. The Burmese barricaded themselves in behind the unmilled logs. As this was occurring, the local school principal had carried word of the invasion to the nearest RLA post at Ton Peung. In turn, they advised the principal that for safety's sake, the villagers should evacuate themselves across the river into Thailand. The Lao soldiers also radioed in a report on the incursion. The Chinese pursuit crossed the Mekong in the path of the fleeing Burmese on 24 July 1967, and marched south to Ban Khwan. After a preliminary skirmish, negotiations in the empty village began between the parties, with no result. A helicopter flew in from Ban Houayxay carrying the provincial RLA commander. He bore a message from General Ouane; both sides should get out of Laos. In return, Khun Sa's men received orders from him via radio to remain on station. The Nationalist Chinese demanded $250,000 as the price for their departure. A firefight between the Burmese and the Chinese followed on 29 July, using small arms, .50 caliber machine guns, 60mm mortars, and 57mm recoilless rifles. The following day at noon, as the fighting continued, six AT-28s of the Royal Lao Air Force bombed the battlefield. Unbeknown to the combatants, the Lao general had also received permission from Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma to fly the 2nd Paratroop Battalion to Ban Houayxay. From there they marched northward to block the southern exit from the battlefield. On the north side of Ban Khwan, a couple of RLA infantry battalions marched southward to block that egress. Two river patrol launches were sent to contest any crossing of the Mekong. As this occurred, the AT-28s from Luang Prabang struck four or five times daily for two days running, bombing both sides indiscriminately, men and mules alike. The 400 surviving Burmese muleteers and guards deserted their position in the face of the bombing and fled cross-river via boat back to Burma, leaving most of the opium cargo, their 82 dead, and 15 dead mules. The Nationalist Chinese had suffered 70 killed in action. Abandoning their dead, 24 machine guns, and their dead mules, they also fled the bombing, headed north up the Lao bank of the Mekong towards Burma because they lacked boats for a river crossing. Ten kilometers upon their way, they were blocked by the RLA infantry troops. A fortnight's impasse ensued, during which additional Lao troops flown in from Vientiane helped encircle the outnumbered KMT. The dispute was settled when Ouane struck a deal with the leaders of the caravan. According to one account, he would pay them only the customary transportation fees for the opium. Another version says that the Chinese paid $7,500 to Rattikone as a departure fee. Either way, essentially the Lao general gained an enormous amount of free opium when his paratroopers gathered it from the battlefield and shipped it to Ban Houei Sai. Ouane had had his sawmill bombarded, and his heroin refinery had burnt down during the fighting. However, he reputedly still had five more refineries working nearby. Ouane's damages were far outweighed by his gains. On 19 August, the 700 remaining KMT crossed the Mekong to land in Chiang Saen, Thailand. They resisted being disarmed by the Royal Thai Army. They returned to their bases at Mae Salong and Tham Ngop. Aftermath The resultant embarrassing bad publicity from the opium war brought on a Thai crackdown on all the Kuomintang remaining on their northern border. Prior to the 1967 Opium War, the Thais and KMT had preserved a fiction that the Chinese were civilian refugees seeking asylum. After the Chinese exposure caused by the battle at Ban Khwan, the Royal Thai Army began strictly supervising the Kuomintang units, insisting that their commanders be accountable for their troops. Eventually, the Thais would quietly legitimize the KMT as paramilitary units.McCoy, p. 329. The KMT's revenue from the opium trade was much diminished; their 15-year control of the smuggling routes, collecting their \\"transit tax\\", had ended with the fighting at Ban Khwan.McCoy, p. 296. On the other hand, Khun Sa's bid for supremacy in opium dealing had come to naught. He had lost his $500,000 investment; his army had been defeated and humiliated. His troopers began to quit him; by late 1968, more than half of his 2,000 man army had deserted. When he tried to ally himself with Shan insurgents, Burmese military intelligence clapped him in jail.McCoy, pp. 328, 331. However, when Khun Sa retired in 1971, he was still wealthy.Friesendorf, pp. 50‚Äì53. With his initial huge haul of confiscated opium, and his newly won control of opium traffic into Laos, General Ouane improved his refineries. At the time of the 1967 Opium War, they were turning out morphine base; some of that was further refined into crude but smokeable Number 3 Globe heroin. Within two years of the war, highly refined injectable Number 4 Globe heroin was being produced. Ouane's product now spread beyond its prior Asian market, to be smuggled into and sold in the United States and Europe. Not least among his markets was disaffected American troops in Vietnam.

Bausch√§nzli (diminutive of \\"construction entrenchment\\") is one of the last remains of the Baroque fortifications of Z√ºrich which began in 1642. The neighboring Schanzengraben (moat) and the Old Botanical Garden are part of these remains. Since 1907, the island has been used as a restaurant, although it is officially a public square and park.  Geography  Bausch√§nzli is situated in the historical Alpenquai district on the artificial island.

The area between Limmat and Lake Zurich around Sechsel√§utzenplatz and on the small islands and peninsulas in Z√ºrichwas was once swampland. Prehistoric pile dwellings around Z√ºrichsee were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona. Alpenquai is located on the Lake Zurich shore in Enge, a locality of the municipality of Z√ºrich. It was neighbored by the settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner, on what was then a peninsula (now an island) in the effluence of the Limmat. It was an area of about within the city of Z√ºrich. As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, the settlements are listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class object. Despite the dredging for the construction of the Seequai between 1916 and 1919, an area of approximately with two cultural layers was preserved around Bausch√§nzli. Pile shoes at different altitudes in the cultural layers were found and rich bar decoration of ceramics occurred exclusively in the lower layer. The decoration on the cannelure groups was limited to the upper layer, with some graphite- decorated fragments.Keltisches Geld in Z√ºrich: Der spektakul√§re ¬´Potinklumpen¬ª.

Grendeltor  Grendeltor by Hans Leu at the end of the 15th century AD Grendeltor (or colloquially Grendel) was the only water gate in medieval Z√ºrich. It served as an additional lakeside fortification towards the present Stadelhoferplatz. The gate served as a transit for vessel traffic between the Limmat and Lake Zurich. It was the only water gate in Z√ºrich and stood on the east bank of the Limmat where Haus Bellevue is today, opposite the Bausch√§nzli bastion. It was enforced by a double row of palisades. In an assignment list of about 1489 AD, two riflemen, \\"uff the hutten\\", were mentioned, probably meaning the Grendeltor. The gate tower was also built as a customs station for goods that were transported on the waterway to the civilian Schiffl√§nde harbor. The medieval military harbor was situated at the present Sechsel√§utenplatz. In 1578, 'the alert to the buzz uff the huts' had to be guaranteed at day and night. The Grendeltor was broken in the mid-19th century.  Modern history  Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) landing gate probably in the 1850s Limmatquai and Quaianlagen: Bellevueplatz and B√ºrkliplatz, Quaibr√ºcke, M√ºnsterbr√ºcke and M√ºnsterhof, and Rathausbr√ºcke‚ÄìWeinplatz, aerial photography by Eduard Spelterini probably in the mid-1890s. The name Bausch√§nzli derives from the former building site Bauplatz Schanz, meaning \\"construction site at the Lair\\" or, literally, bastion. Later, it was popularly called Sch√§nzlein im Wasser, situated in the historical Kratz quarter. It was built as a bulwark. A picket fence was built in the south on what was the shore of Lake Zurich, between 1657 and 1662 AD. Today, Bausch√§nzli is reached from the west bank of the Limmat, at that time the site of the Bauhaus of the city's engineer, by a web-scraped drawbridge. As a southerly outpost, it served as a bastion to protect the city against naval attacks. On a shoal in the Limmat funnel, a small hill was built in 1660 to block access from the lake to the city. It was called Halbmond meaning \\"half moon\\", and was planted with trees. However, it was never threatened in the following years, and thus it was used primarily for public events. The Schwirren, lakeside palisades, were demolished in 1834/35 and its wall fortification in 1842. While the fortifications were abolished, the Bausch√§nzli bastion remained intact and served from 1835 to 1883 as the landing site for the first steamboats on the lake, later provided by the Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG). For some years, it was the property of the Canton of Z√ºrich but was sold back to the city in 1846, under the condition that it must remain open to the public as a public square. The Leutholdplan map of 1846 showed it as a public park with tall trees and huge pillars in its center. In 1907, the owner of the Metropol building at Stadthausquai was allowed to run a garden restaurant and a building was erected for the Biergarten and to house an electric lighting facility. The current economic building and the distinctive column-like poplar were erected in 1937. In 2001/2002, in addition to the renovation and expansion of the Herter-building, new trees were planted and replenished, and the urban Plan Lumi√®re was implemented.

He served as President of Lehigh University from 1946 until his death in 1960.  Early life and education  Martin Dewey Whitaker was born in Ellenboro, North Carolina, on June 29, 1902, the son of Volney Oscar Whitaker and Florence O. Bridges. He graduated from Boiling Springs High School, later to become Gardner-Webb University, in 1922.http://library.digitalnc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/yearbooks/id/3034/rec/11 He earned a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree from Wake Forest College in 1927. He worked as an instructor at the University of North Carolina from 1928 to 1930, earning a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in physics. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from New York University in 1935, writing his thesis on the \\"Absorption and scattering of neutrons\\".  Career  Whitaker was acting chairman of the department of physics at New York University until 1942, when he joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago during World War II. In September 1942, Arthur Compton asked him to form the nucleus of an operating staff for the X-10 Graphite Reactor that was to be constructed on Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Whitaker became the first director of the Clinton Laboratories, which later became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The first permanent operating staff arrived at X-10 from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1944, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site. They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Manhattan District's Special Engineer Detachment. By March 1944, there were some 1,500 people working at X-10. After the war's end, Whitaker left Oak Ridge to take up the post of President of Lehigh University on June 1, 1946. His term as president saw the Lehigh University in a period of great growth and expansion. Its assets nearly tripled, its endowment more than doubled to $18 million, and the number of professors increased by 75 percent. Two new halls of residence, Dravo House and McClintic-Marshall House were built, while many other buildings were renovated. In 1959 he initiated the Centennial development program, which raised over $22 million for faculty salaries and construction that included the University Center, and the Whitaker Laboratory, which would be named in his honor in 1966. He died of lung cancer in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on August 31, 1960. He was survived by his wife, the former Helen Williams, and their two daughters, Margaret and Catherine.

Geography  The bath is situated at Mythenquai respectively between the Enge and Wollishofen quarters at lower the Z√ºrichsee lake shore on the left bank in Z√ºrich. Public transport is provided by the VBZ transport company by the tram line 7 (stop Brunaustrasse), the bus lines 161 and 165 to Sukkulentensammlung stop, and the Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft tour boats towards Seerestaurant, as well as by the ZVV S-Bahn line S8 towards Wollishofen train station.  History and description  As the old bathhouse had to make place for the construction of the so-called Seeuferanlage promenade, the then independent municipality of Riesbach built two new bathing facilities ‚Äì Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen (1886) at Z√ºrichhorn and Seebad Utoquai (1890) at Utoquai ‚Äì on the other bank of the Z√ºrichsee lake shore. Opened in spring 1922, the Mythenquai lido was visited by up to 11,000 visitors a day, then gender separated by wall boards that were broken a few years later. A water slide was installed in 1927 in the still present family-oriented lido. During the World War II, grains and vegetables were planted in the spacious area. In 1951 a fire destroyed the bathroom so far that the city of Z√ºrich decided to build a new one. As in the early years, the sandy beach is still very popular and a unique feature in the Z√ºrich baths. In 1976 the restaurant building complex was added. An architectural competition in 2011 for a new concept failed. In the 2014 season, the Mythenquai lido was rebuilt for about CHF 7.5 million, and the popular grass strip on the sandy beach gave way to a more spacious sandy surface, but it also was replaced by a concrete construction. Two old trees were felled, 25 new trees were planted. The big, yellow umbrellas ‚Äì the landmark of the Seebadi since 1976 ‚Äì were removed. The restaurant was replaced by a new construction on the edge of the bath, and was designed as a 1950s style pavilion, also housing vegetarian menues.  Cultural heritage  The garden area is open to the public in the Winter season. The structure is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as an object of regional importance.

Nandaka (literally \\"source of joy\\") or Nandaki is the sword of the Hindu god Vishnu. Even though some scriptures recommend the sword to be depicted in Vishnu's hand, it is generally not depicted in the iconography of Vishnu (who is generally depicted four-armed) and makes a later appearance in the god's sculptures. Nandaka is generally depicted in images where Vishnu is represented with more than four arms. The sword is compared to knowledge in Hindu scriptures. The Vaishnav (Vishnu-worshipping sect) saints Annamacharya and Pey Azhwar are considered the avatars of Nandaka. Iconography and development Nandaka personified as a youth with a sword. Vishnu is usually depicted as four-armed with the four attributes in his hands: the shankha (conch), the Sudarshana chakra, the padma (lotus) and the Kaumodaki gada (mace). In eight or sixteen armed depictions of the deity, he may be shown holding a sword. The sword appears very rarely in the depictions of Vishnu. It appears in Vishnu iconography as late as the Gupta era (320‚Äì550 CE). While Hindu scriptures narrate elaborate tales about how Vishnu gained his other weapons, none are told about the sword, apart from an allusion to the sword of Vishnu's avatar Rama in the Hindu epic Ramayana. The Harivamsa as well as the Brihatbrahma Samhita prescribe the sword to be shown in Vishnu's four-armed images. The Sattvata Samhita recommends it to be shown in a right hand of a six-armed Vishnu and in a left-hand in a ten-armed Vishnu.Desai pp. 14-6 Vishnu' avatar Vamana is described to hold the Nandaka in his right hand in the Kalika Purana, but no such sculpture is found. An 11th-century image shows the sword tied to his belt.Desai pp. 102-3 The Vishnu sahasranama, which enlists 1000 epithets of Vishnu, mentions Nandaka twice. In a mantra, Vishnu is praised as the holder of the shankha, Nandaka and chakra. The 994th name of Vishnu is \\"Nandaki\\", one who wields the Nandaka. In a rare depiction in the Sheshashayi Vishnu panel of the Gupta Deogarh temple, Nandaka is depicted anthropomorphically as a young man holding a sword (See Ayudhapurusha). He is depicted leading the other personified weapons of Vishnu against the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. Nandaka is also depicted as an ayudhapurusha in the scene of Madhu and Kaitabha in the Mahishasuramardini mandapa, Mahabalipuram. Symbolism The Vishnu Purana says that Nandaka, \\"the pure sword\\" represents jnana (knowledge), which is created from vidya (translated variously as wisdom, knowledge, science, learning, scholarship, philosophy), its sheath is avidya (ignorance or illusion). The Varaha Purana describes it as the destroyer of ignorance. The Krishna Upanishad as well as Swami Karpatri (1907‚Äì1982) in his Shri Vishnu Tattva equate the sword to the god Shiva. The former says that the Great God (Maheshvara, an epithet of Shiva) takes form of a flaming sword of knowledge, that destroys ignorance. Karpatri also associates Vishnu's sword with Akasha (ether). He says that Nandaka's sheath is darkness, who is also an aspect of God.

On 27 July episode of Raw, Murphy and Rollins injured Black's right eye by driving it through the steel steps. Murphy and Rollins continued feuding with Mysterio which also saw the involvement of Mysterio's son Dominik Mysterio. At Payback, Rollins and Murphy were defeated Rey and Dominik after Murphy accidentally kicked Rollins costing them the match. This would cause tension between Rollins and Murphy as Rollins began berating Murphy telling him to stay backstage and not get involved in his matches. However, on 14 September episode of Raw, after Murphy interfered during a Steel Cage match between Dominik and Rollins and accidentally slammed the door against Rollins, Rollins would viciously attack Murphy. Murphy would then begin a storyline with Mysterio's daughter Aalyah after he apologised to her for Rollins' actions towards her family leading her to believe that Murphy is not as bad as Rollins. On 5 October episode of Raw, Murphy attacked Rollins after he refused to apologise to him, thus appearing to turn face for the first time in his WWE career.

Described in 1826, it contains fifteen genera and about eighty species. It has been variously treated as a subfamily or tribe. It is native to the Southern United States, Central and South America, predominantly Chile. Of the three tribes of genera that make up the subfamily Allioideae, Gilliesieae is the largest and most variable. The tribe was divided into two tribes in 2014, Gilliesiae s.s. and Leucocoryneae, based on differences in floral symmetry and septal nectaries.  Description  Gilliesieae are perennial herbaceous geophytes characterised by simple or prolific bulbs, sometimes with lateral rhizomes. Leaf sheaths long, tepals more or less fused and corona absent. Spathe formed from 1‚Äì2 bracts. Style more or less gynobasic. Ovary usually has two ovules per locule, side by side. There are 2‚Äì3 stamens. The commonest chromosome number is x=4. Gilliesiae is distinguished from Leucocoryneae by zygomorphic floral symmetry and the absence of septal nectaries. By contrast Leucocoryneae are zygomorphic and have septal nectaries.  Leucocorynae  Leucocoryneae are terrestrial perennial herbaceous plants. They have tunicate bulbs, which may be simple or prolific (with bulbils), rarely lateral rhizomes. The outer bulb scales (cataphyll) are papyraceous, colourless or violaceous (Zoellnerallium). They may or may not have a garlic like odour. The leaves are large, with membranous sheaths, usually forming an underground neck. The leaf lamina is flat, green, and glaucous, glabrous or papillose. The inflorescence may be pauciflor (Ipheion, Beauverdia, rarely Tristagma) or pluriflor (up to 30). The spathe is formed by a single bifid membranous bract (Ipheion) or from two papyraceous bracts partially fused at the base. The pedicels, which are not articulated at the receptacles, are papilose or glabrous. The flowers are hermaphroditic and actinomorphic, the perianth corolla like, with 6 (8 in Beauverdia) tepals fused at their base to form a floral tube arising around the ovary. There are 6 stamens (8 in Beauverdia), 3 fertile and 3 not (staminodes), rarely 6 (Leucocoryne), in two whorls of three (Tristagma, Ipheion) or one whorl. The filaments which are adnate (fused) to the tepals, uniting at their bases, the anthers dorsifixed (attached at their back) are oblong, yellow brown or green. The ovaries are superior and sessile with three (four in Beauverdia) carpels and locules (four in Beauverdia) and septal nectaries. The number of ovules is either 2, 4 or 30 per locule, arranged in two rows. The style is apical and persistent. The stigma has three (four in Beauverdia) lobes, or is trifid, and is papillose. The capsule, which is humifuse (Ipheion, Beauverdia) or aerocarpic, globose or prismatic, and contains many seeds (pluriseeded) which are irregular and polyhedral with a black tegmen. The embryo is linear or slightly curved.  Taxonomy   History  Lindley described Gilliesia in 1826, after fellow botanist John Gillies, placing this genus and another Chilean genus Miersia which he described at the same time, in a new taxon, Gilliesieae. These and related genera have been variously assigned to families Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Alliaceae and even Gilliesiaceae over their history, often as tribe Gilliesieae Lindl. In 1985, Dahlgren's treatment of the Alliaceae (now Allioideae) within the monocotyledons, recognised three subfamilies. Gilliesioideae (Lindl.) Am., together with Agapanthoideae and Allioideae. These corresponded to Hutchinson's (1959) three tribes within his expanded Amaryllidaceae (Agapantheae, Allieae, and Gilesieae). The Gilliesioideae contained nine genera endemic to the southern part of South America, predominantly Chile.  Phylogenetic era (subfamily Gilliesioideae) 1996  In 1996, a molecular phylogenetic study of the rbcL gene showed Gilliesia and related genera clustering in a separate clade at subfamilial level. The authors rejected the proposal of Traub (1982) of a separate family, Gilliesiaceae (later resurrected by Ravenna), but rather created the Gilliesioideae, as one of three subfamilies within Alliaceae, together with Allioideae and Tulbaghioideae. As phylogenetically constructed, Gilliesioideae (Gilliesioideae (Lindl.) Am., Botany: 134. 1832 - Gilliesieae Lindl. in Bot. Reg.: ad t. 992. 1826. - Type: Gilliesia Lindl.) consisted of those New World Alliaceae not included in the other two subfamilies, which included both the former Gilliesieae (Ancrumia, Erinna, Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Solaria and Trichlora) together with Ipheion, Leucocoryne, Nothoscordum, and Tristagma. Garaventia and Steinmannia were not included in the study, but considered to be part of this newly reconstructed subfamily, a total of 13 genera. This is the circumscription which the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) accepted in the APG classification of 1998 and which later became known as Alliaceae sensu stricto (s.s.). In the 2003 update (APGII) it was proposed to include Agapanthaceae and Amaryllidaceae under Alliaceae, while recognising an argument for renaming the overarching family from Alliaceae to Amaryllidaceae. This construction of Gilliesioideae, which represented nearly all the Alliaceae genera (i.e. except Allium and Tulbaghia), implicitly recognised that it was composed of two groups or tribes, informally referred to as Ipheieae and Gilliesieae. The Ipheieae were actinomorphic, and included Ipheion, Nothoscordum, Leucocoryne s.l. (including Pabellonia and Stemmatium). Gilliesieae were rare, mostly zygomorphic, mostly endemic to Chile and typified by Gilliesa. It contained about eight genera (Ancrumia, Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Schickendantziella, Solaria and Trichlora). The genera of Gilliesioideae were thus morphologically and genetically diverse, which has made generic delimitation problematic and many species have at times been included in various different genera, and a number of genera have been shown to be polyphyletic. Consequently, the number of genera included tends to be variable A more detailed analysis using multiple markers (Fay et al. 2006) confirmed the monophyly of Gilliesioideae as a whole, as were the two tribes, although some genera such as Ipheion and Nothoscordum were biphyletic. In general the Gilliesieae, with their unusual floral morphology, have genera that are closely related. For instance Ancrumia, Gethyum and Solaria have been treated as three, two or one (Solaria) genus by different authors. (see Genera and notes)  APG III familial realignment (tribe Gilliesieae) 2009  In 2009, Chase et al. more formally brought together the three families, Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, under the single Asparagalean monophyletic family, now renamed Amaryllidaceae from Alliaceae, reversing the Dahlgrenian process of family splitting. This necessitated reducing the existing ranks of the component subfamilial taxa. This formed the basis for the 2009 APG classification (APGIII). Thus subfamily Gilliesioideae became tribe Gilliesieae (Baker, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 14: 509. 24 Apr 1875) within subfamily Allioideae of family Amaryllidaceae. Within the tribe they included thirteen genera including Leucocoryne s.l. (see Genera). The full taxonomy of tribe Gilliesieae remains unresolved. Of the South America genera, a number have common features (tunicate bulbs, inflorescences with unarticulated pedicels, and one or two bracts subtending the inflorescence). These are Ipheion Raf., Leucocoryne Lindl., Nothoscordum Kunth, Tristagma Poepp., and Zoellnerallium Crosa. The position of Ipheion is particularly problematic.  Division of Ipheion (resurrection of Beauverdia)  In 1972, Ipheion was divided into two sections, Hirtellum and Ipheion. However, the development of phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ipheion was not monophyletic, although the division into sections was later supported. Beauverdia Herter had been first described in 1943. Originally it was created to distinguish those species with unifloral inflorescences from others with plurifloral inflorescences within Nothoscordum and other genera, no longer considered Amaryllidaceae. As proposed it had ten species but its independence was short lived, being returned to a synonym of Ipheion, and a number of species were transferred to other genera, including Nothoscordum and Tristagma. In 2014, Ipheion section Hirtellum was again raised to genus rank and restored to the tribe, being distinguished from other Ipheion species, under the older name of Beauverdia, with four species found in Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay.  Division of Gilliesieae and resurrection of Leucocoryneae  In 2014 Sassone also proposed resurrecting an older taxon, Leucocorynae to include six genera, Beauverdia (4 species), Ipheion s.s. (3 species), Leucocoryne s.l. (15 species), Nothoscordum (c. 20 species), Tristagma (c. 20 species) and Zoellnerallium (2 species). Leucocorynae had originally been described by Ravenna in 2001 as a tribe of Gilliesioideae, to include Leucocoryne together with Tulbaghia (now in separate tribe, Tulbaghieae) on morphological grounds, but it was not adopted. Instead, as described by Rudall et al. (2002) and Fay et al. (2006) there was a general recognition, as described above of two tribes, Ipheieae nom. nud. (4 genera) and Gilliesieae (7 genera) differing by actinomorphic floral symmetry and the presence of septal nectaries in the former. Subsequently Zoellnerallium was added to the Ipheieae, even though with the reduction of Gilliesioideae to the tribe Gilliesieae, the older divisions could no longer be recognised, at least as tribes (possibly subtribes). This now formally divides tribe Gilliesieae s.l. into two tribes, Gilliesieae s.s. (8 genera) and Leucocoryneae (6 genera). This new tribe corresponds to the older Ipheieae, together with the two more recent additions of Beauverdia and Zoellnerallium and includes about 65 species, although this could be closer to 130, according to Ravenna's proposals for Nothoscordum which would increase its species from 20 to about 60. The taxonomy of Gilliesieae s.s. remains difficult with limited sampling, because of the problem of obtaining material from these little-known plants. Hence the different treatment of a number of the genera by different authors.

The first Orthodox congregation to organize in Birmingham in 1889, the synagogue is currently located at 3100 Overton Road, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Eytan Yammer, a graduate of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah served as rabbi from 2010 through 2016 and was named by The Forward as one of its 33 most inspiring American rabbis in 2015. History After incorporating in 1889,Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.8 the first building for the congregation was constructed in 1903 at cost of $15,000 on the southwest corner of 17th Street North and 7th Avenue North,Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p. 15 Birmingham at the heart of what was then a Jewish neighborhood populated by immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe. In 1955 the congregation moved to a then-remote site at 3225 Montevallo Road in what is now Mountain Brook.Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.46 A pillar erected in the yard of the $200,000 synagogue on Montevallo Road (which was considered incomplete, with further plans for a 1200-1500 seat sanctuary)Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.49 was intended to serve as the cornerstone of a more permanent building. A second phase, adding a social and recreational wing, was undertaken in 1969.Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.61 In May, 1984, then Rabbi Harry (Tzvi) Rosen (who went on to edit Kashrus Kurrents for the Star-K) discovered that one of the torahs had been stolen from the synagogue. While talking with local police about the theft, he received a phone call asking for ransom money to return the torah scroll, at which point the police called in the FBI. While the investigation was ongoing, early the following month the Rabbi received another phone call indicating that the missing torah had been found in a Salvation Army donation bin.Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.64-65 Knesseth Israel, facing deteriorating conditions in their synagogue, began moving forward with plans for a new building in 2003,Bonfield, Knesseth Israel p.155 taking up the suggestion of relocating to the site of the former Our Savior Evangelical Lutheran Church on Overton Road. The congregation hoped to take advantage of the high value of the Montevallo Road property, which faces the Birmingham Country Club golf course, to help finance the move, which brought them within a few blocks of the Bais Ariel Chabad Center and strengthening ties within Birmingham's Orthodox Jewish community. The congregation voted in December 2005 to make the move and raised $5.4 million in donations. Of the nearly 100 families in Knesseth Israel at the time, many walked to Sabbath services so the decision required them to find new homes in the Overton neighborhood straddling Mountain Brook and Cahaba Heights. Stained-glass window of Knesseth Israel Congregation, Birmingham, AL by Andrea Lucas The new 18,000 square-foot brick building was completed in Fall 2007. On November 11, 2007 the congregation held a celebratory procession to the new building, carrying the congregation's six Torah scrolls. The new facility includes a sanctuary, a smaller chapel, a mikvah for ritual immersion, an outdoor permanent Sukkah structure, offices, classrooms, library, social hall, playground, and two separate kitchens for the preparation of kosher meals. It also features a 50 square foot rose style stained glass window designed and fabricated by local artist Andrea Lucas. Across the street a new house was also built for the KI rabbi. However, in July 2012 the congregation, faced with debts arising from a disappointing return on their former property (which was only sold after the nationwide collapse of the real estate market during the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08), put the new Overton Road building up for sale. Birmingham Jewish Federation president Jimmy Filler contacted prominent community members Fred and Brenda Friedman about the possibility of helping the congregation remain in place by purchasing the building. The result was the establishment of the Fred and Brenda Friedman Center for Jewish Life which hosts events and programs for several Jewish organizations while also providing a permanent home for Knesseth Israel. Services and programs In February 2012, an eruv covering two square miles of Mountain Brook and Cahaba Heights was erected by Rabbi Yammer (with the Halachic guidance of Rabbi Yaakov Love). As of January 2015, the congregation has a daily morning Shacharit service in combination with the Chabad Center (Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays at Chabad; Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at KI), regular Shabbat and Holiday services followed by a full kiddush lunch, and Friday night Kabbalat Shabbat services weekly. There is also an education program for young children held on Sunday mornings and multiple weekly adult learning programs.

The authors stated that they were unable to obtain more information on the Consolidated Benevolent Association and the Kuomintang, and therefore the book has more information on the newer Chinese associations compared to the CBA and KMT. Chapters The book is organized in a chronological manner. The first portion is an opening chapter. Part 1, covering chapters 2-5, was written by Willmott. He discusses the beginning of the Chinese community in Canada and discrimination against the Chinese, spanning the years 1858-1911. Part 2 and Part 3 each have four chapters. The former discusses 1911-1923 and the latter discusses the post-immigration exclusion Chinese community. Wickberg wrote chapters 6-14. Part 4, spanning 5 chapters, discusses the post-World War II Chinese community. Graham Johnson wrote the four chapters after Wickberg's. Reference material There are around 50 pages of tables.

History The Loerie Awards first took place in 1978 in Johannesburg. Television was introduced to South Africa relatively late in 1976, and the delay was due to the political belief at the time that television was \\"undesirable\\". Once television had finally been introduced, the first television commercials commenced in 1978, and consequently, the Loerie Awards were introduced in the same year to promote the new medium of television advertising. Since 1978, new categories were regularly added and today the awards include not only traditional advertising, but recognise virtually every touch-point between a brand and the consumer - including architecture, design, digital media, live events, sponsorship, as well as integrated campaigns. In 2004, the Loeries were almost \\"consigned to the scrap heap.\\" Until then, the awards were managed by the Marketing Federation of South Africa, but they were rescued by the Association for Communication and Advertising (ACA) South Africa and the Creative Circle South Africahttp://www.fmcg.co.za/default.aspx?tabid=226 who formed a new non-profit company to run the awards. After the inaugural awards in Johannesburg in 1978, the awards were held for many years at Sun City until 2004. In 2005 the Loeries moved to Margate, KwaZulu-Natal, then to Cape Town in 2009, and in 2015 the awards will be hosted for the first time in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. Dr Andrew Human has been the Chief Executive Officer since 2005 and Suhana Gordhan is the current Chairpersonhttp://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/614/149632.html. Creative Week It has been estimated that Loeries Creative Week is worth ZAR100 million (approximately US$10 million). Creative Week is a week long festival that begins with the judging of all the work. Over 160 judges from across the region as well as international jury chairmen assess the work. Finalists are announced every day and judging is concluded with a recently introduced \\"Seminar of Creativity.\\" The winning work is announced on the Saturday and Sunday evenings at the end of the week.

Early references about it are contradictory, both in its geographical location and in description.

However Fletcher sees this as a myth. He further writes that in Obdoria, near the mouth of Ob River there is a rock of shape resembling a ragged woman bearing a child in her hands, and Obdorian Samoyeds use it in their pagan sorcery.Russia at the Close of the Sixteenth Century, Comprising the Treatise \\"Of the Russe Common Wealth\\" (Google eBook) p.99 The Golden Woman appears as Zolotaia baba on the 1569 map of the world by Gerardus Mercator.

It's one of the holy place \\"Tevaram has been sung on the primary god of the Shiva (Paadal Petra sthalam)\\". From north side Chidambaram to The Mahendra Mountain totally 63 Shiva temples have been presented. It's also one of the part of 63 Shiva's holy places. Once upon a time ponsei ruled under Chola dynasty  Etymology  The First rajendra chola has created a town Gangaikonda cholapuram with most beautiful and rare sculptural techniques. It's similar to earlier creation of Rajaraja emperor's Thanjai Brihadeeswarar Temple. The Chola conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and Srivijaya, and their continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire, enabled them to influence the local cultures. So that Emperor Rajendra chola also called \\"Poorva Desamum Vendra Kopparakesari Varman \\"was awarded a special title. So this place named Kadarankondan, Later name has to convert into Kidarankondan.  Other reasons  There is a significant correlation between Thirugnanasambandar and nanipalli. His mother Bhagwati was born in this place. Thirugnasamabandar has sung a song to lord Shiva. Then this place has to change Parched wasteland to Seashore land, then he converted into Agricultural Land. So that Thirunanaipalli called Ponsei. After this incident sambandar called his named ThiruGnana Sambanthar.  Features  * Cauvery River, though flows eastward turns here westward.

History The base was established on Dong Toan Mountain east of Highway 9 overlooking the site of the former Vandegrift Combat Base. 1971 The 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, part of the 101st Airborne Division, occupied Sarge during 1971. On 30 March 1971 Hughes OH-6A Cayuse #67-16433 crashed near the landing pad at Sarge killing an artillery observer. Following the loss of Hill 950 in June 1971, the Army Security Agency (ASA) searched for a replacement site for its Explorer III signals interception system and Sarge and Con Thien were selected, with the units installed by December 1971. The top-secret Explorer equipment was contained in purpose-built bunkers constructed by the 27th Combat Engineer Battalion and operated by U.S. Army technicians from the 407th Radio Research Detachment, Detachment A, 8th Radio Research Field Station (8th RRFS). 1972 By January 1972 the ARVN 3rd Division had assumed responsibility for the area north of Highway 9. Sarge was occupied by the 4th Vietnamese Marine Corps Battalion (4th VNMC). During March 1972, then Major Walter E. Boomer, adviser to the 4th VNMC reported to the 3rd Division headquarters that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) appeared to be building up their forces west of Sarge and the 8th RRFS reported that the PAVN had established an artillery headquarters 6km southwest of Sarge. The PAVN launched their Easter Offensive on 30 March 1972 and PAVN artillery fire killed 15 Vietnamese Marines at Sarge that day. A direct hit of the 8th RRFS bunker ignited Thermite demolition charges, incinerating the two U.S. Army operators inside. The artillery fire was followed by a ground attack by the PAVN 66th Regiment which by 2am on 1 April had succeeded in penetrating the base's defense perimeter. At 03:45 Major Boomer and the 4th VNMC command group abandoned the base and escaped through PAVN lines into the surrounding jungle. By 2 April Major Boomer and 8 Vietnamese Marines had made it to the relative safety of Mai Loc Camp. 4th VNMC losses were 347 out of an initial strength of 632 Marines.

Debuting in 1969, the conference's keynote speaker was Austrian economist Prof. Ludwig von Mises. Future of Freedom conference 1969 The Future of Freedom Conference 1969-1990 The Ludwig von Mises Conference (1969) Ludwig von Mises More than 200 students attended the Ludwig von Mises Conference that was held at Long Beach State University, now known as California State University, Long Beach, in May 1969, in response to Young Americans for Freedom's (YAF) purges of libertarian leaders just before the infamous national YAF St. Louis convention in August 1969. In early March 1969, Dana Rohrabacher and Shawn Steel, co-chairs of California YAF, were removed by National YAF. Many purged leaders, and county chairs would eventually organize a new student organization called the California Libertarian Alliance (CLA). One of their first endeavors was to hold a gathering of libertarian leaders, writers and economists. The idea to have some type of gathering evolved into a full- fledged conference at a college. The conference was initially planned and organized under the leadership of Dana Rohrabacher, who was the main founder and chairman of the Libertarian Caucus of YAF from 1966 to 69. Dana Rohrabacher, known as the \\"Johnny Grass-seed\\" of radical YAFers, later became a journalist, a speechwriter for President Reagan, and a U.S. Congressman in Southern California. Other purged YAF members involved in the 1969 conference included the following: Gene Berkman, draft resister, later to become owner of Renaissance Books in Riverside, CA; Bill \\"Shawn\\" Steel, USC student and statewide chairman of Youth for Reagan, later to become an attorney, a founder of the California Libertarian Party, and chairman of the California Republican Party; Ron Kimberling, later Dr. Ron Kimberling, radio show commentator who became executive director of the Ronald Reagan Foundation and Assistant Secretary for Higher Education in the last years of the Reagan administration; Dennis Turner, writer for Reason magazine and computer programmer; John Schurman, psychology major and staff worker for Rampart College. In 1981 Shawn Steel commented about the reasons for the first conference, writing that \\"Freedom oriented people found themselves abandoned, either purged from the right or the left. Because of this political turmoil, we invited decentralists, individualists and voluntaryists in one forum to organize, discuss and study the philosophy we now call 'libertarianism.'\\" Other speakers at 1969's Ludwig von Mises Conference included the following: R. C. Hoiles, longtime publisher of The Register (now known as the Orange County Register) in Santa Ana, CA; Robert LeFevre, Rampart College founder and author; Skye D'Aureous (Durk Pearson), MIT graduate with a triple major in physics, biology, and psychology; John Hospers, USC philosophy professor. Gary North, a conservative writer for the Christian newsletter Chalcedon Report, was horrified by what he saw at the conference. He accused the participants of \\"secular libertarianism\\" which he believed to be suicidal, especially the sinfulness of those who take illegal drugs.

Mr. Peron, the principal organizer of the event says it was not associated with Future of Freedom other than as a sponsor, along with Advocates for Self-Government and the ISIL conference. It was billed as the World Freedom Conference. Peron says, \\"As principal organizer with Vince's help, I planned the event. While ISIL, FofF and Advocates were asked to help promote the event they had no actual stake in the event.\\" There was a Future of Freedom conference at Fort Mason, San Francisco one year earlier, however, which is not mentioned above. ISIL was formed in 1989 by the merger of the Society for Individual Liberty, founded in 1969 by Jarret Wollstein, Dave Walter and Don Ernsberger, and Libertarian International, co-founded by Vince Miller in 1980.

It is usually applied as a percentage of operational (running) costs. It has been used by the Australian Government on Australian Public Service departments and agencies since 1987. Some departments and agencies have been exempted.  History  A 1.25% efficiency dividend was introduced by the Bob Hawke Government in 1987-88. It was reduced to 1% from 1994-95 to 2004-2005 then increased to 1.25% from 2005-06. For 2008-09 a one-off 2% efficiency dividend on top of the ongoing efficiency dividend was applied. In 2011-12 it was 1.5% and in 2012-13 another extra one-off 2.5% was applied.  Controversy  Proponents of the efficiency dividend argue that it improves the cost effectiveness of the public sector, allows managerial flexibility in the allocation of resources, and is a good way to generate savings in the cost of public sector administration. Critics have described the efficiency dividend as a blunt instrument, a false economy, and lazy budgeting. Smaller agencies have also highlighted the difficulty in finding such savings.

Early life and education Smith was born in Newcastle, Wyoming into a politically active family. Smith's parents were Peter and Helen (Jensen) Smith. He was born while his grandfather was governor of Wyoming and both he and his sister Connie Smith were christened at the governor's mansion. Connie Smith disappeared in 1952 at age 10 while attending summer camp in Connecticut, and was never found. The case is unsolved. Smith attended the University of Wyoming from which he graduated with bachelor's degree in 1961. Subsequently, he purchased several ranches in Sundance, Wyoming and managed the operations himself. Political career Smith began his political career in 1962 when he won the Crook County seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives. During his time in the legislature, Smith, a Republican, sponsored several notable bills including the first strip mine reclamation law in the West. Smith also worked on several populist causes including authoring a state constitutional amendment which prohibited the implementation of a state income tax and championing a sales tax rebate for the elderly and disabled. In 1975, Smith was chosen by his party to chair the Legislative Management Council, a position he held until 1978. Smith also served as the Majority Floor Leader and Speaker Pro Tem. In 1977, during his eighth and final term in office, Smith was given the position of Speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives. After leaving the state legislature, Smith continued to run his ranches and stayed heavily involved in Wyoming politics. As president of the Wyoming Taxpayers Association, he worked for the formation of a state Budget Adjustment Account. In 1982, Smith mounted a campaign for the governor's office. He led the polls leading up to the primary, but had quit the race citing on-going health issues. In 1983, Smith became Wyoming's Public Service Commissioner. He was an active member of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. He continued to serve on the state Public Service Commission until 1991.

Pratibandhaka is a causal dependency and refers to something that must perform the specific function of obstructing. Jaina concept of causal power Prabhachandra, the disciple of Akalarika, endorses the Jaina argument that the causal complex has the causal power of producing effect owing to the existence of some extra-sensory power ( shakti ), that the hindrance in the origination of an effect is caused by counter-agents (pratibandhaka) is due to the special power. The followers of Jainism believe that the universe is full of karmic molecules whose mundane inflow towards the soul is caused by its own vibratory activities through mind, speech and body. Karma is the invisible power that explains causality, and the matter that binds the soul as a result of actions. But the notion of some power connected with causation is rejected by the Nyaya school which school concludes that a cognitive state is perceptible only when all causal conditions are present, abhava is perceived only in constructive cognitive state. The Mimamsakas hold the view the power connected with causation can be destroyed by the presence of an antidote (pratibandhaka) and can be resuscitated by an antidote to the antidote. Pervasion as ground for inference and Pratibandhaka Pervasion (vyapti) is the logical ground for inference which is a valid means of knowledge, and guarantees the truth of conclusion. It is the unconditional and constant concomitant relationship between the pervaded and the pervade. Any person desiring emancipation (a mumuksu) cannot gain liberation (moksha) without surmounting the obstacles (pratibandhakas) related to the connection with the body in the form of powerful and wicked actions or sinful deeds (pƒÅpa). The physical body (prak·πõti), by itself, is an obstacle to the union with the Supreme Being for it has within it imprisoned the self (ƒÅtman). Gangesa‚Äôs theory of pervasion and role of Pratibandhaka Gangesa, the author of TattvacintƒÅma·πái who had examined the possibility of dialectical reasoning as a way to grasp pervasion, in the anumƒÅna-khanda of the same text states that pervasion is pursued so long as there is doubt because there is contradiction but does not require deviation; doubt is an invalid cognitive act and fallacious reasoning is the ground for contradiction, the nature of doubt and fallacious reasoning both being conceptual is not of determinate character . Thus, dialectical reasoning is blocking of the opposing view and continues so long as doubt persists. Gangesa agrees that since pervasion is a universal invariant concomitance, therefore, the possibility of a counter example cannot be ruled out, and concludes that contradiction as natural opposition cannot block an infinite regress, it is the doubter‚Äôs own behaviour proving the lie to the doubt that blocks it acting as the pratibandhaka. Gangesa uses the term, pratibandhaka, to refer to a natural opposition in cognitive logic, as a preventer. Pervasion by its absence is the cause of hindrance (pratibandhaka) to inferential knowledge which in turn is the cause of pervasion. Even though both grasp their objects directly, in savikalpa its contents become objects of reflective awareness which is not the case in nirvikalpa. Contradiction occurs only when one epistemic state is blocked by a pratibandhaka. Gangesa has defined inferential knowledge as the cognition generated by cognition of a property belonging to a locus and qualified by a pervasion. A seed remaining intact does not sprout, and the destruction of the seed is a condition for the sprout to arise, the former is the obstacle (pratibandhaka) to sprout, and the latter indicates the absence of such obstacle. Vedic view of Pratibandhaka According to Advaita Vedanta, obstruction (pratibandhaka) of superimposition (adhyasa) is true knowledge, the absence of which obstruction is lack of true knowledge or ignorance (aj√±ƒÅna or avidyƒÅ). Pratibandhaka is that obstacle which prevents the production of an effect in causal conditions. According to the Nyaya school an effect is the counter-entity of its own prior non- existence and a fresh beginning. Swami Vidyaranya lists four such obstacles or impediments, which are:- :‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡•ã ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§É :‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§É |a) binding attachment to the objects of the senses, b) dullness of the intellect, c) indulgence in improper and illogical arguments and d) the deep conviction that the Self is an agent and an enjoyer (Panchadasi IX.43). He explains:- :‡§∂‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§É ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§£‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•à‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç :‡§®‡•Ä‡§§‡•á‡§Ω‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡•á‡§Ω‡§§‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§®‡•Å‡§§‡•á |that through the practice of inner control and other qualifications and through hearing the truth and so forth, suitable for counter-acting the impediments, the latter slowly perish, and one realizes his Self as Brahman (Panchadasi IX.44). The Yogi enters into the heaven of meritorious because of his practice of enquiry provided his enquiry is not impeded on account of the results of past evil deeds and his strong desire for Brahmaloka is not suppressed by him. In Ayurveda, the word pratibandhaka as vyƒÅdhyutpƒÅda pratibandhaka refers to the power of the body to resist disease which power (vyƒÅdhi virodhaka) when weakened can be restored by means of administering triphala fruits and the likes as an herbal rasayana.

Her paintings of birds, particularly the pigeons, were used in Coenraad Jacob Temminck's multi-part work Histoire Naturelle des Pigeons et des Gallinaces. She altered parts nine and later of this multipart work, retitling it to Les Pigeons by Madame Knip with Temminck only being author of the text. She however sent a copy to Temminck that was not tampered. She was the mother of Dutch artist Henri√´tte Ronner-Knip. Born in Paris, her father was a senior navy officer. She studied art under Jacques Barraband. She exhibited her watercolours and pen illustrations at the 1808, 1810, 1812 and 1814 salons. She met Joseph Knip, a student of Van Spaendonck, at Barraband's studio Illustration of the extinct Mauritius blue pigeon, from Les Pigeons (1811) The alterations to the title of the work have led to problems in taxonomy, how the authors are to be cited for species described in them and the dates of publication to be considered (especially when applying the principle of priority in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature). When the work was being prepared, Temminck lived in Holland and de Courcelles lived in Paris and was relied upon to supervise the engraving and printing. Madame de Courcelles was a friend of Marie Louise, husband of Napoleon Bonaparte and had royal patronage. Temminck discovered the alterations only after 1812 and found that he could not complain about the piracy because of her powerful friends. He however added a note on the matter at the end of the third and last volume of his 1815 work Histoire naturelle g√©n√©rale des pigeons et des gallinac√©s.

He attended City College of New York from 1954 to 1958. His grandfather, Mordecai Grunglaz (became Green in the United States), was driven out of Belarus in 1910 for his involvement in violent resistance to a pogrom that led to the death of a Cossack. This separated him from his family so that he missed the birth of his son, Irving Green, the father of Mark. The family was reunited in 1920 in Mineville, New York. He has a sister, Dorothy Lederman, and a brother, Stuart Green, who is founder and director of the New Jersey Coalition for Bullying Awareness and Prevention,Lawline, Faculty Information, Stuart Green a networking organization formed in 2000 in response to the bullying-related tragedy at Columbine.NY.com, Stuart Green, Overlook social worker honored by professional organization for anti-bullying advocacy Career After graduation in 1958 he worked as a technician for Pfizer Corporation in Brooklyn and then entered the United States Army for six months of active duty in Fort McClellan, Alabama, teaching aspects of chemical and biological warfare. After fulfilling his service requirements, he worked first for Perkin-Elmer Corporation in Norwalk, Connecticut, as a technical sales trainee and then for Olin Mathieson Corporation in Hartford, Connecticut, as a technician. After graduate studies at night at the Saint Joseph College for Women in Hartford, he entered New York University for full-time study. He left NYU in 1964 to accompany Professor Kurt Mislow to Princeton University, where Green was awarded a National Institutes of Health (NIH) fellowship. From 1965 to 1966, he studied at Princeton. He graduated in 1966 with a PhD in organic chemistry. Kurt Mislow served as the advisor on his dissertation, The Absolute Configurations of Sulfoxides and Sulfinates.NYU-Poly blog, Science from AwayPrinceton University Library entry, Mark M. Green On completion of his doctoral degree, he was awarded a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fellowship for a postdoctoral year at Stanford University, with Carl Djerassi as his postdoctoral advisor.Mediander, Mark M. Green With Djerassi, Green studied the use of mass spectrometers in analyzing chemicals. He intended a career in industry, but was convinced to switch to an academic career by Djerassi and his experiences at Stanford. Green was assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Michigan from 1967 to 1974.University of Michigan Faculty History Project, Mark M. Green In 1971, he was visiting professor at Instituto Qu√≠mico de Sarri√°, Barcelona, Spain. In 1972, he was visiting professor at Technion, Haifa, Israel. He was assistant professor from 1974 to 1976 at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan. From 1976 to 1979, Green was associate professor at Clarkson College of Technology, Potsdam, New York. He was visiting professor in 1978 at Jadavpur University, Calcutta, and National Chemical Laboratory, Poona, India, having been appointed Indo-American Scholar under the Fulbright Program. During the years 1974 to 1979, Green became known internationally for his work on the chemistry of the gas phase ions encountered in mass spectrometers. He was attracted to use stereochemical methods to explore a system in which precise kinetic measurements could be made under conditions where there was no intermolecular exchange of energy and therefore an impossible to define temperature. His work was continuously supported by the General Medical Sciences Program of the NIH, and to some extent by the Petroleum Research Fund administered by the American Chemical Society. In 1980 Green moved to the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering) as an associate professor.LinkedIn, Mark M. Green Shortly thereafter, he began to explore stereochemical ideas in polymers. In what became chiral studies of the cooperative nature of polymers he found unexpected phenomena, which have widely influenced work in this area. In 1984, Green was promoted to professor and made a member of the Herman F. Mark Polymer Research Institute. He received a Japan-US Fellowship in 1989 from the NSF and spent a sabbatical year as visiting professor at Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan.

Built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it is used for flood control, irrigation, and recreation. John Martin Reservoir State Park lies on its shore. History In the 1930s, U.S. Representative from Colorado John Martin successfully advocated for legislation in the U.S. Congress approving the building of a reservoir on the Arkansas River for the purposes of flood control. Signed into law in 1939 by President Roosevelt, the legislation assigned the task of construction to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The effort required the U.S. government to buy more than of land and relocate of Santa Fe Railway track. Construction of Caddoa Dam and Reservoir started in the fall of 1939. Rep. Martin died that year, and, in June 1940, both the dam and reservoir were renamed in his honor. Storage of water in the reservoir began in January 1943. The diversion of resources to fighting World War II caused delays in the project until 1946. The dam was finally completed in October 1948. In December 1948, the state governments of Colorado and Kansas signed the Arkansas River Compact, an agreement governing the two states' access to the river's water, including John Martin Reservoir. In 1980, the states developed a plan allocating 60% of the reservoir's water to Colorado and 40% to Kansas. Adherence to the Compact has been a recurrent source of controversy between the two states, serving as a primary factor in the decades-long water conflict litigation Kansas v. Colorado. Geography Aerial view from the north of John Martin Reservoir. Fort Lyon is at the lower far right. John Martin Reservoir is located at (38.0730328, -103.0279951) at an elevation of . It lies in southeastern Colorado in the Colorado Piedmont region of the Great Plains. The entirety of the reservoir lies within Bent County. The reservoir is impounded at its eastern end by John Martin Dam. The dam is located at (38.0666741, -102.9371452) at an elevation of . The Arkansas River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the west and outflow to the east. Smaller tributaries include Rule Creek, which flows into the reservoir from the south, and Gageby Creek, which flows in from the north. U.S. Route 50 runs generally east-west north of the reservoir. Colorado State Highway 183 runs north-south between U.S. 50 and Fort Lyon immediately northwest of the reservoir. A BNSF Railway line runs generally east-west along the reservoir's southern shoreline, crossing the southern arm fed by Rule Creek. The city of Las Animas lies on the south bank of the Arkansas River west of the reservoir. Hasty, an unincorporated community, is located on U.S. 50 roughly north of the reservoir's eastern end. Caddoa, also unincorporated, lies immediately east of the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its recreation and conservation pool. When full, John Martin Reservoir has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. Infrastructure John Martin Dam (2013) John Martin Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam that stands tall and long. A portion of the dam's midsection is a concrete spillway controlled by 16 radial gates which empty into the Arkansas River. When the reservoir is filled to its maximum capacity, the spillway has a discharge capacity of . When the reservoir is filled to the top of its flood control pool, the river outlet has a capacity of . Management The Albuquerque District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages both the dam and the reservoir for the purposes of flood control and irrigation. Colorado Parks and Wildlife manages the reservoir surface and all recreational activities at the reservoir including John Martin Reservoir State Park. The agency also oversees adjoining the park as the John Martin Reservoir State Wildlife Area. Parks and recreation John Martin Reservoir State Park is located on the north shore of the reservoir's eastern end, and it extends east to include the area immediately below the dam. The park hosts boat ramps, camping facilities, a hiking trail, and wetland habitats. Below the dam is a small reservoir named Lake Hasty which includes a swimming beach. John Martin Reservoir is open for sport fishing. Hunting is forbidden in the state park but permitted in the neighboring wildlife area. Points of interest A preserved section of the Santa Fe Trail lies north of the reservoir, commemorated by a historical marker placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Fort Lyon National Cemetery is located immediately west of the reservoir. Wildlife John Martin Reservoir is a productive warm water fishery, providing species including saugeye, wiper, white bass, crappie, and catfish. These fish are stocked as needed. With 373 documented species of birds in Bent County, John Martin Reservoir is considered a premier birding area. Additionally, during winter months, bald eagles can be found throughout the area. During the winter of 2001-2002, 126 eagles were documented. Other wildlife common in the area include deer, prairie dogs, rabbits, raccoons, and squirrels.

The fire began on 2 January 2015 during a day of extreme heat and lasted until 9 January 2015; and burnt more than . Overview The fire began in a semi rural area to the north east of the city, in the locality of Sampson Flat. It later travelled southeast towards the Kersbrook township and across the Mount Lofty Ranges. , at least 26 houses were destroyed with 37 families in temporary accommodation. This count had increased to 38 houses, 125 outbuildings and 134 injuries by the evening of 6 January. The area around Kersbrook was worst hit, with twelve houses destroyed. On 7 January, the number of houses destroyed throughout the affected area was revised down from 38 to 32 and again down to 27 a few days later. There were no fatalities as a result of the bushfires; and the total cost was estimated to be more than 13 million. At the same time, a smaller fire threat was posed near and in the Limestone Coast region on 2 January 2015. Background 2014 was Australia's sixth-warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910. Following Australia's warmest year on record in 2013, both maximum and minimum temperatures remained well above average, with frequent periods of abnormally warm weather throughout the year. For the 6-month period from July to December 2014 southeast South Australia recorded the lowest 5 per cent record of rainfall deficiencies, extending a continued pattern of severe rainfall deficiencies over a 27-month period. On 1 January 2015 a fire weather warning and total fire ban were issued across most of South Australia as the Bureau of Meteorology estimated the temperature in Adelaide would peak at , with temperatures throughout the north-west of the state and stretching down to the Eyre Peninsula estimated to range between on that day. On 2 January the temperature in Adelaide peaked at , approximately degrees above the average December temperature for Adelaide while the following day reached , which further aggravated conditions. Chronology The Sampson Flat fire was declared to be a \\"major emergency\\" at 08:30 ACDT on 3 January 2015, giving the South Australia Police and emergency services additional authority to manage the event and control access in and out of the area. Over thirty roadblocks limited access to the fireground to anybody not involved in the emergency response. Residents started to be allowed back in from 6 January, with their identity and address being checked to limit access to only the roads that had been cleared as safe for travel. Road clearing was suspended on the afternoon of 7 January due to the wind and thunderstorms making the activity unsafe for the cleanup crews. The major emergency declaration was rescinded at 3pm on 7 January, despite it being able to remain in force for 14 days. The weather assisted to contain the fire on Sunday and Monday 4‚Äì5 January with mild winds and temperatures in the range of , but daily temperatures rose again on Tuesday and Wednesday 6‚Äì7 January, with forecast maximum temperature in the range of on both days. Thunderstorms on the afternoon of 7 January produced a spate of new grass fires from lightning, but also brought cooler temperatures, increased humidity, and rain over some parts of the fireground, making it easier to control and extinguish the remaining areas. In the early morning hours of Thursday 8 January, the South Australian Country Fire Service confirmed on its website that the fire had been completely brought under control with crews remaining on the ground to extinguish the remaining hot spots. Extensive rainfall across South Eastern Australia on 9 and 10 January significantly reduced the fire risk. Response Air Tractor AT-802A on its way to deliver another load of fire retardant on 3 January. Over 700 South Australian Country Fire Service volunteers were involved in fighting the fire, supplemented by teams from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service and Victorian Country Fire Authority. A record number of 31 aircraft were available to assist in fighting the fire. The hospital at Mount Pleasant was evacuated of all patients, and the hospital at Gumeracha partially evacuated and closed to new patients due to the impacts of the fire, including that the staff needed to be attending to their own homes and families, and relief staff could not get in. The Prime Minister Tony Abbott together with the Premier Jay Weatherill visited parts of the damaged area in the Adelaide Hills on 7 January 2015 and announced that victims of the bushfires shall be entitled to receive disaster recovery payments via Centrelink. The South Australian government also announced a relief package. Relief packages were offered by a number of financial institutions including the ANZ Bank, BankSA, Bendigo Bank, the Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank, Suncorp Bank, and Westpac. The Government of South Australia activated the South Australian Emergency Relief Fund and called for donations to the Sampson Flat Bushfire Relief Appeal. The Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and Bank SA agreed to accept donations in their retail branches. Additionally, the Commonwealth Bank donated $500,000 to the appeal; and BHP Billiton donated $250,000 as well as agreeing to donate two dollars for every one dollar donated by BHP Billiton's employees. The Australian Red Cross established the Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery fund and delivered disaster assistance from two relief centres established by Housing SA. RSPCA South Australia also called for donations to assist the people and animals affected by the bushfires emergency. Likely cause and damage An early theory for the source of the fire was a backyard incinerator started by a resident on Shillabeer Road in Sampson Flat. At the conclusion of investigations the official cause of the fire was unknown, although police were confident it started within or adjacent to an incinerator. Incinerators are banned in Adelaide suburbs but are legal in rural areas outside the suburbs of Adelaide. The resident of the home where the incinerator was located said a dam pump on the property was not operational until he fixed it two weeks ago and that an irrigation pipe, which was burnt in the fire, was laid on the ground rather than buried underneath. The fires are the worst to affect the Adelaide Hills region since the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires, which was caused by years of drought and extreme heat. In addition to the significant fire in the Adelaide Hills, there was also a major fire in the south east of South Australia, and several in Victoria at the same time. The two large water bombers were based in Victoria at Avalon Airport south of Melbourne, but moved for several days to RAAF Base Edinburgh in northern Adelaide at the height of the fire. From either base, they were flying sorties to both South Australia and to western Victoria. The fire in total had blackened more than of forest and grazing land, including of vineyards stretching a total perimeter of . A number of native wildlife, livestock and family pets perished in the blaze.

It is one of the suburbs which came out of the plan to de-congest thickly populated areas of the Bangalore Cantonment after the bubonic plague. Agricultural fields were converted for this purpose, and town was planned according to modern hygienic standards, with drainage and conservancy conveniences. Cox Town is bound by the Bangalore-Madras Railway line on the North and East, Wheeler Road in the East and the Ulsoor Polo Ground in the South. It comprises the localities of Heerachand Layout, Sindhi Colony, Jeevanahalli, Doddigunta, and roads such as Assaye Road, Charles Campbell Road, Wheeler Road, etc. and is adjoining the suburbs of Fraser Town, Clevland Town and Cooke Town, with easy access to the Bangalore East Railway Station, Ulsoor, Lingarajpuram, Shivaji Nagar. Cox Town is a well planned, posh and preferred suburb in the Bangalore Cantonment, created during the British Raj. The residents of Cox Town follow a liberal 'live a let live'attitude, with suburb still retaining much of its green cover, without excessive commercialisation. In 1988, the BBMP renamed Cox Town as Sarvagnanagar, after a 16th-century saint poet. However, the name has not caught on and continues to be popularly known as Cox Town.  Alexander Ranken Cox  Alexander Ranken Cox, ICS, was a civil servant of the British Madras Presidency, who served as the Collector of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station between 1912 and November 1917. Cox, was educated at Clifton and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, passing the ICS in 1901 and arrived in India on 31 December 1902. During his tenure at the C&M; Station Bangalore, he was successful in continuing the reforms started by the previous collector the C&M; Station F J Richards, ICS (after whom Richards Town is named). The C&M; Station municipality decided to name the new extension of the Bangalore Cantonment after A R Cox. A R Cox also served as the District Collector of the Tirunelveli District between 21 October 1918 to 7 November 1920, the District Collector of the Niligris between 27 October 1928 to 9 March 1931, Collector of Madras around 1931, and Member of the Board of Revenue, Madras Presidency in 1931.  Military Heritage  ITC Infotech Campus at Cox Town, Bangalore Inside the ITC Infotech Campus Many roads in Cox Town are named after battles in which the Madras Sappers took part in. Assaye Road is named after the Battle of Assaye, Meanee Avenue is named after the Battle of Meeanee and the Malakand Lines Training Grounds is named after the Siege of Malakand - All battles in which the Madras Sappers took an active part. Cox Town Market The old British era Cox Town Market was demolished by the BBMP in 1999 after evicting the traders, replacing it with an office block. The promised new Cox Town Market has not come through, and the traders are forced to ply their trade on the footpath and streets, endangering pedestrians and worsening traffic jams. People and Culture Like in other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment, Cox Town has a large Tamil population. They trace their ancestry to the large number of Tamil soldiers, suppliers and workers who were brought into the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, by the British Army, after the fall of Tippu Sultan. Cox Town along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment was directly under the administration of the British Madras Presidency till 1949, when it was handed over to the Mysore State. The large Tamil population co-exist peacefully with Anglo-Indians and other communities, making Cox Town a melting pot of cultures.  Sindhi Colony  Sindhi Colony is a quite residential area of Cox Town, located between Assaye Road and Wheeler Road, with majority Sindhi residents. The Sindhis trace their ancestry from the Sindhi Hindu Refugees who fled the newly formed Pakistan after the Partition of British India, in the face of Hindu-Muslim riots in Sindh. The Colony has 60 houses, a Sindhi Temple, Community Hall and Sindhi Society. Most of the original inhabitants crossed into India through Rajasthan, going towards Bombay and finally settling down in Bangalore Sindhi Colony. The Mysore State Government allocated the land for the Sindhi migrants, offering land at subsidised prices. The Sindhi Cooperative Housing Society was established to help community members buy land and build houses. Most of the Sindhis are into business and run well known businesses such as Kids Kemp, Bhagatram Sweets and Favourite Shop. British Period Cox Town Cox Town, like the rest of the Bangalore Cantonment had a distinct British influence on its culture. It was common sight to see families taking out pedigree dogs out for walks in the mornings. Westen attire was also common. English vegetables, meat, pastry, Indian crispies were readily available, with coffee and dosa costing only one quarter anna. Butlers were dressed in their best, and orthodox people wore a coat and tie along with their Indian attire. One of the residents of British Cox Town was Lydia Muthulakshmi, a young Tamil / Telugu widow of the Naidu caste, who broke shackles of caste regulations by remarrying (in those days, widows were not allowed to remarry, they were forced to stay indoors in Zenanas and not allowed to go outside their homes). At that time caste Hindus fought legal battles by giving police complaints, representations to the government and legal battles in Bangalore, Madras and Trichy, in order to stop Muthulaksmi. She stood firmly against all these efforts and married Rev. Paramanandam of the Wesley Tamil Church. The incident played during 1888-98, also led to caste Hindus withdrawing their children from Christian schools for a brief period. Rev. Picken consulted the Wesleyan Mission Chairman Rev. Josiah Hudson (after whom the Hudson Memorial Church is named after), and tried to delay baptism as long as possible, keeping in view the repercussions on the working of the Mission in Bangalore. The story of Muthulakshmi is told in the book 'From an Indian Zenana: The Story of Lydia Muthulakshmi' by Rev WH Jackson Picken. The book also has an old photograph of the Wesley Tamil Church Haines Road and Narayan Pillai Street, dated 1892.

He is a tenured professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a founding member of the Haitian Creole Academy. His field of scholarship is Creole language, also known as Lang Krey√≤l Linguistics. He is known for his advocacy towards the recognition of Haitian Creole as a full-fledged language. In the fall of 2012, he received a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation to introduce online Creole language materials in the teaching of STEM in Haiti. He believes that Haitian children should be taught in their native language at all levels of instruction, contrary to the tradition of teaching them in French. Degraff believes that instruction in French, a foreign language for most Haitian children, hinders their creativity and their ability to excel. Early life As a child growing up in a middle-class Haitian family and attending a top school where the instruction was in French, Degraff reports that despite being a top student, he often felt that French was a hindrance as not speaking it well caused complexes of inferiority among otherwise bright children. He remembers believing that he spoke one and a half languages, Haitian Creole being the \\"half\\", when in fact the language that all children spoke well by default was Creole. He recalls that French, although imposed at home and at school, was never used for jokes or on the soccer field. Education Dr. DeGraff holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to his PhD, he studied computer science at City College of New York. He arrived at City College from Haiti in 1982. He developed an interest in linguistics during an internship at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1985. Work in Haiti Dr. Degraff currently works with introducing ICT to Haitian children being instructed in Creole at the Mat√®nwa school in La Gon√¢ve. The children are encouraged to use Google Translate to read what is available on the web in languages other than Creole. With a National Science Foundation grant, he is also using computer games in Creole to teach them math skills.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, turgida is in reference to the swollen branches of the thallus. Distinguishing Features Niebla turgida is distinguished by a yellow green bushy thallus to 6 cm high and 15 cm across, divided into tubular swollen branches; the primary branches, which are often round in cross section near base, are loosely connected to a yellowish pigmented holdfast, blackened slightly above base, curve upwards or spread widely and become entangled, mostly narrow in length and prismatic to partially flattened above in cross section, variously fringed along the branch margins, often long tapered to the tip. The cortex is relatively thin, 35‚Äì50 ¬µm thick, with prominent network of raised vein-like ridges on the surface, the longitudinal ridges generally not defining the branch margins, interconnected by diagonal ridges that fork and connect to other ridges; black dot-like pycnidia conspicuous along the cortical ridges; apothecia often in small clusters on lobes of terminal short spur-like branches; the key lichen substance is divaricatic acid, with triterpenes. Similar species are Niebla podetiaforma, distinguished by the smaller thallus with less prominent cortical ridges, and Niebla juncosa that differs by longitudinal cortical ridges that define the branch margins. Taxonomic History Niebla turgida was recognized in regard to pursuing a lichen flora of Baja California from thalli collected inland from the coast between Punta Negra and Punta Rocosa during March 1988.

Geography Big Harts Creek originates in Logan County. Its largest tributaries are Smokehouse Fork, Buck Fork, Big Branch, and West Fork. Its entire headwaters are located in Logan County, while its lower regions lie in Lincoln County. History Perhaps prior to 1800 and certainly shortly thereafter, Stephen Hart, an Indian fighter and ginseng hunter, first settled at Big Harts Creek. At that time, the creek was located in Kanawha County. Hart constructed a cabin at the Forks of Hart (the mouth of Smokehouse Fork) and a smokehouse further up the fork to cure his venison. As more settlers arrived, Hart relocated to Roane County. Harts Creek was named for Stephen Hart. One source claims that it was named due to the plentiful supply of deer (hart) in the vicinity. Richard Elkins was the first permanent settler of Harts Creek, arriving in 1807 or 1815. Elkins lived at the mouth of Harts Creek in the present-day town of Harts, West Virginia. As of 1809, the creek was located in Cabell County. After 1824, it was located in Logan County. During the Civil War, over 90 percent of local men who enlisted to fight served in the Confederate military. In November 1861, Confederate General Albert Gallatin Jenkins and his Confederate forces passed by the creek on their way east with Union sympathizers captured in the town of Guyandotte. Shortly thereafter, while Confederates rested in Chapmanville, West Virginia, Union Major Kellian V. Whaley escaped and made his way to safety up Big Harts Creek to Queens Ridge. His escape was widely reported upon by newspapers. Between 1867‚Äì1869, the lower section of Harts Creek became a part of Lincoln County. Harts Creek District, which includes Big Harts Creek, Big Ugly Creek, Little Harts Creek, Fourteen Mile Creek, Sand Creek, and Green Shoal, constitutes one of Lincoln County's largest districts. From the earliest of times, timbering served as the creek's major industry. After the Civil War, large-scale timbering permeated the creek. The town of Hart, situated at the mouth of the creek, included several merchants. During the 1880s, the Lincoln County Feud occurred on Harts Creek.

In late 1853, George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Hartshorne and a new partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox, formed George A. Johnson & Company and obtained the contract from the U. S. Army to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. Johnson and his partners all having learned a lesson from their previous failed attempts ascending the Colorado, and with the example of the earlier steamboat Uncle Sam, brought the parts of a more powerful side-wheel steamboat, the General Jesup, with them to the mouth of the Colorado from San Francisco. The General Jesup was long with a beam, with its paddle guards, and drew of water. There it was reassembled and launched at a landing in the upper tidewater of the river and reached Fort Yuma, January 18, 1854. This new boat with a 50-horsepower steam engine, capable of carrying 50 tons of cargo unloaded in the estuary up river against the strong current of the Colorado River, was very successful making round trips from the estuary to the fort in only four or five days. Costs of transport of goods to the fort were cut from $500 per ton or more to only $75 per ton. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 Another reason for the speed of the new steamboat beside its powerful engine was the establishment of the wood- yards along the river between the delta and Fort Yuma. The landings were organized by Johnson to supply wood for the steamboats, so the crew would not need to gather wood as they proceeded up river, as the crew of the Uncle Sam had been obliged to do. These landings were each located at about the distance a steamboat could travel up and down river each day on that section of river. Steamboats did not travel at night, due to the danger of running onto sandbars or into snags on the ever-changing river. The boats would be refueled at the landings while tied up overnight. The wood-yards were owned by Yankee's, who hired the Cocopah from local rancherias, to cut the wood (usually cottonwood or mesquite), transport it to the wood-yards and load it onto the boats. Cocopah men often also served as deck hands on the steamboats. Felger, Richard Stephen, Flora of the Gran Desierto and Rio Colorado of Northwestern Mexico, University of Arizona Press, 2000, pp.30‚Äì31 In 1857, George A. Johnson decided to conduct his own expedition up river at his own expense with the General Jesup. The War Department concerned about deteriorating relations with the Mormons in Utah wanted to investigate the possibility of bringing troops into Utah by steamboat up the Colorado River. Fort Yuma's commander provided rations, a mountain howitzer and a detachment of 15 soldiers. With the soldiers and 15 armed civilians Johnson set off from the fort on December 31. The large crew aided in gathering wood for fuel along the way, and 21 days later, Johnson's party had reached the first rapids in Pyramid Canyon, over above Fort Yuma and above the modern site of Davis Dam. Running low on food he turned back after viewing the river ahead continuing another and believed he had proved the river could be navigated as far as the Virgin River which he believed to be only away. Autobiography and Reminiscence of George Alonzo Johnson, Autobiographies and Reminiscences of California Pioneers, Vol. 2., San Diego, 1901. p.15‚Äì16 During the 1858-59 Mohave War the General Jesup and the larger and newer stern-wheeler Colorado where engaged to carry troops and supplies up river for the Mohave Expeditions at $500 per day, and thereafter contracted to support the army posts of Camp Gaston and Camp Mohave, later Fort Mohave. After five years on the Colorado, the now worn out General Jesup was dismantled in 1859. It was replaced by the larger more powerful Cocopah, a stern-wheel steamboat drawing only 19 inches of water, which was better suited to navigating the hazards of the upper Colorado route.

Founded in Hong Kong on Earth Day 2012, Green Monday advocates for at least one plant- based day per week, mobilising the wider community to construct a sustainable global ecosystem of future food. Today one-third of the Hong Kong population is practicing Green Monday, and the Green Monday movement has now expanded to over 30 global regions including Mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Green Monday Group is equipped with advocacy, business, food tech and investment arms, and is designed as a platform to include everyone to be part of the change. Green Monday Foundation works on plant-based advocacy programmes that partner with schools, restaurants and corporate internationally. Green Monday Holdings consists of Green Common and OmniFoods (formerly Right Treat): Green Common is a plant-based food retail, distribution and dining business with a sales network that spreads across more than 10 global regions; OmniFoods is a food tech company with its food science team based in Canada, and its future food innovations include OmniPork, OmniPork Luncheon, OmniPork Strip and OmniEat. Green Monday Ventures is an impact investment arm that supports the growth of plant-based and alternative meat businesses globally. Fortune Magazine ranked Green Monday Group #32 on its 2020 \\"Change the World\\" list, an annual ranking of top businesses that are doing well by doing good. The group's list of recognitions also includes ‚Äú2019 Company of the Year‚Äù by PETA Asia, \\"Sustainable Food Influencer\\" by WWF HK, Roddenberry Prize by the Roddenberry Foundation in 2018, and ‚ÄúTop 50 Most Innovative Companies in China‚Äù in 2014 by Fast Company magazine. https://fortune.com/company/green-monday-group/change-the-world/ https://www.petaasia.com/news/green-monday-2019-company-of-the- year/https://www.wwf.org.hk/en/news/press_release/?23240/Press-Release--WWF- One-Planet-Restaurant-Awards-For-Sustainable-Best-Practice Green Monday's founder David Yeung‚Äôs work has earned him the award of \\"Social Entrepreneur of the Year\\" by Schwab Foundation and the World Economic Forum in 2018. Other honors include the Ashoka Fellowship by the Ashoka Foundation and ‚ÄúCathay ChangeMaker 2020‚Äù by Cathay Pacific Airways. The Rise of Flexitarians in Hong Kong Hong Kong has the highest per capita consumption of meat in the world. According to Euromonitor, Hong Kong people consume an average of nearly 144 kg of meat (including seafood) per year ‚Äî almost a double of the case for mainland China (78 kg). Another research study conducted by The University of Hong Kong's Earth Science Department in May 2018 revealed that Hong Kong's excessive appetite for meat is the main culprit to its high greenhouse gas emission per capita. Hong Kong's high rate of meat consumption per capita stands at 664g per day per capita (equivalent to two pieces of 10oz steak). Pork and beef consumption are the highest, with average daily consumption four times higher than that of the UK's. National Geographic's \\"What the World Eats\\" series illustrates the global change in meat consumption. In 2011, Hong Kong's rate of consumption was 695g per day, while America's was 381g per day. According to a 2020 survey conducted by market research agency Ipsos, 34% of the Hong Kong population now practices a flexitarian or plant-based diet, which translates to more than 2.5 million HongKongers going Green Monday. Compared with the same survey taken in 2018, the number of HongKongers going Green Monday has sharply increased by 44%. The same survey in 2020 also revealed that almost half of the Hong Kong population (or 46%) is aware of Green Monday in 2020, a significant rise compared to the figures in 2014 (17%) and 2018 (32%).  Non-profit Green Monday Campaigns  \\"Green Monday Jockey Club Green It Yourself Programme\\" was the Foundation's community project. In April 2016 (Green Monday's 4th anniversary), they launched \\"Green-It-Yourself\\" (in short, GIY). GIY is a comprehensive campaign to promote vegetarianism and green living. The general public could submit their vegetarian recipes to the activity website, and it created a platform for the exchange of green culinary knowledge both online and offline. From 2016 to 2018, this campaign brought food bloggers and the community together to promote green home cooking through recipe databases, cookbooks, YouTube tutorials, cooking competitions, and blogger meet-ups. In February 2014, the \\"Green Luck Food Rescue Programme\\" launched. It joined hands with food rescue organizations, caterers and shark protection organizations to provide support in redistributing excessive food items at banquets and promote a sustainable banqueting culture. The programme received overwhelming positive feedback and support from the society. The first Greenluck award was held in May 2017, and it acknowledged restaurant partners that were devoted to working against food wastage. Greenluck ceased to operate in 2018. The Restaurant Programme was launched in line with Green Monday in 2012 to promote green living by inviting restaurant partners to add vegetarian or vegan menus to their original menus to make plant-based dishes more accessible. In return, Green Monday promotes these restaurant partners through magazine columns and organic media feature stories. By 2019, over 2,900 restaurant outlets have joined the programme in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Macau, Philippines and mainland China. Iconic restaurant partners include Ming Court of Cordis Hotel, The Butcher's Club Burger, Gyu Kaku, and Pizza Express. Many of the world's most recognized restaurants launched plant-based menus by incorporating plant-based products distributed by Green Common. Examples of these include restaurants at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel. Education Work in Hong Kong In Oct 2012, twenty leading food service providers jointly launched the Green Monday School Programme. As of 2014, More than 800 schools with about 600,000 students from kindergartens to universities in Hong Kong have pledged to practice \\"Green Monday\\". From November 2012 to June 2013, the average vegetarian meal order rate increased from 4% to 42%. Super Green Monday ‚Äì 319 schools participated and offered plant-based catering to students during the 2019 Super Green Monday event on 8 April 2019. 75% of participated schools has a 90% rate of ordering vegetarian meal box, a 50% jump compared to 2018. Major universities in Hong Kong, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University and the Hong Kong University have also joined the Green Monday School Program. The University of Hong Kong was the first to join, and 11 restaurants in HKU campus offered plant-based menu every Monday . In 2018, the Chinese University of Hong Kong‚Äôs Lee Woo Shing College partnered with Green Monday to launch the first credit-bearing General Education course in Hong Kong dedicated to plant- based living. Corporate Green Initiatives in Hong Kong Green Monday seeks to influence the eating habits of many stakeholders, be they restaurants, schools or big corporations. In Oct 2013, the Hong Kong International Airport teamed up with Green Monday to promote low-carbon dining with over 30 catering outlets participating and offering vegetarian choices for travelers. Many other international corporations launched Green Monday in their staff canteens or have invited Green Monday to speak to their staff as a component of HR training and CSR initiatives. These include HSBC Go Green in Aug 2015, UBS, Google Hong Kong office, and WeWork. MGM MACAU officially launched Green Monday in the employee dining room on March 20, 2017, and have continued every Monday since then. A special menu has been created by MGM's chefs for this green initiative. In 2018, Sands Macau launched a plant-based menu in their staff canteen that serves 28,000-plus employees. Subsequently, they started offering green menus in ten of their hotel restaurants under a campaign called \\"Green Cuisine\\". In a TV interview, Mark McWhinnie, Sands China's senior vice president of resort operations and development, said: \\"We estimate that by simply having Green Monday in our team dining room on an annual basis, we save 13,000 tons of carbon emissions which would otherwise go into the atmosphere through one single action.\\" In July 2018, Hysan collaborated with Green Monday to launch the \\"Go Green Causeway Bay\\" campaign. As a result of this initiative, over 20 restaurant outlets in Lee Garden Theater, Lee Gardens, and Hysan Place created special vegetarian or vegan menus. Green Monday also shared its plant-based initiative with the staff at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) on 22 Nov 2018, under their ‚ÄúBetter World‚Äù speaker series.  Green Monday International Development  Green Monday started to grow beyond Hong Kong in 2014. Outside of Hong Kong, Green Monday has launched in New York, Missouri, Los Angeles and Beijing. The University of Columbia was the first university in the US to launch Green Monday on their campus, and Washington University in St. Louis became the second university to join the program in January 2015. UCLA and Tsinghua University later joined the program as well. Green Monday has been adopted by more than 2,000 schools and 600 universities in over 30 countries, directly influencing over 1.5 million students outside Hong Kong. Green Monday officially launched their restaurant programme in Singapore on 16 Nov 2018. Mezza9 at Grand Hyatt Singapore was the first F&B; outlet to launch the plant-based Beyond Burger in August 2018, and over 3,000 vegan burgers were sold in three days. At the time of launch, about 20 groups with over 80 outlets had already enrolled in the programme. This included hospitality groups such as Grand Hyatt Singapore, Mercure Singapore on Stevens, Novotel Singapore on Stevens, Plaza Premium Lounge and The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, restaurant chains such as Cedele, PizzaExpress, Prive and SaladStop!, and the Michelin-recommended restaurant, Whole Earth. Celebrity Michelle Saram also spoke as Green Monday ambassador to advocate the need and benefit of a plant-based diet. Green Monday was officially launched in Taiwan on March 28, 2019 ‚Äî accompanied by the restaurant programme. Taiwan F&B; outlets adding three or more plant-based menus were encouraged to enroll. Over 1,000 restaurant outlets have joined ‚Äî including Bafang Yunji, Grand Hyatt Taipei, Wildwood Live Fire Cuisine, and Darcis Caf√©. Based on a report released in 2017, Taiwan is ranked third among countries with the highest rate of vegetarianism. With a population of 2.5 million people, around 13% of Taiwan's population has adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet. Karena Lam, who received the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress, joined the launch event as a Green Monday Greater China Ambassador with the mission to promote a plant-based diet for the environment. Green Monday made their launch in Thailand in September 2019, bringing sustainable living and more healthy plant-based options to the country. Vuthithorn \\"Woody\\" Milintachinda and Ramita Mahapreukpong ‚ÄúGypso‚Äù joined as Green Monday ambassadors in Thailand. Since the launch, Green Monday has partnered up with over 50 restaurant chains and eateries to offer more plant-based meal choices, including You & Mee restaurant at Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, BBCO at JW Marriott Bangkok, Sizzler, Baan and Veganerie.  Green Common  Green Common is a one-stop plant-based platform with retail, dining and distribution network, providing food choices that are sustainable, innovative and wholesome.

Life Gusner's father, Hans Walter Beyer, was a council official who was killed in the war. She took her name from her mother, who worked as a secretary. Her first few years were spent growing up in Upper Silesia, but in 1945 her family was among the millions of Germans forcibly relocated further west. She ended up in Leipzig, by now in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. She attended school in Markkleeberg, a short distance to the south of the city. After passing her final school exams in 1959 she undertook a one-year practical training as a sorter at the wood processing plant in Wiederitzsch (Leipzig). By this time the Soviet occupation zone had become the stand-alone German Democratic Republic, politically separate both from the former US, British and French occupation zones, which together now comprised the German Federal Republic, and from those parts of Germany to the east of the country's new eastern frontier agreed in 1945 at Potsdam conference, most of which were now incorporated within the redrawn frontiers of Poland or the Soviet Union. Gusner sat and passed the entrance exam to join the film directing course at the Film Academy at the Babelsberg district of Potsdam, but in October 1960 she was selected and sent for further training in the Soviet Union. Between 1961 and 1967 she studied at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK / –í—Å–µ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –∫–∏–Ω–µ–º–∞—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –°.–ê.–ì–µ—Ä–∞—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∞) in Moscow where her teachers included Mikhail Romm. In Moscow her first daughter was born. She received her \\"Short Film Diploma\\" for a film entitled \\"The Insurance Agent\\". Filmography * 1967: Der Versicherungsagent (Strachowoj agent) * 1973/90: Die Taube auf dem Dach * 1974: Was halten Sie von Leuten, die malen * 1976: Man nennt mich jetzt Mimi‚Ä¶ * 1976: Das blaue Licht * 1978: Einer mu√ü die Leiche sein * 1980: Alle meine M√§dchen * 1981: W√§re die Erde nicht rund * 1984: Kaskade r√ºckw√§rts * 1988: Ich liebe dich ‚Äì April! April! * 1993: Sommerliebe Career In 1970 she took a job in Berlin with DEFA, the East German state- owned film studio. Her first assignment involved working as a production assistant on Konrad Wolf's film, \\"Goya or the Hard Way to Enlightenment\\" (1971). In 1972, Gusner began directing feature films for DEFA Films, where she continued to work for many years. Her own first film, \\"The Dove on the Roof\\" (1973) was not released for general viewing in the German Democratic Republic and the original footage was destroyed at the studio. It was not till 1990 that a black and white version could be released, despite that the original film was in color. In 2010 a reconstructed version of the original 1973 film appeared, derived from a working copy that had survived the official destruction. The film concerns a professionally successful young female engineer from Mecklenburg called Linda Hinrichs in search of fulfillment in her private life (played by Heidemarie Wenzel), and her evolving relationships with two contrasting men. It paints an unflattering portrait of the world of work which may explain the adverse reaction of the East German authorities. It is difficult to assess this particular film because of how late it was released due to its controversy. There is not much written about Gusner's films, nor have they been distributed outside of Germany. She was involved in 1973 with a film, \\"Bear Ye One Another's Burden\\" based on an autobiographical part of a novel by Wolfgang Held, but Gusner was evidently not trusted to see the film through to completion, although an officially acceptable version of the film did eventually appear in 1987, directed and apparently re-scripted by Lothar Warneke, and was well received. 1976 saw her production of \\"The Blue Lamp\\", based on a story from the Brothers Grimm. This film was passed for general release. Her 1980 film, \\"All My Girls\\" chimed better with the official mood and is considered Gusner's most successful film. It is an up-beat portrayal of the interactions of six young women who work together in a factory making light-bulbs. It is based on the nonfictional lives of women working at a NARVA factory. For this film Iris Grusner was a co-recipient of the Arts Prize from the national Trades Union Confederation: the film opened the East Germany's first ever National Film Festival, at Karl-Marx-Stadt, later the same year. Here it won first prize from the \\"Film Jury of The Public\\". Several of her films during the 1980s returned to themes involving the lives of working women under socialism. Many of Gusner's films, including \\"All My Girls\\", are considered to be romance films. Despite receiving much acclaim, these films have been dismissed and critiqued by many for their submission to gender roles, however, more contemporary critiques have found feminist undertones to her films that subvert the status quo. In Summer 1989, a few months before the collapse of the GDR, she relocated to Cologne, then West Germany's television capital, and embarked on a career there producing television films and writing screenplays. She has subsequently returned to Berlin. In 1993, she directed the TV film \\"Sommerliebe\\" (1993) with Iris Berben in the lead role of a 48-year-old painter who fell in love with her son's study friend. In 2009 Iris Gusner and the self-proclaimed feminist film director Helke Sander published a \\"Biographical Two-way\\" (\\"biografische Zwiesprache\\") under the title \\"Fantasy and Work\\" (\\"Fantasie und Arbeit\\"). In 2012, Gusner travelled to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the United States to give a retrospective of her films, and discuss her portrayal on emancipating women of East Germany. During her visit, many of her films were being premiered for the first time in the United States.

Realizing that the club could have an advantage by affiliating with established men's clubs, she negotiated a partnership with Lisburn Distillery F.C. for Predators to become their women's team. The team was renamed Lisburn Distillery Predators as a result. Between 1999 and 2002, Lisburn Distillery Predators won the NIWFA Premier League three times and also became the first Northern Irish team to play in the UEFA Women's Cup. In 2006, the partnership with Lisburn Distillery was ended and the club were renamed Newbridge Predators. During this time, they left Lisburn and moved to Hammer Park in Belfast. In 2013, Newbridge Predators finished bottom of the Women's Premier League. However they were not relegated as Fermanagh Mallards were ejected from the league by the Northern Ireland Women's Football Association due to failing to fulfil league fixtures negating a need for relegation. In 2014, Newbridge Predators became affiliated with Shankill United F.C. and were renamed as Shankill United Predators. During this season, they were relegated from the Women's Premier League for the first time after finishing 7th and lost the promotion/relegation play-off against Sion Swifts 6-1 on aggregate.

It was designed by Edward Armstrong and it opened in 1932. It is a Category I heritage building listed with Heritage New Zealand.  History  The Robert McDougall Art Gallery behind the left In 1925 James Jamieson, a wealthy local building contractor, pledged to leave his art collection to Christchurch City on the condition that a new premises were built to house it. The Christchurch City Council held a referendum to gauge public support for taking out a loan to pay for the new gallery. This idea was rejected and nothing happened until 1928 when Robert McDougall donated ¬£25,000 for the gallery to be built. A competition was set up to find an agreeable design. The select committee, which included Robert McDougall, choose Edward Armstrong's design. The site in the botanic gardens behind the Canterbury Museum was chosen. Building of the new gallery commenced in November 1930 and by April 1932 it was near completion when funds ran low. Robert McDougall supplemented his original gift enabling the completion of the gallery at a total cost of ¬£31,000. In total the new gallery housed 160 works, the majority of which came from two collections, the Canterbury Society of Arts and James Jamieson's collection. By 1961 the McDougall's collection had grown to 325 works, and by 2001 it was over 5,000 items. The collection outgrew the Robert McDougall Gallery and the Christchurch Art Gallery was built to house the collection in 2002. The Robert McDougall Gallery was largely empty from the opening of the new art gallery until it was closed permanently after the September 2010 earthquake. The building survived the Christchurch earthquakes and has had some repairs in 2016. It is awaiting more strengthening work to protect it against future earthquakes and it still remains empty. Design The single story gallery has a large central hall, with scagliola columns and marble floors. It is constructed of brick and concrete, and faced with Oamaru stone. Armstrong was inspired by the Sarjeant Gallery in Whanganui. Both the Sarjeant Gallery and the Robert McDougall Gallery use Samuel Hurst Seager's idea of 'topside lighting'. This is where skylights allow natural light to fall onto the displayed pictures without the light falling onto the visitors or the floors.

History Battery A, 1/12 Marines prepare to fire their 105mm gun in 1969 Fire Support Fuller before June 1971 siege, looking north. The base was established on Dong Ha Mountain northeast of The Rockpile north of Highway 9 during Operation Lancaster II. The 3rd Battalion 9th Marines secured Fuller as part of Operation Virginia Ridge on 2 May 1969. By July the 1st Battalion 9th Marines had assumed responsibility of the area around Fuller. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines provided artillery support at Fuller. In late September 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal the 3rd Marine Regiment began its withdrawal from South Vietnam handing over control of Fuller to the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines. The 4th Marines in turn handed over Fuller to elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) on 5 November 1969. On 30 April 1970 at 00:55 a unit of the 1st Brigade at Fuller received mortar fire followed by an attack by People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) sappers. The defenders returned fire supported by artillery and helicopter gunships and the PAVN withdrew leaving 16 dead. On 16 August 1970 a unit of the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment at Fuller was hit by 70 120mm mortar rounds killing 14 ARVN and destroying 20 bunkers. 1971 On 22 June 1971 following an artillery barrage the PAVN launched a major attack on the ARVN base on Fuller, despite reinforcements and B-52 strikes the ARVN were pushed out of Fuller, but recaptured the base on 28 June having killed over 500 PAVN. A further PAVN attack on 1 July was repulsed. 1972 By January 1972 the ARVN 3rd Division had assumed responsibility for the area north of Highway 9. Fuller was occupied by the 1st Battalion, 2nd ARVN Regiment. From January the ARVN on Fuller together with the Vietnamese Marines on Firebase Sarge reported a buildup on PAVN forces in the surrounding area. The PAVN launched their Easter Offensive on 30 March 1972 and PAVN artillery fire hit Fuller along with all other ARVN and Marine positions along the DMZ. Units of the PAVN 308th Division assaulted Fuller and by midday on 31 March the PAVN had overrun Fuller. Current use The base has reverted to jungle.

He is a professor at INSEAD, where he has served as co-Dean. He currently holds the INSEAD Chaired Professorship in Corporate Governance, and is a Fellow at CEDEP. His broad research interests are in fair process, leadership, and business model innovation. His teaching interests also include leadership and team dynamics, project management, and family business management. Career Van der Heyden was on the faculty at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University from 1978 to 1980. He subsequently became a professor at the School of Organizations and Management at Yale University from 1980 to 1988. Van der Heyden joined INSEAD's Technology Management Department in 1988. He served as co-Dean of the school from 1990 to 1995, first with Claude Rameau and secondly with Antonio Borges. Van der Heyden subsequently held the Wendel Chair in the Large Family Firm, the Solvay Chair of Technological Innovation, and the Mubadala Chair in Corporate Governance and Strategy. Work Van der Heyden's early work was in the field of operations management. His more recent contributions cover business models, corporate governance, and organizational Fair Process. His 1999 HBR article,Mintzberg and Van der Heyden 1999 co- authored with Henry Mintzberg, presented a new visual tool, the organigraph, that allowed managers to identify potential opportunities for improving a firm's business. In 2008, in a paper with Christoph Loch and Yaozhong Wu,Wu, Loch, and Van der Heyden 2007 he developed a model to explain why Fair Process principles may not be applied in firms even when there is agreement that they lead to improved decision-making and execution. In a 2009 article with Bert Spector and Jose Santos,Santos, Spector, and Van der Heyden 2009 Van der Heyden proposed a comprehensive model for understanding business model innovation, identifying four separate but interrelated components: a set of elemental activities; a set of organizational units that perform the activities (some internal to the firm, others external); a set of linkages between the activities, made explicit by transactions between organizational units and human relationships among the individuals who supervise and/or manage the linked organizational units; and a set of governance mechanisms for controlling the organizational units and the linkages between units. The paper further argues that interlinked business units are more likely to innovate business models than freestanding business units if the corporation is able to create a favorable context. Other Affiliations Van der Heyden is a supervisory or advisory board member for several funds managed by Bencis Capital Partners. He was vice president for P√¥le Sud Paris, a not-for-profit association supporting economic development in the South Paris region, and secretary general of the scientific committee of the Comit√© pour la Langue du Droit Europ√©en.

The book was published to mark Amado‚Äôs 80th birthday in 1992. It covers his entire life, with the exception of his childhood, which he had earlier recorded in The Grapiuna Boy. Navega√ß√£o de cabotagem contains memories from the mid-1920s onwards, including observations on his own works and on the television and film adaptations of these, with memories of his family and friends, as well as other writers and artists he had contact with. It describes experiences such binge drinking with the Chilean writer Pablo Neruda, and visits to a brothel or candombl√© yard with the artist Caryb√© or the musician and painter Dorival Caymmi. Other recollections include meetings with Pablo Picasso, Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Garc√≠a-M√°rquez, and Jean-Paul Sartre.

The bill will allow the government to establish a National DNA Data Bank and a DNA Profiling Board, and use the data for various specified forensic purposes. The bill has raised concerns of privacy among citizen rights groups. The bill was expected to be presented in the parliament in the monsoon session of 2015. History The bill was originally proposed in 2007 and in 2012 drafting of the bill began. The draft bill was prepared by the Department of Biotechnology. The bill proposes to form a National DNA Data Bank and a DNA Profiling Board, and use the data for various specified purposes. The proposed DNA Profiling Board will consist of molecular biology, human genetics, population biology, bioethics, social sciences, law and criminal justice experts. The Board will define standards and controls for DNA profiling. It will also certify labs and handle access of the data by law enforcement agencies. There will be similar bodies at state levels. The bill will also create a National DNA Data Bank, which will collect data from offenders, suspects, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies and volunteers. It will profile and store DNA data in criminal cases like homicide, sexual assault, adultery and other crimes. The data will be restricted and will be available only to the accused or the suspect. A person facing imprisonment or death sentence can send a request for DNA profiling of related evidence to the court that convicted him. The bill has the provision that any misuse of data will carry a punishment of up to three years imprisonment and also fine. Criticism and support The bill has been criticised for not addressing the concerns of privacy. The Citizens Forum for Civil Liberties has opposed the bill on privacy concerns and sent a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission of India in 2012. A. P. Shah committee report In October 2012, an expert committee headed by Ajit Prakash Shah presented its report. It said that there should be safeguards to prevent illegal collection and use of DNA data. There should be also safeguards to prevent the proposed body from misusing them. The report also suggested that there should a mechanism using which citizens can appeal against the retention of data. There should also be a mechanism of appeal under which citizens under trial can request a second sample to be taken. The samples must be taken after consent in case of victims and suspects. However, samples can also be taken from crime scenes. The committee noted that although the bill allows volunteers to submit samples, there is no proper procedure to obtain consent and there is no mechanism under which volunteer can withdraw their data. The committee proposed that before giving the data to a third party, the person must be notified and consent must be sought, if the third party is not an authorised agency. The report said that purpose for which data is being collected should be state publicly, and the data should be destroyed after the purpose has been served and the time frame has expired. The report said bodies collecting, analysing and storing DNA data should be made to release an annual report, detailing their practices and organisational structure. Lokniti Foundation vs Union of India In 2012, a non- government organization (NGO) called Lokniti Foundation filed a public interest litigation against the government in the Supreme Court of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No.491 of 2012, stating that India does not have a national DNA database to address the issue of thousands of unclaimed dead bodies in India that are reported annually. The Supreme Court asked the government to present a roadmap detailing how the bill will implement mandatory DNA profiling of unclaimed bodies. The government replied to concern by stating that the bill will establish a national database which will help identify unclaimed bodies, and returned rescued children and adults to their families. The database would store DNA profiles from the relatives of missing persons, and also from convicts, accused and volunteers. The government also added in the affidavit that India also lacks trained personnel to implement it It has also been stated that the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India was in the process of acquiring specialized software from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), USA for cross matching of DNA profiling data. India has 30-40 DNA examiners and a DNA examiner can handle 100 cases per year. However, India gets 40,000 unclaimed bodies annually, the purpose will require at least 400 DNA examiners. Since, a single case requires , annually crore will be required for 40,000 cases, excluding salaries of the examiners and support personnel. The government also said that the final bill will be presented in March 2015. It has been halted due to privacy concerns raised by some NGOs and expert committee set up by the Department of Biotechnology is addressing them.

(17 October 1917 ‚Äì 28 December 2013), was a graduate in Music and German from Cardiff University who during the Second World War worked as a civilian codebreaker for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. She worked in Hut 6, decrypting messages in Enigma machine cipher. Having signed the Official Secrets Act, she did not talk about her war work until 1998.Robin Turner, \\"Bletchley Park uncovered: The secret life of the Welsh World War II codebreaker\\", Wales Online, Jul 27, 2014. Then, with the assistance and co- authorship of her son, Gethin Russell-Jones, she produced a memoir, My Secret Life in Hut Six (Lion Books, Oxford, 2014).Robin Turner, Welsh codebreaker Mair Russell-Jones recognised Alan Turing's genius at an early age at Bletchley Park, Wales Online, 16 Nov. 2014. Her Book She wrote the book ‚ÄòMy Secret Life in Hut Six: One woman‚Äôs Experience at Bletchley Park‚Äô that was published in 2014. The book was written by her and her son, she died on the day the book was completed. It was based on her involvement in attempting to break the German Enigma Code. She discusses her experience on working in unconformable conditions, the danger and strain she suffered as a woman during her time at Bletchley Park. Her son, the co-author for this book describes the book as a ‚Äúridiculous tale of silence‚Äù. The book combines Mair‚Äôs first hand experiences and feelings about the war and being part of the secret service. It also included her son‚Äôs and other's opinions who knew her from Bletchley Park or after. The book indicates that in 1998, Mair was given ‚ÄòThe Secrets of Station X‚Äô written by Michael Smith. Station X contains black and white images of the machines, people and buildings, and the room Mair was situated in which was Hut Six, which was known as the Decoding Room. ‚ÄúStation X ‚Äì known now as Bletchley Park ‚Äì was the hub of Britain‚Äôs code-cracking effort, where hugely talented mathematicians, inventors and ‚Äúbright young things‚Äù like Mair Russell-Jones worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping- hand. As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle.‚Äù The book also highlights Mair‚Äôs love for music and her abilities. It is stated that ‚Äúher parents are members of local choirs and keen to instill a love of music in their daughters‚Äù. Furthermore, she claims that ‚Äúwhen she was five, she started piano lessons‚Äù. Her ambition was to become a concert pianist. Her musical abilities came to use during her time at Bletchley Park because her knowledge of music also helped in her ability to see patterns in passages that needed to be decoded. In the book, Mair Russel-Jones states ‚Äúthe freedom to learn and lead was so liberating‚Äù. This suggests that women were on equal footing with men and inequalities were not highlighted when it came to the secret service. In a review of Mair‚Äôs book ‚ÄòMy Secret Life in Hut Six, and about the women of Bletchley, Christensen claims ‚ÄúAt its peak in May 1945, more than 12,000 people worked at Bletchley or its outstations, over 8,000 of them women.‚Äù In November 2011, Mair Russell-Jones discussed the war and how it affected her personal life to BBC. She claimed, ‚ÄúI had a boyfriend and a family, and not telling them what I was doing, or even where I was working almost felt as though I was lying to them‚Äù. This conveys that she was almost living a dual life, as she was sworn to secrecy about all things Bletchley Park. Whenever she was asked what she did, she would reveal that she worked for the Foreign Office in Bletchley.
