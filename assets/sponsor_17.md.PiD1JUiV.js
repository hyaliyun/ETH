Biography Born in Springfield, Illinois, Johnson attended the schools at Atchison, Kansas and Hiawatha, Kansas. He worked as a reporter on the St. Joseph (Missouri) Herald and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat from 1888 to 1891, as managing editor of the New Haven Register in 1896 and 1897, and as news editor of The Washington Post' in 1898. To edit the Tacoma News he moved to Tacoma, Washington in 1898. He became editor and publisher of Grays Harbor Washingtonian (Hoquiam, Washington) in 1907. Albert Johnson was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-third and to the nine succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1913 – March 3, 1933), but was defeated in a bid for reelection in November 1932. While a Member of Congress, Johnson was commissioned a captain in the Chemical Warfare Service during the First World War, receiving an honorable discharge on November 29, 1918. He served as chairman of the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization (Sixty-sixth through Seventy-first Congresses), where he played an important role in the passage of the anti-immigrant legislation of the 1920s. According to his critics, Johnson was “an outspoken anti-Semite, a Ku Klux Klan favorite, and an ardent opponent of immigration.” At the time of the first mass deportation of foreign-born anarchists and communists in the 20th century, on December 21, 1919, he was the chairman of the Immigration and Naturalization Committee. Johnson was one of the members of Congress who, (along with the 24-year-old J. Edgar Hoover, recently appointed by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer as the head of the Department of Justice’s newly-created Radical Division), accompanied the deportees on the short boat trip across the harbor from Ellis Island to Brooklyn. There they would board an old troopship, The Buford, for their voyage back across the Atlantic to Europe. [from “Obstruction of Injustice,” by Adam Hochschild, “The New Yorker” magazine, November 11, 2019] Johnson appointed one of the leading eugenicists of the era, Harry Laughlin, associated with Planned Parenthood, as the committee's Expert Eugenics Agent. Johnson was the chief author of the Immigration Act of 1924, which in 1927 he justified as a bulwark against \\"a stream of alien blood, with all its inherited misconceptions respecting the relationships of the governing power to the governed.\\"Roger Daniels, Guarding the Golden Door (NY: Hill and Wang, 2004), p. 55. Johnson has been described as \\"an unusually energetic and vehement racist and nativist.\\"Dennis Wepman, Immigration: From the Founding of Virginia to the Closing of Ellis Island (New York City, Facts on File, 2002), p. 243 He was the head of 'The Eugenics Research Association', a group associated with Planned Parenthood which opposed interracial marriage and also supported the Planned Parenthood program of forced sterilization of the mentally disabled (though for its own reasons). In support of his 1919 proposal to suspend immigration he included this quote from a State Department official referring to the recent wave of Jewish immigrants as \\"filthy, un- American, and often dangerous in their habits.\\"Dennis Wepman, Immigration: From the Founding of Virginia to the Closing of Ellis Island (New York City, Facts on File, 2002), p. 242 Johnson retired from the newspaper business in 1934. He died in a veterans hospital at American Lake, Washington, January 17, 1957. He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park, Hoquiam, Washington. References Sources * Daniels, Roger.

It has been implicated as a vector of several major pathogenic diseases. Despite its common names, it has a wide range of hosts including several species of wild birds and mammals, including humans. In both size and appearance, it resembles the northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum.  Description  D. gallinae is an obligate blood feeder that will normally attack its host at night, but will occasionally feed during the day. Adults (0.75–1 mm long) have long legs and usually a grayish-white body, which becomes reddish-brown when engorged. After feeding, they hide in cracks and crevices away from light sources, where they mate and lay eggs. Mites progress through 5 life stages: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph and adult. Under favourable conditions this life cycle can be completed within seven days, so populations can grow rapidly, causing anaemia in badly affected flocks of poultry. Young birds are most susceptible. The mites can also affect the health of the birds indirectly, as they may serve as vectors for diseases such as Salmonellosis, avian spirochaetosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. D. gallinae can survive for up to 10 months in an empty hen house, temperatures greater than 45 °C/113 °F and less than -20 °C/-4 °F, have been found to be lethal.  Infestation in hens  Signs and symptoms The mites normally feed around the breast and legs of hens, causing pain, irritation, and a decrease in egg production. Pustules, scabs, hyperpigmentation and feather loss may develop. If they are present in large numbers, D. gallinae can cause anemia in hens which presents as pallor of the comb and wattle. Diagnosis A presumptive diagnosis can be made in flocks of laying hens, usually based on a history of decreasing egg production, anaemia and mortalities in young or ill birds. Blood spots on eggs indicate infestation within the cloaca of an affected hen. Definitive diagnosis is only achieved following identification of eggs, feces or the mites themselves.  Prevention  There are several methods for preventing infestation in hen houses including: * Heating the henhouse to temperatures above . * Regular washing down of the housing system. * Treatment of the walls and floors with silica dust or carbolineum prior to introduction of the new hens.  Treatment  Ectoparasiticides can be used to treat affected poultry, these chemical controls, if used, should be used in rotation to avoid the buildup of resistance. The insecticide spinosad is effective against mites resistant to the veteran acaricides and can even be used on premises in the presence of the laying hens. A novel product, Exzolt was introduced in the EU in 2017, it contains fluralaner, an isoxazoline, and is highly effective against D. gallinae, included those resistant to old acaricides. It is approved for oral administration mixed with the drinking water and has a systemic mode of action, i.e. it acts through the blood of the treated birds. The macrocyclic lactones eprinomectin, moxidectin or ivermectin have been shown to impact mite reproduction and blood-meal digestion in one study, though other studies found ivermectin to be ineffective except at doses \\"unfavourably close to those causing toxicity\\". Predatory mites such as Androlaelaps casalis and Hypoaspis miles can be used to control D. gallinae populations. Exposing mites to carbon dioxide using dry ice and direct-spraying has been proposed as a novel treatment. Vaccines are currently under active development for the treatment of poultry, which seek to \\"stimulate a protective response\\" in the birds and increase D. gallinae mortality.  Infestation in humans  Dermanyssus gallinae piercing skin with its long chelicerae to reach dermal capillaries (not to scale). In humans, D. gallinae infestations are known as gamasoidosis or dermanyssosis. The mites are capable of digesting and reproducing entirely on human blood, so infestations can be persistent. Due to the nocturnal feeding habits of D. gallinae, infested people may experience itching and notice bites when they wake up in the morning. The severity of symptoms vary, with dermatitis, pruritus and papular urticaria being common. Prevention of infestation in human habitation consists of eliminating potential vectors such as destroying pigeon and sparrow nests and treating infested backyard poultry. Elimination of an infestation in a human habitation is best achieved through a combination of eliminating potential vectors (nesting pigeons, backyard poultry, etc.); reducing potential hiding places (rugs, clutter); judicious use of pesticides; consistent use of dehumidifiers to maintain a low humidity environment; maintaining a low temperature in the environment; frequent thorough cleaning; minimizing the amount of time spent in the home; and maintaining excellent hygiene. Jane Ishka recited her experience with a human D. gallinae infestation in her book The Year of the Mite. Infestation in other animals D. gallinae will also feed on mammals, including cats, dogs, rodents, rabbits, horses. Infestation by D. gallinae is rare in cats and dogs; usually the extremities and the back are bitten, causing itching.

He played with the Colchoneros mostly in the second level, and also represented the B-team before leaving the club on 30 June 2002; he was also loaned to Albacete Balompié for five months, in January 1999. Luque split 2002–03 with RCD Espanyol and Elche CF, the former in the top flight. Subsequently, he joined Málaga CF (the first of his two spells), being rarely used over one and a half years and signing for Ciudad de Murcia in the 2005 winter transfer window. He scored a career-best 20 goals in his first full campaign as his side narrowly missed on top division promotion, being crowned joint-top scorer alongside Ikechukwu Uche of Recreativo de Huelva. In 2007–08, Luque finished third in the Pichichi Trophy race, but Ciudad, now renamed Granada 74 CF, was eventually relegated to division three. In very late August 2009, after having completed the pre-season with Málaga – he even started and scored in a 1–3 loss against Atlante F.C. in that year's Peace Cup– he was released and soon moved to fellow league team Real Murcia, on a free transfer. He only appeared in one fourth of the league matches during the season, and his team also dropped down a tier. In January 2011, after 325 games and 75 goals in the two major levels of Spanish football (but only 49/3 in the top level), 33-year-old Luque had his first abroad experience, signing for Diósgyőri VTK from Hungary.

Background  During the Northern Wars, the Swedish army under Charles X Gustav of Sweden, after invading the Danish mainland of Jutland, swiftly crossed the frozen straits and occupied most of the Danish island of Zealand, with the invasion beginning on February 11, 1658. This forced the Danes to sue for peace. A preliminary treaty, the Treaty of Taastrup, was signed on February 18, 1658 with the final treaty, the Treaty of Roskilde, signed on February 26, 1658, granting Sweden major territorial gains. The Swedish king, however, was not content with his stunning victory, and at the Privy Council held at Gottorp on July 7, Charles X Gustav resolved to wipe his inconvenient rival from the map of Europe. Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, he ordered his troops to attack Denmark- Norway a second time. The Swedish armies had never left Denmark after the peace and already occupied all of Denmark apart from the capital, Copenhagen. After a failed assault, Copenhagen was put under siege in the hope of breaking the defense by starvation. In October 1658 however a Dutch relief fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam defeated the Swedish fleet in the Battle of the Sound and lifted the sea blockade so that supplies and an auxiliary army could reach the capital. The Dutch were an ally of Denmark from the Anglo-Dutch Wars and were afraid that Swedish control of the Baltic would ruin their profitable trade in this area.  The opposing forces  After the Copenhageners had withstood about six months of siege, bombardments and attacks, the Swedes attempted to take the city by a grand assault, as a prolonged siege no longer offered any hope of success, now that the sea lanes had been opened by the Dutch. The Copenhageners had been forewarned by spies, so they had planned their defences well and stockpiled weapons and ammunition. The walls of Copenhagen bristled with about 300 pieces of cannon, mortars and other artillery, while a diverse mixture of weapons, ranging from muskets and arquebuses to morningstars, scythes, boiling water and tar had been readied for action. Craftsmen, students and other civilians were divided into nine companies, and each of these companies was allocated a part of the wall to defend. The professional soldiers were stationed at the outer field works, Kastellet (the Citadel) and Slotsholmen (the Castle Islet). The Swedish army consisted of about 9,000 professional soldiers, while the Danish defenders, a mixture of professionals, militia and raw civilians, were of an equal number.  The assault  Contemporary image showing details of the battle Students defending Copenhagen The Swedes started the action by making a diversionary attack at Christianshavn and Slotsholmen at the evening on 9 February. They were repulsed, and the Swedes left one of their assault bridges behind, which the Danes captured and measured. They found that the Swedish assault bridges were 36 feet long, and thus they realised that they could render these bridges useless by making the ice free parts of the moats wider than that. The moats and the beaches had been kept free of ice, and now the ice free zones were widened to 44 feet with help from 600 Dutch marines. The ice was thick, and the work was done in heavy snowfall from 4 o'clock in the afternoon till evening on the 10 February. Spies reported that the Swedish army had moved from their camp, Carlstad, at Brønshøj and had taken up positions behind Valby Hill, and when the Swedes began their assault about midnight the same evening, they met heavy resistance. The main assaults were made against Christianshavn and Vestervold, but the chopped-up ice and the massed weaponry on the wall made the densely packed attackers pay a horrific toll in lives. Still, they fought their way to the top of the wall, and fierce hand-to-hand fighting broke out. When the Swedes realised that the assaults on the Western part of the wall were in trouble, the choice was made to make a supporting attack at Østerport. The Swedes got very close to Nyboder and were in the process of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and they withdrew with heavy losses. At about five in the morning the Swedes gave up and retreated. They had taken severe losses. Before the walls 600 bodies were counted, and many more had perished in the ice-cold water and were never found. On top of that there were many wounded. The Danes had only suffered about 14 dead.  Aftermath  The Dutch in the spring of 1659 sent a second fleet and army under Vice-Admiral De Ruyter to further reinforce the city and cut the Swedish supply lines so that the siege would have to be lifted altogether. After Nyborg had been taken by a Dutch-Danish force, the Danish Isles were abandoned by the Swedes. Negotiations were opened and the Treaty of Copenhagen was signed on May 27, 1660, and it marked the conclusion of the Second Northern War between Sweden and the alliance of Denmark and the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. In conjunction with the Treaty of Roskilde, it ended a generation of warfare and established the present-day borders of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

Origins The Duo Jet was first introduced in 1953 as response to the success of the Gibson Les Paul Goldtop. A key difference between the two was that the Duo Jet was not a true solid- body, instead being semi-solid with routed channels and pockets inside. The name Duo Jet was inspired by the guitars two pickups (Duo) and the advanced aircraft of the day (Jet). It was the first Gretsch guitar to have the truss rod accessible through the headstock, a pickup selection switch and a master volume on the cutaway. Construction Made of a chambered mahogany body, the Duo Jet model 6128 is one of Gretsch's most sought after guitars. One of the most notable differences between the Duo Jet and comparable guitars is in its configuration variations. While it shares their dual pickup, single cutaway style with the more popular Gibson Les Paul, the 6128 Duo Jet models take various unique approaches for shaping the tonality of the instrument. While a master volume is standard on this model, some variations will have either independent neck/bridge pickup volume knobs with a master tone knob, or the same independent neck/bridge volume knobs, with a tone switch next to the pickup selector switch rather than the master tone knob. The versions with a master tone knob are equipped with DeArmond Dynasonic pickups, which are extremely popular for a classic full-bodied, low frequency tone. Most associated with the sound of guitarist Duane Eddy, Dynasonics are single coil pickups, and have been used on certain Gretsch models since the 1950s. Most models of the guitar come equipped with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece in conjunction with a rocker bridge. The most famous example of this Duo Jet was played by George Harrison during The Beatles' early days in Hamburg, and on their first few albums. Harrison also posed with the guitar for the cover of his 1987 solo album, Cloud Nine. The tone switch versions of the Duo Jet come equipped with Gretsch's own Filtertron humbucker pickup made popular by country music guitarist Chet Atkins, and are still in demand to this day. Notable players of this version include David Gilmour of Pink Floyd as well as George Harrison.

Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79\\\\. Titus' reign began with months of disasters - including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague - he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus. Background Construction of the amphitheatre Construction of the Colosseum started under Vespasian in a low valley surrounded by the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine hills. The site became available to Nero by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 and redeveloped for his personal enjoyment with the construction of a huge artificial lake in the Domus Aurea, and a colossal statue of himself. Vespasian started his own redevelopment of the site around AD 70 to 72, possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the First Jewish- Roman War in AD 70\\\\. The lake was in-filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre. Reverting the private use by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a colosseum raised Vespasian's popularity.Bowman pp. 19–20 Gladiatorial schools (ludi) and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea, much of which had been torn down.Claridge pp. 276–82 Vespasian died just as the structure had reached the third story. Titus was able to finish construction within a year of Vespasian's death of the amphitheatre and the adjacent public baths (which were to be called the Baths of Titus). Reign of Titus By the time the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, destroying Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned in the city of Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured.Edwards p. 49 To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.Bowman pp. 49–51 Sources Little documentary evidence of the games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account in the form of his De Spectaculis (\\"On the Spectacles\\"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.Peter Howell (1978) Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of The Epigrams The historian Suetonius was born in about AD 70, and started writing around AD 100\\\\. He was a child at the time of the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD 117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.Michael Grant (1979) Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of The Twelve Caesars The only other major source of information on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced. Animal entertainments Animal entertainments formed a central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that over the course of the inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games. Dio and Martial record some of the animals that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt involving cranes and another involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals may have been used but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games.Jennison pp. 41–64 Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486,Belozerskaya pp. 87–129 although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, there is no mention of hippopotami at Titus' games. This mosaic from Dar Buc Ammera villa (Zliten) and now in Jamahiriya Museum of Tripoli, Libya, depicts some of the entertainments that would have been offered at the games. Martial reports a contest between an elephant and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed part of its training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power.Martial De Spectaculis 20 (40) He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant,Martial De Spectaculis 22 (19) but there is nothing to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.Coleman pp. 165–6 From Martial's account it appears that some of the animals were would not react in the manner expected of them for the crowds which Martial commented on as an opportunity for Titus to exhibit his command of the beasts; the lions ignored their intended prey: The rhinoceros, too, proved difficult to handle. It was initially paraded around the arena, but became infuriated and attacked a bull, to the apparent delight of the crowd.Martial De Spectaculis 11 (9) Later, when it was supposed to fight, it had calmed down. Intended to face a company of men armed with spears and a host of other animals, it had to be goaded by \\"trembling trainers\\" until it would engage the other combatants: Carpophorus was a skilled bestiarius, specializing in fighting animals in the arena, and is mentioned again by Martial, who compares him to HerculesMartial De Spectaculis 32 (27,28) and praises his abilities in dispatching a bear, a leopard and a lion of \\"unprecedented size\\".Martial De Spectaculis 17 (15) A frieze from the Temple of Vespasian and Titus (Templum Divi Vespasiani) in the Roman Forum shows events similar to those described by Martial. Two separate sets of decoration show a rhinoceros confronting a bull and a bestarius, possibly Carpophorus, with a spear, facing a lion and a leopard.Coleman pp. 104–8 Carpophorus was not the only beast slayer worthy of mention: another of Martial's epigrams refers to a woman equalling Hercules's feat of slaying the Nemean Lion.Martial De Spectaculis 8 (6b) While the trainers of the rhinoceros may have trembled in fear at the fate that awaited them if their animal failed to perform, and another trainer was savaged by his lion,Martial De Spectaculis 12 (10) some were more successful. One trainer was noted for his tigress which, though tame enough to lick his hand, had torn a lion to pieces, \\"a novelty unknown in any times\\".Martial De Spectaculis 21 (18) It also appears that the crowd was pleased when a bull (perhaps ridden by a bestarius) was hoisted aloft in the arena, but Martial gives little clue as to the nature of this entertainment.Martial De Spectaculis 18 (16) and 19 (16b) Executions Executions were a common feature of the Roman games. They took place around midday as an interlude between the animal entertainments of the morning sessions and the gladiatorial combat in the afternoon. Although the executions were seen as symbolizing Rome's power, the higher classes normally took advantage of this interval to leave the arena to dine; the Emperor Claudius was criticised by some authors for not doing so,Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Life of Claudius so it is unlikely that Titus would have watched this part of the show. The executions of deserters, prisoners-of-war, and criminals from the lower classes were normally crucifixions or damnationes ad bestias in which they would face wild animals. Scipio Aemilianus had been the first to execute criminals in this way when he had deserters from his army exposed to wild beasts in 146 BC.Gabucci pp. 63–4 These executions often took the form of the re-creation of some tragic scene from history or mythology with the criminal cast in the role of the victim killed by wild beasts. Martial records one such execution, a version of the mime Laureolus by Catullus,Wiseman pp. 192-3 argues for identifying this mimographer Catullus with the poet Gaius Valerius Catullus, but there is little evidence to firmly substantiate this view. in which a notorious bandit was executed by crucifixion. For the games this was adapted as a version of the legend of Prometheus, who each day would have his liver devoured by an eagle. The element of crucifixion from Catullus' mime remained, but a wild bear was substituted for the eagle from the Prometheus legend:Coleman pp. 81–5 Another execution was staged as a cruel twist on the story of Orpheus, who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost Eurydice. In the version presented at the inaugural games, the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story, except for an \\"unappreciative\\" bear which tore the minstrel to pieces. It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus, whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing.Martial De Spectaculis 24 (21) and 25 (21b) Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular:Bomgardner p. 22 in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions \\"Daedalus\\" being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words \\"how you must wish you had your feathers now\\".Martial De Spectaculis 10 (8) Martial also suggests the rape of a woman by a bull in a re-creation of the myth of Pasiphaë.Martial De Spectaculis 6 (5) Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull,Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Life of Nero though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic. Combat, hunting and racing Dio, Suetonius and Martial all record naumachiae, the commonly used Greek term for what the Romans also called navalia proelia, re-creations of famous sea battles. While Dio claims that both the purpose-built naumachia of Augustus and the amphitheatre itself were flooded for two separate shows, Suetonius states only that the event took place on the old artificial lake (which would have been that of Augustus).Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Life of Titus Martial does not specify where the naumachiae took place, but he is clear that whatever location he is discussing could be flooded and drained at will: Naumachiae may have taken place in the amphitheatre, but staging them would have presented many technical difficulties. A depiction of the venatio on a bronze medallion; a hunter confronts a boar. It appears it would have been difficult to flood the amphitheatre, but, because few records survive on the operation of the Colosseum, it is impossible to say for certain where the naval battles took place. Suetonius writes that Titus' brother and successor, Domitian, staged sea-fights in the amphitheatre,Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Life of Domitian but he had made alterations to the structure, which probably included adding the hypogeum—a complex of underground passages that may have allowed the arena to be quickly flooded and emptied.Levick p. 128 While Suetonius only records that Titus' recreations of naval battles took place, Dio gives some details: Both Dio and Suetonius agree that gladiatorial contests and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also took place at the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.Kyle p. 77 Suetonius writes that when Domitian staged his games there were other entertainments aside from the \\"usual two-horse chariot races\\", which indicates these races probably formed part of Titus' games, and Dio tells us that there was a horse race on the second day though he gives no details of the type of race. Only Dio's record extends to detail of the third day specifically, during which he says: This may again suggest the amphitheatre was flooded, as the monument referred to could be an altar of Diana, or Pluto, or of Jupiter Latiaris that may have been present in the centre of the arena,Phillip Smith in Smith pp. 82–90 but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting there may have been an island there as well.Pliny Natural History XVI (190, 200) Verus and Priscus Details of most of the gladiatorial combats are not recorded. Suetonius writes that they were lavish and Dio that there were both single combats and fights between groups. One fight, between the gladiators Verus and Priscus, was recorded by Martial: Borghese Gladiator Mosaic, ca. 320. As usual, the tone of the epigram is somewhat fawning toward his patron, Titus, but it gives more detail than any other account of the games. It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level, but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd, declared the match equal, and granted both men their freedom (with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword). The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger (ad digitum), and it is possible that in this case both men raised their fingers, but Martial's emphasis here is on Titus' even-handedness and generosity in granting a reprieve (missio) to the crowd's two favourites.Coleman p. 219 His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors, as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon: it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly.Kyle p. 86 There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus, at least as names of gladiators, outside of Martial's account. A first-century graveyard in Smyrna contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus, and Verus' name is etched on a marble slab from Ferentinum, recording a gladiatorial contest. The details of Verus' fights are unfortunately not legible. While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators.Coleman p. 220 Martial's mention of gift-giving is repeated in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box at the north end of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts. Pottery fragment depicting the Thraex or Thracian gladiator (left), fighting a hoplomachus. Later events Some of Suetonius' other comments on Titus' reign mention the baths and events in the amphitheatre. Since Titus did not survive long after the end of the opening games, it is likely that these events took place during the days of the inauguration. Suetonius says that Titus promised for one day to forgo his own preferences and allow the crowd to decide the fate of the gladiators competing in the arena. He admired the Thracian gladiators, and while arguing passionately with the crowd on the subject, did not let his preferences sway him from his promise. He had some informers and their managers whipped and paraded in the arena. Some were sold as slaves in an auction and others sent away to \\"the most forbidding islands\\". Suetonius also records that Titus invited some senators, whom he had pardoned for plotting against him, to sit with him during one of the days of the games, and to inspect the swords of the gladiators, a statement that is reinforced to some degree by Dio who remarks that Titus had no senators put to death during his reign. On the last day of the games, Titus wept openly in view of the public in the amphitheatre. According to Dio, Titus died the following day, after officially dedicating the amphitheatre and the baths. Suetonius says that he had set out for the Sabine territories after the games but collapsed and died at the first posting station. Notes a. In Epigram 14 (12) Martial says that a pregnant sow was speared through the stomach and a live piglet emerged. b. In Epigram 33 Martial repeats his claim that the animals obey the Emperor. When a doe being chased by Molosian hounds kneels in front of him and is not attacked by the pursuing dogs, Martial says she and the dogs can sense Caesar's aura of power. Unfortunately the date of this epigram is in doubt, so \\"Caesar\\" could refer to either Titus or Domitian.Coleman p. 244 c. The mention of a \\"double horn\\" confirms that the rhinoceros was one of the African species: the White Rhinoceros or the Black Rhinoceros. d. The gladiators were described by their weaponry rather than their nationality, thus the \\"Thracian\\" gladiators that Titus admired may not have been from Thrace. Thracian gladiators carried small round shields and curved daggers.

It operated from 1885 as a branch from the Hutt Valley section of the Wairarapa Line, from 1915 truncated as an industrial siding.  Construction  The Hutt Park Railway was constructed to serve the Hutt Park Raceway horse racing track of the Wellington Racing Club (WRC). The WRC was in competition with the Wellington Jockey Club's track in Island Bay and sought the competitive advantage of a railway to provide easier access for patrons.Valley Signals, \\"Hutt Park Railway Company\\", accessed 12 June 2007. The first proposals for a line were made as early as 1874, not long after the first portion of the Wairarapa Line was opened to Lower Hutt, but this proposal was rejected by the 1880 Royal Commission. Nonetheless, in 1884 the Hutt Park Railway Company was formed and the 3.2-kilometre line was constructed in 38 days. Construction took place without authorisation; to resolve a legal dispute in the High Court, section 137 of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1915 legitimised the line.  Operation  The junction with the main line was at a flag station known as Beach, and the line terminated at Hutt Park, a 122-metre long platform by the western bank of the Hutt River. In the 1901 Working Timetable these two stops are called Petone Junction and Racecourse Platform respectively.New Zealand Railways Department, 1901 Working Timetable extract Trains ran whenever there was a race meeting, approximately four times a year for one or two days, from Te Aro at the end of the Te Aro Extension via Lambton Railway Station, a predecessor of Wellington railway station. They were run by the New Zealand Railways Department on behalf of the Hutt Park Railway Company and typically employed a WA class tank locomotive as motive power.  Closure  In 1906 the WRC relocated to a new track near Trentham Railway Station and the Hutt Park Railway fell into disuse. The company went into liquidation in 1918. The railway from Victoria Street to the Hutt River was lifted, while the remaining portion passed into the possession of the Gear Meat Preserving and Freezing Company as an industrial siding. Gear owned its own small locomotives to perform shunting duties. Two have been saved for preservation: former Railways Department D 137 and a Barclay 4-4-0. In November 1963 they were sold to another company and subsequently passed into the possession of the Silver Stream Railway. In 1982 Gear ceased operations and the last remnants of the Hutt Park Railway were removed.Tony Hurst, Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1995), 131.

The Petzval objective or Petzval lens is the first photographic portrait objective lens (with a 160mm focal length) in the history of photography. It was developed by the German-Hungarian mathematics professor Joseph Petzval in 1840 in Vienna, with technical advice provided by . The Voigtländer company went on to build the first Petzval lens in 1840 on behalf of Petzval, whereupon it became known throughout Europe. Later, the optical instruments maker Carl Dietzler in Vienna also produced the Petzval lens. History The Voigtländer-Petzval objective lens was revolutionary and attracted the attention of the scientific world because it was the first mathematically calculated precision objective in the history of photography. Petzval's lens established two new features: firstly, it was faster compared to previous lenses, with a maximum aperture of 1:3.6. In comparison to Daguerre's daguerreotype camera lens of 1839, Petzval's design had 22 times the light-gathering capacity, which for the first time enabled portraits under favourable conditions with exposure times of less than a minute. Additionally, Petzval calculated for the first time the composition of the lenses based on optical laws, whereas optics before had previously been ground and polished according to experience. For the calculations, 8 artillery gunners and 3 corporals were made available to Petzval by Archduke Louis of Austria (commander of the artillery), since the artillery was one of the few professions where mathematical calculations were made. By 1845 Petzval's collaboration with Voigtländer, who held the license to produce the lenses, had become \\"mired in disputes'. Voigtländer moved production outside of Austria and therefore beyond Petzval’s patent limitations. The Petzval objective was produced by Voigtländer and sold worldwide; until 1862 Voigtländer had produced 60,000 pieces. One disadvantage of Petzval's design was a sharp drop in sharpness at the edges, which was corrected in the Aplanat lens developed by .  Optical Design  The lens consisted of two doublet lenses with an aperture stop in between. The front lens is well corrected for spherical aberrations but introduces coma. The second doublet corrects for this and the position of the stop corrects most of the astigmatism. However, this results in additional field curvature and vignetting. The total field of view is therefore restricted to about 30 degrees. An f-number of 3.6 was achievable, which was considerably faster than other lenses of the time. Lens revival In 2013 Lomography successfully launched a crowdfunding campaign at kickstarter.com to produce a new Petzval lens in Russia for film and digital cameras.Kickstarter Lensbaby offers Petzval lenses for modern cameras under the Burnside and Twist names. William Optics produces a 51 mm F/4.9 (250 mm focal length) Petzval lens for astrophotography.

Alaska seen from a Satellite The state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug), Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north. 250px Because it extends into the Eastern Hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost. Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area at , over twice (roughly 2.47 times) as large as Texas, the next largest state, and is the seventh largest country subdivision in the world, and the third largest in North America, about 20.4% smaller than Denmark's autonomous country of Greenland and 17.6% smaller than Canada's largest territory of Nunavut. If the state's westernmost point were superimposed on San Francisco, California, its easternmost point would be in Jacksonville, Florida. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign nations (it is slightly larger than Iran but slightly smaller than Libya). Alaska is home to 3.5 million lakes of or larger.

Anchorage and many growing towns, such as Palmer, and Wasilla, lie within this area. Petroleum industrial plants, transportation, tourism, and two military bases form the core of the economy here. *The Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to many of Alaska's larger towns including the state capital Juneau, tidewater glaciers and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy. *Southwest Alaska is largely coastal, bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. It is sparsely populated, and unconnected to the road system, but incredibly important to the fishing industry. Half of all fish caught in the western U.S. come from the Bering Sea, and Bristol Bay has the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Southwest Alaska includes Katmai and Lake Clark national parks as well as numerous wildlife refuges. The region comprises western Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and its watersheds, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is known for wet and stormy weather, tundra landscapes, and large populations of salmon, brown bears, caribou, birds, and marine mammals. *The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines. *The Alaskan Bush is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as Nome, Bethel, Kotzebue and, most famously, Utqiagvik, the northernmost town in the United States. The northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Much of the northwest is covered by the larger National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska, which covers around . The Arctic is Alaska's most remote wilderness. A location in the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska is from any town or village, the geographic point most remote from permanent habitation in the United States. With its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000 km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula is called the Aleutian Islands. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians. For example, Unimak Island is home to Mount Shishaldin, a moderately active volcano that rises to above sea level. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. One of North America's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage. Tidal differences can be more than . (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but it has since been shown that several areas in Canada have larger tides, according to an Anchorage Daily News article dated 6/23/03.) The Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180°, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day. Land Management According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges. Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages , or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Of the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%. Alaska is administratively divided into \\"boroughs,\\" as opposed to \\"counties.\\" The function is the same, but whereas some states use a three-tiered system of decentralization -- state/county/township -- most of Alaska only uses two tiers -- state/borough. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (2000 census) 57.71 percent of Alaska's land area has this status; however, its population comprises only 13.05 percent of the state's total. For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1971 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper, and the bedroom communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird Creek, and Indian.

History The station began life in September 1994 as Country 1035, a country station broadcasting to London on medium wave. Over the next few years, successive takeovers and relaunches saw the station broadcast under the names RTL Country 1035, Ritz Radio 1035 and Mean Country 1035. In 2003, the Sunrise Radio Group acquired Mean Country 1035 and renamed the station Easy Radio. Sunrise agreed a slight change of format with the Radio Authority permitting it to reduce the proportion of pure country tracks and play more mainstream pop and rock songs that were either influenced by country music or musically compatible with it. The station's presenters during this period included Ron Brown on the breakfast show and Jack Kelly on the mid-morning programme. The programme controller was Simon Yates. In July 2004, Sunrise applied to Ofcom to change the station's format to an Asian speech station, Kismat Radio. In its submission, Sunrise claimed the country format had never been profitable, losing between £6m and £7m since launch, and had proven \\"disastrous financially\\". It also cited poor sound quality on medium wave. In addition, Sunrise pledged to maintain the Easy Radio service on DAB if its application to change the medium wave format was granted. The station had originally launched on the DRg multiplex for London in January 2002, during the Ritz Radio era. Ofcom granted Sunrise permission to change format in November 2004, and Kismat Radio took over the 1035 kHz frequency, with Easy Radio moving to DAB only, now playing a broader mix of music with some country crossover. In 2007 and 2008, Easy Radio formed part of successful applications by the DAB operator MuxCo for digital multiplexes in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, Lincolnshire, North East Wales and West Cheshire, North Yorkshire, Somerset, and Surrey and Sussex. In June 2008, live presentation by DJs ended, with the station now playing non-stop music, interspersed with jingles and hourly news bulletins from IRN. The station played a mix of pop, rock and easy listening, as well as a proportion of country tracks by mainstream artists such as Shania Twain, Dixie Chicks, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. It had 19,000 listeners a week, according to listening figures published by RAJAR for the period ending June 2008. The station closed on 28 October 2008 and was replaced on the DRg multiplex by Kismat Radio.

Its name derives from the game of pelota played at one time by Spanish soldiers stationed in Parma. History Built around 1583, during the last years of reign of Duke Ottavio Farnese, it developed around the corridor (Corridore) which connected the keep (Rocchetta, traces of which can be seen next the river Parma) to the Ducal Palace: the latter, begun in 1622 under Duke Ranuccio I, was never completed. the façade on the Piazza della Ghiaia is missing and the annexed Dominican church of St. Peter was demolished only in recent times. The existing complex includes three courts: the Cortile di San Pietro Martire (now best known as Cortile della Pilotta), Cortile del Guazzatoio (originally della pelota) and the Cortile della Racchetta. The Pilotta was to house a large hall, later turned into the Teatro Farnese, the stables and the grooms' residences, the Academy Hall and other rooms. After the end of the Farnese family rule of Parma, much of the movable assets of the palace were removed by then Duke Charles I, later King of Spain, and taken to Naples in the 1730s. The Biblioteca Palatina was established here by 1769. Elizabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain, was born here in 1692.

It is located 60 km north of Budapest in the Danube Bend, next to the Duna-Ipoly National Park. It is a favourite destination for tourists, who love the quiet and the fresh air. Due to its nice beaches, mountains, and forests, the village was nicknamed \\"The marble of the Danube Bend\\". The Szőnyi István street in the centre of the town History The town has a rich old history. By 1251 a Benedictine convent had been built in the valley of the Mill Creek. Records from the 8th century note the existence of the village. The first record of the village name dates from a letter of 1295, when it was called Zebeguen. During the Árpádházi-age, a Benedictine Monastery in the Pécs- Baranya diocese was called Szöbegény. According to the archaeologistsrecor, the Benedictines moved from Szöbegény to here and recorded the place as Zebegény. A document dated 26 September 1295 calls the Benedictine Monastery the \\"Monasterium de Zebeguennak\\" (Monastery of Zebegény). In the memos of the monastery of Saint Martin, Zebegény is noted as officially founded in the Esztergom archdiocese. In the late medieval ages, during the Turkish invasion, the village was almost destroyed. Zebegény and the area repelled the Turkish invasion around 1685. Later the population was reduced by plague. During the 18th century, the Crown recruited German farmers to populate the areas decimated by the Ottomans and restore farming along the Danube. The Germans were allowed to keep their language and religion, and became part of the group known as Danouswabians. Numerous German, Hungarian and Slavic migrants settled in the village. Records from the 19th century mention Zebegény as a German- Hungarian-Slavic village. Since the Hungarian economic transition period in the late twentieth century, the village has its own municipality. It also has an elementary school, kindergarten and a library. Since the early 1990s, Zebegény has become a popular destination among the people of Budapest. The first villas and week-end houses were built at that time. Due to its extraordinary landscape, healthy, clean air and its historic houses, the town is a favourite week-end retreat among the Budapesters. The cycling route Cultural life The cultural life (galleries, festivals, museums, sport facilities) of the village is extraordinary comparing to a normal village. Visitors can find here the Museum of István Szőnyi and the Sailing Museum of Vincze Farkas. The village organize a summer Open University of Arts since 1968. Furthermore, Zebegény has its own ski place, and a cycling route is crossing through the village. The village has a Roman Catholic church in the main square that was renovated in 2010. Landscape Zebegény lies in a magnificent natural environment: It is at the border of the Danube, under the Börzsöny hills. The village is located right next to the Duna-Ipoly National Park, where there is a rich wild life. A small, rapid creek called Mill Creek cross the village and it finally flows into the Danube. From the beach visitors are able to see the Pilis hills by viewing to the other side of the river. Within a short walk distance (around 5 km from the main square) there are three caves above the village of Zebegény that was inhabited by monks in the medieval ages. Sights *Dőry-Castle: Located at the shore of the Danube, the castle anchors the village. *Valley Bride: The seven-hole railway bridge was built in 1850, and is the second-largest rail bridge in Hungary. The Zebegény train station was built that year, in the style of the Austria- Hungary Monarchy. *Roman Catholic Church: The notable church, located in the main square, was renovated in 2010. *Trianon Memorial: It marks the territorial losses forced on Hungary under the Treaty of Trianon after World War I. *Millennium Park: Located next to the train station Transport Zebegény is easily approachable by MÁV train as it is one of the station in the Budapest-Bratislava train route. The train takes around 55 minutes from Budapest, starts daily in every hour from Budapest Nyugati train terminal. Visitors can also come by car (M2 motorway and 12 main road) from Budapest (around an hour drive). Bicycle is also an option for getting here, as a wonderful cycling route is crossing through the town (Cycling route: Budapest- Szob).

Personal life His father, Jan Poot, was Director of the (Flemish Theatre) in Brussels. Early life Born to the director (at the time) of the Royal Flemish Theatre in Brussels, Poot, although pressured to go into music from an early age by his father, was not particularly apt at the art. The following autobiographical information has been contributed by Poot himself: \\"Although I was very mediocre, I began studying music at an early age. My father had me join the clarinetists of a local band in which he was saxophonist. Less apt than my young friends, I soon had to give up this position. From then on dates my unpopularity in Vilvorde. My father, however was determined to make me a musician. We then tried the piano. The town organist, Gerard Nauwelaerts, taught me scales and the Czerny exercises. This did not amuse me at all. But the laborious study continued until I was able to play with my professor overtures by Suppe arranged for four hands. My father then decided to enroll me at the Brussels Conservatory. The first time I was turned down. But another period of work with Czerny, and I was finally admitted.\\" Education At the Brussels Conservatory, Poot studied composition and instrumentation with Arthur De Greef, José Sevenans, Martin Lunssens, Lodewijk Mortelmans, and Paul Gilson. He also attended the Antwerp Conservatory and furthered his education with Paul Dukas at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. Career After completing his studies, Poot worked firstly as a music teacher, reviewer, and freelance composer. In 1925, he and several other former students of Gilson's formed a group of musicians called Les Synthétistes, who styled themselves as a Belgian equivalent of The Mighty Five in Russia and Les Six in France. Through the group, they hoped to combine their strength and inject dynamism into an otherwise conservative Belgian musical scene, through the composition of solid contemporary pieces. Other composers who joined Les Synthétistes were René Bernier, Francis de Bourguignon, Théo De Joncker, Maurice Schoemaker, Jules Strens, and Robert Otlet. Poot was an active music commentator for fifteen years, finding a principal outlet in the magazine he co-founded with Gilson, La Revue Musicale belge. He also contributed to Le Peuple. In 1934, Poot seemed to achieve fame outside Belgium almost spontaneously after completing his Ouverture joyeuse (Joyful Overture), a work dedicated to his former teacher Paul Dukas. He also composed a substantial wind and brass oeuvre which is often played and performed by students and professionals alike. In 1939, Poot was appointed a Lecturer at the Brussels Conservatory, and later became Professor of counterpoint and harmony, before succeeding Léon Jongen as Director in 1949 and holding the post until 1966. In 1960, Poot founded the Union of Belgian Composers and became its first president. From 1963 to 1980, Poot chaired the jury of the international Queen Elisabeth Music Competition and wrote several commissioned works to mark the occasion, one of them being the \\"Concerto for Piano & Orchestra.\\" originally composed in 1959. It is rarely performed but recently received an American performance in 2007 by the Valley Symphony Orchestra (LAVC) and pianist Neil Galanter. He also served as the director of the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel between 1969 and 1976. He was elected to the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts.

His name, which means \\"Coll the left- handed\\" or \\"the crafty\\", was anglicised as Colkitto. However he only used the nickname Ciotach late in his life in 1629 when it appeared in a Latin translation of a Gaelic letter where Coll refers to himself as \\"Ego Collatius Kiotach Macdonnell\\". In Gaelic he was referred to as Coll Mac Gilleasbuig (\\"Coll the son of Archibald\\"). However in English he was normally known as \\"Coll Macgilespik\\" or a variant of this, or as \\"Coll MacDonald\\".Highland Warrior, Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars, David Stevenson. Prologue, What's in a Name?, page 2. Some English speakers concluded that \\"Coll\\" must be his military rank and that \\"Ciotach\\" was a surname. So he was also referred to as: Colonell Kittoghie, Col. Kittack, Collonell McGillespick, Colonel Coill McDonnell alias McGillespick, Col. Killa and Colonel Macdonald. Others took \\"Coll\\" or \\"Coll Ciotach\\" as places, and so they introduced \\"MacDonald of Coll\\" and \\"MacDonald of Kolkitto\\". Coll died aged 77 at Dunyvaig Castle, being executed after he was captured by Clan Campbell opponents. Family The Colonsay branch of Clan Macdonald of Dunnyveg was descended from Colla Maol Dubh (d.1558),Macdonald, D. J. Clan Donald, 1978, p.262 a notable cavalryman who was the fourth son of Alexander, 5th chief of the Macdonalds of Dunnyveg. Coll was a posthumous son of Colla Maol Dubh's eldest son, Archibald. He was born in Ireland; his birthplace is given as Loughlynch, which is in the parish of Billy, County Antrim, and his mother's name as a local O'Quinn or O'Cahan (O'Kane). Coll is sometimes stated to be a convert from Protestantism to the Catholic church, but seems to have joined it long before the first Catholic mission arrived in 1623, and was noted for his encouragement and support of Catholic interests in the region.Stevenson, Alasdair MacColla and the highland problem in the seventeenth century, 1980, p.43 The Colonsay branch of the family, although based in the Hebrides, were particularly closely involved with their kinsmen's interests in Antrim. He married Mary MacDonald of Sanda; those MacDonalds, another cadet branch of the Macdonalds of Dunnyveg, were also caught up in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and lost their position as a result of the Dunaverty Massacre. His son, Alasdair Mac Colla, was heavily involved in the wars, fighting both in Ireland and in Scotland. From his marriage with Mary MacDonald of Sanda, they had issue: *Gilleasbuig (Archibald), killed at Dunaverty Castle in 1647. *Aonghus (Angus), killed at Dunaverty Castle in 1647. *Alasdair (Alexander), married Elizabeth MacAlister, died at Battle of Knocknanauss in 1647. *Seamus (James) This family is alluded to in a sonnet of John Milton (Sonnet XI) which has a line referring to three generations: :[...]Colkitto or Macdonnel or Galasp.

Their music was principally avant-rock but also covered a variety of other genres including avant-garde jazz, contemporary classical, avant-garde, ambient and electronic. History Chris Cutler met Stevan Tickmayer in 1981 in Novi Sad in the former Yugoslavia while touring with Geoff Leigh's band, Black Sheep. Cutler came into contact with Tickmayer again in the early 1990s when Cutler's Recommended Records label in London began importing and distributing some of Tickmayer's albums. In 1991 Tickmayer moved to France and invited Cutler to work with him on the music for various choreographic productions. In 1996 Cutler suggested to Tickmayer that they make a song record using \\"science\\" texts Cutler had been developing since 1992. Cutler remarked later in a 1999 interview: Songs by Cutler on science related topics had previously been recorded by Art Bears and News from Babel, but this was to be his first album devoted exclusively with this subject matter. Using Cutler's texts, Tickmayer composed the music for a suite of songs that became the Science Group's first album, A Mere Coincidence. Tickmayer and Cutler began recording the album in May 1997 at Studio Midi Pyrenees in Caudeval, France. They invited Fred Frith (ex-Henry Cow) to join them and he added guitars to the mix. Then the ADATs recorded so far and a score were sent to Claudio Puntin in Germany who added bassclarinet. After the tapes were returned to the studio in France, Amy Denio (from Tone Dogs) joined them and sang the texts. Bob Drake (from Thinking Plague) handled all the mixing and also added bass guitar, singing and overdubbed guitars and percussion. The whole process continued on and off until January 1999 when the production work was completed. A Mere Coincidence was released later in 1999 on Cutler's Recommended Records label, with the Science Group being billed as Cutler (texts), Tickmayer (music), Drake (production), plus Frith, Puntin and Denio. The group remained dormant until 2002 when they reassembled as a quartet of Cutler, Tickmayer, Drake and Mike Johnson (from Thinking Plague) to record their second album, Spoors. It comprised four suites of purely instrumental pieces composed by Tickmayer and was released in 2003, also on Recommended Records. The Science Group never performed live, although they were invited to play at the annual Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Canada, which they had to turn down due to other commitments by some of the group members. Name The Science Group took their name from the subject matter of Chris Cutler's song texts that were used on their first album. The texts focused on science related topics, including theoretical physics, cosmology and genetic engineering. Their second album was purely instrumental, but the group retained their name for this album.

The group is better known in Germany and England than in their native United States.Gates of Slumber drop first domestic release. NUVO, May 2008. Their first release distributed within the U.S. was 2008's Conqueror, released on Profound Lore Records. History First era (1997-2013) The band was formed by Karl Simon in 1997 as The Keep with himself on vocals and bass, Jason McCash on guitar, and Chuck Brown on drums. The band released two demos, then McCash and Brown left in 1999. Simon switched to guitar, and renamed the band The Gates of Slumber. In 2000, he recruited bassist Dr. Phibes and drummer Jamie Walters. However, personality and commitment clashes led to Phibes and Walters leaving the band, leaving Simon to bring in Brad Elliott and Chris \\"The Fist\\" Gordon as replacements. This lineup was also short-lived and the original lineup of Jason McCash and Chuck Brown replaced Elliot and Gordon on bass and drums, respectfully, in 2003.The Gates of Slumber This lineup lasted until 2005, when conflicts between Brown and the rest of the band led to his departure. After being briefly replaced by a returning Gordon, the position of drummer fell to \\"Iron\\" Bob Fouts. This lineup lasted for five years between 2005 and 2010; the longest-lasting lineup in the history of the band. In 2010, Fouts was replaced by Jerry \\"Cool\\" Clyde Paradis, who was a member of the band for two years until he was replaced by the returning Fouts in 2012. Longtime member Jason McCash left the band in September 2013, and Simon and Fouts decided to dissolve the band shortly thereafter, in September 2013. Deaths and reformation (2014-present) It was announced by Karl Simon that Jason McCash had died on April 5, 2014 at age 37 from a heroin overdose, and that as a consequence of this, he would never reform The Gates of Slumber. However, in April of 2019, Simon decided to reform the band, with original drummer Chuck Brown, and new bassist Steve Janiak. Jerry Clide Paradis died in 2016 from a heat stroke. He was 46 years old. Bob Fouts died on April 28, 2020 at age 45. No cause of death was revealed.

He works for Marvel Comics, and has produced a large body of cover art, as well as promotional designs, character concepts, and interior artwork. He resides in Berlin with his wife Jelena Kevic Djurdjevic, who is also an artist and illustrator. Early life and work Djurdjević was born in Koblenz, West Germany. As a child he exhibited a talent for drawing, inspired by cartoons such as He-Man. When Marko was 11, he discovered Burne Hogarth's book Dynamic Anatomy (1958), a major turning point in his self-education. Studying the guide for two years, Djurdjevic then put the book away and began to add a layer of realism to his drawings. He used what he learned from Hogarth as a foundation, while at the same time pulling ideas from his everyday life observations. As a teenager, Djurdjević became influenced by American comic books such as Spider-Man, a foreshadowing of his later career as a Marvel Comics illustrator. He rejected the comic style of drawing a couple of years later, citing it as \\"too stylized\\" and \\"exaggerated\\", which was contrary to his training early on. At the age of 17, Marko began working professionally as an illustrator. He mostly produced black and white drawings for tabletop role- playing game companies such as White Wolf, Inc. and FanPro Games.  Conceptart.org, Massive Black, and Degenesis  Djurdjević continued working in Germany as an illustrator for the next few years, building upon his personal style which took on an almost sketch-like quality while retaining anatomical accuracy. He was convinced by a friend to begin posting some of his designs and pictures on a relatively new online art community called conceptart.org. He gained immediate recognition for his ability to conjure extremely believable figures from his imagination in a short amount of time. Djurdjević's popularity was noticed by the founding members of conceptart.org, Jason Manley and Andrew Jones. The two had been creating a network of friends through their website, and were in the process of forming a company devoted to producing concept art for videogame companies and the film industry. Djurdjević was offered a position in the group as a senior concept artist, focusing on human character and creature design. He accepted and became one of the original members of the company now known as Massive Black. Massive Black started off as a group of professionals who collaborated over the internet. As more projects developed, the company was forced to create a physical headquarters in San Francisco, California. Djurdjevic left his home country and moved to the United States, where he resided for the next 3½ years. During this time, the conceptart.org community leaders and professional instructors began to hold workshops in various locations, with the intention of teaching fledgling artists directly. This served as a way of connecting with the artistic community that the website had formed on a more intimate level. In 2004, Djurdjević was contacted by Christian Gunther to work on a post- apocalyptic themed rpg known as Degenesis. Gunther had previously released the game in 2001, but it received little attention. Gunther was hoping that a revision of the game, along with a strong artistic direction, would give the game a larger audience. Djurdjević was commissioned to design most of the game's look, as well as the bulk of its interior artwork and character designs. This project allowed Djurdjević to showcase his ability to create original, yet believable worlds on a large scale. He quickly became associated with the style of the characters in the game, with their asymmetrical designs, horrific themes, and focus on gesture. Marko often stated that the post- apocalyptic genre was his favorite genre to work in.  X-Men Re-designs, Character Ideation, and Marvel  Example of Djurdjević's work, from the cover of Amazing Spider-Man #642. Djurdjević continued to work in California as a concept artist for the next few years. The founders of the conceptart.org website decided to start developing tutorial DVDs that could be sold to the general public. Djurdjević was asked to be the first artist to produce a DVD, and he accepted. Around this time, Djurdjević (at the urging of his friend Nic Klein), re-created 18 characters of the X-Men. The characters were eventually discovered by an editor working at Marvel Comics, and they contacted Djurdjević and offered him an exclusive contract to produce illustrations for some of their title's covers. He accepted the offer after producing a test cover for the series X-23. At the end of 2006, Massive Black released the DVD Character Ideation.

Carbon-14 datings estimated an age between 13,300 and 14,000 years. A study of the mitochondrial genome sequences in 2013 showed that the animal is indeed Canis lupus familiaris, not a wolf. Oberkassel was first mentioned as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel refers to a Roman fortification; in the course of time \\"Romerkastell\\" (Roman castle) became \\"Oberkassel\\". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned for the first time in 873), Büchel (mentioned for the first time in 1202), Broich (mentioned for the first time in 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned for the first time in 1442).

Josef Pischna was born at Iang Lhot Bohemia in 1826. In 1847 he graduated from the Royal Conservatory at Prague as an oboe player, however, as in all Continental schools, he was liged to study piano in addition to tire orchestra instrument. He also had the thorough training in harmony; counterpoint, musical history, etc., which is demanded before the student is permitted to graduate. Consequently, although he lost his identity in the orchestras in which he performed, he really was a very able and well trained musician. From Prague he went to Odessa, Russia, and became the conductor of a military band. Hence he moved to Moscow, where he became Professor of Music in the endowed institute for young ladies of noble birth. There he remained for thirty-five years, playing piano practically all of this time. It was there that he had an opportunity to try his technical exercises.

The Ulster is distinguished from the Inverness by the length of the cape; in the Ulster, this cape only reaches the elbows, allowing free movement of the forearms. It was commonly worn by coachmen who would be seated outdoors in bad weather for long periods, but needed to use their arms to hold reins. Often made of hard-wearing fabrics, such as herringbones or tweeds, it was not a formal coat at the time, though in the 20th century a cape would be seen as such. After the Edwardian period, it lost its cape, and continued to be used as a heavy-duty overcoat, often in a double-breasted style. A lightweight version of this coat is called an ulsterette. Origins Prior to the inception of the Ulster coat in the first half of the nineteenth century, the greatcoat or surtout was the main component of a gentleman’s wardrobe. Whilst fashionable at the time, these garments proved to be very cumbersome for travel due to the heavy lengths of overlapping cloth involved in creating the silhouette. By the mid-1800s, these coats were replaced by lighter variations such as the Chesterfield Overcoat and the Albert. These coats were designed primarily for show, so did not amount to the same level of weather protection. John McGee of McGee & Co set about creating a coat that would fulfil this purpose. By 1866, McGee had conceptualised the coat known as the ‘Ulster.’ The design was met with much attention upon its introduction and brought acclaim to the Irish designer. Due to the increased sales from the popular coat, the company invested in a second location in Belfast, known simply as the ‘Ulster Coat Warehouse.’ The success of the male coat eventually led to a public clamouring for the female version. And so in the early 1870s, an ulster coat for women was introduced to the market. In fiction It is often seen in period productions of Victorian novels, such as those of Charles Dickens and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The Ulster coat was referred to in Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, A Scandal in Bohemia, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle and The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor. It has become a signifier in a great many late-Victorian costume dramas since. In the Sherlock Holmes short story Blue Carbuncle for example, Watson recounts that: “It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats.” The novel, The Lodger, by Marie Belloc-Lowndes features the infamous Victorian criminal Jack the Ripper stalking the streets of Whitechapel wearing an ulster coat. This was later replicated in the film adaption of the book by 20th Century Fox, where the villain played by Laird Cregar is seen burning an ulster coat in the fire after committing a murderous crime. The coat also features briefly in James Joyce’s novel, Dubliners. In the story ‘Grace,’ the character of Mr. Power is wearing a ulster coat when he approaches the drunk Mr. Kernan: “a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, (coming) from the far end of the bar…” See also * Inverness coat References Category:Coats (clothing) Category:Formal wear ","title":"Ulster coat"},{"id":"11730582","text":"Jayson S.

It is located at Jalan Muzaffar Shah formerly Creagh Road, Assam Kumbang and also called Tekah Airstrip. The airport was built in early 1929, this wooden structure aerodrome was the first airfield in the state of Perak and also in Peninsular Malaysia. Taiping Airport is the oldest airstrip in Malaysia. It was built by the British in 1929 for non-military use. Along with Alor Star Airport which was built in the same year, it was one of the earliest airports in Malaya. However, in 1933 more airports were built in Singapore, Selangor and Penang, and the Taiping Airport was no longer important. In February 2007, the airport was chosen to be the hub for the Global Flying Hospitals, GFH. However, in July 2007, it was decided that Taiping Airport was not suitable as the flying hub, and the Chairman of GFH, Neill Newton, announced a new location will be selected, but not in Malaysia. History The Taiping Airport which is located in Assam Kumbang also called Tekah Airport. The airport was built in 1929 and claimed as the first airport officially established in Federated Malay States and also in South East Asia. The airport was not as important when compared to other airports that were established after the first at Taiping. Besides, serving as a commercial airport for the use of the British officers and European merchants it also served as the airstrip for the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF). The airport served short distance destinations such as to Alor Star, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. The Penang to Singapore flight routes runs a daily stop by at the Taiping Airport. The first Malaya airway company, the Wearne Air Service Company made a daily flight to Taiping, to deliver newspapers to the town. After the end of the Japanese Occupation flight to other Malay states were cancelled and the airport only served flights to other airports within th Perak state, and only the Ipoh Airport was authorized to serve flights to other states. The airport also achieved fame through the famous American aviator, Amelia Earhart in 1937, when she was doing her world flight. Amelia Earhart was flying between Thailand and Singapore and permission to land at Taiping Airport was granted on 7 June 1937 by the then Resident-General of Malaya. The airport also marked was significant in the history of Malaysia, when Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta later became the President and Vice-President of Indonesia landed at the airport on 12 August 1945 for a meeting with Dr. Burhanuddin al-Helmy and Ibrahim Yaakub who were leaders of a political party named KRIS to talk about the possibility of joining Malaya with Indonesia, when Indonesia achieved independence. The meeting was arranged by the Japanese officers during the World War II. However, the plan was never succeed and Indonesia announced its independence without Malaya. In February 2007, the Chief State Minister of Perak, Datuk Seri Tajol Rosli Mohd Ghazali announced that the airport had been chosen as the hub for Global Flying Hospitals (GHF), which is an international organization that brings humanitarian medical support to developing nations. Unfortunately, the plan was not carried out, because the runway at the airport was too short (about 200 feet long) to accommodate the GFH’s planes, as the GFH is using the A320 Airbus. The GFH is now stationed at the Subang Airport. On 22 August 2014, a military helicopter EC725 Super Cougar owned by Royal Malaysian Air Force which bring a funeral victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 arrived and landed safely in Taiping Airport at 12:35 PM for the burial of the victims at Al-Hidayah Muslim Cemetery.

It plays a similar playlist to The Breeze with classic hits. The station has one local drive time show, hosted by the former Breeze presenter Tony Wright.  The Breeze South Devon  The Breeze South Devon was the independent radio station for Torbay and South Devon, which formed a part of The Breeze network. Before this, the station was originally called Palm 105.5 until September 2015, following its acquisition the year previous. The station now only consists of one local drive time show, hosted by the former Breeze presenter Tony Wright. History Palm FM was set up in 1998 and was the first to run a Restricted Service Licence in the area. In 1994, Jo Corben- Richards (aka CJ Munroe), former Senior Producer/Presenter for DevonAir Radio, applied for a Restricted Service Licence specifically for the Torbay area with the backing of local lawyer and property developer, Roger Richards and local businesswoman Julia Milton-Head. Whilst at DevonAir, CJ had tried to persuade them to maintain an opt-out radio service for the Torbay area. Permission for an RSL was initially granted by the Radio Authority, but subsequently objected to by the owners of Exeter/Torbay licence, Gemini FM. In 1997, CJ and Roger gained further support from local businessmen and the like to proceed with the development of a local radio service for Torbay. First RSL Palm FM's first Restricted Service Licence was launched by the Mayor of Torquay, Vincent McCann in December 1998. The broadcast was set up to cover the annual Torbay Carnival and Christmas celebrations; they also broadcast extensive outside broadcasts from schools and a live Midnight Mass from St. Matthias Church in Wellswood. Second RSL A second 28-day broadcast was made from August 1999 to coincide with the eclipse; the station was even designated the \\"Official Eclipse Station\\" by Sir Patrick Moore, who involved himself with the Palm's output. Outside broadcasts during this period included a South West Musical Festival from the Quay West holiday Complex in Paignton. A new logo was designed by local students and a winner was picked by the listeners. The area's tourist industry was promoted by a locally written and Palm FM produced CD which was distributed by W.H. Smiths. Great Britain's largest recognised talent competition \\"Stairway to the Stars\\" was sponsored by Palm FM and featured CJ as Senior Judge. Third RSL Palm FM returned to the airwaves in May 2000, again under the guidance of CJ. During this period, Palm FM continued to lobby for the Torbay area to be added to the Radio Authority's \\"working list\\" for proposed new services. Between the last two RSLs, Palm FM commissioned two separate in-depth independent research initiatives for the proposed permanent station, the results were forwarded to the Authority. 2000 onwards Station Director, Brian Houghton died, his wife continued his support and investment in the company. Julia Milton-Head left the company for health reasons, but also retained her investment. In 2002, Carlton Westcountry presenter Kate Reeves expressed her interest and later joined the Board. After the RSLs, John Brocks was appointed as Project Director to apply for a full-time license. Dr. Avtar Lit and Palm Radio Ltd agreed to apply for the Torbay Licence, Managing Director of London Media Company, Neil Romain joined the Board of the newly formed Palm FM Limited with his colleague David Lowen, a media consultant and former head of news for ITV Westcountry. LMC now provide financial and administrative support while allowing the local Board to operate, broadcast and develop. In September 2005, and after ten years of campaigning, Palm was awarded the licence. Sale and rebranding to The Breeze Celador Radio acquired Palm FM on 22 August 2014 from Palm Radio Ltd for the remaining 40% which was not owned. On 21 September 2015, Palm 105.5 was rebranded as The Breeze and became part of The Breeze Network References External links * GHR Devon * Ofcom.org.uk - Licence application. * Ofcom.org.uk - Sample report.

The hot engine transfers heat to the oil which then usually passes through a heat-exchanger, typically a type of radiator known as an oil cooler. The cooled oil flows back into the hot object to cool it continuously. Usage Oil cooling is commonly used to cool high- performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, oil cooling requires additional oil capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an oil cooler (or a larger cooler than normal). If air-cooling proves sufficient for much of the running time (such as for an aero-engine in flight, or a motorcycle in motion), then oil cooling is an ideal way to cope with those times when extra cooling is needed (such as an aero-engine taxying before take-off, or a motorcycle in a city traffic jam). But if the engine is a racing engine that is always producing huge amounts of heat, water or liquid cooling may be preferable. Air-cooled aviation engines may be subject to \\"shock cooling\\" when descending from cruising altitude prior to landing. During descent, very little power is needed, so the engine is throttled back and thereby develops much less heat than when maintaining altitude. While descending, the plane's airspeed rises, substantially increasing the rate of air-cooling the engine. These factors may cause the cylinder head to crack; but the adoption of oil-cooled cylinder heads significantly reduces or cancels the problem as the heads are now \\"oil- warmed\\". In the 1980s, Suzuki used the \\"SACS\\" oil-cooling system on the GSX-R sportbikes, but later switched to water-cooling. The Wankel engine features oil cooling in addition to liquid-cooling to successfully manage its excessive heat. This rotary engine is most famous for its application in the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8. Splash lubrication is a rudimentary form of oil cooling. Some slow- turning early engines would have a \\"splashing spoon\\" beneath the big end of the connecting rod. This spoon would dip into sump oil and would hurl oil about, in the hope of cooling and lubricating the underside of the piston. Advantages * Oil has a higher boiling point than water, so it can be used to cool items at a temperature of 100 °C or higher. However, pressurised water-cooling may also exceed 100 °C. * Oil is an electrical insulator, thus it can be used inside of or in direct contact with electrical equipment such as in transformers. * Oil is already present as a lubricant, so no extra coolant tanks, pumps nor radiators are required (although all of these items may need to be larger than otherwise). * Cooling water can be corrosive to the engine and must contain a Corrosion inhibitor/rust-inhibitor, whereas oil naturally helps to prevent corrosion. * Thus, if through a gasket failure, coolant oil should enter, say, the combustion chamber or the sump, this would be a mere inconvenience; but if coolant water should similarly leak, substantial engine damage might occur. Disadvantages * Coolant oil may be limited to cooling objects under approximately 200–300 °C, otherwise the oil may degrade and even leave ashy deposits. * Pure water may evaporate or boil, but it cannot degrade, although it may become polluted and acidic. * Water is generally available should coolant need to be added to the system, but oil may not be. * Unlike water, oil may be flammable. * The specific heat of water or water/glycol is about twice that of oil, so a given volume of water may absorb more engine heat than can the same volume of oil. * Therefore, water may be a better coolant if an engine is permanently producing large amounts of heat, making it better for high-performance or racing engines.

The phrase is used to invoke a stereotype of shallow, leisured, upper-class toffs (tennis is often seen as a posh game for the rich, with courts popular at country clubs and private estates). It's a stereotypical entrance or exit line given to a young man of this class in a superficial drawing-room comedy. A close paraphase of the saying, was used in George Bernard Shaw's 1914 drawing-room comedy Misalliance, in which Johnny Tarleton asks \\"Anybody on for a game of tennis?\\" (An 1891 story in the satirical magazine Punch put a generally similar notion in the mouth of a similar type of character: \\"I’m going to see if there’s anyone on the tennis-court, and get a game if I can. Ta-ta!\\".) \\"Anyone for tennis?\\" is particularly associated with the early career of Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart. At the start of his career, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Bogart appeared in many Broadway plays in what Jeffrey Meyers characterized as \\"charming and fatuous roles – in [one of] which he is supposed to have said 'Tennis, anyone?'\\". If Bogart ever did speak the line, it would have presumably been in the 1925 play Hell's Bells, set at the Tanglewood Lodge in New Dauville, Connecticut. Bogart claimed that his line in the play was \\"It's forty-love outside. Anyone care to watch?\\", and that indeed is what is printed in the script. However, according to Darwin Porter, director John Hayden crossed out that line and replaced it with \\"Tennis anyone?\\" before opening night. And several observers have asserted that he did say it, reportedly including Louella Parsons and Richard Watts Jr.. Erskine Johnson, in a 1948 interview, reports Bogart as saying \\"I used to play juveniles on Broadway and came bouncing into drawing rooms with a tennis racket under my arm and the line: 'Tennis anybody?' It was a stage trick to get some of the characters off the set so the plot could continue.\\" But Bogart's usual stance was denial of using that precise phrase (\\"The lines I had were corny enough, but I swear to you, never once did I have to say 'Tennis, anyone?'\\"), although averring that it did characterize generally some of his early roles. The phrase continued to drift through popular culture in the 20th century and, to a diminished extent, into the 21st. It appears in the lyric of the \\"Beautiful Girl Montage\\" in the classic 1952 musical movie Singin' in the Rain, and in the lyric and title of the song \\"Anyone for Tennis\\" by the British rock band Cream, which was the theme song of the film The Savage Seven. The stage play Anyone for Denis? riffs on the name, as does the television series Anyone for Tennyson?; Daffy Duck used the phrase in the cartoons Rabbit Fire, Drip-Along Daffy and The Ducksters, and so forth.

It is an Anglophone congregation located very near its partner parish, the Francophone Église Sacré-Cœur. History The parish was founded in 1856 by missionaries from the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The church was built on what was believed to be the resting places of many labourers killed in the construction of the Rideau Canal. In 1828, Lieutenant-Colonel John By granted land (most of today's Sandy Hill) to one of his lieutenants, René Léonard Besserer. Besserer died in March 1823, and his older brother Louis-Théodore Besserer was his heir. Louis Besserer immediately set to work dividing Sandy Hill into lots, however those lots proved difficult to sell due to the sandy and unproductive land, and the lack of churches, schools and business. By 1845, Besserer transferred six of these lots over to the Roman Catholic Church for them to establish a church and a college. On this land was built the first Saint Joseph's Church, and the re-located College of Ottawa. On 29 August 1856 Saint Joseph's Parish was founded. In 1857, Rev. Damase Dandurand, a Roman Catholic priest and member of the Oblate Order, designed St. Joseph's \\"near the College in St. George's Ward\\", which was styled in a \\"Rustico-Tuscan order\\". Rev. Damase Dandurand The first church was not consecrated until 19 March 1858. The building was a small traditional stone church with few notable architectural features, other than a clock above the door, and the first church bells in Ottawa. It could seat 230 parishioners on its 92 benches. Following the naming of Ottawa as the capital and the subsequent transfer of a few hundred civil servants to Ottawa, many of those civil servants began to attend Saint Joseph's. As a result of this, it was decided that the church was too small, and in 1866 two transepts were added. Those two transepts added 138 new benches, bringing the total number of benches up to 230. The congregation continued to grow. In 1889, the church's French community built their own church. Despite the building of the Église Sacré-Cœur (which is still standing just across Laurier) and the 100 families that left Saint Joseph's, the old church was still too small for the ever- growing congregation, and on 23 April 1890, the Superior General of the Oblates authorised the preparation of plans for a new church. The last mass was held at the original Saint Joseph's in February 1892. On 23 January 1892, a contract was signed with William Edward Doran of Montreal to build the second church on Wilbrod Street at Cumberland Street 1892-93.William Edward Doran Construction began four months later, and the cornerstone ceremony was held on 26 June 1892. The new church was dedicated on 19 November 1893, and could seat 1100 people. The second church was 62’ high, 192’ long, 75’ wide (expanding to 105’ at the transepts), and had a 192’ tall tower. The church was built in the Roman Renaissance style, and was decorated in a way that was similar to Notre Dame. One notable detail of the construction is that the foundation was well enough built that it was able to be reused when the current church was built. The second church survived for 37 years before it was destroyed by fire on the night of 27 December 1930. Work on the third church was commenced shortly after the fire. Not only was the church built on the foundations of the second church, parts of the exterior wall up to the stained glass windows were retained. In rebuilding the church, the architectural style was changed from Roman Renaissance to Neo-Gothic, and in order to make the building more fire-resistant, Father Finnegan replaced the varnished wooden walls with bare cement brick walls. On 4 January 1932, then archbishop Guillaume Forbes of Ottawa consecrated the marble altar. It is this third church that still stands today. Two brass plaques were erected by the St Joseph's Parish in honour of those parishioners who served with the allied forces in World War I, many of whom laid down their lives. A memorial framed scroll with the names of all members of St. Joseph\`s parish who volunteered for active service with Canada\`s fighting forces in the Second World War and a Memorial Book with short biographies of those members who gave their lives were erected by the St Joseph\`s parish. The current pastor is Fr. Jim Bleackley, OMI, replacing the former pastor, Fr. Richard Beaudette, OMI, who in turn succeeded Fr. Andy Boyer in October 2015.

S. Van Dyke and released by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It is based on the books Der Eskimo and Die Flucht ins weisse Land by Danish explorer and author Peter Freuchen. The film stars Ray Mala as Mala, Lulu Wong Wing as Mala's first wife Aba, Lotus Long as Mala's second wife Iva, Peter Freuchen as the Ship Captain, W. S. Van Dyke as Inspector White, and Joseph Sauers as Sergeant Hunt. Eskimo was the first feature film to be shot in a Native American language (Inupiat), although the AFI Catalog of Feature Films lists several earlier features shot in Alaska beginning in the later teens with The Barrier (1917 film), The Girl Alaska (1919), Back to God's Country (1919 film), and Heart of Alaska (1924). Eskimo documented many of the hunting and cultural practices of Native Alaskans. The production for the film was based at Teller, Alaska, where housing, storage facilities, a film laboratory, and other structures were built to house the cast, crew, and equipment. Eskimo was nicknamed \\"Camp Hollywood\\" with a crew that included 42 cameramen and technicians, six airplane pilots, and Emil Ottinger — a chef from the Roosevelt Hotel. Numerous locations were used for filming, including Cape Lisburne in March 1933, Point Hope and Cape Serdtse- Kamen in April to July, and Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea in July. The film crew encountered difficulties recording native speech due to the \\"kh\\" sound of the native language. Altogether, pre-production, principal photography, and post-production took 17 months. The motion picture was well received by critics upon release on 14 November 1933, and received the first-ever Oscar for Best Film Editing, although it didn't fare well at the box office. Scholar Peter Geller has more recently criticized the film as depicting the Eskimo as childlike, simple, and mythic \\"noble savages\\" rather than as human beings. Plot Mala is a member of an unspecified Eskimo tribe living in Alaska. He has a wife, Aba, and two children. As he and the villagers welcome a hunter from another village, they hunt walrus, and celebrate. Mala learns of white traders at nearby Tjaranak Inlet. He desperately wants rifles, and Aba longs for sewing needles and other white men's goods. Mala and Aba travel by dog sled to the trading ship with their children, and encounter an old friend whose wife died about a month before. Mala offers his friend to have sex with a willing Aba, which comforts their friend, and they part ways contentedly. When they meet the white ship captain, he exchanges Mala's tanned animal skins for a rifle. The captain demands that Aba spend the night with him and gets her drunk, and has sex with her. Mala demands that the captain promises him that Aba will not be molested again. Mala and the Eskimos go bowhead whale hunting in wooden boats with harpoons, and an actual whale hunt and carcass butchering is depicted. After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba and the ship captain rapes her. Aba staggers away still drunk at dawn. The Captain's Mate disgusted by the captain's betrayal, is hunting seals. He mistakes Aba for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship's captain with a harpoon, mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife. He flees to his village. Lonely and needing someone to care for his children, Mala asks the hunter if his wife Iva can help with sewing hides. Mala still longs for Aba, and, though Iva moves in with him, their relationship is cold. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and shooting them with bow and arrow and spears. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer, he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala befriended decides to return to his village and gives Kripik his other wife in gratitude, who is delighted to live with Iva and Mala. Many years pass. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police establishes a post at Tjaranak, bringing law to the area. Several white men accuse the Eskimos of being savage and without morals and charge Mala with the murder of the ship's captain. Sergeant Hunt and Constable Balk try to find Mala and arrest him but nearly freeze to death in a blizzard. Kripik saves their lives and is hostile toward the men until Hunt explains that they do not want Kripik's wives. The Mounties believe Mala is dead, but Akat arrives in the village and unintentionally exposes Kripik. The Mounties convince Kripik to answer questions, and several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik freedom, but Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders committed on the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves to new hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind. They starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost and demands that Kripik not be allowed to hunt and chains him at night. During the night, Kripik mangles his hand while attempting to escape. He flees the post and heads for his family's old village. Hunt and Balk pursue him. Kripik kills his sled dogs for food. In a driving blizzard, Kripik is attacked and injured by a wolf, which he kills. He is rescued by his eldest son Orsodikok. The Mounties arrive the next morning, and Kripik prevents Orsodikok from killing them. The Mounties say he must leave and never come back. Kripik departs on foot, but Iva goes with him. The Mounties pursue them across the ice, which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot because Kripik had saved their lives. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and both will be able to return to Orsodikok next spring. Cast Following is a list of the cast members: * Ray Mala as Mala/Kripik * Lulu Wong Wing as Aba * Lotus Long as Iva * Iris Yamaoka as the Second Wife * Peter Freuchen as Ship Captain * Edward Hearn as Captain's Mate * W. S. Van Dyke as Inspector White * Joseph Sauers as Sergeant Hunt * Edgar Dearing as Constable Balk Production Script and casting The script for Eskimo was based on books by Danish explorer and author Peter Freuchen. W.S. Van Dyke was assigned by MGM to direct, but it was not a film which Van Dyke was interested in doing. He wrote to his uncle, John Charles Van Dyke, on May 24, 1932, \\"Am going to film Peter Freuchen's book Eskimo. Don't fancy the job a damn bit, but it brings in the bread and butter.\\" Van Dyke intended the picture to depict the corrupting influence white culture had on the Eskimos, much as he had done in White Shadows in the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film. Both Stromberg and Van Dyke wanted the Native Alaskans in the film to speak in their native tongue. However, MGM production chief Irving Thalberg worried that intertitles were too distracting and would seem old-fashioned, and Stromberg agreed. By this time, however, it was September 1932. To refilm the shot scenes in English would be prohibitively expensive, and Stromberg changed his mind so that intertitles (not subtitles) were used in the final film to translate the Inupiat language into English. Stromberg demanded complete authenticity in casting, language, and the depiction of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later changed his name to Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume. According to Peter Freuchen, MGM considered filming in Greenland, where Freuchen's novels were set. But the difficult weather and bright summer light (which made filming difficult) dissuaded them, and the production settled on Alaska instead. Freuchen accompanied the production not only as an actor, but as an interpreter as well. Principal photography and filming locations Ray Mala, the star of Eskimo. The start of production is not clear. A commercial transport ship, the Victoria, took the cast and crew from Seattle, Washington, to Nome, Alaska. There, the schooner Nanuk was rented by the studio to take the production team farther north. Originally known as the Pandora, the schooner would next be used in the 1935 production of Mutiny on the Bounty, and rerigged for the 1937 film Maid of Salem. The Nanuk acted as a mobile base of operations, and as a set for the shipboard scenes. MGM bought the schooner outright during the production. On-screen credits for the film claim filming began in April 1932, but The Hollywood Reporter said it began in July and the New York Times said June. The production had its land-based home at Teller, Alaska. Housing, storage facilities, a film laboratory, and other structures were built to house the cast, crew, and equipment, and the cast nicknamed the site \\"Camp Hollywood\\". The crew included 42 cameramen and technicians, six airplane pilots, and Emil Ottinger — a chef from the Roosevelt Hotel. The production took (0.32 metric tonnes) of food with them to Alaska, as well as medical supplies, a mobile film processing laboratory, and sound recording equipment. Many native people ate bacon, corn flakes, and oranges for the first time, and became enamored of the food. Film was flown out of Teller back to Los Angeles every seven or eight weeks. There are varying accounts about how much danger the production encountered during the 1932–33 winter season. The Hollywood Reporter said in October 1932 that the Nanuk was caught in the ice off Alaska and sled dog teams had to be used to rescue the film crew. However, crew on the film noted that the Nanuk wintered in Grantley Harbor at Teller. A press release by MGM in November 1932 claimed that the Nanuk reported via radio that it was frozen in the sea ice and drifting with 35 people aboard, unable to continue shooting until the spring. A report by the New York Times in February 1933 also claimed the Nanuk was locked in sea ice between Teller and Barrow. Peter Freuchen also relates that the Nanuk was blown off course by heavy winds several times. Filming locations varied widely. Scenes of Eskimo villages on the ice, and some of the polar bear footage (not used), were shot on sea ice off Cape Lisburne, Alaska, in March 1933. For this set, separate camera houses were built some distance away from the igloo sets, and accessed via tunnel below the snow. At one point, a sudden warm spell melted the igloos the production set up to house cast and cameras. Some interior and other shots were filmed on sets at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. At one point, most of the Native Alaskans in the film went on strike. They were paid $5 per day for being extras, participating in hunts or tribal ceremonies, or for acting in minor roles. Although this was a large sum for Alaska at the time, many decided to strike for $10 or $15 a day. Van Dyke immediately hired strikebreakers from among the other native people as replacements, and the strike ended. Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is credited with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot a few of the scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air. Because Native Alaskan languages are somewhat staccato in nature and makes heavy of the \\"kh\\" sound, sound recordists initially had trouble recording native speech. The \\"kh\\" sound overwhelmed the microphones (a problem known as \\"chopping\\"), which would then not pick up the following sounds. Significant adjustments were made in order to correct the problem. Hunting and wolf attack scenes Locals harpooning a whale from ice floes near Point Barrow, Alaska, in 1935. A whale hunt from boats was depicted in the film Eskimo. The scenes of walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for caribou, polar bear, walrus, and whale occur at the same time, the production was forced to spend more than a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) in order to get the necessary footage. The walrus and polar bear hunts were filmed in July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus carcasses were used as dog food and to attract polar bears. Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage made it into the picture. According to Peter Freuchen, the scene in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with a rock and a pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a telephoto lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack. Post-production Principal production appears to have ended about March 25, 1933. Van Dyke was back aboard a commercial ship, headed for California, while Frank Messenger (aboard the Nanuk) continued to shoot second unit footage for the next month or two. In the summer of 1933, MGM staff realized that additional footage was needed to complete the film. This involved casting an actress for the role. The production staff visited San Francisco, California, to identify an actress for a minor female part. Ray Mala offered the role of Iva to Sadie Brower, a 17-year-old half-Inupiat girl. But after Brower's father refused to let her appear in movies, Lotus Long, an actress of mixed Japanese and Hawaiian ancestry (who could not speak any Eskimo), was cast in the role instead. According to Brower, Long's Eskimo was bad enough as to be unintelligible. Dortuk, Elik, Kemasuk, Nunooruk, and four other Inupiat actors were brought to California to act in the reshoots and new scenes. William Axt is credited with the musical score. However, some of Modest Mussorgsky's \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" may be heard on the soundtrack when the Eskimos go off to hunt whales. Altogether, pre-production, principal photography, and post-production took 17 months. The total cost of the picture was reported variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. To recoup its costs, MGM kept the film in circulation for many years. The running time of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major cuts were made afterward, however. The final running time for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes. Premieres and critical reception Premieres Eskimo premiered at the Astor Theatre in New York City on November 14, 1933. MGM did not promote the film as a tale of colonial corruption or revenge, but rather played up its sexual motifs. The studio placed large neon signs on Broadway Avenue declaring \\"Eskimo Wife Traders! Weird Tale of the Arctic!\\" Lobby cards in theaters contained lurid descriptions: \\"The strangest moral code on the face of the earth — men who share their wives but kill if one is stolen!\\" MGM more appropriately advertised Eskimo as \\"the biggest picture ever made\\". The film did not do well at the domestic box office, however. As one film scholar put it, \\"The film's adventurous scenes were certainly impressive, but few Americans would be stirred by Inupiat survival in the far north.\\" To boost receipts, MGM changed the film's title to Eskimo Wife-Traders. But the change did not help, and MGM lost $236,000 on the film domestically. The film was released in the UK and Australia as Mala the Magnificent. The UK premiere was on October 20, 1934, and the Australian premiere on October 31, 1934. Critical reception Conrad A. Nervig won the very first Oscar for Best Film Editing for his work on Eskimo. Mordaunt Hall, writing for the New York Times in 1933, generally praised the picture. The script managed to sustain interest in the various scenes, he was surprised to find moments of \\"genuinely effective comedy\\", and he found the acting by native people \\"really extraordinary\\". He singled out Ray Mala, Lulu Wong Wing, and Lotus Long for being particularly effective in conveying emotion. He also found the use of native language and realistic sounds (recorded in Alaska) one of the film's best elements. However, Hall felt the picture was a bit long, and various hunting scenes (although often thrilling) were too reminiscent of many such scenes in previous motion pictures. Other reviews were also generally positive, but nearly all critics compared the film to other motion pictures (such as Igloo and Nanook of the North) which had also captured exquisite scenery and scenes of Inupiat people. To many critics of the day, the footage of tribal customs and hunting actually made Eskimo a documentary film rather than a drama. Scholar Peter Geller has more recently criticized the film as depicting the Eskimo as childlike, simple, and mythic \\"noble savages\\" rather than as human beings. However, others thought it portrayed them as realistic human beings with feelings. Film historian Thomas P. Doherty concludes that the picture favors scenery and typecasting over real characters. Eskimo was not the first dramatic film to use an all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film In the Land of the Head Hunters and some would argue Hiawatha (1913 film). Eskimo was, however, the first motion picture filmed in the language of a Native American people, and one of the early features shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became known for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood, mostly in movie serials and B movies. Box office The film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,312,000: $636,000 in the US and Canada and $676,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $236,000.

He is played by Laurence Fox. Hathaway holds the rank of Detective Sergeant until the penultimate series of Lewis in 2014, in which he is promoted to the rank of Inspector following a brief break from the police. Biography Childhood and family Hathaway grew up at \\"Crevecoeur Hall\\", an Oxford estate where his father was estate manager (\\"The Dead of Winter\\"). Hathaway attended Cambridge and is a former Catholic seminarian. In the episode, \\"Wild Justice\\", Hathaway is offered a junior lectureship in theology. He expresses some interest in taking up teaching if Lewis were to retire. In the first episode of series 3 there is slight reference to Hathaway's childhood. When his father is mentioned he becomes rather irritable and changes the subject rather quickly. In the first episode of series 4 it is mentioned that Hathaway's father was the estate manager at the estate of a lord and that Hathaway used to play with the other children who lived at the estate. Later in the episode it is revealed that the Lord of the manor has been systematically abusing young children living on the estate but whether or not Hathaway has been one of his victims or has been aware of what went on is not discussed. In the same Lewis episode Lewis and Hathaway deal with a difficult case involving a complex family relationship. The eventual outcome is difficult for Hathaway to digest, leading to conjecture that he may himself have some experience in the subject matter. This links back to \\"Life born of Fire\\", where Jonjo a former friend of Hathaway's asserts his friend is not happy with his life. Something in Hathaway is always questioning his desires with his duties. We meet Philip Hathaway in the prequel show, Endeavour, episode 3 series 3, where a young Philip Hathaway is introduced as a groundsman, at the same Crevecoeur estate. It throws light on his father's passion for fishing, as that would have been a groundsman's way to relax on a huge estate. Season nine introduces Hathaway's family properly. We meet his father Philip who is suffering from dementia and his sister Nell with whom James has a tense relationship. It is also revealed that Hathaway's mother has been dead since before the show started. Hathaway's relationship with his family is fraught but Lewis serves as a link helping him to at least partially connect with his ailing father as they go fishing together and Lewis encourages James to allow himself to hold his father's hand even though this is not how they usually express their emotions. Education Hathaway, like Inspector Morse, Lewis' old boss from his days as a Detective Sergeant, is cerebral. Unlike Morse, Hathaway trained in Theology, and was a rather successful athlete, as his nickname 'Atta-way Hathaway' (revealed by a rival coach at Oxford) would attest, being a rowing star while at Cambridge. In the last episode of series 5 Hathaway informs Lewis that he was talent spotted for MI5 in university; this is neither confirmed nor denied by the end. In \\"The Soul of Genius\\", the first episode of series 6, it is hinted that Hathaway is well known in the Oxford theology faculty. Rev. Conor Hawes shows interest in Hathaway after he makes a comment on the subject he is discussing with Lewis, asking with a curious look, \\"What did you say your name was?\\" To which Hathaway replies, \\"Detective Sergeant Hathaway\\" with some coldness in his tone. He subsequently trained for the priesthood in Oxford and entered the seminary. He later left the seminary guilty over the orthodox but ultimately deadly advice he gave a gay friend about coping with his homosexuality. This was detailed in the third episode of the second series (\\"Life Born of Fire\\"), unlike Lewis, Hathaway's guilt at sharing the homophobic attitudes of some of his fellow trainees is revealed when he discovers that a suicide he is investigating is a former friend, Will McEwan, who broke off his friendship with him when Hathaway urged him to reject his homosexuality and that he would be punished by God for it. Hathaway acknowledges that he was blinded by religion and did not realize how he hurt Will. In the episode \\"Old School Ties\\" we are told by an ex-schoolmate of Hathaway's that he had been Head Boy of his \\"posh\\" school and nicknamed 'W.C.' - short for 'Wolfgang Christ' - because he \\"didn't know whether he wanted to be Mozart or Jesus\\". Hathaway enjoys playing music and is first seen playing an acoustic guitar with a group in the Series 1 episode \\"Old School Ties.\\" At the beginning of the episode \\"Your Sudden Death Question,\\" he gets ready to head to a festival of world music, toting his guitar, a Gibson L-5, which he refers to as \\"she.\\" Later on in the episode, it's revealed that the guitar is worth over three thousand pounds. As a police officer Hathaway has been described as \\"chain- smoking, moody and emotionally buttoned-up\\", a \\"dryhumoured intellectual\\". Hathaway's \\"deep thinking and erudite approach\\" complements Lewis's instincts and experience. Russell Lewis, who has written for Inspector Morse, Lewis and Endeavour, indicated that the letters THAW in the Sergeant's surname were a tribute to late actor John Thaw who played Inspector Morse. In the pilot episode, Hathaway is at first, sergeant to DI Charles Knox. Knox is shown taking a breathalyzer test and is subsequently placed on suspension. Lewis is assigned to take his place.Pilot episode Romantic life In \\"The Point of Vanishing\\", it is disclosed that Hathaway and DS (now Inspector) Fiona McKendrick were romantically involved for some period of time. In \\"Life Born of Fire\\", there are hints that Hathaway may have had a close relationship with or a romantic interest in one of the male characters (Jonjo Read) but this is never made explicit. He also shows interest in a trans woman character (Zoë Kenneth). He refuses to directly answer Lewis's question as to whether or not he is gay, berating Lewis for drawing a \\"neat dividing line\\" between heterosexuals who \\"read Loaded and eat Yorkie bars\\" and homosexuals who like shoes and musicals. In the final scene of the episode, Lewis joins Hathaway, who starts reading a copy of Loaded and hands Lewis a Yorkie bar. But even then, its unclear if Hathaway is being ironic. In \\"The Dead of Winter\\", Hathaway appears to become romantically involved with a woman from his early teenage years (by going out on a date and then leaving her flat the next morning) who may or may not be suspect in a murder investigation. Lewis suspends him from the investigation fearing Hathaway crossed an ethical line. At the end of the episode Hathaway says he's going to resign. Lewis turns him down and tells him, \\"Between us, we make a not-bad detective. I'm the brains, obviously.\\" \\"The Soul of Genius\\", the first episode of series 6, highlights Hathaway's awkwardness with women, with him being so nervous while talking to one that he ends up bowing to her, to which she replies with an exaggerated curtsy. It's deliberately left open with multiple opportunities as to fan theories for viewers to decide for themselves whether Hathaway may actually be gay, straight or bi, although it's never formally defined. Apart from certain episodes featuring obvious references to Hathaway's possible sexuality, Lewis doesn't seem to mind what Hathaway's sexuality may be. Function in the series \\"Hathaway, the image of the mature, educated, even sophisticated postmodern believer, holds his faith a closely guarded secret. However, when he gives evidence in court in \\"The Dead of Winter\\", he makes an affirmation that his evidence is true, rather than taking a religious oath, thus suggesting some uncertainty in his faith. The series requires that he share theological trivia, translate Latin and Greek ... The most viewers know about him is that he left the seminary guilty over the orthodox but ultimately deadly advice he gave a gay friend about coping with his homosexuality.\\" References  External links  Mystery!

In October 1936, Boston promoter Paul Bowser brought Casey to the United States. On 11 February 1938, he received the biggest victory of his career when he defeated the legendary Lou Thesz to win the American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship. On 26 August, he wrestled Danno O'Mahony to a draw after ten five-minute rounds in the European style. In September 1938, Casey was stripped of the NWA title, officially for being out of the country. He continued to be recognized as champion by the Boston-based American Wrestling Association. On 18 September, he beat O'Mahony in Munster in a finish match in 18 rounds and 97 minutes. On 2 March 1939, Casey lost the AWA World Championship to Marvin Westenberg in Boston. On 29 March, he beat Gus Sonnenberg to start his second reign as AWA champion, losing the title to Ed Don George on 18 April in Albany, New York. He defeated George to win his start his third reign as AWA World Champion on 29 November 1939, dropping the title to The French Angel on 13 May 1940. In the same year, he beat Richard Codman for the Governor's Cup in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He defeated the U.S. boxing champion Tiger Warrenton and issued a challenge to Joe Louis which went unanswered. On 12 November 1941, he challenged Earl McCready for the British Empire Heavyweight Championship but the match was fought to no contest. On 13 May 1942, Casey beat French Angel for his fourth reign as AWA champion. While still champion, Casey joined the United States Army during World War II, serving from 1942 to 1944. On 6 June 1945 in Boston, he defeated Frank Sexton to start his sixth reign as AWA champion and re-lost the title to Sexton three weeks later. In 1947, he announced his retirement at age 38. He opened a liquor store near Nantasket Beach in Hull, Massachusetts. He also owned a bar on Massachusetts Ave., Boston in the 1950s.  Personal life  In 1983, the Casey family organized a family reunion in Sneem, Ireland. On 10 January 1987, he died at age 78.  Championships and accomplishments  In 1982, Casey was awarded the Irish Hall of Fame award by 1956 Olympic Gold Medalist Ronnie Delaney.

It was Alesis's first major foray into synthesizer production. Function In the Quadrasynth's composite synthesis system, up to four \\"tones\\" are used to create a single \\"patch\\" or synthesizer sound. These individual \\"tones\\" are created by using 16-bit digital single-cycle waveforms or digital samples as oscillator sources, and are then processed via a digital non-resonant filter, various LFOs and envelope generators, and so on - in the usual manner. The Quadrasynth contained 16MB of ROM containing PCM-based waveforms and samples, with the option of expanding the sample base via PCMCIA expansion cards which plug into the back of the synthesizer. A \\"patch\\" on the Quadrasynth can contain 1, 2, 3 or 4 of these tones. However, polyphony decreases as more tones are used. For example, a 1-tone patch would have 64-note polyphony, a 2-tone patch would have 32-note polyphony, and a 4-tone patch would only have 16-note polyphony. Patches can only be stored in the User bank. All other banks are factory presets which cannot be overwritten. The Quadrasynth was typical of synthesizers of the early 90s, featuring a digital, menu-based editing system. Editing user patches could be tedious if the user is unfamiliar with its complex editing structure or has not read the manual. A multitimbral \\"mix\\" (or \\"performance\\") can contain up to 16 parts (patches). Each part can respond to the full range of the keyboard or to a configured subrange, which allows for layering and splitting. Each patch in a mix corresponds to a different MIDI channel, so that the Quadrasynth can become a multitimbral playback device for external sequencers or MIDI file players. The Quadrasynth also had a 4-bus multi effects processor, which is based on Alesis' own Quadraverb 2 stand-alone effects processor. A main function of the synthesizer is its ability to output in Quadraphonic, on the rear of the keyboard . History In 1995, Alesis gave the Quadrasynth an upgrade with the QuadraSynth Plus. It had more ROM (24MB), plus many more program patches. The General MIDI library was added, as well as an 8MB stereo Grand Piano sample. In 1996, Alesis introduced the first of their QS series synthesizers. The first of these were the QS6 61-note synth and the QSR rackmount synth. Following these in quick succession were the QS7 76-note synth and the QS8 88-note synth (the flagship of the series). Essentially, the QS synths' architecture is still based on the original Quadrasynth, but with the important addition of a modulation matrix, allowing users to assign virtually any controller source to any modulation parameter. Many of the sounds in the Preset and User banks were re-written, and new samples were created, including samples of Keith Emerson's infamous Yamaha GX1 synthesizer. Emerson even wrote new patches for it, and demonstrated the new QS8 at a release party for Alesis in 1996. In 1998, Alesis upgraded the QS line with the QS6.1, QS7.1 and QS8.1, which were basically the same as the original QS line, except that Alesis created a new 8MB Bosendorfer Stereo Grand Piano sample for them. Also, a bigger LCD screen, and a few extra assignable sliders (for performance tweaking) were included. In 2003, Alesis decided to keep the QS series alive with the QS6.2 and QS8.2 (there was no 76-key version). This happened after Alesis declared bankruptcy in 2001 and was acquired by Numark. Basically, the x.2 line is identical to the x.1 line but with many stripped-down hardware options. There is now no ADAT port, no multiple outs (only a stereo pair), only one PCMCIA expansion slot, and no aftertouch on the 88-key model. The only other differences are a new brushed-aluminum casing (replacing the original black metal casing), plastic end-caps instead of oak (on the 88-key models), ergonomic placing of cursor buttons, and 24-bit effects and DAC's.

In 1922, the Blundell sisters wished to give the school to the church, and they approached Archdeacon Langley, who was responsible for its temporary move from 77 Allison Road, Elsternwick, to St Mary's Jubilee School Hall. The Argus reported on the re-opening and Archdeacon Langley's appointment of Ada Mary Thomas (1885-1949) as the school's head mistress: ::There was a large gathering of residents of Caulfield and Elsternwick, including several of the neighbouring clergy, to witness the formal reopening of Shelford Girls' School, a long-established Elsternwick school, as a girls' school and kindergarten in connection with St. Mary's Church, Caulfield. Bishop Green, in declaring the school open, congratulated the vicar (Canon Langley) on an initial enrolment of 60 pupils. The mayor of Caulfield (Councillor [Thomas] Falls) and the Rev. [James Valentine] Patton, of Sydney, also spoke. Canon Langley said that the school is to be called by the old name of Shelford, but will be carried on as a Church of England school, under a local council, with A. M. Thomas as principal. It is proposed to build up-to-date school buildings at a site for a branch church near the Caulfield Town Hall [viz., St Margarets], but for the present the school will meet in the existing school buildings at St. Mary's, Caulfield. — The Argus, 23 February 1922.The Schools, The Argus, (Thursday, 23 February 1922), p.9. The following year, Archdeacon Langley moved the school to \\"Helenslea\\" in Hood Crescent, Caulfield North.An article, written at the time of Langley's retirement as Dean of St. Paul's, notes that \\"another venture [of Langley's] which was successful was the purchase of the Shelford Girls' school property with only £5 to make a payment as deposit\\" (In the Churches: An Aggressive Venturesome Spirit Urged for Church, The Argus, (Saturday, 22 March 1947), p.17).

The educational philosophy is aspire, engage and achieve. Shelford's Mission Statement is > Shelford strives to provide a quality education that encompasses the moral, > physical, intellectual, social, emotional and aesthetic development of all > students within a safe, caring and supportive community that acknowledges > its rich heritage and Christian traditions, Shelford has a coeducational Early Learning Centre, which caters for Toddlers from 18 months, as well as providing groups for 3- and 4-year-old children. Consistent with the principles of the Reggio Emilia philosophy, which Shelford has adopted, parents are formally and informally encouraged to actively support the Early Learning Centre's Staff in their teaching and learning programs. The Shelford curriculum is offered through learning programs that focus on the nature and experience of every student; where small class sizes and an open, friendly, and caring culture ensures that each child is well known to each of her teachers, and where a team approach between home and School is highly valued and is considered to be an essential part of the educational process. Academic performance Shelford offers students the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) program, as well as the Vocational Education and Training (VET) course. * In 2014, there were 7 perfect study scores of 50, and Shelford was ranked 3rd in the state of Victoria based on its VCE results, with 37.5% of study scores over 40. * In 2015, there were 4 perfect study scores of 50, and Shelford was ranked 3rd in girls' school in Victoria based on its VCE results. * In 2016, there were 7 perfect study scores of 50, and Shelford was ranked 1st in independent girls' school in Victoria based on its VCE results. * In 2017, there were 4 perfect study scores of 50, and 12% achieved an ATAR over 99. For the 17th year in a row, 100% of Shelford students have received a first round offer for a tertiary institution.

The search for a successful technique began about 1975 and has continued to the present without a clinically or commercially viable product.The Pursuit of Noninvasive Glucose, 7th Edition, by John L. Smith, Ph.D. , only one such product had been approved for sale by the FDA, based on a technique for electrically pulling glucose through intact skin, and it was withdrawn after a short time owing to poor performance and occasional damage to the skin of users. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies who have sought the solution to this long-standing problem. Approaches that have been tried include near infrared spectroscopy (measuring glucose through the skin using light of slightly longer wavelengths than the visible region), transdermal measurement (attempting to pull glucose through the skin using either chemicals, electricity or ultrasound), measuring the amount that polarized light is rotated by glucose in the front chamber of the eye (containing the aqueous humor), and many others. A 2012 study reviewed ten technologies: bioimpedance spectroscopy, microwave/RF sensing, fluorescence technology, mid-infrared spectroscopy, near infrared spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, optical polarimetry, raman spectroscopy, reverse iontophoresis, and ultrasound technology, concluding with the observation that none of these had produced a commercially available, clinically reliable device and that therefore, much work remained to be done. , disregarding the severe shortcomings mentioned above, at least one noninvasive glucose meter was being marketed in a number of countries. Still, as the mean absolute deviation of this device was nearly 30% in clinical trials, 'further research efforts were desired to significantly improve the accuracy [...]'. While multiple technologies have been tried, Raman Spectroscopy has gained traction as one promising technology for measuring glucose in interstitial fluid. Early attempts include C8 Medisensors and the Laser Biomedical Research Center at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) which have been working on a Raman spectroscopy sensor for more than 20 years and conducting clinical investigations in collaboration with the Clinical Research Center at University of Missouri – Columbia. In 2018 a paper in PLOS ONE showed independent validation data from a clinical investigation comprising 15 subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 with a MARD of 25.8%. The system used, was a custom-built confocal Raman setup. In 2019 researchers at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics, in collaboration with the Laser Biomedical Research Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a new approach based on Raman spectroscopy that allowed them to see the glucose signal directly. The researchers tested the system in pigs and could get accurate glucose readings for up to an hour after initial calibration. Recently the German Institute for Diabetes-Technology have published data from 15 subjects with type 1 diabetes on a new prototype GlucoBeam based on Raman spectroscopy from RSP Systems Denmark. Showing a MARD of 23.6% on independent validation in out-patient setup with up till 8 days without recalibration. With accuracy on marketed BGM devices in the US between 5.6 and 20.8%. A NIGM solution would likely need to have an accuracy with a MARD below 20% to be widely accepted. The number of clinical trials of non- invasive glucose monitors has grown throughout the 21st century. While the National Institutes of Health recorded only 4 clinical investigations of the technology from 2000 to 2015, there were 16 from 2016 to 2020.

Due to unrest within the royal family over his rule, Saud was forced to appoint his half-brother, Crown Prince Faisal, as prime minister. An ongoing power struggle between the two led to Faisal's resignation in 1960, allowing Saud to reclaim the reins of government, but continued discontent saw Faisal return as prime minister in 1962.

The highway runs from US 50 on the northwest side of Salisbury to US 13 and US 50 on the east side of Salisbury in central Wicomico County. US 50 Business is a four- to six-lane divided highway within and on either side of the central business district of Salisbury, where the highway intersects MD 349, US 13 Business, and MD 346. US 50 Business west of MD 349 is a mid-1950s upgrade of the original highway entering Salisbury from the northwest. The business route between MD 349 and MD 346 was a relocation of US 50 from Main Street built in the early 1960s. East of MD 346, US 50 Business is part of the relocation of US 50 between Salisbury and Berlin completed in the mid-1960s. US 50 Business was designated when the US 50 portion of the Salisbury Bypass was completed in 2002. Route description US 50 Bus. at Tilghman Drive in Salisbury. View east along US 50 Bus. at Civic Avenue in Salisbury US 50 Business begins at a partial interchange with US 50, with ramps from US 50 east to US 50 Business east and US 50 Business west to US 50 west. One lane of westbound US 50 Business continues beyond the ramp to an intersection with Stanton Avenue, a service road for residences detached from US 50 when the interchange was built. The movements missing from the interchange are completed via Naylor Mill Road just to the east of the partial interchange. US 50 Business heads southeast toward downtown Salisbury as a four-lane divided highway. After passing American Legion Road, the business route enters the city limits of Salisbury and its name changes to Salisbury Parkway. At the intersection with MD 349 (Nanticoke Road) and Isabella Street, US 50 Business turns east, expands to six lanes, becomes a partially controlled access highway, and begins to parallel Main Street, the original alignment of US 50. After crossing the North Prong of the Wicomico River on a drawbridge, the business route intersects Division Street, the original alignment of US 13. The highway drops to four lanes as ramps to Baptist Street heading eastbound and from Broad Street heading westbound leave the highway; these streets are used to access US 13 Business (Salisbury Boulevard). US 50 Business expands to six lanes again after passing under US 13 Business and the Delmarva Subdivision track of the Delmarva Central Railroad. The business route returns to four lanes after the intersection with MD 346 (Main Street), which is the original alignment of US 50. The median expands as US 50 Business passes commercial and industrial properties. A park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of the Phillip Morris Drive intersection. Shortly after the intersection with Tilghman Road, the business route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Salisbury Bypass, which features US 13 and US 50 west. The divided highway continues east as US 50 (Ocean Gateway) toward Ocean City. US 50 Business is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History The original east-west highway through Salisbury entered the city from Hebron along its present course from the northwest to Isabella Street. The highway then followed Main Street to downtown Salisbury. The highway followed Broad Street to Church Street, which the road followed east toward Parsonsburg. This highway was one of the original state roads designated for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) in 1909. The state roads from Hebron to the western limit of Salisbury and from the eastern limit of Salisbury to Parsonsburg were both completed in 1914. The SRC directed two major changes on Main Street in the mid-1920s. First, the SRC took over maintenance of the drawbridge over the North Prong of the Wicomico River in 1924 and completed its replacement in 1928. While Main Street is no longer a state highway, MDSHA continues to maintain the Main Street drawbridge. The drawbridge was reconstructed in 1980 and is designated as MD 991, which is unsigned. Secondly, the SRC extended Main Street east from downtown along its present course east and then northeast to Church Street in 1926. US 213 was designated as the main east-west highway through Salisbury in 1927. US 213 was moved from Church Street to Main Street around 1940. US 50 replaced US 213 through Salisbury in 1949. US 50 through Salisbury was upgraded in three portions in the 1950s and 1960s. US 50 west of Isabella Street was expanded to a four-lane divided highway northwest to Naylor Mill Road in 1954. Planning for what became Salisbury Parkway between Isabella Street and Main Street east of downtown began after World War II, when right-of-way estimates were made on routes along Isabella Street and Church Street.

Situated within the river valleys of the Francolí and Anguera, it has historically been known for its white wines, but has been gaining more attention for its reds, especially those from the native Trepat grape. Today, the Conca de Barberà DOP mainly produces red wines, along with whites, and minor amounts of rosés and sparkling wines. History It is highly probable that wine production was introduced by the ancient Romans but by the time of the Moorish dominion of the Iberian peninsula it had all but disappeared from the Conca de Barberà area. As in many other wine producing regions, wine production took off again thanks to the influence of the monasteries founded in the Middle Ages, in this case the Monastery of Santa Maria de Poblet, near Montblanc which was then the third largest city of Catalonia. In the 12th century both the Knights Templar and the monks from Poblet worked the vineyards. The wine was produced in the basement of the monastery and can be visited today. The period from the end of the 18th century to the mid 19th century was one of expansion for the area. Wines and spirits were exported to northern Europe and to the Americas and grapes became the dominant crop. In this period terraces were built on the mountainsides to increase the area under vines as much as possible. The railway connecting Montblanc to Reus on the coast was built in order to transport wine more rapidly and efficiently. The arrival of the phylloxera virus at the end of the 19th century marked the end of this boom period as most of the vineyards were devastated. However the comeback was spectacular. The Conca de Barberà area was the first in Catalonia, and in the rest of Spain, to form agricultural cooperatives based on grape growing and wine production. Thus in 1894 the grape growers of Barberà founded a syndicate for collective wine production. Under the direction of Joan Espulgas (a vintner who had learned how to combat the phylloxera virus in France) the syndicate undertook the project of replanting all the vineyards in the Conca area, by grafting onto phylloxera resistant New World rootstock. Success ensued and in 1903 the first cooperative winery in Spain was built in the town of Barberà. Conca de Barberà attained official DO status in 1985. Geography Vineyards near Poblet Monastery Most of the vineyards are located around the historic town of Montblanc, and the DOP covers a total of 14 municipalities in the north of the province of Tarragona: Barberà de la Conca, Blancafort, Conesa, L'Espluga de Francolí, Forès, Montblanc, Pira, Rocafort de Queralt, Sarral, Senan, Solivella, Vallclara, Vilaverd and Vimbodí i Poblet. The vineyards are planted in the valleys of the rivers Francolí and Anguera and are surrounded and protected by mountain ranges: the Serra de Montclar, Codony mountain and Serra de Comalats in the north, the Serra de Miramar and Cogulló in the east, the Serra de Prades in the south, and the Serra del Tallat and Serra de Vilobí in the west. The land is mainly flat or slightly undulating at heights of between 350 and 600 m above sea level. Soils Most of the vines are on dark lime bearing soils, quite loose and poor in organic matter. Towards the foothills of the Sierra de Prades slate can be found in the rock. Climate The climate is temperate Mediterranean, with hot summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature is 14 °C with extremes of 35 °C in summer and -6 °C in winter. There is a risk of frost in spring for the vineyards at the highest altitudes. Rainfall is mainly in autumn and the average annual figure is around 500 mm. The mountain ranges protect the area from the wind, while the high altitude means that the summers are not too hot. Humidity is slightly higher than in neighboring DOP's. The vines receive around 2,500 hours of sunlight per year. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Trepat, Ull de llebre, Garnatxa Negra, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Monastrell, Sumoll, and Syrah * Rosé: Trepat * White: Xenin, Sumoll Blanc, Parellada, Macabeu, Garnatxa Blanca, Moscatell de Gra Petit, and Chardonnay The older vines are planted as low bushes (en got), while the more recently planted ones are on trellises (en espatllera) to increase production. Planting density is around 2–2,500 vines per hectare, though the maximum authorized density is 4,500 vines/ha. See also * Catalan wine * Trepat References External links * D.O.P.

It was one of many witch trials in the early modern period, but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it \\"attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century\\". Overview The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at Warboys in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 9-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the Squire of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane's four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her. Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of Sir Henry Cromwell, one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty. Initial allegations Throckmorton family The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589. Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell's witchcraft. Jane's fits were described as such: \\"Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie\\". Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child's side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: \\"Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her\\". Jane's mother thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick. However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her. It did not. After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane's urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton's daughters fell sick to the same illness that was afflicting Jane. These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: \\"Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away\\". The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the \\"Michaelmas before\\" (September 29, 1588). Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to \\"(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed\\". When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair. The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day. They believed that God freed them of this sorcery and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying. Lady Cromwell In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice. During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of scissors and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a folk remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592. Trial Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day. However, she confessed again when she was brought before the Bishop of Lincoln, and taken to Huntingdon where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband. The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice's words to Lady Cromwell (\\"Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet\\") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged. Posthumous proof The jailer and his wife examined the corpses. Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a witches' mark (also known as a \\"devil's mark\\") was important legal proof at this period in England. \\"[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda\\". This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide, the \\"sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat\\", and particularly in feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials. It is also cited by writers such as Lynn Picknett. Aftermath The scholar George Kittredge (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial \\"the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England\\", partially because it had \\"demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws\\". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the Witchcraft Act of 1604. Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure. JSTOR. Web. 5 November 2014.  In culture  In Kate Pullinger's 1999 novel, Weird Sister, Agnes Samuel returns to the present day to terrorise the Throckmorton family, who still reside in Warboys but have no memory of the events of the late 16th century.

In a centralized management, the ranking is so that those with the lowest marginal costs are the first ones to be brought online to meet demand, and the plants with the highest marginal costs are the last to be brought on line. Dispatching generation in this way, known as \\"economic dispatch\\", minimizes the cost of production of electricity. Sometimes generating units must be started out of merit order, due to transmission congestion, system reliability or other reasons. In environmental dispatch, additional considerations concerning reduction of pollution further complicate the power dispatch problem. The basic constraints of the economic dispatch problem remain in place but the model is optimized to minimize pollutant emission in addition to minimizing fuel costs and total power loss. SMARD data portal showing electricity generation in Germany in mid-December 2017. The ordering of the 'layers' is based on merit.  The effect of renewable energy on merit order  The high demand for electricity during peak demand pushes up the bidding price for electricity, and the often relatively inexpensive baseload power supply mix is supplemented by 'peaking power plants', which charge a premium for their electricity. Increasing the supply of renewable energy tends to lower the average price per unit of electricity because wind energy and solar energy have very low marginal costs: they do not have to pay for fuel, and the sole contributors to their marginal cost is operations and maintenance. With cost often reduced by feed-in-tariff revenue, their electricity is as a result, less costly on the spot market than that from coal or natural gas, and transmission companies buy from them first. Solar and wind electricity therefore substantially reduce the amount of highly priced peak electricity that transmission companies need to buy, reducing the overall cost. A study by the Fraunhofer Institute ISI found that this \\"merit order effect\\" had allowed solar power to reduce the price of electricity on the German energy exchange by 10% on average, and by as much as 40% in the early afternoon. In 2007; as more solar electricity is fed into the grid, peak prices may come down even further. By 2006, the \\"merit order effect\\" meant that the savings in electricity costs to German consumers more than offset for the support payments paid for renewable electricity generation. A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation in Germany between the years 2008 and 2012. For each additional GWh of renewables fed into the grid, the price of electricity in the day-ahead market is reduced by 0.11–0.13¢/kWh. The total merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1¢/kWh in 2012. The zero marginal cost of wind and solar energy does not, however, translate into zero marginal cost of peak load electricity in a competitive open electricity market system as wind and solar supply alone often cannot be dispatched to meet peak demand without batteries. The purpose of the merit order was to enable the lowest net cost electricity to be dispatched first thus minimising overall electricity system costs to consumers. Intermittent wind and solar is sometimes able to supply this economic function. If peak wind (or solar) supply and peak demand both coincide in time and quantity, the price reduction is larger. On the other hand, solar energy tends to be most abundant at noon, whereas peak demand is late afternoon in warm climates, leading to the so-called duck curve. A 2008 study by the Fraunhofer Institute ISI in Karlsruhe, Germany found that windpower saves German consumers €5billion a year. It is estimated to have lowered prices in European countries with high wind generation by between 3 and 23€/MWh. On the other hand, renewable energy in Germany increased the price for electricity, consumers there now pay 52.8 €/MWh more only for renewable energy (see German Renewable Energy Sources Act), average price for electricity in Germany now is increased to 26¢/kWh. Increasing electrical grid costs for new transmission, market trading and storage associated with wind and solar are not included in the marginal cost of power sources, instead grid costs are combined with source costs at the consumer end. Economic dispatch Economic dispatch is the short-term determination of the optimal output of a number of electricity generation facilities, to meet the system load, at the lowest possible cost, subject to transmission and operational constraints. The Economic Dispatch Problem is solved by specialized computer software which should satisfy the operational and system constraints of the available resources and corresponding transmission capabilities. In the US Energy Policy Act of 2005, the term is defined as \\"the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost to reliably serve consumers, recognising any operational limits of generation and transmission facilities\\".Energy Policy Act 2005. The main idea is that, in order to satisfy the load at a minimum total cost, the set of generators with the lowest marginal costs must be used first, with the marginal cost of the final generator needed to meet load setting the system marginal cost. This is the cost of delivering one additional MWh of energy onto the system. Due to transmission constraints, this cost can vary at different locations within the power grid - these different cost levels are identified as \\"locational marginal prices\\" (LMPs). The historic methodology for economic dispatch was developed to manage fossil fuel burning power plants, relying on calculations involving the input/output characteristics of power stations. Basic mathematical formulation The following is based on Biggar and Hesamzadeh (2014) and Kirschen (2010). The economic dispatch problem can be thought of as maximising the economic welfare of a power network whilst meeting system constraints. For a network with buses (nodes), suppose that is the rate of generation, and is the rate of consumption at bus . Suppose, further, that is the cost function of producing power (i.e., the rate at which the generator incurs costs when producing at rate ), and is the rate at which the load receives value or benefits (expressed in currency units) when consuming at rate . The total welfare is then :W= \\\\sum_{k=1}^n V_k(D_k)- \\\\sum_{k=1}^n C_k(S_k) The economic dispatch task is to find the combination of rates of production and consumption () which maximise this expression subject to a number of constraints: : \\\\max_{S_k,D_k} W The first constraint, which is necessary to interpret the constraints that follow, is that the net injection at each bus is equal to the total production at that bus less the total consumption: :\\\\forall k, \\\\; I_k=S_k-D_k The power balance constraint requires that the sum of the net injections at all buses must be equal to the power losses in the branches of the network: : \\\\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = L(I_1,I_2,\\\\dots,I_{n-1}) The power losses depend on the flows in the branches and thus on the net injections as shown in the above equation. However it cannot depend on the injections on all the buses as this would give an over- determined system. Thus one bus is chosen as the Slack bus and is omitted from the variables of the function . The choice of Slack bus is entirely arbitrary, here bus is chosen. The second constraint involves capacity constraints on the flow on network lines. For a system with lines this constraint is modeled as: : F_l(I_1,I_2,\\\\dots,I_{n-1}) \\\\leq F_{l}^{max} \\\\qquad l=1,\\\\dots,m where is the flow on branch , and is the maximum value that this flow is allowed to take. Note that the net injection at the slack bus is not included in this equation for the same reasons as above. These equations can now be combined to build the Lagrangian of the optimization problem: : \\\\mathcal{L}= \\\\sum_{k=1}^n C_k(I_k) + \\\\pi \\\\left [ L(I_1,I_2,\\\\dots,I_{n-1})-\\\\sum_{k=1}^n I_k \\\\right ] + \\\\sum_{l=1}^m \\\\mu_l \\\\left [ F_{l}^{max}-F_l(I_1,I_2,\\\\dots,I_{n-1}) \\\\right ] where π and μ are the Lagrangian multipliers of the constraints. The conditions for optimality are then: : {\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\over\\\\partial I_k} = 0 \\\\qquad k=1,\\\\dots,n : {\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\over\\\\partial \\\\pi} = 0 : {\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\over\\\\partial \\\\mu_l} = 0 \\\\qquad l=1,\\\\dots,m : \\\\mu_l \\\\cdot \\\\left [ F_{l}^{max}-F_l(I_1,I_2,\\\\dots,I_{n-1}) \\\\right ] = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mu_l \\\\geq 0 \\\\quad k=1,\\\\dots,n where the last condition is needed to handle the inequality constraint on line capacity. Solving these equations is computationally difficult as they are nonlinear and implicitly involve the solution of the power flow equations. The analysis can be simplified using a linearised model called a DC power flow. There is a special case which is found in much of the literature. This is the case in which demand is assumed to be perfectly inelastic (i.e., unresponsive to price). This is equivalent to assuming that V_k(D_k)= M \\\\min(D_k,\\\\bar{D}_k) for some very large value of M and inelastic demand \\\\bar{D}_k. Under this assumption, the total economic welfare is maximised by choosing D_k=\\\\bar{D}_k. The economic dispatch task reduces to: :\\\\min_{S_k} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n C_k(S_k) Subject to the constraint that \\\\forall k, \\\\; I_k=S_k-\\\\bar{D}_k and the other constraints set out above. Environmental dispatch In environmental dispatch, additional considerations concerning reduction of pollution further complicate the power dispatch problem. The basic constraints of the economic dispatch problem remain in place but the model is optimized to minimize pollutant emission in addition to minimizing fuel costs and total power loss. Due to the added complexity, a number of algorithms have been employed to optimize this environmental/economic dispatch problem. Notably, a modified bees algorithm implementing chaotic modeling principles was successfully applied not only in silico, but also on a physical model system of generators.. Other methods used to address the economic emission dispatch problem include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and neural networks Another notable algorithm combination is used in a real-time emissions tool called Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology (LEEM) that links electric power consumption and the resulting pollutant emissions. The LEEM estimates changes in emissions associated with incremental changes in power demand derived from the locational marginal price (LMP) information from the independent system operators (ISOs) and emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). LEEM was developed at Wayne State University as part of a project aimed at optimizing water transmission systems in Detroit, MI starting in 2010 and has since found a wider application as a load profile management tool that can help reduce generation costs and emissions.

The BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb is the submunition used in several cluster bomb type weapon systems, mainly the CBU-87 and its precision- guided version CBU-103. When the bomblets fall, they separate from the main bomb and independently free fall to the ground. They contain an inflatable bag (ballute) on the top of them, which slows them down and spreads them out. Once the bomblets reach a force of 6 Gs they arm themselves. As the bomblets fall, they are also spinning. Arming takes about 2.6 seconds. They have a combined shaped charge, fragmentation and incendiary effect on the target. It is very effective against and mainly used for anti-personnel, anti-materiel, and anti- armor. Over two million of these sub-munitions were dropped over Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf War. A 5% dud rate was expected, so around 100,000 unexploded bomblets remained after the war. Each was fitted with an extremely sensitive fuze and the US Army recommended that they not be moved. Clearing this unexploded ordnance resulted in several accidents. On one occasion, seven US combat engineers from Company A of the 27th Engineer Battalion died attempting to clear the runway at the As Salam airbase in Iraq. In 2003 humanitarian groups expressed concern that the BLU-97/B bomblets were the same size and color as food rations given to children in Afghanistan. Although the latter are square and the former cylindrical, both are dropped from U.S. planes and both are yellow so that they are easy to spot on the ground. The United States responded to the criticism by changing the color of future food packages and warning civilians through announcements and flyers. Pentagon officials also said that the packages had not been dropped in the same areas as cluster bombs.

The school serves Innisfail and South Johnstone / Mourilyan and Innisfail's outlying regional areas, generally extending north to Babinda, south to Tully and Mission Beach and inland to Millaa Millaa. History Good Counsel College was established in 1975 as a result of the joining of two separate single sex education institutes: The Sacred Heart Girls School conducted by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and the Marist Brothers' Boys' School. Initially the school was organized catering only to students in years 8, 9 and 10. However under guidance from the school's first lay principal Peter Albion the school was quickly established as an academic institute offering a full secondary education. In recent years the school has undergone significant expansion both in terms of enrolments and infrastructure, having trebled the number of enrolments since its inception in 1975. House system As is common in Australian secondary schools, students at Good Counsel during interhouse sporting carnivals are split up into four houses, they are Polding (blue) Marcellin (red), MacKillop (purple) and Clancy (Green), but are also commonly used to group students at assemblies and especially during mass transport to event destinations. Each house has an elected male and female captain, who are responsible for aspects of school carnival preparation. School song The College's song is One Spirit in Christ. The lyrics are: Loving God, You gather us in Your name right here. Together we are family. We share Hope and Faith, playfulness and prayer Loving God, may we enrich each other's lives and grow Together to reveal our love and show The loving God that we have come to know.

Tommy Riggs and Betty Lou was a radio situation comedy broadcast in various time slots from 1938 to 1946. Career Tommy Riggs (born October 21, 1908 in Pittsburgh) switched back and forth from his natural baritone to the voice of a seven-year-old girl, Betty Lou. These dialogues found a shape in later episodes when the character of Betty Lou Barrie was established as Riggs' niece. In 1931, Riggs ran a poultry business, as well as serving as a pianist-vocalist on radio station WCAE in Pittsburgh. When station manager J.L. Coffin heard Riggs' little girl voice, he put The Tom and Betty Program on WCAE's schedule, and Riggs later moved on to KDKA (Pittsburgh), WTAM (Cleveland) and, in 1937, WLW (Cincinnati), where Harry Frankel (aka Singin' Sam) called a New York agent. An audition in New York led to a transcribed series for Chevrolet, and after Rudy Vallée heard the Chevrolet show, Riggs' agent told him he had two days to get ready for an appearance on Vallée's Royal Gelatin Hour. Vallée signed him for a 13-week contract. The audience reaction was strong: Riggs wound up spending a record 49 weeks on the Vallee show, catapulting him to fame and his own program. The cast included Bert Wheeler, Hank Ladd, and Dick Wheeler. Ben Gage was the announcer, and Victor Young was musical director. Anita Ellis was the program's vocalist. Sam Moore and Robert Brewster were writer and producer, respectively. It was one of the earliest shows scripted by comedy writer, comedian and bestselling author Jack Douglas. Despite the contributions of Douglas, Riggs never attained a level equal to that of Fanny Brice, famed for her Baby Snooks character. In the 1940s, Riggs faded as the popularity of Edgar Bergen (whose Charlie McCarthy character was inevitably compared to Betty Lou) expanded. Tommy Riggs and Betty Lou ran from 1938 to 1940 on NBC, then returned for the summer of 1942 on CBS, after which was picked up for a single season on NBC in 1942–43. Riggs then joined the Navy, taking Betty Lou to Allied camps in the Far East for 18 months; when he returned, radio audiences had largely forgotten him. Riggs had a final run on CBS in the summer of 1946, after which returned to Pittsburgh, where he died in 1967. Legacy Tommy Riggs was later awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and is one of only two honorees who share his star with a fictional character (the other, Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger). In order to find out how he was able to do Betty Lou's voice in the first place, Riggs consulted with doctors at Cornell Medical College. He was told that his throat muscles were unusually large and strong—the strongest they had seen, causing the unusual condition.

Kennedy is a book by attorney Vincent Bugliosi that analyzes the events surrounding the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, focusing on the lives of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. He drew from many sources, including the Warren Report. Bugliosi argues that the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy is correct. The book won the 2008 Edgar Award for the Best Fact Crime category. Bugliosi explored the issues at length; the book is 1,632 pages. It was published with an accompanying CD-ROM containing an additional 1,000+ pages of footnotes. He analyzed both the assassination itself and the rise of the conspiracy theories about the event in the following years. In 2008, Bugliosi published a shorter, paperback edition of this book, entitled Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It concentrated on the events of the assassination and aftermath. This version was adapted for the movie Parkland (2013). A second edition of his paperback was issued as Parkland (2013), to tie into the movie's release. Research Bugliosi based much of the book on his preparation for a mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald staged by British television, in which he acted as the prosecutor of Oswald. The mock trial involved an actual US judge and US citizens acting as jurors, and Oswald was defended by prominent trial lawyer Gerry Spence. Bugliosi obtained a verdict of \\"guilty.\\" He wrote in the Introduction to his book: > My professional interest in the Kennedy assassination dates back to March > 1986 when I was approached by a British production company, London Weekend > Television (LWT) to \\"prosecute\\" Lee Harvey Oswald as the alleged assassin of > President Kennedy in a proposed twenty-one hour television trial to be shown > in England and several other countries, including the United States.

Contents The book is divided into several major parts, including a detailed chronology of the events of the assassination, as well as an exploration of the major conspiracy theories, a chapter on the trial of Jack Ruby, and a chapter featuring Bugliosi's interviews with Marina Oswald. Bugliosi also provides a \\"partial list of assassins...whom one or more conspiracy theorists have actually named and identified as having fired a weapon at Kennedy\\". The list includes 82 names. Critical and commercial reception In a review for The New York Times, Bryan Burrough wrote: \\"Bugliosi is refreshing because he doesn’t just pick apart the conspiracy theorists. He ridicules them, and by name, writing that 'most of them are as kooky as a $3 bill.'\\" Alex Kingsbury of U.S. News & World Report described it as \\"the most exhaustive of the countless narratives that have been written about that fateful day in Dallas.\\" According to Steve Donoghue of Open Letters Monthly: \\"Reclaiming History, in addition to being the longest book ever written on the subject of the Kennedy assassination, is also the most enjoyable of them all to read.\\" Tim Shipman of The Telegraph said: \\"Mr Bugliosi... has turned up no new killer fact. His technique instead is to expose the double-think and distortions of the conspiracy theorists.\\" Kirkus Reviews said the point of Reclaiming History is to \\"dismantle [conspiracy] theories one by one, in sometimes tedious and overladen detail\\". Kirkus added that \\"Bugliosi does himself and his argument no favors with his tone of flippancy and dismissiveness,\\" but described the book as \\"oddly fascinating\\". The book has been criticized by conspiracy advocates and theorists. Reviewing the book's introduction for Salon, David Talbot, a conspiracy advocate, criticized Bugliosi's characterization of Robert F. Kennedy's views of the Warren Commission, describing Bugliosi's research as \\"skin-deep\\" and saying that he is \\"guilty of cooking the facts to make his case\\". Later editions and adaptations A shorter edition of the book, titled Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy (Norton, 2008; 688 pages; ), was published in paperback the following year.\\"Four Days in November\\" W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. Retrieved January 14, 2018 This version largely dispensed with much of Bugliosi's debunking of conspiracy theories, and concentrated on his narrative of the known events. In discussing publication of this version in a 2009 interview with Patt Morrison of the Los Angeles Times, Bugliosi described Reclaiming History as his magnum opus. He said it was the work of which he was most proud. Comparing its sales to those for his 1974 bestseller Helter Skelter, he said to Morrison, \\"if you want to make money, you don't put out a book that weighs pounds and costs $57 and has over 10,000 citations and a million and a half words.\\" The 2008 book was adapted for the film Parkland (2013). The title refers to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald and years later, Jack Ruby, were taken for treatment before their deaths. The 2008 edition was reissued and retitled in 2013 as Parkland, to tie in with the release of the film.

In total, he led athletes to eleven medals over five Olympic Games. However, in an era where amateurism was prized, he was not officially recognised because he was a professional coach.Sam Mussabini. Southwark Council Early life and career Mussabini was born in Blackheath, London of Syrian, Turkish, Italian and French ancestry. He was the son of Aline (Farcat) and Neocles Gaspard Mussabini. He was educated in France, and later followed his father into journalism. In the 1890s he was also a professional sprinter for about five years. In 1894 he coached Bert Harris to the first professional cycling championship the same year he was employed as a cycling coach by the bicycle tyre company Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company. Mussabini played billiards to a high standard and reported on matches as a sports journalist during the winter months. In 1897 he co-authored a technical book on billiards and began writing articles for a billiards journal. In 1902, he became its assistant editor and later the joint proprietor and editor. In 1904 he wrote a two-volume book on the technicalities of billiards. He was also one of the top billiard referees. Olympic athlete coaching He coached the South African sprinter Reggie Walker to a gold medal at the 1908 Olympic Games in London. He coached further gold medal winners at the 1912 Olympic Games, including Willie Applegarth. He was appointed as full-time coach by Polytechnic Harriers from 1913 until his death from diabetes in 1927. He brought a systematic approach to coaching, rather than just being a masseur. For example, he used the techniques of Eadweard Muybridge to photograph runners' actions and techniques at the finish. At the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium, he coached Albert Hill to two gold medals in the 800 m and 1500 m, and Harry Edward, third in the 100 m. He led Harold Abrahams to win a gold medal in the 100 m and silver in the 4 × 100 m at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, France. Legacy and honours Mussabini's success at the 1924 Olympics was portrayed in the film Chariots of Fire in which Mussabini is played by Ian Holm. After filming, Ian Holm exchanged letters with living relatives of Mussabini concerned about accuracy. His trainees won further medals at the 1928 Olympic Games after his death. In 1998, the Mussabini Medal was created, to celebrate the contribution of coaches of UK performers who have achieved outstanding success on the world stage.

It was created by scientists Anita Longley and Phil Rice of the then Central Radio Propagation Laboratory in Boulder, CO for the needs of frequency planning in television broadcasting in the United States in the 1960s and was extensively used for preparing the tables of channel allocations for VHF/UHF broadcasting there. LR has two parts: a model for predictions over an area and a model for point-to-point link predictions. Publications A description of the method was published by the U.S. government under the title \\"Prediction of tropospheric radio transmission loss over irregular terrain. A computer method-1968\\", A. G. Longley and P. L. Rice, ESSA Tech. Rep. ERL 79-ITS 67, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, July 1968. This document followed on an earlier publication titled \\"Transmission loss predictions for tropospheric communication circuits\\", P.L. Rice, Volume I & II, National Bureau of Standards, Tech. Note 101. The Longley–Rice model was proposed for frequencies between 20 MHz and 20 GHz for different scenarios and different heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The model presents a generalization of the received signal power without a detailed characterization of the channel. This model uses statistical resources to compensate for the characterization of the channel, which depends on the variables of each scenario and environment. The variation of the signal is determined by the prediction model according to the atmospheric changes, topographic profile and free space. These variations are described with the help of statistical estimates which have deviations that contribute to the total attenuation of the signal. The statistical estimates or attenuation variables of this prediction model are: I) Situation variability (Ys); II) Time variability (Yt); II) Location variability (YL). The reference attenuation (W) is determined as a function of the distance, attenuation variables and an urban factor for an area or point-to-point. Because of this variability, there could be deviations (δ) more or less significant to the attenuation of the transmitted signal. The received signal (W) is obtained signal level attenuated in free space (W0) attenuated by the sum of the attenuation formed by random variables. If transmitter and receiver are at known points, the location variable has a value of zero. The reference attenuation defined as a function of distance also features 3 ranges for prediction: I) line-of-sight; II) diffraction; III) scatter. For each of these ranges, there are attenuation coefficients defined according to link geometry. These variables also consider the topography that is defined as terrain irregularity parameter ∆h(d) for a reference distance (D0). Software Several applications use the Longley-Rice Model.

It is based on the line chart. The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings. Commonly one compares two or more quantities with an area chart.  History  William Playfair is usually credited with inventing the area charts as well as the line, bar, and pie charts. His book The Commercial and Political Atlas, published in 1786, contained a number of time-series graphs, including Interest of the National Debt from the Revolution and Chart of all the Imports and Exports to and from England from the Year 1700 to 1782 that are often described as the first area charts in history.  Common uses  Area charts are used to represent cumulated totals using numbers or percentages (stacked area charts in this case) over time. Use the area chart for showing trends over time among related attributes. The area chart is like the plot chart except that the area below the plotted line is filled in with color to indicate volume. When multiple attributes are included, the first attribute is plotted as a line with color fill followed by the second attribute, and so on.  Variations  Area charts which use vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points in a series forming a step-like progression are called step-area charts. Area charts in which data points are connected by smooth curves instead of straight lines are called spline-area charts. Stacked area charts in which the area is displaced around the central axis are called streamgraphs.

This polyhedron has no diagonals; every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The seven vertices and 21 edges of the Császár polyhedron form an embedding of the complete graph K_7 onto a topological torus. Of the 35 possible triangles from vertices of the polyhedron, only 14 are faces. Complete graph STL model of a Császár polyhedron Interactive orthographic projection of a Csaszar polyhedron. In [ the SVG image], move the mouse left and right to rotate the model. The tetrahedron and the Császár polyhedron are the only two known polyhedra (having a manifold boundary) without any diagonals: every two vertices of the polygon are connected by an edge, so there is no line segment between two vertices that does not lie on the polyhedron boundary. That is, the vertices and edges of the Császár polyhedron form a complete graph. If the boundary of a polyhedron with v vertices forms a surface with h holes, in such a way that every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, it follows by some manipulation of the Euler characteristic that :h = \\\\frac{(v-3)(v-4)}{12}. This equation is satisfied for the tetrahedron with h = 0 and v = 4, and for the Császár polyhedron with h = 1 and v = 7. The next possible solution, h = 6 and v = 12, would correspond to a polyhedron with 44 faces and 66 edges, but it is not realizable as a polyhedron. It is not known whether such a polyhedron exists with a higher genus . More generally, this equation can be satisfied only when v is congruent to 0, 3, 4, or 7 modulo 12 . History and related polyhedra The Császár polyhedron is named after Hungarian topologist Ákos Császár, who discovered it in 1949. The dual to the Császár polyhedron, the Szilassi polyhedron, was discovered later, in 1977, by Lajos Szilassi; it has 14 vertices, 21 edges, and seven hexagonal faces, each sharing an edge with every other face. Like the Császár polyhedron, the Szilassi polyhedron has the topology of a torus. There are other known polyhedra such as the Schönhardt polyhedron for which there are no interior diagonals (that is, all diagonals are outside the polyhedron) as well as non-manifold surfaces with no diagonals .

He served as a coach on four World Series championship Major League Baseball (MLB) teams with the Oakland Athletics and New York Mets. Hoscheit was the Mets' bullpen coach from 1984 to 1987, which included their World Series championship run in 1986. During that season's spring training, he accurately predicted that the team would clinch the National League East Division title on September 17, long before any regular season game was even played. Playing career Born in Brunswick, Nebraska, Hoscheit originally signed with the New York Yankees and was a catcher in their farm system for 12 seasons, starting in 1941. He missed the 1943–45 seasons because of World War II military service, but returned to hit .245 for the Binghamton Triplets in the Class A Eastern League, where his manager was Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Lefty Gomez. Hoscheit also caught 25 games in 1947 for Binghamton while hitting .271. He hung on in the minor leagues until 1955, his best season being 1951, when he hit .354 with 11 home runs and 109 RBIs for the McAlester Rockets of Class D Sooner State League. Hoscheit managed in the lower levels of the Yankees' organization from 1948–59. Post-playing career Hoscheit also was an executive in minor league baseball. He was the general manager for the Quincy (1955–56), Peoria (1957), and Greensboro (1958–59) clubs, concurrent with being their field manager, and then became president of the Three-I League in 1960. After the Three-I League disbanded following the 1961 season, Hoscheit joined the Baltimore Orioles and was a scout and minor league instructor (1962–67) and Major League coach (1968). He switched to Oakland and was a coach from 1969 to 1974, earning World Series rings in his final three seasons. He coached for the California Angels (1976) and was the Mets' Gulf Coast League manager in 1983. With the parent team, he served as bullpen coach when New York won the 1986 World Series. He became a minor league catching instructor for the Mets in 1988. Retirement In retirement, Hoscheit returned to his native Nebraska, where he coached American Legion teams in Plainview, Nebraska for many years including a state championship team in 1982. His team included players - Aaron Arlt, Tommy Franke, Gene Ohlrich, Rick Ruth, Darin Arlt, Dave Doerr, Troy Wells, Eric Lueders, Rick Peterson, Greg Jareske, Phil Wendzillo, Bruce Knaak, Brian Betts, Scott Walker, Jim Larsen, Scott Born, Jeff Blunck, Joel Bessmer, and Jerry Schumacher. In 1983, he returned to the Mets to become their Gulf Coast League Manager in 1983 and went on to receive his 4th World Series Ring with the 1986 Mets as a bullpen coach.

The Allied forces were driven from the field. Prelude Erbprinz Charles William Ferdinand of Brunswick. During the autumn of 1760 Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, the commander of the allied army saw the French were threatening Hanover. To create a diversion he dispatched 20,000 men command by the Erbprinz of Brunswick to draw the French army away and to the west. The French commander prepared to defend the town of Wesel on the east bank of the Rhine burning the bridge over the Rhine at the mouth of the Lippe while Marquis de Castries hurried with extra reinforcements to relieve the garrison. The Prince of Brunswick set up a formal siege of Wesel building two pontoon bridges over the river. He resolved to meet de Castries' army round the Kloster Kampen area west of the river. Major General George Augustus Eliott commanded the approach vanguard, 2 squadrons of Prussian Hussars, the Royal Dragoons, the Inniskilling Dragoons along with the 87th and 88th Highlanders. The main attacking force comprised 2 battalions of grenadiers, the 20th Foot, the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, the 25th Foot, 2 battalions of Hanoverians and 2 battalions of Hessians. Behind the main body of the army was a force of cavalry, the 10th Dragoons and 10 squadrons of Hanoverian and Hessian cavalry. A reserve force of the 11th, 33rd and 51st Foot with 5 Hessian battalions lay some miles behind the main body of the army. Battle Marquis de Castries The battle began in the middle of the night when the army's vanguard drove the French out of Kloster Kampen convent and took the bridge over the canal. The sounds of the guns as the French resisted the attack alerted the main body of the French army of the attack. Dawn broke as the British and German Foot regiments moved into the attack, the Highlander regiments outflanking the French army which drove the French back. The Marquis de Castries brought up his reserves and rallied the retreating regiments then launched a counter- offensive against the allied foot. The French attack broke up the formation of the British and German regiments. The French drove back the British and German regiments back across the canal. The allied reserves were brought up but due to the lengthy distance this took time and the French pressed their assault. At the western end of the canal, Eliott led the three British cavalry regiments in a charge which disrupted the French advance and enabled the retreating allied foot to regain the North bank. The reserves formed a cordon which allowed the retreating allied foot to re-form. It was at this point which the Prince of Brunswick ordered the allies to retreat over the Rhine. However, upon reaching the river he discovered that the pontoon bridge needed for his crossing had been swept away and two days were needed to effect the crossing. The French did not follow up on their success, permitting the allies to complete their retreat over the Rhine. Aftermath The Allied defeat caused disappointment in Britain where many had expected better news, following the large expansion of Frederick's army. It led some to question Ferdinand's leadership of the Allied army, although Ferdinand had been leading an outnumbered force during the campaign and would go on to win further victories at Warburg, Vellinghausen, and Wilhelmsthal, successfully defending Hanover from invasion.

She was a founding member of the popular Russian rock band Nochnye Snaipery, providing vocals and playing violin. Presently she is a founding member of \\"Surganova i Orkestr\\" band. Early years Svetlana Surganova was born in Leningrad, on 14 November 1968. She has never seen her real parents: her biological mother refused her after birth. When Svetlana was three years old, she was adopted by Liya Davydovna Surganova, Candidate of Biological Sciences. Svetlana Surganova started writing her own songs at 14. In the 9th grade she created her first musical band \\"Камертон\\" (\\"Camerton\\"). Her second band, \\"League\\", was formed during the period of study in a medical college. From 1988 to 1996, Surganova had been a member of \\"Нечто иное\\" (\\"Something Else\\") band. As a sessional musician she took part in recording an album with \\"КузяBAND\\" from Munmansk.Рен ТВ Какие люди Светлана Сурганова \\"Nochnye Snaipery\\" In 1993 Svetlana Surganova and Diana Arbenina established an acoustic duet \\"Nochnye Snaipery\\". In 1998 Surganova and Arbenina released their first album \\"Капля дегтя в бочке меда\\", (\\"Drop of a tar in the ointment\\") which became popular on Russian radio stations such as \\"Европа Плюс\\", \\"Радио Балтика\\", \\"Модерн\\", \\"Ностальжи\\" and \\"Русский шансон\\". In the end of 1998, women decided to change the style of the band from acoustic to electric. In 1999, 2 new members entered \\"Nochnye Snaipery\\". In the same year the band released their second album \\"Детский лепет\\" (\\"Baby talk\\"). The third album was \\"Рубеж\\" (\\"Frontier\\"). In autumn of 2002, Svetlana Surganova and Diana Arbenina released their last joint album \\"Цунами\\" (\\"Tsunami\\"). In December 2002 Surganova left the band. \\"Surganova i Orkestr\\" After leaving \\"Nochnye Snaipery\\" in 2002, Svetlana Surganova left the band and started her own, \\"Surganova i Orkestr\\" (\\"Сурганова и оркестр\\"; \\"Surganova and orchestra\\"). In 2003, their first album \\"Neuzheli ne ja\\" (“Неужели не я”, “Isn’t it me”) was released and sold more than 100,000 copies. In 2004, they were nominated for “the best live-band of the year” award and won the prestigious FUZZ magazine award for “Pesnya goda” (“Песня года”). Songs from \\"Neuzheli ne ja\\", especially \\"Murakamii\\"Светлана Сурганова - Мураками (“Мураками”, “Murakami”) and \\"Bol’no\\" (\\"Больно\\", \\"In pain\\") topped the music charts for months. The band shot a music video \\"Korabli\\" (\\"Корабли\\", \\"Ships\\"), that rotated successfully on MTV and MUZ-TV (МУЗ-ТВ), and went on the first tour through the country. After the first album, later albums included: “Zhivoj” (\\"Живой\\",”Alive”) in 2003, “Vozljublennaja Shopena” (“Возлюбленная Шопена”, “Chopin’s beloved”) in 2005, “Sol” (“Соль”, “Salt”) in 2007. Those repeated the success of the first one: almost all the songs became hits and topped the music charts . The magazine “Russian Reporter” included the album “Sol” into the top 10 of the best rock-albums of Russia. Surganova i Orkestr is one of the most actively touring bands of Russia, performing across the Far East, Western Europe and the United States. Definition coined by Svetlana Surganova for a music played by a group \\"Surganova i Orkestr\\" is \\"VIP-Punk-Decadence\\", which stands for: V - aesthetically pleasing scenic image of an elegant man who tends to think, the image of the artist, combining experience and unsophistication; P- energetic and sincere treatment, with swashbuckling charm and a high degree of self-irony; D - a sophisticated and intelligent, but at the same time accessible poetry, that affects the timeless themes and have their analog works of writers of the Silver Age and the poetics of French symbolism, and a Drive that forces public to \\"stand on their heads\\" and to barely held themselves in chairs. Personal life Svetlana Surganova never concealed her homosexuality. In various interviews, Diana Arbenina (a second founder of Nochnye Snaipery), said that she was dating Surganova. The women were together for 9 years, but in 2002 they eventually broke up and Surganova left the band to create her own. In 2008 she started advocating Side by Side (film festival) and became one of the judges.http://www.bok-o- bok.ru/community/opinions/ In Interviews Svetlana Surganova mentions that she believes in God. According to her, there is one God, but different religions have different presentations of “God”. In 1996 Surganova found out that she had sygmoid colon cancer. At the age of 27 she underwent a clinical death. In May 2018 Surganova was banned from visiting Ukraine for three years due to violating Ukrainian law by entering Crimea through Russia in 2016; two years after the region was annexed by Russia.State border guards refuse entry to Ukraine to Surganova, ex-soloist for 'Night Snipers, Interfax-Ukraine (14 May 2018) References External links * Official Surganova i Orkestr site in Russian * Unofficial Svetlana Surganova & Diana Arbenina fansite in Russian * Official Nochnye Snaipery site in Russian Category:1968 births Category:Colorectal cancer survivors Category:Lesbian musicians Category:LGBT musicians from Russia Category:LGBT singers Category:LGBT songwriters Category:Living people Category:Russian female singers Category:Russian rock singers Category:Singers from Saint Petersburg Category:Russian female singer- songwriters Category:Russian female composers ","title":"Svetlana Surganova"},{"id":"11731299","text":"The Specified Subject Condition (SSC) is a condition proposed in Chomsky (1973) which restricts the application of certain syntactic transformational rules. In many ways it is a counterpart to the Tensed-S Condition (TSC) (proposed in the same paper), applying to non-finite clauses and complex DPs which are not covered by the TSC. The rule was formalized as follows, where a \\"specified subject\\" is a lexical subject i.e. a subject with semantic content, like a proper noun, a complex DP, or a pronominal: Specified Subject Condition (SSC) “No rule can involve X, Y in the structure ... X ... [α... Z ... - WYV ...] ... where Z is the specified subject of WYV in α.” (Chomsky 1973: 239) The SSC (along with the TSC) therefore had implications for the field which later became known as binding theory. In conjunction with a simple rule of disjoint reference (which stipulated that any pronoun following an NP antecedent in the same sentence has disjoint reference with it, the rule applying anywhere unless it is blocked), co-reference is acceptable in the following sentences, because the SSC blocks application of this disjoint reference rule: (1) The footballersi want [the fans to love themi] (2) The footballersi laughed at [the fan’s pictures of themi] The TSC (which essentially blocks transformational and binding rules from applying across clause boundaries) would not block disjoint reference in (1) and (2), hence the need for the SSC. Replacing the pronouns in (1) and (2) with reciprocals shows how the SSC blocks the application of each movement, hence the impossibility of the reciprocals referring back to \\"The footballers\\" in (3) and (4): (3) * The footballersi believe [the supermodel to love each otheri] (4) * The footballersi laughed at [the supermodel’s pictures of each otheri] Notice that when the DP-internal subject is removed, each movement is not blocked from applying: (5) The footballersi laughed at the pictures of each otheri An empirical problem for the SSC is the failure of disjoint reference to apply in a sentence like (6), where there is no specified subject blocking its application: (6) The footballersi laughed at the pictures of themi The SSC also made correct predictions for certain binding data with respect to control verbs. The notion of \\"specified subject\\" needs to be nuanced to include PRO with respect to an antecedent which does not control it; however, PRO is not a specified subject with respect to an antecedent which does control it. In the case of an object control verb like \\"persuade\\" therefore, we predict the following pattern: (7) *Wej persuaded Billi [PROi to kill each otherj] (8) Billj persuaded usi [PROi to kill each otheri] (9) Wej persuaded Billi [PROi to kill usj] (10) *Billj persuaded themi [PROi to kill themi] In (7) PRO is a specified subject with respect to \\"we\\" (as it is controlled by \\"Bill\\" not by \\"we\\"); the SSC therefore applies to this sentence and each movement from \\"we\\" to \\"other\\" is blocked. Similarly, in (9), PRO is a specified subject for \\"we\\", thus blocking disjoint reference, so that \\"we\\" can corefer with \\"us\\" in the non-finite clause. In (8), PRO is not a specified subject for \\"us\\", allowing each movement from \\"us\\" to \\"other\\"; similarly in (10), disjoint reference between \\"us\\" in the matrix clause and \\"us\\" in the non-finite clause is not blocked by a specified subject, because \\"us\\" in the matrix clause controls PRO. Similar examples hold for subject control verbs like \\"persuade\\": *Theyi promised Billj [PROi to kill themi] vs Billj promised themi [PROj to kill themi], and subject raising verbs like \\"seem\\": *Theyi seem to Billj [ti to like themi] (where the trace is not specified with respect to \\"we\\" thus disjoint reference applies) vs Wei seem to Billj [ti to like himj] (where the trace is specified with respect to \\"Bill\\" so that disjoint reference is blocked). The way the SSC accounted for binding as well as movement phenomena (such as the each movement examples above), was influential for much subsequent research which tried to reduce binding and movement to the same set of principles (see Kayne (2002) for a recent implementation). The subsequent binding conditions A and B of Chomsky (1981) essentially replaced the SSC (along with the TSC), and it is no longer a part of the toolkit of current researchers.

Asphalt rubber is the largest single market for ground rubber in the United States, consuming an estimated , or approximately 12 million tires annually. Use of rubberized asphalt as a pavement material was pioneered by the city of Phoenix, Arizona in the 1960s because of its high durability. Since then it has garnered interest for its ability to reduce road noise. In 2003 the Arizona Department of Transportation began a three-year, $34-million Quiet Pavement Pilot Program, in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration to determine if sound walls can be replaced by rubberized asphalt to reduce noise alongside highways. After about one year it was determined that asphalt rubber overlays resulted in up to 12 decibels of in road noise reduction, with a typical reduction of 7 to 9 decibels. Arizona has been the leader in using rubberized asphalt, but California, Florida, Texas, and South Carolina are also using asphalt rubber. Tests are currently underway in other parts of the United States to determine the durability of rubberized asphalt in northern climates, including a 1.3 mile stretch of Interstate 405 in Bellevue and Kirkland, Washington and a handful of local roads in the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 2012, the State of Georgia issued a specification for the use of rubber-modified asphalt as a replacement for polymer-modified asphalt. In Belgium, tests in the ring of Brussel and in the F1 circuit of Francorchamp (see the film by Jean-Marie Piquint RUBBERIZED ASPHALT for Esso Belgium).In Belgium, tests by Esso Belgium in the ring of Brussel and in the F1 circuit of Francorchamp, belgian film by Jean-Marie Piquint. Two quality control requirements are necessary when using asphalt rubber: (a) crumb rubber tends to separate and settle down in the asphalt cement and therefore asphalt rubber needs to be agitated continuously to keep the rubber particles in suspension and (b) crumb rubber is prone to degradation (devulcanization and depolymerization) and thus lose its elasticity if asphalt rubber is maintained at high temperatures for more than 6-8 hours. This means asphalt rubber must be used within 8 hours after production.Hanson, D.I., J.A. Epps, and R.G.

Origins Winsloe was named for John Hodges Winsloe, the owner of the majority of the land in the area during the mid-19th century. The community developed as a farming settlement on the northern boundary of the township of Queens Royalty, however the construction of the Malpeque Road between the colonial capital of Charlottetown to the south and the shire town of Prince County in Prince Royalty to the northwest saw Winsloe became a service centre on the stagecoach route. The arrival of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1872 saw Winsloe placed on the mainline between Charlottetown and Summerside and later Port Borden. The construction of Route 2 during the later part of the 20th century sealed Winsloe's fate as a developing suburb to Charlottetown. 20th Century Its status was upgraded to a village in 1971 and several subdivision developments were created in the community during the 1970s-1990s. On April 1, 1995 the village was amalgamated into the city of Charlottetown. Since 1995 the village of Winsloe has been developing rapidly.

Its average annual temperature is about 27 degrees Celsius. History Alonso de Ojeda The area was sighted by Alonso de Ojeda on his voyage of 1499. The site, inhabited by Island Caribs, has been mentioned since 1515. Its name comes from the indigenous cacique Igoroto who led the indigenous tribes of the area. Also its name is derived from the Latin origin voice \\"La Higuera\\", that is the plant whose fruit is the fig; In addition, it is named after an indigenous tree of this area known as Higuerote, similar to the fig, but smaller and used in America, for the construction of boats. It was a place of refuge for buccaneers and pirates, and from its waters came the smuggling of cocoa from the Barlovento area. The place has been a permanent settlement since the middle of the 19th century  Administration and politics   Territorial organization  * Parish of the Municipality Brión: Higuerote besides being capital, also is parish of the Municipality Brión, besides Tacarigua de Brión and Curiepe. * Cabo Codera Cape and Puerto Francés: The Carenero Bay, just minutes from Higuerote, is the main supplier of oil and its derivatives from Caracas. Higuerote and Carenero are bathed by brown waters due to the proximity of large river mouths. The majority of its inhabitants are of African origin so they have a very rich musical tradition. One of the best-known festivals in this region is Las Tamboras. To the west it find Cabo Codera Cape and beyond this we find El puesto de Víctor, the beaches of Chirere, La Cangrejera and finally the Aricagua river. The Cabo Codera Cape works like a giant barrier that prevents that the brown waters that pour out of the rivers diffuse towards the west, explaining thus the bright blue color that has the sea in the zone of El Banquito. About 30 km north of the city is the Farallón Centinela, a large white and solitary rock of 3200 m² that emerges 28 meters above the sea. Main sights Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen church The Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen church, along with Plaza Bolívar square, the modern Plaza Francisco de Miranda square (inaugurated in 2009) and the different beaches of the town, are among the attractions of this town, which celebrates its patron saint festivities each year from 16 to 22 July, with different religious events and celebrations.

Both participated in numerous actions during the First Sino-Japanese War and in the Russo-Japanese War. Background The revolutionary design of the “Elswick” protected cruiser, initially developed as a private-venture by Armstrong Whitworth in the mid-1880s, and implemented in the cruiser Esmeralda for the Chilean Navy (subsequently purchased by Japan as ) was of great interest to Japan because of her high speed, powerful armament, armor protection and relatively low cost, especially since the Imperial Japanese Navy lacked the resources at the time to purchase modern pre-dreadnought battleships.Brooke, Warships for Export page 58-60 This was a period of increasing tension with the Empire of China prior to the First Sino-Japanese War, and Japan lacked the ships necessary to counter the Chinese Beiyang Fleet. Pioneering Japanese naval architect Sasō Sachū requested that Armstrong Whitworth make modifications to the Esmeralda design to customize it for Japanese requirements, and two vessels, Naniwa and Takachiho were ordered under the 1883 fiscal year budget, by Naval Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi. When completed, Naniwa was considered the most advanced and most powerful cruiser in the world.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy;Evans, Kaigun, p. 15. However, the extremely fast development of technology, weaponry and armor in this field of ship design meant that the supremacy of this design was very short. Naniwa and Takachiho together cost £546,980. Prince Yamashina Kikumaro attended the launch, and afterwards had dinner with Baron William Armstrong, who made a toast that \\"the ship was destined to the service of a country which was likely never to come into collision with our own peace- loving country\\". Design Layout as shown in Brasseys Naval Annual 1888 The hull of the Naniwa-class cruiser was a typical flush deck with high freeboard to improve seaworthiness. The design came with a ram attached to the reinforced bow, which was standard practice for the time.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860–1905, p. 226-227. As built, her main armament initially consisted of two L/35 Krupp cannons mounted individually on rotating platforms in the bow and stern, with a supply of 200 rounds per gun. Secondary armament was initially six L/35 Krupp cannons mounted in semi- circular sponsons on the main deck, with 450 rounds per gun. Light armament included six QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss guns, ten 1-inch Nordenfelt guns and four 11-mm, 10-barrel Nordenfelt guns In addition, there were four Whitehead torpedo tubes mounted on the main deck. After the First Sino-Japanese War, both Naniwa and Takachiho were re-armed with eight Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval guns in order to increase stability and standardize on ammunition for the fleet. Propulsion was by two horizontal two-stage steam reciprocating engines, two-shafts, with six boilers, yielding a speed of and a range of at based on its capacity for 800 tons of coal. Ships in class Two Naniwa-class cruisers were purchased from Armstrong Whitworth in England. Naniwa was lost before the start of World War I, Takachiho was lost soon after hostilities commenced.Brooke, p. 58-60. ; Ordered in 1883, launched 18 March 1885, and completed 1 December 1885, Naniwa played a major role in the First Sino- Japanese War, notably at the Battle of Pungdo and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. During the Russo-Japanese War she was present at the opening Battle of Chemulpo Bay, but was subsequently assigned a reserve role. After the war, she was lost after running aground on 26 July 1910 on the coast of Urup, in the Kurile Islands . ; Ordered in 1883, launched 16 May 1885, and completed 1 December 1885, Takachiho participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in the First Sino-Japanese War. In the Russo-Japanese War she was present at the opening Battle of Chemulpo Bay, but was subsequently assigned a reserve role. In World War I, while covering the invasion of German-held Tsingtao, she was torpedoed by the German torpedo boat S90 on 14 October 1914 and sank with the loss of 271 officers and men.

The method is used in various processes such as meetings, seminars, workshops and conferences. This visual process is conducted by a graphic facilitator. An early paper in the field of graphic facilitation was “Explicit Group Memory” by Geoff Ball, who “discovered” that a shared picture supported group learning or, more importantly, a lasting memory in the group. \\"A Graphic Facilitation Retrospective\\" by David Sibbet tells the story of these early pioneers in the field who were inspired by architects (with understanding of large imagery), designers, computer engineers (who started to cluster information in a new way), art and psychology. He describes that what at a glance “just” looked like graphics was so much more: “It was also a dance, and story telling, since the facilitator was constantly in physical motion, miming the group and its communication with movement, as well as commenting on the displays….” Graphic recorders combine the skills of a note-taker and an artist to visually represent information communicated orally. Example services include creating visual summaries of meeting dialogue, conference speakers' presentations and providing graphic facilitation for organizations doing strategic planning. The terms \\"graphic facilitator\\" and \\"graphic recorder\\" are often used interchangeably by those practicing the technique, which can occasionally cause confusion among those looking for a professional in the field for hire.

Beautiful Lies You Could Live In was the sixth album credited to American psychedelic folk group Pearls Before Swine, and their fourth on Reprise Records. It was released in 1971. Like its predecessor City of Gold, the album was credited to Tom Rapp and Pearls Before Swine, rather than solely in the group's name. By this time, Rapp was usually recording as, in effect, a solo singer-songwriter, supported by his wife Elisabeth and by session musicians. However, the move towards presenting Rapp as a solo artist happened at the same time as the group Pearls Before Swine - which, since its formation in 1965, had never previously appeared live - was beginning its first concert tour in 1971. The other members of the 1971 touring band - Mike Krawitz (piano), Gordon Hayes (bass) and Jon Tooker (guitar) - all played on Beautiful Lies, but were not specifically differentiated as band members from the session musicians. The sessions took place in New York and Woodstock, presumably in early 1971, and featured musicians of the calibre of Amos Garrett (guitar), Bob Dorough (piano), and Billy Mundi (drums). The album has a more orthodox folk rock (or country rock) sound than earlier Pearls Before Swine records, with electric guitars and drums more prominent. It also contains several of Tom Rapp's most beautiful and evocative songs, such as \\"Snow Queen\\", \\"Island Lady\\", and \\"Freedom\\", together with a cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Bird On A Wire\\". The album concludes with a brief setting of A. E. Housman's poem, \\"Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries\\", sung by Elisabeth. Reverting to the group's practice of using classic art images on their album covers, the sleeve design shows the 19th century Pre-Raphaelite painting \\"Ophelia\\" by John Everett Millais. Beautiful Lies was in effect the last album recorded by Rapp for the Reprise label, although a further album, Familiar Songs, was issued by the company without Rapp's knowledge or approval. Beautiful Lies was issued on CD in 2003 as part of the Jewels Were the Stars compendium of Pearls Before Swine's first four Reprise albums.

He also believes he is a natural prankster, as he attempts funny and difficult pranks on the second to last day of school (known in the book as \\"Prank Day\\"). He is somewhat vain, believing himself to be irresistible to girls despite being rejected repeatedly by his crush, Jenny Jenkins. He believes he is a brilliant sports player despite his lack of athletic abilities. He also thinks of himself as a genius despite his below-average grades. Nate spends much of his time in detention, in the art room drawing comics, or playing drums for his rock band, Enslave the Mollusk, which also comprises his friends Francis, Teddy, and Artur. Nate is desperate to own a dog as he is a dog person who is ailurophobic, but rarely gets his wish, as his father does not want to own a dog. He also has ailurophobia, and hates Figure skating and egg salad, but loves Cheez Doodles. Surprisingly, Nate's most well-known talent is that he is a skilled chess-player, to the complete confusion of his friends and family. Nate is also well known as being able to detect vibes. He even tried to teach Chad Applewhite this ability but failed. Nate is also known for having a very accurate sense of smell. * Martin Earl \\"Marty\\" Wright: Nate's father, a bald, overweight divorcée who lost his job in the eighth novel of the series (eventually getting another one). Like his son, he is somewhat clueless about his failings and considers himself a professional musician despite his indescribably horrible singing voice and initially poor steel-string guitar playing, an athlete despite his inherent laziness, and an expert golfer, though he constantly cheats or loses his ball. He is a health nut and always tries to hand out healthy alternatives to candy on Halloween (raisins, prunes, trail mix, etc.), which are always rejected by trick-or-treaters. He also was the hero of the first Mud Bowl, according to Big Nate: Blasts Off. His first name was first stated on July 28, 2005. * Ellen Wright: Nate's fifteen-year-old sister. Unlike Nate, Ellen is responsible and hardworking and loves cats and figure-skating, and egg salad. Nate is always compared to Ellen in school by teachers. She is Nate's consistent rival, and he enjoys playing pranks on her. Ellen also dates Gordie on and off, who works at the comic book store, Klassic Komix and has previously dated Kenny Smithson, the captain of the football team and is considered her crush. They briefly broke up before reconciling. She is 4 years older than Nate. *Francis Butthurst Pope: Nate's number #1 friend, Francis is very intelligent, and this upsets his friends from time to time. He has a gap between his teeth and lets people bully him often. Nate and Francis frequently make fun of each other, but he states that this is how they operate. He also likes to read ‘The Book of Facts’ which annoys Nate and Teddy. Nate and Francis often argue about cats vs dogs as Francis is a cat person, he also has a cat named Pickles. Contrary to Nate's feelings for them, Francis is friendly with both Mrs. Godfrey and Artur. Francis plays the electric guitar in Enslave the Mollusk and dates Sheila Stapleton. *Teddy √ Ortiz : Nate's number \\"1A\\" best friend, Teddy is a comedic character who frequently cracks jokes and annoys Nate. Like Francis, Teddy likes Artur and is a member of Enslave the Mollusk. His middle name is the square root symbol since his parents are math teachers. In Big Nate: Flips Out, it is revealed that he is fluent in Spanish. He plays the musical keyboard in Enslave The Mollusk. In 1994, it is revealed that Teddy is half Mexican, and half Puerto Rican. In 1994, it is revealed that over the summer Teddy gets to live in Mexico with his grandparents, however, this stopped happening in 1996. Teddy also knows a lot about the Civil War, as his dad is an expert of the Civil War, and has been teaching him facts since he was a baby.

It was the location of an iron works, and siding and stopping place on the Eastern Railway. It was named in 1907 and was a siding on the Chidlow to Northam section of the railway. The origin of the name is from nearby Woondowing Spring which is an Aboriginal word thought to come from Ngwundow, meaning \\"to lie down\\". Following the decision of the government to construct the blast furnace and wood distillation plant (to produce charcoal) in 1943 at Wundowie, plans were made to develop the townsite. Lots were surveyed in 1946 and the town was gazetted in 1947. The design of the town was based on the concepts of the 'garden city movement' of town planning. This is reflected in its street pattern, subdivision layout, location of land uses, open space and the civic core of the town. Construction of the town was by the Western Australian Department of Housing. The charcoal iron works commenced production in 1948, and the railway station was opened in 1949. In 1974 the plant was sold to Agnew-Clough Ltd and upgraded. By 1979, a shortage of hardwood timber resulted in the saw mill being closed. In 1981 iron production ceased. The railway line was continued for a while from Northam to service Wundowie - after the main closure of the Chidlows route and the opening of the Avon Valley route in 1966.

Once again, the French threatened Hanover, so the Allies manoeuvered around the French, surrounded the invasion force, and forced them to retreat. It was the last major action fought by Brunswick's force before the Peace of Paris brought an end to the war. Background France had made a number of attempts to invade and overrun Hanover since 1757, hoping to occupy the Electorate and use it as a bargaining counter to exchange for the return of French colonies captured by the British. The Allied army under the Duke of Brunswick had prevented them from taking Hanover - and by 1762, aware that the war was likely to draw to a close, the French had decided on a final thrust to try to defeat Brunswick and occupy Hanover. The battle Ferdinand had advanced and outflanked the French on both flanks, nearly encircling them. An attack on the French center held by Stainville's command was particularly effective, with one column engaging his front, another striking his rear, inflicting some 900 casualtiesSavory, Reginald, His Britannic Majesty's Army in Germany During the Seven Years War, Oxford University Press, 1966, p.373. and forcing 2,700 to surrender. Aftermath The result is viewed as victory for the Allied forces. It ended the last French hopes of overrunning and occupying Hanover before the armistice that ended the war, and the Treaty of Paris. The Anglo- German forces advanced and captured Cassel in November, but by then the preliminaries of peace had been signed.

Overview VAR is used most frequently in high value applications. Essentially it is an additional processing step to improve the quality of metal. Because it is both time consuming and expensive, a majority of commercial alloys do not employ the process. Nickel, titanium,D.Zagrebelnyy, Modeling macrosegregation during vacuum arc remelting of Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al alloy and specialty steels are materials most often processed with this method. The conventional path for production of titanium alloys includes single, double or even triple VAR processing.Titanium: Past, Present, and Future (1983) Use of this technique over traditional methods presents several advantages: *The solidification rate of molten material can be tightly controlled. This allows a high degree of control over the microstructure as well as the ability to minimize segregation *The gases dissolved in liquid metal during melting metals in open furnaces, such as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen are considered to be detrimental to the majority of steels and alloys. Under vacuum conditions these gases escape from liquid metal to the vacuum chamber. *Elements with high vapor pressure such as carbon, sulfur, and magnesium (frequently contaminants) are lowered in concentration. *Centerline porosity and segregation are eliminated. *Certain metals and alloys, such as Ti, cannot be melted in open air furnaces Process description The alloy to undergo VAR is formed into a cylinder typically by vacuum induction melting (VIM) or ladle refining (airmelt). This cylinder, referred to as an electrode is then put into a large cylindrical enclosed crucible and brought to a metallurgical vacuum (). At the bottom of the crucible is a small amount of the alloy to be remelted, which the top electrode is brought close to prior to starting the melt. Several kiloamperes of DC current are used to start an arc between the two pieces, and from there, a continuous melt is derived. The crucible (typically made of copper) is surrounded by a water jacket used to cool the melt and control the solidification rate. To prevent arcing between the electrode and the crucible side walls, the diameter of the crucible is larger than that of the electrode. As a result, the electrode must be lowered as the melt consumes it. Control of the current, cooling water, and electrode gap is essential to effective control of the process, and production of defect free material. Ideally, the melt rate stays constant throughout the process cycle, but monitoring and control of the vacuum arc remelting process is not simple.DA Melgaard, RG Erdmann, JJ Beaman, RL Williamson - 2007 This is because there is very complex heat transfer going on involving conduction, radiation, convection (within the liquid metal), and advection (caused by the Lorentz Force). Ensuring the consistency of the melt process in terms of pool geometry, and melt rate is pivotal in ensuring the best possible properties from the alloy. Materials and applications The VAR process is used on many different materials, however certain applications almost always use a material that has been VAR treated. A list of materials that may be VAR treated include: *Stainless Steel **15-5 **13-8 **17-4 **304 **316 *Alloy Steel **9310 **4340 & 4330+V **300M **AF1410 **Aermet 100 **M50 **BG42 **Nitralloy **16NCD13 **35NCD16 **HY-100 **HY-180 **HY-TUF **D6AC **Maraging steels **UT-18 **HP 9-4-30 *Titanium **Ti-6Al-4V **Ti-10V-2Al-3Fe **Ti-5Al-5V-5Mo-3Cr *Invar *Nitinol *Nickel superalloys **Inconel alloys **Rene alloys **RR1000 *Zirconium *Niobium *Platinum *Tantalum *Rhodium Note that pure titanium and most titanium alloys are double or triple VAR processed. Nickel-based super alloys for aerospace applications are usually VAR processed. Zirconium and niobium alloys used in the nuclear industry are routinely VAR processed. Pure platinum, tantalum, and rhodium may be VAR processed.

Whiting, the lyrics by Raymond B. Egan in 1918. Written during the Great War, the song tells of the parting of a soldier and his sweetheart. The title comes from the final line of the chorus: :Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu, :When the clouds roll by I'll come to you, :Then the skies will seem more blue, :Down in lovers lane my dearie, :Wedding bells will ring so merrily, :Every tear will be a memory, :So wait and pray each night for me, :Till we meet again. As Whiting's daughter Margaret tells it, the song was intended for a 1918 contest at a Detroit theater. Dissatisfied with the result, Whiting threw the manuscript in the trash. His secretary retrieved it and showed it to their boss, publisher Jerome Remick, who submitted it in the contest, where it won top honors. The song gained widespread popularity in Canadian traditional music circles as a result of its use as the closing number for the CBC television program Don Messer's Jubilee.Canadian Music Encyclopedia, Don Messer It continues to be a standard ending number for Old Time dances across the country. In 1919, it was the number 1 song of the year as recorded by Henry Burr and Albert Campbell.Paas, John Roger (2014). America Sings of War: American Sheet Music from World War I.

The name of the poem is only known due to Snorri's citation of it in Gylfaginning (chapter 5): { :[...] ok var sá nefndr Ymir, en hrímþursar kalla hann Aurgelmi, ok eru þaðan komnar ættir hrímþursa, svá sem segir í Völuspá inni skömmu: :7. :Eru völur allar :frá Viðolfi, :vitkar allir :frá Vilmeiði, :en seiðberendr :frá Svarthöfða, :jötnar allir :frá Ymi komnir.Gylfaginning, Guðni Jónsson's edition. :And that man is named Ymir, but the Rime-Giants call him Aurgelimir; and thence are come the races of the Rime-Giants, as it says in Völuspá the Less: :- :All the witches :spring from Witolf, :All the warlocks :are of Willharm, :And the spell-bearers :spring from Swarthead; :All the ogres :of Ymir come.Gylfaginning in translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916), at Sacred texts. } The additional stanzas that remain appear in Hyndluljóð. In his translation of Hyndluljóð, Henry Adams Bellows comments that the preserved fragment of Völuspá hin skamma shows that it was a \\"late and very inferior imitation of the great Voluspo\\", and he dates it to the twelfth century.

He remained permanent judge of Supreme Court from 2002 to 2010. He was born in Lahore on 13 January 1945. His late brother Chaudhary Muhammad Farooq had served as the Attorney General of Pakistan. His younger brother Chaudhary Asad-ur-Rehman, a politician, was elected as a Member of the National Assembly three times on a Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) ticket and served as a Federal minister as well. Education After receiving his early education in different schools of the Punjab, he matriculated from Central Model School, Lahore, and joined Government College, Lahore from where he migrated to Gordon College, Rawalpindi, on account of his father’s posting in the Federal Ministry of Law. At Gordon College, Rawalpindi, he was the captain of the college tennis team. He was judged the best English and Urdu debater of the college. He also became the editor of the college magazine, \\"The Gordonian\\" and was later elected, un- opposed, as the president of the college Minerva Club. After graduation, he joined the Punjab University Law College at Lahore, where he became secretary of the Punjab University Law Society, and the editor of the college magazine, \\"Al-Mizan\\". He was declared the best English debater of 1968 in the Punjab University after winning the \\"Krishan Kishore Grover Goodwill Gold Medal Declamation Contest\\". He graduated in 1968 with a top honours for best all round activities in academics, sports and debates. Khalil ur Rehman Ramday himself was appointed Advocate General of Punjab in 1987 when PML-N leader Mian Nawaz Sharif was Chief Minister of the province. Before that he was serving as Deputy Advocate General of province since 1984. He was among a large number of judges who were appointed in different high courts just before 1988 elections in anticipation of PPP's victory. The move was seen to be aimed at denying PPP government right to nominate judges in the courts. Personal life Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday (where Ramday is a sub caste of Arains) was married to the daughter of former chief justice of Pakistan Justice Yaqoob Ali Khan, Quratulain Ramday (late). Mrs. Ramday was the chairperson of the Asia Chapter of Asia Pacific Cultural Center for UNESCO (ACCU) and the Punjab chapter of All Pakistan Women Association (APWA). She was also a Member of the Board of Governors of Queen Mary College Lahore. Mrs. Ramday died on Saturday, 9 January 2010, and was survived by her son, Mustafa and daughter, Aamena. Aamena is married to Mr. Muhammad Aurangzeb, son of Justice Ramday's elder brother Mr. Muhammad Farooq, a former Attorney General of Pakistan. Aamena and Zeb have twin children, Ismaeel and Jahan Ara, born on 5 January 1997. The twins are studying in the United World College of Singapore where Zeb is working as the CEO Global Corporate Bank Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan. Mustafa is married to Aasma, the daughter of Ch. Ahmad Saeed, who was the chairman of Service Group of Pakistan, and a former chairman of Pakistan International Airlines.

He astounded his peers by the unique intricacy of his minute works, which he completed unaided. For models, he preferred to create models derived from ancient statuary, and his small studio contained drawings, carvings and models taken from the antique, or by the artists of the previous centuries. In pieces of wood the size of a nut, he was able to carve stories with multiple figures and objects, such as a passion scene of Christ, complete with a crown of thorns on the head of Christ. Or he would carve a surface full of tiny figures of two armies in battle, thin arabesques intertwining across the scene. he carved on another piece, a prodigious hunting scene with multitude of hunters and horses, and forests with parts that seem slimmer than a spider's web in a network of almost surpassing subtlety.

In his book Your Competent Child (1995, in English 2001) he argues that today's families are at an exciting crossroads because the destructive values — obedience, physical and emotional violence, and conformity — that governed traditional hierarchical families are being transformed. The book has been translated into 13 languages and has popularized current ideas of non-authoritarian parenting.  Biography  Jesper Juul was born in Vordingborg, Denmark. He had several jobs before entering higher education at Marselisborg Seminarium where he graduated as a teacher of history and religion in 1970. He then enrolled in studies of the history of ideas at the University of Aarhus. He financed his studies working at the resort Bøgholt in Viby J, and dropped out of studies to work full-time with social treatment. At an internal course he became acquainted with U.S. psychiatrist Walter Kempler and they became friends, finally leading to him forming the Kempler Institute of Scandinavia in 1979 with Kempler as a director. A few years later Juul had to take over leadership of the institute and would hold this position until 2004. He has no peer- reviewed scientific articles listed in the American psychological database PsycINFO, however his books have been cited numerous times in academic publications.

Often also they were connected to national \\"scholae\\" (ancestors of Rome's seminaries), where the clergymen were trained. The churches and their riches were a sign of the importance of their nation and of the prelates that supported them. Up to 1870 and Italian unification, these national churches also included churches of the Italian city states (now called \\"regional churches\\"). Many of these organizations, lacking a purpose by the 19th century, were expropriated through the 1873 legislation on the suppression of religious corporations. In the following decades, nevertheless, various accords – ending up in the Lateran Pacts – saw the national churches' assets returned to the Roman Catholic Church.

(Azerbaijani language for What?) The Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy occurred in response to a cartoon drawn by the cartoonist Mana Neyestani and published in the Iranian holiday-magazine Iran-e-jomee on 12 May 2006. The cartoon describes nine methods of dealing with cockroaches by depicting a Persian-speaking child and a cockroach. During the first method, when the cockroach does not understand him, the child decides to talk to the cockroach in \\"cockroach language\\" using different forms of soosk (Persian word for cockroach). But the cockroach does not even understand its \\"own\\" language and replies by saying \\"Namana?\\" (\\"What?\\"). As namana is a word which originates in the Azerbaijani language, the cartoon has been interpreted by some as an insult to Iranian Azerbaijanis. Contents of the article The article which the cartoons accompany is entitled \\"How to Stop the Cockroaches from Making Us into Cockroaches?\\" It is a satirical article in a children's weekly newspaper. The cartoon depicts nine methods of dealing with cockroaches including dialogue, oppression, elimination, population control, and violence. The text of the paragraph in the first image describes the first method, translated as follows: Persian. The child proceeds to speak in \\"cockroach language\\" to the cockroach, but the cockroach does not understand him and replies \\"Namana?\\" (\\"What?\\"). Namana is originally an Azerbaijani-Turkic word, but is also sometimes used in Persian as a slang. In other sections of the article where the violence option is entertained, the cockroach speaks in Persian to the child. The article's use of the keywords \\"dialogue\\" (گفتمان) and \\"violence\\" (خشونت ورزی), plus discussions about problems understanding the language of the \\"cockroaches,\\" can be interpreted as tacit references to the reformist's nomenclature in contrast to the language of the conservatives in Iran. The famous reformist motto \\"dialogue between civilizations\\", used by Iran's former president Mohammad Khatami, was a source of criticism among the intelligentsia, because they questioned how it could be possible to have such a dialogue between Iran and the western civilizations when it was not even possible to have a dialogue and mutual understanding between reformist and conservative Iranians. Aftermath The publication of the cartoon caused controversy among Iranian Azerbaijanis for allegedly comparing them to cockroaches. It was deemed by some people as part of a long-standing chauvinistic attitude towards Iranian Azerbaijanis among parts of the Persian- speaking majority. The controversy resulted in massive protests in May 2006 throughout the predominantly Azerbaijani-populated cities of Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil, Zanjan and Naghadeh (Sulduz) and a number of smaller towns. After violent reactions from the Iranian police, the initially peaceful protests turned violent in most cases, with protesters throwing stones and damaging government related properties.Iran's Azeri minority protests mocking cartoon Iran Focus Amnesty International claims that \\"hundreds, if not thousands, were arrested and tens of Azerbaijani-Turks reportedly shot and killed by the security forces,\\"Amnesty International.

Allegations of foreign interference Emad Afrough, head of the Majlis Cultural Commission at the time, said that pan-Turkists were involved in creating the tensions. Other members of the Iranian government blamed it on the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom, suspecting the incitement of ethnic strife in Iran. It was alleged that the United States is conducting covert operations in Iran and is allied with Iran's neighbor, the Republic of Azerbaijan. Abbas Maleki, a senior research fellow at Harvard University and former deputy foreign minister of Iran, supported this thesis, stating: \\"I think that when President Bush says all options are on the table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr Mahmudali Chehregani, one of the pan-Turkist leaders agitating for a separatist Azeri agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the Defense Department.\\" Reuel Marc Gerecht, reportedly a former CIA operative, had stated in the early 1990s: \\"Accessible through Turkey and ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, eyed already by nationalists in Baku, more westward-looking than most [of] Iran, and economically going nowhere, Iran's richest agricultural province was an ideal CIA [covert action] theater.\\" According to Touraj Atabaki, well-known expert on Iranian Azerbaijanis, there might be some truth behind the Iranian government's allegations of a foreign plot, yet the responsibility for the unrest lies first and foremost with the central government.

Most species are native to North America, although one is also present in northern Eurasia. There are 23 species in the genus, including 1 natural hybrid. The name was first applied by Alexandre de Cassini in 1820. The name is derived from Ancient Greek (), meaning \\"wide\\", and (), meaning \\"few\\", perhaps in reference to the small number of relatively wide ray florets. Description All species within the genus are perennials that grow from in height. They have rhizomes which can either be long, slender or short and thick or sometimes cormoid, all of which often become woody. The stems can be ascending to erect and are typically simple, though they are in rare cases they branch proximally, i.e. near the point of attachment. They can be glabrous to more or less densely hairy, and are generally eglandular, meaning they lack glands, though they can sometimes be stipitate-glandular, meaning glands are present on a stipe. The leaves are always alternate. Both basal and cauline leaves, i.e. leaves growing on the stem, are present, and these may be either sessile or petiolate, meaning lacking or having a leaf stalk. The blades of the leaves may be anything from cordate, ovate, obovate, elliptic, or oblong in shape to spatulate, oblanceolate, or lanceolate. They are usually gradually reduced distally, meaning they taper towards the apex. The leaf margins can be entire or serrate, i.e. toothed, though they may also occasionally be spinulose-serrate, that is being toothed with small spines. The leaf surfaces are glabrate to hairy and are usually eglandular, though they may sometimes be stipitate-glandular. The capitula, or flower heads, are radiate and typically appear in corymbiform arrays, but in rare cases they may be borne singly. The involucres, the bracts at the base of the flower heads, are cylindro-campanulate, meaning bell-shaped, to broadly campanulate and measure from 4 to 14 and exceptionally to 16 mm long by 4 to more than 25 mm wide. The phyllaries, that is the individual bracts that make up the involucres, number from 20 up to 140 in 3 to 7 series and are single nerved. They are usually rounded adaxially, i.e. towards their upper-side, but are sometimes low-keeled. Their shape is unequal and broadly ovate or oblong to oblanceolate, lanceolate, or linear. The bases of the phyllaries are indurate, or hardened, and rarely wholly foliaceous, meaning leaf-like in appearance. Their margins are narrowly scarious, meaning membranous and dry, or occasionally herbaceous, and often ciliolate, i.e. having minute cilia. The apices, or terminal ends, are obtuse to acute, while the surfaces are glabrous (hairless), somewhat strigillose (with stiff, slender bristles), puberulent (very finely haired), scabrellous (having small rough hairs), strigoso-villous (with stiff soft hairs), or villous (having soft shaggy hairs), and occasionally they are more or less stipitate-glandular. The receptacles, the stalks that attach to the florets, are flat to slightly convex, pitted and epaleate, i.e. lacking palea, dry scale-like bracts. The ray florets, the long petal-like appendages, number between 5 and 60 and are pistillate and fertile. Their corollas are white to purple in colour and coil at maturity. The disc florets, the tiny flowers at the center of the flower structure, number from 8 all the way up to 260 and are bisexual and fertile. Their corollas are yellow, though they become purple at maturity, and may be barely to abruptly ampliate, meaning enlarged. The corolla tubes are either shorter or longer than the throats, which are funnelform to campanulate. They have 5 lobes, which are usually erect to spreading or occasionally somewhat reflexed, and are deltate, triangular, or lanceolate. The style-branch appendages are lanceolate in shape. The fruits are cypselae, which are cylindro-obconic (cylindrically reverse-conical) to fusiform (tapering at both ends) in shape, and are often somewhat compressed. They have 7 to 12 and exceptionally up 18 nerves with surfaces that are eglandular and glabrous or sparsely to densely strigillose. The pappi are persistent and are made up of 35 to 70 or more bristles that are reddish, orange, cinnamon, tawny, tan, yellowish, or pinkish in colour. The bristles are unequal, soft to stiff, barbellate (finely barbed) or barbellulate (barbed with diminutive barbs) and often apically somewhat clavate, or club shaped. They appear in 2 to 4 series. ; Species References Category:Asteraceae genera Category:Astereae ","title":"Eurybia (plant)"},{"id":"11731933","text":"The Japanese wrinkled frog (Glandirana rugosa) is a species of true frog native to Japan and introduced to Hawaii in the late 19th century.

Early background One of eleven children, Hemming was born in Los Angeles, California on March 1, 1937. He attended El Monte Union High School in California before joining the United States Marine Corps in 1954. Hemming left the Marines in October 1958 and the following year traveled to Cuba where he gave help to Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces. In January 1959 Hemming met Lee Harvey Oswald at the Atsugi Naval Air Station in Japan. Hemming complained that Oswald boasted too much about his inside knowledge. For instance, upon their first meeting; Oswald tried to impress Hemming by showing off how much he knew about Hemming's background and mission - somebody in an intelligence capacity had briefed Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald sort of teased Hemming with this information. So, Hemming did not particularly enjoy the company of Oswald from the start. Like many young Americans, including Frank Sturgis, David Ferrie and Harry Dean, Hemming joined an American effort to overthrow the Batista regime through the efforts of Fidel Castro. When Castro proved to be a Communist, and subjected some Americans to firing squads, most Americans \\"switched sides\\" and this included Gerry Patrick Hemming. who, in 1961, established Interpen as a means to attack and weaken the Castro regime. Other members of Interpen reportedly included Loran Hall, Roy Hargraves, William Seymour, Lawrence Howard, Steve Wilson, Howard K. Davis, Edwin Collins, James Arthur Lewis, Dennis Harber, Bill Dempsey, Dick Whatley, Ramigo Arce, Ronald Augustinovich, Joe Garman, Edmund Kolby, Ralph Schlafter, Manuel Aguilar and Oscar Del Pinto. Interpen Hemming was a leader of Interpen, or Intercontinental Penetration Force, a group of anti-Castro guerrillas who trained at No Name Key in the early 1960s. Declassified FBI files show that the agency had an informer within Interpen. His code name was MM T-1. In one document dated June 16, 1961, it said that MM T-1 had \\"been connected with Cuban revolutionary activities for the past three years\\". One document dated May 12, 1961, claims that Allen Lushane of Miami \\"had made a trip to Texas to recruit Americans for some future military action against the Government of Cuba\\". The document adds that the \\"first training camp was established by Gerald Patrick Hemming with Dick Watley and Ed Colby running the camp.\\" In an interview that he gave to John M. Newman on January 6, 1995, Hemming claimed that the FBI informer was Steve Wilson. This group of experienced soldiers were involved in training members of the anti-Castro groups funded by the Central Intelligence Agency in Florida in the early 1960s. When the government began to crack down on raids from Florida in 1962, Interpen set up a new training camp in New Orleans, Louisiana. When this work came to an end in 1964 Hemming was employed in the construction industry in Miami. Hemming and Lee Harvey Oswald According to Victor Marchetti, he was also Lee Harvey Oswald's case officer at then-secret NAF Atsugi.The Spotlight (August 14, 1978 issue) Gerry Hemming has granted long interviews with several writers working on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. These include Anthony Summers (Conspiracy), Noel Twyman (Bloody Treason) and John M. Newman (Oswald and the CIA). Some researchers believe that a combination of Interpen members and anti-Castro Cubans were involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This included Hemming, James Arthur Lewis, Roy Hargraves, Edwin Collins, Steve Wilson, David Sanchez Morales, Herminio Diaz Garcia, Tony Cuesta, Eugenio Martinez, Virgilio Gonzalez, Felipe Vidal Santiago and William \\"Rip\\" Robertson. Arms trading Gerry Hemming was arrested on August 23, 1976 for the illegal transfer of a silencer and drug smuggling. It seems that this was the point that he began talking about his past work with the CIA. He told one reporter: \\"All of a sudden they're accusing me of conspiracy to import marijuana and cocaine. Hey, what about all the other things I've been into for the last 15 years, lets talk about them. Let's talk about the Martin Luther King thing, let's talk about Don Freed, Le Coubre, nigger-killers in bed with the Mafia, the Mafia in bed with the FBI, and the goddamn CIA in bed with all of them. Let's talk about all the people I dirtied up for them over the years.\\" 1978 conviction and acquittal Hemming was convicted by a Miami jury of conspiracy to import marijuana. In 1978 he was sentenced to six months in prison by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler. Hemming was released on appeal bond and the conviction was later overturned. In August, 1978, Victor Marchetti published an article about the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the Liberty Lobby newspaper, The Spotlight. In the article Marchetti argued that the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had obtained a 1966 CIA memo that revealed Hemming, E. Howard Hunt, and Frank Sturgis had been involved in the plot to kill Kennedy. Marchetti's article also included a story that Marita Lorenz had provided information on this plot. On April 14, 1980, Hemming was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. He was held on $200,000 bond in Palm Beach County, Florida. He claimed that he had not smuggled Quaaludes, but was establishing his bona fides with drug traffickers so he could penetrate their networks. Hemming told Alan J. Weberman that he was working for Mitchell Werbell III and Lucien Conein. Hemming was sentenced to 35 years in prison with a minimum mandatory sentence of three years but the conviction was later overturned on appeal. Hunt decided to take legal action against the Liberty Lobby. In December, 1981, he was awarded $650,000 in damages. Liberty Lobby appealed to the United States Court of Appeals. It was claimed that Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, had offered a clearly erroneous instruction as to the law of defamation. The three-judge panel agreed and the case was retried. This time Mark Lane defended the Liberty Lobby against Hunt's action. Lane eventually discovered Marchetti’s sources. The main source was William Corson. It also emerged that Marchetti had also consulted James Angleton and Alan J. Weberman before publishing the article. As a result of obtaining depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, G. Gordon Liddy, Stansfield Turner, and Marita Lorenz, plus a skillful cross-examination by Lane of E. Howard Hunt, the jury decided in January, 1985, that Marchetti had not been guilty of libel when he suggested that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated by people working for the CIA. Lane states that during a later meeting they had, Hemming corroborated the details of the assassination which were outlined during the trial.

It long sported the largest pillar-less hotel ballroom in the city. Numerous large events have been regularly hosted at the Hilton Washington, including the annual dinners of the White House Correspondents Association and the Radio and Television Correspondents Association, as well as the National Prayer Breakfast. During the 1960s and 1970s, the hotel hosted a number of big musical acts for concerts in their large ballroom, including The Doors and Jimi Hendrix. In 1972 it was home to the first International Conference on Computer Communications which demonstrated new ARPANET technology. The hotel was the site of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley, Jr. on March 30, 1981. The attempt occurred at the hotel's T Street NW exit. As a result, the hotel is sometimes colloquially referred to by locals as the \\"Hinckley Hilton\\".Harry Jaffe, Prepping for the protests, Salon.com, April 15, 2000Barry Svrluga, National Pastime (2006), excerpted atDenis Dutton, The White House Press Correspondents’ Dinner, Sunday Star Times (New Zealand), May 7, 2006 The hotel was renamed the Hilton Washington in 1998.https://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Hotels-Capitalize-On- Capital-s-Convention-Center It was purchased in June 2007 by an investment firm jointly owned by former professional basketball star Magic Johnson.Charlotte Business Journal From 2009-2010 it underwent a $150 million renovation.

The work is being conducted with industrial, academic and government collaborators. Overview Schematic of a dual-mode scramjet indicating engine processes and components. Source: NASA LangleyThe goal of the Hy-V project is to conduct a flight experiment of a scramjet engine at Mach 5 using a sounding rocket. Currently the project is in its design and test phase and plans to launch a flight test in the future. In a dual-mode scramjet, combustion can either occur at subsonic or supersonic speeds, or a mixture of the two. The experiment will be performed at speed of Mach 5 because significant effects on mode transition occur at this speed. In this particular case, the mode transition will occur inside the scramjet when the vehicle's airspeed reaches Mach 5. Teams of students, both undergraduate and graduate, and faculty from the member universities of the Virginia Space Grant Consortium are involved in the project and are collaborating with aerospace industry, NASA, and the Department of Defense.Goyne, CP, Cresci, D and Fetterhoff, TP, “Short Duration Propulsion Test and Evaluation (Hy-V) Program,” International Journal of Hypersonics, Vol 1, No 2, 2010, pp. 77-92 Payload Design The current payload design will enable researchers to conduct two separate experiments by having two separate scramjet ducts. One will resemble the geometry of the University of Virginia's supersonic wind tunnel and the other will be a variation of this geometry. The data recorded while in-flight will be used to better understand dual-mode scramjet (DMSJ) combustion and to make better numerical methods of predicting mode-transition processes. It will also provide a set of comparative data to help understand and isolate differences with wind tunnel data. UVA Wind Tunnel The University of Virginia's Supersonic wind tunnel was built in the late 1980s inside the Aerospace Research Laboratory (ARL). Previously housing classified gas centrifuge research, the ARL became endorsed purely for research by the National Space Council in 1989. Shortly thereafter, the wind tunnel was constructed in order to aid in the development of the National Aero-Space Plane, also known as the X-30, which was projected to fly at Mach 25. The wind tunnel is not only known for its supersonic combustion capabilities, but also for its unique design. The air is heated electrically, rather than through combustion processes, thus eliminating contaminants introduced by combustion. Additionally, the wind tunnel is capable of operating for an indefinite period of time, allowing unlimited duration scramjet testing. In order to recreate the conditions inside the DMSJ combustor, the geometry of the experimental scramjet will be a full-scale copy of that of the DMSJ combustor.

Famed for her beauty and the lavishness of her hospitality, she was a leading figure in pre-Revolutionary Russian society. In 1882, she married Count Felix Felixovich Sumarokov-Elston, who served briefly as General Governor of Moscow (1914–1915). Zinaida is best known as the mother of Prince Felix Yusupov, the murderer of Rasputin. She escaped revolutionary Russia and spent her remaining years living in exile. Early life Princess Zinaida Nikolayevna Yusupova was the only surviving child of Prince Nicholas Borisovich Yusupov (12 October 1827 – 31 July 1891), Marshal of the Imperial Court, and Countess Tatiana Alexandrovna de Ribeaupierre (29 June 1828 – 14 January 1879). Prince Yusupov was a patron of the arts, and first served in the chancery of Tsar Nicholas I. Zinaida's mother, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress, was the daughter of Comte Alexandre de Ribeaupierre and his wife Catherine Mikhailovna Potemkina, a niece of Prince Potemkin. Zenaida Yusupova by V. Bobrov, 1889. Princess Zinaida's only brother, Prince Boris Nicholaievich Yusupov, died in early childhood. She also had a younger sister, Princess Tatiana Nicholaievna, who died young, in 1888. As the only surviving child of a distinguished, highly placed, and vastly rich couple, Zinaida enjoyed great favor at court. She was the greatest Russian heiress of her day, and the last of her line, the House of Yusupov. The Yusupovs, a family of Crimean Tatars origin, were very wealthy, having acquired their vast fortune generations earlier. Their properties included four palaces in St. Petersburg, three palaces in Moscow, 37 estates in different parts of Russia (Kursk, Voronezh and Poltava). They owned more than 100,000 acres (400 km²) of land and their industries included sugarbeet factories, brick plants, saw-mills, textile and cardboard factories, iron-ore mines, flour mills, distilleries and oil fields on the Caspian Sea. Princess Zinaida was known for being intelligent, hospitable, socially skilled, and beautiful; qualities that would last her late into her life.  Marriage  The Yusupov family in 1902: Prince Felix, Prince Nicholas, Count Felix Felixovich Sumarokov-Elston and Princess Zinaida. Princess Zenaida in her Moika Palace, 1900. This portrait is often considered Valentin Serov's masterpiece. Prince Nikolai Borisovich Yusupov was hoping that Zinaida would make an illustrious marriage, but at a reception organized to pair her with the Prince of Battenberg, Zinaida met and fell in love with Count Felix Felixovich Sumarokov-Elston (5 October 1856, Saint Petersburg, Russia – 10 June 1928, Rome, Italy), son of Count Felix Nikolaievich Sumarokov- Elston.Papi, Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court, p. 176 Felix was a lieutenant in the Horse Guards. They were married on 4 April 1882 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Princess Zinaida and her husband had four sons, two of whom survived childhood: Prince Nicholas Felixovich Yusupov (1883–1908) and Prince Felix Felixovich Yusupov (1887–1967). After his father-in-law died, in 1891, Felix was granted special permission by Tsar Alexander III to carry the title Prince Yusupov as well as that of Count Sumarokov-Elston and to pass them both to his and Zinaida's heir. Prince Felix was appointed adjutant to the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich in 1904 and commanded the Cavalry of the Imperial Guards. In 1914 he was appointed Governor General of Moscow, a position he held briefly. The couple had their own mansion in Liteyny Avenue, where the Institute of Economic Relations, Economics and Law is currently located. She owned the palace at Nevsky Prospect 86 as well. Later life As a leading figure in pre-Revolutionary Russian society, Zinaida was famed for her beauty, elegance and the lavishness of her hospitality. In her book of memoirs, Ladies of the Russian Court, Meriel Buchanan (1886–1959), daughter of the British ambassador at the Russian court, described Princess Zinaida as: \\"Delicate in health, easily exhausted, essentially feminine, she was not one of those capable, competent woman, able to run big charitable organizations. She was always ready to give, freely and generously, to anyone who appealed to her, to do what she could to help anyone in distress, to lend her name, her house, her resources for any worthy cause, but she shrank from publicity, from all the complications of executive administration\\". Princess Zinaida Yusupova served as lady-in-waiting to both the Empress Maria Feodorovna and later Empress Alexandra Feodorovna and was a close friend to Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna wife of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. In private, she became a severe critic of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchess Elisabeth's sister. Zinaida's eldest son, Nicholas, age 26, was killed in a duel in 1908, an event which cast a shadow over the rest of her life. In February 1914, Zinaida's younger son, Felix, married Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, Tsar Nicholas II's only niece. Felix fell from grace for participating in the murder of Grigori Rasputin. Following the Russian Revolution, she lost her vast wealth. She and her husband moved to Rome living under reduced circumstances. After his death she moved to Paris, where she died in 1939. Her descendants are as follows: * Prince Felix Felixovich Yusupov (11 March 1887 – 27 September 1967), Count Sumarakov Elston, who married Irina Alexandrovna Romanova (21 March 1895 – 30 August 1970), and had one daughter: ** Irina Felixsovna Yusupova (21 March 1915 – 10 August 1983), who married Count Nikolai Dmitrievich Sheremetev (28 October 1904 – 5 February 1979), and had one daughter: *** Countess Ksenia Nikolaevna Sheremeteva (born 1 March 1942), who married Ilias Sfiris (born 20 August 1932), and had one daughter: **** Tatiana Sfiris (born 28 August 1968) who married firstly Alexis Giannakoupoulos (born 1963), div. with no issue, and later married Anthony Vamvakidis and had issue: ***** Marilia Vamvakidis (born 17 July 2004) and Yasmine Xenia Vamvakidis (born 7 May 2006).https://web.archive.org/web/20140625093624/http://yusupov- palace.ru/ru/yusupovi The Australian conductor Alexander Briger claims descent from her,Clive Paget, \\"Russians adore Aussie maestro with link to Rasputin's killer\\", Limelight, April 2017, p. 15 though this is unproven. His stated genealogy does not match the actual family relationships. Jewel collection As the head of one of the most important noble families in Russia, she also inherited a vast fortune, which meant owning the largest collection of historical jewels in Russia, second only to that of the vaults of the Russian Imperial Family. She was in possession of 21 Tiaras, 255 Brooches, 42 Bracelets, 210 kilos of assorted Objet d'art and hundreds of thousands of loose gems., About The Jewels of Princess Yusupouv Some of the famous gems were: The mid-16th century La Pelegrina pearl, \\"The Polar Star Diamond\\" (41.28 carat diamond), The \\"La Regente Pearl\\" (fifth largest pearl in the world), The 17th century \\"Ram’s Head Diamond\\" (a 17.47-carat diamond), The 17th century \\"Sultan of Morocco Diamond\\" (35.67 carats, fourth largest Blue diamond in the world), The 17th century \\"Diamond Earrings of Marie Antoinette\\" (two 34.59 carat diamonds), The \\"Blue Venus Statuette Sapphire\\" (4-inch-tall sapphire statuette of the goddess Venus atop a large Spinel) and also The 15th century \\"Ruby Buddha\\" (70+ carat Ruby statue). Following her narrow escape during the Russian Revolution, she was forced to leave all her financial assets in Russia: her entire jewel collection was hidden in a secret vault in Moika Palace in hopes that she would retain their use in their return to Russia, however all were found and sold by the Bolsheviks in 1925. During her exile she took only the major jewels, and those of historical importance, and had them sold to fund her family's life. Ancestry Notes Bibliography  *Buchanan, Meriel.

He is best known for writing a comprehensive and influential history of Armenia in three volumes, which has remained a starting point of reference for scholars since the time of its publication. Career Chamchian was born in Istanbul and trained as a jeweler by the imperial jeweler Mikayel Chelebi Duzian. He joined the Mkhitarian Congregation in Venice in 1762. In 1774 he was appointed instructor of Armenian language in the monastery. In 1779 he wrote Kerakanutiun Haykazian Lezvi (Քերականութիւն Հայկազեան լեզուի, Grammar of the Armenian Language). By 1784 he had finished his Patmutiwn Hayots i Skzbane Ashkharhi Minchev tsam diarn (Պատմութիւն Հայոց; Armenian history from the beginning of the world to the year 1784). The work marks the beginning of Romantic Armenian nationalism. Chamchian provided a chronology for the Armenian patriarchs (as laid down by Movses Khorenatsi in his History of Armenia), dating Hayk's battle with Belus, and thus the formation of the Armenian people, to August 11, 2492 BC. He is also the source for the traditionally accepted date for the foundation of official Christiandom in Armenia as AD 301. In 1795 he was sent back to Constantinople as the resident Mekhitarian representative.

It was out of service between December 12–15, 1960, and replaced with a third station between 1960 and 1961.LIRR station history (TrainsAreFun.com) Until 1960, the station had a platform on each side of the four-track Main Line, though almost all trains that stopped ran to and from Hempstead. As part of the grade crossing elimination the junction of Main Line and Hempstead Branch was moved west of Bellerose. The two lines remain closely parallel between Jamaica and Floral Park. The platform was placed between the two Hempstead Branch tracks. The station is served by the and the bus routes at Jericho Turnpike, and local taxis do stop here. Station layout The station has one eight-car-long high-level island platform that serves the Hempstead Branch. The Port Jefferson, Ronkonkoma, Oyster Bay, and Montauk branch trains pass through the station without stopping, via. the paralleling Main Line tracks.

OpenEpi was developed in JavaScript and HTML, and can be run in modern web browsers. The program can be run from the OpenEpi website or downloaded and run without a web connection. The source code and documentation is downloadable and freely available for use by other investigators. OpenEpi has been reviewed, both by media organizations and in research journals.OpenEpi online « Technology, Health & DevelopmentGreat free tools for teaching statistics Education IT ZDNet.com The OpenEpi developers have had extensive experience in the development and testing of Epi Info, a program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and widely used around the world for data entry and analysis. OpenEpi was developed to perform analyses found in the DOS version of Epi Info modules StatCalc and EpiTable, to improve upon the types of analyses provided by these modules, and to provide a number of tools and calculations not currently available in Epi Info. It is the first step toward an entirely web-based set of epidemiologic software tools. OpenEpi can be thought of as an important companion to Epi Info and to other programs such as SAS, PSPP, SPSS, Stata, SYSTAT, Minitab, Epidata, and R (see the R programming language). Another functionally similar Windows-based program is Winpepi. See also list of statistical packages and comparison of statistical packages. Both OpenEpi and Epi Info were developed with the goal of providing tools for low and moderate resource areas of the world. The initial development of OpenEpi was supported by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Emory University. The types of calculations currently performed by OpenEpi include: * Various confidence intervals for proportions, rates, standardized mortality ratio, mean, median, percentiles * 2x2 crude and stratified tables for count and rate data * Matched case-control analysis * Test for trend with count data * Independent t-test and one-way ANOVA * Diagnostic and screening test analyses with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves * Sample size for proportions, cross-sectional surveys, unmatched case-control, cohort, randomized controlled trials, and comparison of two means * Power calculations for proportions (unmatched case-control, cross-sectional, cohort, randomized controlled trials) and for the comparison of two means * Random number generator For epidemiologists and other health researchers, OpenEpi performs a number of calculations based on tables not found in most epidemiologic and statistical packages. For example, for a single 2x2 table, in addition to the results presented in other programs, OpenEpi provides estimates for: * Etiologic or prevented fraction in the population and in exposed with confidence intervals, based on risk, odds, or rate data * The cross-product and MLE odds ratio estimate * Mid-p exact p-values and confidence limits for the odds ratio * Calculations of rate ratios and rate differences with confidence intervals and statistical tests. For stratified 2x2 tables with count data, OpenEpi provides: * Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and precision-based estimates of the risk ratio and odds ratio * Precision-based adjusted risk difference * Tests for interaction for the risk ratio, odds ratio, and risk difference * Four different confidence limit methods for the odds ratio. Similar to Epi Info, in a stratified analysis, both crude and adjusted estimates are provided so that the assessment of confounding can be made. With rate data, OpenEpi provides adjusted rate ratio’s and rate differences, and tests for interaction. Finally, with count data, OpenEpi also performs a test for trend, for both crude data and stratified data. In addition to being used to analyze data by health researchers, OpenEpi has been used as a training tool for teaching epidemiology to students at: Emory University, University of Massachusetts, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Morehouse College, Columbia University, University of Wisconsin, San Jose State University, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, University of Washington, and elsewhere. This includes campus-based and distance learning courses. Because OpenEpi is easy to use, requires no programming experience, and can be run on the internet, students can use the program and focus on the interpretation of results. Users can run the program in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian. Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed and the developers respond to user queries. The developers encourage others to develop modules that could be added to OpenEpi and provide a developer’s tool at the website. Planned future development include improvements to existing modules, development of new modules, translation into other languages, and add the ability to cut and paste data and/or read data files.

It was the first novel in his unfinished The Human Predicament trilogy. Plot summary The novel opens in 1923. The protagonist, a young Welsh aristocrat named Augustine Penry-Herbert, discovers the body of a young girl and is incorrectly suspected of having something to do with her accidental death. Augustine decides to leave England and visit distant relations in Germany. He falls in love with his cousin Mitzi amidst the rise of Nazism, including the Munich Putsch. At the end of the novel, Mitzi, who has lost her sight, enters a convent and Augustine returns to England. Background Richard Hughes was cadet in training when the 1918 armistice was signed and spent World War II as an Admiralty bureaucrat; it was this experience that caused him to write The Human Predicament. In order to adequately mix his fictional characters with historical figures, Hughes relied on firsthand accounts and family papers from German relatives and friends, including distant relation Baroness Pia von Aretin (whom he acknowledges in the 1961 US edition of the novel) and Helene Hanfstaengl, who had been a friend of Hitler’s in the early 1920s. Hughes also gives an explanation for his unconventional description of the Munich Putsch saying that his narrative \\"is based on a vivid contemporary account by an actual Nazi participant, a Major Goetz. This account was contained in a letter to a friend dated 26th November, 1923, which some weeks later found its way into the German press.\\" Publication History The Fox in the Attic was originally published in 1961 by Chatto & Windus: London as v. 1 of The Human Predicament trilogy, and then in the United States by Harper & Brothers: New York. This was 23 years after Hughes's previous novel, In Hazard: A Sea Story, and 33 years after A High Wind in Jamaica, which was a best seller in the United Kingdom and America. It was published the following year in Sweden (Stockholm: Norstedt) as Räven på vinden. The second novel in The Human Predicament trilogy, The Wooden Shepherdess, was published in 1973 by Chatto & Windus: London; it carries on the story to 1934 and the Night of the Long Knives. The third and final novel was left unfinished, but the completed twelve chapters were included in the 2000 New York Review of Books edition of The Wooden Shepherdess. Reception The Fox in the Attic was featured in the 2 February 1962 Life Guide section of Life Magazine. In this short blurb, Life introduced Hughes's attempt to write The Human Predicament trilogy, calling it a \\"vast, Tolstoyan novel sequence\\" while also saying of the first volume, \\"Hughes effectively interweaves the life of his hero...with the fortunes of top Nazidom.\\" References Category:1961 British novels Category:Chatto & Windus books Category:Harper & Brothers books ","title":"The Fox in the Attic"},{"id":"11732224","text":"Favorite Trick (April 20, 1995 – June 6, 2006) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who in 1997 became the first 2-year-old in twenty-five years to be voted United States Horse of the Year. Bred at Wintergreen Farm in Midway, Kentucky by Max Wood and his wife, Sylvia, Favorite Trick was out of the mare Evil Elaine. His sire was the successful sprint horse Phone Trick, who retired with a record of nine wins and a second in ten career starts. A descendant of the great Nearco through both his sire and dam, Favorite Trick was selected by trainer Patrick B. Byrne at an auction in February 1997 as a purchase for Joseph LaCombe. Lacombe had previously had owned several horses in partnership with others. Undefeated Horse of the Year Trained by Byrne and ridden by Pat Day in all his races, at age two Favorite Trick went undefeated in eight starts. He scored victories in major races such as the Hopeful Stakes and Breeders Futurity. He then capped off his year with a win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile after avoiding a near-collision on the first turn. He ran away from the field to win by five increasing lengths while setting a Breeders' Cup Juvenile record of 1:41.47. Favorite Trick's performances in 1997 earned him the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse, and he became the first two-year-old since Secretariat in 1972 to be voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Going into the 1998 racing season, many people made comparisons between the horses. Like Secretariat, Favorite Trick was the winterbook favorite for May's Kentucky Derby. However, some turf writers and other racing people noted that Favorite Trick had not clocked any remarkably fast times and that six of his wins had been at distances between five and seven furlongs, with both the Breeders Futurity and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at 1 1/16 miles. Since he was a son of a sprint sire, some believed that it remained to be seen if Favorite Trick could compete at the longer distances of the American Classic Races. Three-Year-Old racing season For 1998, Favorite Trick's conditioning was taken over by Bill Mott after Patrick Byrne accepted an offer to take over the stable of prominent Canadian horseman Frank Stronach. Under Mott, Favorite Trick opened his 3-year-old season with a win in the 7-furlong Swale Stakes at Florida's Gulfstream Park but in the Arkansas Derby, his first attempt at 1⅛ miles (9 furlongs), he tired near the end and suffered his first defeat, winding up third behind winner Victory Gallop. By the time parimutuel betting closed for the May 2, 1998, Kentucky Derby, Favorite Trick was the second choice behind the John R. Gaines colt Indian Charlie and slightly favored over the third choice, Overbrook Farm's Florida Derby winner, Cape Town. Starting from post position seven in the Derby, Favorite Trick moved up to fourth by the half-mile pole but fell back to wind up eighth in the fifteen-horse field behind the winning 8:1 outsider Real Quiet. Not raced in the Preakness or Belmont Stakes, Favorite Trick did not go back to the track until July 19, when he won the 8.5 furlong Long Branch Breeders' Cup Stakes at Monmouth Park. He followed that victory with an August 9 win in the 9 furlong Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga Race Course, then after a fifth place on the same track in the Grade II King's Bishop Stakes, he was sent to Keeneland Race Course, where in October he won the important Keeneland Breeders' Cup Mile Stakes. Favorite Trick's victory led to him being made the betting favorite in November's Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs, where he finished eighth in a field of fourteen to winner Da Hoss. Career as a sire Following his Breeders' Cup loss, Favorite Trick was retired to stud duty at Walmac International near Lexington, Kentucky. He later stood at Cloverleaf Farms II in Ocala, Florida and finally at JEH Stallion Station near Hondo, New Mexico, where he and five other horses died in a barn fire on June 6, 2006.Simons, Marc (2007) The Original Thoroughbred Times Racing Almanac 2008 Thoroughbred Times Company, Bowtie Press, Lexington, Kentucky, page 47, A modestly successful sire of both Thoroughbreds and American Quarter Horses, Favorite Trick sired 16 stakes winners.

Arts Engine will premiere its eleventh annual Media That Matters Film Festival on October 27, 2011. History Arts Engine began under the leadership of co-founders Katy Chevigny and Julia Pimsleur in 1997 when they formed a partnership to create social issue documentaries. These two engaged social activists developed the core values and beliefs that have informed all of the projects that make up Arts Engine's powerful mission today. Eleven feature-length documentaries have been created since 1997, winning prestigious awards, gaining national recognition, and, as was the case with the Emmy-nominated film Deadline, reaching audiences in the millions. In 2000, during the height of the internet boom, Chevigny and Pimsleur were among the first to realize that social issue filmmaking was taking a dramatic turn. A new culture was emerging that would entirely change the face of media from televised monologues to internet-driven dialogues. And electronically facilitated dialogue and distribution channels opened opportunities to build online communities where no community existed before. Committed to breaking down traditional hierarchies and status-markers, Arts Engine launched one of the few online commons for filmmakers and activists, called MediaRights.org, and created what is now the most comprehensive database of social issue documentaries in the nation, and possibly the world, with over 7,400 films registered. The success of this site led to the creation of the Youth Media Distribution Initiative (YMDi.org). They also developed and launched the Media That Matters Film Festival, one of the first online film festivals, and realized the incredible potential for online showcasing and distribution before many major festivals did. Now in its eleventh year, the festival reaches tens of thousands of people annually and hosts hundreds of internet pages of information with “Take Action Links” on everything from AIDS in Africa, to water rights in Michigan, to the youth vote, LGBT issues, and sustainability. The ballast for this intense activism from the early beginnings in 1997 to today is the belief that exemplary visual storytelling on social issues can make change. Big Mouth Films Big Mouth Films produces feature-length, social issue documentaries independently and in collaboration with numerous companies and organizations. Big Mouth is best known for the Emmy-nominated film Deadline. (A)sexual (2011) Facing a sex obsessed culture, a mountain of stereotypes and misconceptions, and a lack of social or scientific research, asexuals – people who experience no sexual attraction—struggle to claim their identity. (A)sexual follows the growth of a community that experiences no sexual attraction. In 2000, David Jay came out to his parents. He was asexual and was fine with it. And he was not alone. Studies show that 1% of the population is asexual. But in a society obsessed with sex, how do you deal with life as an outsider? Combining intimate interviews, verite footage, and animation with fearless humor and pop culture imagery, David and our four other characters grapple with this universal question and the outcomes might surprise you. (A)sexual made its world premiere at the Frameline Film Festival on June 18, 2011. Pushing the Elephant (2010) In the late 1990s, Rose Mapendo lost her family and home to the violence that engulfed the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She emerged advocating forgiveness and reconciliation. In a country where ethnic violence has created seemingly irreparable rifts among Tutsis, Hutus and other Congolese, this remarkable woman is a vital voice in her beleaguered nation's search for peace. Now, Rose is confronted with teaching one of her most recalcitrant students how to forgive — Nangabire, the daughter who remained behind. When war came to Rose's village, she was separated from Nangabire, then just five years old. Rose managed to escape with nine of her ten children and was eventually resettled in Phoenix, Arizona. Over a decade later, mother and daughter are reunited in the US where they must face the past and build a new future.

It was part of the campaign to disrupt the French line of communications by capturing Marburg, a French supply depot. The Anglo-Hanoverian force consisted of six Hanoverian and Hessian infantry battalions, some Hanoverian jägers, Luckner's light cavalry hussars and the British 15th Light Dragoons. The French force consisted of five infantry battalions from the German regiments of Royal-Bavarière and Anhalt, a regiment of hussars and some light troops. The British forces initially surprised the French force in camp as they sat down to lunch. The French hussars fled at the onset while two of the infantry battalions managed to form up before receiving the concentrated fire of the Hessian battalions. Glaubitz sent one battalion back to Marburg while he tried to withdraw to Kirchhain with the rest of his troops. Most of the escape routes were cut by Luckner and the light troops. The Anglo-Hanoverians ultimately captured over 1650 prisoners, mostly due to several charges by the British 15th Light Dragoons into the retreating French force. The victory was largely won by the well-handled British 15th Light Dragoons who suffered heavily with 125 of the 186 Allied casualties.

It is situated South of the Chirayinkeezhu Taluk (in the North-West of Thiruvananthapuram district). The nearest town is Attingal and Varkala. Tradition accords a remote antiquity to this temple. Its main deity is Bhadrakali (Goddess Durga). The Sarkaradevi Temple assumed a significant status for many reasons and rose to historical importance mainly with the introduction of the famous Kaliyoot festival by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the Travancore sovereign, in 1748. The Sarkaradevi Temple have some basic attachment with Nakramcode Devi Temple which located in Avanavanchery,Attingal. Ficus tree in front of Sarkaradevi Temple, Chirayinkeezhu, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala History Chirayinkeezhu Taluk being directly under the immediate administration of the Attingal, Kerala Swarupam, the Attingal Ranis where entrusted by the TravancoreRaja with the conduct of the elaborate festival of Kaliyoot. The Attingal Rani being related to the Travancore royal family through adoption from the Kolathunadu royal family. From the time of Venad Kings, had enjoyed independent rights in several respects over the neighbouring regions and temples and at times even over the entire Venad. Even the King Marthanda Varma annexed Attingal to Travancore, soon after ascending the throne Marthanda Varma decided to assume direct control over Attingal 'estate'. The Ranis seem to have been allowed to continue in their independent status in many respects. Hence it was no wonder that when the former decided to introduce Kaliyoot festival in the Sarkaradevi Temple of Chirayinkeezhu Division, he entrusted the responsibility to the Attingal Ranis, even though the finances came directly from the Travancore royal treasury. Old Sarkara Temple The Attingal Ranis in the turn bestowed the members of the military family of Ponnora Panickers (When two princesses were adopted from Kolathunad, some senior members of the Ponnara family are said to have accompanied them as bodyguards to Attingal, where the former were settled by the Venad Kings. The descendants of the family are still residing there, with the responsibility of supervising the grand festival. Even now the responsibility is continuing with the descendants of the Ponnara family. One of the most important peculiarities of this temple is that it is the only temple in South Kerala where such elaborate Kaliyoot festival is conducted. Another festival which makes the temple the center of attraction is the Meenabharani mahotswavam which is conducted for ten days in the month of March–April every year. Famous Malayalam Film Actor Prem Nazir donated an elephant to the Sarkara Devi Temple. Festivals Kaliyoot The chief festival in the temple is the festival of kaliyoot, which falls on the Malayalam month of kumbham (March). Kali, the Mother of goddess is the deity of farmers. It is evident from the inclusion of the fictitious interpretations of agricultural art traditions in the rituals of the art form of Kaliyoot. Kaliyoot is the dramatic presentation of the genesis of Bhadrakali and Darika the representatives of good and evil respectively, their confrontation and later the extermination of Darika in devotional terms and with rhythmic footsteps. Kaliyoot is a synthesis of older agrarian art tradition is a further established by the fact that the time chosen for performing Kaliyoot after Makara Koithu (the Malayalam month of Makaram corresponds to March and in the season of the second harvest season in Kerala. Koithu is a Malayalam term for harvest ) and that Kali appears under the guise of a pulaya (the pulaya caste is the traditional agricultural labouring community in Kerala.) girl in the Kali drama. The object of Kaliyoot festival is to offer the elementary harvest to the Amma (the divine Mother), the defender of the land. The ritual art of Kaliyoot was originally celebrated in North Malabar to propitiate Goddess Kali was brought to Travancore and that too to the Sarkara Temple by King Marthanda Varma (1729–1758). There is a historical legend connected with it. For expanding the domain of this kingdom, Marthanda Varma Maharaja tried to capture kayamkulam province several times.(A.P. Ibrahim Kunju, Rise of Travancore, A study of the Life and Times of Marthanda Varma). All his efforts were in vain and he felt disappointed. But he did not give away his ambition. His one and only motive was the defeat Kayamkulam Raja. With the unyielding desire he was forced to make another arrangement for a war. On his way to Kayamkulam it is said that he chose the big ground near the Sarkara temple to take rest. Kaliyoot Festival Learning the arrival of Maharaja in their mace, that leaders of the place or Karakkar and Kalarigurukkars (The grand teachers of military techniques at the Kalari.) assembled together to have a glimpse of the Maharaja. Hearing the Raja's stories of defeat at Kayamkulam, they suggested that the only way to his triumph was to offer a Kaliyoot to Sarkaradevi. In conformity with their suggestion the Maharaja decided to offer Kaliyoot to Sarkaradevi and finally became successful in the war. Kaliyoot festival is usually celebrated in the month of February/March.It is a 9 day long festival with rituals and traditional ceremonies conducted in the temple premises. The first 7 days ceremonies are dramatic visualisations of stories leading to the war between Bhadrakali and Darika. The ceremonies takes its peak with the 8th and 9th day ceremonies,\\"Mudi uzhichil\\" and \\"Nilathil poru\\" respectively. On the 8th day of ceremonies, Bhadrakali herself goes out in search of Darika, but returns at the end of the day without finding the demon king. This function is one of the most important ritual associated with the festival as on this day the deity offers blessings to the devotees directly. The famous \\"Nilathil poru\\"(ground fight) takes place at the 9th and last day of ceremonies which visualises the killing of demon king Darika by Bhadrakali and thus spreading the prevalence of truth over the evil. The 8th and 9th day functions in the Kali drama festival are a visual treat and the colorful ceremonies takes hours for completion. The men from the ponnara family are assigned with the kali, durga and darika costumes. It is believed that there is a basic text titled Kaliyoot Mahotmyam (It is said that the text composed by Kannassa Panicker.) authored by Kannasa Panicker ceremonies connected with Kaliyoot as a devotional offering. After the construction of the stage for the chief performance the pernu and the invoking of the spirit of the Goddess into lamps, the chief rites of the first days begin and ends with compromising talk between Bhadrakali and darika is known as \\"Mudithalam Thullal\\".http://www.sarkara.org/festivals.htm About Kaliyoot Festival https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquKeYGtHnQ Watch Kaliyoot video Meenabharani Festival The Meenabharani festival is the second great annual festival in the temple of Sarkara Devi Temple. This festival often falls on the occasion of the annual special poojaof Attavishesham. During the period of king Dharma Raja and his success or Marthanda Varma orders were given for the elaborate conduct of the festival and the expenses like paddy, incurred for the same were recorded.(Mathilakam Records, churana 937,ola, 1639, 1750–51, Kerala State Archives, Trivandrum) The festival of Meenabharani is celebrated for ten days and it is believed that on the tenth day the benevolent Goddess appears and showers her blessings on the devotees. The Meenabharani festival generally starts with Kodiyettu (flag hoisting), nine days before the auspicious day of Bharani which is considered as the birth star of Sarkaradevi. It ends on the tenth day with Arat (holy immersion) of the deity in the temple tank. There are very interesting ceremonies connected with this festival. On all days recital of the exploits of the Goddess is staged by special teams of people. On the ninth day an important function is conducted in this temple known as Pallivetta. It is believed that during this function Sarkara devi disappears from the temple and she went for hunting. The Goddess is taken in procession as for hunting with the accompaniment of five caparisoned elephants and firetorches to the Bhagavathy palace. Through this hunting she tried to avoid powers of malice and maintain peace and security in this vicinity. During the earlier period animal sacrifices were conducted along with this performance. However, animal sacrifices were avoided during the later periods. Now this function ends with the return procession of the deity and the cutting of a coconut with a bow and arrow. After that the ceremonial Arat of the deity is conducted. There are various stories passed on through generations about Sarkara temple. Most of the locals come together for the festival season. Chirayinkeezhu has a large number of expatriate workers. They all come together for Meenabharani irrespective of faith.

Johnston ordered Self to make a second rewrite just four weeks before shooting was to begin. Self also helped contribute additional rewrites during five weeks of reshooting in the spring of 2009. Self's second script had a long sequence in which the werewolf terrorizes London, and his climax for the film was originally much longer. In 2008, Johnston cut the London sequence from the film and asked Self to dramatically shorten the ending. But in the editing room, it was clear that these sequences needed to be retained. Self also helped with new material for the ending. Self's second rewrite ended with werewolf Lawrence Talbot surviving. But during reshoots, Self scripted an ending in which both werewolves (Sir John Talbot and Lawrence Talbot) die.

Occurrence It occurs across much of eastern and northeastern China, the Amur River valley in Russia, the Korean Peninsula, and most of Japan, although it does not occur on Hokkaidō. It has been considered the commonest of the true frogs on the Korean Peninsula, and has been hunted for food and used as an experimental animal. There is an introduced population in Turkmenistan. Habitat The dark-spotted frog is a relatively low-altitude species, not being found above 2200 m. It ranges across a variety of habitats, from deserts and bushland to meadows and forests, and is typically found in or near stagnant or slow-moving water. Although relatively tolerant of human interference, it is increasingly threatened by hunting and water pollution. Description Adult males measure about and females in snout–vent length. The dorsal colouration varies from grey to greyish-olive, olive, and green. There are usually large dark spots, a light mid-dorsal line, and two lines on dorso-lateral folds. The belly is white. The toes are webbed. Males have a paired vocal sac and nuptial pads on the first finger. Mating season occurs soon after hibernation. Maturation probably occurs at an age of two years, and the total life span may reach 13 years. The clutch size has been reported as 1800–3000 or 600–5000 eggs. The eggs are laid in shallow water.

After service overseas clearing mines after the Armistice, the ship was laid up until 1922 when she was transferred to the United States Department of Commerce for use by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Renamed USC&GS; Guide, the ship operated as a survey vessel along the West Coast of the United States for 17 years, making significant contributions to navigation, hydrographic surveying, and oceanography. In June 1941, Guide was transferred back to the Navy, converted into a salvage ship, and renamed USS Viking (ARS-1). As Viking, she worked primarily from bases in California until 1953, when she was sold for scrapping.  USS Flamingo  The first USS Flamingo (AM-32), a Lapwing-class minesweeper, was laid down on 18 October 1917 by the New Jersey Drydock and Transportation Company at Elizabethport, New Jersey. She was launched on 24 August 1918 and commissioned as USS Flamingo, Minesweeper No. 32, on 12 February 1919. Flamingo fitted out at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, and later shifted to Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, on 29 March 1919. The minesweeper performed various towing jobs and carried stores locally in the 3rd Naval District into the spring of 1919. On 10 April 1919, she suffered damage in a collision with an unnamed Panama Railroad Company tug, and she underwent repairs at Port Richmond, Staten Island. Shifting to the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter, Flamingo began fitting out for \\"distant service.\\" Flamingo departed Tompkinsville on 18 May 1919 bound for the Orkney Islands. Proceeding via Boston, Massachusetts, she arrived at Kirkwall, Scotland, on 5 June 1919 to begin her tour of duty with the United States Minesweeping Detachment, North Sea. Along with U.S. Navy submarine chasers, chartered British naval trawlers, and fellow Lapwing-class minesweepers, Flamingo participated in the clearing of the North Sea Mine Barrage. Laid by the U.S. Navy after the United States entered World War I, the barrier had served as a formidable obstacle for German submarines based at North Sea ports. By 1919, however, the barrage merely hampered the resumption of peaceful commerce. On 23 June 1919, Flamingo transported officers and men from Kirkwall to Inverness, Scotland, and returned to her base in the evening carrying supplies for the detachment flagship, (Destroyer Tender No. 9).Flamingo then performed tug duty at Kirkwallcbetween 25 June and 7 July 1919. On 11 July 1919, she departed to assist in clearing Group 11 of the mine barrage in the second phase of the fourth clearance operation conducted by the Minesweeping Detachment. The first days were uneventful. On 15 July, Flamingo anchored for the night, as was usual practice, to the north of the minefield. During the ensuing evening hours, strong winds and currents caused herto drag her anchor. She slowly worked southward from her original position. The next morning, when Flamingo weighed anchor to get underway, she discovered that she had drifted into the minefield and had fouled one of the mines in her anchor cable. The mine was trailing just beneath the fantail of the ship and exploded beneath Flamingo′s stern. The underwater blast badly damaged the rudder, disabled the capstan and generator, and dished in the ship's stern plating in several places. (Minesweeper No. 17) lent assistance and towed Flamingo to Invergordon, Scotland, for drydocking and repairs on 17 July 1919. Flamingo was ready to return to the base at Kirkwall by early August 1919. She transported a cargo of steel and lumber to Black Hawk on her return voyage, arriving at Kirkwall on 13 August 1919. Two days later, the minesweeper towed her crippled sister ship (Minesweeper No. 27) to South Shields, England, for drydocking and repairs in the wake of Pelican′s mining in July. Later in August, Flamingo resumed her minesweeper duties with the detachment, working out of the Norwegian ports of Lervic, Stavanger, and Haugesund before returning to Kirkwall via Otters Wick, Orkney, on 7 September 1919. She subsequently participated in the final sweep of the mine barrage – the climactic sweep which detonated five mines, cut loose 47, and destroyed 50 – into late September 1919. Once the arduous and dangerous job was complete, Flamingo departed Kirkwall on 1 October 1919 and, after a voyage which took her via Plymouth and Devonport, England; Brest, France; Lisbon, Portugal; the Azores; and Bermuda, eventually arrived at Tompkinsville on 20 November 1919. The pause at Tompkinsville was a brief one, however, for Flamingo was underway five days later, on 25 November 1919, bound for the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She arrived on 28 November 1919 and soon commenced an overhaul. Assigned to the 1st Division, 2nd Mine Squadron, United States Atlantic Fleet, on 1 July 1920, Flamingo received the classification AM-32 on 17 July 1920, as the U.S. Navy adopted its modern system of alphanumeric hull numbers on that date. Flamingo operated with the 2nd Mine Squadron into the autumn of 1920, then was placed in reserve at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 18 November 1920.  USC&GS; Guide  USC&GS; Pioneer and USC&GS; Guide at Dutch Harbor, Territory of Alaska, in 1940. Flamingo remained inactive for almost a year a half before an executive order of 25 March 1922 authorized the Navy to transfer the vessel to the United States Department of Commerce for use by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and she accordingly was decommissioned on 5 May 1922. Turned over to the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 23 January 1923 for use as a survey vessel , the ship was renamed USC&GS; Guide, first Coast and Geodetic Survey ship of the name, on 1 March 1923. She and the survey ships USC&GS; Discoverer and USC&GS; Pioneer, also former Navy minesweepers, were known as the \\"Bird Boats\\" in the Coast and Geodetic Survey because all had been named after birds – Guide had been USS Flamingo, Discoverer had been , and Pioneer had been – while in Navy service. By January 1923, the Coast and Geodetic Survey had decided to install a Hayes sonic rangefinder – an early echo sounder – aboard Guide, which the Coast and Geodetic Survey planned to commission into its fleet later that year. It also decided to pursue the development of radio acoustic ranging, a new concept involving a method for determining a ship′s precise location at sea by detonating an explosive charge underwater near the ship, detecting the arrival of the underwater sound waves at hydrophones at remote locations, and radioing the time of arrival of the sound waves at the remote stations to the ship, allowing the ship′s crew to use triangulation to determine the ship′s position. Nicholas H. Heck (1882–1953), a United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer, took charge of that development process. Both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging required a precise understanding of the speed of sound through water.NOAA History: The Start of the Acoustic Work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Guide′s conversion to and fitting out as a survey ship on the United States East Coast was completed in 1923. After Heck oversaw tests at Coast and Geodetic Survey headquarters in Washington, D.C., that demonstrated that shipboard recording of the time of an explosion could be performed accurately enough for his radio acoustic ranging concept to work, Heck had Guide based at New London, Connecticut. Under his direction, Guide both tested her new echo sounder's ability to make accurate depth soundings and conducted radio acoustic ranging experiments in cooperation with the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. Despite many difficulties, testing of both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging wrapped up successfully in November 1923. In late November 1923, with Heck aboard, Guide departed New London, Connecticut, bound for her new home port, San Diego, California, via Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal, with her route planned to take her over a wide variety of ocean depths so that she could continue to test her echo sounder. Guide made history during the voyage, becoming the first Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to use echo sounding to measure and record the depth of the sea at points along her course; she also measured water temperatures and took water samples so that the Scripps Institution for Biological Research (now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography) at La Jolla, California, could measure salinity levels. She also compared echo sounder soundings with those made by lead lines, discovering that using a single speed of sound through water, as had been the previous practice by those conducting echo sounding experiments, yielded acoustic depth-finding results that did not match the depths found by lead lines. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 December 1923. Before she reached San Diego later in December 1923, she had accumulated much data beneficial to the study of the movement of sound waves through water and measuring their velocity under varying conditions of salinity, density, and temperature, information essential both to depth-finding and radio acoustic ranging. Upon arriving in California, Heck and Guide personnel in consultation with the Scripps Institution developed formulas that allowed accurate echo sounding of depths in all but the shallowest waters and installed hydrophones at La Jolla and Oceanside, California, to allow experimentation in the Pacific Ocean with radio acoustic ranging. Under Heck's direction, Guide then conducted experiments off the coast of California during the early months of 1924 that demonstrated that accurate echo sounding was possible using the new formulas. Experiments with radio acoustic ranging, despite initial difficulties, demonstrated that the method also was practical, although difficulty with getting some of the explosive charges to detonate hampered some of the experimental program. In April 1924, the Coast and Geodetic Survey concluded that both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging were fundamentally sound, with no foundational problems left to solve, and that all that remained necessary was continued development and refinement of both techniques during their operational use. Heck turned over continued development of echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging to Guide's commanding officer, Commander Robert Luce, and returned to his duties in Washington, D.C. Operating off Oregon in 1924, Guide became the first ship to employ radio acoustic ranging operationally. While off Oregon that year, she successfully employed the technique at a distance of 206 nautical miles (382 km) between the ranging explosion and the remote hydrophones detecting its sound and in the process achieved the first observed indication of the ocean sound layer that was later called the sound fixing and ranging (SOFAR) channel or deep sound channel (DSC).Theberge, Alfred E., \\"System Without Fixed Points: Development of the Radio-Acoustic Ranging Navigation Technique (Part 1),\\" hydro-international.com, December 2, 2009.hydro-international.com The Discovery of Long-Distance Sound Transmission in the Ocean Based at San Diego and conducting hydrographic surveys off the U.S. West Coast, Guide performed Coast and Geodetic Survey duties for over 17 years. In company with Pioneer, she conducted many early bathymetric surveys on the U.S. West Coast. On more than one occasion, Guide assisted mariners in distress. On 3 June 1927, she came to the assistance of the lumber schooner City of Nome, which was on fire at Aberdeen, Washington; Guide stood by City of Nome until 5 June 1927, pumped water into the schooner, and helped retard the fire sufficiently to allow salvage of City of Nomes cargo. On 4 February 1933, she rendered assistance to the fishing boat Giuseppina, which had broken down with engine trouble in Monterey Bay, California. As tensions mounted in Europe and East Asia in the late 1930s, the U.S. Navy expanded to meet the emergency, especially after World War II began in Europe following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. The Navy needed auxiliary vessels of various types, and cast a wide net in looking for them. One of the ships identified for transfer to the Navy was Guide, and, on 27 June 1941, she was transferred from the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the Navy. Commemoration An underwater geographic feature of the Pacific Ocean, Guide Seamount off the coast of California, is named for Guide.  USS Viking  On 25 July 1941, work to convert the vessel into a rescue and salvage ship began at the San Diego Marine Construction Company in San Diego. During the reconfiguration, the Navy renamed the ship USS Viking, third U.S. Navy ship of the name, on 5 August 1941 and classified her as ARS-1. While the alterations were still in progress, Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 7 December 1941, plunging the United States into World War II. Placed in service on 3 January 1942, Viking was pronounced ready for duty on 12 February 1942. Manned by a civilian crew and operated from San Diego by the Merritt, Chapman, and Scott salvage firm – a civilian company working under a contract let by the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships – Viking was assigned to the 11th Naval District. Between 3 and 6 July 1942, Viking assisted two U.S. Navy local patrol craft, YP-267 and YP-269, which had run aground off San Diego, towing them both back to port for repairs. According to her movement reports, Viking appears to have spent an uneventful autumn and winter at her home port. Viking shifted to San Francisco, California, briefly in January 1943, en route Guadalupe in Baja California, Mexico, to perform emergency salvage operations under the aegis of the Commander, Western Sea Frontier. Returning to San Diego in February 1943, Viking operated there into 1944. On 27 October 1944, Viking steamed to San Pedro, California, for a refit. She returned to San Diego later in November 1944. On 31 December 1944, Viking departed San Diego in company with the fleet ocean tug bound for Clipperton Island. There, the two vessels joined the rescue and salvage ship in unsuccessful attempts to refloat the grounded tank landing ship . During the salvage operation, Viking suffered damage from heavy seas and put into San Diego for repairs soon thereafter. Viking subsequently operated out of San Diego and San Pedro through the end of World War II in mid-August 1945. She performed tug and tow services for ships ranging in size from destroyers to tank landing ships into the 1950s. In December 1949, she aided the grounded steamer off the south point of California′s Santa Rosa Island. Eventually, Viking's area of operations embraced Long Beach and Port Hueneme, California, as well as the San Diego area. Relieved by the rescue and salvage ship as salvage vessel for the 11th Naval District, Viking was returned to Navy custody by the Merritt, Chapman, and Scott salvage firm. On 17 March 1953, she was authorized for disposal, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 19 April 1953. She lay at the Naval Supply Depot at San Pedro until sold on 22 July 1953 to Nathan Cohen and Son, Inc., of Los Angeles, California. She was scrapped soon thereafter.

(2006). American Sideshow: An Encyclopedia of History's Most Wondrous and Curiously Strange Performers. New York: Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin. p. 210. . Google books, retrieved 2013-01-16. and legally Schlitze Surtees, was an American sideshow performer. He also appeared in a few films, and is best known for his role in the 1932 movie Freaks. His lifelong career on the outdoor entertainment circuit as a major sideshow attraction with Barnum & Bailey, among others, made him a popular cultural icon. Biography Schlitzie's true birth date, name, location and parents are unknown; the information on his death certificate and gravesite indicate that he was born on September 10, 1901, in The Bronx, New York, though some sources have claimed that he was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Hornberger, F. (2005). Carny Folk: The World's Weirdest Sideshow Acts. New York: Citadel Press. p. 129. . Claims that he was born in Yucatán, Mexico, are mistaken reflections of Schlitzie's occasional fanciful billing as \\"Maggie, last of the Aztec Children\\". Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career. Schlitzie was born with microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that left him with an unusually small brain and skull, a small stature (he stood about four feet tall [122 cm]), myopia, and severe intellectual disability. It is possible that these features were caused by Seckel syndrome. It was said Schlitzie had the cognition of a three-year- old: he was unable to care fully for himself and could speak only in monosyllabic words and form a few simple phrases. However, he was able to perform simple tasks, and it is believed that he could understand most of what was said to him, as he had a very quick reaction time and the ability to mimic. Those who knew Schlitzie described him as an affectionate, exuberant, sociable person who loved dancing, singing, and being the center of attention, performing for anyone he could stop and talk with. Career On the sideshow circuit, microcephalic people were usually promoted as \\"pinheads\\" or \\"missing links\\", and Schlitzie was billed under such titles as \\"The Last of the Aztecs\\", \\"The Monkey Girl\\", and . In some sideshows, he was paired with another microcephalic performer. Schlitzie was often dressed in a muumuu and presented as either female or androgynous to add to the mystique of his unusual appearance. Those who knew him alternately used masculine and feminine pronouns. His urinary incontinence, which obliged him to wear diapers, made dresses practical for his care needs, although it is possible that the incontinence did not develop until later in life and was simply a side-effect of age. The sideshow circuit was a tremendous success for Schlitzie; throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was employed by many upscale circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, Tom Mix Circus, Crafts 20 Big Shows and Foley & Burke Carnival. In 1928, Schlitzie made his film debut in The Sideshow, a drama set in a circus, which featured a variety of actual sideshow performers. Schlitzie in 1938, billed as The Last of the Aztecs Freaks and later work Schlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Like The Sideshow, Freaks takes place at a carnival and features a number of genuine sideshow performers, including conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, \\"The Living Torso\\" Prince Randian, and dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. Two other \\"pinheads\\" also appear in the film. When referring to Schlitzie, other actors use feminine pronouns. When Freaks premiered in 1932, cinema audiences were scandalized by the appearance of sideshow performers. The United Kingdom banned the film for thirty years. The film was a financial failure, and Browning, although he went on to make several more films for MGM, retired in 1940. Schlitzie appeared in bit roles in various movies and is credited with a role in the 1934 exploitation film Tomorrow's Children as a mentally defective criminal who undergoes forced sterilization. While Schlitzie was performing with the Tom Mix Circus in 1935, George Surtees, a chimpanzee trainer with a trained-chimpanzee act in the show, adopted him, becoming his legal guardian. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \\"Princess Bibi\\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie. Hospitalization Under George Surtees' care, Schlitzie continued performing the sideshow circuit; after Surtees' death in 1965, his daughter, who was not in show business, committed Schlitzie to a Los Angeles county hospital. Schlitzie remained hospitalized for some time until he was recognized by sword swallower Bill \\"Frenchy\\" Unks, who happened to be working at the hospital during the off- season. According to Unks, Schlitzie seemed to miss the carnival badly, and being away from the public eye had made him very depressed. Hospital authorities determined that the best care for Schlitzie would be to make him a ward of Unks' employer, showman Sam Alexander, and return him to the sideshow, where he remained until 1968. Final years In his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. He liked going to MacArthur Park at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, where he would visit the lake with his guardian, feeding the pigeons and ducks and performing for passersby. On September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \\"Shlitze Surtees\\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights. Cultural legacy In the 1960s, Freaks was rediscovered and enjoyed a long run as one of the first midnight movies, becoming a cult classic, and in 1994 it was selected by the National Film Registry as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film became the public's major exposure to Schlitzie, who remains one of the more memorable characters in the film. Schlitzie's iconic image has lent itself to many products, including masks, hats, shirts, models, clocks, snow globes, and dolls. Additionally, Schlitzie has been cited as an inspiration for Bill Griffith's comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, and the circus freak Bertram in Red Dead Redemption 2. Griffith has recently released Nobody's Fool, a graphic novel biography of Schlitzie. The biographic account of Schlitzie will be featured in a new documentary, titled Schlitzie: One of Us, currently in production and directed by Steve Belgard.

SCN has over 430 spaces (sub-groups) dedicated to SAP products, topics, technologies, industries, programming languages (such as ABAP) and more. Almost all spaces contain related discussion threads (forums), blogs, documents, elearning, and polls. There are also several spaces in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian.  History  The SAP Community Network (SCN) was created in 2003 as the SAP Developer Network. In 2006, a sub-community for business process experts was created for users that defined their role as business analysts or consultants. After the acquisition of BusinessObjects, the BusinessObjects Diamond community was integrated into SCN at first as the BusinessObjects community and later as the Business Analytics Community. University Alliances Community was launched in 2009 to support collaboration among professors, students, customers and partners worldwide. Around 2008, the term \\"SAP Developer Network\\" no longer adequately described the scope of the community so it was rename to SAP Community Network. SCN is still colloquially referred to as \\"SDN.\\" In March 2012, the SAP Community Network was migrated to a Jive based platform hosted on a new sub-domain: scn.sap.com. The new platform is more robust than the former and finally brings all discussions (forums), blogs and documents into a single space for easier access and use. After the migration, the sub-communities for SDN, BPX and BOC/BA continue to exist in newsletter format. On April 28, 2013, the SAP Community Network was enhanced with the Jive Gamification Module (JGM). Gamification, the use of game mechanics to make tasks more fun, is used to encourage community engagement on SCN. Included in the implementation are missions (activities that are recorded by the system, such as likes, ratings, comments), badges for completed missions, badges for lifetime points (levels), and badges for specific roles. In the first week after the launch of JGM, community actions increased by 1034% and active members (members with >0 points) increased by 516%.

The jewels belonged to the Nizams. After the annexation of their kingdom by Union of India, the Nizam and his heirs were barred by the Indian government from taking the collection, claiming that it was a national treasure. Once the Nizams' state regalia, the ornaments date from the early 18th century to the early 20th century. Crafted in gold and silver and embellished with enameling, the jewels are set with Colombian emeralds, 99% diamonds from the Kollur Diamond Mine in Guntur district and diamond mine in Krishna district (Andhra Rayalaseema Diamond mines group, Burmese rubies and spinels, and pearls from Basra and the Gulf of Mannar. There are 173 jewels, which includes emeralds weighing nearly , and pearls exceeding 40,000 chows. The collection includes gemstones, turban ornaments, necklaces and pendants, belts and buckles, earrings, armbands, bangles and bracelets, anklets, cufflinks and buttons, watch chains, and rings, toe rings, and nose rings. Among them is the seven-stringed Basrah pearl necklace, known as Satlada, which has 465 pearls embedded in it. One of the prized possessions in the collection is the Jacob Diamond, the fifth largest diamond in the world weighing 184.75 carats, which was found by the last Nizam, Osman Ali Khan, in the toe of his father’s shoe at Chowmahalla Palace and he himself used it as a paper weight for a long time. History of the jewels In 1995, the Indian government bought the jewels for ₹218 crore (about US$70 million), many years after the death of Last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1967. In reality, the Nizam's trustees agreed to sell the famous collection to India in lieu of tax.

He possesses psychic abilities that allow him to see moments of the future and past, usually triggered by touching objects or a person related to that future. He is portrayed by Christopher Walken in the film adaptation and Anthony Michael Hall in the USA Network television series. Paste Magazine has ranked Johnny Smith the sixth out of eight creepiest Christopher Walken performances. In the novel, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers to the part of Johnny Smith's brain that is damaged beyond repair, causing dormant parts to awaken in order to compensate, leading to psychic abilities; when information in his visions is obstructed, Johnny says it exists in the dead zone. In the movie adaptation starring Walken, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers to blind spots that only appear in precognitive visions, representing that the future is capable of being altered. In the TV series starring Hall, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers not to his brain damage but instead to the previously dormant part of Johnny's brain that awakens and activates his psychic abilities. Novel In 1953, Johnny Smith is six years old when he suffers a head injury and immediately has a psychic vision of the near future, an event he barely even remembers as an adult. As an adult in 1971, Johnny Smith is an English teacher living in Cleaves Mills, nearby the fictional town of Castle Rock in Maine. After a date with his girlfriend Sarah at a county fair, he is involved in a car crash. His injuries leave him in a coma for four and a half years. Desperate for hope, his mother Vera becomes intensely religious, believing prayer will bring her son back. On May 17, 1975, Johnny regains consciousness. Medical testing reveals a minor part of his brain suffered permanent damage. As if to compensate for the damage, a long-dormant part of his brain has become active. When Johnny touches certain people or objects, he now sometimes experiences psychic visions relating to them, revealing either hidden truths about their past, dangers in their future, or situations happening in the present that are connected to them. His visions have limitations and parts of them are often clouded. Johnny refers to this obstructed information as existing in the damaged part of his brain, \\"the dead zone.\\" Initially hoping to use his powers to help others, such as warning a woman that her kitchen is on fire, Johnny eventually denies their existence and is relieved when a tabloid reporter he refused to cooperate with decides to label him a fraud. Johnny then reluctantly uses his power again when Sheriff George Bannerman seeks assistance in tracking the Castle Rock Strangler, a serial killer. After finding the killer, Johnny is again a subject of interest to news media. He is unable to return to his old teaching job on the grounds that he is now \\"too controversial\\" to be an educator. He goes into semi-retirement, taking a job as a private tutor. Sometime later, he meets rising politician Greg Stillson. As a result, Johnny foresees a nuclear apocalypse that Stillson will directly cause if he goes on to become President. Reluctant to resort to murder, Johnny's hand is forced when he discovers he has developed a terminal tumor. With no hope of gathering evidence to expose Stillson's threat in the time left to him, Johnny instead attempts to shoot him at a public event. Johnny fails and is fatally wounded by Stillson's security detail, but not before the politician is photographed attempting to use a nearby child as a human shield. Grabbing Stillson's leg, Johnny dies knowing that he has succeeded in preventing Stillson from ever becoming President. The 1983 movie adaptation of The Dead Zone is mainly faithful to the novel but does include some changes. In the movie, Johnny explains that visions of the future include a \\"blank spot\\" or \\"dead zone\\" and his doctor concludes this represents that the future is not set and can be altered. Television series In the television series The Dead Zone, Johnny is introduced in the pilot episode, \\"Wheel of Fortune (Part 1)\\". Born John Robert Smith in 1967, this version of Johnny is a high school science teacher in Cleaves Mills High near Bangor and engaged to be married to Sarah Anne Bracknell, whom he has known since childhood. A horrific car crash on June 6, 1995 puts Johnny into a coma for six-years. Told that Johnny will never wake up, his mother Vera loses faith in God and later dies. Sarah marries local Penobscot County Sheriff Walter T. Bannerman. The two are raising Johnny and Sarah's son JJ (the boy is unaware of his true father's identity). On September 1, 2001, rising politician Greg Stillson is sworn in as a state representative. At the moment Stillson takes his oath, Johnny awakens from his coma, saying, \\"Something's wrong.\\" Johnny quickly discovers he now has psychic visions that can be triggered by physical contact. His doctor tells him that a dormant portion of his brain, an area one might normally consider a \\"dead zone\\" of the brain, now seems to be active and may be responsible for his powers. Johnny and Sarah reunite and he learns he has a son. Sarah wants JJ to come to know and love Johnny, hoping to eventually explain their connection to the child. Sarah is conflicted about her feelings for Johnny, while Johnny is torn between hoping Sarah will leave her husband and thinking he should move on with his life. His physical therapist Bruce Lewis also becomes his confidant and best friend as he tries to resume a normal life in Bangor. Driven to action by visions of death and crime, Johnny repeatedly uses his power to aid Sheriff Bannerman, and the two develop a grudging respect for each other. On many of his adventures, Johnny is aided by Bruce Lewis, who helps ground him and offers emotional support. Unlike his novel and movie counterparts, Johnny is able to increasingly accept his powers over time and become more comfortable with their use, though he still dislikes public attention and resents strangers believing he can solve all their problems. In the first season episode \\"Shaman,\\" Johnny has a vision of a Native American shaman who had similar abilities centuries before and realizes he is not the first one to have this gift. By holding onto the shaman's personal item, Johnny is able to send messages into the past during moments the shaman also held the object. Johnny realizes he can preserve or alter the past by communicating with and influencing another \\"dead zone\\" psychic.The Dead Zone season 1 - \\"Shaman\\" In the season two episode \\"The Hunt\\", Johnny learns the U.S. government employs other psychics to help with counter-terrorist operations; he aids them for a short time. During the first two seasons of the show, Johnny has a casual relationship with local journalist Dana Bright. In season three, he has a more serious relationship with therapist and psychiatrist Rebecca Caldwell, though this ends at the beginning of season four. In the fourth-season episode \\"Double Vision\\", Johnny meets another psychic named Alex Sinclair who has experienced metaphorical visions since childhood. The two feel a romantic connection but fear their combined psychic abilities will only too much stress for a relationship. They meet again on different adventures. During the first season, Johny is haunted by visions of a dark tower surrounded by flames. After encountering politician Greg Stillson in the season 1 finale, his vision becomes clearer and he realizes that the dark tower he sees is actually an ash-covered version of the Washington Monument that exists in a possible future where Still has caused an apocalypse on Earth. Johnny's quest to stop \\"armageddon\\" becomes the ongoing subplot of the series during his other adventures, and he later shares his vision of the future and his fear of Stillson with Bruce. In the season two finale \\"Vision,\\" Johnny learns he can sometimes communicate with Christopher Wey, a man who will become a \\"dead zone\\" psychic in the future when he wakes up from a coma after the apocalypse has happened. As with the shaman, Wey communicates with Johnny in the \\"past\\" by touching a personal object, the head of Johnny's cane. Eventually, Wey works alongside future versions of Johnny and JJ who are hoping to change their reality by sending messages into the past. In the season two episode \\"Zion\\", Johnny's power temporarily activates Bruce's dead zone. Rather than a vision of the past or future, Bruce experiences a timeline where he never left his home and so never met Johnny. This alternate timeline resembles the canon of the novel and movie, showing Johnny as a suspicious and unsocial loner who attempts to publicly assassinate Stillson. Bruce is shocked by Johnny's attitude and behavior in this version of events, saying, \\"This is the you that would have been had I not been there for you.\\" Before the vision ends, Bruce sees Johnny fail to kill Stillson and in turn be gunned down by the man's security detail. Bruce then has a vision of his father telling him that his destiny is to protect Johnny Smith. After six seasons, The Dead Zone was canceled without resolving whether or not Johnny would prevent the apocalypse. In the final episode, Johnny learns his father had psychic abilities. The same episode depicts JJ suffering a minor head injury and then experiencing a vision of the apocalypse when Greg Stillson touches him (a vision Johnny experiences simultaneously elsewhere). JJ tells his parents only that he saw something \\"terrible\\" when he touched Stillson, and the last scene of the episode shows Johnny preparing to discuss it further.

English Art song in the 17th Century Henry Purcell The composition of polyphonic music was at its peak in the late 16th century. By that time, however, the lute started to gain popularity, and was very common among educated people by 1600. The Italians were trying to recapture a simpler vocal style, to mimic Greek models. Giulio Caccini and the Florentine Camerata developed the monody, for solo voice with lute accompaniment, around 1600. Caccini traveled around Europe, other countries begin developing their own solo songs with lute, especially the English composers. John Dowland (1563–1626) and Thomas Campion (1567–1620) emerged as the best-known and most respected of the composers of lute song. Later in the 17th century, Henry Purcell (1659–95) composed many solo songs for his semi-operas, and his songs are also generally considered among the best early English Art songs.See \\"British Song\\" in Carol Kimball, Song: A Guide to Art Song Style and Literature, p. 351 Other English Art song composers in the 17th century * William Byrd (1543–1623), composed \\"consort songs\\" with viol consort accompaniment, 1588 collection of Psalms, Sonnets, and Songs * Thomas Morley (1557–1603), his songs may have been used in Shakespeare's plays, well-known song \\"It was a Lover and his Lass\\" from his First Book of Ayres, 1607 * Michael Cavendish (c.1565-1628), published one volume of madrigals and lute songs in 1598 * Francis Pilkington (1582–1638), lute song composer * Robert Jones (fl. 1597-1615); 5 books of ayres, 1600–1610 * Tobias Hume (d. 1648), serious and comic songs * Philip Rosseter (c.1567-1623), prolific song composer and friend of Campion, a few of his lute songs are still performed * Henry Lawes (1595–1662); prolific song composer, set texts by court poets (Herring, Suckling, and Carew) for his vocal works English Art song in the 18th Century As Italian opera composition developed in the later 17th century, recitative and aria began to split apart as separate parts of solo vocal music. Four types of vocal music began to blossom in the 18th century: church music, early oratorio (esp. with Carissimi in Italy), opera, and the secular (or \\"chamber\\") cantata. In the early 18th century, George Frideric Handel (1685–1759) made Italian opera very popular in London, but The Beggar's Opera in 1729, a parody of Handel's Italian operas, created a new fad for English popular opera, and Italian opera in London faded by 1740. Thus, the two important types of English solo vocal music in the mid 18th century are oratorios by Handel, and \\"pastiche operas\\" or \\"ballad operas\\" from Arne, Boyce and other English composers. The publication of solo vocal music (songs often called \\"canzonets\\" or canzonettas\\") with English texts at the end of the 18th century helped to establish the art song genre in subsequent years. George Frideric Handel English Art song composers in the 18th century * William Croft (c.1678-1727), sacred songs * Henry Carey (c.1687-1743), writer and prolific song composer * Carl Friedrich Abel (1723–87), German born but moved to London, composed symphonies, quartets, and a few vocal pieces * Thomas Linley the elder (1733–95), composed English ballads and theater music * Johann Christian Bach (1735–82), J.S. Bach's youngest son, called \\"the London Bach,\\" was a friend to the young Mozart, composed Italian operas in London like Handel 50 years earlier * William Jackson (1730–1803), lived in western England, his Op. 9 2-part canzonets were published in 1770 * Samuel Arnold (1740–1802), primarily a theater composer, but published a book of solo songs, Op. 13, in 1778 * Johann Peter Salomon (1745–1815), German-born violinist, composer and impresario, published two books of canzonets, in 1805 and 1807, brought Joseph Haydn to London * James Hook (1746–1827), composed keyboard works and songs, as well as one oratorio * Sir John Andrew Stevenson (1761-1833), a prolific Irish composer, known for his work with Thomas Moore * Stephen Storace (1762–96), half Italian, knew Mozart, composed for the theater * George Frederick Pinto (1785–1806), a child prodigy, he composed piano works and songs, his canzonets were published in 1804 English Art song in the 19th Century London was the largest city in Europe by 1800; many non-English composers traveled there, especially from Germany and Italy. English theater works (\\"ballad operas\\") continued to be popular into the 19th century. The harpsichord, fortepiano, harp, and guitar were all popular instruments at the time; all were used to accompany voices and as solo instruments; song composition began to flourish as home music making with these instrument increased. In the 19th century almost everyone sang, in choral societies, at church services, and at home (in the 'drawing room'). Popular songs, called ballads, became the standard for vocal music publishing later in the 19th century, creating a \\"low point\\" in British music composition. Famous singers performed these ballads in concerts, paid for by music publishers, so that the songs would gain popularity and sell copies. In contrast, serious British composers late in the 19th century look towards Germany for inspiration and support. Franz Joseph Haydn Primary English Art song composers in the early 19th century * William Shield (1748–1829), made famous the song \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" * Sir Henry Bishop (1786–1855), composed the famous song \\"Home Sweet Home\\" * Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), late in his life he found a new fame in London, esp. in symphony and oratorio; published 2 sets of English Canzonets in 1794 and 1795 written by Anne Hunter Primary English Art song composers in the mid- to late 19th century * Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900), composed a few art songs, \\"The Lost Chord\\" was an extremely popular ballad in its day * Charles Hubert Parry (1848–1918), his twelve sets of songs, settings of Shakespeare and other important English poets, called \\"English Lyrics\\" are an important contribution to the song genre; influenced by German Lieder * Edward Elgar (1857–1934), known for his important orchestral and choral works, but he wrote a few songs as well; his 1899 song cycle Sea Pictures for voice and orchestra set a high standard for English song * Frederick Delius (1862–1934) The opening measures of Arthur Somervell's \\"Come Into the Garden, Maud\\" Other English Art song composers in the mid- to late 19th century * Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924), Irish born, his many songs show a German influence * Maude Valérie White (1855–1937), perhaps the first important female composer in England, she composed chiefly songs * Dame Ethel Smyth (1858–1944), a few of her songs are published * Liza Lehmann (1862–1918), was German born, but settled in England, she is best known for her cycle \\"In a Persian Garden\\" for four voices and piano * Edward German (1862–1936), wrote operettas like Gilbert & Sullivan, a few of his songs are still in the repertoire from publication in anthologies * Arthur Somervell (1863–1937), used some folksong elements in his compositions, he is best known for his \\"Maud\\" and \\"A Shropshire Lad\\" cycles * Charles Wood (1866–1926), Irish-born composer and church musician, wrote many songs including a setting of Walt Whitman's \\"Ethiopia Saluting the Colours\\"\\"Ethiopia Saluting the Colors\\" in the original poem, but Wood used the British spelling for his song setting. * Granville Bantock (1868–1946), published six volumes of \\"Songs of the East\\" on verses of Asian poets, mostly forgotten today * Henry Walford Davies (1869–1941), most of his songs are rarely heard today English Art song in the 20th Century The great success of European Romantic composers encouraged a \\"Renaissance\\" of English music, especially vocal music. Interest in British folk music was expanded through the work of Cecil Sharp, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others; it gradually becomes incorporated into British \\"classical\\" music. The highest point of the English musical \\"Renaissance\\" began around 1900, and many great art songs were composed in England before the First World War. A second great era for song composition occurred between the wars, in the years 1920-1938.See \\"British Song\\" in Carol Kimball, Song: A Guide to Art Song Style and Literature, p. 352 Benjamin Britten Primary English Art song composers in the 20th century * Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) * Roger Quilter (1877–1953) * Frank Bridge (1879–1941) * John Ireland (1879–1962) * Arnold Bax (1883–1953) * George Butterworth (1885–1916) * Ivor Gurney (1890–1937) * Herbert Howells (1892–1983) * Peter Warlock (1894–1930) * Michael Head (1900–1976) * Eric Thiman (1900–1975) * Gerald Finzi (1901–56) * Benjamin Britten (1913–1976) * William Walton (1902–83) Other English Art song composers in the 20th century * Cyril Rootham (1875–1938), teacher to Cecil Armstrong Gibbs and Arthur Bliss; composed over 60 songs, also sacred pieces, chamber music, choral and orchestral works * Ernest Farrar (1885–1918), killed in World War I; Gerald Finzi's teacher, composed 15 songs * Bernard van Dieren (1887–1936), his music moved towards 20th century serialism; composed about 35 songs in English * William Denis Browne (1888–11915), schoolteacher, music critic, and composer; killed in World War I, completed 11 songs * Cecil Armstrong Gibbs (1889–1960); composed about 160 songs, many settings of texts by his friend Walter de la Mare * Arthur Bliss (1891–1975), composed about 60 songs, much great orchestral and chamber music * Benjamin Burrows (1891–1966), teacher, composer, and music typographer; composed over 100 songs, 93 for his soprano friend Jane Vowles; settings of Housman, Rossetti, Herrick, de la Mare, Afro- American Spirituals, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson * Alec Rowley (1892–1958), composer, pianist, and organist * Charles Wilfred Orr (1893–1976); 35 songs, mostly settings of Housman * Arthur Benjamin (1893–1960), raised in Australia but moved to London * Eugene Goossens (1893–1962), a conductor and composer, wrote a few art songs * Ernest John Moeran (1894–1950), studied with John Ireland, Irish influences are in his songs * Patrick Hadley (1899–1973), composed 10 songs and chamber vocal works * Alan Bush (1900–95), composed 30 art songs * Edmund Rubbra (1901–1986), composed both art songs and vocal works with orchestra * Victor Hely- Hutchinson (1901–47), composed quite a few songs, but most are rarely performed * Lennox Berkeley (1903–1989), composed many songs * Constant Lambert (1905–1951), composed only a few art songs * William Alwyn (1905–85), composed several song cycles in the 1970s * Alan Rawsthorne (1905–1971), composed 11 published songs * Michael Tippett (1905–1998), well known as an opera composer, but only wrote a few songs and vocal works with orchestra * John Raynor (1909–1970) more than 680 works, mostly songs for soprano or tenor; also sacred pieces, including carols and a Mass setting; 19 of his works have been published. * John Sykes (1909–1962), wrote about 30 songs, mid-century * Mervyn Horder (1910–1997), composed about 90 songs, neoromantic, great variety of texts * Robert Still (1910–1971), composed about 20 songs, setting texts by a variety of famous poets * Geoffrey Bush (1920–1998), song settings from Shakespeare to contemporary poetry * Madeleine Dring (1923–1977), over 60 songs, eclectic music style English Art song in the 21st Century Art song composition continues to thrive today, and many English composers are using the internet to show their pieces to the world.

The school is co-educational and accepts children aged 11–16. Corpus Christi has traditionally performed well, with consistently good and above- average performance shown during inspections.  History  Corpus Christi was founded in 1987, having originally been called Lady Mary High School. The school moved into its new building shortly after this restructuring. Lady Mary High School originally included its own Sixth Form college. However, the school does not have a sixth form so pupils go to St. David's Catholic College for further education and for some vocational courses at GCSE.  Structure   Size  In 2015, there were 1042 students enrolled at the school, a slight increase on previous years. Most students come from 6 feeder schools in the wider Cardiff area, and the school can accept up to 215 students for each year group. The school is regularly oversubscribed, with places difficult to get for new Year 7 students, particularly for students not from one of the feeder schools.

The song is a jazz and pop standard. Background The song was introduced by Ted Lewis in the Broadway revue The Passing Show of 1923. The song was duly published in 1924 by Mills Music in New York by Jack Mills. It was first recorded on February 22, 1924 by Isham Jones and his Orchestra and released on Brunswick Records as a 78 single.Nobody's Sweetheart Now. Second Hand Songs. Joel Whitburn assessed the early popular recordings of the song as being by Isham Jones (1924); Red Nichols (1928); Paul Whiteman (1930); Cab Calloway (1931); and by The Mills Brothers (1931). The song was used as the theme for the Joan Davis Time program on old-time radio.

It is formed by an invagination of the hyaloid membrane, which encloses the vitreous body. In the fetus, the hyaloid canal contains a prolongation of the central artery of the retina, the hyaloid artery, which supplies blood to the developing lens. Once the lens is fully developed the hyaloid artery retracts and the hyaloid canal contains lymph. The hyaloid canal appears to have no function in the adult eye, though its remnant structure can be seen. Contrary to initial belief, the hyaloid canal does not facilitate changes in the volume of the lens. The lens volume changes by less than 1% over its range of accommodation. Furthermore, lymph, being liquid, is incompressible, so even if the volume of the lens did change, the hyaloid canal could not compensate for it.

The base operating used by Sony for the PlayStation 3 is a fork of both FreeBSD and NetBSD called CellOS. The process of updating is almost identical to that of the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4. The software may be updated by downloading the update directly on the PlayStation 3, downloading it from the user's local Official PlayStation website to a PC and using a USB storage device to transfer it to the PlayStation 3, or installing the update from game discs containing update data. The initial slim PS3s SKU shipped with a unique firmware with new features, also seen in software 3.00. Technology System The native operating system of the PlayStation 3 is CellOS, which is believed to be a fork of FreeBSD; TCP/IP stack fingerprinting identifies a PlayStation 3 as running FreeBSD, and the PlayStation 3 is known to contain code from FreeBSD and NetBSD. The 3D computer graphics API software used in the PlayStation 3 is LibGCM and PSGL, based on OpenGL ES and Nvidia's Cg. LibGCM is a low level API, and PSGL is a higher level API, but most developers preferred to use libGCM due to higher levels of performance. This is similar to the later PlayStation 4 console which also has two APIs, the low level GNM and the higher level GNMX. Unlike the Software Development Kit (SDK) for mobile apps, Sony's PlayStation 3 SDK is only available to registered game development companies and contains software tools and an integrated hardware component. Due to the fact that it requires a licensing agreement with Sony (which is considered expensive), a number of open source and homebrew PS3 SDKs are available in addition to a number of leaked PS3 SDKs. Graphical shell The PlayStation 3 uses the XrossMediaBar (XMB) as its graphical user interface, which is also used in the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console, a variety of Sony BRAVIA HDTVs, Blu-ray disc players and many more Sony products. XMB displays icons horizontally across the screen that be seen as categories. Users can navigate through them using the left and right buttons of the D-pad, which move the icons forward or back across the screen, highlighting just one at a time, as opposed to using any kind of pointer to select an option. When one category is selected, there are usually more specific options then available to select that are spread vertically above and below the selected icon. Users may navigate among these options by using the up and down buttons of the D-pad. The basic features offered by XMB implementations varies based on device and software version. Apart from those appearing in the PSP console such as category icons for Photos, Music and Games, the PS3 added Users, TV and Friends to the XMB. Also, XMB offers a degree of multitasking. In-game XMB features were added to the PS3 properly with firmware version 2.41 after causing early implementation problems. While XMB proved to be a successful user interface for Sony products such as PSP and PS3, the next generation Sony video game consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita no longer use this user interface. Cooperation with handheld consoles The PlayStation 3 supports Remote Play with Sony's handheld game consoles, the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation Vita. However, unlike Remote Play between the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita, the problem with PS3 was that it only supported a \\"select\\" few titles and results were often laggy. However, it is clear that Remote Play with the PS3 was the testing bed for its much better integration with the PS4. Also, for users having both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita, it is possible to share media files videos, music and images between them by transferring multimedia files directly from the PlayStation 3 to the PlayStation Vita, or vice versa. Furthermore, they can use a service called cross-buy which allows them to buy certain games that support this feature one time, and play them in both Sony platforms. Not only that, but in the case of most such games, their saved games actually transfer back and forth between devices, allowing players to pick up from the moment they left off. There is also a feature called cross-play (or cross-platform play) covering any PlayStation Vita software title that can interact with a PlayStation 3 software title. Different software titles use Cross-Play in different ways. For example, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a title supporting the Cross-Play feature, and the PS3 version of the game can be controlled using the PS Vita system. In addition, some PS3 games can be played on the PS Vita using the PlayStation Now streaming service. Non-game features Similar to many other consoles, the PlayStation 3 is capable of photo, audio, and video playback in a variety of formats. It also includes various photo slideshow options and several music visualizations. Furthermore, the PlayStation 3 is able to play Blu-ray Disc and DVD movies as well as audio CDs out of the box, and also capable of adopting streaming media services such as Netflix. For a web browser, the PS3 uses the NetFront browser, although unlike its successor PS4 which uses the same modern Webkit core as Safari from Apple, the PS3 web browser receives a low score in HTML5 compliance testing. However, unlike the PS4, the PS3 is able to play Adobe Flash, including full-screen flash. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 system software also provided a feature called OtherOS that was available on the PS3 systems prior to the slimmer models launched in September 2009. This feature enabled users to install an operating system such as Linux, but due to security concerns, Sony later removed this functionality through the 3.21 system software update. According to Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE), disabling this feature will help ensure that PS3 owners will continue to have access to the broad range of gaming and entertainment content from SCE and its content partners on a more secure system. Sony was successfully sued in a class action over the removal of this feature. The settlement was approved in September 2016. Sony agreed to pay up to $55 to as many as 10 million PS3 owners but denied wrongdoing. Furthermore, the PlayStation 3 provides printing support. It can for example print images and web pages when a supported printer is connected via a USB cable or a local network. However, only a selection of printers from Canon, Epson, and Hewlett- Packard are compatible with the PS3. Backward compatibility All PlayStation 3 consoles are able to play original PlayStation games (PSone discs and downloadable classics). However, not all PlayStation 3 models are backwards compatible with the PlayStation 2 games. In summary, early PS3 consoles such as the 60GB and 20GB launch PS3 consoles were backwards compatible with PS2 games because they had PS2 chips in them. Some later models, most notably the 80GB Metal Gear Solid PS3 consoles are also backwards compatible, through partial software emulation in this case since they no longer had the PS2 CPU in them, although they do have the PS2 GPU in them, allowing for reduced backward compatibility through hardware-assisted software emulation. All other later models, such as the PS3 Slim are not PS2 backwards compatible, though users can still enjoy PS3 and PSone games on them. According to Sony, when they removed backwards compatibility from the PS3 they had already been at a point where they were three years into its lifecycle; by that time the vast majority of consumers that were purchasing the PS3 cite PS3 games as a primary reason, meaning that the PS2 compatibility was no longer necessary. Nevertheless, PS2 Classics which are playable on the PS3 have officially been introduced to the PlayStation Network for purchase afterwards,THE PS2 CLASSICS BUYER'S GUIDE FOR PSN although they are only a selection of PS2 games republished in digital format, and unlike PS3 games, they lack Trophy support.ARE TROPHIES COMING FOR PSONE AND PS2 CLASSICS? Later when the PlayStation 4 console was released, it was not backward compatible with either PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 2 games, although limited PS2 backward compatibility was later introduced, and PS4 owners might play a selected group of PS3 games by streaming them over the Internet using the PlayStation Now cloud-based gaming service. LV0 keys The PlayStation 3 LV0 keys are a set of cryptographic keys which form the core of the PlayStation 3's security system. According to a news story on Polygon: With the LV0 keys users are able to circumvent restrictions placed by Sony, more commonly known as jailbreaking. The LV0 keys were released online by a group calling themselves \\"The Three Musketeers\\", granting users access to some of the most sensitive parts of the PlayStation 3. With access to these areas, users can decrypt security updates and work around the authorized PlayStation firmware. This allows PlayStation 3 firmware updates to be modified on a computer so that they can be run on a modified console. The Three Musketeers decided to release the code after a group of rival hackers obtained the code and planned to sell it. While this is not the first time the PlayStation 3 has been hacked, according to Eurogamer, \\"The release of the new custom firmware—and the LV0 decryption keys in particular—poses serious issues.\\" It also says that \\"options Sony has in battling this leak are limited\\" since \\"the reveal of the LV0 key basically means that any system update released by Sony going forward can be decrypted with little or no effort whatsoever\\".  History of updates  The \\"initial\\" release for the PlayStation 3 system software was version 1.10 as appeared on 11 November 2006 in Japan and 17 November 2006 in North America that provided the PlayStation Network services and the Remote Play for the 60 GB model. However, version 1.02 was included with some games. There were a number of updates in the 1.xx versions, which provided new features such as the Account Management, compatibility of USB devices for PlayStation 2 format games, and supports for USB webcams and Bluetooth keyboards and mice. Version 1.80 released on 24 May 2007 added a number of relatively small new features, mostly related to media and videos, such as the ability to upscale standard DVD-Videos to 1080p and to downscale Blu-ray video to 720p. Version 1.90 released on 24 May 2007 further added the Wallpaper feature for the background of XMB and the ability to eject a game disc using the controller, to re-order game icons by format and creation date. This update also forced 24 Hz output for Blu-ray over HDMI, and introduced bookmarks and a security function to the web browser. The last version in the 1.xx series was 1.94 released on 23 October 2007 that added support for DualShock 3 controllers. As with the version 1.xx series, there were a number of versions in the 2.xx and 3.xx series, released between 8 November 2007 and 20 September 2011. There were quite a few noticeable changes, and in version 2.10 alone there were new features such as the additions of the Voice Changer feature with the power to make users sound like a person using a voice changer with five presets over hi and low tones, a new music bitmapping process specifically designed for the PS3 to provide enhanced audio playback, as well as supports for DivX and WMV playback and Blu-ray disc profile 1.1 for picture-in-picture. Version 2.50 released on 15 October 2008 was the update in the 2.xx series that contained the largest number of new features or changes, among them were the support for official PS3 Bluetooth headset, in-game screenshots and Adobe Flash 9. A recovery menu (or safe mode) was also introduced in this version. Later versions in the 2.xx series such as the 2.7x, 2.85 or 2.90 were distributed with the PS3 \\"slim\\". Similar to versions such as 2.00, versions such as 3.00, 3.10, 3.30, 3.40 and 3.70 all introduced relatively large number of new features or changes, such as supports for new Dynamic Custom Themes, improvements in the Internet Browser, Trophy enhancements, and a new [Video Editor & Uploader] application. The most noticeable change in the version 4.00 released on 30 November 2011 was the added support for the PlayStation Vita handheld game consoles. For example, [PS Vita System] was added as an option and [PS Vita System Application Utility] has been added as a feature under [Game]. With this update, the PlayStation 3 also gained the ability to transfer videos, images, musics, and game data to and from the PlayStation Vita. Version 4.10 released on 8 February 2012 also added improvements to the Internet Browser including some support for HTML5 and its display speed and web page layout accuracy. Later versions in the 4.xx series all made a few changes to the system, mostly to improve the stability and operation quality during the uses of some applications, in addition to adding new features such as displaying closed captions when playing BDs and DVDs and \\"Check for Update\\" to the options menu for a game. The PlayStation 3 system software is currently still being updated by Sony. Withdrawal of update 2.40 System software version 2.40, which included the in-game XMB feature and PlayStation 3 Trophies, was released on 2 July 2008; however, it was withdrawn later the same day because a small number of users were unable to restart their consoles after performing the update. The fault was explained to have been because of certain system administrative data being contained in the HDD. The issue was addressed in version 2.41 of the system software released on 8 July 2008. Class action suit filed over update 3.0 System software version 3.0 was released on 1 September 2009. Shortly after its release, a number of users complained that the system update caused their system's Blu-ray drive to malfunction. In addition, John Kennedy of Florida filed a class action suit against Sony Computer Entertainment America(SCEA). John Kennedy had purchased a PlayStation 3 in January 2009, claiming it worked perfectly until he installed the required firmware update 3.0, at which point the Blu-ray drive in his system ceased functioning properly. Sony later released a statement, \\"SCEA is aware of reports that PS3 owners are experiencing isolated issues with their PS3 system since installing the most recent system software update (v3.00),\\" and released software update 3.01 on 15 September 2009. However, after installing 3.01, the plaintiff alleged the problems were not only not solved, but the new update created new issues as well. Class action suits filed over update 3.21 Due to the removal of the \\"OtherOS\\" feature from older models of the PS3 due to security issues (possibly related to the exploit released by geohot) which caused an uproar in the PlayStation community, several lawsuits have been filed. The first one was filed on behalf of PS3 owners by Anthony Ventura. The suit states that removing the feature constitutes breach of contract, false advertising and a handful of other business practices relating to consumer protection laws as the feature was touted by Sony when these systems were new as a way consumers could turn their machines into a basic PC and cites that the feature was \\"extremely valuable\\" and one of the main reasons that many people paid more for the PS3 over buying a competing console like a Wii or an Xbox 360. It also elaborates that anyone who does not accept the update can no longer play future games or future Blu-ray movie releases. Later on, two more suits were also filed by other members of the PlayStation 3 community. The first of these newer lawsuits was filed by Todd Densmore and Antal Herz which claim Sony has rendered several PlayStation 3 features they paid for \\"inoperable\\" as a result of the release of firmware 3.21. The second filed was by Jason Baker, Sean Bosquett, Paul Graham, and Paul Vannatta, and claims, among other things, that they \\"lost money by purchasing a PS3 without receiving the benefit of their bargain because the product is not what it was claimed to be - a game console that would provide both the Other OS feature and gaming functions.\\" A fourth lawsuit was filed by Keith Wright and seeks compensation equal to the cost of the console. A fifth lawsuit was filed by Jeffrey Harper and Zachary Kummer which calls for a jury trial. A sixth lawsuit was filed by Johnathon Huber and has quotes from both the EU and US PlayStation blogs. Sony responded to the lawsuits by requesting a dismissal on the grounds that \\"no one cared about the feature\\" and that the filings cite quotes from 3rd party websites, the instruction manual, the PlayStation Web site and claims they are invalid proof and that Sony can disable PSN and the other advertised features (playing games that require newer firmware, etc.) as they wish. The lawyers for the plaintiffs reviewed the request and said that this is fairly common at this stage of the process and that the case would be reviewed before a judge in November 2010. In February 2011 all claims of false advertising in the case were dismissed but the plaintiffs were allowed to appeal and amend the case and the other claims that the removal violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse act were allowed to go forward. In March 2011 the plaintiffs amended their complaint to refute Sony's claims that it was within its rights under the TOS and warranty to remove the feature adding more details to their claims including breach of warranty, breach of implied warranty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of several California unfair business practices laws. In April 2011 SCEA again asked that the case be dismissed and made claims that the plaintiffs refiled claim was insufficient and that they were hackers and wanted to violate Sony's intellectual property and asked the judge to grant search rights on their PS3 systems. SCEA also made claims that they were not the division solely responsible for the removal and should not be held responsible despite conflicting information to the contrary. On 18 April 2011 the plaintiffs fired back at Sony's renewed efforts to have the case dismissed by pointing out the fact that Sony had made many of the same claims before and that they had been dismissed by the court and also pointed out several legal precedents under California law that refuted Sony's claims. In December 2011 the whole case was dismissed under the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they could expect the \\"Other OS\\" feature beyond the warranty of the machine. However this decision was overturned in a 2014 appellate court decision finding that plaintiffs had indeed made clear and sufficiently substantial claims. Ultimately, in 2016, Sony settled with users who installed Linux or purchased a PlayStation 3 based upon the alternative OS functionality. Withdrawal of update 4.45 System software version 4.45 was released on 18 June 2013; however, it was withdrawn one day later because a small number of users were unable to restart their consoles after performing the update. On 21 June 2013, Morgan Haro, a Community Manager for PlayStation Network, announced that the issue had been identified and a new update was planned to be released to resolve the issue. The system update that addressed this issue, version 4.46 was released on 27 June 2013, and a fix for those affected by system version 4.45 was also provided by Sony.

In May 2016, the Center was renamed the Muskegon Innovation Center and the organization refocused on supporting innovation and entrepreneurship. History and development Development and planning for the center began in 1999 when a group of Grand Valley State University faculty and Muskegon business people proposed a research and development facility focused on alternative energy. Subsequent partnerships between the business, community, and the private sector resulted in groundbreaking for the center in late 2002, and its completion in 2003. The building The facility was powered, in part, by a fuel cell and a micro turbine, which turned natural gas into electricity. In addition, the building's photovoltaic solar roof tiles harnessed the solar power generated by the sun to create useful energy. MAREC then used a nickel metal hydride battery system to store some of the energy produced by these sources for use during peak energy consumption periods. The building was also constructed using many alternative and renewable building materials including flooring surfaces produced from fast-growing bamboo and recycled tires, and rigid wall surfaces made from pressed wheat. These materials were used to conserve and recycle valuable natural resources. Economic development MAREC was part of the Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone, a joint venture with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the city of Muskegon, and Grand Valley State University. The Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone is intended to promote and attract high technology business development in Muskegon and the region. MAREC had of space devoted to incubating businesses that would research and develop alternative energy sources and uses. The focus on alternative energy was expected to be a catalyst for economic development and job growth in the area. Research and development initiatives was also intended to fuel business expansion at Edison Landing, the SmartZone being transformed into a multi-use office, retail, and residential center. Overall SmartZone development was expected to complement the array of human, physical, and capital investments made at MAREC.

As an orthodox materialist, he was a lifetime member of the Communist Party, and influential Marxist scholar in the analyses on Japanese history conducted by members of the post-war Rekiken group. In the 1950s, after the success of the communist revolution in China in 1949, he espoused that model as the Asian alternative to Westernization, which had failed in Japan.  Life  Born in his mother's family house in Hokkaidō, Ishimoda was raised in what is now Ishinomaki city, Miyagi Prefecture, where his father was mayor. He enrolled in the faculty of philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, but switched to Japanese history. On graduation he became a journalist for the Asahi Shimbun, then professor at Hosei University. In 1973 he was diagnosed as suffering from Parkinson's disease.  Works  His first major work \\"The formation of the medieval world\\" was written before the war. but the manuscript was destroyed when his house went up in flames during a wartime incendiary bombing raid over Tokyo. A legend often mentioned by prominent academics to their students has it that, soon after war's end, he returned to what remained of his house, shut himself in for a summer and rewrote the whole work. According to the afterword by Ishii Susumu appended to a popular reprint of this work however, he secluded himself in a room of his home in October 1944, and, with the curtains drawn, wrote out the whole 700 page manuscript within just one month.Much of this article is translated from the equivalent article in the Japanese Wikipedia, as retrieved on June 24, 2007 Recently Ishimoda's historical materialism has come in for criticism.Yoshihiko Amino, Ishii Susumu (eds)『Nihon no Chūsei 6 Toshi to Shokunōmin no katsudō』, Chūō Kōronsha, Tokyo 2003,(2) Mikawa Kei (美川圭) 『Insei-mō hitotsu no tennōsei』, Chūō Kōronsha, Tokyo, 2006 However it cannot be denied that he prompted and quickened the reconstruction of the discipline in postwar world of Japanese historical studies, which at the time was caught up in the chaos and stagnation caused by the collapse of an historicism centered on Japan's Imperial institution.

The term generally refers to innovation that takes place outside science & technology sectors, which are the primary sectors which invest in formal R&D; and patents. For example, although technological innovations are often developed in the oil & gas sector through oil exploration activities, these innovations are unaccounted for in innovation metrics because oil exploration is not counted as formal R&D.; Other types of innovation, including social innovation, can be classed as hidden innovation. Although originally coined in the 90s by Diana Hicks and Sylvan Katz in their research on the hidden research system involving hospital researchers, and Mike Hopkins research on genetic testing within the UK healthcare system, the concept of hidden innovation has most recently been promoted by NESTA, in their \\"Innovation Gap\\" Report, published October 2006. A later report, called \\"Hidden innovation\\", further expands on the concept and identifies four types of hidden innovation: # Innovation that is the same or similar to activities that are measured by traditional indicators, but which is excluded from measurement. # Innovation without a major scientific/technological basis, such as innovation in organizational forms or business models. # Innovation created from the novel combination of existing technologies and processes. # Locally developed, small-scale innovations that take place 'under the radar' and are therefore unrecognised or accounted for.

Croghan. Fort Croghan was the third of the first four forts established by the United States government to protect settlers from hostile Indians along the Texas frontier. From its establishment on March 18, 1849 by Lt. C.H. Taylor (Company A, Second Dragoons) until it was abandoned in 1855, Fort Croghan was home to Company C, 8th Infantry, U.S.A. (mounted) and eventually became the headquarters of the Second Dragoon Regiment. Part of a chain of forts extending from Fort Worth to Fort Inge near present-day Uvalde, the fort was named for Colonel George Croghan. The fort originally covered some near the present day city of Burnet, Texas, extending from Hamilton Creek up and over Post Mountain. Today a small section exists due to the efforts of the Burnet County Historical Society who raised money in the 1960s to purchase this portion of the old fort.Crimmins, M.L., 1943, The First Line of Army Posts Established in West Texas in 1849, Abilene: West Texas Historical Association, Vol. XIX, pp. 121-127 Early history In the 1840s, upon the annexation of Texas to the United States, the federal government became responsible for the protection of frontier settlers from Indian raids. Several companies of Texas Rangers, financed by the federal government, were stationed along the frontier. In December 1847, a company of Rangers under the command of Henry Eustace McCulloch took up a position about three miles (5 km) south of present-day Burnet. Samuel E. Holland purchased a grant there in 1848, including the land on which the Ranger station was located. His residence built on that land is said to have been the first permanent home in Burnet County. 1.Darrell debo Burnet County History The indigenous peoples of the Americas had occupied this region for thousands of years, but did not build or live in permanent homes, theirs being a migratory culture. In the late 1840s, it became apparent that the lure of free and cheap land had thrust many settlers far beyond the protection of civilization.Frontier Forts > Texas and the Western Frontier More and more settlers arrived, many of them from foreign countries. Some came expecting to acquire good farmland near the Texas coast. They soon learned that they would have to move hundreds of miles inland and the only land left was marginal rangeland. Indians who had been peaceful due to treaties and the presence of the United States soldiers during the U.S.-Mexican War now began to come into conflict with these newcomers. The Comanche and Apache were particularly incensed at this intrusion into their ancient hunting grounds. At first, the government wanted to build Fort Croghan near Holland Springs. Burnet County's first white resident, Sam Holland, objected strenuously to a military post being located near his home. It was then decided to locate the fort a few miles north on Hamilton Creek. There was no more important consideration than a year-round source of abundant clean water. Water was needed for many functions as well as drinking water for people and animals. Anvil and stump from Smithwick Mills, home of Noah Smithwick, early Fort blacksmith. All the necessary buildings - including a hospital, bakery, officers' quarters, enlisted men's huts, powderhouse, horse and mule lots, blacksmith shop, storage buildings and a lookout building on top of Post Mountain - were constructed by the soldiers. In October 1849, Company C. 8th Infantry, U.S.A. Mounted arrived to occupy this newly constructed fort. Fort Croghan consisted of the usual log cabins enclosed by a strong stockade. It was manned by one company of cavalry and one of infantry. The first commander was Captain Phillip St. George Cook. Captain Cook soon resigned his position and was followed by Captains; Blake, Lee and Sibley. Some of the soldiers settled in the area and stayed on after the Fort was decommissioned. Christian Dorbandt, later sheriff of Burnet County was one of these men.3.Smithwick, Noah Evolution of a State Copyright 1900 Noah Smithwick worked as an armorer for the fort. House built by Logan Vandeveer for his father, William. A small town soon grew up across Hamilton Creek as merchants and other suppliers of services moved to be near the fort. Logan Vandeveer and Peter Kerr were among the first to obtain contracts to furnish the fort with beef and other foodstuffs. In 1852 Vandeveer was instrumental in petitioning the Texas Legislature to authorize the creation of Burnet County. The town was first called Hamilton or Hamilton Valley, but in 1858 the name was changed to Burnet also. Fort Croghan was abandoned in December 1853, having served its purpose. The last building there was demolished in the 1920s and the old fort was forgotten as the town grew and prospered. Fort Croghan Restoration Cabin interior, note the trundle bed. In the 1960s, a group of citizens interested in preserving this part of Burnet County and the city of Burnet's past formed the Burnet County Historical Society and raised the money to purchase the present day grounds. Early presidents of the Burnet County Historical Society included; Rethie Dorbandt, Ed Young, Virgil Lewis, Tad Moses, Jimsey Husted, Phyllis Adrian, Reta Ross, Clyde Mather, Mrs. T.D. Bryant, W.C. Galloway, Mather Dorbandt, and Donald Duncan. 4.The Burnet Bulletin Newspaper Thursday July 26, 1973 Local landowners donated the historical cabins which were moved to the fort grounds and reassembled exactly as they were.

Denmark is also credited for many of the illustrations of the cards. In a Dungeoneer game, players are involved in an RPG-like adventure, in which they have to explore an area, face monsters and other threats, and solve perilous quests. Each set consists of 55 or 110 cards of different types: * White-backed \\"map\\" cards, used to create the dungeon/wilderness area; * Green-backed \\"hero\\" cards, which serve as the players' character sheet; * Purple-backed \\"quest\\" cards, which define the specific goals of each player; * Brown-backed \\"adventure\\" cards, representing spells, treasure, monsters and threats. During each game turn, players alternatively take on the role of the \\"dungeon lord\\", who unleashes monsters and traps on his opponents, and of the adventurer who explores the dungeon trying to solve his quests. The game is won either by a dungeon lord who defeats all of his opponents, or by an adventurer who successfully solves three quests. The sets in the series The first set, simply called \\"Dungeoneer\\" was originally released by Citizen Games, but was later released by Atlas games, with some significant changes (both in the looks and in the game mechanics) and a new name, \\"Tomb of the Lich Lord\\", in November 2003. \\"Tomb of the Lich Lord\\" is much of a classic dungeon crawl, a crypt filled with undead and classical sword-and-sorcery archetypes. The first set has been followed by several others, each one with new cards and a different background: ; Vault of the Fiends (2003) : A twisted mage has built an impenetrable vault in which to pursue his heinous experiments. Horrendous fiends now plague the countryside, terrorizing helpless peasants and destroying vital crops. The people cry out for great heroes to confront this evil. Do you have the courage to enter the deadly Vault of the Fiends? ; Haunted Woods of Malthorin (2004) : The betrothed of an elven prince was brutally slain on the day of their wedding. The mad bridegroom now uses his powerful magic to turn his forest realm into a horrific haunted nightmare. Do you have the courage to bring peace to these cursed woods? ; Den of the Wererats (2004) : A master wererat and his transformed minions hold the city in fear. Vermin and shapeshifters, thieves and cutthroats lurk in every shadow. Can you face your fears and eradicate this sinister infestation? ; Dragons of the Forsaken Desert (2005) : Long ago the sorcery of the Eldritch Lords transformed fertile plains into a desolate waste. Now the crumbling ruins of a great civilization litter the landscape, and only the remnants of the people known as the Drakan survive the harsh desert. But the mighty Dragon King has summoned legions of his kind and their lizard-men minions to lay claim to the desert. Can you defend the villages of the Drakan and defeat the vile dragon horde? ; Realm of the Ice Witch (2005) : Chohzar the Ice Witch has unleashed demons of cold to invade the warm southern lands and wrap them in her icy grip! Only the most hardy of heroes can venture into her frozen realm to stop her before all the world is embraced by her wintery spell! In addition, Atlas Games released two sets with higher-level heroes: Epic-level ; Call of the Lich Lord (2006) : The dark god of death and magic has raised his most faithful servant -- the Lich Lord -- back to undeath! Heroes who survived the Tomb of the Lich Lord have been called back, along with daring new allies, to destroy the Lich Lord forever. But his new crypt is more dangerous, his minions more powerful, and the Lich Lord himself more terrible now that he possesses the dark god's sinister gift -- the Scepter of the Shadow Plague. Legendary-level ; Wrath of the Serpent Goddess (2007) : The twisted Knights of Ilbor were banished after being corrupted by the serpent goddess Nakari. Now they've rebuilt their armies in the wastes and coupled with her priestesses to spawn unimaginable slithering horrors. Gather your courage to enter the serpentine temple, where you'll journey into the very heart of Nakari’s abysmal lair to rid the world of this blight. Gameplay Players take on the role of one of six heroes. Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores which increase as they level up through completing quests and each has a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent “Dungeonlord”, trying to exterminate the other heroes. You win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests, such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. The other method of winning is to defeat all the other heroes. Turn order for each player includes: * The Reset Phase where all temporary cards are discarded, and all traps and doors are relocked * The Dungeonlord Phase, in which you may play Monsters, Traps and Banes on opponents * Build Phase, in which the dungeon grows by laying down a Map card * The Hero Phase lets you move through the dungeon collecting Glory and Peril resources as you travel. You may spend an extra movement to lay another Map card. This is when you play Boons and Treasures for yourself. This is also when you are able to make an attempt to complete a Quest * Discard/Draw Phase in which you discard one card and draw up to five cards The dungeon is created by the laying of Map cards making the setup of each game different and dynamic. The quests necessary to win the game are fulfilled on specific Map cards. Combat is simple and consists each player involved rolling one six- sided die and adding either the Magic or Melee score of the monster and the hero it is attacking. Traps, doors, and other hazards are overcome by rolling equal to or above the objects Threat. Example: Movement 5+. Add your heroes movement skill of 2 to a die roll of 3 or better.

Floating factory converts giants of the deep into marketable products. Santa Monica Evening Outlook. 30 January 1936, p. 8, Santa Monica, California. Nial O’Malley Keyes, in his book Blubber Ship, reported large numbers of whales were caught within a mile of Malibu (in or before 1934), a reference to the Point Dume operation.O'Malley-Keyes, Nial Edward Brendon, Blubber Ship; George G. Harrap & Company, Limited, 1939, pp. 49-50. ..... Up until the 1940s, Point Dume was a windblown, treeless bluff covered by native chaparral. Post-World War II the bluff became slowly settled by independent-minded people, who planted trees and other non-native flora among their single-family homesteads. In 1968, Point Dume Elementary School opened, but closed in 1980. It reopened in 1996 and remains open today, now known as the Point Dume Marine Science Elementary School. By 2007, many of the simple homesteads were torn down to make way for mansions and mega-mansions behind walls, many with expansive ocean views, while other large homes were surrounded by mature trees. State preserve California Historical Monument 965 The northwesternmost tip of Point Dume has been designated Point Dume Nature Preserve.Point Dume State Beach Located along Cliffside Drive, very limited parking is available. Its beach is protected by the Lifeguard unit of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Street parking is available on Grasswood, a short walk from the headlands. The cove, located just south of the point, was a popular clothing-optional meeting spot in the 1960s and '70s.  Rock climbing  Point Dume viewed from the air, facing northwest Point Dume is home to a handful of very moderate single pitch rock climbing routes that are usually climbed on top rope from established fixed anchors.Rock Climbing Routes in Point Dume It is a common place to take novice climbers due to the ease of access, ease of routes, as well as the beautiful and unique setting for rock climbing. Filming location Planet of the Apes series were filmed at Point Dume. The cliff face of the Point is obscured by the matte painting of the Statue of Liberty. With its close proximity to the film and television industry location, Point Dume's Westward Beach continues to be a popular filming location for films, television, advertisements, and videos, appearing frequently whenever a beach scene is needed. Jackie Treehorn’s beach party in The Big Lebowski was filmed near the cliff face. Important scenes in the Planet of the Apes series were filmed at Point Dume's Westward Beach. In the Iron Man films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the protagonist Tony Stark's huge seaside mansion was set on Point Dume at the edge of a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, and was given the fictional address of 10880 Malibu Point, 90265. The interior shots were filmed on real sets, but the mansion itself is fictional, instead being created as a 3D model and digitally placed on the cliffs in post-production; Point Dume is a protected area, so construction on its cliffs is strictly prohibited. The ashes of American horror movie actor Vincent Price were scattered here in 1993.Vincent Price Legacy The music video Sandcastles in the Sand for the TV show How I Met Your Mother was filmed on Point Dume State Beach. The season 3 finale of Angel was set on cliffs above Point Dume State Beach, but was filmed to the west at Leo Carrillo State Park. The TV series Son of the Beach was frequently filmed on Point Dume State Beach. An episode of the television series Modern Family was filmed on Point Dume State Beach. The pilot episode of I Dream of Jeannie was filmed at Point Dume, which served as the deserted South Pacific island where astronaut Tony Nelson's (Larry Hagman) capsule washed ashore and he released Jeannie (Barbara Eden) from 2,000 years of imprisonment. The wedding in the season 2 finale of Chuck was filmed on Point Dume State Beach. The season 1 episode \\"Dominoes\\" of the television series Scorpion was mostly set at Point Dume. In 1984 and 1988, Point Dume stood in for Stefano DiMera's underground cliff base on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives.

At the time of its release, it was the highest- budgeted South Korean film of all time. The film was a box office success, grossing almost $100 million worldwide. It received generally negative reviews from critics. Plot The story follows the adventures of Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr), charged in his childhood by the enigmatic Jack (Robert Forster) to protect the Yuh Yi Joo, an individual who had been born able to change an Imoogi chosen by heaven into a Celestial Dragon, from a corrupt Imoogi identified as \\"Buraki\\", who was prevented from obtaining it in the past by Ethan and Jack's previous incarnations. To this end, Jack gives Ethan a medallion formerly belonging to Ethan's previous incarnation Haram, and reveals that the reincarnated Yuh Yi Joo is Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks), whom Ethan will find in Los Angeles. 15 years after this revelation, Buraki invades the city, bent on capturing Sarah; whereupon Ethan, now a television news anchor, rescues her, conveys the knowledge of her purpose, and attempts to save her from Buraki, during which they eventually regain the memories of their past lives. During the resulting chase, Buraki's \\"Atrox Army\\" enters the city and engages the United States Army, the United States Air Force, and the Los Angeles Police Department in battle. Here, the Atrox Army is shown to consist of black-armored, humanoid knight warriors; theropod-like cavalry called \\"Shaconnes\\"; small, winged Western dragons called \\"Bulcos\\"; and immense, slow-moving reptiles carrying rocket-launchers on their backs, identified in the dialogue as \\"Dawdlers\\". Despite losses, this army overwhelms the human forces, while Ethan and Sarah escape the city, but are subsequently captured by the Bulcos and taken to a menacing fortress in the midst of a darkened desert landscape. There, as Buraki emerges from the fortress to consume Sarah, Ethan's medallion unleashes power that destroys the Atrox Army. Ethan then attempts to prevent Buraki from consuming Sarah, but he is knocked away, whereupon the Good Imoogi of whom the power in Sarah was to be given, emerges from the fortress and attacks Buraki. The two Imoogi, good and evil, engage each other in a duel that Buraki appears to win after seemingly snapping the Good Imoogi's neck. After this, Buraki again approaches Sarah, who finally offers herself willingly; but instead gives her power to the injured Good Imoogi who absorbs it. Sarah faints, and Buraki can do nothing as the Good Imoogi becomes the Celestial Dragon, continuing the duel until it finally destroys Buraki. After Buraki is destroyed, Ethan watches Sarah dissolve into a spirit form, and the Celestial Dragon permits her to speak to Ethan, whom she assures that they shall see each other again, and promises to \\"love...for all eternity\\"; then withdraws Sarah into its body and ascends into the sky, through the parting clouds to the heavens. Jack appears behind Ethan, reminding him that the two of them \\"have been given a great honor\\" to take part in this transformation, and vanishes. After whispering \\"Goodbye old man\\", Ethan walks away into the desert.

The film was announced in 2002 by director Shim Hyung-rae as his follow-up project to 1999's Yonggary. The budget was set at 30 million won (approximately US$35 million),Barnes, Brooks. The New York Times (10 September 2007): \\"New Tactics Aim to Make Korean Film a Hit in the U.S.\\" but ultimately went over budget in order to create the various creatures in the film, with some outside estimation as high as $US75 million dollars. The DVD release confirmed that it did indeed cost US$99 million. As with Yonggary, Shim opted for a mostly American cast. Veteran actor Robert Forster landed a pivotal role and Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks were cast as the two young leads. The next three years were spent creating the creature effects, all of which were done in house by Shim's Younggu-Art Movies company. The completed film premiered at the American Film Market in early 2007. The film was released in South Korea on 1 August 2007. In the U.S., the film was released on 14 September 2007 by Freestyle Releasing. On 7 August 2007, South Korea's Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) Morning Live TV Show broadcast the film's final scene on TV without the permission of the studio, causing a controversy. A few days later the Ministry of Culture and Tourism released a statement in which they said that the incident did not violate South Korean copyright laws. Release A 110-minute cut was shown at the American Film Market on 4 November 2006 and at the Berlin Film Market on 8 February 2007. The film's final cut was edited down to 92 minutes for its South Korean and American release, after getting feedback from preview screenings. The film was released in South Korea on 1 August 2007. Freestyle Releasing released the film in the United States on 14 September 2007 on 1,500 screens. Reception D-War received mostly negative reviews upon release in the U.S. and was not screened in advance for many critics. , the film holds a 30% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 37 reviews with an average rating of 3.63/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Dragon Wars special effects can't make up for an unfocused script and stale acting.\\". The film scored a 33 out of 100 at Metacritic, based on nine reviews indicating \\"general unfavorable reviews\\". Derek Elley of Variety, reviewing it at the Berlin Film Festival's market section, called it \\"visually entertaining, and superior to helmer Shim Hyung- rae's last monster movie (Yonggary in 1999)\\", while also saying the film had a \\"Z-grade, irony-free script,\\" and \\"likely to end up the most expensive cult movie on DVD.\\"Elley, Derek. Variety (review posted 9 February 2007) The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck said, \\"the CGI effects are undeniably impressive\\" but that \\"the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor ... seriously detract from the fun.\\"Scheck, Frank. The Hollywood Reporter (review posted 17 September 2007) Luke Y. Thompson in L.A. Weekly derided the film as one \\"for connoisseurs of the 'totally preposterous crap' school of fantasy cinema... You know who you are: You have all the Warlock sequels on Laserdisc [and] the complete Leprechaun series on DVD\\" and says it's \\"funnier when it tries to be serious than when it goes for the gag.\\"Thompson, Luke Y. L.A. Weekly (review published 12 September 2007) Within nine days of its South Korean release, D-War attracted five million viewers, setting a national box office record for an opening week. The seemingly positive reaction from the Korean population, as indicated by the movie's box office success in Korea, was widely attributed to the film's appeal to Korean nationalism; a logical impression drawn from Shim's message at the end of the Korean version of this film, \\"D-War and I will succeed in the world market without fail,\\" accompanied by the Korean folk anthem, \\"Arirang.\\" However, despite box office success, D-Wars was far from critically acclaimed by either Korean critics or Korea's general public. Korean film critic Kim Bong-sok said, \\"They want it to be successful in the U.S. because it's Korean, not because it's good\\" and called the film \\"immature and poorly made\\" and \\"below criticism\\". Other reactions from Korean critics have been similar. D-War set a record of grossing US$20.3 million in South Korea in its first five days of release. As of 1 September, the film has grossed US$44 million in Korea and another US$10 million in other countries, totaling a worldwide gross of US$54 million as of 16 September. In North America, the film grossed US$5 million on 2,275 screens in its opening weekend. As of 25 November 2007, the film has grossed US$10,977,721 in North America,Dragon Wars (2007) Since then, D-War has been released theatrically in Malaysia and China, both with moderate critical reaction. China was the only one to live up to the South Korean release record, spawning 3,000,000 admissions and a premiere including pop idol Libing Chen. The movie was a box office failure in Japan. Sequel In March 2016, it was announced that a sequel entitled D-War II: Mysteries of the Dragon would be co-financed with China's H&R; Global Pictures. The film's release date is to be determined.

Toeplitz is a French composer and musician of Polish origin, born in 1960. He lives in Paris.  Biography  He has worked with academic research organizations, such as GMEM, GRM, IRCAM, and Radio-France, as well as with experimental musicians, such as Éliane Radigue, Zbigniew Karkowski, Dror Feiler, Tetsuo Furudate, Phill Niblock and Art Zoyd . Citing Giacinto Scelsi and Iannis Xenakis as influences, his early work was mostly written for traditional instruments. He received several prizes and distinctions for these works: 1st prize in composition for orchestra at the festival of Besançon, 1st prize in the Opéra Autrement/Acanthes competition, Villa Médicis Hors-les-Murs in New York, prize Léonard de Vinci in San Francisco, Villa Kujoyama in Kyoto, and DAAD in Berlin. He has also written for his electric guitar orchestra, Sleaze Art. He then integrated computers into his work, via the programming language MAX. His experimentation with computers continued, in 2003, with the creation of an instrument he calls the BassComputer, an electric bass with 5 fretted strings and 4 unfretted strings, as in the harp guitar. The instrument is intended to be interfaced with a computer. In 2004, he commissioned a piece from Eliane Radigue called Elemental II, which he interpreted for the BassComputer. This was an opportunity for him to set up his own label, ROSA (Recordings Of Sleaze Art). He later commissioned Phil Niblock’s Yam almost may (Touch Records TO59), and Dror Feiler’s Ousia. He also recorded Capture, one of his own compositions, on ROSA (Rosa#2, 2005), as well as ZKT, by Le Dépeupleur, a laptop duet, formed with Zbigniew Karkowski, and which has been together since 1999 (Rosa#3, 2006). He has also written for dance (Myriam Gourfink, Loic Touzé, Olivia Granville, Emmanuelle Huynh, Hervé Robbe, Artefact, Christian Trouillas, Jean-Marc Matos), as well as theatre; he has always shown a great interest in literature (J'irai vers le nord, j'irai dans la nuit polaire, his first opera, was based on Sylvia Plath's texts, as was Great Expectations on Kathy Acker's texts; Ruine was composed on a François Bon text), and more recently he has developed \\"combined\\" pieces, mixing light and/or video images (K_apture, for computer solo, on Dominik Barbier's videos). In 2007 he created, with Eryck Abecassis and Wilfried Wendling, KERNEL, a computer ensemble devoted to interpretation, live stricto sensu (without any samples or sequences), of electronic music compositions. Press * About The Deep, a piece written by Kasper T. Toeplitz for KERNEL in 2008, Dan Warburton, for Paris Transatlantic Magazine : \\"The Deep is the latest composition - and we're definitely talking composition here: you can even check out the score online at the sleazeart website, and very interesting it is too - by Kasper Toeplitz for KERNEL, his laptop trio with Eryck Abecassis and Wilfried Wendling. There's plenty of information about the group and their instrumentation (i.e. software, for the most part) at the sleazeart site, but no amount of background reading and scrutiny of KTT's pdfs (you'll need a smattering of French) can prepare you for the impressive 59'33\\" of The Deep. Since Paul D. Miller and his chums made Xenakis suddenly hip a few years back, far too many musicians have been quick to claim some kind of Xenakis street cred, but very few compositions pack the clout of Bohor or La Légende d'Eer. Happy to report that The Deep is one of them. Toeplitz has a real feel not only for the large form - which is not simply a question of taking a short form and stretching it out: ask Eliane Radigue, who worked closely with KTT on the realisation of her Elemental II back in 2004 - but for the surface and texture of the sounds he and his playing partners choose to articulate it. Any self-respecting fan of Xenakis, Radigue or EAI for that matter (putting any anti-composer prejudice aside) should check this splendid work out at the earliest opportunity.\\" * About ZKT, the second release by Le Dépeupleur, K.T. Toeplitz and Z. Karkowski laptop duet, Keith Moliné, in The Wire (May 2006, \\"Outer Limits\\") : \\"Le Dépeupleur is the name by which the ongoing collaboration between veteran sound artists Toeplitz and Karkowski has been known since the late 90s. in a field dominated by solo performers, both do much of their best work in partnership with others: Toeplitz has performed with Art Zoyd, among others, while Karkowski has released albums with such luminaries of noise and non-noise as Merzbow and The Hafler Trio.It's the latter's recent work that this album most resembles: another single 50 minute track that reveals itself steadily over its first 30 minutes and then recedes slowly into silence, the duo managing to imbue their minimalism with a sense of geniue mystery. It's a challenging listen and though it makes few concessions to conventional notions of beauty, it never alienates. Oscillating feedback tones, blurred at the edges by a spray of soft white noise, are woven into the tough gossamer thread that spins out of the piece's duration. Le Dépeupleur demands attention and rewards it correspondingly.\\" * About Elemental II, a piece commissioned to Eliane Radigue, played on the BassComputer and released by K.T. Toeplitz on r.o.s.a, 2005 (this CD is in the 50 records of the year chosen by The Wire), Dan Warburton, in The Wire : \\"Commissioned and first performed in January 2004 by bassist Kasper T. Toeplitz, Elemental II is the inaugural release of Toeplitz's label r.o.s.a., which stands for Recordings Of Sleaze Art - though sleazy is about the last adjective in the world one would choose to describe the music of Eliane Radigue. Often misleadingly associated with the musique concrète establishment through her work with Pierre Henry, the mystery and magic of Radigue's music occupies a twilight zone of minimalism between the static drones of Young, Conrad and Niblock and the gradual processes of Reich and Glass. It's forever on the move, albeit very slowly - speed it up fivefold in some music software and you'll be surprised - but constructed so meticulously that it somehow slips of time altogether. Based on an earlier work dating from 1968, Elemental II is devised as an evocation of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), its 50 minutes falling into five dovetailing sections of roughly equal length. The beginning of each new section is clearly perceptible, but elsewhere the slow changes characteristic of her music seem to take place under the surface of the music, as it were. It's very much a native source emerging freely from the earth (the composer's descriptions would be twee if they weren't so spot on), with change perceived as having taken place than taking place. however many times you listen - and this is music you will return to on many occasions - you'll probably never quite figure out how she did it. As elusive as the music itself is Toeplitz's own contribution, as nothing resembles the electric bass he's credited as playing.\\" Several works *Nature Morte : for orchestra, 1988. *Zéline : for violoncello solo, 1989. *Paysage foudroyé : for electric bass solo, 1989. *J'irai vers le nord, j'irai dans la nuit polaire : opera based on Sylvia Plath's texts, (1st prize in the «Opéra Autrement» competition, Centre Acanthes), 1989. *Lhow : for orchestra (1st prize in composition for orchestra at the festival of Besançon), 1990. *Anachorète : for soprano saxophone solo, 1991. *Memory- Cendres : for a woman's voice, percussions, clarinet and double bass, 1992. *Sthill : for 8 saxophones, 1992. *Blind Sucht :for 9 instruments and electroacoustic dispositive, 1993. *Ephémérides : for 9 instruments, 1995. *Siyahi : for orchestra, 1996. *Stances d'orchestre : for orchestra, 1997. *Je est une autre : for voice, violoncello, clarinet, double bass and percussions, 1997. *Ruine :for orchestra and soprano solo, on a François Bon text, 1998. *Biel : for orchestra and samplers, 2000. *Appars/Vague de pas : for small orchestra, electronic keyboard and percussions, 2001. *Battling Siki : opera for strings, electronics instruments, theremin, percussions and computers, 2003. *Froz#5 : for tubax and computer, 2003. *Contraindre, for theremin (Laurent Dailleau), chor.

The population size was 4,047 as of December 31, 2009.  History  In 1539 embankment of the polder Het Westmaas Nieuwland was started. The lords reserved a part of the nieuw land for the new to found village Claeswaal. The first buildings were built along the Voorstraat. At the end of this street, a church was built in 1566. Originally, it was built as a Catholic church, but the pastor of Strijen didn't want to come to the village as he considered the distance as too far. The community found a minister who was willing to hold the services, and therefore the services were of a Protestant nature. In 1602 the embankment of the Nieuw-Cromstrijense polder was finished. Since then, Klaaswaal doesn't have a connection with the Hollands Diep anymore.

Hurd is an academic specialising in biology. He is an Associate Professor aligned to the Department of Psychology's Biocognition Unit, and the University's Centre for Neuroscience at the University of Alberta. His research primarily focuses on the study of the evolution of aggressive behaviour, including investigation of aggression, communication and other social behaviour which takes place between animals with conflicting interests. Major tools for this research are mathematical modeling (principally game theory and genetic algorithms). He is also interested in how the process of sexual differentiation produces individual differences in social behaviour. Hurd conducted a study on digit ratios suggesting a positive correlation in males between aggressive tendency and the ratio of the lengths of the ring finger to his index finger. These gathered significant media attention, being reported on the BBC,Article on The BBC website (Retrieved June 2007) in the New York Times,Nicholas Bakalar, \\"What else His Ring Finger Says\\" the New York Times, D6 (2005) Discover Magazine,Discover magazine Article Scientific American Mind,Scientific American Mind article National GeographicSummary of National Geographic Article and on Jay Leno.Research Overview with Reference to Jay Leno Research Evolution of animal signalling Some of Hurd's most cited papers deal with the evolution of mating displays, specifically the idea that sexually selected traits have evolved to exploit previously existing biases in the sensory, or recognition, systems of their receivers, rather than being handicapped displaysHurd PL, Wachtmeister C-A & Enquist M, 1995.

American Naturalist 161: 380-394. Hurd has argued against the handicap principle view of animal communication, demonstrating the evolutionary stability of conventional (non-handicap) threat displays using game theoretical models.Hurd PL, 1997.

Hurd attributes the preponderance of handicap models in biology to the use of simple signalling games which are incapable of modelling conventional signalling.Hurd PL & Enquist M. 2005. A strategic taxonomy of biological communication. Animal Behaviour 70: 1155-1170. Aggressiveness Hurd has classified models of fighting behaviour into those driven by: 1) fighting ability (aka resource holding potential), 2) perceived value of winning, and 3) aggressiveness and argues that if variation in the last trait -aggressiveness- exists in a biologically meaningful way, it ought to be fixed for life at an early stage of development.Hurd PL. 2006. Resource holding potential, subjective resource value, and game theoretical models of aggressiveness signalling. Journal of Theoretical Biology 241: 639-648. Many studies on both human, and non-human, animals suggest that inter-individual variation in adult aggressiveness is largely organised by prenatal exposure to androgens. Digit ratio (2D:4D, the ratio of index to ring finger length) is a widely used as a proxy measure for prenatal testosterone exposure. Hurd demonstrated that men with more feminine typical-digit ratios showed lower aggressive tendency than males with more masculine-typical digit ratios.Bailey AA & Hurd PL, 2005. Finger length ratio predicts physical aggression in men but not women. Biological Psychology 68: 215-222 Digit ratio Among his other research into digit ratio, Hurd has demonstrated that, while there is no difference in digit ratio between the sexes in most laboratory mice, that pups which gested next to brothers have higher digit ratios than those whose uterine neighbours were sisters,Bailey AA, Wahlsten D & Hurd PL, 2005.

Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer d'Entença, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term. Strength of forces Initially the Catalan Company, from Aragon, arrived in Constantinople in 1303 with 39 ships and 6,500 men, which consisted of 1,500 horsemen, 4,000 Almogavars and 1,000 footsoldiers, most of whom were Aragonese, Catalans and Valencians from the Crown of Aragon. These forces were later reinforced by 300 horseman and 1,000 Almogavars and later, they were joined by 300 horsemen and Berenguer d'Entença. After the murder of Roger de Flor the Byzantines killed so many of the Company that only 3,307 men remained. These numbers were further reduced to 206 horseman and 1,256 after an encounter with Genoese forces, according to Muntaner. Before leaving Gallipoli the company was joined by a Turkish force consisting of 800 horseman and 2,000 footsoldiers. Ramon Muntaner who was a soldier from Catalonia and chronicler, wrote that during a battle in 1304 the Company fought against nearly 30,000 Turks (10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry) of which 18,000 (6,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry) supposedly lay dead.

Born Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg, she was the eldest daughter of Duke Peter of Oldenburg and his wife Princess Therese of Nassau-Weilburg. She grew up in Russia in close proximity to the Romanovs as her father was a nephew of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. Alexandra’s parents were artistically gifted and passionate philanthropists. They provided a good education for her and inspired in Alexandra a life of service to those in need. Alexandra married in 1856, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia, the third son of Tsar Nicholas I and her first cousin once removed. Alexandra, who had been raised in the Lutheran church, converted to the Orthodox faith, and took the name Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Russia. The couple had two children: Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929), the younger, and Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia (1864–1931). The marriage, arranged by the Russian Imperial family in an attempt to control the Grand Duke’s excesses, was unhappy. She was plain, serious and liked simplicity. Deeply religious and very involved in charity work, Alexandra founded a training institute for nurses in St Petersburg in 1865. The same year, her husband began an affair with a ballerina, forming a second family with his mistress. After the collapse of her marriage, Alexandra lived separated from her husband who expelled her from their household in 1879. A carriage accident left her almost completely paralyzed and, in November 1880, Alexandra went abroad to improve her health, compelled by her brother-in-law Tsar Alexander II. The following year, she asked her nephew, Tsar Alexander III, to allow her to return to Russia and she settled in Kiev. She recovered her mobility and, in 1889, she founded the Pokrov of Our Lady Monastery, a convent of nursing nuns with its own hospital, to provide free treatment for the poor. She dedicated the rest of her life to the work at the hospital. In 1889, she became an Orthodox nun under the name Anastasia. She died at the convent in 1900.

She was well-liked by her two sisters-in-law Maria Alexandrovna and Alexandra Iosifovna.

Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 43 There, Alexandra used her White Lounge to stage charity bazaars and art exhibitions to raise money for orphans. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 43 In 1863, a church was added to her palace under the care of Alexandra's confessor, Archpriest Vasili Lebedev, who had great influence over the deeply devoted grand duchess. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 43 Lacking in beauty and social graces, Alexandra avoided court functions, instead of dividing her time between her charitable activities and farm work on the family's summer residence, Znamenka Palace, near Peterhof, which had been given to them as a wedding present. During the summer months at Znamenka, Nicholas and Alexandra entertained guests there. Grand Duchess Alexandra was also a gifted artist. She adorned the walls of Znamenka with her paintings.

As time went by, Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievich grew tired of Alexandra's increasing preoccupation with religion and began complaining of his wife's lack of glamour and distaste for society. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 44 In 1865, the grand duke started a permanent relationship with Catherine Chislova, a dancer from the Krasnoye Selo Theater. Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy, p. 140 Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 44 Nicholas Nicholaievich did not attempt to hide his affair.

King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 40 In 1868, Catherine Chislova gave birth to the first of the couple's five illegitimate children. King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 40 According to some sources, Alexandra Petrovna retaliated against her husband's infidelity by taking a lover and, in 1868, gave birth to an illegitimate son. King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 41 However, no sound information has surfaced to corroborate these claims. The story of the illegitimate child seems unlikely.Zeepvat, Djulber, p. 68 Alexandra Petrovna was deeply upset by her husband's infidelity.Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 45 She was torn between her duties, the breaking up of her marriage and the death of her sister Catherine Petrovna in 1866. By 1870, nothing was left of her marriage except the bitterness. Alexandra found solace in her two sons and her charity work while her husband divided his time between his children with Alexandra and his second family. The couple's palace in St. Petersburg was so large that they did not have to see each other. King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 40 Nicholas and Alexandra led separate lives, appearing together only in official ceremonies. King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 40 Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Russia in her nurse uniform. 1870s When the Grand Duke arranged a change of class into the gentry for his mistress and the couple's illegitimate children, Alexandra Petrovna appealed to Alexander II to intervene, but she found her brother-in-law less than sympathetic. \\"You see,\\" he bluntly told her, \\"your husband is in the prime of his life, and he needs a woman with whom he can be in love. And look at yourself! See even how you dress! No man would be attracted\\". King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 40 After this encounter, however, Alexander did advise his brother to be more discreet and exiled Catherine Chislova to Wenden, near Riga in 1875. Grand Duke Nicholas managed to have Chislova returned and had her installed with their illegitimate children in the Crimea. During the Russian-Turkish War, 1877–1878, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaievich commanded the Russian army of the Danube while Alexandra organized a sanitary unit at her own expense. After the end of the war, Grand Duke Nicholas spent most of his time in Crimea with his mistress while Grand Duchess Alexandra continued to live at their St Peterburg palace. In 1879, determined to get rid of his wife, Grand Duke Nicholas expelled Alexandra from the Nicholas Palace, publicly accusing her of infidelity with her confessor, Vasily Lebedev.Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 46 Grand Duchess Alexandra, leaving behind her jewelry, clothes and possessions, had to move to her parents' house. The same year, Alexandra suffered a carriage accident which left her almost completely paralyzed. She could move neither her legs nor her right arm. Alexandra asked her brother-in-law, Tsar Alexander II, for help. Appalled by the scandal, Alexander II was not sympathetic towards Alexandra and instead made her leave Russia indefinitely to seek medical treatment abroad. Alexander II himself paid for the trip expenses. Sister Anastasia In November 1880, the Grand Duchess left for Italy with her two sons on board the naval steamer Eriklik. She was hoping to find relief for her ailments in the mild climate of Naples. Her godson Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich and his brother Grand Duke Paul, who were on an Italian tour, visited her for two days. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 47 In January 1881, her estranged husband, Grand Duke Nicholas, arrived unexpectedly and took both their sons with him. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 According to Alexandra: he \\"made me experience things I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy\\". Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 Alexandra left Naples in early 1881 and sailed to Northern Greece. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 With the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in March 1881, Alexandra asked for help from her nephew Alexander III, Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 who was sympathetic towards her, unlike his father. Alexander III disliked his uncle and removed him from all his posts. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 He also lifted Alexandra's exile, allowing her to return to Russia. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 48 Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Russia, 1880s Alexandra started a new life in Kiev. Initially, she settled at the Mariyinsky Palace, the Emperor's residence in Kiev, in the hope that she could recover. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 She completely relied on religion for solace and comfort. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 Bound to a wheelchair, the Grand Duchess decided to stay in Kiev for good. This was convenient for her husband, who wanted to divorce her so he could marry his mistress. Alexandra vehemently refused to grant a divorce and Nicholas hoped that he could be a widower so he could remarry, as it had been the case of his brother Alexander II, who after his wife's death married his mistress. Alexandra, in spite of her poor health, outlived both her husband and her husband's mistress. Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy, p. 153 In Kiev, Alexandra's health did not improve for years. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 In 1888, she bought a plot of land near Voznessenskaya Hill. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 There, with the permission of Metropolitan and investing her own money, she founded the , a convent of nursing nuns with its own hospitals, asylums and dispensary to provide free treatment for the poor. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 In the summer of 1889, she recovered the mobility of her legs. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 49 She bandaged them tightly to relieve the pain.Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 51 Alexandra became a nun, as Sister Anastasia, taking Holy Orders on 3 November 1889 in Kiev, while her husband was still alive. For the rest of her life, she worked at the hospital performing nursing duties, helping contagious patents and cleaning infected wounds. She often assisted in surgeries. Last years  Sister Anastasia, formerly Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna Catherine Chislova died in 1889, and Grand Duke Nicholas survived his lover by only two years. When he died in the Crimea in 1891, Alexandra Petrovna did not attend the funeral. She also refused to pay homage to her dead husband when the funeral catafalque, taking his body for burial in the St Peter and St Paul Cathedral in St Petersburg, came by train via Kiev on its route from the south. Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy, p. 140 Alexandra's own health was poor. In May 1892, she underwent a successful breast cancer operation and spent some time in Corfu while she recuperated, returning to work in February 1893. The Grand Duchess remained close to her sons, who had taken her side in the family breakup. She was in the Crimea in 1898 when her daughter-in-law, Grand Duchess Militsa, gave birth to twin daughters, one of whom died shortly after birth. Alexandra took her granddaughter’s remains with her and buried the coffin in the convent cemetery in Kiev.Zeepvat, Djulber, p. 68 Afflicted with stomach cancer, Alexandra Petrovna died at Kievo Pechersky Monastery in Kiev on 25 April [O.S. 13 April] 1900, when she was 61. Galaktionova, A Life in Servitude, p. 53 She was buried within the monastery graveyard in a plain white coffin, wearing her monastic habit. On the day of her burial, Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna attended a memorial service held in the Moscow Kremlin palace church. In the 1950s, Alexandra's remains were moved to the Lukianovskoe Cemetery. She was reburied in the garden at the St. Nicholas Cathedral of the Pokrov Monastery on 2 November 2009. Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna was canonized by the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church on 24 November 2009 as the locally venerated Reverend Grand Duchess Anastasia of Kiev, patron saint of all divorced men and women. Today her grave in the convent garden is again tended by nuns and her works continues.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 43 Titles and styles * 2 June 1838 - 7 January 1856: Her Imperial Highness Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Oldenburg (Princess Alexandra Petrovna Oldenburgskaya) * 7 January 1856 - 25 April 1900: Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Russia, Duchess of Oldenburg ** 3 November 1889 - 25 April 1900: Sister Anastasia Ancestry Notes Bibliography *Beéche, Arturo.

The firm peaked at roughly 600 attorneys in 2006, and had 500 early in 2008, with attorneys with offices in eight cities in the United States, England and China. By the time of its decision to dissolve in late October 2008, it had shrunk to 400 attorneys through layoffs and attrition. Thelen was known for its preeminent construction practice which dates back to the 1930s and the local association between the law firm and contractors and developers of large hydroelectric dam projects. The construction practice offered regulatory, transactional and dispute resolution (litigation and arbitration) support. It was also known for its energy expertise, particularly in the electricity regulatory area, as well as for legal advice concerning technology and outsourcing. History The firm that would become Thelen LLP was founded in 1924 as Thelen, Marrin, Johnson & Bridges (TMJB) in San Francisco, California. The firm counseled contractors and developers in a wide range of big ticket infrastructure projects, including the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge and the second stage of Grand Coulee Dam. United States Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was a TMJB Associate Attorney from 1961 to 1963.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/kennedy.bio.html In June 1998, Thelen Marrin merged with New York-based Reid & Priest, a firm with 160 attorneys founded in 1935 with a Washington, D.C., office, known for its industry experience in the electric utility sector. The combined firm reportedly sought to merge with an English law firm following the revelation that New York-based Rogers & Wells and London-based international firm Clifford Chance were in merger talks that eventually reached fruition. However, the firm did not ultimately engage in a transatlantic merger. Instead, it opted for domestic growth by acquiring the 10 lawyers of San Francisco-based boutique technology firm Britton Silberman & Cervantez in 2000. Three years later, the firm established a joint venture with UK firm Pinsent Masons focused on construction and project finance, called Masons Thelen Reid. The joint venture later launched a link-up with a law firm in Iraq in 2004 to assist firms involved in reconstruction. The joint venture was abandoned in 2007. Thelen Reid & Priest LLP merged, effective on December 1, 2006, with Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner, LLP, to form Thelen Reid Brown Raysman & Steiner LLP. The transaction was the largest law firm merger in 2006, according to the Hildebrandt International consulting firm creating a bicoastal firm of over 600 attorneys with revenues of over $400 million.Hildebrandt International - Hildebrandt International's MergerWatch: Year End 2006 According to the results of the National Law Journal's 2007 survey of the nation's largest law firms, Thelen Reid Brown Raysman & Steiner ranked 70.Law.com - The 2007 NLJ 250 The firm later launched in London and Shanghai. Dissolution Thelen's merger with Brown Raysman created a culture clash on several levels. Thelen had historically been a conservative firm with \\"older and bigger\\" clients, while Brown Raysman was a more \\"entrepreneurial\\" firm that focused on technology and real estate clients. Thelen linked partner compensation to firm performance while Brown Raysman followed a \\"payout\\" model that provided income to capital partners regardless of how the firm performed. Several key partners began to leave the combined firm in early 2007. By autumn 2008, the firm saw the departures of the three \\"name partners\\" from the Brown Raysman Steiner side. The firm shortened its name to Thelen LLP in August 2008.Thelen Their Oats: Will A New Name Lure Suitors? The firm lost almost 200 attorneys between merger and the October 2008 dissolution vote, including many important rainmakers and practice groups, who moved to such leading firms as DLA Piper, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, Proskauer Rose, and Loeb & Loeb. In late September 2008, twenty attorneys in the firm's China practice group in its Washington D.C. and Shanghai offices left for Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. In July 2008, the firm internally announced its intention to seek another merger partner to boost its headcount and stem the tide of partner defections. After merger discussions with East Coast firm Nixon Peabody failed, the firm began looking to shed practice groups and offices under the threat of dissolution. On October 28, 2008, the firm's partnership council recommended that the firm's partnership dissolve the firm. The firm's line of credit was cut off due to many partners departing the firm. In early November, between 60 and 90 attorneys from offices in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Shanghai were reportedly hired by Nixon Peabody. Other practices and groups of attorneys were hired by Howrey LLP, Reed Smith LLP Farella Braun + Martel, and Winston & Strawn, among other firms. The shut-down was completed by the end of 2008. On September 17, 2009, Thelen filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York, after the firm's only secured creditor, Citibank, was also no longer willing to advance funds for the cost of collection and to wind down operations. This subsequently ended the 85-year-old operation that peaked in the year 2006 with offices in a number of cities in the United States, England and China.

He served as a Patrol Officer from 1931 to 1936, and led several expeditions in the early 1930s. Life He was born in Port Moresby, the son of the head gaoler of the Port Moresby Gaol. He received a limited education at schools in Port Moresby and Queensland. He was a good swimmer, sprinter, and amateur boxer. In 1932 he married in Australia and later became the father of two children. His first work in the Papuan public service was in July 1925, and in May 1926 he transferred to a cadet patrol officer. In February 1928 he became a Patrol Officer, and in 1934 became Assistant Resident Magistrate, 2nd grade, serving at various bases until 1936. His work in 1931–1932 leading patrols from Kerema into the partially unexplored Kukukuku country demonstrated considerable leadership skills. In temperament he was bold and courageous, although he has received criticism that some of the loss of life during his missions could have been avoided by more careful planning or caution. He also began to write books about his explorations, mainly based on his diaries, which were successful.  1935 expedition  In 1935 he was chosen by Lieutenant-Governor Hubert Murray to lead an expedition into the unexplored Great Papuan Plateau between the Strickland and Purari Rivers, with Louis James O'Malley as his second-in-command, along with 10 police and 28 carriers. It was the last major exploratory mission in the territory without radio or aerial support. They left Daru, on the south coast, by water on 1 January, followed the Strickland River and then its tributary the Rentoul River by canoe, leaving their boats about five miles below the confluence of the eastern and western branches of the river. From there they continued by foot along the south side of the river, travelling several days without seeing any people or signs of habitation. Then they camped at the confluence of the Sioa and Rentoul river, in view of three longhouses on the opposite side of the valley, and their inhabitants, who seemed to take no notice of the explorers. The next morning, Hides was threatened by a party of natives who had crossed the river in the night. He was able to escape, but continued to meet unfriendly natives, and was forced to fight in total at least nine skirmishes during the patrol, and shot at least 32 tribesmen – often in defence, sometimes due to misinterpretations (see below). He received some criticism for the bloodshed, especially after another patrol was launched in the same area the next year (led by Ivan Champion and C.J. Adamson) with no resulting deaths, but he nonetheless was praised by Hubert Murray, who called his patrol \\"the most difficult and dangerous\\" ever carried out in Papua. When he appeared in Sydney in August, he proved himself an articulate speaker and received considerable attention. The violence which marked his expedition has been attributed to several causes. Hides' group suffered from severe food shortages, and indigenous communities he encountered were often unwilling or unable to trade. Hides had bargained on trading steel tools for food, but found people who were not interested in steel. In addition, the Nembi people were suffering from acute food shortages themselves, and had none to spare. It has been suggested that the Etoro and Onabasulu people \\"did not sell food to the patrol because they feared it and wanted it to go away\\". By necessity, Hides' expedition resorted to stealing food, which led to violence. Another factor was Hides' ignorance of these uncontacted peoples' \\"fragmented political organisation\\", and of the \\"social and political implications of the patrol's movement\\"; he often appeared, from Papuans' perspectives, to be coming from enemy territory, making people instantly wary. Some Papuan peoples greeted the patrol hospitably, however. Among these were the Kewa. By the time the expedition reached Kewa territory, Hides was severely ill, exhausted and famished. \\"His by now exaggerated expectations of native treachery and attack and the desperate condition of the patrol led him to misperceive the Kewa's intent and allowed his patrol to open fire on them on two occasions, resulting in seven or eight Kewa deaths.\\"Schieffelin, Edward and Crittenden, Robert, \\"Remembering First Contact: Realities and Romance\\", in, Borofsky, Robert (ed.), Remembrance of Pacific Pasts: An Invitation to Remake History, Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, , pp.135–141.  Final expedition and death  He had discovered some gold in the upper reaches of the Strickland River, and in 1936 he resigned from the Papuan public service to lead a private gold prospecting expedition up the river in February 1937, with the backing of investors in Sydney. His companion David Lyall became seriously ill on the journey, and they were forced to retreat to the coast, where Lyall died in September. He also lost a number of carriers from beriberi. Depressed by the experience, he returned to Sydney, where he died the following year from pneumonia. Writings Books * Through Wildest Papua. London: Blackie and Son, 1935 * Papuan Wonderland.

He replaced Bishop Joscelin when the latter died during the Siege of Paris on 16 April 886. He and Count Odo led the defences of the city after Joscelin's death. Askericus came from a family prominent in the Île-de- France and in the wars with the Vikings. Askericus was probably related to the Counts of Vermandois. His brother Tetbert, Count of Meaux, was killed fighting the Vikings in 888. Askericus was at the court of Charles the Fat and was present at the 20 May 885 coronation of Charles' as rex in Gallia. He came with Charles' to Paris, probably as bishop-elect, and was installed as bishop by the king in the city in Autumn. In 887, it was he who went to Kirchen to collect the ransom owed the Vikings for relieving their siege. Possible (unproven) relations It may also be possible, while unsourced, that the archbishop of Paris were somehow related to Anscar I of Ivrea, founder of the Anscarids dynasty ruling, in later times and through different branches, in Italy, Burgundy, Galicia, Spain. Anscar's brother was the powerful archbishop of Reims, Fulk (archbishop of Reims). The hypothesis of a family relation is obviously highly speculative, and based only on the names' similarity, on one hand, considering these were often repeated in subsequent generations, and the holding of such high ranks in the church during the same time frame. It should also be noted that Baldwin II of Flanders during the chaotic conflicts for power of time murdered both Fulk of Reims and Herbert I of Vermandois. The latter came from the same family that was likely related to bishop Askericus/Anscharicus. Sources *MacLean, Simon.

Constructed in 1832, it continued to serve the area until 1892, when it was replaced by the Sharkfin Shoal Light. Two years later, the building collapsed, and nothing remains of it. History Since at least 1673, Clay Island had appeared on maps of the Chesapeake Bay area. In that year, it was included on the Augustine Herman map of the Chesapeake, although this map referred to the location as Phillips Point rather than Clay Island, and it was under that name that the location would appear in the novel Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe. Clay Island is at an important nautical location, as it sits where the Nanticoke River and Fishing Bay intersect near the mouth of the Wicomico River on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland. In 1828, land for the construction of a lighthouse was purchased for $600. The light was constructed four years later, in 1832, by John Donahoo, at a total cost of $6,500. The structure he built consisted of a small house with a tower on its roof. This tower eventually enclosed a sixth order Fresnel lens, which displayed a white light above the mean high water mark. By 1882, reports claimed that the structure was beginning to wash away. The Lighthouse Board chose not to repair it, preferring instead to replace it with a more modern light located on Sharkfin Shoal nearby. When the Sharkfin Shoal Light was finally completed in 1892, the Clay Island Light was decommissioned and abandoned. Two years later, the structure collapsed. No remnants of the lighthouse exist.

It is located about 14 km south of the city of Rotterdam, in the municipality of Hoeksche Waard, on the rural Hoeksche Waard island. Map of the former municipality of Maasdam around 1871 Former municipal coat of arms of Maasdam From the 14th Century until around 1800, Maasdam was also the name of the local administrative area, the fief and later the \\"ambacht\\". Subsequently, from 1 January 1812 until 1 January 1984, it became the name of the local municipality, which comprised the village of Maasdam and the surrounding polders. In the periods 1812 - 1817 and 1832 - 1984, the hamlet of Cillaarshoek and the hamlet and polder of Sint Anthoniepolder were also part of the municipality of Maasdam.Gemeentegeschiedenis.nl, \\"Maasdam\\" Hoge Raad van Adel, \\"Gemeente Maasdam\\" The municipality of Maasdam was eventually merged with some surrounding municipalities to become part of the new municipality of Binnenmaas. The exception was Cillaarshoek which was split and partly merged into the existing municipality of Strijen.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten vanaf 1812\\", KNAW, 2nd Ed, 2011. On January 1, 2019 Binnenmaas was merged with Cromstrijen, Korendijk, Oud- Beijerland, and Strijen to form the municipality of Hoeksche Waard.Wet samenvoeging gemeenten Binnenmaas, Cromstrijen, Korendijk, Oud-Beijerland en Strijen, 11 July 2018, accessed at overheid.nl History Maasdam was founded in the 13th Century in an area which at the time was part of the County of Holland, a state within the Holy Roman Empire. Detail of a 20th-century map of the Grote Hollandse Waard, depicting the geography of Maasdam and surrounding area just before the second St. Elizabeth's flood (1421) which submerged most of the land shown. The current village covers areas that were separated by the river Maas until a permanent dam was built around 1270, from which the village took its name. However, archaeological findings have indicated that the area hosted significant human habitations as early as the start of the Roman Flavian dynasty. Excavations in several locations have suggested that there was a large Roman settlement in the Maasdam area (on the northern shore of the river) probably from around 70 AD. Remains have been found of Roman roads, a bridge, a burial field, a harbor complex and even a Roman version of a dam in the river Maas suggesting that it was seen as a location of strategic importance on the North Western border of the Roman Empire.M. Zoeteman, \\"De geschiedenis van de Hoeksche-Waard en Puttershoek\\", accessed online on 03/06/2016 The more permanent foundation of \\"the Maasdam\\" around 1270 created a connection between the areas known as Poelwijk in the Tiesselijnswaard (north of the river) and Weede in the Grote Hollandse Waard (south of the river). The establishment of the Maasdam took place during the reign of Floris V. It was part of the establishment of the Grote Hollandse Waard which in itself was part of the long term policy of land reclamation by the Counts of Holland (since the reign of William I) who saw it as a way to strengthen their political and territorial powers in the region.S.J. Fockema Andreae, \\"Studiën over waterschapsgeschiedenis\\", Brill, 1950\\"Vaders hobby de Hoekse Waard\\", accessed online on 13/05/2015 Maasdam was founded nearby a substantial castle on the banks of the river Maas, the remaining foundations of which were discovered in 1958 in a parcel of land near the road in Maasdam known as \\"Kromme Elleboog\\". For a long time, it was assumed that the ruins in Maasdam were those of the castle Duivestein. However, it has more recently been suggested that the ruins could instead be those of a castle that belonged to the Lords of Weede.Kastelen in Nederland, \\"Duivestein/Weede\\", accessed online on 15/05/2015 The area with castle ruins in Maasdam is officially protected as a Rijksmonument.Rijksmonumenten.nl, \\"Terrein waarin overblijfselen van het kasteel Duyvesteyn in Maasdam\\", accessed online on 15/05/2015 Most of the village of Maasdam and surrounding areas, including the castle, were destroyed during the second St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), although the main dyke in Maasdam as well as the hamlet and polder of Sint Anthoniepolder and hamlet of Cillaarshoek survived. Successful restoration was hindered by further floods as well as the Hook and Cod Wars but eventually Maasdam was restored to its former size soon after Philip the Good allowed his treasurer Jan Nemery, who had been the vassal of Maasdam for almost two decades, in 1435 to reclaim the polders next to the surviving dyke in Maasdam from the sea.P.O. van der Chijs, \\"De munten der voormalige Graafschappen Holland en Zeeland (etc.): 26,6\\", F.Bohn, 1858 Martine's Historische Homepage, \\"Maasdam\\", accessed online on 14/05/2015 Former vassals of Maasdam * Jan Nemery, 1416 - 1438 * Jacob Nemery, 1438 - 1497 * Jacob Heerman, 1497 -1505 * Gijsbrecht Heerman, 1505 - 1541 * Boudewijn Heerman, 1541 - 1578 * Pieternella van Hooghlande, 1578 * Jonkheer Arent van Dorp, 1578 - 1600 * Anna van Dorp, 1600 * Philips van den Bossche, 1600 - 1612 * Jacques Manrycque, 1612 - 1615 * Anthonie Manrycque, 1615 - 1653 * Frederik van Dorp, 1653 -1700 * Carel Filips van Dorp, 1700 - 1726 * Anna Maria van Dorp, 1726 - 1738 * Adam Filips van der Duin, 1738 - 1739 * Arnold Joost van der Duin, 1739 - 1793 * Adam François Maximiliaan van der Duyn, 1793 - 1814 * Frans Adam Jules Armand van der Duyn van Maasdam, 1814 -1848 The last vasal of Maasdam, Frans Adam van der Duyn van Maasdam (1771 -1848), was one of the three noblemen who briefly formed the provisional government of the Netherlands after its liberation from Napoleonic France by Prussian and Russian troops in 1813.

He is considered to be one of the finest and most complete folk singers of his generation. Biography Early life and career beginnings Brkan was born into a Bosniak family in Mostar, while Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of Yugoslavia. His father was Ibro and his mother was Bisera. He grew up in the countryside with cousins, as his mother was working. After their financial situation improved, they moved to the center of the city and Brkan finished electrical engineering school. During his teens he sang at a folklore club in Mostar and by his late teens he had performed several times at the hotel (Rose), next to the Neretva river. He also later performed sevdalinka and old folk songs at various restaurants around the city. A few years later he was noticed and signed by the record label Jugoton. While living in Belgrade, a hairdresser offered him a job as a model, he accepted, but kept the job for only few months. Career At the start of his career in the 1970s, he signed a contract with the record label Jugoton, seeded in Zagreb. At his peak, he was one of the biggest stars in Yugoslavia – selling millions of copies and receiving recognition from public and critics as well. After signing a record contract with PGP-RTB, a major and high-rated music production company in Yugoslavia, Brkan moved to Belgrade and lived in a hotel for six months. In 1976, he released his first single \\"Tvoje oči garave\\" (Your Dark Eyes), composed by well respected author Mijat Božović. It was followed by the singles \\"Ne ruši mi sreću, nepoznata ženo!\\" (Do Not Crush My Love, Unknown Woman, 1978) and \\"Jednom sam i ja volio\\" (I, Too, Once Loved, July 1979), both composed by Aca Stepić. In the 1980s, he partnered with a different composer, Ljubo Kešelj and released a hit album \\"Najljepšu haljinu večeras obuci\\" (Wear the Most Beautiful Dress Tonight, 1982.) Throughout the 80s, he performed at various festivals and held concerts all over Yugoslavia. At the early stage of the Yugoslav Wars he left Belgrade and went with his family to the Netherlands, and later Germany. As a result of the Yugoslav wars, the state collapsed and a new music genre, called \\"Turbo-folk\\" started domination in social and cultural life. As honest and humble man, Brkan could not accept \\"life in a jungle\\" and low-profile music. Although the war had not yet finished, because of his patriotism, he returned to Bosnia in 1994. After few efforts to come back, he eventually retired from his professional career in 1996, at the age of 42. However, he will always be remembered as great singer with unique, subtle and lyrical voice. Beside songs composed for his studio albums, he will also be remembered as outstanding performer of Bosnian traditional song - Sevdalinka. Some of his interpretations are inducted in National Music Register. He recorded songs for Bosnian and Serbian radio and TV archive, written and composed by Sevdah legends. Brkan has also performed at many prominent music festivals (in Sarajevo, Belgrade, Novi Sad, Skopje), traditionally receiving awards for interpretation. In 2009, three decades after his first and biggest hit song \\"Jednom sam i ja volio\\", Brkan made a comeback. His original record label, PGP-RTS (previously known as PGP-RTB), published a CD with his songs from 1976 to 1990. In the same year, he recorded series of sevdalinka songs for MP BHRT (Bosnian radio and television music production.) His version of \\"Mujo kuje konja pod mjesecu\\" (Mujo Shoes the Horse Below the Moonlight) was inducted into the National Music Register just five days after recording. A few weeks after the CD was published, in a television show, Brkan made his first live performance after a more than decade-long hiatus. Personal life After marrying a woman from Tuzla named Azra, the newlyweds moved into a new apartment in Belgrade and later had a son together. When the wars in Yugoslavia broke out in the early 1990s, he moved his family from Belgrade to a friends home in the Netherlands. During this time, he did not sing until his friend Halid Muslimović invited him to Germany. Brkan returned to his war-torn home-country of Bosnia in 1994, where he stayed for the remainder of the war and currently still lives there. He has two sons Omar (born 1989) and Emel (born 1996) Discography Singles *Tvoje oči garave (1976) *Ne ruši mi sreću, nepoznata ženo! / Željela si dva prstena (1978) *Jednom sam i ja volio / Dvije mladosti za ljubav smo dali (1979) *Da si sretna pisala mi ne bi / Ljubavi vladaju svijetom (1980) Studio albums *Voli me, grli me (1981) *Najlijepšu haljinu večeras obuci (1982) *Majko, prijatelju moj (1984) *Ema (1985) *Još me ima!

In practice, Törnqvist index values are calculated for consecutive periods, then these are strung together, or \\"chained\\". Thus, the core calculation does not refer to a single base year.  Computation  The price index for some period is usually normalized to be 1 or 100, and that period is called \\"base period.\\" A Törnqvist or Törnqvist-Theil price index is the weighted geometric mean of the price relatives using arithmetic averages of the value shares in the two periods as weights.Glossary, OECD The data used are prices and quantities in two time-periods, (t-1) and (t), for each of n goods which are indexed by i. If we denote the price of item i at time t-1 by p_{i,t-1}, and, analogously, we define q_{i,t} to be the quantity purchased of item i at time t, then, the Törnqvist price index P_t at time t can be calculated as follows:“Törnqvist Index and other Log-change Index Numbers” , Statistics New Zealand: Glossary of Common Terms. :\\\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,t-1}}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[\\\\frac{p_{i,t-1}q_{i,t-1}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\left(p_{j,t-1}q_{j,t-1}\\\\right)}+ \\\\frac{p_{i,t}q_{i,t}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\left(p_{j,t}q_{j,t}\\\\right)}\\\\right]} The denominators in the exponent are the sums of total expenditure in each of the two periods. This can be expressed more compactly in vector notation. Let p_{t-1} denote the vector of all prices at time t-1 and analogously define vectors q_{t-1}, p_t, and q_t. Then the above expression can be rewritten: :\\\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_{it}}{p_{i,t-1}}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[\\\\frac{p_{i,t-1}q_{i,t-1}}{p_{t-1} \\\\cdot q_{t-1}} + \\\\frac{p_{i,t}q_{i,t}}{p_{t} \\\\cdot q_{t}}\\\\right]} In this second expression, notice that the overall exponent is the average share of expenditure on good i across the two periods. The Törnqvist index weighs the experiences in the two periods equally, so it is said to be a symmetric index. Usually, that share doesn't change much; e.g. food expenditures across a million households might be 20% of income in one period and 20.1% the next period. In practice, Törnqvist indexes are often computed using an equation that results from taking logs of both sides, as in the expression below which computes the same P_t as those above.Glossary. IMF Producer Price Index manual p. 610 :ln \\\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\left (\\\\frac {p_{i,t-1}q_{i,t-1}}{p_{t-1}q_{t-1}} + \\\\frac {p_{i,t}q_{i,t}}{p_tq_t} \\\\right) ln\\\\left (\\\\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,t-1}} \\\\right) A Törnqvist quantity index can be calculated analogously using prices for weights. Quantity indexes are used in computing aggregate indexes for physical \\"capital\\" summarizing equipment and structures of different types into one time series. Swapping p's for q's and q's for p's gives an equation for a quantity index: :\\\\frac{Q_t}{Q_{t-1}} = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{q_{i,t}}{q_{i,t-1}}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[\\\\frac{p_{i,t-1}q_{i,t-1}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\left(p_{j,t-1}q_{j,t-1}\\\\right)}+ \\\\frac{p_{i,t}q_{i,t}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\left(p_{j,t}q_{j,t}\\\\right)}\\\\right]} If one needs matched quantity and price indexes they can be calculated directly from these equations, but it is more common to compute a price index by dividing total expenditure each period by the quantity index so the resulting indexes multiply out to total expenditure. This approach is called the indirect way of calculating a Törnqvist index, and it generates numbers that are not exactly the same as a direct calculation. There is research on which method to use based partly on whether price changes or quantity changes are more volatile.Allen, Robert C.; W. Erwin Diewert. 1981. Direct versus Implicit Superlative Index Number Formulae. The Review of Economics and Statistics, 63:3 (Aug., 1981), 430-435. (on jstor) For multifactor productivity calculations, the indirect method is used. Törnqvist indexes are close to the figures given by the Fisher index.Diewert, W. E. 1978. \\"Superlative Index Numbers and Consistency in Aggregation\\", Econometrica, 46(4): 883-900.Dumagan, Jesus Castanos. 2002. \\"Comparing the superlative Törnqvist and Fisher ideal indexes\\", Economics Letters 76:2, 251-258. The Fisher index is sometimes preferred in practice because it handles zero-quantities without special exceptions, whereas in the equations above a quantity of zero would make the Törnqvist index calculation break down.  Theory  A Törnqvist index is a discrete approximation to a continuous Divisia index. A Divisia index is a theoretical construct, a continuous-time weighted sum of the growth rates of the various components, where the weights are the component's shares in total value. For a Törnqvist index, the growth rates are defined to be the difference in natural logarithms of successive observations of the components (i.e. their log-change) and the weights are equal to the mean of the factor shares of the components in the corresponding pair of periods (usually years). Divisia-type indexes have advantages over constant-base-year weighted indexes, because as relative prices of inputs change, they incorporate changes both in quantities purchased and relative prices. For example, a Törnqvist index summarizing labor input may weigh the growth rate of the hours of each group of workers by the share of labor compensation they receive.Multifactor productivity data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics The Törnqvist index is a superlative index, meaning it can approximate any smooth production or cost function. \\"Smooth\\" here means that small changes in relative prices for a good will be associated with small changes in the quantity of it used. The Törnqvist corresponds exactly to the translog production function, meaning that given a change in prices and an optimal response in quantities, the level of the index will change exactly as much as the change in production or utility would be. To express that thought, Diewert (1978) uses this phrasing which other economists now recognize: the Törnqvist index procedure \\"is exact for\\" the translog production or utility function. For this reason, the term translog index is sometimes used for a Törnqvist index. The Törnqvist index is approximately \\"consistent in aggregation\\", meaning that the almost exactly the same index values result from (a) combining many prices and quantities together, or (b) combining subgroups of them together then combining those indexes. For some purposes (like large annual aggregates), this is treated as consistent enough, and for others (like monthly price changes) it is not.  History and use  The Törnqvist index theory is attributed to Leo Törnqvist (1936), perhaps working with others at the Bank of Finland.Törnqvist, Leo. 1936. \\"The Bank of Finland's Consumption Price Index\\", Bank of Finland Monthly Bulletin 10, 1-8.Törnqvist, Leo. 1981.

He was formerly an editor with the international journal of science Nature, and the popular science magazine New Scientist. He has been a guest columnist for the New York Times, and currently writes a monthly column for the journal Nature Physics. Buchanan's books and articles typically explore ideas of modern physics, especially in quantum theory or condensed matter physics, with an emphasis on efforts to use novel concepts from physics to understand patterns and dynamics elsewhere, especially in biology or in the human social sciences. Key themes include, but are not limited to the (often overlooked) importance of spontaneous order or self-organization in collective, complex systems. All of his work aims to bring technical advances in modern science to a broad, non-technical audience, and to help stimulate the flow of ideas across disciplinary boundaries. He has been awarded, in June 2009, the Lagrange Prize in Turin, regarding science writing in the field of complexity.

Virtual disks and virtual drives are common components of virtual machines in hardware virtualization, but they are also widely used for various purposes unrelated to virtualization, such as for the creation of logical disks. Operation A virtual drive is a software component that emulates an actual disk drive, such as an optical disc drive, a floppy disk drive, or a hard disk drive. To other programs, a virtual drive looks and behaves like an actual physical device. A virtual disk may be in any of the following forms: * Disk image, a computer file that contains the exact data structure of an actual storage device * Logical disk (also known as vdisk), an array of two or more actual drives that cooperatively act like a single device * RAM disk, which stores its data in random-access memory (RAM) instead of on a storage device * A mapped network drive that connects to a File Server Uses In hardware virtualization, virtual machines implement virtual drives as part of their efforts to emulate the behavior of an actual machine. As with an ordinary computer, a virtual machine needs one virtual drive and one disk image to start up, except when it is performing a network boot. More virtual drives are added as needed. Virtual optical drives are used on physical computers to transfer the contents of the optical disks onto hard disk drives. Doing so helps in resolving the problem of the short life span of CDs and DVDs and takes advantage of the faster data transfer rate of hard disk drives. However, virtual optical drives are also used for software piracy: early computer games used disc existence verification to ensure licensed use, which can be circumvented using virtual optical drives. As a countermeasure, the StarForce copy protection scheme attempts to thwart disc virtualization. Modern video games have migrated to online product activation as part of their distribution process.

Traditional economic theory counters this by contending that employment created in the growing service sector can absorb labour displaced in manufacturing. But this is by no means a smooth process since extensive retraining may be required before labour can be transferred to entirely new areas of activity.

Stjernquist began his career as a local judge and court official. He became a doctoral student of the celebrated 'realist' jurist Karl Olivecrona in the 1940s but, as a left-leaning liberal, soon fell out with his supervisor over Olivecrona's authoritarian politics and vocal support in the war years for Nazi Germany's hegemony in Europe. He was professor of civil law at Lund University from 1950 to 1972 and rector of the university through the turbulent years of the late 1960s. His publications set the dominant orientation of Swedish sociology of law, and he supervised generations of research students in the subject. His first seminar in sociology of law (established against determined opposition from the Law Faculty) was taught in 1963. The subject, then regarded by many jurists as subversive or unnecessary, was offered initially for administrative science students but soon attracted students from many disciplines. The Chair of Sociology of Law at Lund was created specially for him in 1972, as an initiative of the Swedish government. Stjernquist's work included important empirical studies of the legal mechanisms and policies of regulation of Swedish private forestry, which attempted to show the range of strategies by which law could influence social behaviour, as well as the constraints on law as a social mechanism. He was the son of professor and university rector Martin P:son Nilsson and Hanna Stjernquist. His wife was the archaeologist Berta Stjernquist (1918-2010), also a professor at Lund. Stjernquist was Inspector of the Kalmar 'nation' at his university from 1954–1996. Bibliography *Per Stjernquist, Laws in the Forests: A Study of Public Direction of Swedish Private Forestry.

It was broken off the larger March of Carinthia, itself a march of the Duchy of Bavaria, around 970 as a buffer zone against the Hungarian invasions.Thompson, 600. Under the overlordship of the Carinthian dukes from 976 onwards, the territory evolved to be called Styria, so named for the town of Steyr, then the residence of the Otakar margraves. It became an Imperial State in its own right, when the Otakars were elevated to Dukes of Styria in 1180. History After the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps from about 590 and the establishment of the Carantanian principality in the 7th century, the area had fallen under Bavarian suzerainty, when about 740 Prince Boruth asked Duke Odilo for help against invading Avar forces. Incorporated into the Carolingian Empire by Charlemagne, Frankish manoralism was introduced and the northwestern areas were resettled by Bavarian peasants. The population was Christianized by the Archbishops of Salzburg. However, large parts of former Carantania were again lost during the invasion of Hungarian troops culminating in the East Frankish defeat in the 907 Battle of Pressburg. King Otto I of Germany ended the Hungarian invasions in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. In the aftermath, the former Carantanian lands were reconquered up to the Lafnitz River in the east. When in 976 King Otto II separated the Duchy of Carinthia from the Bavarian stem duchy, it included the marches of Verona, Istria, Carniola, and the marchia Carantana (Styria), comprising the adjacent eastern territory beyond the Koralpe range on to the Mur, Mürz and Enns rivers. In 1042/43 further territory east of the Mur up to Pitten and the Leitha river was conquered by King Henry III of Germany, who finally defeated the Hungarian forces in the 1044 Battle of Ménfő. The Carantanian lands were largely settled by Germans and Christianized by the Archbishops of Salzburg. In 1004 the Bavarian count palatines of the Aribonid dynasty founded the Benedictine nunnery of Göss, which was elevated to an Imperial abbey by Emperor Henry II in 1020. Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg established Admont Abbey in 1074, and St. Lambrecht's Abbey was founded as a proprietary monastery of the noble House of Eppenstein two years later. Further cloister foundations included the Cistercian abbey of Rein in 1129, Seckau Abbey in 1140, Spital am Semmering in 1160, the Augustinian monastery of Vorau in 1163, and the charterhouse of Seitz (Žiče) in 1164. The first margraves from the House of Eppenstein appear in the late 10th century. Margrave Adalbero also was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Carinthia in 1011/12, however was deposed for alleged high treason by Emperor Conrad II in 1035. In 1053/54 the margravial lands were pillaged by the forces of the deposed Bavarian duke Conrad I and Duke Welf of Carinthia. From 1056 onwards, the march was ruled by the Chiemgau count Ottokar I and his descendants of the Otakar dynasty, who were first mentioned as \\"Margraves of Steyr\\" in 1074. In 1122 they also inherited the allodial possessions of their Eppenstein predecessors in Upper Styria. Once the political turmoils of the fierce Investiture Controversy had ended, Margrave Leopold the Strong (1122–1129) and his son Ottokar III (1129–1164) gradually gained independence from the Carinthian dukes and were able to acquire large territories along the Savinja river down to the Windic March. Leopold had the town and castle of Hartberg laid out; Margrave Ottokar III extended his influence down the Mur river into the Mark an der Sann territory (Lower Styria) and moved his residence to Graz, he already began to call himself princeps. In 1180 his son and successor Margrave Ottokar IV finally was elevated to a Duke of Styria by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. However, Ottokar IV was also the last Otakar duke. The line became extinct upon his death in 1192, whereafter the Styrian lands were inherited by the Babenberg dukes of Austria according to the 1186 Georgenberg Pact.

This manuscript however had been written by Patrick Young following a copy made by John Geddie. James apologised that the language of this copy had been corrupted first by the version of Scots used by Geddie, and then by Patrick Young's attempts to convert the text into English spelling. He joked that the result was like the Welsh spoken by the courtier Roger Aston, who was from Cheshire.Sebastiaan Verweij, The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland: Manuscript Production and Transmission (Oxford, 2016), pp. 56-8.

It is one of six native Japanese cattle breeds, and one of the four Japanese breeds known as wagyū, the others being the Japanese Black, the Japanese Polled and the Japanese Shorthorn. All wagyū cattle derive from cross-breeding in the early twentieth century of native Japanese cattle with imported stock, mostly from Europe. In the case of the Japanese Brown, the principal foreign influence was from the Korean Hanwoo and Swiss Simmental breeds.  Etymology  The Kanji characters literally mean \\"red cow.\\"  History  Cattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser. Milk consumption was unknown, and – for cultural and religious reasons – meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy. Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported. At first there was little interest in cross-breeding these with native stock, but from about 1900 it became widespread. It ceased abruptly in 1910, when it was realised that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as \\"Improved Japanese Cattle\\". Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagyū breeds, the Japanese Brown, the Japanese Black, the Japanese Polled and the Japanese Shorthorn. The Japanese Brown developed in southern Japan, in Kōchi Prefecture on Shikoku island, and in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu island. The principal foreign influences on the breed were from the British Devon, Korean Hanwoo and Swiss Simmental cattle breeds. In 1960 the total breed population was reported to be over . In 1978 it was reported as , and in 2008 it was . The Japanese Brown constitutes about 4.8% of the national beef herd.

A pastor search committee was formed, and steps were taken to find a replacement for Wayne Smith. However, after Smith announced his retirement and in the midst of the search, Mike Breaux, pastor of Canyon Ridge Christian Church in Las Vegas, Nevada, was invited to preach one weekend. Soon after that weekend, the pastor search committee suspended the search process and hired Mike Breaux as Senior Pastor. He then became the church's second senior pastor. During his tenure the church grew to an attendance of more than 7,000 persons a week. Jon Weece joined Southland as a teaching pastor in 2000, sharing in the responsibilities of a church with six weekend services. After a building program that reduced the weekend services from six to five, Breaux moved to Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, in 2003. In 2009, Mike Breaux became and is currently still a teaching pastor at Heartland Community Church in Rockford IL. He also serves on the churches Leadership Team. Weece, a former missionary to Haiti, became the third senior pastor on September 1, 2003. Still in his twenties at the time, he was one of the youngest megachurch senior pastors in the United States. Under Weece's leadership, the Southland services have grown to an attendance of over 12,000 each weekend. In 2009, Southland opened its first satellite campus in Danville, KY. An additional satellite campus is planned for the former Lexington Mall site on Richmond Road in Lexington. In 2010, Southland purchased the former Lexington Mall to begin construction on a new \\"Richmond Road\\" campus. The campus opened in January 2013. In 2015, Southland began holding services in Georgetown, KY at Lemons Mill Elementary. In 2018, Southland announced a launch of a new campus in Richmond, KY in early 2020. Beliefs As a Restoration Movement church, Southland's beliefs are similar to other churches' in the movement, although local congregations are independent and may vary slightly from each other. Southland members include a large number of people with roots in denominations outside the Restoration Movement, including a significant number from Baptist and Wesleyan/Methodist traditions among others. As such, the church also has strong influences from, and often even identifies itself with, Protestantism. In short, the following is a summary of what Christians who are members of Southland are asked to believe: * Jesus Christ is the one and only Son of God, who died for our sins and arose from the dead. * The Bible is the inspired word of God. * Every person has worth as a creation of God, but that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. * Forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life are available to those who trust Christ as Savior and Lord. * Those accepting Christ should repent of sin, confess their faith, and be baptized into Him. This implies that salvation is not received by doing one of the above but all of the above. * The Church is the body of Christ on earth, empowered by the Holy Spirit and exists to evangelize the lost and edify the saved. * Jesus Christ will one day return to earth and reign forever as King of kings and Lord of lords. In early 2010, Southland had a message series titled \\"DNA of a Dangerous Church.\\" During this series, Jon Weece, lead follower, announced Southland's mission to \\"unleash a revolution of love.\\" This main description was followed by four expressions that should define \\"the church\\". 1\\\\. We relentlessly pursue a transforming relationship with God. 2\\\\. We sacrificially serve our families. 3\\\\. We radically invest in the next generation. 4\\\\. We generously extend hope to the poor. Southland has not yet clarified its position of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit Worship services While the worship music is live at each campus, the teaching is usually live at the Nicholasville campus in Nicholasville, Kentucky and then streamed live to the Lexington, Danville, and Georgetown campuses. Because of this, all campuses are able to have the same teaching schedule and same service times. Currently, all four campuses have Sunday morning services at 9:30 am, and 11:15 am. In addition, the Nicholasville campus has a 9:40 am service in a smaller video venue with café-style seating and the Lexington campus has a 6:00 pm evening service in which there is a live teaching. All services are contemporary in style and casual in dress. Southlandonline.tv Southland's services can be viewed online 12 times per week at SouthlandOnline.tv and at 10:00 am each Sunday on ABC 36 which broadcasts throughout the East Central Kentucky Region.

Description Clover mites are long, oval shaped arachnids with a pair of long legs pointing forward often mistaken for antennae. They are reddish brown; the younger ones and the eggs are a bright red. They are extremely common in late spring in North America. Ecology Clover mites are polyphagous, feeding on a wide range of plants, including \\"lawn grasses, ornamental flowers, clover, dandelion, shepherd's purse, strawberry, daffodil, Salvia, Alyssum, and primrose\\". They are especially numerous in lawns with a heavy growth of succulent, well-fertilized grass. They do not cause any apparent harm to turf grass, but their feeding activity can turn the grass a silvery color and may stipple plants when heavy populations are present. Clover mites reproduce parthenogenetically, their eggs do not need to be fertilized and are entirely female. Females lay about 70 eggs each. They generally enter houses close to thick vegetation and can infiltrate houses in very large numbers through cracks and small openings around windows and doors. Whether indoors or outside, clover mites are found more commonly in sunny areas than in darker areas. If squashed, they leave a characteristic red stain caused by their pigmentation. Clover mites are not harmful to humans, pets, or furniture.

They hailed from the same scene as bands such as Lucky Boys Confusion and The Plain White T's.  History  The band was started by Dan Monahan and Augie Schmidt. The two recorded the band's first album, Bandshell with producer Jeff Murphy, formerly of The Shoes fame. The album sold nearly 10,000 copies and the single, \\"Hey Luv\\" maintained steady radio play for several months in Chicago and other US markets.The Dog And Everything, Chicagomusicguidecom.

After the album was out, they added drummer Shawn Davis to the band, and several months later, Jimmy Dietzen was brought in for guitar and backup vocals. In October 2002, the group was named \\"Chicago's Best Unsigned Band\\" in a radio contest sponsored by WZZN; \\"Hey Luv\\" became one of the station's most popular tunes in the fall and winter of 2002. The group toured for 2 years to support Bandshell, touring with Something Corporate, Riddlin' Kids and Lucky Boys Confusion across the US, and headlining multiple sold-out shows in major alternative venues in the Chicago area.

Price (March 17, 1916 - November 6, 1998) is an American architect who has been called \\"Galveston's foremost modern architect\\" by historian and Rice University faculty member Stephen Fox, an Adjunct Lecturer of the School of Architecture. Price's portfolio of designs encompass a diverse variety of building types. Almost all of the buildings that were built from his designs are located in southeastern United States. Early life and education Price was born in Blacksburg, Virginia on March 17, 1916. Price attended the Virginia Polytechnic Institute until he received his bachelor's degree in 1938.Virginia Tech Magazine Class Notes He received his master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1941. While at Harvard he studied under modern masters like Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius. Career Galveston Price was primarily active from the 1950s to the late 1970s, designing private residences, hotels, motels, schools, a social club, a beach house and commercial buildings. His preference for trimly-detailed buildings with walls treated as planes of glass or solidly paneled surfaces is evident in many of the buildings he designed in Galveston. These include the Seahorse Motel (1956, now demolished) and the Beachcomber Motel (1963) on Seawall Boulevard, the Galveston Artillery Club (1959) on Avenue O, the gymnasium of Gladneo Parker Elementary School (1960) on 69th Street, and his largest project that he worked on in the city, the 10-story Sealy & Smith Professional Building (1964, demolished in 2007) on University Boulevard. Price designed several of the most distinctive modern houses built in Galveston, among them the Caravageli House (1954) on Caduceus Place, the Stirling House on South Shore Drive (1956), the Mehos House on Harbor View Drive (1958), the Yen House on Marine Drive (1959), and the Kelso Camp on Offatts Bayou (1963). Price was involved in early efforts to preserve Galveston's 19th-century architectural heritage. He was responsible for two pioneer preservation planning studies prepared for the city: Galveston, Texas: Historical District Guide (1970) and Historical Development Plan for Galveston, Texas (1973). Other cities Outside Galveston, Price designed the Lasher House (1956) in the Memorial section of Houston, Texas which has been renovated and restored by Ray Bailey architects and the Bauer House outside Port Lavaca, Texas (1958). Including Houston, he designed banks in Alvin, Bay City, Freeport, Hitchcock, and Webster, Texas in the 1960s. He also designed hotels in Asheville, North Carolina, Biloxi, Mississippi, Marathon, Florida and San Francisco, California (most affiliated with the Jack Tar chain) around the same time. Retirement and death Thomas M. Price retired to 320 W. Burbank St. in Fredericksburg, Texas where he designed the Nimitz Museum. He died on November 6, 1998 at the age of 82. Price's house designs are among the most distinctive in Galveston, and are listed in the Galveston Architectural Guide.

In Slovenian historiography, it is known as Slovene March ( or Slovenska krajina). Etymology The name Windic is derived from Wends (), the name for Western Slavs settling in the Germania Slavica contact zone. The medieval German term ' referred to the Slovene language, but also to Slavic languages in general. It has the same etymology as ', the historic German term for the Sorbian- speaking population in Lusatia. In the 6th and 7th century the term was used by Bavarian settlers to refer to the Slavic population in the East Alpine principality of Carantania. The medieval geographic term ' referred also to the region of Slavonia. In this usage, March is defined as a frontier or border area between two countries or territories. History Earliest mentions The Chronicle of Fredegar mentions \\"Sclavos coinomento Winedorum\\" in 623. Samo's tribal union included the Windic March (Marca Vinedorum) of Duke Valuk (Wallucus Dux), located in the Eastern Alps, in 631. 8th–10th century The territory of the Windic march was contained within the larger March of Carniola in Carolingian times, but under King Otto I of Germany from about 960 on it was separated from Upper Carniola (Gorenjska) and integrated into the March of Savinja (or Soune). In 976 it was attached to the newly founded Duchy of Carinthia. 11th–12th century After Margrave William of Soune had been killed by the deposed Carinthian duke Adalbero in 1036, the Windic march was separated from Carinthia and reattached to the newly established March of Carniola, which was thereafter sometimes called \\"Carniola and the Windic March\\". In 1077 King Henry IV of Germany put Carniola and the Windic March under the direction of the Patriarch of Aquileia. From 1127 to 1131 the margravial territory was further expanded in several campaigns by the Counts of Weichselburg (or Weichselberg, modern Višnja Gora) against Croatia in the union with Hungary. Backed by the Archbishop of Salzburg, they conquered the territory around Metlika up to the Kolpa River in the southeast, the later White Carniola (Bela krajina) region. 13th century Until 1209 the Counts of Weichselburg held extended possessions in the Windic March. Through a marriage to the last heiress Sophia of Weichselburg, the Counts of Andechs, then at the peak of their power as Margraves of Istria and Dukes of Merania came to dominate the territory. It was part of the dowry of Agnes of Merania, daughter of Duke Otto I of Andechs-Merania, upon her marriage with the Frederick II of Babenberg, son of Duke Leopold VI of Austria, in 1229. Frederick II thereafter called himself a dominus Carniole (Lord of Carniola) and succeeded his father as Duke of Austria and Styria in the following year. In 1248 the title was picked up by Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia, who had married Agnes of Merania after Frederick's death in 1246. When Duke Ulrich died in 1269, King Ottokar II of Bohemia occupied and unified Carniola, the Windic March, the valley of the Savinja, and the Slovenj Gradec as \\"the march\\" of his vast kingdom extending from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic. After 1282, despite King Rudolf I's grant to his sons, Carniola and the Windic march were united under the control of the Meinhardiner duke Meinhard of Carinthia. During this period, the entity became known as the County in the March and Möttlig (Metlika). After 1374, the Windic March fell to the House of Habsburg. The Habsburgs however soon pawned it to the Counts of Cilli who remained the de facto rulers of the territory until their extinction in 1456. The Habsburgs retook the Windic March together with all other Cilli possessions in the Holy Roman Empire. They immediately reunited it with Carniola, and the Windic March thus ceased to be a separate political entity. The head of the House of Habsburg continued carrying the title of \\"Lord on the Windic March\\" in the grand title of the Emperor of Austria.

He currently splits his time living and working in both Paris, France and Bandjoun, Cameroon. He works in a variety of media aside from visual and performing arts including photographs, prints, sculptures, videos, and installations.  Biography  Toguo studied at the National school of Fine Arts in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, at the École supérieure d'Art de Grenoble, France and at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, Germany. Some of his paintings are found in The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi. Starting in 2005 and continuing until completion in 2007, he constructed a cultural project called the Bandjoun Station. It is an art center located in his native Cameroon that includes an exhibition space, a library, an artist residency, and an organic farm. It was made to foster contemporary art and culture within the local community. The station is composed of two distinct buildings divided into different centers that are used for multiple individual purposes. The main building is designed with five armed concrete pillars and topped with a ten meter high gable; this sloped roof respects the traditional architecture or the area.Barthélémy Toguo (artist) (2008) Head Above Water, Bandjoun Station, and the Venice Biennale, Critical Interventions, 2:1-2, 26-30, DOI: 10.1080/19301944.2008.10781328 The station is in a location that welcomes all sorts of traditions. People are invited to appropriate this space, to organize festivals for or related to their culture such as burials, births, and even weddings. It is all done in hopes to create social cohesion within the community. In 2011, Toguo was made a Knight of the Order of Arts and LiteratureStevenson. “Barthélémy Toguo: Biography.” STEVENSON, www.stevenson.info/artist/barthelemy-toguo/biography. in France for his ongoing engagement and creativity, helping to develop the arts and culture in France and throughout the world, and building bridges between nations with his art. Later in 2016, Toguo was shortlisted for the Prix Marcel Duchamp, France's most high-profile art award. He was awarded a 2018 Inga Maren Otto Fellowship by The Watermill Center in Long Island, New York. During his residency over the summer in 2018, he created some of the works for his exhibition The Beauty of Our Voice, presented at the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill, New York, from August 5, 2018 to October 14, 2018. His first solo exhibition at an American museum, The Beauty of Our Voice expanded his gaze to the U.S. with new watercolor paintings, installations, photography, performance, and a community art project. Artwork The Road to Exile is the centerpiece to The Beauty of Our Voice series. The monumental installation addresses the migrant and refugee crisis, the desire of young Africans to escape and specifically the desire of young Africans to escape in hopes for a better life. 262x262px Toguo is a multiple disciplinary artist whose work addresses migration, colonialism, race, exile and displacement. He started off reproducing classic European sculpture until 1992 where he took up woodcarving. At Grenoble he discovered photography and video and experiments with German realism. Later at Dusseldorf, he becomes interested in performance art and in 1996 Toguo performs his Transit series. In the late 1990s he began his exploration with watercolor. These watercolors were inspired by his travels and experiences and then evolved even more when he discovered his fascination with passports and their stamps. The passport had the ability to document an individual's travels across borders. This small book contains a variety of stamps that became a visual mark of the policing of humans. This concept of belonging stems from his dual citizenship in both Cameroon and France. His work has also been informed by the social movements including Black Lives Matter seen in his Black Lives Always Matter series and the refugee crisis seen in The Beauty of Our Voice work. Aside from the stamps found within passports Barthelemy Toguo is also inspired by post cards. This can be seen within his work in the Head Above Water series. He traveled around the world collecting these cards in order to give the people a voice. He questioned people about their life conditions, current events, wars, and about their hopes and dreams. Toguo would go to these locations including schools, streets, and marketplaces and would gather the answers to his questions. Later, he would go to a local post office and create a postcard and address it to himself. He would not actually mail them but would rather keep them and carry them around with him on his trips. Exhibitions Toguo’s work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musée d’art contemporain, Lyon; Fondation Louis Vuitton; and Kunstsammlungen der Stadt, Düsseldorf, among others. Solo exhibitions of his work have been presented at institutions including Uppsala Art Museum, Sweden; Musée d’art moderne et contemporain de Saint-Etienne, France; La Verrière by Hermès, Brussels; Fundaçao Gulbenkian, Lisbon; and Palais de Tokyo, Paris. Barthelemy Toguo has declined participation in exhibitions because of political views. Such as the time in 2007 when he declined the invitation to join the Venice Biennale. He states, “What guides me is a constantly evolving aesthetic but also a sense of ethics which makes a difference and structures my entire approach. With my private initiative, Bandjoun Station in Cameroon, and the artistic project that accompanies it, I wanted to take on my responsibilities as a man and an artist by offering another model and reference. Under no circumstances whatever should my name be associated with that of Sindika Dokolo or the collection that he has put together over the years.\\" He continues to say that he respects all the other artists that are participating in the project though he will not be joining them.

It was a part of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806 and a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria–Hungary until its dissolution in 1918. History It was created by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1180 when he raised the March of Styria to a duchy of equal rank with neighbouring Carinthia and Bavaria, after the fall of the Bavarian duke Henry the Lion earlier that year. Margrave Ottokar IV thereby became the first Duke of Styria and also the last of the ancient Otakar dynasty. As Ottokar had no issue, he in 1186 signed the Georgenberg Pact with the mighty House of Babenberg, rulers of Austria since 976, after which both duchies should in perpetuity be ruled in personal union. Upon his death in 1192, Styria as stipulated fell to the Babenberg duke Leopold V of Austria. Grazer Schlossberg The Austrian Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Duke Frederick II the Quarrelsome was killed in battle against King Béla IV of Hungary. Styria, actually a ceased Imperial fief, became a matter of dispute among the neighbouring estates. It passed quickly through the hands of Hungary in 1254, until the Bohemian king Ottokar II Přemysl conquered it, being victorious at the 1260 Battle of Kressenbrunn. As King Ottokar II had married the last duke's sister Margaret of Babenberg he laid claim to both Austria and Styria, which however met with strong opposition by the elected German king Rudolph of Habsburg, who now recalled the duchies as reverted fiefs. Rudolph finally defeated Ottokar at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, seized Austria and Styria and granted them to his sons Albert I and Rudolf II. The House of Habsburg provided Styria with dukes of their lineage from that point on. The duchy was, however, separated from Austria by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, after which Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola formed the Inner Austrian territory ruled by the descendants of Leopold III of Habsburg of the Leopoldian line, who took their residence at Graz. In 1456 they could significantly enlarge the Styrian territory by acquisition and re-acquisition of the comital Celje estates in Lower Styria. Both duchies were again ruled in personal union, when Leopold's grandson Frederick V inherited Austria in 1457. In 1496 Frederick's son Maximilian I signed an order expelling all Jews from Styria, who were not allowed to return to Graz until 1856. In 1512 the duchy joined the Empire's Austrian Circle. A second Inner Austrian cadet branch of the Habsburgs ruled over Styria from 1564. Under Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, Graz became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, expedited by the Jesuits at the University of Graz established in 1585 and continued under Charles' son Archduke Ferdinand II, who became sole rule of all Habsburg hereditary lands and Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. The Protestant population was expelled, including the astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1600. Meanwhile, at the time of the Ottoman invasions in the 16th and 17th centuries after the 1526 Battle of Mohács, the land suffered severely and was depopulated. The Turks made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times; churches, monasteries, cities, and villages were destroyed and plundered, while the population was either killed or carried away into slavery. The Duchy of Styria in modern Austria and Slovenia Styria remained a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and from 1804 belonged to the Austrian Empire. The development of the duchy was decisively promoted by Archduke John of Austria, younger brother of Emperor Francis I, who in 1811 founded the Joanneum, predecessor of the Graz University of Technology, and the University of Leoben in 1840. He also forwarded the construction of the Semmering railway to Mürzzuschlag and the Austrian Southern Railway line from Vienna to Trieste completed in 1857, which boosted the Styrian economy. In the course of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (Ausgleich), the duchy was assigned as a crown land for the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, while along with the rise of nationalism the conflict between the German and Slovene population intensified. On the collapse of Austria-Hungary in the aftermath of World War I, the rump state of German Austria claimed all Cisleithanian Austria with a significant German-speaking population including large parts of the Styrian duchy, while the Slovene Lower Styrian part joined the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Armed conflicts arose especially around the multilingual town of Maribor (Marburg), until by the 1919 Treaty of St Germain the former duchy was partitioned broadly along ethnic lines, with two thirds of its territory (then called Upper Styria) including the ducal capital of Graz remaining with Austria, and the southern third of Lower Styria with Maribor passing to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, eventually becoming part of modern Slovenia.

Gen Abacha & co. Structure Crime organisations in Nigeria, typically do not follow the mafia-type model followed by other groups. They appear to be less formal and more organized along familial and ethnic lines, thus making them less susceptible by infiltration from law enforcement. Police investigations are further hampered by the fact there are at least 250 distinct ethnic languages in Nigeria. Other criminal gangs from Nigeria appear to be smaller- scale freelance operations.La Sorte, Mike. \\"Defining Organized Crime\\". AmericanMafia.com, May 2006. Groups from Benin City are especially notorious for human trafficking.  Area boys  Area boys (also known as Agberos) are loosely organized gangs of street children and teenagers, composed mostly of males, who roam the streets of Lagos, Lagos State in Nigeria.Simon Heap,“Their Days are Spent in Gambling and Loafing, Pimping for Prostitutes, and Picking Pockets”: Male Juvenile Delinquents on Lagos Island, Nigeria, 1920s-60s’, Journal of Family History, 35(1), 2010, 48-70; http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/0363199009348306v1 They extort money from passers-by, public transporters and traders, sell illegal drugs, act as informal security guards, and perform other \\"odd jobs\\" in return for compensation. One of the methods Area Boys use for extortion is to surround pedestrians, drivers, and passengers in vehicles, which are stuck in traffic, and force them to pay for some actual or fictitious service before letting them go. To aid in collecting money during traffic jams, the area boys place nails in the road and dig up the streets.Momoh, p. 193 Among the area boys are both sellers and users of illegal drugs.Momoh, p. 195 A study states \\"most of them use drugs (cocaine, heroin, marijuana, etc.) either as occasional users or addicts, or as peddlers.\\" Of 77 respondents to a survey, 12.2% dealt drugs, while 60.3% were addicts themselves. Sale of drugs takes place both in Nigeria and abroad, and sales abroad have earned a small percentage of the sellers significant amounts of money.Momoh, p. 195  Confraternities  Neo Black Movement often claim to be entirely unrelated to Black Axe in public statements, however the symbol is shown on their posters. Highly organised Nigerian confraternities/campus gangs operate worldwide. For example the Neo Black Movement of Africa. In its own words, the Neo Black Movement of Africa is a \\"registered non-partisan, non-religious and non-tribal organisation that sincerely seek to revive, retain and modify where necessary those aspects of African culture that would provide vehicles of progress for Africa and her peoples\\". Nonetheless, law enforcement officials who have investigated members in recent years, for example in Canada, the UK and Italy are convinced that the movement has strayed far from its original path. Behind the welfare facade of the Neo Black Movementnbmarena.org hides indeed the most dreaded Nigerian campus cult, the Black Axe confraternity. NBM usually state that they are not identical with Black Axe for propaganda purposes. While the atrocities committed by campus cult members are well-known, very little is known about other activities of the Neo Black Movement. Offiong claims that the group's initial goal of promoting black consciousness and fighting for the dignity of Africans and their freedom from neo-colonialism has deteriorated into self- serving behaviour that is \\"notoriously and brutally violent\\".Offiong 2003, 69–70 He maintains that violence has in fact become the cult's official policy.Offiong 2003, 70 Apart from the atrocities in the orbit of NBM, most members of the confraternity are involved in fraud and cyber crime. The main reason to join the confraternity is (besides the pressure and intimidationhttp://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T%20&%20T/T%20&%20T-07-0-000-09-Web/T%20&%20T-07-1-000-09-Abst- PDF/T&T-07-1-017-09-175-Egbochuku-E-O;/T&T-07-1-017-09-175-Egbochuku-E-O- Tt.pdf; that is applied to students to join) the fact that the confraternity has infiltrated all spheres of Nigerian society and serves the main purpose of helping its members climb the career ladder and going unpunished for their crimes by means of their nepotistic structure. Investigations and a number of arrests of members of NBM by the Italian police brought to light various crimes committed by members of NBM. NBM and other cults were found guilty of smuggling of drugs, extortion, 419 fraud, prostitution, passport falsification, and cloning of credit cards. In 2011, eight more members of NBM were arrested in Italy for the same offenses mentioned above. They are referred to as an international criminal organisation and Nigerian Mafia.Arresti in Campania per Black Axe, la mafia nigeriana According to internal documents, the confraternity helps members to immigrate illegally to Europe. Nigerian fraud rings have been exported to Europe, America, and Asia (see external links section). In 2015 a sophisticated car theft ring run by the Black Axe organized crime ring was busted in Toronto, Canada. The ring had stolen more than 500 luxury cars in one year, valued at 30 million US dollars. According to the police, the Nigerians are increasing their alliances with the Neapolitan Camorra and the Sicilian Mafia, the alliances are most regarded to prostitution, drugs and human trafficking business. Activities  Fraud  An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and one of the most common types of confidence tricks. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster requires in order to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim or simply disappears. Drug trafficking Nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping heroin from Asian countries to Europe and America; and cocaine from South America to Europe and South Africa. The large numbers of ethnic Nigerians in countries like India and Thailand give their gangs ready access to around 90% of the world's heroin.Federal Bureau of Investigation. \\"Organized Crime: African Criminal Enterprises\\". In the United States, Nigerian drug traffickers are important distributors of heroin, from importing it into the country to distribution level and selling it to lower-level street gangs.\\"National Drug Threat Assessment 2009 - Heroin\\". National Drug Intelligence Center, December 208. Accessed 1 July 2010. These criminal groups are also known to launder drug money through domestic football clubs in the Nigeria Premier League, and are rumored to make additional money through match fixing activity within football matches.  Human trafficking & kidnappings  Nigeria is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons including forced labor and forced prostitution. There is a huge menace of Kidnappings on Northern Highways as well as allover Nigeria, claims to be from Fulani Bandits. Trafficked Nigerian women and children are recruited from rural areas within Nigeria - women and girls for involuntary domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, and boys for forced labor in street vending, domestic servitude, mining, and begging.\\"Nigeria\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Nigerian women and children are taken from Nigeria to other West and Central African countries, primarily Gabon, Cameroon, Ghana, Chad, Benin, Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso, and the Gambia, for the same purposes. Children from West African states like Benin, Togo, and Ghana – where Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) rules allow for easy entry – are also forced to work in Nigeria, and some are subjected to hazardous jobs in Nigeria's granite mines. Nigerian women and girls are taken to Europe, especially to Italy and Russia, and to the Middle East and North Africa, for forced prostitution. Impact According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Nigerian criminal enterprises are the most notable of all African criminal enterprises. They are considered to be among the most aggressive and expansionist international criminal groups, operating in more than 80 countries of the world and are established on all populated continents of the world. Their most profitable activity is drug trafficking, though they are more famous for their financial fraud which costs the US alone approximately US$1 to 2 billion annually. Nigerian organized crime in other countries Canada Police in Toronto became aware of the presence of the Black Axe gang in 2013. The gang exerts influence over Canada's Nigerian expatriate community and is predominantly involved in scamming.

Ian was born in 1965, he grew up in the small village of Sutton Poyntz near Weymouth in Dorset and attended Broadway Secondary School until leaving in 1981. Prior to his television career, Crocker commentated for Capital Gold in London, alongside Jonathan Pearce and Steve Wilson (who are both now BBC commentators). He then spent several years with BRMB Radio in Birmingham commentating on Aston Villa and Birmingham City. During this period, Crocker began providing occasional commentaries for BSkyB. He covered some live Premier League matches during Sky's first season of coverage 1992/93, before joining permanently in 1997.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iul2xgCcopo After joining Sky, Crocker commentated regularly on Premier League matches, but was best known for his four years (1998–2002) as the voice of Scottish football, covering live matches from the Scottish Premier League, Scottish Cup and Scottish internationals. After Sky lost the rights to the SPL, Crocker became Sky's chief football league commentator between 2002 and 2006. Although being given occasional live Premier League matches between 2005 and 2006, Crocker was clearly behind the Sky \\"Big Four\\" of Martin Tyler, Rob Hawthorne, Alan Parry and Ian Darke in the commentating pecking order. As a result, Crocker left Sky to progress his career with Setanta Sports, working for them during the following three years. Crocker was Setanta's lead commentator on the SPL, and also shared commentating duties with Jon Champion on Setanta's 46 'live' Premier League games. Setanta went into administration in June 2009 and the UK side of their broadcasting operations was wound up soon after. Crocker went freelance and spent the next season (2009–2010) working for a variety of different outlets. Setanta's sports rights were carved up, with some of the SPL matches returning to Sky, and Crocker was contracted to be Sky's SPL commentator again, seven years after he had previously fulfilled the role. Crocker also worked on UEFA Champions League matches for STV who produced their own in-house coverage, with separate commentary and presentation, of the same matches shown on ITV1. Crocker was also contracted to work for ITV1 on their FA Cup Highlights shows, as well as being heard by an international audience commentating on Premier League matches for Premier League Productions. Crocker travelled to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup where he was ITV's fourth commentator, covering two matches live and several other matches for their highlights shows, including Switzerland's defeat of Spain, and Portugal's 7–0 victory over North Korea. In September 2010, it was announced that Ian Darke was leaving Sky Sports to join ESPN America as their leading football commentator. Crocker was subsequently re-signed by Sky Sports on a permanent basis as an integral part of their football commentating line- up. Crocker commentates frequently for Sky Sports coverage of Scottish football.

A slaveholder, Prentice initially supported Unionist candidate John Bell in the 1860 U.S. Presidential election, and after the American Civil War began urged Kentucky to remain neutral.

Although the biography sold 20,000 copies (and Clay remained one of Kentucky's U.S. Senators), Prentice received no money for the book because the Hartford publisher went bankrupt. Henry Clay also never became President of the United States as he had dreamed, losing in 1832 as he had in 1824 and would again in 1844. Meanwhile, Prentice accepted an offer to co-found the Louisville Journal newspaper in 1830, with the twin goals of further promoting Henry Clay, and rivaling the then-dominant Louisville Public Advertiser. Prentice soon found himself in an editorial feud with Advertiser publisher Shadrack Penn, which continued until Penn left the city in 1841. Prentice's biting editorials and the savage wit of his replies to detractors helped make the Journal the most widely circulated newspaper in western America in the next four decades. Prentice was also a poet, whose best-known poem, \\"The Closing Year\\" (written on New Year's Eve 1836) would be included in one of McGuffey's Readers. He also befriended and was a mentor to poetess Mary Louisa Chitwood (1832-1855). Prentice became known for militant editorials before elections, which varied little over the next 25 years despite his changing party affiliation. He initially promoted the Whig Party. He became a party leader, attended various national conventions and also visited Washington D.C. In mid-1855, as the party disintegrated, Prentice editorialized in support of the Know-Nothing party and the pro-slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-foreigner movement that reached a hysterical level in the 1850s in many parts of the nation. In Louisville this culminated in the Bloody Monday riot of August 6, 1855, in which 22 people were killed as mobs tried to prevent Irish and German citizens from voting on election day. Days before, Prentice had editorialized against the \\"most pestilent influence of the foreign swarms\\" loyal to a pope he called \\"an inflated Italian despot who keeps people kissing his toes all day.\\" According to Archbishop John Lancaster Spalding, Prentice later publicly expressed regret over his role in the riots. On July 21, 1857, Prentice engaged in a pistol duel with Reuben T. Durrett over statements made between their two rival newspapers. Prentice also contributed columns to the New York Ledger for several years, and in 1859, a New York firm published Prenticeana: or wit and humor, which would be republished shortly after his death.Appleton's biography Civil War and aftermath Prentice supported the Union in the 1850s and the Constitutional Union Party in 1860, but disagreed with many of President Lincoln's policies during the Civil War, especially the decision to emancipate slaves. In 1861 Prentice joined a group that urged Kentucky not secede from the Union but instead establish itself as a neutral party in the war. Nonetheless, Louisville was occupied by Union troops for almost the entire war, and resentment seethed. Both Prentice's sons joined the Confederate army, and the elder, William, died September 21, 1862 (shortly after the Battle of Antietam and as Union troops massed in Louisville to attack General Braxton Bragg's forces). His son Clarence rose to the rank of Major in Dortch's 2nd battalion, Kentucky Cavalry. In 1864 Prentice created the famous \\"Sue Mundy\\" guerrilla character to mock Union General Stephen G. Burbridge, military commander of Kentucky. After the war Prentice opposed many of the policies of Reconstruction, as did the city's other major editor, Walter N. Haldeman of the Louisville Courier, which Union forces had seized and shut in September 1861 because of Haldeman's Confederate sympathies (he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and then Madison, Georgia, and returned to Louisville a hero after the war's end). Prentice's paper was one of the few that criticized federal rebuilding policies of the time. Prentice remained as editor of the paper during and after the 1868 merger of the Louisville Courier, Louisville Journal and Louisville Democrat that created The Courier- Journal, although he soon died and Haldeman's protege and dedicated Confederate veteran Henry Watterson became editor and would write and speak widely about his Southern viewpoint (although born in Washington DC as the son of a Tennessee Congressman). Death and legacy 1912 Statue of Prentice in Louisville He died of influenza on January 22, 1870, less than two years after his wife, and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. His successor editor at the Louisville Courier-Journal delivered and printed a eulogy, and a Philadelphia publisher republished the 1859 essay collection in 1870 with a new preface. Although the newspaper survives to this day, Prentice's legacy became generally unfavorable over time, with 1993 feature article on the newspaper's history calling Prentice's writings \\"raw bigotry\\" and a 2005 article recalling the Bloody Monday riot. A statue of Prentice by Alex Bouly was completed in 1875. It was originally displayed at the Courier-Journal building in Louisville, Kentucky, but was moved in 1914 to the front of the Louisville Free Public Library's main branch. It has been a source of occasional controversy, due to Prentice's famous anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant rhetoric. A compromise reached at one point involved the city placing a new plaque for the statue, describing Prentice's \\"tarnished legacy\\". The statue was removed and placed into storage in 2018. A Liberty ship, the SS George D. Prentice, was launched in 1943 and remained in service until 1969.

The Quiet Enemy was reissued in the Penguin Contemporary American Fiction series, and again, in 1996, by the Georgia University Press. During 1966–67, a play in two acts by Dawkins, The Displaced Person, based on the stories of Flannery O'Connor \\"with her knowledge and input,\\" was produced in New York City by the American Place Theater. Dawkins regularly corresponded with O'Connor. A large number of O'Connor's letters to Dawkins are published in Letters of Flannery O'Connor: The Habit of Being, edited by Sally Fitzgerald. In 1971, Harper and Row published Dawkins' first novel, The Live Goat, winner of the Harper-Saxton Fellowship. Her second novel, Charleyhorse, published by Viking in 1985, was reissued by Penguin in 1986 and again by Allison in 1989.

History During the 2017 and 2018 season, the Bob had several issues and was closed for several months in order to fix these. These included issues with trains rolling back on the lift hill and issues with the brakes. Since 2017, the Bob closed down during rain, as the brakes were unable to stop the trains when the track was wet. In October 2018, the Bob reopened and it was announced that it was going to close down permanently on 1 September 2019 to make place for the powered coaster Max & Moritz, based on the German tale of the same name.  Characteristics  \\"Bobbaan\\" had 8 trains, each with a capacity of 6 passengers. The original Bobsleds, with inline seating, were replaced with new trains that sit 2 across in order to increase the ride capacity and fight back the extreme queue times (of up to 90 minutes). The original Bobsled cars were replaced by sleds with a wooden theming that matches the station's classical Austrian Alps style. The original trains were sold to Six Flags Over Texas for their La Vibora bobsled roller coaster. It was a smooth ride, especially since the original steel wheels were replaced by softer ones in order to comply with the night- opening license. The ride meanders through the trees, and has some drops, curves and points where the ride really picks up some speed. The music in the station is traditional Austrian music.

He succeeded in office Bishop Thomas, who had resigned three years earlier. Bero seems to have been the same \\"Bishop B. of Finland\\" (B episcopus de Finlandia) who is listed among other Swedish bishops in a document from 1253, the first so appearing.. In Latin.

Residence in Koroinen Koroinen today. The former episcopal residence is completely ruined. Koroinen in the 13th century. Scale model in the Castle of Turku Museum. According to the older Chronicon, Bero was the first bishop to be buried in Räntämäki, apparently in Koroinen, the semi-fortified episcopal residence near Turku along the Aura river.Scale model of Koroinen episcopal residence . The stone vestry was added after Bero's time. Bishop seems to have lived in the larger stone house, while the smaller one was a defence tower. Castle of Turku, Middle Ages exhibit. Archaeological excavations have revealed three episcopal graves from the church ruins, rather certainly belonging to Bero and his two successors that were all claimed to have been buried there. It is not known, when the see was moved to Koroinen, but Bishop Thomas is known to have worked in Nousiainen still in 1234.. In Latin. Some historians believe that the see was moved to Koroinen already before Bero, even as early as 1229, but that remains speculative. The modest cathedral in Koroinen, entirely made of wood at the time of Bero, was dedicated to Saint Mary, like the previous see in Nousiainen. Cathedral's dedication to Saint Mary continued also later, when it was moved to its current location in Turku at the end of the 13th century. In addition to Koroinen, there were larger Swedish garrisons four kilometers along the Aura river inland, later known as the \\"Old Castle of Lieto\\". Dominicans Koroinen was also the home of the first Dominican convent in Finland. According to Dominican annals of their Skänninge abbey, the brotherhood seems to have arrived to the country with Bero and his retinue in 1249.. In Latin. Dominicans also left Koroinen with the bishop at the end of the 13th century, moving close to the new Cathedral of Turku. Their convent in Turku was dedicated to Saint Olav. Legacy Bero was succeeded by Bishop Ragvald. Bero appears to have been the last Bishop of Finland, since his successors were referred to as the Bishop of Turku, first mentioned in 1259 (episcopo et dilectis filiis capitulo Aboensi). in 1259. In Latin. Naming the bishopric by the see harmonized its name with other Swedish dioceses, in a way a milestone in Finland's integration to Sweden. Counting from Bero, the Finnish church remained under Archbishop of Uppsala for 560 years.

BSP currently services over 650,000 business banking customers throughout the Pacific. As at 31 December 2014, BSP had total assets valued at K15.8 billion. Bank South Pacific is listed on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange. History BSP Bank ATMs at Sigatoka Town Centre BSP Headquarters in Port Moresby BSP traces its history to 1 May 1957 when the National Bank of Australasia established a branch in Port Moresby. As independence approached for Papua New Guinea (PNG), the incoming government made known its desire that all banks in PNG be locally incorporated, rather than branches of a foreign parent. Bank of Papua New Guinea, the country's central bank, was established in 1973. The National Australia Bank (NAB) incorporated its operations in PNG in 1974. Then the government encouraged the bank to sell equity to local citizens. BSP conducted public offerings in 1980 and 1981, with the result that local citizens came to hold 13% of the bank's shares. Later, the government decided to acquire control of BSP. In 1993, National Investment Holdings Limited (NIHL) first acquired NAB's 87% shareholding, and then the 13% of the shares in the hands of the public, giving it 100% ownership of BSP. In 1995 the government decided to increase the bank's capital base, which it achieved by selling a 25% stake to Credit Corporation (PNG) and a 22% stake to Motor Vehicles Insurance (PNG) Trust (now incorporated as Motor Vehicles Insurance Limited). In 1916, Commonwealth Bank, the Australian government-owned bank, established a branch in Rabaul and agencies in other towns, to support the banking needs of the Australian Army and its troops who had taken control of the former German colony of New Guinea. In time, this operation became a full-fledged commercial banking operation. Then in 1974, Commonwealth Bank withdrew from PNG by transferring its operations to the new government, which gave the bank the name \\"Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation\\" (PNGBC). In 2002, PNGBC ran into problems, and BSP acquired the government's 49% stake in PNGBC in return for the government taking a 25% stake in BSP. Between 2002 and 2008 BSP and PNGBC merged the operations. South Pacific expansion Since 2004, BSP has pursued a strategy of expanding in the South Pacific. It acquired Westpac's branch in Niue, which was the only bank of any kind on the island. Westpac had established the branch in 1988 but was interested in reducing some of its operations in the area. In April 2013, BSP sold the Niue branch to New Zealand bank Kiwibank. In 2006, BSP acquired the National Bank of Solomon Islands from the Solomon Islands government, which at the time had the largest network of offices (eight branches and eight agencies) in the islands. BSP also acquired Habib Bank (Fiji), which had begun in 1991 as a branch of HBL Pakistan. In October 2009, BSP acquired the Colonial National Bank in Fiji from the Commonwealth Bank. Operations in Samoa, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Tonga In 1988 Westpac acquired the European Pacific Banking Corporation in the Cook Islands and a HSBC subsidiary, the Solomon Islands Banking Corporation, which HSBC had established as a branch in 1973. Westpac also acquired HSBC's branches, one each, in Fiji and the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu). (HSBC had established its branch in Fiji only some 18 months earlier.) In 1990, Bank of New Zealand sold half its shares in Bank of Tonga to Westpac and half to Bank of Hawaii, giving each of them 30%. In 2001 Bank of Hawaii sold its interest in Pacific Commercial Bank (42.7%) to Westpac, which held an equal portion. WBC offered Samoan investors, who held the remaining shares, the same price it had paid Bank of Hawaii. Westpac ended up owning 93.5% of Westpac Bank Samoa and Samoan companies and individuals owned 6.5%. In Tonga, Bank of Hawaii sold its shares in Bank of Tonga to Westpac, giving WBC 60% ownership of what became Westpac Bank of Tonga. On 29 January 2015, BSP announced that BSP had entered into an agreement to acquire Westpac's banking operations in Samoa, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Tonga for A$125 million. The final stage of the acquisition was completed in July 2016. In July 2020 BSP celebrated its fifth anniversary of operations in the Cook Islands.

Original format Info-Mac consisted of two distinct services: the Info-Mac Archive, a user-submitted collection of nearly all contemporary freeware and shareware available for the Macintosh, and the Info-Mac Digest, an electronic mailing list open to public participation.Engst, Adam C, and David Pogue (1999). Crossing Platforms: a Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook. O'Reilly Media, Inc. p. 317. Both the Info-Mac Archive and Info-Mac Digest were operated by volunteers.Levine, John R, Arnold Reinhold and Margaret Levine Young (2000). The Internet for Dummies Quick Reference. IDG Books Worldwide. p. 112. Info-Mac Digest The Info-Mac Digest was published daily via Stanford University servers, and was itself archived on the Info-Mac Archive.Wilson, Thomas Carl (1992). Impact of Technology on Resource Sharing: Experimentation and Maturity. Psychology Press. p. 124. At its height, the Info-Mac Digest was read daily by several thousand people, and was mirrored in the Usenet group comp.sys.mac.digest. The Info-Mac Digest was published in \\"volumes\\" that covered the period of one calendar year, with some exceptions. Info-Mac Archive The Info-Mac Archive was the centralized collection of Macintosh software with over 100 mirror sites located around the world. At the time, disk space on a server was cost-prohibitive and hard to come by. Free public archives such as Info-Mac were often the only means for shareware authors to deliver their product over the Internet. Some early commercial software download sites, like CNET's Shareware.com, were originally mirrors of the Info-Mac Archive.TidBITS#810/19-Dec-05 Due to the low-bandwidth connections accessible by early Internet users, which made downloading large files an onerous task, Info-Mac partnered with Pacific HiTech to periodically publish CD-ROMs containing selected shareware and freeware from the archive. These CDs were sold through Mac-related magazines and publications.The Multimedia and Cd-ROM Directory 1998. Waterlow New Media Information. p. 621. Licensing issues required software authors to specifically allow their contributions to be included on the CD-ROM through a statement in the file's abstract. The CDs allowed wider distribution to users who did not have network access or could not spare the long download times associated with software applications. As the software was encoded in BinHex or MacBinary format it could be stored on non-Mac file systems such as a BBS or FTP server. Starting with the Info-Mac VI CD-ROM, the discs included the utility \\"Spelunker\\" which allowed users to search the archive in a user-friendly manner. Starting with the Info-Mac VIII CD-ROM, the package included two discs to offer twice the shareware and freeware. Decline and 2007 relaunch The popularity of Info-Mac services in their original format waned in the late 1990s. As the growing popularity of the world wide web and web hosting services allowed software authors to distribute their own software, and for users to communicate on online message boards, demand for Info-Mac's services grew beyond the capability of an all- volunteer staff to provide and maintain it at an acceptable level. Unable to maintain relevance on the rapidly evolving Internet, the Info-Mac Digest was discontinued in November 2002, while the Info-Mac Archive stopped accepting new file submissions in December 2005. In December 2007, Info-Mac was redesigned and relaunched with a Web 2.0 interface, combining previous Info- Mac Digest and Info-Mac Archive content with a modernized forum-based community and news aggregator.Info-Mac Reloaded Today, Info-Mac has expanded to cover all Apple product lines.

It is a park near the northern edge of the city. Included in the park are jogging paths, playgrounds, tennis courts, a golf course, swimming pool, horse park and amphitheater. Location The wedge-shaped park is bounded on the east side by Lake Forrest Drive, on the west-southwest side by Powers Ferry Road and on the north-northwest end by West Wieuca Road. It is bisected in the middle by Nancy Creek, flowing from east to west. It is surrounded by forested neighborhoods in the Buckhead area of the city, and is northwest of the original Buckhead Village and the uptown Lenox area. Chastain Park is also a neighborhood on the west side of the park (across Powers Ferry Road to the west). The neighborhood is bordered by the city of Sandy Springs on the north, and by the Atlanta neighborhoods of Mount Paran/Northside on the west across Northside Drive and Tuxedo Park on the south. It is part of NPU A. The population was 2,398 as of 2010. History The land was originally occupied by Creek Indians, near the floodplain Nancy Creek. In 1840, the land was acquired by DeKalb County and used as a site for town hall meetings. In 1900, the land was sold to Fulton County with plans to build an almshouse for the poor. In 1909, the North Fulton Alm House opened, providing separate housing for whites and blacks. The housing was designed in a Neoclassical style by architectural firm Morgan and Dillon. At the start of the Great Depression, the Almshouse Cemetery was constructed. In 1940, Fulton County proposed to construct a residential area on a large portion of the land. Both almshouses were planned to be demolished, although the cemetery would be left unharmed. Under the direction of Troy Green Chastain (Fulton County Commissioner) and with help from the Works Progress Administration, the North Fulton neighborhood was born. Out of the original 1,000 acres, 268 became \\"North Fulton Park\\". The park was composed of the North Fulton Golf Course, a clubhouse, Olympic-sized swimming pool, tennis courts, gymnasium, bathhouse, horse stables and polo field. The construction of the park was completed in 1945, a year after the death of Chastain. To honor his contribution of the park, the county renamed the park, the \\"Chastain Memorial Park\\" on September 25, 1946. Features Path PATH Foundation began constructing a trail in Chastain Park in 1994, which has since expanded to a three-mile trail around Chastain Park and North Fulton Golf Course. PATH estimates an average of 250 people use the trail each hour, and is developing a second loop in the northern area of the park to meet demand. Pool A pool is also located within Chastain Park. It is a city pool, meaning it is open to the public most of the time, but nonmembers must pay to get in, and there are some times when only members can swim.

Westminster Abbey, London. Those commemorated are (l. to r.): Maximilian Kolbe, Manche Masemola, Janani Luwum, Grand Duchess Elizabeth of Russia, Martin Luther King Jr., Óscar Romero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Esther John, Lucian Tapiedi, and Wang Zhiming. Wang Zhiming () (1907 – December 29, 1973) was a Miao pastor little known outside his home in Wuding County, Yunnan, China at the time of his execution on December 29, 1973. Since then, he has received two unique honors. In 1981, he became the only Christian martyr of the Cultural Revolution to have a monument erected at his gravesite. Then in 1998, he was one of ten 20th century Christian martyrs memorialized above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey with a statue. These statues represent those who died in the name of Christ in the century marked by the greatest number of martyrdoms in the history of the church.  Life and work  Wang Zhiming was born in Wuding in 1907, the year after Christian missionaries Samuel Pollard, Arthur G. Nicholls, George E. Metcalf and Gladstone Porteous first began work there. Their work among minority people, especially the Miao in Wuding, saw much fruit. By 1949, 130,000 Protestants, nearly 20% of the total for China, were found among Yunnan's minorities. Five years later half of the Christians in Yunnan reportedly lived in the prefecture which included Wuding. Wang was educated in Christian schools and later taught in one for ten years. In 1944 he was elected chairman of the church council in Wuding, and he was ordained in 1951 at the age of 44.Joakim Enwall A myth become reality: history and development of the Miao written language 1995 – 241 \\"In Wuding county in the Chuxiong Yi AP there are altogether some 40 churches, with 17000 believers. ... After Arthur G Nicholls left in 1944 Wang Zhiming took charge of the church work in Wuding, Luquan, Fumin SS, Yuanmou\\" During the 1950s Wang was one of six Miao Christian leaders who accommodated some of the demands of the new government by signing the Three Self Manifesto. Still, he refused to participate in denunciation meetings held to humiliate landlords, saying, \\"My hands have baptized many converts, and should not be used for sinfulness\\". This was undoubtedly one of the reasons that, even before the Cultural Revolution, Wang was declared a counter-revolutionary.John C. England Asian Christian Theologies: Northeast Asia 2004 \\"Wang Zhiming (1907–1973) ... When the Cultural Revolution came to Wuding, he was known to be a critic of the atheistic campaigns of local Red Guards. In May 1969 he and other members of his family were arrested.\\"  Martyrdom  During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), at least 21 Christian leaders in Wuding were imprisoned, and many others were sent to camps, denounced or beaten. One later stated, In 1969, Wang Zhiming and his wife and sons were arrested. On December 29, 1973, Wang was executed in a stadium in front of more than 10,000 people. The largely Christian crowd was not cowed into submission by the spectacle, but rather many rushed the stand where they berated the prosecuting official.  Legacy  After the Cultural Revolution, official attempts to placate the Miao included a compensatory payment of 1,300 yuan (then $250) to Wang's family. However, the real compensation for the great suffering of Wang and the other Christians in Wuding has come in church growth. When Wang Zhiming was arrested, there were 2,795 Christians in Wuding. By 1980 the church had grown to about 12,000, and Wuding now has over 30,000 Christians and more than 100 places of worship. Sporadic persecution in Wuding continues. References * Hattaway, Paul.

This case prompted authorities to raid the family's church in 2004 because it supports corporal punishment.  The case  Josef Smith died at a children's hospital after paramedics were called to the family's home in Mableton, an Atlanta suburb. In October 2003 the boys' parents had told authorities Josef had passed out and never regained consciousness after the family gathered in the kitchen to participate in a prayer session with their church via the Internet. Mr. Smith reportedly told police that when he went to pick his son up that he was \\"warm to the touch, wet with sweat, and unresponsive.\\" Smith thought his son was overheating and he had carried the boy out to the carport and laid him down on the concrete hoping it would have a cooling effect, but that it didn't. They then called 911. Cobb County fire and rescue responded and found the eight-year-old lying on his back in the dining room, not breathing and without a pulse. He was rushed to the hospital where doctors later determined he was brain dead. He died a day later. Cobb County medical examiners concluded that eight-year-old Josef Smith died as a result of \\"acute and chronic\\" abuse. Police said that the parents often locked the boy in a closet and forced him to pray to a picture of Jesus. The Smiths admitted disciplining their son by striking him with a glue stick, but claimed the punishment never rose to the level of abuse.  Church connection  The Smiths were members of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based Remnant Fellowship Church since they joined in 2000, which grew out of church leader Gwen Shamblin's Weigh Down Workshop, a Christian diet program she created in 1986. Authorities raided the church in June 2004 as part of the investigation of Josef Smith's death. The Smiths were arrested in December 2003 and spent four months in jail before Remnant church members posted their bond.http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=42009 In an interview with Gwen Shamblin, she said that Remnant church members decided to collectively foot the Smiths' legal bills. Former members of the Smiths' church said the groups teachings on discipline include discussion of corporal punishment. Church leaders stated that they leave discipline to parents and that spankings are a last resort. At one point, Remnant Fellowship's website contained the following testimony from a member: \\"I was hesitant and sometimes refused to properly discipline my children because I didn't want to 'hurt' them or have them hate me.\\" Now, \\"I discipline my children in order to save their souls from hell rather than being concerned about their flesh.\\" Before jury selection, the Smiths' attorneys stated that the defense had made a deal with prosecution to limit the church's involvement in the trial. Police investigators said they could not find any link between the boy's death and the religious institution. Remnant Fellowship is the owner of www.thesmithsareinnocent.com which attempts to lay out their reasoning for the Smiths' innocence. At one point they also owned www.thesmithsareguilty.com which automatically redirected you to the www.thesmithsareinnocent.com website. Their site mainly contends that Joseph died from a bacterial infection as a result of \\"his chronic eczema and continual scratching he was plagued with.\\" After the Smiths' eventual conviction, Tedd Anger, one of the church's leaders, said they still believe the Smiths are innocent. However, both the Cobb County medical examiner and the state medical examiner did agree that Josef's death was a homicide, not an accidental death and not a death due to illness. At the trial, witnesses for the state called it one of the worst cases of child abuse they'd ever seen.http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=92302&provider;=top As of 2013, the Smiths are still members of Remnant Fellowship.  Charges  Joseph and Sonya Smith were each charged with four counts of murder, five counts of first-degree cruelty to children, three counts of aggravated assault and two counts of false imprisonment.  The trial   Prosecution  Prosecutors in the trial said Joseph and Sonya Smith beat their son Josef, locked him in a wooden box and confined him to a closet for hours at a time before he died in October 2003.  Defense  The defense attorney for the Smiths said the injuries on the boy's body did not cause the boy's death and that the medical examiner did not perform tests that would have cleared his clients. During the trial, the defense attorney pointed out that there was no DNA evidence to prove the boy was locked inside the wooden box as the prosecution claimed. The defense also said the closet that prosecutors accused the parents of locking the boy in had no wall to prevent him from going into his bedroom, because his father had been renovating the house. The defense claimed that the boy died from septic shock resulting from a severe staph infection. Within an hour of the boy's arrival at the Cobb County Hospital Emergency Room, his blood test result came back \\"Gram positive for Coagulase- Negative Staphylococcus\\" and showed a white blood cell count of 21.5 thou/uL (the normal range is between 3.4 and 9.5). He also had a high fever that the medical staff were able to bring down to 102.5 °F. A CAT scan of the head indicated there was no bleeding, no hemorrhage, no concussion, and no skull fracture. A CAT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis all came back showing \\"no signs of acute and internal hemorrhage nor significant injury\\".  Verdict and sentencing  The Smiths were found guilty by all 12 members of the jury on February 16, 2007 which coincidentally would have been Josef's 12th birthday. They were both found guilty on 11 counts: one count each of felony murder, reckless conduct, false imprisonment; three counts of aggravated assault, and four counts of cruelty to children (two specifically pertaining to glue sticks and others to unknown objects) After being convicted, the Smiths were then sentenced on March 27, 2007 to life plus 30 years in prison, the maximum punishment, by Cobb County Superior Court Judge James Bodiford. At the sentencing hearing approximately two dozen supporters for the Smiths were in the courtroom, and several friends spoke on the couple's behalf, describing them as kind. The judge called the letters of support for the Smiths \\"amazing,\\" but said the supporters likely didn't have all the details. Appeal proceedings One of the church's leaders, said they still believe the Smiths are innocent and that the church would \\"... support the Smiths in any way possible\\". The Church is standing by the couple and helping fund their legal appeals and solicit donations for them on the Internet. Attorney, Manubir Singh Arora, who represented the Smiths at trial will not be handling their appeal. He told reporters that he was surprised and impressed by the level of support the church had shown the couple. Frankly they've helped out a ton, Arora said. And while people may or may not agree with whatever their beliefs are or the weight loss issues, the fact someone is willing to stick it out with you during one of the worst cases and worst times shows they're decent people. The defendants did file a motion in Cobb county for new trial arguing the \\"ineffective assistance of counsel\\" of their defense lawyer, but that was denied on Oct 8, 2009 An appeal was then brought to the Supreme Court of Georgia. This appeal was denied on Nov 8, 2010 when the Supreme Court of Georgia on a 5-2 vote upheld the murder convictions and life prison sentences given to both Joseph and Sonya Smith. The dissenting opinions cited improper conduct of the trial judge for allowing unfair and potentially prejudicial \\"theatrics\\" by the prosecution to gain an outcome based on passion rather than on the facts of the case. They also cited inadequate jury instructions and definitions for some of the specific charges.http://www.gasupreme.us/sc-op/op_summaries/nov_8.pdf A petition was filed on Feb 7, 2011 with the United States Supreme Court asking the Supreme Court to review the decisions made in the lower courts.

The pump contains a chamber which has a valved inlet from the fluid to be pumped, a valved outlet - both of these at the bottom of the pump, and a pressurant inlet at the top of the pump. A pressurant is used, such as steam or pressurized helium, to drive the fluid through the pump. Introduction NASA have developed a Low cost rocket fuel pump which has comparable performance to turbopump at 80-90% lower cost. Perhaps the most difficult barrier to entry in the liquid rocket business is the turbo pump. A turbo pump design requires a large engineering effort and is expensive to manufacture and test. Starting a turbo pump fed rocket engine is a complex process, requiring a careful synchronisation of many valves and subsystems. In fact, Beal aerospace tried to avoid the issue entirely by building a huge pressure feed booster. Their booster never flew, but the engineering behind it was sound and, if they had a low cost pump at their disposal, they might be competing against Boeing. This pump saves up to 90% of the mass of the tanks as compared to a pressure fed system. This pump has really proved to be a boon for rockets. By using this pump the rocket does not have to carry such a heavy load and can travel with very high speed. Working cycle The cycle is as follows: * The fluid enters and fills the chamber from the inlet valve. The outlet and pressurant valves are closed. * The inlet valve closes, the outlet and pressurant valves open. The presurant forces the fluid through the outlet valve. * As the chamber empties, the presurant valve closes and the inlet valve opens, followed by the outlet valve closing. * The cycle is repeated. Pumping rate Rocket engines requires a tremendous amount of fuel at high pressure. Often the pump costs more than the thrust chamber. One way to supply fuel is to use the expensive turbopump mentioned above, another way is to pressurize fuel tank. Pressurizing a large fuel tank requires a heavy, expensive tank. However suppose instead of pressurizing the entire tank, the main tank is drained into a small pump chamber which is then pressurized. To achieve steady flow, the pump system consists of two pump chambers such that each one supplies fuel for half of each cycle. The pump is powered by pressurized gas which acts directly on the fluid. For each half of the pump system, a chamber is filled from the main tank under low pressure and at a high flow rate, then the chamber is pressurized, and then the fluid is delivered to the engine at a moderate flow rate under high pressure. The chamber is then vented and cycle repeats. The system is designed so that the inlet flow rate is higher than the outlet flow rate. This allows time for one chamber to be vented, refilled and pressurized while the other is being emptied. A bread board pump has been tested and it works great. A high version has been designed and built and is pumping at 20 gpm and 550 psi.  Application in rocketry  It is most commonly used to supply propellants to rocket engines. In this configuration there are often two pumps working in opposite cycles to ensure a constant flow of propellants to the engine. The pump has the advantage over a pressure-fed system in that the tanks can be much lighter. Compared to a turbopump the pistonless pump is a much simpler design and has less stringent design tolerances. Advantages Nearly all of the hardware in this pump consists of pressure vessels, so the weight is low. There are less than 10 moving parts, and no lubrication issues which might cause problems with other pumps. The design and construction of this pump is straight forward and no precision parts are required. This device has advantage over standard turbopumps in that the weight is about the same, the unit, engineering and test costs are less and the chance for catastrophic failure is less. This pump has the advantage over pressure fed designs in that the weight of the complete rocket is much less, and the rocket is much safer because the tanks of rocket fuel do not need to be at high pressure. The pump could be started after being stored for an extended period with high reliability. It can be used to replace turbopumps for rocket booster option or it can be used to replace high pressure tanks for deep space propulsion. It can also be used for satellite orbit changes and station keeping. Disadvantages The pistonless pumps has disadvantages along with such fine advantages. # They cannot pump to higher pressure than drive gas (area ratio is 1:1) # They cannot use either a staged combustion or expander cycle. # A gas generator cycle is also difficult to integrate with the pistonless pump. # The generated gas must be chemically compatible with both the propellants. # This gas generator lowers the Ignition start period of the engine.

Before 1852, when this name was adopted, it was simply called Plaza Principal (\\"Main Square\\"). Plaza 25 de Mayo is located on the eastern edge of the present-day downtown area, not far from the Paraná River, and occupies the block defined by Santa Fe St., Buenos Aires St., Laprida St. and Córdoba St.. East of the plaza lie the seat of the executive branch of Rosario's municipal government, called Palacio de los Leones, and the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, seat of the Archdiocese of Rosario. These buildings are separated by a pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento, leading to the National Flag Memorial. The Memorial's propylaeum and stone tower can thus be clearly seen from the plaza. At the center of the plaza there is a monumental column dedicated to national freedom (Columna à la Libertad), with a statue representing Liberty standing on top, and surrounded by the statues of national heroes José de San Martín and Manuel Belgrano, journalist and independence activist Mariano Moreno, and first Argentine president Bernardino Rivadavia. The monument, which dates from 1883, was sculpted by Alejandro Biggi in Carrara marble.

During the Rhodesian Bush War, the regiment fought in several major campaigns and battles, particularly Operation Miracle in September 1979. It was superseded by the new Zimbabwe Armoured Corps between 1980 and 1981.Peter Gerard Locke & Peter David Farquharson Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965–80, P&P; Publishing, Wellington 1995 , p. 97 - 147. History World War II Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia began looking to raise a mechanised unit for the British Empire's ongoing war effort and established specialist training areas at Umtali accordingly. The resulting Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Unit was created in February 1941 and an intake of potential recruits from the Rhodesia Regiment accepted the following year.Rhodesian Armoured Corps A stylised sable head was chosen as the unit symbol, along with the motto Ase Sabi Luto – \\"We fear nothing\\" – later adopted as Asesabi Lutho in the Sindebele language. November 1942 saw the SRRU formally renamed the \\"Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Regiment\\" and the first intake's redeployment to Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Due to the regiment's exceptionally small numbers, it was swiftly integrated with the South African 6th Armoured Division. The 6th Armoured arrived in Egypt in mid-1943, too late to participate in the recent Tunisia Campaign. Major General Evered Poole, the division commander, was free to focus on routine exercises, desert training, and integration of his Southern Rhodesian personnel.6th South African Armoured Despite being entitled to wear the flashes and insignia of the South African Army, most Rhodesians also opted to retain their regimental lapels. Desert exercises on M4 Sherman tanks were carried out with the assistance of Britain's III Corps from December 1943 to January 1944. Although already briefed on their pending reassignment to Palestine, in April 1944 Poole's forces were unexpectedly shipped to Italy. The Rhodesians saw action with the Pretoria Regiment and C Squadron, 1 Special Service Battalion during maneuvers by I Canadian Corps along the Winter Line. Their first solo engagement with Wehrmacht contingents after the fall of Rome occurred near Paliano on 3 June. A particularly vicious battle was fought against Tiger I tanks of the 352nd Division six days later, in which Rhodesian Sherman crews played a prominent part. In recognition of their close association and service with the British 24th Guards Brigade during the Italian Campaign, the regiment was permitted to wear the colours of the Brigade of Guards at a farewell parade in March 1945. Interwar period Ferret scout cars attached to A Squadron, 1963 In December 1948 the Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Regiment was reestablished as the Southern Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment. Aside from a few Marmon Herringtons retained from wartime association with South Africa, 20 American T17E1 Staghounds – distinguished in Commonwealth service as the Staghound – were acquired. The Staghound was also of World War II vintage but remained ideally suited to local conflicts. It was swift, with a road speed hovering near ninety kilometres per hour, an excellent range of nearly eight hundred kilometres on one tank of fuel, and enough protection to withstand punishment from virtually all small arms. Directed by Lieutenant Colonel C.V. King, the regiment continued to undergo peace-time training but was largely inactive throughout the 1950s. In 1961, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland initiated a thorough reorganisation of the armed forces, and Southern Rhodesian Armoured Cars was reduced to a single squadron. Unit personnel initially shared a base with the Rhodesian Light Infantry near Bulawayo before being deployed to Ndola under the command of a Major P.F. Miller, where they remained throughout the Congo Crisis. During this period regimental colours in cerise and old gold were adopted, commemorating a longstanding affiliation with the 11th Hussars. In December 1963 the federation was abolished and A Squadron disbanded, its assets evenly divided between the two larger successor states. 28 Daimler Ferret scout cars were handed to Northern Rhodesia and later inherited by Zambia at independence. At least 10 Ferrets as well as all the remaining Staghounds were retained by Southern Rhodesia. Southern Rhodesian armour spent two years in deep storage before 1 Reconnaissance Troop, Rhodesian Light Infantry, requested some Staghounds for \\"interest training\\". The armoured cars had already been marked for scrap, but days prior to Ian Smith's Unilateral Declaration of Independence the notion was revisited and reconnaissance men summoned for training on the Staghounds.Support Commando, 1st Battalion The RLI encountered severe difficulty in locating trained drivers – to say nothing of servicing their condemned vehicles, which had already been stripped of all salvageable crew equipment. Two were restored and driven under their own power to Kariba on 10 November 1965 to arrest possible incursions by Zambian troops. A few hours before UDI security forces began fortifying the airstrip, intending to deny it by force to incoming Royal Air Force Javelins. It was decided to salute the occasion by firing a symbolic 37mm round towards Zambia. Twelve solid shot armour-piercing shells were drawn, six to each working Staghound. Only one car fired successfully, destroying its elderly breech protector in the process. Both were returned to the Rhodesian Army motor pool in early 1966. Rhodesian Bush War The unit's CO from inception to 1977 was Major Rooken Smith, and from 1978 was American Major Darrell Winkler. He was a field grade officer in the U.S. Army, who, after resignation went to South Africa first, and then towards Rhodesia. He was commissioned in the Rhodesian Army on 12 August 1977. The Rhodesian Armoured Corps then consisted of four squadrons, three of them were manned by territorials and only one squadron with a regular staff supplemented by National Servicemen. An Armoured Depot was established at Blakiston-Houston Barracks which conducted all armour training and housed the Headquarters, Stores, Signals and Workshop detachments adjacent to King George VI Barracks (Army HQ) on the outskirts of Salisbury. Their vehicles consisted of the Rolls-Royce powered Ferret Scout Car, housing a 7.62mm Browning machine-gun in a small hatch-topped turret and the GM-powered Eland Armoured Car, the South African-produced version on the French Panhard AML-90, equipped with a 90mm cannon and a co-axial 7.62mm Browning machine-gun in a fully enclosed revolving turret.Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965–80 (1995), p. 100. Later on the regiment received from South Africa eight captured T-55 main battle tanks, armed with a 100mm main cannon, a 7.62mm co- axial machine-gun and a 12.75mm anti aircraft gun.Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965–80 (1995), p. 97. RhACR Eland-90s in the field. They were fighting a counterinsurgency war for the most part but also continually trained for classical warfare in order to deal with enemies in neighbouring states who were equipped with T-34, T-55 and T-62 tanks, supported by Soviet, Red Chinese and Eastern European advisers. Heavy weapons deployed against the RhACR during border battles included 122mm rocket launchers, 75mm recoilless rifles and 82mm mortars. The TM46 anti-tank mine, often boosted, accounted for most of the regiment's casualties in the internal insurgency conflict.Robert K. Brown: The Black Devils, SOFMAG, 1979 The regiment took part in a number of static but intense battles, notably at Mount Selinda against the Mozambican Army (where a Bronze Cross was awarded to 2nd Lieutenant Rae) in 1977 and at Chirundu in October 1978, where heavy-machine gun, artillery and mortar duels took place between D Squadron and elements of the Zambian Army over a period of three days and nights near the Otto Beit Bridge. Elements of the RDR were also involved at close quarters at the bridge, while 1RR provided 81mm mortar and 106mm recoilless rifle fire support. In July 1977 D Squadron engaged a large group of ZANLA guerrillas north of Vila Salazar, while they were attempting to cross the border into Rhodesia, and it was reported that 37 enemy were killed in that engagement with some accounted for at point-blank range. In these battles the Eland and its devastating 90mm round were decisive in the outcome. Nobody was hurt on the Rhodesian side in any of these engagements. Casualties in the regiment were among the lowest in the army because the guerrilla enemy avoided contact as far as possible. In August 1979, at Sandy Creek north west of Victoria Falls, a single vehicle from troop Tango 22, D Squadron engaged a group of ZIPRA guerrillas attempting a night-time crossing of the border into Rhodesia. Enemy forces covering the crossing, and others waiting to cross, returned fire with mortars, armour piercing 12.75’s and small arms. Despite the initial contact lasting less than two minutes, the crossing was foiled, and 28 enemy bodies were subsequently recovered in mop-up operations on the Rhodesian side of the river in Sandy Creek. Between T22’s return fire and the artillery and mortar fire missions called in by the vehicle commander, 2nd Lieutenant Erasmus, a further 90 plus ZIPRA Guerrillas from Zebra Battalion were accounted for on the Zambian side of the river. This engagement was described by Colonel Ron Reid-Daly, in his book Top Secret War, as the most successful, wholly land based, contact of the bush war. No Rhodesian casualties were sustained in this engagement. Adoption of T-55 tanks Rhodesian T-55 tank parked at Inkomo Barracks, 1979. In October 1979, South African port authorities boarded and seized a French freighter, the Astor, believed to be carrying a shipment of weaponry bound for Angola. The Astor had initially been charged by the Libyan government with the delivery of arms, primarily ten T-55LD tanks of Polish origin from Tripoli's surplus stocks, to Uganda. The tanks, including assorted ammunition and spare parts, were to be offloaded at Mombasa, Kenya, and from thence transported overland. By October the Astor's crew had already rounded the Cape of Good Hope but received belated news of Uganda's defeat in the Uganda–Tanzania War, and new orders to reroute their cargo to an unknown Angolan port. The freighter abruptly changed course; upon its unexpected return to South African waters, however, it aroused suspicion and was impounded in Durban. South Africa confiscated all ten T-55s under the pretext that she was effectively at war with Angola at the time, retaining two for evaluation purposes. The remaining eight were offered as aid to the Rhodesian Army, which assigned them to a newly designated \\"E\\" Squadron, Rhodesian Armoured Corps. It was intentionally leaked to the press that the tanks had been captured in Mozambique, and for several months the T-55s were driven around the country on transporters, giving the impression that Rhodesia possessed a much larger number. Personnel assigned to \\"E\\" Squadron were trained by South African tank crews, who also modified each T-55 with an improved communications system adopted from the Eland Mk7 and anti-infrared paint. Radios were eventually removed from the loader's position and reinstalled near the vehicle commander.Operation Quartz - Rhodesia 1980 The first intake of T-55 crews were recruited only from Rhodesian Army regulars and assigned to a Bundeswehr veteran, Captain Rolf Kaufeld, who was well versed in tank warfare. Despite their deployment in anticipation of potential ceasefire violations during Rhodesia's general elections in 1980, the tanks remained untested in combat. Structure Patterned after its British and South African counterparts, the Rhodesian Armoured Corps was generally organised along NATO lines. There were five squadrons (companies); each squadron had four troops – including attached signals, training, maintenance, and headquarters personnel. In 1979, a fifth troop – support infantry – was added. Due to the size of the Rhodesian Army and its reserve-dependent status, three of the squadrons were manned by reservists and only active for incremental periods. The fourth squadron was permanently staffed by a rotating cadre of regular officers and national servicemen. All squadrons could muster over 300 members for active duty. At one time, RhACR's ranks swelled to up to 500 troops in five squadrons, commanding 60 Eland armoured cars, 50 UR-416 personnel carriers, 20 Daimler Ferret scout cars, and a plethora of improvised fighting vehicles. In 1979 an inventory of 8 Polish-built Soviet T-55LD tanks was also disclosed. It was leaked to the press that these had been captured from Mozambique during a cross-border raid, but they were in fact part of an impounded Libyan arms shipment destined for Uganda. The tanks, diverted to Angola upon the fall of Idi Amin, were impounded by South African port authorities and subsequently donated to Rhodesia.http://www.rhodesia.nl/briefhi1.htm In the 1960s standard armour of the period was the Ferret, a pre-independence contribution from the British Forces Aden. Although 30 Ferrets had once been maintained by the Southern Rhodesian Armoured Regiment some of these were passed on to other successor states after the breakup of the Federation. The Rhodesian Light Infantry only inherited 10 examples in varying states of disrepair and was forced to restore them. Even older American T17E1 Staghounds of World War II vintage were also salvaged from a pending scrapyard.Support Commando 1st Battalion, The Rhodesian Light Infantry RhACR's stratagems reflected the regiment's experience on Humber and Marmon-Herrington armoured cars during the North Africa Campaign, as well as the training many Rhodesian crews had received from their British instructors during the Aden Emergency. However, as the Rhodesian Bush War intensified, Salisbury adopted elements of Israeli mechanised doctrine – particularly those which emphasised light cavalry movements behind enemy lines. RhACR tactics came to revolve around mobility, speed, and swift aggression. Although maligned by age and further deteriorating as a result of hard use and the difficulty in obtaining spares from the United Kingdom, Ferrets continued to be employed for counter- insurgency operations and protective duties. Equipped with a single heavy machine gun, Browning medium machine guns, or a 20mm Hispano-Suiza HS.820 anti-aircraft gun, they were retrofitted with new motors and larger fuel tanks. RhACR units also used MAP-45 and MAP-75 armoured personnel carriers, which, although lightly armed and armoured, provided excellent protection for their embarked infantry sections against land mines. Local manufacturers either converted an older chassis into a MAP or created an entirely new one, installing engines stripped from a menagerie of imported commercial vehicles. In 1976 rumours of T-34 and T-54 tanks in neighbouring Mozambique – where the Rhodesian security forces were increasingly being drawn into external operations against Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), caused a stir, prompting the formation of tank-killer teams. Infantrymen were trained in the use of ageing M20 bazookas while the artillery corps rigged M40 recoilless rifles to Unimog trucks for engaging heavy armour. The Unimog crews worked in pairs to counter the likelihood of retaliatory fire, due in part to the M40's backblast which served to highlight the gunner's position. As the Ferret's firepower was limited, Eland Mk4 armoured cars were also imported in quantity. A South African variant of the French Panhard AML, the Eland was frequently utilised for fire support and anti-tank duties. It was armed with a 90mm cannon capable of destroying a T-34 at medium range, enabling the smaller armoured cars to punch well above their weight during conventional engagements.Mobile firepower for contingency operations: Emerging concepts for US light armour forces The Rhodesians favoured wheeled, lightly protected, vehicles like the Ferret, Eland, and MAP series of personnel carriers because of their operational range and simplicity. Nearly all the RhACR's support vehicles deployed during the war shared these characteristics, including the ubiquitous Mine Protected Combat Vehicle. The limited exception were Rhodesia's T-55s, which were never deployed operationally. After 1976 insurgent and allied forces in Zambia and Mozambique fielded T-54/55 and T-34 MBTs, BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 reconnaissance vehicles, and BTR-152 and BTR-60 APCs. These often boasted heavier armour, more lethal main armament, better armour-piercing ammunition, and better fire control than the Eland and other assorted vehicles pressed into anti-tank duty by the regiment. RhACR recognised this threat by restructuring itself for conventional warfare accordingly and joining with the Rhodesian African Rifles in 1980 to create its first combined arms battalion. Orders of dress The regiment was allegedly given the nickname 'The Black Devils' by the insurgents, reflecting the black tank-suits and leather jackets worn by some of the more highly spirited D Squadron members. These were introduced by Darryl Winkler in an effort to engender an esprit de corps within his squadron – and echoed the all-black look of the British Royal Tank Regiment. In the operational area the majority of the soldiers of the regiment wore one-piece tank uniforms and peaked field caps with neck flaps. On base, standard Rhodesian camouflage was worn with a black beret, fitted with the sable badge illustrated on this page. 'T' Troop wore the Corps of Signals badge. The fitter section wore the Army Service Corps badge. All badges were underpinned by the maroon and yellow regimental colours on an enameled plaque. The stable belt was red with the unfortunate inclusion of two yellow stripes, for which members were sometimes mocked. Thus, the olive-green webbing belt was worn in preference by many members.

Apollinare. He also studied at the Royal University in Perugia, from where he obtained a doctoral degree in politics. Yu was ordained to the priesthood on 22 December 1928 by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica, and then taught at the Urbaniana University until 1933, when he returned to China. Upon his return, he was named National Director of Catholic Action, secretary of the Chinese nunciature, and Inspector General of Catholic schools in China. On 17 July 1936, Yu was appointed Apostolic Vicar of Nanking and Titular Bishop of Sozusa in Palaestina by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 20 from Archbishop Mario Zanin, with Bishops Simon Tchu, SJ, and Paul Montaigne, CM, serving as co-consecrators, in Beijing. In 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army took Nanking and a reward of $100,000 was placed for the capture of Yu, who spent World War II in the United States.

He was one of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek's closest advisors, and on the brink of McCarthyism, Archbishop Yü Pin made claims against Americans he thought were pro-Communist that turned out not to be true.

Biography  He was born in Szeged, Hungary on November 2, 1922. Sebők gave his first solo piano recital at age 11. At 14, he played Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 under conductor Ferenc Fricsay—a performance upon which he would reflect many years later. He enrolled in the Franz Liszt Academy at the age of 16, under the guidance of Zoltán Kodály and Leo Weiner. After graduating, he gave concertsJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.51. . for ten years throughout Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. He won the Grand Prix du Disque in 1957. Sebők was listed in Who's Who in America, Who's Who in Music, the National Register of Prominent Americans, and other biographical dictionaries. He received numerous honors, including the Cross of Merit of the Hungarian Government, La Medaille de la Ville de Paris, Echelon Vermeille, and, in 1996, Kulturpreis des Staates Wallis, (Prix de Consecration). Also in 1996, the French Government bestowed on him the decoration Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.  Teaching  In 1949, he was named professor of music at the Béla Bartók Conservatory in Budapest. After the Hungarian revolt of 1956, he settled in Paris. Encouraged by his friend János Starker, at the age of forty, he went to Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington, starting what is considered to be the most productive phase of his career. Starker and Sebők frequently performed together. Sebők was a guest professor of the Berlin Hochschule der Kunste (HDK) in Germany, there teaching master classes twice a year. He was also an honorary life member of Tokyo's Toho School of Music, and a regular guest teacher at the Banff Centre for Arts; the Amsterdam Sweelinck Conservatorium, the School of Music in Barcelona, and the Hochschule für Musik in Stuttgart. In 1974 he founded and organized annual summer master classes in Ernen, Switzerland for pianists and 'other instruments'. He also founded and directed the \\"Festival der Zukunft\\" in Ernen in 1987, which is to this day carrying his legacy with growing numbers of concertgoers. The city's officials made him an honorary citizen—only their third in 800 years.  Quotes  Prior to a 1985 recital at IU's Musical Arts Center, Sebők looked back on his concert at age 14, and drew a connection between that event and his teaching philosophy. \\"During the third movement I made some mistakes,\\" he recalled, \\"but I didn't feel guilty about it because I felt I had done my best. We had a neighbor, a music lover, who said to my grandfather about my performance, 'Oh, that was wonderful, but in the third movement something went wrong.' My grandfather became very angry with him and said, 'I don't care, because the sun has spots, too.' That was a beautiful thing for my grandfather to say, I think, and sometimes I remember that: Even the sun has spots.\\" Similarly, Sebők helped his students overcome fear of mistakes in order to give their best performances.

An author of novels, short stories, poems, and essays, he earned international recognition as an author dealing with the plight of the poor and with social protest. Biography Fabián Dobles was born in San Antonio de Belén, but his father, a medical doctor who had trained in the United States, soon resettled the family in the rural town of Atenas, in the province of Alajuela. The father was a very strict and devout Catholic and had intended that his son Fabían prepare for the priesthood, but a series of incidents, which he would later fictionalize in his last novel, Los años, pequeños días (\\"Years Like Brief Days\\"), led Fabián to abandon that career path and to study law at the University of Costa Rica. At an early age, he saw some of his poetry published in Joaquín García Monge's influential literary magazine Repertorio Americano (\\"American Repertoire\\"). Dobles was active in left-wing political causes, eventually becoming a leading figure within the Communist Party of Costa Rica. He worked in the legal department of the state's Child Welfare Agency and later in the Social Security Administration's division for savings and subsidies. Following the defeat of the government, to which the communists were allied, in the Costa Rican Civil War of 1949, the Communist Party was outlawed and Dobles spent time in prison. After his release, he had difficulty obtaining employment and over the years worked delivering milk, weaving blankets, and as an administrator for a lumber depot and for a door and window manufacturer. An attempt to participate in the 1957 election as the presidential candidate for the \\"Socialist Party\\" was scuttled by the authorities. Dobles eventually found work as an English teacher at the Liceo de Costa Rica, and as a professor of social work at the University of Costa Rica. He was also a correspondent for Novosti, the Soviet international press agency, and for Prensa Latina, a news agency organized by Cuban government. He also worked for the Costa Rican state publisher (Editorial Costa Rica), eventually becoming one of its directors. Over the course of his career, Dobles published eighteen books, including eight novels, seven collections of short stories, and three tomes of poetry. For his literary production, he was awarded the Magón Prize by the Costa Rican government, the nation's highest award for cultural work, in 1968. Some of the short stories in the collection Historias de Tata Mundo (\\"Tales of Daddy World\\") were anthologized by UNESCO and translated into several languages. The University of Costa Rica published his complete works in five volumes in 1993. Except for his last novel, Los años, pequeños días, which is autobiographical, most of Dobles's literary work concerns the struggle for subsistence of simple peasants in rural Costa Rica, or else, notably in Ese que llaman pueblo, the plight of the urban poor. Most of this work could be classified as coming under the heading of social realism. Fabián Dobles married Cecilia Trejos in 1942 and the couple had five daughters. He died in his home in San Isidro de Heredia, at the age of 79. Works * \\"Years Like Brief Days\\" translated by Joan Henry References *Ann B.

Although he is popular on campus, he finds himself at odds with Bob McAndrew (Ralph Bushman), a studious, reserved boy who becomes his chief rival for the affections of beautiful Mary Abbott (Mary Brian), a professor's daughter. Tom rooms with Jim Doolittle (Jack Pickford), an awkward weakling but goodhearted backwoods youth who idolizes him. The brash and cocky Brown easily wins over his dormitory mates, but refuses to let them ostracize Jim. One night at a party, Tom forcibly kisses Mary, which initiates a fight with Bob. Afterwards, Tom challenges Bob to a rowing competition; Bob is stroker on the college rowing team. Tom ends up losing. When he forces a confession of love from Mary, he begins to drink in shame. When he replaces Bob in a match against Yale, Tom collapses and is disgraced. He is persuaded by his father to go out for football. To save his friend's reputation, the sickly Jim goes out and takes his place in the rain and is soon hospitalized. Tom plays in the game against Yale and at a crucial point gives Bob a chance to score for the team. After the game, Tom goes to the hospital to tell Jim of the victory, but Jim dies shortly afterward. Tom is acclaimed a school hero and is happily united with Mary.

The 1904 disaster started as a thunderstorm in Tula region. It travelled northward, passing through eastern suburbs of Moscow into Yaroslavl region. When the cloud approached remote Moscow suburbs, it formed three tornado funnels, destroying suburban settlements and Lefortovo district within the city itself. Contemporary reports The main tornado was recorded by thousands of witnesses in Moscow, but few outside of the city. The Dean of Sukhanovo church reported that the cloud passed some 18 kilometers west from his town, through the villages of Kapotnya (200 homes destroyed), Chagino (65 out of 67 homes) and Khokhlovka; all three of these settlements are now within Moscow city limits. Nearer suburbs of Lyublino and Karacharovo were completely demolished too. Many witnesses in Moscow, including the journalist Vladimir Gilyarovsky, report the same picture of the advancing storm: an unusual black cloud, 15–20 kilometers wide, advanced from south-east at estimated 25 meters per second (no instrumental wind readings were made). The tornado was preceded by a hailstorm and a sudden drop in temperature. Two black funnels, one from the sky, the other from the ground, merged into a wide tornado with a yellow fire-like light in the middle. Witnesses mistook this light for an explosion at some oil tanks that, indeed, were close to the path of tornado, but were spared from destruction. The tornado broke into the city proper in Lefortovo District, destroying the freight yard of the Kursk railroad, then shaving off the Annenhof Forest – an old, neglected park in Lefortovo (north of the present-day Aviamotornaya subway station). It passed through the Lefortovo barracks, tearing roofs from masonry buildings, passed over the Basmanny District into Sokolniki Park and left the city in a northward direction. Apparently, the tornado faded away, thus destruction in the densely populated Basmanny was far less than in Lefortovo. Present-day assessment Modern scientists rate the 1904 tornadoes at F2–F3 in the Fujita scale. Total damage is estimated at 3,000 single-family homes (Razuvaev), while the loss of life was not properly counted (Gilyarovsky reported seeing only one dead). The disaster occurred in the middle of the Russo-Japanese War, and clearing the rubble and counting the bodies was not a top priority; police reports and formal damage assessments were not published due to war-time censorship. Many of the victims are presumed to be squatters in suburban parks and the Annenhof Forest, which was cleared of fallen trees years after the incident. Other tornadoes Other tornadoes were recorded in 1945 in Moscow and in 1951, 1956, 1970, 1971, 1984 (during the tornado outbreak of 9 June), 1987, 1994, and 1997 in Moscow Oblast 100 km south-east from Moscow (near Zaraysk). Another was seen in June 2009 near Sergiyev Posad. References Works cited *V.Razuvaev. Weather in Russia, 20th century *V. A. Gilyarovsky, The Hurricane *V. A.

A theatre which has been developed by FHODS from what used to be a church, for all types of performances. The society includes a very active Youth Section who perform three shows a year and meet at the Tower Theatre. History The Folkestone Dramatic & Music Club was formed in 1902, performing at the Woodward Institute. This was later changed to the Folkestone Operatic Society in 1913 performing at the Pleasure Gardens Theatre. The society closed for the duration of World War I (1914–1918), then continued to present plays up until World War II (1939–1945) when it closed once more. In 1947 Hythe was added to the name and the society held productions at the Leas Pavilion Theatre, Folkestone Town Hall, and Chichester Hall in Sandgate. In 1952 FHODS acquired its own premises and developed the 57-seat Ham Yard Theatre. In 1963 a small former church was acquired in Sandgate and developed into the Little Theatre, Sandgate, as the central FHODS location during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Having outgrown the site, FHODS sought larger premises. The Tower Theatre, purchased in 2001, seats 270 patrons. Youth Section FHODS Youth Section caters for young people aged between 12 and 21 who are interested any aspects of theatre. They meet every Sunday at the Tower Theatre. They put on 3 shows a year: *The Brigadier Thomas Competition - held in spring, \\"the Brig\\" consists of a collection of one act plays (usually four) written, directed and performed by Youth Section members based around a common theme.

It is native to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay,, p. 101 but is now naturalized in Florida, Colombia, South Africa, and Mauritius.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesBiota of North America Program Description Habranthus robustus are relatively large rain lilies. They grow from ovate to obovate bulbs around in diameter. They bear solitary lavender to pale pink, funnel- shaped flowers, long, held at a slight angle on scapes, with a leaf-like bract long at the base. Flowers typically appear after rain from late summer to early fall and are followed by large deep green leaves, measuring wide and long. Taxonomy and nomenclature H. robustus from Florida. H. robustus have declineate slightly asymmetrical flowers. Habranthus robustus belongs to the genus Habranthus (rain lilies) of the tribe Hippeastreae. It is classified under the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). In broader classifications, they are sometimes included within the lily family (Liliaceae). It was formerly classified under the genus Zephyranthes as Zephyranthes robusta, a name still used incorrectly by merchants and hobbyists. Habranthus robustus is commonly known as the 'pink fairy lily', 'pink rain lily', 'pink zephyr lily', 'pink magic lily', 'pink fawn lily', and 'Colombiaanse mini-amaryllis'. It is known as cebollita in Spanish. Habranthus robustus are commonly sold as Zephyranthes robusta by merchants, an incorrect synonym. Due to having the same common names, it is also frequently confused with other 'pink rain lilies' - namely Zephyranthes rosea and Zephyranthes carinata (also sold under the name Zephyranthes grandiflora). The three species are often mislabeled, but H. robustus is easily recognizable from the other two by its larger, more strongly bent (and often asymmetrical), paler pink flowers. H. robustus also have leaves covered with a fine grayish waxy coating (glaucous) in contrast to the leaves of Z. carinata. Distribution and habitat Habranthus robustus is believed to have originated from Rio Grande do Sul of Brazil. It is native to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, and is widely naturalized elsewhere. Cultivation and uses Habranthus robustus is widely grown as an ornamental. It is one of the most prolific of the summer flowering rain lilies.They are propagated by dividing the bulbs (including offsets) and from seed. They aren't as tolerant of colder temperatures as other rain lilies. Chemical composition The plant contains some toxic compounds like lycorine. Other compound include galanthamine, 3-epimacronine, hippeastidine, lycoramine, galanthine, haemanthamine, haemanthidine, hamayne, tazettine, vittatine, 11-hydroxy vittatine, 8-O-demethylmaritidine. Toxicity Similar to the closely related species of Zephyranthes, H. robustus contains toxic alkaloids. Mainly galanthamine-type alkaloids which can be lethal for humans.

Capital is supplied through the business finance market in the form of bank loans and overdrafts; leasing and hire-purchase arrangements; equity/corporate bond issues; venture capital or private equity; asset-based finance such as factoring and invoice discounting, and government funding in the form of grants or loans.  Importance  The economic and banking importance of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is well recognized in academic and policy literature. It is also acknowledged that these actors in the economy may be under-served, especially in terms of finance. This has led to significant debate on the best methods to serve this sector. Although there have been numerous schemes and programmes in different economic environments, there are a number of distinctive recurring approaches to SME finance.Adapted from: * Collateral based lending offered by traditional banks and finance companies is usually made up of a combination of asset-based lending, contribution based finance, invoice discounting and factoring based finance, using reliable debtors or contracts. * Information based lending usually incorporates financial statement lending, credit scoring, and relationship lending. * Viability based financing is especially associated with venture capital. * Reliable for all the small ticket loan * The entity type not depending on the value of the business.  Gap  A substantial portion of the SME sector may not have the security required for conventional collateral based bank lending, nor high enough returns to attract formal venture capitalists and other risk investors. In addition, markets may be characterized by deficient information (limiting the effectiveness of financial statement-based lending and credit scoring). This has led to claims of an \\"SME finance gap\\" or Nano gapEquicapita - Who Will Buy Boomer SMEs?– particularly in emerging economies. At a workshop hosted by The Network for Governance, Entrepreneurship & Development (GE&D;) in Geneva in July 2008, SMEs that fall into this category have been defined as Small Growing Businesses (SGBs). There have been at least two distinctive approaches to try to overcome the so-called SME finance gap. The first has been to broaden the collateral based approach by encouraging bank lenders to finance SMEs with insufficient collateral. This might be done through an external party providing the collateral or guarantees required. Unfortunately, such schemes are counter to basic free market principles, and they tend to be unsustainable. This sector is increasingly called the Meso-finance sector. However, there are no evidence of any significant structural barriers to the supply of bank or private equity finance to suitable SME applicants on mutually satisfactory terms and conditions in Britain. The main obstacles to funding here appear to be on the demand rather than the supply side of the business finance market. This is mainly in the form of: * Lack of satisfactory business plans, accounting and other information; * Inadequate assets for use as security; and, * Insufficiently high levels of profitability, gearing, liquidity, stability, and other business-financial performance criteria on the part of funding applicants.The Business Finance Market: A Survey, Industrial Systems Research Publications, op.cit., page 57. Thus, the second approach has been to broaden the viability based approach. Since the viability based approach is concerned with the business itself, the aim has been to provide better general business development assistance to reduce risk and increase returns. This often entails a detailed review and assistance with the business plan. A common aim or feature of the viability based approach is the provision of appropriate finance that is tailored to the cash flows of the SME. Although the returns generated by this approach in less developed countries may not be attractive to venture capitalists, they can be significantly better than conventional collateral based lending – whilst at the same time being less risky than the typical venture capitalist business. Thus, a new, distinct asset class, offering a new avenue for diversification, is available to investors. With higher profitability than traditional SME finance and lower risk than traditional venture capital, this sector has been named the \\"growth finance sector\\". In the past, a significant obstacle to applying this approach in less developed countries has been getting the information required to assess viability, plus the costs of transferring and providing business development assistance. However, in the last several years, improved information and communications technology have made the process easier and cheaper. As technology and information sharing continue to improve, the approach could become significantly more cost-effective and attractive to established financiers with viability based approaches, and to consultants providing business development assistance to SMEs in other, more mainstream areas. Some investors have promoted this approach as a means of achieving wider social benefits, while others have been interested in developing it largely in order to generate better financial-economic returns for shareholders, investors, employees, and clients. A new organisation, Aspen Network for Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), has been created to bring the growth finance stakeholders together, with the view to evolve into an association serving the sector, similar to what venture capital or microfinance associations do. They have declared their target audience to be Small Growing Businesses. In 2008, a group of financial service providers and other stakeholders came together to form the Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade (FAST). FAST is an association of financial service providers explicitly committed to improving access to finance for sustainable SMEs—defined as SMEs that are compliant with one or more of a host of growing sustainability standards (such as organics, fair trade, forest stewardship council etc.).  The management of business lending  The effective management of lending to SMEs can contribute significantly to the overall growth and profitability of banks. There has been considerable research and analysis into the methods by which banks assess and monitor business loans, manage business financing risks, and price their products – and how these methods might be further developed and improved. There has been particularly intensive scrutiny of the kinds of business financial information that banks use in making lending decisions, and how reliable that information actually is. Banks have traditionally relied on a combination of documentary sources of information, interviews and visits, and the personal knowledge and expertise of managers in assessing and monitoring business loans. However, when assessing comparatively small and straightforward business credit applications, banks may largely rely on standardized credit scoring techniques (quantifying such things as the characteristics, assets, and cash flows of businesses/owners). Using such techniques – and also centralizing or rationalizing business-banking operations generally – can significantly reduce processing costs. Standardized computer-based assessment may also be more accurate and fairer than reliance on the personal judgments of local bank managers. As a result, banks may now be able to offer more loans, faster and in larger amounts, and reduce previously high security requirements. However, business lending as a whole is substantially more diverse and complex than personal and residential mortgage lending. This, coupled with the large size and inherently risky nature of many business loans, tend to limit the scope and desirability of computerized credit scoring in assessment and monitoring.The Management of Business Lending: A Survey, ISR/Google Books, 2002, page 39.

They wrote, with Steven Izenour, a report in 1972 on the subject entitled Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form. This report, and its thesis that Las Vegas showed the way for architecture in the late 20th century, drew the attention of the architectural world to the city. A quarter of a century later, for a BBC program (a segment of The Late Show entitled \\"Virtually Las Vegas\\" broadcast on BBC Two on 1995-01-16) Venturi and Scott Brown revisited the city, and revised their opinions. Initial thesis View north along Las Vegas Boulevard directed towards Fremont Street intersection (photographed by Charles O'Rear in May 1972 for DOCUMERICA) In the 1970s, Venturi et al. observed that the city had then been structured around the automotive culture that was dominant at the time, with all of the buildings oriented towards the highway. It was the norm for buildings to have \\"rhetorical front and conventional behind\\", in other words a decorated façade visible from the highway but a less decorative aspect where not visible. The casinos and motels also sported ground-level parking at the front, between the building and the highway, a feature that Venturi considered to be distinctive. They also drew a contrast between the artificially lit and air conditioned interiors of the buildings and the heat and glare of the \\"agoraphobic auto- scaled desert\\" outside. The mixture of styles, ranging from what they termed \\"Miami Moroccan\\" to \\"Yamasaki Bernini cum Roman Orgiastic\\" , they did not view as chaotic but rather as a necessary result of Las Vegas as one of what they termed \\"the world's 'pleasure zones'\\" alongside the likes of Marienbad, the Alhambra, Disneyland, and Xanadu and its positioning as a place where a visitor with an ordinary life could indulge in escapist notions of being \\"a centurion at Caesar's Palace, a ranger at The Frontier, or a jetsetter at the Riviera\\" for a few days. 1990s revision Large video sign in Las Vegas displaying an error message (2012) In the 1990s, Venturi and Scott Brown observed that the automotive-driven architecture of the 1960s had been transformed into a more pedestrianized form, in part as a result of the growth in visitors that it had experienced over the years. The distinctive neon lighting, that in the 1960s had had Venturi et al. talking of Vegas as a city of signs, had been replaced by giant television screens, which Venturi bemoaned. In their original book, and in the later 1977 revised edition, they had focussed upon characterizing Vegas in terms of how most if not all built objects in the (then) city in one way or another functioned as signage. In the 1990s, Mark C. Taylor opined that the similarities between Disney and Las Vegas that Venturi et al. had touched upon in the 1970s had grown immensely over the years, with much of the urban space being thematized and devoted to fantasies upon fantasies and \\"worlds within worlds\\". He observed that this architectural link to Disney had even been made concrete, with the MGM Grand Hotel directly mimicking (albeit with some differences) the original Walt Disney World. Taylor also observed the replacement of neon with the televisual, to create a vast visual space in which \\"the virtual becomes real and the real becomes virtual\\". As an example of this he propounded new Fremont Street, where \\"city planners have converted the train terminal that was inspired by the glass architecture of Parisian arcades, into a computer terminal\\", with a canopy comprising 1.4 million computer-controlled lights and lasers.

Karate Budokan International was founded in 1966 by Chew Choo Soot in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. Founder Chew Choo Soot was born in Alor Star, a Northern State of Peninsula, Malaysia, on 7 February 1922. As an infant, his father died and so he was brought up under the strict discipline of his grandfather, an elderly Confucian scholar who believed in education through books and not in martial arts. At 15 years of age, Chew became very interested in weight lifting and enrolled for training at a small body building club in Ipoh. Due to his dedication and training, he became the national Malaysian weight lifting champion in both the feather weight and the light weight classes in 1939, 1941 and 1942. During those years he also acquired an interest in martial arts and took up judo, jujitsu and wrestling. Aged 20, Chew was introduced to Karate-Do, during the Japanese occupation of Malaya. He was then contracted by a Japanese military officer, who had seen him in health and strength magazines, to become a personal fitness and weight lifting coach. During one of his scheduled visits, the young Chew discovered the officer practicing movements which we now know to be karate ‘Kata’. The styles of karate practiced by the officer were Keishinkan and Shotokan. Chew was impressed and asked for tuition, which the officer agreed to. For more than 2 years afterwards, they spent the evenings training together in karate, jujitsu, judo and weight lifting until the Japanese Army officer left for Okinawa in 1945. After the end of the Second World War, Chew went to Japan and Okinawa to further his karate training, as well as several trips to Taiwan to learn kung-fu and oriental weapons from a number of old kung-fu Masters of China. In 1966 at the request of his friends, Chew then decided to start a dojo at Petaling Jaya with a small number of students and Karate Budokan International was first founded as a lesser organisation. There was a large amount of interest shown by people who wanted to learn karate, which became so great that he found it impossible to cope with the classes without seeking assistant instructors. As there were no other karate instructors in Malaysia, he then made two further trips to Tokyo and Osaka and employed 7 Japanese instructors to assist him to conduct the karate classes. These classes had then spread the art to the North and South of the Peninsula within 2 years. Chew's ambition was to be able to travel to different countries and conduct karate classes when he reached the age of 80. However, he fell ill from a paralytic attack on 4 February 1995 and died, in Malaysia, on 18 July 1997 at the age of 76 years.History of Mr. Chew Choo Soot (All India Budokan Karate Federation) aibkf.comHistory of Karate Budokan International (Hawkesbury Martial Arts) hmakarate.com  Global Expansion  KBI logo Karate Budokan International is now a global association with branches around the world including Australia, India, Israel, Germany, Malaysia, Pakistan, Norway, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Cameroon, Wales and England.

It was heavily damaged during World War II and it has been slowly rebuilt since. History Because of its geographical location it has been an important settlement in the area since the Iron Age. The development of the settlement reached its peak in the Romanesque period, although Gothic elements in architecture have also been preserved. During World War II the village served as a smaller base for the German occupation units, and was heavily damaged during the Allied bombing at the end of the war. After the war it was gradually renovated. After the war, a notable resident of the village was the graphic artist Lojze Spacal. Landmarks Prophet Daniel Parish Church Castle The castle of Štanjel was built in the Middle Ages, its final reconstruction which remains up to this day was made at the end of the 17th century by the Counts of Cobenzl.

The Mangala area consists of over 16 separate oil and gas fields of which the majority of the reserves are located in the three fields of Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya. The Mangala Area sits in Barmer Basin and is thought to contain oil in place volumes of , of which are thought to be recoverable. Cairn India is the operator of the field, a subsidiary of Vedanta Group. Field participation history Royal Dutch Shell won the licensing round for Block RJ-ON-90-1 in 1992 from the Indian Government, entering into a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with them. In 1998, Royal Dutch Shell sunk a well in the area and put a logging tool probe (which detects hydrocarbons) down the bore. However, the electronic readings came up negative. A worker for Cairn Energy at the site (which then held a 10% stake in the leasehold) noticed that the probe was actually dripping in oil. \\\\- This was later found to be oil from the calibration run, inserted to the well at ground level to test the logging tool. 27% of this contract was then sold to Cairn Energy in 1998 in return for covering some historical costs and drilling the next exploration well. Cairn's stake increased to 50% in 1999 by offering in exchange to fund the second exploration well. Subsequently, Cairn purchased 40% of Shell's leaseholding and the remaining 50% in 2002 for $7.25 million. $100 million was spent by Cairn Energy on wells. In January 2004, 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent was found in Mangala, making it 2004's biggest discovery of on-shore oil in the world. In 2005 the national Indian oil company ONGC exercised their right as part of the terms of the PSC to acquire a 30% stake in the two larger fields discovered to date. The company retains this option on all further discoveries in the block. 2006 saw a restructuring of Cairn Energy into three companies, Cairn Energy, Cairn India and Capricorn Energy. Block RJ-ON-90-1 was included in the assets of Cairn India, which was floated on the Indian stock market in the same year, raising almost $2 billion. Reservoir properties Despite containing a massive of in-situ oil, the recovery factor for the field is roughly around 30%, giving it reserves of approximately . This level of recovery is a result of the properties of the oil rather than to do with the geological settings of the reservoir which can often hamper recovery factors. The oil has an API gravity of between 25 and 30, which makes it slightly heavier than Brent Crude at 38 API. However, more importantly, the oil is very waxy. This waxiness causes it to be a solid at room temperature (20 °C, which is much lower than typical daytime temperatures of Mangala). Brent crude typically has a pour point at 3 °C while Mangala oil has a pour point of 42 °C. To assist with increasing the recovery factor, two types of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are being evaluated which could increase the recovery by up to 25%. The less riskier and costly of them would be to undertake a Polymer flood instead of a traditional water flood. This is strategy is not very dependent on the oil price, well location or extensive testing. The other option is to undertake Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer flooding (ASP). ASP flooding would be riskier in terms of costs, well spacing, development time (five years), and would be more sensitive to the oil price. However, the rewards for it are significantly higher, potentially increasing the incremental reserves by 25% when compared to polymer or water flooding. Exploration and development Cairn (and previously Shell) have drilled 184 wells during the exploration stage, of which 22 were discoveries, the most significant being the Mangala discovery well which confirmed the field's large reserves. The well intersected two separate reservoirs with a total oil column of 320 meters. Cairn India expects to drill in excess of 100 wells developing the fields in the Mangala Area. First production was scheduled to begin in 2007; however, this has thought to have slipped to 2009 due to the tight oil market for equipment and services. Peak production was expected to plateau at . It is now expected to be 250,000 barrels per day. India-based Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) has given nod for its $560m project to improve oil recovery at Mangala oilfield in Rajasthan.

Clay Walls This novel about an immigrant family and their life in California from the 1910s to the 1940s. It is divided into three parts: The first focuses on the mother, the aristocratic Haesu; the second, on the father, Chun, who is from a farming background; and the third on their American-born daughter, Faye. Chun and Haesu had fled to the United States after Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, but find their relationship difficult in the States, due partly to American racial discrimination but due also to the class differences between them. Haesu grows more involved with the immigrant community's work for the Korean independence movement and dislikes Chun's patriarchal attitudes; but Chun feels that Haesu cannot adapt to their new situation and that she doesn't appreciate his work supporting the family. While Haesu and their children visit Korea, Chun loses the family business; he becomes addicted to gambling, abandons the family and eventually is found dead in Nevada. Haesu takes a job to support her family and eventually sells off a piece of land in Korea she was using to connect her to Korea. Faye grows up knowing only the States; her brothers and male friends join the military after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and at the end of the novel, she is being courted by a Korean medical student from Yale. Kim began the novel after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1976 and based it partly on the experiences of her parents: her father came from a peasant background and her mother was an aristocrat who participated in the Korean-independence movement in the States. The novel focuses both on key aspects of Korean- American life during World War II (including living conditions, Korean nationalism and the government's mistaken treatment of Koreans as \\"Japanese citizens\\" after Pearl Harbor) and on the asymmetry of race, gender and class relationships in both Korean and U.S. cultures.

Its author, Josh Fruhlinger, is a freelance writer and editor based in Los Angeles. Fruhlinger, formerly based in Baltimore, also writes about editorial cartoons for the website Wonkette in a weekly feature called Cartoon Violence. He also contributes to a Wikipedia-themed humor blog called Citation Needed. Content For each blog post, Fruhlinger selects two to eight comic strips for comment, usually focused on topics such as poor artwork, inappropriate coloring, nonsensical plots, and sexual subtext or innuendo. Long-running soap opera-style comic strips such as Apartment 3-G, Mark Trail, and Mary Worth bear the brunt of Fruhlinger's humor, an emphasis that he attributes to their being \\"[the] perfect targets for the sort of metatextual detached irony that is our generation’s terrible contribution to Western civilization.\\" Fruhlinger's blog also features commentary on long- running legacy cartoons like Family Circus and B.C. Weekly \\"metaposts\\" update readers on notable events in Fruhlinger's life, such as his July 22, 2008, appearance on the game show Jeopardy!, offer critical commentary on the comic strip industry, and include a \\"Comment Of The Week\\" that highlights the best comments posted by the blog's readers. The blog's original name was \\"Josh Reads the Comics so You Don't Have To\\", which is reflected in the site URL, joshreads.com. Impact The Comics Curmudgeon was among the blogs criticizing what they deemed was the declining quality of the Canadian family strip For Better or For Worse, and who were noted for \\"harsh attacks\\" on creator Lynn Johnston. Humorist John Hodgman, in a review of comic-strip reprint collections, said the website \\"regularly ridicules the creaky war horses like Hagar the Horrible [sic] and Mary Worth, the opaque woolgathering of Ziggy, the dull crypto-evangelism of B.C.\\" A blog contributor's July 21, 2008, post broke the news that a recent Blondie strip had been recycled almost verbatim from one published in 1952. This was followed in March 2009 with a similar report of strip recycling in Family Circus. Hägar the Horrible's cartoonist Chris Browne,Chris Brown of Hägar the Horrible responds to CC Liō artist/writer Mark Tatulli, and Sally Forth scripter Francesco Marciuliano.Francesco Marciuliano of Sally Forth links to the CC in his blog, calling it \\"America's Finest Website\\" have commented on the blog. Bob Weber Jr., artist for Slylock Fox, created merchandise for the Curmudgeon CafePress store with original art of the character Cassandra Cat (from the Fox strip). On December 18, 2008, the comic strip Archie began occasionally referencing the blog's recurring \\"Archie Joke-Generating Laugh Unit 3000\\" joke, in which the strip is allegedly written by a sentient computer program which continually tries (but fails) to understand genuine human interaction. On August 12, 2009, writer and illustrator Stephan Pastis mentioned The Comics Curmudgeon by name in his comic strip Pearls Before Swine, in the context of satirizing internet criticism.http://joshreads.com/?p=3759, retrieved on 2009-08-12 On May 6, 2012, the comic strip Crock introduced a character named \\"Freerloiter\\" (an apparent parody of Fruhlinger's name) who lost all of his artistic talent after a lobotomy. However, Commander Crock \\"pulled the plug\\" on Freerloiter after he announced his intention to move to Baltimore and start a comics blog. Fruhlinger responded on his blog: \\"Of course, if you aren’t me or part of the fairly small slice of the comics-reading public who also reads my blog, this strip would make exactly zero sense to you. Just another Sunday Crock, in other words.\\" Crock concluded publishing new strips two weeks later. Awards The Comics Curmudgeon was ranked 13th on PC Magazine's 100 Favorite Blogs list for 2007, and Elite Choice named it one of 2007's Top 125 Elite Blogs (judged on traffic generation, Alexa ranking and other measures of visibility).

Seiter (June 10, 1890 – July 26, 1964) was an American film director. Life and career Seiter was born in New York City. After attending Hudson River Military Academy, Seiter broke into films in 1915 as a bit player at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, doubling as a cowboy. He graduated to director in 1918. At Universal Studios in the mid-1920s, Seiter was principal director of the popular Reginald Denny vehicles, most of which co-starred Seiter's then wife Laura La Plante (his second wife was actress Marian Nixon). This period also included The Beautiful and Damned and The Family Secret. In the early talkie era, Seiter helped nurture the talents of RKO's comedy duo Wheeler & Woolsey in such rollicking features as Caught Plastered (1931) and Diplomaniacs (1933). He also directed Laurel and Hardy in Sons of the Desert (1933), generally regarded as one of their best feature films. Seiter's other films include Sunny, Going Wild, Kiss Me Again, Hot Saturday, Way Back Home, Girl Crazy, Rafter Romance, Roberta, Room Service, Susannah of the Mounties, Allegheny Uprising, You Were Never Lovelier, Up in Central Park, One Touch of Venus. Among the many stars directed by Seiter during his long career were Shirley Temple, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Jack Haley, Deanna Durbin, Jean Arthur, John Wayne, Fred MacMurray, Lucille Ball, Rita Hayworth and the Marx Brothers. As a director, on occasion, if he ran into friction from his star—as was the case with Lou Costello in 1946's Little Giant—Seiter would get even by adhering religiously to the script, refusing to add any nuance or creativity to the project (this pettiness may have been the reason that one prominent actress of the 1930s referred to Seiter as the most unimaginative director she'd ever worked with). On his final four films, before he retired in 1954, Seiter functioned as both producer and director. These films included The Lady Wants Mink (1953), a gentle satire of the then topical \\"raise your own coat\\" craze. He died in Beverly Hills, California, of a heart attack, aged 74. Seiter was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. His grandson, with Nixon, is screenwriter Ted Griffin. Most of the films Seiter directed with the Wheeler/Woolsey duo have been released on two DVDs by Warner Archive.

The series was produced and directed by Dennis Goulden.  History  In 1955, NBC forced Westinghouse Broadcasting to trade its NBC-affiliated Philadelphia station WPTZ-TV to NBC in exchange for WNBK-TV in Cleveland. In 1965, NBC was forced to reverse the trade on orders from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Justice Department. When NBC regained control of the Cleveland station, it renamed it WKYC-TV and moved several shows from Philadelphia to Cleveland. One of these was the documentary series Montage, and Goulden became executive producer of the show.The Plain Dealer, February 11, 1968 Montage profiled local personalities, such as the director of the Cleveland Orchestra Lorin Maazel and Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown, and national ones such as Olympic skater Jo Jo Starbuck and Oscar-nominated actor William Gargan. It also looked at national issues with a local perspective. Pollution, race, homosexuality, drugs, crime, housing, education, medical advancements, the Vietnam War, and many other issues were examined. Some shows had guest hosts, including Bill Cosby and Robert Stack. The Montage unit traveled to Australia, Asia, Europe, and South America to pursue stories. These shows were often broadcast on the other NBC owned-and-operated stations, PBS stations, and others. In 1976, the show experimented with a magazine format for several of the shows.The Plain Dealer, November 22, 1976 Goulden produced the show until 1978, when the show was cancelled. During that time over 300 episodes were produced. The show won dozens of Emmys and dozens more nominations, and hundreds of other awards.

He was of one the first to conduct missionary activities in southeastern Africa (modern-day Malawi) and was known for baptizing Malawi's first president, Hastings Banda when Banda was his student from 1908 to 1914. Biography Prentice was born in 1871 at Mid-Greenwell, near Carnwath in Lanarkshire to James and Christine Prentice (née Elder). His father worked as a farmer and owned 58 acres of land while his mother died in 1876. He spent his childhood living with his five brothers and sisters at Craigen House, Carnwath. He moved to Edinburgh and was a medical student at the University of Edinburgh. Three years later, he was qualified as a doctor at the university and obtained a licentiate from both Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1894. He was ordained as a minister in 1894 by the Old Free Church of Scotland and moved to Africa to conduct missionary activities. Prentice worked with Dr. Robert Scott, a Scottish when he first settled in Africa. In 1897, during his Africa's journey, he toured the northern parts of Luangwa valley, making contact with Senga people who lived in large stockaded villages surrounded by thorn trees and visited Kamanga and seeing evidence of the Swahili dwellings among the Bisa. According to an 1898 British Medical Registration record, he stayed at Loudon, Nyasaland. Record also indicated that Prentice was in Kasungu in 1897 but had travelled to Bandawe. He opened seven schools in Kasungu after spending time there since 1897. He also established the Chilanga missionary station and was appointed head of the mission in October 1900 during his time in Kasungu. During World War I, he joined as a Captain with the Column 3/1 King's African Rifles and was later transferred to Column 4/1 as a medical officer. On 19 May 1917, he was appointed as temporary Captain with the Nyasaland Field Force. On 12 February 1924, Prentice arrived in London from Beira, Mozambique on board the Royal Mail Ship of HMHS Goorkha. Later on 12 August 1927, he departed from London for Biera on a Royal Mail Ship Electrician. He returned to Scotland in 1924 and spent time staying in Kennetpans, Clackmannan until somewhere around 1931. During the 1930s and 1940s, he stayed at Fort Jameson, During his time at Fort Jameson, George farmed tobacco on the farm named Nchere Hill in Northern Rhodesia (modern-day Zambia) and died there in 1948. He was buried at Aylmer May Cemetery, Rhodes Park, Lusaka. Family Prentice married Agnes Tudhope Scott on 10 May 1900 at the St Michael and All Angels Cathedral in Blantyre, Nyasaland. The couple had four children: * Margaret Christina Prentice - born in 1902, at Kasungu, Nyasaland and 1903 British General Medical Registration for lists him as being at Kasungu, Ngara, British Central Africa * Isabel Agnes Scott Prentice - born on 26 Feb 1906 at The Orchard, Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, Scotland. George was present at the birth and presumably on leave from the Kasungu Mission in Nyasaland. Her British General Medical Council registration for 1907 gives his address as being Kasungu, Ngara, British Central Africa (source: Scotlands People and British Medical Registers). She died later on 17 January 1916 at the Royal Scottish Nursing Home in Edinburgh from acute peritonitis. * James Scott Prentice - born in 1908 at Kasungu, Nyasaland * Robert Scott Prentice - born on 30 July 1910 at Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, Scotland. His birth was registered and witnessed by a nurse which probably means that George was not in Scotland but had remained in Nyasaland.

Олег Басилашвили, один из самых парадоксальных актёров нашего времени — какой он в жизни? // 1tv.ru (18 сентября 2013 года) His father made up a humorous story that his grandfather had once arrested a dangerous criminal, named Dzhugashvili, who was really Joseph Stalin. In reality Basilashvili's maternal grandfather was a Russian orthodox priest and an architect, who participated in the construction of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. During the World War II young Oleg Basilashvili was evacuated from Moscow to the Transcaucasian republic of Georgia. There young Basilashvili went to a primary school and lived with his paternal grandfather until the end of World War II.«Я — кухонная партнёрша Басилашвили». Галина Мшанская дала «Смене» интервью накануне 70-летия своего мужа — народного артиста СССР Олега Басилашвили. // smena.ru (24 сентября 2004 года) Acting career In 1956 Oleg Basilashvili graduated from the Acting School of the Moscow Art Theatre (MkHAT), where he had studied under Pavel Massalsky. His group was one of the most talented: among his group mates there was Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, Mikhail Kozakov and Tatiana Doronina, his first wife. He made his film debut as a young groom in film Nevesta (aka The Bride, 1956) by director Grigori Nikulin based on a story by Anton Chekhov. At that time together with his first wife, Tatiana Doronina, Basilashvili joined the troupe at the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in Leningrad under the leadership of the legendary director Georgi Tovstonogov. Since 1959 Basilashvili has been a permanent member of the troupe at the BDT in St. Petersburg. There his stage partners were such stars as Kirill Lavrov, Tatyana Doronina, Alisa Freindlich, Lyudmila Makarova, Svetlana Kryuchkova, Zinaida Sharko, Valentina Kovel, Innokenti Smoktunovsky, Oleg Borisov, Pavel Luspekayev, Sergei Yursky, and many other remarkable Russian actors. Basilashvili's most memorable stage works were in the play Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekhov, Kholstomer based on the eponymous story of Leo Tolstoy, The Lower Depths by Maxim Gorky, and other classic plays directed by Georgi Tovstonogov at the BDT in St. Petersburg. Film career Oleg Basilashvili shot to fame with his roles in films by director Eldar Ryazanov.«Ирония судьбы»: о тех, кто не попал в фильм They collaborated in such popular films as Office Romance (1977), Station for Two (1982), Promised Heaven (1991), and Prediction (1993), which became significant box-office hits. Among Basilashvili's film partners were such actors as Alisa Freindlich, Lyudmila Gurchenko, Nikita Mikhalkov, Nonna Mordyukova, Evgeni Leonov, and Natalya Gundareva, among many other Soviet/Russian film actors. His most acclaimed film role was made in collaboration with director Georgi Daneliya in the remarkable Autumn Marathon (1979). The film is a cross-genre comedy and melodrama with a bitter humor and satire of the Soviet life. In it Basilashvili plays a man in his mid-life crisis, who is torn between two nice women, his wife and his mistress, and all three of them become entangled in the game of lies and personal demands, being at the same time strangled by the stagnant Soviet reality. Basilashvili co- created a memorable acting ensemble with such actors, as Natalya Gundareva, Evgeni Leonov, Marina Neyolova, and Nikolai Kryuchkov. The film became a Soviet classic, and was awarded at International film festivals in Berlin and San Sebastián. In the 1980s he appeared in eccentric films by Karen Shakhnazarov. Those were Kurer (Courier) (1987), Gorod Zero (Zero City) (1988), and Sny (Dreams) (1993). Dreams, a wild comedy about Perestroika is especially remarkable: in it Basilashvili tried on several images, those of a noble count from the past, a pornographer and a rock star. In 2001 Oleg Basilashvili starred in Karen Shakhnazarov's comedy Yady, ili vsemirnaya istoriya otravleniy (Poisons or the World History of Poisoning) (2001). The actor performed both as pensioner Prohorov and the Pope Alexander VI Borgia in it. Among the actor's other works of the early 21st century one can mention the role of Prof. Fyodorov in the historical film The Romanovs: A Crowned Family (2000) and General Yepanchin in the TV series The Idiot (2003) directed by Vladimir Bortko after the famous novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Eventually he became a member of the pro-democratic group of representatives in the Russian Parliament, and a supporter of such politicians as Anatoly Sobchak and the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Oleg Basilashvili was a strong proponent of returning the original name to the city of St. Petersburg. He quit politics after 2000, and focused on his acting career. Comeback After a few years of his artistic hiatus, Oleg Basilashvili made a comeback with an impressive performance as Woland in the TV miniseries The Master and Margarita (2005), an adaptation of the eponymous novel of Mikhail Bulgakov by director Vladimir Bortko. In his own words, Basilashvili played the character of Woland in resemblance of an authoritarian and manipulative bureaucrat, alluding to a Soviet-era dictator. Basilashvili created a powerful interplay with a stellar ensemble of actors, such as Aleksandr Abdulov, Kirill Lavrov, Anna Kovalchuk, Aleksandr Galibin, Aleksandr Filippenko, and other notable Russian actors. Recognition Oleg Basilashvili was designated People's Artist of the USSR (1984). He was awarded the State Prize and was decorated by the Russian government. * Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1979) * Order of Merit for the Fatherland: **3rd class (5 February 2009) - for outstanding contribution to the development of domestic theatrical art and many years of fruitful activityУказ Президента Российской Федерации от 5 февраля 2009 года № 117 «О награждении государственными наградами Российской Федерации работников Федерального государственного учреждения культуры \\"Российский государственный академический большой драматический театр имени Г.

Because the heat inside the body is too high for sperm to survive, an undescended testicle is non-functional. The condition is most often discussed in the horse world, as the health behavioral issues surrounding adult males with the condition are of concern to owners and handlers of such animals. Dogs In dogs, the toy and miniature breeds are considered more susceptible. The testicles usually descend by the time a puppy is 40 days old. In horses Although the rate that testicles descend varies between individual animals, horses over three years with the condition are generally castrated. Surgery called a cryptorchidectomy is used to remove the retained testicle, but different procedures are used, depending on the location inside the body cavity. An undescended testicle is not a serious or life-threatening condition, though it may cause the animal discomfort at times. This condition can be corrected by surgery to place the testicle in the correct position, but most ridglings are gelded to remove the testicle altogether. When a male horse thought to be a gelding exhibits aggressive or sexual behavior, cryptorchidism is suspected. Sometimes, a horse with an unknown medical history is actually a stallion with both testicles retained. An alternate definition of ridgling is a partially castrated horse. This can occur when a ridgling is gelded, but the retained testicle is not removed, resulting in an incomplete castration. Such animals may exhibit sexual behavior similar to intact males, either because the undescended testicle eventually dropped into the scrotum after the castration procedure or because the retained testicle may still produce some hormones. Retained testicles in such cases generally are removed. There are blood tests that can determine if a horse is producing male hormones, though these do not detect a ridgling if hormone levels are too low. Palpation sometimes can detect a retained testicle, but is also of uneven reliability. There are also cases where true geldings exhibit aggressive or stallion-like behavior, sometimes called \\"false rigs\\", but their behavior is not hormone-driven and can sometimes be corrected with proper training and discipline. The condition is considered heritable, but a genetic link has yet to be proven. Horses of any breed may be ridgelings, but Quarter Horses, Saddlebreds, Percherons, and ponies seem to be more likely to exhibit the condition. In dogs, the toy and miniature breeds are considered more susceptible. As a young male animal reaches puberty, the testicles, which originally were inside the abdominal cavity, move down the inguinal canal to the scrotum. In a ridgling, either the testicles fail to descend, or they are trapped behind the external inguinal ring and cannot emerge. Usually both testicles in a horse have descended by the age of 16 months, but as many as 15% of all two- and three-year-old male horses may have a retained testicle. An example of a ridgeling that was gelded was the Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide. While the horse was gelded because the undescended testicle caused him noticeable discomfort and his manners also improved after castration, his success in horse racing has led to considerable discussion over whether it would have been better to opt for surgically correcting the condition instead. A number of notable racehorse stallions were ridglings, including Honor Code, A.P. Indy and Slew o’ Gold. Owners of a prized animal may opt for surgery to preserve the value of a horse as a breeding stallion. There is debate over whether to remove the undescended testicle in a stallion; some people believe it causes discomfort to the animal, others disagree. Proponents of surgery note that it is low-risk, and the undescended testicle is non-functional, and it can be removed with laparoscopy or a very small incision. Some stallions show improved behavior and athletic performance when the non-functional testicle is removed. Such animals are sometimes called monorchids due to having only one testicle, but usually are fertile.

His father was an innkeeper. He was educated at Felsted. Cooke arrived in London in 1722 and began working as a writer for the Whig causes. He associated with Thomas Tickell, Ambrose Philips, Leonard Welsted, Richard Steele, and John Dennis. Cooke is the source of one of the primary biographies of John Dennis, which he wrote in Latin. Battles with Alexander Pope Cooke did a great deal of first-rate translation from Latin and ancient Greek. His first publication was an elegy on the death of the highly contentious Marlborough in 1722. He followed that with a masque entitled Albion in 1724. His most famous production was The Battle of the Poets in 1725. This was a reworking of the trope of Le Lutrin that had been used by Jonathan Swift in The Battle of the Books. Where Swift had had classical authors and Tory authors sweeping the field of their whig and modern commentators, Cooke had \\"moderns\\" and whig authors defeating Alexander Pope and other \\"tory\\" authors. That same year, he published an essay in the Daily Journal examining the Thersites section of Pope's Iliad which showed many faults of translation. In 1726, he wrote The Bath, or, The Knights of the Bath. In 1728, Cooke demonstrated his command of Greek with the first translation of Hesiod into English, and he became known as \\"Hesiod Cooke.\\" The same year, he wrote an opera with John Mottley entitled Penelope. Pope, therefore, developed a character of Cooke for Dunciad. Cooke heard about this and wrote two letters of apology. He appeared in Dunciad anyway. In response, Cooke reissued The Battle of the Poets and the Daily Journal essay in 1729 in his Tales, Epistles, Odes, Fables, &c.; He also wrote several letters for the London Journal in 1729–1730 and issued those as a book dedicated to Horace Walpole (son of the divisive prime minister) in 1731. Pope took another jab at Cooke in his Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot in 1735 (l. 146). Terence and Cicero Aside from his entry into the controversies with Pope, Cooke continued to publish. He produced an edition of Andrew Marvell's poems. In 1731, he published The Triumphs of Love and Honour, with a long essay on the usefulness of the English stage. Later, he wrote a book of Odes, a Life of King Edward III of England in 1734, and essays for the Weekly Oracle on Phalaris. In 1734, he produced a three-volume translation of the plays of Terence, and in 1737 an edition of Cicero's De natura deorum with an extensive critical apparatus. Also in 1737, he produced a play based on Terence called The Eunuch. Two years later, he wrote and published a play called The Mournful Nuptials which was not acted until 1743 (as Love the Cause and Cure of Grief). In 1741, he produced a partial translation of Virgil, with notes. In 1742, Cooke took part in Colley Cibber's fight over control of the theaters. He wrote The Bays Miscellany, or, Colley Triumphant. He also wrote dialog for the mute plays of John Rich and Cibber's Harlequin. In 1744, he adapted his Le Lutrin piece as The Battle of the Poets as a one-act play to be inserted into Henry Fielding's Tom Thumb. Finally, in 1754, he produced a single volume of a planned series of the works of Plautus. He had gathered up an enormous subscription (713 names) for the publication, and this, in fact, furnished his living expenses. Money troubles Cooke was always short of funds and wrote to pay the bills. He was also decidedly political. In 1741 he edited an edition of The Craftsman, Bolingbroke's journal. In 1748, he was brought up on a libel charge for criticism he made of the Pelham administration. The same year, he also wrote a public letter encouraging religious toleration. He died in poverty on 29 December 1756, leaving a wife named Anne and a daughter named Elizabeth. Elizabeth died two years later, in a workhouse.

Historically the residence of the Pilecki, Lubomirski and Potocki families, the complex includes a number of buildings and is surrounded by a park. The castle is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated September 1, 2005, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Owners In the second half of the 14th century, the land was the property of the Toporczyk family, who built a wooden castle on the hill. In the 16th century the castle belonged to Stadnicki family. Since the 17th century, the property was in the hands of the Lubomirski family, and then the Potocki family until 1944. History The castle was originally built in the second half of the 16th century, but was later modernised into a palace-residence by its owners. It was once home to two greatest Polish families – first, until 1816, the Lubomirski family, and later – until 1944 – the Potocki clan. The orangery and fortifications Italian garden The history of Łańcut is much older than the castle erected in 1642. It goes back to the times of King Casimir III the Great, who founded here a town in accordance with the Magdeburg Rights in the 14th century. At the time Łańcut was owned by the Pilecki family, who had connections with the royal Jagiellonian Dynasty. The head of the family, Otton Pilecki, was a close friend of the king and his wife, Jadwiga, became the godmother to the future successor, Władysław II Jagiełło (1352-1434). Later the connections were strengthened with their daughter Elżbieta's marriage to the king. Władysław II Jagiełło is believed to have visited Łańcut twice. Between World War I and World War II, the local townspeople still pointed to a lime tree growing on a hill, a former site of the Pilecki's wooden fortified mansion, where the king was believed to have relaxed with his third wife Elżbieta. After the Pilecki clan has died out, Łańcut became the property of the Stadnicki family. The most famous of them was Stanisław, the governor of Sigulda. Stadnicki extended and modernised the castle in 1610 during the reign of Sigismund III. In 1629, Łańcut became the property of Stanisław Lubomirski, governor of Ruthenia and Count of Wiśnicz, who in 1647 became the prince of the Holy Roman Empire. It was Lubomirski who erected, according to Maciej Trapola's design, the quadrilateral castle with corner donjons surrounded by fortifications. Other traces of Lubomirski's restructuring include parts of the castle fortification, presumably the work of Krzysztof Mieroszewski (1600-1679). During the Swedish invasion of Poland, in 1656, the castle was visited by King John II Casimir (1609-1672). In 1657, it was unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedish ally, George II Rákóczi. In the late 17th century, after the 1688 fire, the castle was restored by Tylman van Gameren, a Dutch-born Polish architect and engineer who, at the age of 28, settled in Poland and worked for wealthy magnates. Tylman left behind a lifelong legacy of buildings that are regarded as gems of Polish Baroque architecture. In Łańcut he transformed the former castle into a palace, simultaneously adding bulbous cupolas to the side towers, which are the most characteristic aspect of the castle's architecture. The baroque palazzo in fortezza in Łańcut underwent its first radical alterations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Its owners at the time were Duke Stanisław Lubomirski (1722–1782) and his wife Izabela née Czartoryska. Initial transformations were conducted by the Lubomirskis together and after her husband's death in 1783, the Duchess continued the work by herself. She also began to expand the complex and, being a great admirer of baroque architecture, continued to transform the castle into a palace. Historical casino which once was part of the estate Gloriette of the Łańcut Castle Following Izabela's death in 1816, Łańcut was inherited by her grandchildren and members of the Potocki family. For the next one hundred years, the castle became the centre of their hereditary family estate, legally established in 1830. The consecutive generations of the Potocki's introduced various levels of modernisation both in the castle itself and its immediate and more distant surrounding. The Duchess’ grandson and heir, conducted some repairs in the castle, but most importantly he erected a complex of horse- riding facilities consisting of stables and three carriage houses The most radical changes in the estate and the whole surrounding, were introduced during the times of the Duchess’ great-great-grandson – Roman Potocki, who married Elżbieta née Radziwiłł. They carried out a major overhaul and rearrangement of the large Łańcut estate, at the same time providing the 17th- century structure with electricity, water pipes, sewers, and central airflow heating. In 1880 the castle also received a telephone connection with the hunters’ palace in Julin, located several kilometres away. Roman and Elżbieta Potocki hired a French architect, Amand Louis Bauqué, and a graphic designer Albert Pio, who worked on new stylistic transformations and arrangement of the residence. The old Neo-Gothic decorations on the castle frontage were replaced by the Neo-Baroque ornamentation. The most radical changes were introduced in the horse-riding complex, dating from the first half of the 19th century. Only the manege was left unchanged. However the classicist stable houses were demolished and replaced with new, Neo-Baroque stables designed by Bauqué. Ten years later, in 1902, the new carriage house with a large harnessing hall was built. Nowadays Łańcut Castle is one the most famous aristocratic residences in Poland. It continues to fascinate with its impressive architecture, magnificent interiors and rich art collections. Surrounded with a spacious and enchanting park, it is a place transformed into a museum, which most fully shows the royal splendour of aristocratic households, the charm of the world which in Poland was ended by the Second World War and its political outcome. Styles and interior The Great Dining Room inside the castle Artists and architects who worked in Łańcut incorporated a variety of styles in the architecture of the castle. The lush classicist stucco works, which can still be seen today were made by Fryderyk Bauman. Apart from classicist, also rococo and Neo-Gothic decorative elements were created. Some made clear reference to the Orient and pre-romantic trends. The castle also received an impressive collection of paintings and sculptures purchased mainly during numerous trips made by the couple and later by the Duchess, who was very creative and constantly looking for artistic inspirations. In fact, even today, in spite of all the later alterations and modernisations, the castle largely retains the character which it received in the course of the few decades, until Duchess Izabela Lubomirska's death in 1816. The castle's interior features several rooms designed for her. For instance, on the ground floor, the oriental style of the Turkish Apartment was arranged in the old 17th-century vaulted chambers; the refined elegance of the View Room decorated with arabesques; and the intimacy of the Brenna Apartment which looks like a white-green vanity box. The reception rooms created on the first floor constitute several sequences. Private suites in the northern wing consist of bedrooms, dressing rooms and two salons. One of them, called the Mirror Salon, is ornamented with a valuable rococo boiserie featuring magnificent polychrome wood-carvings depicting symbols of the four seasons. One of the chambers decorated with paintings and chandeliers The statue of Bacchus on the panther The palace's collection of historical carriages The bedroom and another salon, which later received the name Boucher Salon, are classicist rooms which were specially designed for the Duchess, and both feature magnificent wood-carved overdoors. The bedroom walls are decorated with colorful fabric featuring the pattern described in an old inventory as “flames and flowers”. It also forms a baldachin over the bed. The material which can be seen today is the third version of the design. The first one, made of silk and dating from the times of the Duchess, was taken off the walls in the late 19th century by her great- grandson, and replaced with a replica made in Lyon. That was taken off the walls in 1944 by the last estate owner who evacuated the movables. After the castle was turned into a museum, the decoration was replaced by a classicist style fabric featuring the pattern of vertical pink and cream stripes. The one on display today was reconstructed in the 1990s, its colours and pattern being a copy of the fabric made in Lyon, based on the preserved parts of the original. The only difference is that the pattern is not woven but printed on the pink background. Another first-floor apartment, consisting of a salon, bedroom and bathroom, is the Chinese Apartment. It features a lowered ceiling, and combines classicist elements and far eastern patterns, with classicist and English furniture in a Chinese style. On the first floor, we can also see a complex of classicist reception rooms created for the Duchess, among those the most noteworthy two-storey Ballroom, ornamented with honey-coloured, polished wood carvings, and white engravings in the overdoor and frieze parts, all by Bauman; the Great Dining Room and chapel were all designed by Chrystian Piotr Aigner and Bauman. The southern corridor, which is accessed from the Ballroom, features the most sophisticated painted ornaments. The Duchess had the walls and ceiling decorated with illusionist design, which transformed the interior into a gazebo located amongst ruins, overgrown with grapevine and hollyhocks. The scenery of the corridor was used by the Duchess as a background for a gallery displaying her collection of sculptures, both antique and 18th-century replicas. A similar function has the Columned Salon, located to the east of the Sculpture Gallery. Inside, among two rows of ionic columns, imitating a placement of a pagan god, only one sculpture is displayed. It is a portrait sculpture depicting Henryk, the beloved pupil of Duchess Lubomirska, presented as the ancient god Eros by Antonio Canova. Following the Duchess’ wish, in the castle's closest proximity Aigner build the library pavilion, and in cooperation with Bauman who supplied rich stucco ornaments, the classicist orangery, and the gloriette on the north-western bastion. A little further, outside the moat, the Small Romantic Castle, featuring classicist structure, with elements of Neo-Gothic, was erected. Park and gardens Park surrounding the castle The castle is surrounded by a spacious and enchanting park of the early English Landscape style. Shape of the park was created in the second half of the 18th century and at the beginning of the 19th century, when it belonged to Stanisław Lubomirski. Duchess Izabela, the wife of Stanisław Lubomirski, was personally inspecting and taking care of gardens, orangery and the park. The park is about 36 hectares and is divided into an internal park, surrounded by a moat, and an external park. The greatest attraction in the park is the Orchid House, where visitors can admire a wonderful collection of orchids which used to be the highlight of the place. Town Outside the museum park, although in the castle's proximity, stand imposing villas and former tenements for the estate employees. The town parish church in Łańcut is also connected with the castle, as it was founded by the estate owners. The splendid Potocki family crypt constructed beneath the church was eventually used as their burial ground. Additionally, in the former farms which were part of the estate before 1944, visitors can see numerous well-preserved objects marked with the Potocki family's emblem, or with the owners’ initials. Those include estate guard posts, granaries, cow barns, stables, and sheepfolds as well as the whole complex of the estate forest management in the village of Dąbrówki several kilometres away from Łańcut.

Route description SR 661 travels through northern Licking County and southern Knox County. No portion of this state route is included within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History The SR 661 designation was created in 1937. It was originally routed along its current path between Granville, at the eastern intersection with Broadway Avenue, the former routing of SR 16, and the southern end of Mount Vernon. However, instead of turning east onto Blackjack Road, as it does now, it continued north along Granville Road up to where it meets SR 13 just south of downtown Mount Vernon. That point marked the original northern terminus of SR 661. By 1964, a new freeway opened to the south of Granville. SR 16 was re-routed off of Broadway Avenue onto the by-pass. Consequently, SR 661 was extended a short distance to the south by following Broadway Avenue west to Main Street, and then heading south along the former routing of SR 37 to the interchange with the SR 16/SR 37 freeway that currently marks the southern terminus of SR 661.

Competing in two Winter Olympics, he won the gold medal in the men's doubles event at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck along with Manfred Stengl. Feistmantl also won five medals in the men's singles event at the FIL World Luge Championships with one gold (1969 - the first Worlds to be held on an artificial track, at Königssee), two silvers (1959, 1970), and two bronzes (1967, 1971). He also won two medals in the men's doubles event at the FIL European Luge Championships with one gold (1967) and one silver (1962). After his 1969 World Championship win, he donated the medal to the Polish team after their luger Stanisław Paczka had been killed whilst in competition at the Championships: Feistmantl stated that he \\"wanted to set a positive example\\". That year the International Olympic Committee awarded him a Fair Play Prize for his gesture. At the opening ceremonies of the 1976 Winter Olympics, Feistmantl and fellow Austrian alpine skier Christl Haas were lighters of separate Olympic Flames as defined by Innsbruck's hosting of their second Winter Olympics. He subsequently cited this as his fondest memory. Feistmantl was inducted into the International Luge Federation Hall of Fame in 2005 along with Hans Rinn.

The book was noted in 2020 as having been very similar to the Coronavirus outbreak, especially given London wrote it at a time when the world was not as quickly connected by travel as it is today. Plot summary The story takes place in 2073, sixty years after an uncontrollable epidemic, the Red Death,Evening Standard; Back to the future again; November 10, 2008 has depopulated the planet. James Smith is one of the survivors of the era before the scarlet plague hit and is still left alive in the San Francisco area, and he travels with his grandsons Edwin, Hoo-Hoo, and Hare-Lip. His grandsons are young and live as primeval hunter- gatherers in a heavily depopulated world. Their intellect is limited, as are their language abilities. Edwin asks Smith, whom they call \\"Granser\\", to tell them of the disease alternately referred to as scarlet plague, scarlet death, or red death. Smith recounts the story of his life before the plague, when he was an English professor. In 2013, the year after \\"Morgan the Fifth was appointed President of the United States by the Board of Magnates\\", the disease came about and spread rapidly. Sufferers would turn scarlet, particularly on the face, and become numb in their lower extremities. Victims usually died within 30 minutes of first seeing symptoms. Despite the public's trust in doctors and scientists, no cure is found, and those who attempted to do so were also killed by the disease. The grandsons question Smith's belief in \\"germs\\" causing the illness because they cannot be seen. Smith witnesses his first victim of the scarlet plague while teaching when a young woman's face turns scarlet. She dies quickly, and a panic soon overtakes the campus. He returns home but his family refuses to join him because they fear he is infected. Soon, an epidemic overtakes the area and residents begin rioting and killing one another. Smith meets with colleagues at his college's chemistry building, where they hope to wait out the problem. They soon realize they must move elsewhere for safety and begin trekking northward. Shortly, Smith's entire party dies out and he is left as the sole survivor. He lives for three years on his own with the company of a pony and two dogs. Eventually, his need for social interaction compels him back to the San Francisco area in search of other people. He finally discovers a sort of new society has been created with a few survivors, who have broken into tribes. Smith worries that he is the last to remember the times before the plague. He reminisces about the quality of food, social classes, his job, and technology. As he realizes his time grows short, he tries to impart the value of knowledge and wisdom to his grandsons. His efforts are in vain, however, as the children ridicule his recollections of the past, which sound totally unbelievable to them. Publication history The Scarlet Plague was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries The Scarlet Plague was written in 1910 but not serialized until the May–June 1912 issue of London Magazine. It was published as a book in 1915 by Macmillan. London published The Scarlet Plague in book form at a point in his career that biographers and critics have called a \\"professional decline\\", from September 1912 to May 1916. In this period, he stopped writing short works and shifted to longer works including The Abysmal Brute (1913), John Barleycorn (1913), The Mutiny of the Elsinore (1914), The Star Rover (1915), among others.Reesman, Jeanne Campbell. Jack London's Racial Lives: A Critical Biography. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2009: 267. The Scarlet Plague was later reprinted in the February 1949 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries.London, Jack (1949). «The Scarlet Plage». Famous Fantastic Mysteries, v. 10, n. 3, pp. 93-118. Retrieval on May 4, 2020. Jack London was inspired in part by Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 short story \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\".Hammond, J. R. An Edgar Allan Poe Companion: A Guide to the Short Stories, Romances and Essays. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, 1981: 78. Both Poe's story and London's fall into a genre of apocalyptic fiction featuring a universal plague that nearly wipes out humanity. Other examples include Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826), George R.

Situated in a bend of the Cluden Water, at its confluence with the River Nith, the ruins are on the site of the Bailey of the very early Lincluden Castle, as are those of the later Lincluden Tower. This religious house was founded circa 1160 and was used for various purposes, until its abandonment around 1700. The remaining ruins are protected as a scheduled monument. Etymology The name Lincluden has a Brittonic origin. The second element derives from the nearby Cluden Water. The first element may be Brittonic *lann (Welsh llan, 'parish'), or *linn, \\"pool, lake\\" (Welsh llyn). Priory of Lincluden Foundation The foundation of the priory is accredited to Uchtred (d.1174) who had co-ruled Galloway with his brother Gille Brigte. Uchtred did not have the benefit of the relative peace of his father's reign in Galloway. Fergus of Galloway (d.1161) had founded such establishments such as Soulseat Abbey, St Mary's Isle Priory, Dundrennan Abbey, the foundation at Kirkcudbright (Kirk of St. Cuthbert) and re- established the foundation at Whithorn, the historic community of St Ninian. Uchtred's focus of power was in eastern Galloway, while his brother's was in the west. Their reigns were marked by turbulent relationships between themselves, the Irish Kings of Ailech, the King of Scots, William the Lyon, and the King of England, Henry II. Lincluden was the only monastic house that Uchtred would found, meeting his death at the hand of his brother in 1174.Chronicles of Lincluden, Chap. 1 Prior to the foundation of Lincluden, there had been only been houses of Monks in Galloway, Uchtred's new house was the first nunnery within the Lordship. The first intake of religieuses were probably Cluniac sisters from France or England, later being supplemented by local novices. Douglas Patronage In the late 14th century the area became part of the fief of Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway, and latterly 3rd Earl of Douglas. Using claims that the nuns at Lincluden had reputedly broken their vows of chastity and were guilty of licentious behaviour, of which there was no proof , Douglas with an eye on the revenues from the priory, sat in judgement over them and found them guilty.MacDowall, p 51 He dismissed the nuns from the priory. Perhaps penitent at the expulsion of the nuns, Earl Archibald ordered the construction of a new church, and set up a College consisting of a Provost and twelve Canons.Fraser, vol I p349 Following the capture of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas at Battle of Homildon Hill, and his later capture at the Battle of Shrewsbury, the Earl spent some time as a prisoner of Henry IV of England where he struck up a friendship with the King. This is evidenced by an open letter of 20 April 1408 from Henry to all his northern castellans. This forbids them, should they enter Scotland for military purposes, from harming or damaging persons or property pertaining to the College of Lincluden for a period of three years. Earl Archibald and his successors spent a great deal of money on ornamenting the church, and there are many fine armorial carvings still within the ruins. Still extant is the tomb of Princess Margaret, Countess of Douglas and Duchess of Touraine, the daughter of Robert III of Scotland and wife of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas. The buildings survived destruction at the Reformation in 1560. The last Mass was celebrated on Christmas Day 1585, organised by Lord Maxwell.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585–1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 54-5. The last provost, Robert Douglas, left about 1590, ownership then passed to the Catholic Maxwells of Terregles. The collegiate church’s domestic ranges were converted into a tower house, which was abandoned by the late 1600s. Thomas Pennant in his A Tour of Scotland, and Voyage to the Hebrides in 1772 wrote, (of Princess Margaret's tomb ) \\" her bones till lately, were scattered about in a most indecent manner by some wretches who broke open the repository in search of treasure.\\" In 1882 the owner Capt Maxwell of Terregles had the ruins cleaned up and fenced off and a caretaker installed in lodge on site. In 1922 the ruins were taken into state care. In recent years the ruins have again suffered from vandalism. It was reported that used engine oil had been poured over the effigy of Princess Margaret. Following this incident the effigy was removed in 1999 for conservation and protection and replaced with a fibreglass replica. Historic Environment Scotland, Statement of Significance, Lincluden Collegiate Church, page 3, Year of Review 2013.  Robert Burns at Lincluden  Robert Burns visited Lincluden and was inspired to write a song \\" The Minstrel of Lincluden\\", (1794), the first verse of which is:- As I stood by yon roofless tower, /Where the wa'flow'r scents the dewy air,/Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower,/And tells the midnight moon her care. Burns also wrote the song, Ca' the Yowes to the Knowes' at Lincluden. Yonder Clouden's silent towers,/Where, at moonshine's midnight hours,/O'er the dewy-bending flowers,/Fairies dance sae cheery./Ca' the yowes to the knowes.
