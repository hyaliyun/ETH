The core group consists of Jona Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans, and when touring expands to include Bobby Birdman. Yacht has released albums on States Rights Records, Marriage Records, DFA Records, and Downtown Records.  History   Early history  Bechtolt chose the name YACHT in reference to Y.A.C.H.T., an alternative school in Portland, Oregon. Bechtolt told Spin, \\"It stands for Young Americans Challenging High Technology. It refers to an education program that was held in Portland, Oregon. I was enrolled when I was 16, back in 1996.\\"  2002‚Äì2007  YACHT was Bechtolt's solo project from 2002 to 2008. During this period, he released three albums, Super Warren MMIV, Mega and I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real, on record labels in the Pacific Northwest area. In January 2006, YACHT was commissioned for two performances for the New York based art and technology platform Rhizome, as part of its Crap-tops vs Laptops show. In February 2006, YACHT performed at the Museum of Modern Art's P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center and produced an hour-long Internet radio program with Clear Cut Press, a Northwest-based publisher of new literary work. In April 2006, the Aurora Picture Show commissioned a YACHT performance as part of its Media Archeology Festival in Houston, Texas. For the 2007 release of I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real by Marriage Records, Bechtolt performed a concert on an actual yacht on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. In October the same year, YACHT played at one of China's earliest music festivals, Yue, organised by Split Works. Live performances during this period included dancing along to music as well as elaborate PowerPoint presentations.  2008‚Äì2010  Claire L. Evans performing with Yacht in 2009 In 2008, YACHT became a duo with the introduction of longtime collaborator Claire L. Evans as a full member. She contributed vocals to many of the songs on the 2009 album See Mystery Lights, YACHT first full-length release on DFA Records. The album cover was designed by the Texas-based artist Boyd Elder, who had previously designed album art for The Eagles. Pitchfork rated See Mystery Lights an 8.5, calling it \\"a triumph\\", and Rolling Stone wrote that YACHT \\"split the different between Talking Heads and electro pop, and make a breakthrough album of digital ear candy.\\" It was chosen as a \\"Critic's Choice\\" by The New York Times critic Nate Chinen. During this period, YACHT began publicly discussing their personal philosophy, and published a book called The Secret Teachings of the Mystery Lights: A Handbook on Overcoming Humanity and Becoming Your Own God which explained their beliefs, a list of which is maintained on their website. In January 2010, YACHT added a live band, The Straight Gaze, consisting of the musicians Rob \\"Bobby Birdman\\" Kieswetter and Jeffrey Brodsky to their live show. This incarnation is known as YACHT and the Straight Gaze.  2010‚Äì2013  In November 2011, YACHT worked with the Youtuber and longtime YACHT supporter Mitchell Davis on their music video for the song \\"I Walked Alone\\". In June 2011, YACHT released Shangri-La, their second album on DFA Records. They made a double video for its first two singles, \\"Utopia\\" and '\\"Dystopia (The Earth Is on Fire)\\", directed by the experimental filmmaker and documentary maker Rene Daalder. In 2012, they recorded \\"Le Goudron\\", a cover version of the Brigitte Fontaine song (1969). In early 2013, the retailer Kohls used YACHT typeface imagery and lyrics from \\"Shangri-La\\" on a series of T-shirts made available online, until the band notified the company about possible legal liabilities. In an August 2012 interview with New York Music News, Evans explained the YACHT band, business and belief system: \\"YACHT is the name we give to all the projects we do together. Usually that‚Äôs recording and performing music, but as we emphasize in our axiom of \\"band, business, and belief system,\\" there are both materialistic and metaphysical dimensions to our work. It's full-spectrum.\\" In December 2012, the band celebrated its 10th anniversary by releasing the single \\"Second Summer\\". The video was produced by the Fox animation studio, Animation Domination. In August 2013, the band released \\"Party at the NSA,\\" a song satirizing the National Security Agency's unwarranted surveillance of private citizens, and donated all proceeds from sales of the song online to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The comedian Marc Maron plays the guitar solo on the song.Christian Hoard, \\"Yacht feat. Marc Maron 'Party at the NSA'\\", Rolling Stone, August 21, 2013 YACHT and the design blog Nothing Major created a T-shirt of the \\"Party at the NSA\\" artwork, of which sale proceeds were also donated to the EFF.  2014‚Äì2015  In 2014, YACHT signed to Downtown Records, and released an EP, \\"Where Does This Disco\\". To accompany the release, YACHT designed a limited-edition compact disc that served as commentary on the obsolescence of the medium. They discussed the project at WIRED's WIREDxDesign conference in October 2014.Kyle Vanhemert, \\"A Band's Obsessive Ode to the Compact Disc\\", WIRED, December 16, 2014 WIRED called the project \\"music not as a thing in itself, but the beginning of a chain of experiences which had no edge.\\" Cliff Kuang, \\"6 Ideas That Define Design in 2014\\", WIRED, October 7, 2014 On October 16, 2015, YACHT released I Thought The Future Would Be Cooler, their first full-length album on Downtown Records. The release was preceded by a series of technological subversions, including a drone-captured video of a billboard,Zoe Camp, \\"YACHT Announce New Album I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler Via Billboard\\", Pitchfork, July 29, 2015 a website which sent fans faxes of the album artwork,Lizzie Plaugic, \\"YACHT want to send you their new album art by fax\\", The Verge, August 11, 2015 and video that only played when Uber prices were surging in Los Angeles.Evan Minsker, \\"YACHT Premiere 'L.A. Plays Itself' Video in Conjunction With Uber Surge Pricing\\", Pitchfork, September 22, 2015 The campaign was nominated for two Webby Awards. 2016‚Äìpresent On May 9, 2016 it was reported a sex tape with Claire Evans and Jona Bechtolt was leaked and the romantically involved couple responded by admitting to making the tape then saying they are taking some control over distribution by selling it for $5 on their website. It was later revealed that the leak of the sex tape was a hoax designed to promote the band. The duo admitted to the hoax and released a video inspired by combining a sex tape with The X-Files.https://fuck.teamyacht.com/ The stunt was criticized by many media outlets. Lizzie Plaugic wrote for The Verge: \\"By successfully getting news organizations to give coverage to this hoax, they've lent credence to the very real and persistent assumption that victims of sex crimes are doing it only for the attention.\\" Anna Merlan from Jezebel said, \\"What YACHT did is troll people's innate sense of horror, disgust and compassion when confronted with a terribly violating crime. This is one of the grossest publicity stunts I've ever seen.\\" ‚ÄúWe have nothing but regrets about it,‚Äù Claire Evans said about the stunt in 2019. ‚ÄúObviously it was a mistake.\\" After this incident YACHT took time off from music. They co-founded the Triforium Project, an effort to revitalize a piece of \\"polyphonoptic\\" public art in Los Angeles called the Triforium (Los Angeles). They won a major grant to reimagine the artwork with a temporary installation and a series of live performances featuring dozens of Los Angeles-based artists and musicians. YACHT released the album Chain Tripping on August 30, 2019, using artificial intelligence processes to help compose the songs, write lyrics, and create artwork, videos, typography, and press photographs, in collaboration with artists including Ross Goodwin, Allison Parrish, Tom White, and Mario Klingemann, and machine learning researchers. The album was nominated for a GRAMMY Award for Best Immersive Audio Album.

It is based on the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who, and allows roleplayers to adopt the role of characters from that fictional universe. Unlike most RPGs, the rules featured in new editions of the game remain largely unchanged. The updates consist of layout, images, and characters with rules provided. The first edition matched the style of the David Tennant era, the second edition the Matt Smith, the third styled for the programme's fiftieth anniversary with characters and images from Day of the Doctor, while the fourth and most recent edition draws from the first series of the Peter Capaldi era. Beginning with the anniversary edition, the game shifted from the traditional European release format of a box containing dice, tokens, and multiple smaller books towards the American format of a large core rulebook. The first edition core rules box set was released to critical acclaim in the fall of 2009. It has gone on to win two awards including the Grog d'Or for Best Roleplaying Game 2010 and the UK Game Expo Best Roleplaying Game 2010. It was also nominated for the Origins Best Roleplaying Game 2010, the ENnies Product of the Year 2010, the Golden Geek Game of the Year 2010, and the Golden Geek Best Artwork & Presentation 2010. Publication history Cubicle 7 announced the license to Doctor Who in December 2007; the TV series had been cancelled in 1989, but was brought back in 2005 and this was the version of the show that Cubicle 7 had licensed. Author Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"It was a big licence. So big, in fact, that it would totally turn Cubicle 7 on its head.\\" He also noted that \\"The acquisition of the Doctor Who licence was part of a clever plan whereby Angus Abranson and Dominic McDowall-Thomas would take Cubicle 7's existing success and multiply it many times.\\" , three products had been released including the first edition box set, a Game Master's screen, and a box set supplement entitled \\"Aliens and Creatures\\". In October 2012 Cubicle 7 released the Eleventh Doctor Edition of the game, focusing on the Matt Smith era of the show. The Eleventh Doctor Boxed Set box was a two part box, rather than a \\"pizza box\\" style box. The 11th Doctor Boxed Set won the Gold ENnie for Best Family game in 2013 http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/announcing-the-2013-ennie-awards-winners/ Two sourcebooks were released using this edition's layout and style: Defending the Earth, a UNIT sourcebook,http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/hardcopy-defending-the- earth-the-unit-sourcebook/ and The Time Traveller's Companion, an in-depth look at Time Lords and time travel. It was awarded the Silver ENnie for best supplement in the 2013 ENnie Awards.http://www.ennie- awards.com/blog/announcing-the-2013-ennie-awards-winners/ Three PDF-only adventures for the Eleventh Doctor were released in 2013: Cat's Eye, Medicine Man, The Ravens of Despair and a stand-alone version of Arrowdown, the Eleventh Doctor edition's introductory adventure. In May 2013 Cubicle 7 began releasing a series of supplements, one for each of the Doctor's incarnations,http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/doctor-who-aitas/the-doctors- sourcebooks/ starting with The First Doctor Sourcebook.http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/the-first-doctor-sourcebook-in-stores- this-week/ As of 2018, the first eleven Doctors have had sourcebooks published in both hardback and PDF format, with a sourcebook for the Twelfth Doctor planned for release at an unspecified future date. In June 2014 Cubicle 7 released The Limited Edition Doctor Who Rulebook,http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/doctor-who-limited-edition-in-stores-now/ presenting Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space as a single volume hardcover book for the first time. This featured character sheets reflecting the Doctor Who Anniversary Special Episode ‚Äî \\"Day of the Doctor\\", and a number of specially commissioned spreads featuring The Doctors, their companions, adversaries and allies. In 2015, the Twelfth Doctor Edition of the game was released, with a name change to simply Doctor Who Roleplaying Game. It features a new layout style to match Peter Capaldi's first series. Game mechanics The mechanics of the game are difficulty based. Characters have attributes (such as Strength and Ingenuity) and skills (such as Fighting and Technology) which they typically add together and then further add the results of two six-sided dice. The result is compared to a difficulty number normally set by the gamesmaster. Both success and failure are graduated, so that matching, or else exceeding the difficulty by only a small amount, indicates a successful action, but not a complete success. Exceeding the difficulty by a larger amount indicates complete success and exceeding it by a very great amount indicates success with an additional beneficial outcome. For example, if attempting to disguise oneself to get past some guards, the lowest level of success would get the character past the guards, but they would be suspicious and perhaps mention it to their superior later. A simple success would simply get the character past the guards, but the highest level of success might, for example, indicate that the guard radios ahead to let other guards know that they're legitimate visitors. Conversely, failure is also graded. In the previous example, the least degree of failure might merely result in the guard telling the character to go back and get their identification. A full failure and the guard will certainly realise he is being tricked and the greatest degree of failure could result in the character accidentally revealing who they really are, for example. In addition to the normal mechanics of the game, players acquire Story Point tokens throughout the game, which they can spend to adjust both the results of their characters' actions and to influence the world around them. The greater the effect, the more Story Points need to be spent to achieve it. For example, to adjust their level of success or failure up or down a level, a player can spend one Story Point. Or a Story Point could be spent to achieve some small change to the game world, such as keys being left in a car or a Cyberman's gun jamming for a moment. Greater amounts can be spent for correspondingly greater effects; for example, if five points were spent, maybe the villain would fall in love with one of the characters or a group of UNIT soldiers show up to rescue the PCs. Story Points are awarded by the gamesmaster for cleverness, good role-playing, heroism and for deliberate failure. For example, if the players allowed their characters to be captured, the gamesmaster might award them each a few Story Points for making the game more interesting. These Story Points may well be used in escaping later. Thus Story Points preserve a kind of credit-balance allowing players to participate in guiding the overall arc of the story without undermining the gamesmaster. Note that NPCs and monsters also have Story Points in relation to their plot significance. The gamesmaster is at liberty to spend these points on the NPCs behalf and they act as a gauge to determine how much adjusting of the world should be permitted for the NPC. For example, a lowly alien guard will have very few Story Points. If the PCs had tied the guard up earlier, perhaps the guard has just enough that can be spent to escape and sound the alarm. Whereas a major villain such as Davros will have many Story Points ‚Äì enough to mysteriously escape a crashing spaceship by finding an escape pod. Nonviolence Although the game does not forbid PCs from violence, violent solutions to problems are discouraged in a number of ways by the game. The most obvious method by which this is achieved is the Initiative system in which characters proceed according to the type of action they wish to take. In the game, this is called: \\"Talkers, Runners, Doers, Fighters\\". So if a player wishes their character's action to be trying to persuade people not to shoot at her, then that action takes place first. If another character wishes to run away, then that action takes place next. If a third character wishes to shoot out the lights so that their attackers can't see them, then that action takes place next (even though the action is a shooting action, it's not a 'Fighting' action). Finally, any characters wishing to fight the enemies (as well as the enemies that are shooting), take their turns. This system not only gives precedence to non-violent actions, but mirrors very closely what occurs in the Doctor Who show itself, where the Doctor frequently talks his way past enemies or, almost as often, runs away from them. The second mechanical method by which violence is discouraged is simply the deadliness of combat in the game. Whilst Story Points act as a buffer helping prevent the actual deaths of a character, combat in the Doctor Who game tends to be swift and brutal, with many alien weapons simply doing \\"Lethal\\" damage, rather than a damage number. Characters that seek violent solutions to problems are at grave risk of injury, with damage being removed directly from character attributes. Finally, the premise of Doctor Who makes many problems simply unsolvable by personal scale violence. Foiling an invading army of Cybermen cannot be done by individual fighting. Similarly, many alien threats are simply overwhelmingly powerful for humans to deal with. For example, there is no weapon in the core rule books that can actually damage a Dalek by the stats that are given for it.

The center of the complex is the house where Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova, lived from April 1939 to August 1940, and where Trotsky was murdered. Trotsky's teenage grandson, Vsevolod Volkov (aka Seva Volkov, Esteban Volkov), also lived with Trotsky and Sedova at the house from August 1939 to August 1940. The house has been kept as it was at that time, especially the study in which Ram√≥n Mercader killed Trotsky with an ice axe to the back of the head. Around the house is a garden and high walls with watchtowers. The complex was turned into the current museum and asylum institution in 1990, on the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Trotsky‚Äôs exile and assassination at the house Study where Trotsky was murdered Trotsky was forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in February 1929 because of his criticism of Joseph Stalin's government. For the next eight years, Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, wandered among several countries under surveillance, and later under a death sentence due to Trotsky's persistent political activity against Stalin from exile. Trotsky was pursued by Stalinist agents, and other enemies like White √©migr√©s from the Russian Civil War, at his exile in Turkey from February 1929 to July 1933, in France from July 1933 to June 1935, and in Norway from June 1935 to December 1936. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were successful in persuading the L√°zaro C√°rdenas government to give the Trotskys political asylum in Mexico, and Trotsky and Sedova arrived in Mexico in January 1937. From January 1937 to April 1939, the couple lived at Frida Kahlo's family home called ‚ÄúLa Casa Azul‚Äù (The Blue House), which is located in the Coyoac√°n borough of Mexico City. However, by 1939, Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky had a falling-out. Some stories state that it was over ideology and Diego's criticism of Trotsky's writing and others state that Trotsky had had an affair with Frida, or a combination of both. The Trotskys then moved to the house on Viena Street in the same borough in April 1939, not far from The Blue House. While Mexico had an active Communist movement at that time, like elsewhere it was divided between those who supported Stalin and those who opposed him. On 24 May 1940, a failed attempt on Trotsky's life was led by NKVD agent Iosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. The group were disguised as police officers and managed to overpower guards, set up machine guns in the house's inner courtyard and began firing at the various rooms of the small house. Those inside survived by hiding under bedroom furniture. Trotsky's grandson, 14-year-old Seva, was wounded in the foot. Robert Sheldon Harte, a young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, was abducted and later murdered, but the other guards defeated the attackers.Trotsky's grandson recalls ice pick killing, BBC News, Mike Lanchin, 28 August 2012 This attack prompted the building of the walls that surround the property and the building of guard towers, which gives the property a fortress-like appearance. The next attempt on Trotsky's life, on 20 August 1940, was successful. A Spanish Stalin supporter by the name of Ram√≥n Mercader, under the name of Jacson Mornard and with a Canadian passport, had become the lover of Trotsky's personal secretary. As such, he gained the household's trust and was permitted on the premises. On that day, Mercader asked Trotsky to look over something he had written, and as Trotsky read the work, Mercader removed an alpine climbing axe from his coat and struck Trotsky in the back of the skull. The blow to Trotsky's head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly, as Mercader had intended. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader's hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's bodyguards burst into the room and nearly killed Mercader, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions.Volkogonov, Dmitri (1996). Trotsky: The Eternal Revolutionary. Free Press. ; p. 466 Trotsky was taken to a hospital, operated on, and survived for more than a day before he died on 21 August 1940, as a result of loss of blood and shock.Walsh, Lynn, The Assassination of Trotsky, Militant International Review, Summer 1980; retrieved 29 July 2007Enrique Soto-Perez-de-Celis MD, The Death of Leon Trotsky, Neurosurgery 67: 417‚Äì423, 2010 Mercader was arrested by Mexican police, convicted of murder and spent twenty years in a Mexican prison. When he was released in 1960, Mercader reportedly fled to Prague, then Moscow, where he received the Order of Lenin. According to some later reports, he would die of cancer in Havana. The room in which Trotsky was killed remains exactly as it was at that moment, including the papers and the books in their exact positions. The museum Trotsky's tomb in the house garden The museum consists of the house that Trotsky lived in, the garden area and the outer walls with guard facilities, located in a quiet, residential neighborhood next to an arroyo that ran parallel to the Churubusco River. La Jornada newspaper called the atmosphere of the place ‚Äúreal, tense, not with abundance and not always happy.‚Äù The complex was declared a historic monument in 1982. The house is small and common for a dwelling built in the early 20th century in the area. One notable exception is a tower topped by a bronze eagle of the type that Venustiano Carranza used during the Mexican Revolution. It is claimed that it was a gift from Carranza to the house's former owner, a Mister Turatti. Bullet holes from the Siqueiros attack are still on the outer walls. The interior of the house has been kept as it was when Trotsky lived there, and appears somewhat dark and gloomy due to the bars and steel shutters on the windows. The kitchen has its pots and pans, shoes are lined alongside beds, with floors and beds covered by tattered Mexican textiles. There are some bullet holes in the interior as well. The center of the house is Trotsky's study were everything from his glasses, to papers, to books and more are left exactly as they were when Trotsky was attacked. Along the high outer walls and watchtowers are guard houses and other facilities that have been turned into exhibit halls and other facilities associated with the museum. These rooms display photographs, newspapers more personal effects of Trotsky and more. As a museum, some other buildings were added along the walls which contain photos from Trotsky's lifetime, biographical notes in Spanish and memorabilia such as Trotsky trademark small round glasses. The guards‚Äô house contains a permanent photographic collection containing images of Trotsky's family, his participation in the Bolshevik Revolution and his family tree. In what were once guest quarters at the end of the garden, hang dozens of black-and-white photos of Trotsky and Natalia accompanied by celebrity friends, such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. There are also temporary exhibit halls, which has new showings by various artists each month. Artistic showings include an annual exhibit of works by graffiti artists (or ‚Äúgraffiteros). The annual event aims to recognize the talents of these ‚Äúgrafiteros‚Äù which the museum considers to be victims of marginalization. However, the event has been attended by officials from the city's Public Security agency, the borough of Coyoac√°n, technical schools and even the Cuban embassy. In 2009, the graffiti exhibition was sponsored by the city's Secretary of Public Safety and a snack food company with twenty works considered to be the most representative of a contest called ‚ÄúLas cosas chidas, r√≥lalas‚Äù (Cool things, roll (share) them). The auditorium seats eighty and the Rafael Galv√°n library has a collection of over 6,000 volumes mostly on the social sciences, economics and politics. The rest of the complex space is taken up by the garden area, which is still maintained with tropical flowers and other plants, such as rare cacti, which Trotsky collected. There are photos in the museum of Trotsky collecting cacti in the Mexican countryside and tending the garden along with the rabbits and chickens which were in the hutches and coops that still exist. The center of the garden contain a stone stele designed by Juan O‚ÄôGorman, which contains Trotsky's ashes along with those of his wife. Above the stele is a flagpole with the Soviet flag. The current museum was created on 20 August 1990, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination along with the Instituto del Derecho de Asilo y las Libertades P√∫blicas (Institute for the Right of Asylum and Public Liberties). The latter was created to help other political dissident seeking asylum in Mexico, but it was consolidated with the museum in 1996. The official name of the organization is now the Instituto del Derecho de Asilo Museo Casa de Le√≥n Trotsky. The museum receives an average of 17,000 foreign visitors each year, along with 50,000 students from visits organized by the Secretariat of Public Education. This generates about 20,000 pesos in income each week. The museum is supported only by income and donations. There is occasional support by the city government such as the renovation of the guard tower. Between January and March 2010, the museum received 11,000 visitors, mostly students and foreigners, despite the lack of a coordinated promotional effort.

Life Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin was the daughter of actor William Talbot Richards (d. 1813), who at the time of her birth in Dublin had been engaged with her mother at the Crow Street Theatre. Her mother's name and fate is unknown; when Edwin was around eight her father married twenty-one-year-old Sarah Edmonds in London.Annual register, Part 1, 1822, p.584 accessed 13 October 2012Sarah Edmonds and William Talbot Richards, 22 May 1778, London and Surrey, England, Marriage Bonds and Allegations, 1597-1921, Ancestry.com At Crow Street Theatre, when eight years old, she appeared in Prince Arthur and other juvenile characters, including a part written specially for her by O'Keefe in his lost and forgotten farce, The Female Club. She also, for her benefit, played Priscilla Tomboy in The Romp, an abridged version of Bickerstaffe's Love in the City. She left the stage for a time to be educated. After playing in the country she appeared at Covent Garden Theatre 13 November 1789, as Miss Richards from Margate, in The Citizen of Murphy.Adams, William Davenport - A Dictionary of the Drama, 1904, p. 447 accessed 14 October 2012 Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin NYPL Digital Gallery The following year she joined at Hull the company of Tate Wilkinson, playing with great success in comedy. In the line of parts taken by Mrs. Jordan, Wilkinson declares her the 'very best' he has seen, surpassing her predecessor in youth and grace. 'Her face,' he says, 'is more than pretty, it is handsome and strong featured, not unlike Bellamy's; her person is rather short, but take her altogether she is a nice little woman'. She married John Edwin the younger and she joined with her husband the mixed company of actors and amateurs assembled by the Earl of Barrymore at Wargrave.Robinson, John Robert, The Last Earls of Barrymore, 1894, pp.111‚Äì113 accessed 13 October 2012 She appeared with her husband at the Haymarket Theatre, 20 June 1792, as Lucy in An Old Man taught Wisdom. Subsequently, she passed to the private theatre in Fishamble Street, Dublin, opened by Lord Westmeath and Frederick Jones. In October 1794 she had rejoined Tate Wilkinson, appearing in Doncaster with her husband. With him she visited Cheltenham, and 14 October 1797, still in his company, made, as Mrs. Edwin from Dublin, her first appearance in Bath, playing Amanthis and Roxalana. Here, in Bristol, or in Southampton, where she became a special favourite, she took the leading characters in comedy and farce. In 1805, while in Dublin, she lost her husband to suicide. She ascribed his death to his sensibility on the memorial stone she commissioned. Her husband had been a talented comic actor but his reputation was lost in his wife's fame and he had drunk himself to death following a cruel poem that cast his as the 'lubbard spouse' of Mrs Edwin. Edwin was engaged for Drury Lane, but before she reached the theatre, it burnt down, and on 14 October 1809, she appeared as Widow Cheerly in The Soldier's Daughter, with the Drury Lane company at the Lyceum. The chief characters in comedy were assigned to her, and 3 February 1810 she was the original Lady Traffic in Riches, or the Wife and Brother, extracted by Sir James Bland Burgess from Massinger's City Madam. At Drury Lane she remained for some years. She was selected to recite, 3 July 1815, the verses of the manager Arnold in commemoration of Waterloo. She then returned to Dublin, to the Crow Street Theatre, and, engaged by Robert William Elliston, appeared, 16 November 1818, at the Olympic Theatre, speaking an opening address by Moncrieff. The following year she accompanied her manager to Drury Lane. Mrs. Edwin was also seen at the Haymarket, Adelphi, Surrey, and other West End theatres, and played at Scarborough, Weymouth and Cheltenham. At a comparatively early age she had earned enough to retired from the stage. She lost part of her savings to a dishonest stockbroker who absconded to America with between eight and nine thousand pounds of her savings. This compelled her to return again to acting. On 13 March 1821 she played at Drury Lane the Duenna in Sheridan's comic opera, as \\"her first appearance in a character of that description\\". With rare candour she owned herself too old for the part in which she was accustomed to appear. She appeared at Drury Lane the following season. For very many years she lived in retirement, and, all but forgotten, died at her lodgings in Chelsea 3 August 1854. She had the reputation of delivering an address or epilogue with especial grace and fervour. She was below the middle height, fair, and with expressive features. Careful in money matters, she barely escaped the charge of parsimoniousness. Portraits of her by Samuel De Wilde as Eliza in Riches and Albina Mandeville in The Will are in the Mathews collection at the Garrick Club.

It was founded by Lou Engle in 2004 and now has locations in five U.S. cities. They are in close association with the International House of Prayer-Kansas City and The Call. Practices Initially founded in Washington D.C. to focus on prayer for the 2004 United States presidential election, Engle credits a series of dreams and visions with inspiring him to start a house of prayer in Washington D.C. They choose to operate in locations that are considered religiously or politically liberal, rather than in more conservative parts of the country. JHOP organizers attempt to locate their buildings near areas that they deem to be spiritually significant, such as the United States Supreme Court or Harvard University. Each location is staffed by a number of interns, also sometimes referred to as \\"prayer activists,\\" who devote their time to bible study, prayer, and public demonstrations against abortion. They often stand outside of courthouses with their mouths taped shut with red tape that has the word \\"Life\\" written on it. Their silent protests are designed to represent the silence of the unborn and what they perceive to be the silence of the American church regarding the issue of abortion. JHOP members also lead prayer meetings in front of abortion clinics, and the San Diego branch attempted to pray in front of every abortion clinic in California in 2008. Some locations also practice Street Preaching. Each location hosts regular prayer gatherings featuring harp and bowl worship, as well. They occasionally host teams of staff members from IHOP-Kansas City for prayer or evangelism initiatives. They have also raised money for children in need. Beliefs JHOP focuses on prayer for issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and humanism. JHOP members often attempt to spend long hours in focused prayer for these causes, sometimes praying all night. Members also regularly practice fasting, occasionally for 40 consecutive days. Neocharismatic in theology, JHOP members often interpret dreams, speak in tongues, and claim to have occasional visions. Controversy In 2006, a writer for the Boston LGBT newspaper Bay Windows accused JHOP of bigotry against the gay community, citing their practice of praying that same-sex marriage would not be legalized. In 2008, a group of Christians regularly met for prayer meetings on a street in the Castro District, a largely gay neighborhood of San Francisco. In November 2008, shortly after California Proposition 8 was passed, they were so endangered, the group had to be escorted out of the Castro District under the protection of the San Francisco Police Department riot police after being surrounded by a threatening crowd drawn from nearby bars. Initial media reports did not identify the affiliation of the group, although the Justice House of Prayer later claimed that members of their San Francisco location were the group in question.

Formed in 1997, the band released two albums featuring humorous songs, before disbanding in 2001.  History  The band, mainly consisting of actors, was formed in 1997 by Dragan Jovanoviƒá (vocals), Dejan Matiƒá (triangle, vocals), Nikola √êuriƒçko (guitar, vocals), Rade Markoviƒá (guitar, vocals), Boris Milivojeviƒá (bass guitar), Bogdan Dikliƒá (drums), Papa Nick (percussion) and Tibor Tot (percussion), intending to perform and record music for theatre plays. The band got the name by the theatre troupe called Kuguari which the band members were a part of, named after the state of the dressing room the actors used during the rehearsals which reminded them of a den occupied by the cougars. The debut album, released without much commercial ambition, consisted of the material recorded as a soundtrack for the Sme≈°na strana muzike (A Funny Side of Music) theatre play. Most of the tracks on the album were witty cover versions of either rock hits, including the Deep Purple song \\"Smoke on the Water\\", featuring the lyrics from the children poem \\"Leptiriƒáu ≈°areniƒáu\\" written by Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, \\"Raw Hide\\", renamed to \\"Gipsy Hide\\", or their interpretations of children songs, including \\"Ocka\\" and \\"Kad si sreƒáan\\". The album also featured the hit songs \\"Zidareva ljubav\\", a turbo folk parody song, for which the song lyrics were written by the director Srƒëan Dragojeviƒá, and the soccer anthem \\"Dejo\\" (a cover of Harry Belafonte song \\"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\\"), dedicated to the member of the Yugoslav national soccer team Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá. The second studio album, Open de dor (transliteration for Open the Door) presented the band in a more serious manner, but nonetheless featured a pornographic parody of the ABBA track \\"Chiquitita\\", a cover of the Miroslav Iliƒá hit \\"Ja zavoleh devojku iz grada\\", with lyrics in English language entitled \\"I Was Born\\", and a cover of \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\" from the Cabaret movie soundtrack, with lyrics in Serbian language entitled \\"Buduƒánost je samo za nas\\". The album also featured a cover of the blues standard \\"Fever\\" with lyrics in Serbian language renamed to \\"Zima\\", which became a nationwide hit, and the a cappella version of the Bijelo Dugme song \\"Ne spavaj mala moja muzika dok svira\\", for which the lead vocals were provided by Bogdan Dikliƒá, recorded in order to resemble the version Dikliƒá had sung in the 1979 film Nacionalna klasa. On November30, 1999, the percussionist Tibor Tot died in a car accident and the band ceased to exist.

John C. Tibbetts, and James M. Welsh, eds. The Encyclopedia of Novels Into Film (2nd ed. 2005) pp 77‚Äì78. Plot The wealthy Hulot family gathers at the deathbed of their matron Adeline (Geraldine Chaplin). Adeline's husband, the Baron Hector Hulot (Hugh Laurie) has squandered their fortune on an extravagant string of mistresses and plunged them heavily into debt, a fact which stresses the entire family. Adeline's Cousin Bette (Jessica Lange), a poor and aging spinster, has spent her life supporting Adeline and her family with little return, and promises the dying Adeline that she will watch over the family, especially Adeline's young, unmarried daughter, Hortense (Kelly Macdonald). Because they were poor as children, their family chose to sacrifice Bette and launch only Adeline into an advantageous marriage due to her greater beauty, a fact which has caused Bette much hardship and regret in life. Believing the death of Adeline to result in reward at last, Bette is stricken and infuriated when what she believes to be a proposal of marriage and an offer of a true place in the family from Baron Hulot is, in fact, an offer of employment to work as their (unpaid) housekeeper. Bette returns to her humble apartment and continues her meager living as the costume maker for a Burlesque theater, where she becomes friends with the headliner of the show: the famed courtesan (and Baron Hulot's mistress) Jenny Cadine (Elisabeth Shue), and saves the life of a young and handsome sculptor living in her building‚Äîthe displaced and impoverished Count Wenceslas Steinbach (Aden Young). Bette dotes on Wenceslas, giving him money, attention, and guidance. Under Bette's controlling eye, the lackadaisical young artist grows more successful and productive. Finding joy in her new companion, Bette tells her niece, Hortense, of her \\"sweetheart\\" Wenceslas and of her happiness. Hortense, parched from a steady stream of ugly, dull, but wealthy, suitors, is intrigued by her aunt's romantic stories of the handsome artist who happens to be a lord and decides to hunt him down in secret and steal him away from her aunt for an affair. Preferring youth and beauty, the pair marry and Wenceslas accepts a prestigious art commission that would guarantee his major debut‚Äîif successful. Bette views the theft of Wenceslas, whom she loved, as the final betrayal and vows revenge. Enlisting the aid of Jenny, Bette begins to manipulate the Hulot family into succumbing to their baser desires and court their own demises. One after the other, they fall into ruin under Bette's subtle guidance. Baron Hulot suffers a debilitating stroke, Hortense finds herself in prison, Bette's nephew, Victoren, flees for his life from loan sharks, Wenceslas is left a dead mockery of an artist, and the family name is in shamed and impoverished tatters. Bette ends the film successful and triumphant. Bette has amassed a small fortune and is now in control of the Hulot family's infant heir, whom she will raise as her own to be a great artist who returns her love.

Earl Pardoe 1922 Thomas Earl Pardoe (1885‚Äì1971) was the first head of the Brigham Young University (BYU) drama program. One of the main theaters in the Harris Fine Arts Center at BYU is named for him and his wife, Kathryn Bassett Pardoe, who was also an influential drama teacher at BYU. Pardoe was born and raised in Ogden, Utah. Pardoe was involved in high school and community dramatic productions, but when he went to Stanford University, it was to study engineering. In his studies, he discovered that he was more suited to a career in theatre. He returned to Ogden and worked as a stagehand and back-up actor for the Ogden Opera Company before going to study at the Leland Powers School in Boston. While there he also served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in part because his uncle, Ben E. Rich, was the mission president. While in Boston, Pardoe also performed with the Boston Grand Opera and was a correspondent for the Deseret News. Pardoe graduated from Leland Powers in 1913. Pardoe then returned to Ogden where he met Kathryn Bassett when he played the lead male role to her female lead in a comedic opera. They were married on June 3, 1914, with the ceremony performed by David O. McKay. Pardoe then became a drama and speech teacher at Weber Academy, the predecessor of Weber State University. In 1916, Pardoe taught at BYU's summer session. In 1919, he came to BYU working as a tennis coach and also to teach drama and public speaking. He also earned a bachelor's degree from BYU in 1925. In 1927, Pardoe left BYU to teach at the Major School of Theatre in Los Angeles. Pardoe later earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of Southern California. During this time, he also served as director of the Long Beach Little Theatre. Pardoe then earned a Ph.D. in speech from Louisiana State University. He returned to BYU where he served as head of the speech department. From 1952 until his death in 1971, Pardoe primarily worked with the BYU Alumni Association, serving as BYU Historian. Up until this point Pardoe had been the only head of BYU's drama department. He seems to have taught drama classes even after his appointment as historian, which in theory had meant he had retired. Pardoe was president of the Utah Speech Association, the Rocky Mountain Forensic League, and the Western Speech Association at various times during his career. Pardoe wrote multiple speech and drama textbooks, as well as The Sons of Brigham, which is a history of the early presidents, professors, and graduates of BYU.Goodreads article on The Sons of Brigham Pardoe also later served as a member of the general board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of the LDS Church. In 1954 and 1955, Pardoe served a second LDS mission in New England. Notes References *Kathryn B. Pardoe, Family History of T. Earl and Kathryn B. Pardoe, located in the L.

The attacks, part of Queen Anne's War (the North American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession), resulted in the burning of the town, and caused most of its Indian population to flee, although the fort withstood repeated attacks. The battles were primarily fought in the nighttime hours due to the excessive heat of the day. The first siege, in August, resulted in the destruction of the town, but Fort San Carlos de Austria successfully resisted the onslaught. In late November, a second expedition arrived, and made unsuccessful attacks on three consecutive nights before withdrawing. Pensacola's governor, Don Sebasti√°n de Moscoso, whose garrison was depleted by disease, recruited convicted criminals to assist in the fort's defense.  Background  English and Spanish colonization efforts in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century.Arnade (1962), p. 31 The Spanish population of Florida at the time was fairly small. Since its founding in the 16th century, the Spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify the local Indian population and convert them to Roman Catholicism.Boyd et al, p. 10 The founding in 1670 by the English of Charles Town (present-day Charleston, South Carolina) in the recently established (1663) Province of Carolina heightened tensions. By the early 18th century, Carolina traders like Anthony Dodsworth and Thomas Nairne had established alliances with Creek Indians in the upper watersheds of rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico, who they supplied with arms and from whom they purchased slaves and animal pelts. These traders penetrated into Spanish Florida, leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides.Crane (1919), p. 381 In 1700, Carolina's governor, Joseph Blake, threatened the Spanish that English claims to Pensacola, established by the Spanish in 1698, would be enforced.Crane (1919), p. 384 Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, the French founder of Mobile, in January 1702, warned the Spanish commander at Pensacola that he should properly arm the Apalachee Indians and engage in a vigorous defense against English incursions into Spanish territory. D'Iberville even offered equipment and supplies for that purpose.Crane (1956), p. 73 However, an attempt at a punitive expedition against the Creek resulted in a rout of the Spanish and their Apalachee allies in October, shortly before news of war declarations bringing England into the War of the Spanish Succession arrived.Boyd (1953), pp. 469‚Äì471 After a failed English assault on St. Augustine, Spanish mission towns were severely reduced by numerous raids by Carolina-led Indians against the Spanish mission network from 1703 to 1706.Crane (1956), pp. 78‚Äì81 A French-organized 1706 expedition against Charles Town was a failure but motivated Carolina authorities to again target the Spanish at Pensacola and the French at Mobile.Crane (1956), p. 88 Nairne proposed a major expedition after the attack on Charles Town, intending to recruit as many as 1,500 Indians to capture Mobile, but political divisions in Carolina prevented execution of the plan.Crane (1956), p. 90  First siege  In 1707, Pensacola was under the command of Don Sebasti√°n de Moscoso. The exact size of his garrison in 1707 is not known. The authorized strength of the garrison was 220, but it rarely reached that strength owing to the difficulty in recruiting soldiers, for what was viewed as a highly undesirable posting, and a fairly high rate of desertion. Moscoso reported in 1708 that the garrison numbered about 100, having been reduced by the events of 1707.Griffen, p. 247 The garrison was housed in Fort San Carlos de Austria, a wooden stockade fort built in 1698.Bense, p. 48 Spanish map of the Florida Gulf coast, 1700 Extant records do not describe the composition of the forces that attacked Pensacola in August beyond \\"several hundred Tallapoosas and a few South Carolina traders\\".Oatis, p. 70 The siege began on 12 August with the arrival of a band of 20 to 30 Indians, who began terrorizing the Indians living in the town outside the fort. They took prisoners (including some women and children) and began burning houses. Governor Moscoso fired one of the fort's cannons, scattering the attackers; some of their captives managed to escape to the fort in the confusion. Two days later, ten men sent out of the fort to do laundry disappeared. On 14 August an estimated 300 Indians appeared before the fort and engaged it in a battle lasting several hours.Griffen, p. 251 The next day the attack resumed, as did the pillaging of the town. Activity quieted down until 18 August, when an English flag was raised over a house near the fort. This prompted Moscoso to open fire from the fort, beginning a battle that raged until dark. That day, the attackers burned down the rest of the town, and Moscoso's men had to work to prevent the fort from burning as well.Higginbotham, pp. 309‚Äì310 While the Spanish inspected the rubble, one of them was taken prisoner on 19 August and a second person was captured the next day. This marked the end of active assaults on the fort. However, the area beyond the range of the fort's guns was unsafe for at least the next month; a number of people also disappeared after they ventured too far from its vicinity.Griffen, p. 252  Second siege  The second siege began with the arrival on 27 November of a contingent of about 20 Carolina traders and 300 Creeks, primarily Tallapoosas and Alabamas.Hall, p. 108 On that day, an Englishman (unidentified in Spanish reports, but possibly Thomas Nairne) brought a demand for surrender written in English. Since none of the Spaniards could read it, he was sent away, and the demand was eventually transmitted orally by a French Huguenot.Higginbotham, p. 311Ethridge, p. 221 Moscoso rejected the demand, even though his garrison was depleted by disease. The besiegers began an ineffectual attack on the fort around midnight which lasted until daybreak, at which point they delivered a final surrender demand which Moscoso again refused. In order to supplement his forces, he successfully recruited convicts being held in the fort's guardhouse to participate in the defense, offering them freedom and money for their service. During each of the next two nights the besiegers renewed their attacks on the fort, without significant effect. During the night of 29/30 November, one of the leading Creek chiefs was killed. This apparently broke the besiegers' morale, for the siege was lifted the following morning.Higginbotham, p. 312 The attackers were reported to have suffered significant casualties. Word of the attacking force had reached the French at Mobile on 24 November. Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville raised a force of 100 Frenchmen and 400 Indians. They reached Pensacola on 8 December, only to learn that the siege had been lifted a week earlier.French, p. 98  Aftermath  Aerial view of Fort Barrancas These attacks were the last major assaults on Pensacola in the war, although there continued to be minor skirmishes and kidnappings.Griffen, p. 253 Most of the Indians that fled during the sieges never returned, reducing Pensacola to little more than its garrison. Governor Bienville learned from a Spaniard who had escaped English hands that Mobile was also being targeted for attack.Higginbotham, p. 313 He improved Mobile's defenses in 1708, but the outpost was never attacked; a village of Mobile Indians was attacked in May 1709, however.Higginbotham, pp. 360‚Äì364, 383 A French force from Mobile captured Pensacola from the Spanish in 1719, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, but it was returned to Spain after the war.Marley, pp. 368‚Äì371 The location of Fort San Carlos de Austria is now occupied by Fort Barrancas, a National Historic Landmark whose construction began late in the 18th century.

Description The Moss Landing Wildlife Area protects of Monterey County, California, just north of the town of Moss Landing, California. It includes part of the largest unaltered salt marsh on the California coast. Access is allowed only by foot on trails, and all plants and animals are protected. It is a popular spot for birding and viewing sea otters. Some limited hunting is allowed during certain limited seasons, but rifles or pistols are not allowed. It is administered through the California Department of Fish and Game. A small strip of the reserve (the easiest to access) lies just east of Highway 1 (called the Cabrillo Highway) at opposite the Moss Landing Yacht Harbor. Other sections lie north of Elkhorn Slough, and west of the slough after it turns to the north, at . To access the north shore section, a trailhead is off Highway 1 between the two intersections of Struve Road, at . A level Marsh Trail runs from this area to a small picnic area, and then the main channel of Elkhorn Slough. The eastern shore of Elkhorn Slough is protected as part of the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. Moss Landing State Beach and Zmudowski State Beach provide access to the Monterey Bay directly west of the wildlife area. History Western snowy plovers can be seen from the reserve. In the late 1800s about 200 acres of what is now the wildlife area were salt evaporation ponds used to commercially produce sea salt for use in local fish canneries. Owned by the Moss Landing Salt WorksMonterey County Free Libraries, the ponds were abandoned in 1974. The wildlife area was established by the state of California in 1984, and was managed in cooperation with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary when it was established in 1992. The former salt ponds provide habitat for several shorebird species. The number of western snowy plovers (Charadrius nivosus) nesting in the ponds in spring improved after active management began in 1995 by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory Conservation Science group. publication Number 1251 In 1999 the ponds were identified as the most critical breeding habitat in the Monterey Bay region for the plovers. In 2006 a managed tidal flow was improved, funded by Ducks Unlimited, the California Wildlife Conservation Board and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. In late fall water levels are raised to encourage roosting brown pelicans. In early spring (March or April) the ponds are drained and before the mud dries, volunteers are organized into a \\"mudstomp\\" to create shallow impressions as nesting sites. Binoculars, telescopes, or cameras with telephoto lenses are best used for viewing since observers are restricted from getting too close. Herons, sandpipers, egrets and other waterbirds also are seen in season. The northern entrance and trails can often be closed to public access.

Early life After having attended a sports training event on July 17, 1932, the day of the street riots which were later named Altona Bloody Sunday (German: \\"Altonaer Blutsonntag\\"), twelve-year-old Ferdinand Raeschke returned home to his family's apartment at Kleine Marienstrasse and found his mother, Anna Raeschke, dead on the kitchen floor. Anna Raeschke had been incidentally killed near the kitchen window by a stray bullet to her head, when over 7000 paramilitary troops of SA and SS, as well as a rapidly growing number of residential members of the communist party KPD were roaming the streets, until they were met by an insufficient number of police men who, at some point, had started to shoot in panic. From then on, Ferdinand Raeschke had to grow up with literally no support and eventually started out as an amateur boxer. After Second World War he continued as a professional boxer.

The Sazerac Company Web Site. (Access date December 6, 2010.) The company is owned by billionaire William Goldring and his family. As of 2017, it operated nine distilleries, had 2,000 employees, and operated in 112 countries. It is one of the two largest spirits companies in the U.S., with annual revenue of about $1 billion made from selling about 300 mostly discount brands. History The company was founded after the purchase of a bar known as the Sazerac Coffee House in 1869 by Thomas H. Handy. The coffee house itself had been established in 1850. After its purchase, Handy's company began to acquire and market brands of liquor. According to the company, the Sazerac Coffee House had been named after a cocktail called the Sazerac that was created in the mid-1800s by the Creole immigrant Antoine Am√©d√©e Peychaud, who operated a pharmacy on Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1838. The company publishes a Sazerac recipe and produces a Peychaud's Bitters named after Peychaud, which is an ingredient in the traditional Sazerac cocktail.New Orleans Declares Sazerac Its Cocktail of Choice, National Public Radio All Things Considered, June 26, 2008. (Access date December 6, 2010.) William Goldring began buying shares of the company in 1984, and eventually purchased the entire company. In 2009, the company's principal office was moved to Louisville, Kentucky, reflecting an increased company focus on bourbon whiskey production. However, the Sazerac Company still maintains an active presence in the New Orleans area, and it also has operations in Carson and Loomis, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Bardstown, Frankfort, and Owensboro, Kentucky; Fredericksburg, Virginia; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Lewiston, Maine; Londonderry, New Hampshire; Newport, Tennessee; and Sergonzac, France. In 2016, the company had an estimated revenue of $1 billion per year and a market valuation estimate of $4.5 billion. The valuation placed Goldring in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated net worth of $3.9 billion. Distilleries * A.

Georges has participated as the main actor in more than 25 television shows out of which he was the script writer and director of three sitcoms which were ranked as the most viewed. He has produced, directed and starred in 13 plays, each of which was attended by an audience of more than 100,000 spectators. He was the main actor in Under the Bombs and Silina and he was the writer and lead actor of a new Lebanese movie Ghadi released in 2013 and the writer and supervisor of the Lebanese movie Waynon released in 2014. Early life Khabbaz was born into a family of artists.... His father Georges Joubran Khabbaz has played in many plays such as Sahriyyi for Ziad Rahbani and he attended several roles in television programs such as Les Miserables, Youth 73, and in some episodes with the Abu Melhem. His mother Odette Atiyyeh was also represented in many plays, especially in the local festivals. Georges Khabbaz studied at Holy Spirit University of Kaslik and obtained a degree in musical comedy. He was four years old when he stood for the first time on stage, in the school during the play Life of St. Maron, but professionally he began his theatre career in 1994. Career Films In 2006, Georges Khabbaz starred with Nada Abou Farhat in the film Under the Bombs (or Sous Les Bombes) directed by Philippe Aractingi. The film, which used \\"real shots of the war and of the horrors it created among the civilian population\\", follows a Muslim woman as she tries to find her son in the immediate aftermath of the Lebanese war, accompanied by a Christian taxi driver Georges Khabbaz. London Evening Standard reviewer Derek Malcolm praised (Georges Khabbaz)'s performance as \\"excellent\\". However Time Out London reviewer Dave Calhoun described the film as \\"deeply flawed\\". The film was one of 16 out of 983 submissions to be selected for screening at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition. Khabbaz was awarded Best Actor in a Feature at the 8th Annual Rotterdam Film Festival for the role. Alain Spira wrote in Paris Match on May 5, 2008 that Georges Khabbaz the star in his country is \\"literally Al Pacinesque.\\" The 2008 film Silina, directed by Hatem Ali, saw Khabbaz together with Duraid Lahham and Miriam Fares in a film retelling of the operetta Hala and the King (originally by Mansour and Assi Rahbani). Khabbaz plays the King of Silina, who is tricked by his entourage and as a result proposes marriage to a poor woman, believing her to be a princess he is destined to marry. In 2012 Khabbaz wrote and starred in the film Ghadi directed by Amin Dora and produced by The Talkies. In a small coastal town, Leba Georges Khabbaz a music instructor, marries his childhood sweetheart Lara. Medical tests show that his newborn has special needs. The towns-people are fast to reject little Ghadi. Leba and his friends must find a way to convince his neighbors to accept his young son. Their solution is genius, heartwarming and redemptive. The Hollywood Reporter said \\"The polished production and adamant view of a better human nature make GHADI hard to resist\\" Dora and Khabbaz have delivered a sly and absorbing comedy whose particular resonance for Arab viewers never undercuts its essential appeal to a potentially broad array of audiences. GHADI was selected to represent Lebanon in the foreign-language Oscar race 2015 (it was initially chosen last year but opened too late at home to qualify). Ghadi won the AUDIENCE AWARD at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg 2014, the KNN AUDIENCE AWARD at the International Busan Film Festival 2014, the AUDIENCE AWARD at the Arabian Sights Film Festival Washington 2014, the BEST FICTION and BEST ACTOR at La Nuit Des Mabrouk 2014 and the BEST LEBANESE MOVIE and BEST CINEMA ACTOR at Murex d'or2013. In 2013 Khabbaz wrote the film Waynon (Void) produced by the NDU Universityand he was the supervisor on seven directors from the college. A film that carries you away, while anchoring yourself in the reality of the country, the tragedy of the missing people from the Lebanese war. Waynon? where are they? the 17,000 missing persons in the Lebanese war. this is the question posed by the film, asked by mothers, sisters and daughters of the disappeared, a question that has an essentially feminine face. Waynon has participated in many festivals worldwide and received numeros international awards such as SPECIAL JURY AWARD at the Alexandria International Film Festival Egypt 2014, BEST FEATURE at Silk Road Film Festival 2014, OFFICIAL SELECTION at Dubai International Film Festival 2013 and BEST SCREENPLAY at Malm√∂ Arab Film Festival 2014.

He came into prominence during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 as a student leader from Peking University, which placed him onto the Chinese government's 21 Most Wanted list. He spent 10 months hiding in various locations in China, until he was smuggled out to Hong Kong on a shipping vessel. Feng and Chai Ling, a fellow student leader and his wife at the time, were given special permission by the French government to smuggle into France and flown out in secrecy to Paris accompanied by a French diplomat. He spent 15 years in France, in 2003 he received his Ph.D. degree of Religious Sciences on Taoism and Traditional Chinese Medicine at Sorbonne, Paris. He now resides in San Francisco, and continues to advocate for freedom and democracy in China. Feng strives to provide an uncensored representation of the events of the Tiananmen Square protests through his participation in social media and his website, 64memo.com. Feng is the author of A Tiananmen Journal: Republic on the Square, published in 2009 in Chinese. He is the Executive Director of Tiananmen Academy since 2014.  Life before and during the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protest  Feng was a Peking University graduate student during the 1986-87 pro-democracy student movement in Tiananmen Square, and was briefly arrested for his participation in the event. Right after his release, he discussed his experiences of the protest and the government response with the crowd of students that gathered. This was where he met Chai Ling, and the two developed a relationship that culminated into a marriage in the spring of 1988. He was admitted to Boston University for postgraduate study. On April 18, 1989, many Peking University students had gone to Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang. Hu Yaobang was a symbol of reform and justice, and was revered by many students and opponents of the regime. Policemen with nightsticks attacked the demonstrators in front of Xinhua Gate, and the confrontation lead to the early formations of organizations that would lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Feng had made his way to the forefront of the movement and became a founding member of the Preparatory Committee, which was designated to establish independent student leadership organizations. Throughout the course of the movement, Feng had been designated Chairman of the Coalition of Independent Student Unions of Beijing, the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Hunger Strike Group on Tiananmen Square, and then the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters. Despite being a charismatic student leader, Feng was often disillusioned by the protests and the political struggles of the student leaders, and was not involved in the student leadership at certain points of the movement.  Life after the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protest  Feng and Chai left Beijing soon after the crackdown. Their names listed as the 21 most wanted student leaders, the couple managed to arrive Hong Kong and eventually Paris in April 1990. Due to dissenting view on ways and means to handle the aftermath of the June 4 movement and promote democracy in China, Feng and Chai divorced in late 1990. Feng participated in House hearing on discussion of China's most favoured nation status. Feng finished the Memo of 1989 Student Protests (), the draft of A Tiananmen Journal: Republic on the Square in early 1991. Raising the idea of setting up a website to provide information related to the 1989 student movement in 2000, Feng established 64memo.com in the following year.  Response to the documentary The Gate of Heavenly Peace  Despite many positive reviews for The Gate of Heavenly Peace in the US media, Feng Congde, with the support of other Tiananmen survivors, participants and supporters, sent an ‚Äòopen letter‚Äô to the directors and producers of the documentary in 2009. He addressed several issues with the documentary, urging the producers to ‚Äúcorrect the false reporting and editing‚Äù in the film. Feng also criticized the producer, Carma Hinton for her affiliation with Chinese officials (notably Zhou Enlai and Zhang Chunqiao) and participation in the Cultural Revolution. *‚Äú‚Ä¶I want to live‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Chai Ling in the Philip Cunningham interview Feng argued that the producers of the documentary had used the language of Chai Ling to manipulate the truth and give a false impression that she ran away prior to the crackdown on June 4, 1989. As the documentary excluded the speech given by Chai Ling on June 8, he claimed that the film producers intentionally omitted it to reinforce the idea that Chai Ling had left the students while knowing that they would be massacred. The detailed account of the event in the June 8 speech would have been proof of her being in the Square until the violent crackdown by the government, and the omission of these accounts during the speech helped misrepresent historical truths. *‚Äúwomen qidai de jiu shi liuxue‚Äù (Êàë‰ª¨ÊúüÂæÖÁöÑÂ∞±ÊòØÊµÅË°Ä/ what we are actually hoping for is bloodshed) ‚Äì Chai Ling in the Philip Cunningham interview Feng claimed that Carma Hinton had mistranslated ‚Äúqidai‚Äù and taken it out of context to leave viewers with an impression that Chai Ling and other student leaders had provoked and hoped for the bloodshed that occurred during the crackdown. He suggested that ‚Äúqidai‚Äù properly translated as ‚Äúhope for with anticipation or wait.‚Äù Feng stated that the occupiers of the Square knew of the possible crackdown, and they wanted it to happen in public so the international community could see the oppressive nature of the Chinese government. He also noted that the producers should have made clear that the student leaders had made a major effort to make sure the students remaining in the Square prior to the crackdown were volunteers who understood the risks of staying. At the last moment on the Tiananmen Square, at about 4:30 am on June 4, 1989, it was Feng himself, after consulting Chai Ling and other student leaders still there, who gave the order to retreat from the Monument which situates at the center of the Square.

Hansen Harold I. Hansen (1914-1992) was a major theatre professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) and the director of the Hill Cumorah Pageant from 1937-1977, excluding the years during World War II in which it was not held. Hansen was born in Logan, Utah. Hansen did his undergraduate education at Utah State University. He then received an offer of a graduate assistantship at the University of Idaho to continue studies in drama, but at the urging of David O. McKay he accepted the call he had already received to serve in the Eastern States Mission. Hansen had very much hoped to serve in Denmark. It was while a missionary in the Eastern States mission that Hansen first served as director of the Hill Cumorah Pageant. Although pageants had been produced at the Hill Cumorah the previous two years, 1937 was the first year that H. Wayne Driggs' script, which would be the basis of the pageant until 1987, was used. Thus as the first director Hansen essentially had to figure out the ways to move from the script to actual production that would remain the main outline of the production for the next half-century, or ten years beyond his retirement as director. It was also there that he met Betty Kotter, also serving as a missionary in the mission, who he later married. They were actually married at the flagpole on the Hill Cumorah on July 16, 1940, just before a production of the Hill Cumorah Pageant, and about a year after Hansen had finished his mission. Harold would later claim this was where he and Betty first met, but she claimed the story he told of their first encounter was largely made up. They were sealed in the Logan Temple the following month. After his mission Hansen earned a masters in drama at Iowa State University. His thesis was on the history of drama as supported by religious institutions in the United States. From 1941-1942 Hansen was a seminary and institute instructor with the Church Educational System. He then performed at The Cleveland Play House until 1945 when he joined the faculty of Michigan State University. He then returned to Utah State University where he joined the Drama faculty and earned a Ph.D. in 1949 with the subject of his doctoral dissertation being a history of Mormon Theatre. In 1952 Hansen was recruited by Brigham Young University president Ernest L. Wilkinson to replace T. Earl Pardoe as head of the Drama department. From his start at BYU Hansen was producing cutting edge shows. During his first season he managed to perform both The Glass Managerie and Death of a Salesman. The reason this was exceptional is that at the time both shows were still running on broadway. In many ways the biggest BYU production done by Hansen was Sand in their Shoes, a musical about the Mormon Pioneers with text by Don Oscarson and music by Crawford Gates. While head of the BYU Theatre Department Hansen oversaw the implementation of graduate studies in 1960 and the move to suitable space in the Harris Fine Arts Center in 1965. Hansen remained the head of the BYU Theatre Department until 1979. While working at BYU Hansen was also involved as the co-owner and co-director with Lael Woodbury of the Ledges Theatre in Grand Ledge, Michigan from 1960-1967. They had previously from 1947-1952 run the Proscenium Players, also in Grand Ledge, from 1947-1952. From the end of World War II until 1977 Hansen had also served as director of the Hill Cumorah Pageant. In 1977 Hansen was replaced as director of the Hill Cumorah Pageant by Jack Paul Sederholm, who had studied at BYU and was then chair of the communications art department at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. Sederholm had served for 12 years previously as Hansen's chief assistant.Ensign Dec. 1977, article on transition of Hill Cumorah Pageant from Hansen to Sederholm In 1967 BYU Press published a book authored by Hansen with the same title as his doctoral dissertation.Mormon Literature Database entry for Hansen Hansen and his wife Betty were the parents of four daughters.

Design and development The Texas Aero Corporation of Temple, Texas was formed about 1927 to construct passenger and mail light aircraft. The companies origin can be traced back to George W Williams Texas Aero Manufacturing Company of 1911. It built a series of aircraft designs including the Texas-Temple Sportsman. The Sportsman was a parasol winged monoplane, equipped with two seats arranged in tandem. The cockpit had an open layout. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage was fitted. The tailplane was set low on the fin. A 100 h.p. Cirrus III was initially fitted. Operational history Three examples of the Sportsman were completed: NC480 manufacturers number 1; NC852H and N987N manufacturers number 107. There was no N987N registered in FAA records at the time, so it is likely to be from a later registration. There was an NC987H, but that was the registration for a different make of aircraft, a Smith S-1 with a Velie engine. The Sportsman was suitable for operation by individual sporting pilots. Williams was killed during 1930 in the crash while flying with a trainee pilot. The company folded after the accident. Surviving aircraft The Texas-Temple Sportsman on display at the Frontiers of Flight Museum The third Sportsman survived the Second World War and was rebuilt in 1990 by J.D.

The application was heard by Lord Justice Laws, who issued his decision on 29 April 2010 refusing the application. The case attracted significant media attention due to the issues involved, particularly the balance of religious and LGBT rights, the intervention of former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, Lord Carey of Clifton, who provided a witness statement in support of the application, and the judge's strongly worded rebuttal of the applicant's submissions. Background Gary McFarlane was a 48-year-old Christian from Bristol, employed as a relationship counsellor by the Avon branch of Relate, a charity providing relationship support including counselling for couples, families, young people and individuals, sex therapy, mediation and training courses. He joined the organisation in August 2003, and a condition of his employment was acceptance of the group's equal opportunities policy, which required him to ensure \\"that no person... [receive] less favourable treatment on the basis of characteristics, such as... sexual orientation...\\". Relate was also a member of the British Association for Sexual and Relationship Therapy, whose Code of Ethics required the therapist to \\"avoid discrimination... on grounds of... sexual orientation.\\" Although the applicant had found himself capable of assisting same-sex couples in counselling where discussion of sexual issues was not involved, in September 2006 he applied to undertake a diploma course in psycho-sexual therapy (PST) (a new name for sex therapy). Managers at Relate considered his raising of a possible conscionable objection to assisting same-sex couples with sexual issues to be incompatible with the organisation's equal opportunities policy and would reduce the number of couples he were able to help. On 12 December 2007, the applicant was asked to confirm in writing he would continue to counsel same-sex clients in both relationship counselling and PST with regard to all the sexual issues they may have brought, and that he would agree to carry out relationship work where it involved same-sex sexual issues. In January 2008, McFarlane responded that he was unable to confirm this, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated. During these he confirmed that he would provide the required services to same- sex couples and the proceedings were ended. In March of that year however, he indicated to his supervisor that he might find it difficult to carry out such work, and on 18 March 2008, the applicant was dismissed from his post on the grounds: :That on 7 January 2008 you stated to Relate that you would comply with its Equal Opportunities policy and Professional Ethics policy in relation to work with same-sex couples and same-sex sexual activities, when you had and have no intention of complying with Relate's policies on those issues. The applicant undertook an unsuccessful internal appeal against dismissal, and subsequently applied to the Employment Tribunal, claiming discrimination on the ground of religion or belief, harassment, unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal. The claim of wrongful dismissal was accepted on procedural grounds, but the other claims were dismissed, and the applicant appealed against the dismissal of the claims of discrimination and unfair dismissal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Employment Appeal Tribunal McFarlane's action before the Employment Appeal Tribunal was heard on 9‚Äì10 September 2009, and the judgement issued on 30 November. The Tribunal found that the applicant had suffered neither direct nor indirect discrimination under the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 or the Human Rights Act 1998. The Tribunal made particular reference to remarks by Lord Bingham in the House of Lords decision in R (Begum) v Denbigh High School, that \\"The Strasbourg institutions have not been at all ready to find an interference with the right to manifest religious belief in practice or observance where a person has voluntarily accepted an employment or role which does not accommodate that practice or observance and there are other means open to the person to observe his or her religion without undue hardship or inconvenience.\\" Reference was also made to Ladele v London Borough of Islington, a Christian registrar's unsuccessful appeal against dismissal for refusing to officiate civil partnership ceremonies. Court of Appeal McFarlane applied to the Court of Appeal to be allowed to appeal the decision of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, however his application was refused by Lord Justice Elias on 30 January 2010. A renewed application was made before Lord Justice Laws on 15 April 2010. It contained a request that his case be heard before a specially constituted court comprising the Lord Chief Justice and five Lords Justices with proven sensibility towards religious issues. A witness statement was also submitted in support of the application by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, Lord Carey of Clifton. The statement supported Mr McFarlane's request for a specially constituted court, and also sought to refute suggestions that Christian teaching on same-sex unions was discriminatory and that such views were equivalent to homophobia. The application was refused in a judgement delivered on 29 April 2010. Lord Justice Laws stated that \\"the conferment of any legal protection or preference upon a particular substantive moral position on the ground only that it is espoused by the adherents of a particular faith, however long its tradition, however rich its culture, is deeply unprincipled.\\" As religious beliefs were by their nature impossible to prove, they were necessarily subjective, and could therefore only be considered to bind the behaviour of the believer and not that of anyone else. He went on to state: :The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion ‚Äì any belief system ‚Äì cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would be on the way to a theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself. The application was refused. Consequent events Mr McFarlane appealed to the ECtHR on freedom of religion grounds.

In particular, telomere-binding protein refers to TTAGGG repeat binding factor-1 (TERF1) and TTAGGG repeat binding factor-2 (TERF2). Telomere sequences in humans are composed of TTAGGG sequences which provide protection and replication of chromosome ends to prevent degradation. Telomere-binding proteins can generate a T-loop to protect chromosome ends. TRFs are double-stranded proteins which are known to induce bending, looping, and pairing of DNA which aids in the formation of T-loops. They directly bind to TTAGGG repeat sequence in the DNA. There are also subtelomeric regions present for regulation. However, in humans, there are six subunits forming a complex known as shelterin.  Structure  There are six subunits forming the telomere-binding protein complex known as shelterin: TERF1, TERF2, POT1, TIN2, RAP1 and TPP1. Both TERF1 and TERF2 bind the telomeric repeat sequences in the duplex region of the genome in vivo. The DNA-binding proteins include TERF1, TERF2, and POT1, which have specific sequences, altering binding affinity or regulatory mechanisms. TIN2, RAP1, TPP1 are adaptor proteins influencing signalling complexes. Both TRFs are separate homodimer proteins, similar to the Myb helix-turn-helix motif with DNA binding folds at the C-terminus. There are highly conserved regions located in the centre with relation to the formation of homodimers. However, they differ in the N-terminus as TERF2 contains a basic motif while TERF1 is acidic so they do not dimerize. There is a 120Àö angular bend in TERF1 when binding to the telomeric site.  Function  The complex recognizes the TTAGGG telomeric sequences, indicating the end of a chromosome. Telomere- binding proteins function to generate a T-loop, which is a specialized loop structure to cap the telomeric ends. Telomerase activity is regulated by protection of telomeres 1 (POT1). They serve as a protective safeguard against premature degradation as the telomere ends are no longer hidden from damage detection. Telomere-binding proteins not present may cause the exposed telomeres to undergo a DNA repair response, having mistakenly identified the ends as a double-stranded break. This is due to the 3‚Äô overhang, which gradually shortens over time. A process known as uncapping occurs, in which the shelterin complex dissociates from the telomere when shrunk to a critical length.  TERF1  TERF1 is present during all stages of the cell cycle, acting as a negative regulator in tandem with TERF2 while in contrast to telomerase. Its main function seems to be observed in controlling the telomere lengths via inhibition of telomerase. Removal of TERF1 will therefore lead to an increase in telomere length. TERF1 may reduce the accessibility of telomerase towards the end of the DNA length, which results in its inhibition. There may be potential post-translation modifications of TERF1 by adding ribose to induce regulation of telomerase. After the lengthening of the telomere, TERF1 reassembles to form an inaccessible T-loop structure. It has homology to the Myb transcription factors as the protein-DNA complex requires both Myb repeats. TERF1 binds near the N-terminus on a highly conserved domain to form a homodimer interaction. Since TERF1 bends the telomeric site, it may be a critical step in properly functioning telomeres to maintain its length. TERF1 also serves to prevent problematic secondary structures from hindering progression by interacting with helicase for unobstructed unwinding.  TERF2  TERF2 is a homolog to TERF1, exhibiting many functional and biochemical similarities. TERF2, like TERF1 has some relation to the Myb DNA binding motif. It serves as a secondary negative regulator, as overexpression of TERF2 produces a shortened telomere. TERF2 may also conceal the ends of the telomere in order to prevent detection from degradation. There is more conservation across species in TERF2 possibly due to higher risk of senescence when mutated. TERF2 binds directly to the DNA sequence, forming a T-loop structure. Therefore, TERF2 plays a role in inducing loop formation by folding the 3‚Äô TTAGGG sequence back into the duplex sequence. When removed, degradation of telomeric 3‚Äô overhangs can be observed. However, this requires the work of excision repair exonuclease ERCC1/XPF so inhibition of TERF2 alone may not necessarily lead to immediate shortening. Upon deletion of TERF2, there is co- localization with TERF1 with the association of DNA damage response factors. Under regular cell conditions, TERF2 is known to suppress the ATM pathway, however, the mechanisms of which, are currently unclear.  Interactions   Shelterin complex subunits  TERF1 and TERF2 have particular roles known to be associated with other subunits within the shelterin complex. They interact with TIN2 to recruit TPP1 binding by allowing TIN2 to form a bridge. As a result, a cascade of interactions follows by recruiting POT1 and RAP1 and the shelterin complex is complete to protect and regulate the telomeric ends. TERF2 requires stabilization for proper functioning through the interaction of TERF1 and TIN2. This suggests that a deficiency in either of the three former proteins will lead to a dysfunctional cell. Despite being a negative regulator of telomerase, there are currently no known effects of TRFs on expression of telomerase.  Damage response factors  When TERF2 is absent or non- functioning, ATM kinase is activated at chromosome ends to trigger a DNA damage response, similar to a response to a double-stranded break. This will then recruit damage response factors such as H2AFX and 53BP1 when telomeres are shortened and deprotected. Upon activation of ATM kinase, p53 is triggered to induce cell cycle arrest and initiate apoptosis. As well, damage detection will mediate non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), producing an end-to-end fusion of double-stranded breaks. However, it is not yet known how telomeres can detect the presence of damage.  NER pathway  TERF2 also has implications in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway based on experiments on K5-Terf2 mice. It is suggested that individuals with critically short telomeres are more prone to skin cancer via UV-exposure. As a result, TERF2, with roles in telomere-length controls, may affect UV-damage repair. For example, XPF nuclease, a component of NER, localizes to telomeres when the damage repair response is triggered. The presence of TERF2 then initiates XPF activity leading to the excision of telomeric ends causing a reduction in length.  Clinical implications   Skin tumours  TERF2 may play a role in cancers as their expression has been shown to increase in human tumours. A study of tumours performed on mice induced overexpression of TERF2 in the skin. When exposed to light, notable observations showed hyperpigmentation and skin tumour similar to human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum. They found significantly shortened telomeres with increased instability of the overall chromosome when analyzing cells. Telomere shortening was attributed to XPF, an excision repair nuclease, with link to TERF2 causing genomic instability.  Oral cancer  Oral cancer also has a link to telomere-binding proteins, with TERF2 in particular. The overexpression of TERF2 has been a notable similarity across patients with oral malignancies in humans. Similar to UV-damaged cells, there was an overall genomic instability leading to uncapping of the telomeric ends. The imbalance of TERF2 and telomerase have significant implications in cancer-inducing mechanisms. By targeting the telomere-binding proteins which serve to protect the ends, it may prove fruitful in future drug therapy.

It's a city with a history despite its modernity. It was one of the most important trade ports on the Nile River. Trading ships traveling from Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt to Alexandria passed through its lock and up the Mahmoudiyah Canal. Also trading ships from Alexandria carried imported merchandises to Cairo passing by it.  Special location  The city's special location made it a major trade center in the region. As ships stopped in its natural mooring in the Nile the city had a major activity in markets.  History  Mahmoudiyah was built over Al-Atf () village, which was called Balhib (, ) in Middle Ages, and it was a police station belonging to the Rashid Center. It is distinguished by its great mosque that was built during the reign of Muhammad Ali. And it was named after Mahmoudiyah after the name of Sultan Mahmoud Khan in Istanbul. Egypt was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, at which time Muhammad Ali Pasha was one the governor in Egypt. Its name is associated with the name of a nearby canal, and the city is characterized by a hydraulic system of locks, whose waters patch the boats from the Nile and lower them from the canal to the level of the Nile. The city was surrounded by water, especially in the south. It was branching from the Mahmudiyah Canal, the Rashidiyya Canal, which used to supply Rashid and Idku with water for drinking and irrigation.  Modern  The city of Mahmoudiya was occupied by garrisons, like other strategic cities during the First World War. The British garrison consisted of Indian, Irish, African and English soldiers because the city was a strategic site and target for the Germans. Because the city is located at the mouth of the Mahmoudiyah Canal, which was a waterway to transport goods and the British weaponry from Alexandria to Cairo to enter boats to the Nile. In December 1916, the people were celebrating the wedding of a native couple, and they were marching in a procession, carrying lamps and torches, and they were shouting. The garrison's leader thought it was a rebellion so he ordered the garrison to attack the residents. Fighting between the locals and the garrison took place, which prompted the garrison commander to ask the town‚Äôs leaders to negotiate with them. The mayor of the city, Darwish al-Wailili, headed a delegation and met with the garrison commander and asked him to apologize to the people for this attack. In the 1919 revolution, the people of Mahmudiya smashed the Delta Railroad tracks and set the main station on fire. On July 11, 1942 and during World War II, Mahmoudiyah received thousands of displaced people who were spared the horrors of bombing and bombs from Alexandria, Kafr el-Dawar, Khorshid, and al-Baida. It was providing them with shelter and food, even though in World War II, the Al-Atf power station was used to generate electricity for Lower Egypt and the Ahmouda Canal canal, which connects drinking water to Alexandria, Abu Homs, and Kafr al-Dawwar, were strategic targets of Hitler's planes.  Geography  Boats were facing the sea waves, which exposed them to drowning. The boats were jammed by the intensity of the commercial traffic on the coast of the island of Ful Al-Madina. The city promoted commercially and had commercial and navigational agencies, especially during the first and second world wars. The Mahmoudiyah Center was famous for the agriculture of rice and cotton, which was transported through the Mahmoudiyah Canal to be exported to Europe. This city was one of the major commercial cities in Lower Egypt for its unique geographical location. The Nile to its north was as wide as a natural harbor, and to its east is the mouth of the Mahmoudiyah Canal. In addition to the presence of a pump station to raise the Nile water to the canal that supplies several cities in the West Delta, including Alexandria.  Climate  K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), but due to its closeness to the northern coast of Egypt, its temperatures are moderated by the prevailing winds of the Mediterranean Sea.

Plot The story follows the troubled lives of three young robbers. The first is a college dropout, and draft dodger, who plans to rob a supermarket so he can purchase a boat and escape his problems. The second is an indebted man who is responsible for the high medical bills of a con woman who hurt herself while on a date with him. The third is a pathological liar who cannot cope with his failed marriage and writing career. During the robbery, the dropout gets too wired and kills the manager. They flee, but the dropout's cohorts are captured by the cops while he steals a truck and heads screaming down the road for Mexico. A chase ensues until the truck's brakes fail and he suffers a fatal, fiery crash.

Bivalves: Anodontites trapesalis; Paxyodon syrmatophorus; Mycetopoda pittieri. Gastropods: Pomacea doliodes; Megalobulimus oblongus. Location of Venezuela The non-marine molluscs of Venezuela are a part of the molluscan fauna of Venezuela (which is part of the wildlife of Venezuela). Non-marine molluscs are the snails, clams and mussels that live in freshwater habitats, and the snails and slugs that live on land. Sea-dwelling molluscs are not included in this list. A number of species of non-marine molluscs are found in the wild in Venezuela. Historical background Studies on the knowledge of the Venezuelan malacofauna begin in the nineteenth century with the work of German malacologist Eduard von Martens around 1873 who published the first list of the mollusks Venezuela.Martens, E. von. 1873: die Binnenmollusken Venezuelas. Festschrift sue feier des 100 jaehr.Bestehens der Gesell. Naturf. Freunde zu Berlin. Three years later the German-Venezuelan Adolfo Ernst, taking as its starting point and extending Martens list, published a second list in 1876.Ernst, Adolf. 1876: Enumeraci√≥n sistem√°tica de las especies de moluscos terrestres y de agua dulce hallas hasta ahora en los alrededores de Caracas y dem√°s partes de la rep√∫blica. Apuntes estad√≠sticos del Distrito Federal. Caracas pp:77‚Äì85 Subsequent to these two pioneering nineteenth century works, only sporadic descriptions were published in foreign publications. It took about half a century for new listings of malacofauna of Venezuela to be published, this time by American H. B. Baker in the mid-1920s.Baker, Hocece B. 1923: The mollusca collected by the University of Michigan Williamson Expedition in Venezuela. Occasional Paper of the Museum of ZoologyBaker, Horace B. 1925: The mollusca collected by the University of Michigan Williamson Expedition in Venezuela Following Baker's work is beginning to make as many Venezuelan species descriptions and numerous national and regional listings including listings include: Adolfo Lutz, who in 1928 lists and makes observations on malacofauna Valencia lake and surrounding areas,Lutz, Adolfo 1928: Estudios de zoolog√≠a y parasicolog√≠a venezolana.

Diversity  Pomacea urceus family Ampullariidae member, one of the most diverse The Venezuelan malacofauna not marine mollusks is composed of classes Gastropoda and Bivalvia, presenting a greater diversity of species in the gastropod. In the freshwater gastropod families with more species are Ampullariidae (35 spp.) And Planorbidae (15 spp.). In terrestrial gastropods include Ortalicidae (35 spp.) and Subulinidae (16 spp.). Among the bivalve families with more species are Mycetopodidade (17 spp.) and Hyriidae (10 spp.) Regarding the introduced species, the largest number of species is between terrestrial mollusks, primarily on families Subulinidae (6 spp.), Limacidae (4 spp.) And Helicidae (3 spp.)P√©rez, Julio E., Alfonsi, Carmen., Salazar, Sinatra K., Macsotay, Oliver., Barrios, Jorge. & Mart√≠nez Escarbassiere, Rafael. 2007: Especies marinas ex√≥ticas y criptog√©nicas en las costas de Venezuela.

The vast majority of species usually live in areas calm water pipes or flooding of rivers and lakes. Many of the species usually have local distributions such as slugs and seven of leathers that often live primarily in the areas of cultivation in the north and the Andean region, However extend very widely distributed species that can be located throughout the country as in the case of molluscs Ampullariidae amphibians and within the family which include Marisa cornuarietis,Catalogo de la colecci√≥n de Moluscos del Museo de Biolog√≠a de la Universidad Central (MBUCV-XIV) Pomacea urceus (Guarura), Pomacea glauca, Pomacea dolioides. Among the highlights landshells Megalobulimus oblongus (Guacara). In relation to introduced species is noteworthy that some of it was spread widely by middle natural environment among them are: Achatina fulica (Giant African Snail), Arion subfuscus Subulina octona, and Thiara granifera Melanoides tuberculata.

He has spent most of his career as a litigator in Florida, along with serving as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami School of Law since 1989. He is one of the world's leading voices on the law of the Commonwealth Caribbean and the political economy of the wider Caribbean region, and his scholarly work and quotations have appeared in periodicals around the world.http://articles.cnn.com/2010-05-24/world/christopher.dudus.coke.profile_1_jamaican- extradition-robin-hood?_s=PM:WORLD He is also frequently used as a media consultant with international publications, including the Miami Herald and the New York Times, among others. Early life Rowe was born to Ira DeCordova Rowe, Q.C., O.J., viewed by many as the leading Jamaican jurist of the 20th century, and the president of the Courts of Appeal of Jamaica and Belize, along with a member of the Court of Appeal of Belize and of the Bahamas. Rowe's mother, Audrey Stewart, was a sister tutor at the Nursing School of the University of the West Indies. Rowe attended the Wolmer's School in Kingston (established 1729), where he was awarded the Sydney McDonald Award upon graduation. Education In 1977, Rowe received the Exhibition Scholarship of Law from the University of the West Indies. He received his L.L.B. from the University of the West Indies (UWI) at Cave Hill, Barbados, in 1980, and received his Juris Doctor from the University of Miami School of Law in 1982. He was also a Rhodes Scholarship finalist for Jamaica in 1980 and 1981. While at UWI, he was active in Amnesty International adoption group. Career Rowe is a member of the Florida Bar and the Jamaica Bar. He began his career as an associate at the law firm Greenberg Traurig in Miami, from 1982 to 1984, until he was hired by Holland & Knight. At Greenberg, he worked with former U.S. Ambassador Ambler Moss and former Florida Governor Reubin Askew. Rowe worked for Holland & Knight from 1984 to 1990, becoming a capital partner in 1988. At Holland, he worked with Chesterfield Smith, the former president of the American Bar Association, and Bill McBride. In 1991, he opened the law firm of David Rowe, P.A. Rowe has had success in federal and state court. He obtained acquittals in notable federal cases such as United States v. Joel Powell and United States v. Hargitay, along with state cases such as State of Florida v. Lucille Sapp and State of Florida v. Sean Perry. Rowe's expertise has seen him called as a witness to testify on the country conditions in Jamaica in several political asylum cases. He was the first Chairman of the American Bar Association Caribbean Law Committee. He testified as an Expert in United States federal practice in the case of Dabdoub v. Vaz, the historic dual- citizenship case in the Jamaica Supreme Court. Rowe's first major criminal trial in US Federal Court was the landmark four-week trial of Nigel Bowe before Judge Lawrence King. Rowe used the Specialty Rule to dismiss 14 of the 15 charges. Bowe served eight years in Federal detention, far fewer than the life sentences requested by federal prosecutors. In 2011 Rowe represented Jamaican entertainer Moses Davis (Beenie Man) after Davis's visa was canceled by the United States Consulate in Jamaica. The visa was restored and Beenie Man issued a press release thanking Rowe on July 27, 2011. Rowe has been relied upon in U.S. Federal Court as an Expert Witness on Jamaican political and legal issues by attorneys representing clients facing Removal. Rowe has also been an attorney of choice for Jamaican entertainers with U.S. immigration issues. In November 2013, the Jamaican-American Bar Association recognized Rowe as an \\"elder statesman\\" of the Jamaican legal community in the United States and for being a \\"singular pioneer\\" for the trans-Caribbean practice. In December 2013, Rowe was recognized by a group of leading Jamaican attorneys for his 30th year of membership at the Florida Bar, as reported in the Jamaica Observer At the end of 2013, Rowe spearheaded the launch of a program distributing computer tablets to underprivileged youths in the Whitfield Town area of Kingston, as a tribute to his father's humble origins and academic excellence; \\"There is no reason why Kingston cannot be a hub of technological development,\\" he said. Rowe was commended by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation for his community efforts. In early 2014, Rowe received a special award for commitment from the board of directors of Temple Beth Ami of Boca Raton, Florida. In 2014, Rowe was the lead defense lawyer in a prominent Florida first-degree murder case involving a \\"Stand Your Ground\\" motion.http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-03-14/news/fl-tyra-holmes-stand- your-ground-20140314_1_michael-holmes-stand-ground-ground-claim In early April 2014, Rowe commenced his representation of Damion St Patrick Baston in a landmark human trafficking case in US jurisprudence before Federal Judge Cecelia Altonaga, as the US seeks extraterritorial implementation of its domestic anti-trafficking policy. Rowe's defense was noted by the Miami Herald, when he argued that it was not a question of prostitution, but rather that there had been no coercion of any kind. Since prostitution in Australia was legal, he argued, the case was \\"much ado about nothing.\\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/07/01/4212981/miami-jurors-finds- jamaican-man.html University of Miami School of Law Rowe is an adjunct law professor at the University of Miami School of Law, having taught at the Law School since 1989. In 2010, the school announced it would be adding a second Caribbean Law course, taught by Rowe, Caribbean Law II, which would focus on articles for publication in the University's new Caribbean Law Yearbook, co-founded by Rowe. Rowe coordinated the school's annual Marcus Garvey Seminar from 1999 to 2004, which commented on the teachings of Marcus Garvey and his legal and political philosophy. The seminar resumed at the University of Miami in the fall of 2012. At that seminar, Rowe called for a full presidential pardon for Garvey and called for the Jamaican government to have a portrait of Garvey in all government offices.http://www.caribjournal.com/2012/11/29/remembering-marcus-garvey-in- miami/ In 2013, at the invitation of Rowe, Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Stephen Vasciannie visited the law school and gave a lecture on the durability and stability of the Jamaican constitution.http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/04/30/jamaican-ambassador-to- united-states-visits-university-of-miami// In 2014, Rowe chaired the seventh Marcus Garvey Seminar, focused on Garvey's philosophy of Pan-Africanism and the history of its connection to constitutional development in the Commonwealth Caribbean. U.S.-Jamaica extradition crisis Rowe was one of the most outspoken advocates of the United States' stance in the Christopher Coke extradition crisis that began in the fall of 2009.http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2010/03/02/us_questions_jamaicas_reliability_in_drug_fight During the crisis, he was a leading speaker on the issue, with his commentary appearing in news outlets such as the BBC, Radio Russia and Time Magazine. He also convened a symposium, the Caribbean Law Yearbook Conference, in November 2010, that was the first formal academic discussion of the events of the crisis. Rowe is a strong political supporter of the viability of the Westminster constitutional model, which prevails in Caribbean constitutions of the English-speaking West Indies. He is a vocal advocate of significant United States economic support and diplomatic influence in the Caribbean region. Rowe endorsed the literal interpretation of treaty text during the crisis: he said the country should adhere to its obligations under the bilateral extradition treaty. In September 2011, he wrote an op-ed in the Caribbean Journal about Coke's guilty plea in US Federal Court in New York. Many observers partially attribute the resignation of Prime Minister Bruce Golding to Rowe's specific incisive and investigative criticism on Jamaica radio of the political scandals in Golding's troubled four-year administration. Transnational dialogue From 1984 to 1990, Rowe was the Registered Foreign Agent for Jamaica. While serving as Secretary to the Caribbean Research Development Foundation, Rowe, under the guidance of Sir Philip Sherlock, arranged for different Caribbean leaders to speak in Miami in the 1980s, including the Rt. Hon. Edward Seaga, Hon. Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, the Rt. Hon. P.J. Patterson of Jamaica and Sir Lynden Pindling of the Bahamas. With Hon. Marie Wray and Hon. John Atkins of the Jamaican Consulate in Miami, Rowe prepared the Draft Constitution for the Jamaica Diaspora Movement in 1990. Israel Rowe, who is of Jewish descent through his maternal grandmother, has been one of the Caribbean's leading advocates for Israel, both from a pro-Zionist perspective and for the potential role Israel can play in helping to develop the Caribbean region. Major Positions and Commentary Rowe's strong anti-corruption and pro law enforcement positions are reflected in his writings and lectures at the University of Miami School of Law. He has pioneered the development of the trans-national Caribbean Law program at the University which has encouraged exchange of scholarship between West Indian and First World legal scholars. Rowe's thesis that Commonwealth Caribbean Governments should try to operate with First World ethical standards has influenced both US and Caribbean policy makers. Rowe is an expert in the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its extra territorial application particularly in the Caribbean. Rowe has been qualified in US Federal Court on numerous occasions on the subject of political and legal conditions in the Caribbean. A law reform advocate, Rowe has publicly recommended that campaign finance legislation be adopted in the Commonwealth Caribbean to regulate political lobbying and make bribery of local politicians illegal;however, Campaign finance remains an unregulated legislative area in Jamaica today. In 2012, in a public lecture at the Norman Manley Law School in Kingston Jamaica, Rowe recommended that Jamaica adopt a Speedy Trial law to reduce its huge back log of criminal law cases and to expedite the period of time that incarcerated individuals in Jamaica have to wait for trial. Rowe has also condemned anti-homophobic domestic violence and violence to children in Jamaica, and has urged successive Governments in Jamaica to adopt corrective measures. Rowe is also an outspoken critic of the high murder rate in Jamaica, and relates it to connections between criminal narcotic elements and the political establishment in Jamaica. Rowe endorses the theory of Oxford Professor A. R. Dicey and relates his principles of the Rule of Law to the Commonwealth Caribbean. In his articles, Rowe supports Jamaica's membership in CARICOM and Jamaica's proposed affiliation to the Caribbean Court of Justice. Rowe has a strong pro-Israeli world outlook and is opposed to Caricom's recognition of Palestine in the United Nations. Rowe believes in binding political and economic bilateral ties between Israel and Jamaica. He has continued to campaign for a stronger bilateral relationship between Jamaica and Israel.http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/01/01/op-ed- jamaicas-mistake-on-israel/ He has also written several articles documenting the urgent need for campaign finance reform in the Commonwealth Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica.http://www.caribjournal.com/2012/12/21/op-ed- corruption-in-the-caribbean/ He has also written extensively on the issues of corruption in the Turks and Caicos Islands, originating in the Sir Robin Auld Commission of Inquiry and has become a leading voice on the legal and political developments of the Turks and Caicos.http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/02/14/op-ed-the-rule-of-law-in-the- turks-and-caicos-islands/ In November 2013, speaking with Newstalk 94, a major Jamaican radio program, Rowe argued that, despite the Westminster Model and the two-party system, Section 80 of the Jamaican Constitution accommodated the possibility of Jamaica having a splintered, or \\"coalition\\" Opposition. He also said the Governor General would always be obligated to determine which party other than the ruling party had the largest number of members of parliament. This obligation, he said, existed independent of internal party relations or elections. In a later interview with Newstalk, Rowe addressed the question of whether a Senator should resign after engaging in an ultimately unsuccessful challenge for leadership of the political party nominating him. He suggested that there was a Constitutional Convention in the Jamaican Constitution to the effect that a Senator should resign if there was evidence of a lack of confidence expressed in him or her by the Prime Minister or the Opposition Leader, because of the essential nature of the Senate as an upper house. He cited the derivative relationship of the Senate with the House of Lords and the Westminster model origin of the Jamaican constitution as a basis for his legal reasoning. Two days later came the resignation of former Senator Dr Christopher Tufton in a similar circumstance.http://go- jamaica.com/news/read_article.php?id=49279/ In a December 2013 Op-Ed in Caribbean Journal, Rowe identified the continued increase in the murder rate in Jamaica as a national crisis which required aggressive action by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller. An address by the Prime MInister a week later reflected what seemed to be a policy shift by Simpson Miller on the crime problem. In April 2014, Rowe was an outspoken opponent of a controversial measure introduced by the Jamaican government that would have levied a tax on all withdrawals from banks. Within a week after he published a scholarly Video Op-Ed criticizing the government's thinking on the matter, the government announced that it would be withdrawing the tax. Caribbean Basin Security Initiative Rowe is an outspoken advocate of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and the fight against transnational crime. In an interview with WLRN in September 2013, Rowe pointed to a Jamaican murder rate that was still \\"out of control\\".http://wlrn.org/post/why-jamaicas-falling-crime-rate-cant- last-without-rising-employment/ On Monday, October 7, 2013, Rowe appeared on the Independent Talk program on Jamaica's Power 106 to discuss the impact of the Shanique Myrie case in the Caribbean Court of Justice. He said the decision also had to be jurisprudentially assessed in the framework of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, which sees drug smuggling as the biggest single threat to the domestic security of the region.https://twitter.com/indtalk/status/387190362470498304/ He pointed out the US case Bell v Wolfish, sets a standard of reasonable grounds for performing cavity searches was established, and recommended that the Bell standard be employed by Caribbean governments. On Tuesday, October 8, 2013, in an interview with RJR 94 FM, Rowe emphasized the need for Commonwealth Caribbean governments to comply with the terms of the CBSI and its provisions relating to illicit drug trafficking and citizen security. Expert Witness Due to his internationally acknowledged expertise on political, human rights and constitutional developments in Jamaica, Rowe has become a leading expert witness in United States federal court cases involving Jamaica and more recently in cases in the United Kingdom as well. Most recently, he served as an expert witness on country conditions in Jamaica for the International Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. His expert testimony for that clinic played a role in helping to save a Jamaican man from likely deportation and torture.http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/human-rights-clinic- saves-jamaican-man-deportation-likely-torture/ Also in 2013, he assisted the Center for Applied Legal Studies at the Georgetown University Law Center in a major case involving Jamaican country conditions. In July 2013, Rowe testified as an expert witness in the landmark dual citizenship case in the Cayman Islands involving Cayman Cabinet Minister Tara Rivers. Rowe testified that a US passport application was not simply an administrative act, but was an affirmation of allegiance to the United States.http://caymannewsservice.com/politics/2013/07/18/us-experts-battle-it- out/ In December 2014, Rowe contributed expertise to a case involving the question of whether a removal of a Jamaican national back from the United States to Jamaica could be prevented under the terms of the United Nations Convention on Torture. In 2015, in what could become a landmark case for immigration law with respect to Jamaican political asylum seekers and withholding and removal, Rowe testified to the political affiliation of many gangs in Jamaica. Rowe's testimony was cited by the Immigration Judge as crucial to his that a Jamaican national was entitled to asylum, fearing political violence against his family. In Re Glasford Davis could become a seminal case in future Jamaican asylum proceedings. Rowe was called as an expert witness by noted Miami attorney Kenneth Panzer. In the summer of 2016, Rowe offered expert opinion in written testimony in a United Kingdom immigration tribunal involving the issue of an asylum request by a Jamaican national in England. Caribbean Law Yearbook Rowe helped found the Caribbean Law Yearbook at the University of Miami School of Law, the first journal in the United States focusing entirely on the law of the Commonwealth Caribbean, which will be published in the spring of 2011. It was the subject of the 2011 Caribbean Law Yearbook Conference, which was aired on Jamaican television, and was addressed by the Hon. Peter Phillips, Jamaica's current Minister of Finance. Publications In addition to his legal and political commentary, his work has been published in news outlets and journals, including \\"Debt Equity Reduction\\" in the International Law Yearbook and \\"The Abandonment Doctrine or Is Your Green Card Safe?\\" in the Jamaica Gleaner. He also has a regular column in the Jamaica Sunday Herald, and authored the article \\"Trial By Jury: Is Trial by Jury protected in the Jamaican Constitution\\". Fundamentally influenced by the writings of Professor Ralph Carnegie, Lord Diplock and his father Ira D. Rowe, David Rowe has theorized in several articles that the retention of the Westminster Model Constitution is essential to peace and stability in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Rowe is also a frequent Op-Ed contributor to the Caribbean Journal news site.http://www.caribjournal.com/?s=david+rowe+&x;=0&y;=0 /// Books Rowe is the author of Ira Rowe: Caribbean Lawyer, which examines the life and career of his father from his beginnings as a Clerk of the Court to his rise to the presidency of the Court of Appeal of Belize and of Jamaica.http://www.constitution-and-rights.com/ira-rowe-caribbean-lawyer.html It also takes the memories of those who knew him, including the Queen of England, who personally expressed her condolences upon his death through her Chief Clerk, Gill Middleburgh. In 2009 he published a short novella of Jamaican life called School Days, which examines racial and social attitudes in contemporary Jamaica. In 2013, Rowe co-authored, with Niyala Harrison and Jason Frederick Emert, the authoritative \\"Aspects of Jamaican Constitutional History,\\" the first detailed legal analysis of the history of Jamaica's constitution. The book focuses on the application of the Westminster model to past and current Jamaican constitutional issues.https://www.amazon.com/Aspects-Jamaican-Constitutional-History- David/dp/1484902564/ The book was launched in Miami and Kingston in May 2013, including an event at the Hotel Four Seasons in Jamaica and subsequently distributed with a launch in Southeast St. Andrew a month later.http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130526/news/news2.html In attendance were Kingston Mayor Angela Brown-Burke, constitutional scholars Abe Dabdoub and Dr. Lloyd Barnett and Ambassador Arnold Foote, current president of the World Federation of Consuls. In his speech at the launch, Rowe called for equal access to justice for all Jamaicans and use of the law to prevent violence to women and children in society. He also severely criticized the prevailing murder rate in Jamaica as being inconsistent with the Professor Dicey's Rule of Law concept. Rowe's book was described in a review by the Jamaica Gleaner as an \\"epic 451-page work\\" which \\"explores the key movements and events in Jamaica's history.\\"http://jamaica- gleaner.com/gleaner/20130616/arts/arts3.html Television Rowe is a frequent television commentator, including appearances on American Gangster (TV series) Most recently, he was a featured commentator for an A&E; special on the 2010 Jamaican extradition crisis and the prosecution of Christopher Coke. In January 2015, Rowe was interviewed extensively on an episode of 18 Degrees North, a Caribbean newsmagazine program, discussing the US-Jamaica relationship and issues relating to the synergy between US and Jamaican law enforcement.

The screenplay is by Joseph Stefano, best known as the author of the script for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. https://allmovie.com/work/eye-of-the-cat-90778 Plot Danielle, a rich, elderly woman, accompanied by her nephew, Luke, goes to a beauty parlor to get her hair done. While she is there, she begins to struggle breathing, due to two-thirds of her lungs being missing. When Danielle's beauty girl, Kassia Lancaster, sees this, she calls Danielle's other nephew, Wylie, who is with a girl when she comes to pick him up. Kassia takes Wylie to her parlor and explains that after she saw Danielle, or Danny as Wylie calls her, collapse, she got the idea to kill Aunt Danny by shutting off the oxygen supply in the oxygen tent she uses every night. Wylie agrees to do it, and then he hears a cat, which he is deathly afraid of after one attacked him when he was a child. Suddenly, Kassia sees an orange cat and tries to stop it, but it jumps onto Wylie, who throws it into a machine, electrocuting the cat. The next day, Wylie goes to see Aunt Danny, but leaves her room when he sees cats everywhere. He then talks to his brother, Luke, who has been caring for Aunt Danny, despite the fact that she hates him. Luke thinks that Wylie is there so that he can get Aunt Danny's inheritance when she dies, but Wylie just brushes it off. Wylie gets angry at Kassia for sending him to a house full of cats, but she says that she didn't know about them. Wylie forgives her, and the two sleep together. Luke finds out that Aunt Danny is going to leave all of her money to her cats, which shocks Wylie, and he convinces Danny to make him her heir and to get rid of the cats, which Luke does by luring them into a car with a bowl of meat. Later, Danny overhears Wylie talking to Kassia about her murder, but when she confronts Wylie he plays it off as a joke. Meanwhile, the cats begin to return. The following morning, the will is revised, and Wiley and Danny head out to breakfast. However, Danny notices Kassia in the window of her house. Wiley goes to confront her about wanting to see the will, and Danny moves her wheelchair down the sloped sidewalk. However, while trying to go back up, the wheelchair short circuits, and she becomes stuck. While they two are arguing in the house, Kassia notices Danny, and Wiley goes out to save her, but stops when he sees a cat, which jumps on Danny and causes her to lose control and start rolling down the road. Thankfully, Luke saves her just in time. Later, Danny wakes up in her bad and tries to tell the doctor that Wiley and Kassia are trying to kill her, but goes unconscious due to being given a sleeping pill. Kassia goes into Danny's room and tries to shut off her oxygen, but is thwarted by a hissing orange cat that appears to be the same one electrocuted earlier. When Kassia leaves the room, she sees a large number of cats come from the cellar and follow a trail of blood into Wiley's room. Wiley sees the cats and goes into a cataleptic state when one jumps on him. Luke pulls the cat off of Wiley, and when Kassia walks in, the two kiss. It is revealed that they teamed up to kill both Danny and Wiley, leaving Luke to be the only heir. While Luke takes Wiley into the cellar and then goes into Danny's room, Kassia picks up the bowl of meat used to lure the cats, and they cause her to spill it all upon herself. The cats attack her, causing her to run downstairs and into the greenhouse after the cats cut off her access to Danny's room. Meanwhile, Luke shuts off Danny's oxygen tank. Realizing that she is trapped and surrounded by the cats, Kassia slowly climbs up a nearby ladder, and a cat pursues her. When she reaches the top, the cat bites at her, causing her to lose her balance. The ladder topples over, and Kassia falls to her death. Luke hears the commotion and finds Kassia's body. When Luke approaches her, he discovers that Danny is still alive, revealing that Wiley had brought her into the greenhouse for \\"safe keeping.\\" She orders him to phone the doctor to say that Kassia's death was an accident. Wiley then walks in having come out of his paralysis, despite several cats being in the room. He tells Danny and Luke that he never intended to stay with them, and then walks out of the room, with Danny and Luke looking on in shock, and the same orange cat watching them from the ledge above.

Martin Center for Academic Renewal, formerly known as the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy and simply the Pope Center, is an American conservative nonprofit institute located in Raleigh, North Carolina \\"dedicated to improving higher education in North Carolina and the nation.\\" The Martin Center is one of several public policy centers underwritten by the Pope Foundation which has also contributed significantly to UNC-Chapel Hill as well as to other arts and humanitarian organizations in North Carolina. The Martin Center changed its name in January 2017 and is named after former North Carolina Governor James G. Martin. The Martin Center has attained the GuideStar Exchange Gold participation level, a symbol of transparency and accountability. History and organization The Martin Center originated in 1996 as a project of the John Locke Foundation (also founded by Art Pope), a nonprofit think tank concerned especially with free markets, limited constitutional government, and personal responsibility. In 2003, the then-Pope Center was incorporated as a separate entity. The current president of the Martin Center is Jenna Ashley Robinson. The previous president was Jane S. Shaw, who retired in February 2015. The director of research at the Martin Center is George Leef, and its director of policy analysis is Jay Schalin. Schalin studied Computer Science at New Jersey's Richard Stockton College and Leef is the former Vice-President of the John Locke Foundation.  Activities  The Martin Center describes its role as a \\"watchdog\\" with respect to higher education in the United States in general and the public system in North Carolina in particular.http://www.johnlocke.org/acrobat/articles/inquiry22-womensstudies.pdf The Martin Center makes available on its website many of the research and policy papers authored by its staff, including reports on campus speech codes, faculty teaching loads, general education programs, and privately funded university academic centers. The Martin Center's commentaries and research papers have called for budget cuts to the UNC system and for increasing faculty teaching loads and eliminating teaching reductions for administrators. The Center's director of research, George Leef, has argued for cuts in funding for the university system generally, and to eliminate the public subsidies for the state's scholarly press (the University of North Carolina Press), terming it a \\"boondoggle\\". In its broadest aim, the Center has argued for \\"renewal of the university\\", advocating the creation of privately funded academic centers, which, in their view, would offer balance to academic courses. Their strongest opposition campaign to date, conducted in conjunction with another Pope-funded think tank, the Civitas Institute, was directed against Gene Nichol, former President of the College of William and Mary and former Dean of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Law, in his role as the director of UNC Chapel-Hill's Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity.https://newrepublic.com/article/121062/north- carolina-republicans-battle-uncs-gene-nichol-poverty-center The Pope Center accused Nichol of partisanship and financial opacity. In 2015, the UNC Board of Governors concluded that the center was unable to demonstrate any appreciable impact on poverty and did not enhance the educational mission of the university and voted to close the Poverty Center.http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20150302/ARTICLES/150309973?p=2&tc;=pg The work of the Martin Center and its staff has received praise and support from other conservative or libertarian organizations and publications with an interest in educational issues. The Center has also been criticized by faculty in the North Carolina university system and from journalists and commentators outside the sector.

He is best known for his role in establishing one of the first Native American Studies programs (at University of California Davis). In addition, he was one of the co-founders of D-Q University, the first Native American college located outside a reservation. Life and career Jack D. Forbes was born in 1934 in Long Beach, California, to parents of Powhatan-Renap√© and Lenape descent from New Jersey. These were both historically Algonquian- speaking peoples of the Atlantic coastal areas. Forbes was raised in neighboring El Monte and Eagle Rock, where he began his writing career at the high school newspaper. He received his bachelor's degree in Philosophy from University of Southern California in 1953, going on to a Master's in 1955 and a Ph.D. in History and Anthropology (1959). In the early 1960s, Forbes became active as an organizer in the Native American movement, which asserted the rights to sovereignty and resisting assimilation into the majority culture. Native Americans on the West Coast were active, gaining national attention with such demonstrations as the occupation of Alcatraz Island. They pushed for better education, and departments of Native American studies to be established at major universities, as well as civil rights. In this same era, various tribes filed land claim suits against the federal government or states over long-contested issues. Forbes first taught at San Fernando Valley State College and the University of Nevada, Reno. He joined the University of California, Davis in 1969, where he helped found a program in Native American studies, one of the first at a major university. Later he developed this subject as a full department and served as its chairman.Seven Stories Press With an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, he explored the confluence of African American and Native American histories, as well as multicultural people of Indian and European ancestry. He extended his work into African American and Latin American history.Arica L. Coleman, Ph.D., \\"The Red and the Black: Remembering the Legacy of Jack D. Forbes\\" , Indian Country Today, 23 February 2014, accessed 12 May 2015 After gaining professor emeritus status in 1994, Forbes continued to teach at the university until 2009. In 1971 Forbes was among the founders of the Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University (commonly referred to as D-Q University), a two-year college located near Davis, California. It was the first tribal college in California and closed for classes in 2005. Forbes taught there for 25 years and served on the board. In 2015 it is continuing to work to re-open. He was a visiting Fulbright Professor at the University of Warwick in England, where he also spent time at Oxford and the University of Essex. Additionally, he held the Tinbergen Chair at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam.Biographical sketch], Jack Forbes' blog In the early 1990s, Forbes was involved with David Risling and others in the making of A Free People, Free To Choose, a film by Jan Crull, Jr.W.G.A.W. Reg. No. 513853 It was conceived as a feature-length documentary based on D-Q University's history and an alleged campaign by the federal government to suppress it. Crull was forced to abandon the project when Morrison & Foerster, a law firm closely linked to D-Q U's legal battles, withdrew from the project after the film's subjects filed lawsuits against each other. The hundred-plus hours of footage assembled includes a lengthy interview with Forbes.Four videotapes (VHS format) stored within the Native American Studies Department of the University of California at Davis by Jack Forbes in February of 1994 - #1 Jack Forbes Interview, titled \\"Indians' Plight: D-Q University vs. the United States Government\\" (running time: 2 h 37 min 48 s): a) opens with the Vigil Film logo/symbol/trademark; b) then \\"toaster\\" generated rolling commentary introducing Jack Forbes and the issues in brief, identifying the filmmaker Jan Crull, Jr., giving the time (the afternoon of October 8, 1993) and the locale which all fade into panoramic shots of \\"Cal-Davis\\", ending with a centering on one classroom building, next a close up of one of its windows which has a male looking out of it into the camera, followed by a close up of the man's face that transforms into a drawing with letters subsequently appearing individually and horizontally below the drawing and spelling out Jack Forbes; c)the drawing becomes animated (changes into Forbes' actual face) with Forbes facing the camera and raising a question which begins the 2 1/2 hours answer. After approximately a pause of 72 seconds following the interview there is a clip of the interview wherein the filmmaker uses Forbes' voice and relies on insertions of varied mediae germane to what Forbes is relating--e.d. note, probably as a means of experimentation so that the viewer will not see and hear a perpetual talking head (running time: 15 min., and 3 sec.) #2 and #3 videotapes are the filming of an interview with David Risling, conducted on October 6 and 7, 1993. The effect which Risling creates before the camera is that of the traditional Native American storyteller: He provides a history of himself, his involvement with Indian rights, and his relationship with and stewardship of D-Q University; and an account is also provided by him of what had occurred with the U.S. government (living while under FBI scrutiny). The Risling interviews show how the history of D-Q University is intertwined with the turbulent 1960's and 1970's Native American struggle to achieve rights (The American Indian Movement, Dennis Banks, Jerry Brown, Peter Mathiessen and other names of individuals and institutions/entities are mentioned). (running times: #2 - 3 h 14 min 22 s; and #3 - 2 56 min 41 s) #4 is a video tape (VHS format) of Jan Crull, Jr. explaining why he is making A Free People, Free To Choose and its many problems in spite of there already being distribution in place. (running time - 48 min., and 17 sec.). Following his explanation is a film segment which appears to be a tentative opening for A Free People, Free To Choose.(running time - 11min., and 28 sec.). Near his retirement, he published Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red- Black Peoples (1993), considered by many to be \\"his signature work\\", the product of two decades of study. He studied the fluidity of race in the United States as people came together in colonial times and after the Revolution, remarking on the fact that Native Americans who were part black often lost their culture and were classified arbitrarily as black, while identifying as Indian. Marriage and family He married and had two children, Kenneth Forbes and Nancy (Forbes) O'Hearn. After he and his wife divorced, he later married again. His second wife Carolyn Forbes, children and grandson survived him.

It stars Fred Williamson in the title role of a courier and Byron Webster. The film combined several genres: blaxploitation, the martial arts film, and James Bond superspy films (with some postures featuring the tagline \\"He's Bonded\\"). It was filmed in Hong Kong, Macau and the United States and featured several martial arts experts in action: Mike Stone, World Professional Light Heavyweight Karate Champion, Kenji Kazama Japan Kick-boxing Champion, Emil Farkas, European Black Belt Karate Champion, and David Chow, Former California State Judo Champion. It was titled Operation Hong Kong outside the United States. Peter Crowcroft wrote the novelization of the screenplay. Plot Courier Jefferson Bolt is asked to take a briefcase from Hong Kong to Mexico City, but he is not told what is in it or the identity of the man who asks him, a man named Griffiths. Convinced he will get good pay and see a few good places, Bolt takes on the job, while looking out for anything suspicious. Soon he does find exotic places, beautiful women, and ruthless gunmen interested in the briefcase. Production Fred Williamson recalled that Universal Pictures signed him for three films featuring the Bolt character as a black James Bond, but avoiding the urban locations of blaxploitation films. One director was replaced to make the film look more like a globetrotting secret agent film rather than a made for television movie. Williamson felt that Universal was not prepared to launch a film series featuring a black star. Though no other Bolt films were made, Williamson was paid for two films. p. 286 Paul, Louis Fred Williamson Interview in Tales from the Cult Film Trenches: Interviews with 36 Actors from Horror, Science Fiction and Exploitation Cinema McFarland, 6 Sep 2007 Cast *Fred Williamson as Jefferson Bolt *Byron Webster as Griffiths *Miko Mayama as Dominique Kuan *Teresa Graves as Samantha Nightingale *Masatoshi Nakamura as Kumada *John Orchard as Carter *Jack Ging as Connie Mellis *Ken Kazama as Spider *Vassili Lambrinos as Raoul De Vargas *Paul Mantee as Mickey Filming locations *Hong Kong, UK (today China) *Las Vegas, Nevada, USA *Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, USA *Los Angeles, California, USA *Macau, Portugal (today China) See also * List of American films of 1973 References External links The New York Times Review Category:1973 films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:Films directed by David Lowell Rich Category:Films directed by Henry Levin Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Universal Pictures films ","title":"That Man Bolt"},{"id":"29894575","text":"Pouteria eerwah is a rare species of Australian rainforest tree in the family Sapotaceae. Common names include shiny-leaved condoo, black plum and wild apple. It is endemic to south eastern Queensland, with a restricted distribution and regarded as endangered. There is discussion whether this plant should remain named as Planchonella eerwah. The tree was first described as Sideroxylon eerwah in 1894 by Frederick Manson Bailey, before being moved to its current binomial name by Baehni in 1942. The species name is derived from Mount Eerwah near Eumundi in Queensland. A genetic analysis of material found that Pouteria eerwah was most closely related to Pouteria cotinifolia, and Pouteria australis was a sister to the two species - the three forming a distinct group. Pouteria eerwah grows as a tall shrub or small tree reaching high with scaly bark on its trunk. It has leathery leaves with prominent raised veins which measure in length. Flowers and fruit can be found in any season. The flowers are a cream-green colour and hairy and are about 4 mm long. The dark red-purple to black fruit are oval to globular, measuring long, with three to five seeds. It is restricted to three locations in southeastern Queensland. It grows on rocky slopes in vine thickets and rainforest. Dominant associated species in southern populations include hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Harpullia pendula, and members of the genus Flindersia, and in the northern Argyrodendron species, Atalaya multiflora, Choricarpia subargentea, Excoecaria dallachyana, and Flindersia australis. Threats include overrunning of habitat by weeds such as lantana (Lantana camara), and in the Sunshine Coast glycine (Neonotonia whitii), corky passionflower (Passiflora suberosa), and umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla). Feral pigs eat the fruit and seeds.

Accessed 23 December 2011. was a German World War II soldier who allegedly escaped from a Soviet Gulag camp in Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia. His supposed experiences were the basis for a book, a television series, and a film. Strong evidence has been produced showing that Rost's story did not happen and really is _eine Faelschung_ (= a fake or a fraud). Life Rost was born on 27 March 1919 in Kufstein, Tyrol, Austria. He was living in Munich when the Second World War broke out, and during the war, he was captured by the Soviet Army. By his own statement, made in 1942, he held the rank of private, although Clemens Forell, his alias in his novel, was depicted as a Wehrmacht officer. According to the Munich registration office, Rost returned from war imprisonment in Russia on 28 October 1947. In 1953, he started working in the in-house printing division of the Franz Ehrenwirth publishing house in Munich. After ruining numerous book covers, Rost said that he had been made color blind by being imprisoned in Soviet lead mines. Seeking an explanation, Ehrenwirth learned of Rost's supposed prisoner of war experiences. Sensing a good story, Ehrenwirth asked Rost to write down his recollections. Rost's script was of very poor quality, but Ehrenwirth was keen on the story and hired professional writer Josef Martin Bauer to get the material into shape. (Suddeutsche Zeitung ‚Äì Online), accessed: 23 December 2011 Book Personal dedication of C. Rost in an early book edition Fearing a possible backlash by the post-war Allied authorities, Rost agreed to an oral interview only after being granted the use of the alias Clemens Forell. Bauer then processed the eight hours of taped material into his famous 1955 novel So weit die F√º√üe tragen (As far as my feet will carry me). In the 1960s, Rost used some of his recollections in his own paperback, Unternehmen Konterbande (Mission Contraband), but it was never printed or published. (Section Unbekantes Manuskript/Unknown script), accessed: 23 December 2011 Bauer‚Äôs novel, however, was translated into at least 15 languages and is still being re-published. (Amazon.de ‚Äì latest edition as of March, 2011.), accessed: 23 December 2011 Death Rost died on 18 October 1983 and was interred at Munich's Central Cemetery. True identity Almost 20 years after Rost's death, Ehrenwirth's son Martin revealed Rost's true identity to radio journalist Arthur Dittlmann, who researched the life of Bauer for a radio feature-documentary for the author's 100th birthday anniversary. (Sueddeutsche Zeitung ‚Äì Online), accessed: 23 December 2011 Doubts of the authenticity of Rost's claims Comprehensive researches, condensed in 2010 into a three-hour radio feature by radio journalist Arthur Dittlmann for the Bayerischer Rundfunk, left apparently fatal doubts about the authenticity of the events told in Rost's original story. For example, no prisoner of war camp existed at Cape Dezhnev in the Far East of Siberia at the time claimed in the book; Rost was not a Wehrmacht officer as depicted in the story; the German Red Cross, with headquarters in Munich, never received any inquiry about his whereabouts, which is unusual for a ten-year imprisonment; and Rost had been released from a Soviet prisoner of war camp on 28 October 1947, about two years before his alleged escape in 1949‚Äì1952, which he therefore could not have accomplished. As a result of this research, within Germany the book is now dismissed as a fraud. Additional errors include Rost naming the main street in Moscow along which he and his captured comrades were driven at the beginning of the novel as the Nevsky Prospekt, a street which is actually located in Saint Petersburg. Apparently Bauer, as the author of the book, failed to cross-check such unreliable, easily verifiable, details in Rost's story. Adaptations In 1959, Rost's story was the subject of a six- part television adaption, starring the German character actor Heinz Weiss. When it was first aired, it quickly became Germany's first television blockbuster. In 2001, it was remade as the film As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me, starring Bernhard Bettermann as Forell. Added to the story was a duel between Forell and a Soviet officer who was chasing him, ending in a showdown on a bridge on the Soviet-Iranian border. Many scenes feature characters speaking Russian and other foreign languages, without any subtitles; the intention was to convey to German and other non-Russian viewers the feeling of helplessness experienced by the protagonist with his limited knowledge of Russian.

Produced by Menahem Golan, written by Michael Blodgett, and was distributed by Cannon Films. The film stars Norris as Danny O'Brien as a cop trying to stop a serial killer, Simon Moon known as \\"The Terror\\". It is based on Michael Blodgett's 1982 novel of the same name. Plot Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) is a cop who likes to work alone and never waits for his back up. In Los Angeles, O'Brien is trying to apprehend the notorious Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran), also known as The Terror. Simon has been killing women by snapping their necks and taking them to his lair in an abandoned amusement park. O'Brien is attacked by Simon who almost kills him in the struggle. When the killer flees the scene and climbs up a ladder he slips and falls, knocking himself unconscious. When the backup arrives they think O'Brien caught The Terror and the people of L.A. call him \\"Hero\\". Simon is then arrested and taken to jail. When Dr. Highwater (Billy Drago) goes to visit Simon he escapes by cutting through the bars of his cell. He then steals a laundry van by push starting it but loses control and falls straight down into a cliff face. When the media hears about this they pronounce Simon dead and the people of L.A. are relieved. Three years later the murders start back up again and O'Brien thinks it's The Terror. He eventually finds his lair in a movie theater and heads in to confront Simon himself. He encounters an enclosed room not on the map and heads in. In there he finds the bodies of The Terror's victims and starts searching around for him. Simon jumps out and attacks him and Danny tries to fight him off. O'Brien eventually kills The Terror and the film ends, as he marries his girlfriend who gave birth to their daughter.

That determines everything in this business,\\" Norris said. \\"I like the character of Danny O'Brien and I like the relationships I had in the film, especially with Kay (played by Brynn Thayer). I liked seeing not just the man in the arena or the fighting machine you see in many of my films, but to see the man outside the arena -- the guy who also has relationships.\\"A NEW KICK FOR NORRIS MACHO MARTIAL ARTS MAN CHUCK NORRIS WELCOMES THE CHANCE TO SOFTEN HIS PUBLIC IMAGE IN HIS LATEST MOVIE.: [NEWS/SUN-SENTINEL Edition] Hurlburt, Roger.

There's a lot more here,\\" siad Norris. \\"What makes this a different film is the vulnerability of the character I play. There are moments of humor, romance and compassion, and there are moments of terror, anguish and anxiety.\\" A scene was filmed as a joke where Norris hyperventilates in the hospital and faints seeing a baby being born. The director, William Tannen, convinced Norris to test the film with the segment intact. \\"We did leave it in.

Chuck Norris fans will see the intense, focused sort of man, sure; also, I hope they will identify with the other side of his character, the multiple side...I trained really hard for this film. Jack and I did all our own fighting, and he's really strong. I threw everything short of the kitchen sink at him and every type of kick imaginable. People will believe that O'Brien really is facing a demon.\\" Reception The movie had a mostly negative reception. It currently has a 0% rating on movie rating website Rotten Tomatoes. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said that \\"With 'Hero and the Terror' Chuck Norris makes his most determined effort yet to balance his martial arts displays with serious acting. On a modest level Norris succeeds, only to be tripped up by an underdeveloped script.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post called the film \\"a typically slow and uninspired go-round\\", adding \\"it probably won't do any good, but here goes: Be very careful and avoid this 'Hero.'\\" Roger Ebert remarked that \\"A new Chuck Norris is unveiled in \\"Hero and the Terror,\\" which contains its share of martial arts combat, to be sure, but also shows him as a sensitive romantic who makes small talk over candlelit dinners and wants to be present for the birth of his daughter. There is nothing in the basic story of 'Hero and the Terror' that really requires Norris to reveal these tender new aspects to his character, but perhaps he simply put them in because he liked them.Norris is a gentle and intelligent man, and maybe he grew tired of kicking people in the face in the movies.\\" Box office Hero and the Terror grossed $1.84 million nationwide in its first weekend at the box office, finishing in 12th place for that weekend. The film made just $6 million overall.Lynch Party Los Angeles Times 15 Apr 1990: N27.  Release  The film premiered on August 26, 1988 in the United States.

Plot Claudia (Daphne Zuniga) is a successful trial attorney who graduated at the top of her class from Harvard Law School. She's working hard to become the first female partner within a high-powered firm. She believes her life is 'perfect'. Her sister asks her the day before to prepare for the family Thanksgiving a homemade apple pie. Claudia, however, is everything but the homemaker her sister is, and is annoyed by the request because she doesn't have 'time' for such things. Meanwhile, Claudia is directed to assist a corporate client in reversing an injunction so that it can demolish a park to build an enormous development. In order to realize this, she insists her subordinate employees work on Thanksgiving Day, because the court hearing is the day after. During this process, Claudia meets Gina (Faye Dunaway), a mysterious older woman who makes it her goal to teach Claudia some moral lessons. Gina takes Claudia to an alternative world, where Claudia is a lower profile happily married minivan-driving 'soccer mom' with two children. Claudia is perplexed by the situation she is now in, but while experiencing her new life, the way it could have been, she learns that she is missing out on a lot; despite past prejudice regarding married life, she eventually finds she's falling in love with the man to whom she is married, and she becomes accustomed to the new life she is leading. Furthermore, she grows closer to her sister. Just as she is about to settle with her new life, Gina returns to take her back. Claudia is reluctant to return to her corporate life, and thus must consider what she is most thankful for. Cast *Daphne Zuniga as Claudia *Faye Dunaway as Gina *Gina Holden as Jen *Dan Payne as Bill *Kennedi Clements as Amy *Catherine Lough Haggquist as Lindsay Production In a press interview, Daphne Zuniga discussed the film: \\"I loved the idea when it came to me. But I worked with the writer (Emily Baer) to make sure the message wasn't that this woman should have had kids and regrets it. Instead, my character is a woman who is hugely successful, about to make partner in her law firm, has all the money she needs, a great wardrobe...and then she gets thrown into a life that shows her what it would be like if she'd made a different choice.\\" An October 2010 press release from Hallmark Channel revealed that the film was set to premiere on November 6. Reception The entertainment magazine Variety felt the story provided a decent case for personal balance between having a career and a family. Added the critic: \\"...A perfect message for troubled economic times as well as the reflective aspect of the Thanksgiving season.\\" The Daily News expressed its disappointment in the film's \\"formulaic and uninspired\\" script, and furthermore criticized Zuniga and Dunaway for \\"hardly trying\\" to deliver a performance. The critic's discontent with the script was further explained: \\"Hallmark films are allowed some liberties with coincidence and unlikely events that service the plot, but this one exceeds its quota early. [..] A Family Thanksgiving leaves an uncharacteristically unpleasant aftertaste, because it ends up suggesting not just that Claudia is missing part of life, but that successful working women almost by definition must be misguided and miserable.

Founded in 2007 at Yeshiva University, Manhattan, New York, the 14-member group specializes in covers and parodies of contemporary hits using Jewish- themed lyrics. Their breakout 2010 Hanukkah music video for \\"Candlelight\\", a parody of Mike Tompkins' a cappella music video for Taio Cruz's \\"Dynamite\\", logged more than two million hits in its first ten days; the video has been viewed more than 14 million times as of 2018. They have recorded three albums and one EP, and frequently release music videos in conjunction with Jewish holidays. They tour worldwide and have performed at the White House and the Knesset. History The Maccabeats were founded in 2007 at Yeshiva University in Manhattan. The group adapted their name from that of the university's sports teams, \\"The Maccabees\\". The original group was composed of full-time undergraduate students, many of them alumni of Bnei Akiva North America. The group sang together privately for the first year, developing their repertoire, and then began appearing at campus events. They eventually hired themselves out to perform at bar mitzvahs, weddings, and other events in the New York Orthodox Jewish community. The Maccabeats released their first album, Voices from the Heights, in March 2010. This album, funded by a grant from the university, sold about 5,000 copies. In November 2010, they released \\"Candlelight\\", a Hanukkah-themed cover of Taio Cruz's \\"Dynamite\\" with a music video directed by Uri Westrich, a Yeshiva University graduate. The video, a parody of Mike Tompkins' a cappella music video for \\"Dynamite\\", was intended for the group's target audience in the New York Orthodox Jewish community but it quickly went viral, being viewed more than 2 million times in ten days. As of December 2018, it had logged more than 14 million views. The song entered Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart at #2 and the Billboard Holiday Digital Songs chart at #19. That same month, the song rose to #1 on the Comedy Digital Tracks chart. As a result of the video, The Maccabeats received major media coverage and requests for bookings nationwide. In January 2011 they performed at the Knesset. On May 17, 2011, they were invited to sing at the White House's Jewish American Heritage Month gala. President Barack Obama commended \\"their outstanding performance\\", in which they performed a barbershop quartet. The Maccabeats returned to the White House on December 9, 2015 to perform at the afternoon reception of the White House Hanukkah Party. The Maccabeats have attracted both Jewish and non-Jewish fans via the Internet and on tour. In addition to the United States, they have performed in China, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, London, and Italy. Members of the group lead Shabbat synagogue services for host communities. As of 2018, the group is no longer officially affiliated with Yeshiva University. Holiday songs The Maccabeats are best known for their Jewish holiday songs. These cover and parody contemporary hits while adding original lyrics written by group members. The lyrics are often educational, recounting the history of the holiday, mentioning pertinent symbols and customs, and using Hebrew phrases known to Jewish celebrants. Hanukkah Since 2010, the group has produced an annual Hanukkah music video. These include a cover of Matisyahu's \\"Miracle\\" (2011), with self-professed fan and Orthodox Jewish actress Mayim Bialik and her two sons appearing in the music video; \\"All About That Neis\\" (2014), a parody of Meghan Trainor's \\"All About That Bass\\", and \\"Latke Recipe\\" (2015), a parody of \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" by Walk the Moon. For Hanukkah 2016, the group produced a musical theatre parody called \\"Hasmonean: A Hamilton Hanukkah\\", featuring songs and music based on the musical Hamilton, rewritten with a Hanukkah theme. The video covers the songs \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" (with changed lyrics referring to the Hanukkah hero Judah Maccabee), \\"You'll Be Back\\", \\"My Shot\\", and \\"The Story of Tonight\\". For Hanukkah 2017, the group released a music video marking the 10th anniversary since their formation. The holiday- themed song, \\"Candles on the Sill\\", parodied Ed Sheeran's 2017 release, \\"Castle on the Hill\\". Purim \\"Purim Song\\" (2011) covers Pink's \\"Raise Your Glass\\". \\"Purim Song\\" charted in the top 10 of Billboard Comedy Digital Songs. Passover A 2013 music video featured a medley of songs from the musical Les Mis√©rables, performed over reenactments of scenes from the Passover story. The video included covers of \\"Work Song\\" (over a reenactment of the Jews' lives as slaves in Egypt), \\"At the End of the Day\\" (Jochebed putting the baby Moses in a basket in the Nile), \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", \\"Who Am I?\\" (Moses questioning if he is worthy to lead the Jews out of Egypt), the Th√©nardiers' section and the students' section of \\"One Day More\\" (the Ten Plagues and Moses speaking to Pharaoh), and the finale of \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\". A 2015 Passover mashup of \\"Dayenu\\" included eight different musical motifs, including doo-wop, polka, heavy metal, funk, hip-hop, \\"island\\", dubstep, and barbershop quartet. The 2016 Passover mashup included parodies of Justin Bieber's \\"Sorry\\", \\"Love Yourself\\" and \\"What Do You Mean?\\". Sukkot In 2012 The Maccabeats released a video parody of Psy's \\"Gangnam Style\\" titled, \\"What's next?

Their 2014 music video mashup \\"Home\\", filmed in New York and Jerusalem, covers songs by One Direction, Andy Grammer, Chris Daughtry, Diddy, and Phillip Phillips. In January 2016 the group covered James Taylor's \\"Shed a Little Light\\" in a joint performance with beatboxing vocal group Naturally 7 in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The music video was filmed at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where King delivered his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. Taylor called the performance \\"one of the best covers of 'Shed a Little Light' I've ever heard\\". Original songs For Hanukkah 2012, the Maccabeats released their first original song, \\"Shine\\". \\"Hanerot Hallalu\\" (\\"These Candles\\") is their bluegrass-inspired rendition of the hymn traditionally sung after lighting the Hanukkah candles. In June 2020 four members of the group released the song \\"Say Your Name\\" in honor of African-American police victim George Floyd. Music style While performing a range of musical styles, the Maccabeats' performance is strictly vocal. Members do beatboxing to imitate synthesizer, drums, and other instruments. Personnel Founding member Julian (Chaim) Horowitz is The Maccabeats' musical director and manager. The group was initially composed of undergraduate students, but by 2012 all members were in graduate school, most of them pursuing studies in fields other than music. Members have continued with the group after entering a profession, marrying, and moving out of New York. While all the members practice together weekly, only half the group travels to live performances, as their music is arranged in seven- and eight-part harmony. Music video director Uri Westrich is a Yeshiva University graduate. Following the success of his 2010 video for \\"Candlelight\\", he left medical school to pursue a career in filmmaking. He has directed all of The Maccabeats' music videos. The Maccabeats have a \\"clean- cut\\" look, performing in white dress shirts, skinny black ties, dress slacks, and knit yarmulkes. In keeping with the philosophical tenets of Yeshiva University, the group sees its mission as a fulfillment of Torah Umadda (Torah and secular knowledge). In the words of group member Ari Lewis, the group embraces the ideal of \\"living a life of Torah and Judaism, and simultaneously a successful secular life\\". Associated acts In 2012 four members of The Maccabeats ‚Äì David Block, Noey Jacobson, Nachum Joel, and Immanuel Shalev ‚Äì formed the short-lived a cappella group StandFour.

He was born at Hessle, Yorkshire and died at Winchester, Hampshire. Educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, Joy played as a right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm fast-medium bowler in one of the trial matches for the Oxford University cricket team of 1901, but was not selected for a first-class game. From 1906, Joy was employed as a tutor in the household of the Rajah of Dhar in India and then on the staff of the Central India College. In September 1908, he played in three first-class cricket matches for the Europeans team, taking 28 wickets in the three matches, including 10 in a match twice. In his first game, against the Parsees in the Bombay Presidency Match in Pune, Joy took seven Parsee wickets for 86 runs in the first innings, and followed that with three for 92 in the second for match figures of 10 for 178: the Parsees still won the match. He was less successful in his second game, against the Parsees again, this time in the Bombay Triangular Tournament, with seven wickets in the match including five for 29 in the first innings, but the Europeans won the match. Finally, in the tournament final, Joy had both his best match and innings bowling performances: seven for 24 followed by four for 50, for a match return of 11 for 74, and the Europeans won the trophy. From 1909, Joy returned to the UK and played a few matches in each of the next four seasons for Somerset, though with limited success. His matches in 1910 and 1911 all came late in the season, indicating that he had become a schoolmaster, and only in the last match of 1910, against Yorkshire did he develop anything like his Indian form, finishing with an innings return of five for 44 in a rain-ruined match. There were a further four matches in 1911 without success and in 1912 his sole appearance was against the Australians: he scored 6 and 7 and failed to take a wicket. That was Joy's last first-class cricket match. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1967 states that he was the father of Nancy Joy (Sylvia Nancy Wansborough, 1915-1997), who was prominent in women's cricket and wrote books about it. Wartime service Second lieutenant F. D. H. Joy was recorded by the London Gazette as having joined the Third Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers on 1 October 1914. In April 1917 (reported May 1917) he was recorded as a captain and as having been replaced on the special reserve. But later in 1917 he was back on the general staff as a captain. He was discharged with the rank of captain in 1920.

Precision marketing emphasizes relevance as part of the technique. To achieve Precision Marketing, marketers solicit personal preferences directly from recipients. They also collect and analyze behavioral and transactional data.Nelson, Scott. \\"Database Marketing, Part 1,\\" Gartner Group Research Report, August, 1996 Development The development of precision marketing coincides with the development of market segmentation, advancements in technology and the customer's reaction to the proliferation of mass marketing.\\"Why Relevance Drives Response and Relationships: Using the Power of Precision Marketing to Better Engage Customers.\\" 2009 CMO Council Zabin and Brebach portray the development of market segmentation. They describe the inception of the term in the 1950s and show that with time, increasingly more information was considered relevant for marketing purposes. Market segmentation evolved from simple demographics in the 1950s to geodemographics and behavioral segmentation in the 1960s (the propensity to purchase) to psychographics data in the 1970s (personality and lifestyle), to customer loyalty and profitability in the 1990s and to economic data in current times. The conceptual evolution of market segmentation is the cornerstone of precision marketing. In precision marketing, segments could be defined as narrowly as follows: full-time MBA students, married with young children, planning their next vacation. The evolution of segmentation was supported by advancements in technology. The shift into digital enabled an easier capture and retention of data while increasingly efficient databases facilitated the usability of that data. Although advancements in technology were crucial to the type of market segmentation used in precision marketing, they were not the driving force behind it. Instead, customer demand and expectation, alongside the fierce competition, were the driving factors. Learmer and Simmons (Learmer & Simmons, 2007) determine that American consumers are overwhelmed by an avalanche of over 3000 marketing messages daily Marketing messages increasingly penetrate the private domain both in print (direct mail and telemarketing) and in digital (emails and mobile phone). As a result, customers are becoming less receptive to unsolicited marketing communication, specifically if it is irrelevant or impersonal. This is the context that gave rise to the practice of precision marketing. Application The most common applications of precision marketing are in customer retention and revitalization. Here are a few examples for precision marketing tactics that have been used by several major companies, such as Best Western and Tesco.

Although little known now, he was considered second only to Paul Wittgenstein in the promotion of the left-hand repertoire. He commissioned works for the left hand from a number of composers, most notably Jan√°ƒçek, Martin≈Ø, Schulhoff and Foerster.One Hand Piano History and Repertoire He was also a composer in his own right. Biography Hollmann was born in Vienna on 29 January 1894. He initially studied as a violinist with K. Baumgarten. Some of his early compositions were published in 1915. On active service in World War I, a bullet went through his palm, injuring the metacarpus of the right hand but, contrary to some sources, he did not lose his right arm totally.Piano Music for the Left Hand AloneThe Independent, On the Other Hand, 6 August 1994 After the war, being now unable to play the violin, he took up the piano, studying left-hand technique with Adolf Mikas in Prague until 1924. He also studied composition with V√≠tƒõzslav Nov√°k 1925-26. He made his concert debut as a left-handed pianist in 1927, and later performed in a number of European countries. On 11 June 1926, Hollmann wrote to Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek asking for a work for left hand. Jan√°ƒçek did not respond, but he thought about the idea for some time. By 30 October he had composed a work he called Capriccio for piano left-hand and chamber ensemble, but the first Hollmann knew of it was when he read about it in a newspaper. Although Jan√°ƒçek apparently wrote the work at Hollmann's instigation, he gave no indication anywhere that he dedicated the work to Hollmann or even wrote it with him in mind as performer. Jan√°ƒçek even refused to reserve the first performance for Hollmann, although he was eventually given that honour. Hollmann premiered the Capriccio in Prague on 2 March 1928, with members of the Czech Philharmonic under Jaroslav ≈ò√≠dk√Ω.Nigel Simeone et al, Janacek‚Äôs worksJan√°ƒçek for Piano and Wind Ensemble Meanwhile, Erwin Schulhoff had written his Suite No. 3 for piano left-hand, in five movements, for Hollmann, who premiered it in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in November 1927.Donald L Patterson, One handed; A Guide to Piano Music for One Hand Bohuslav Martin≈Ø's Divertimento (Concertino) in G for piano left-hand and small orchestra was written for Hollmann in 1926-28. Josef Bohuslav Foerster wrote his Notturno and Fantastico, Op. 142 for Hollmann (written 1930s, published 1945). Other composers who wrote works for Hollmann included Jaroslav Tom√°≈°ek (Sonata for left hand, Op. 7, which Hollmann recorded), V√°clav Kapr√°l, Stanko Rajcic, Jaroslav ≈ò√≠dk√Ω, Josef Bartovsky, Ale≈° Jerm√°≈ô, and Vincenc Stastny.

It was the first forge constructed in northern Michigan; the site was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It is also known as the Jackson Iron Company Site. History Ariel N. Barney In the winter of 1846/47, the Jackson Mine company gathered materiel to begin its mining operations and to build a forge. Construction on the forge, supervised by William McNair, was begun in 1847 at a site on the Carp River, a few miles from the then-new Jackson Mine. McNair, however, knew nothing of forge construction, and progress was slow until forgemaster Ariel N. Barney arrived in July. Barney took over supervision of the project, and more progres was made. The forge site consisted of an dam across the Carp, with a waterwheel supplying power, eight fires, and a forging hammer. A small settlement, known as \\"the Jackson Location\\" grew up around the forge. The site was large enough to be assigned its own post office, the Carp River PO, in 1847. Construction continued until early 1848, and the first iron was made on February 10, 1848, by forgemaster Ariel N. Barney. These first pieces were sold to construct a steamer. However, in March, a wave of snowmelt carried away the dam on the river, and the forge remained idle until repairs were made in the summer. The Carp River forge proved to be financially unprofitable, due in large part to the difficulties of transporting both iron ore and forge supplies to the forge site, and, as Mining Magazine dryly put it, \\"both from the want and excess of water as a driving power.\\" The daily output from the forge was about three tons when it was working smoothly, which was rarely. The Jackson Mining Company operated the forge sporadically, and only until 1850. The Carp River post office closed in 1851. After that, the company leased the facilities to a succession of individuals and small companies, including a young Peter White, who would go on to become one of Marquette's most prominent citizens. All the lessees lost money, and the forge was closed for good and abandoned in 1854, having made \\"little iron and no money.\\" File:CarpRiverForgeMIc1907.png|Carp River Forge site c. 1907; remains of dam in the foreground File:Jackson Iron Company SiteNegaunee MI B.jpg|Carp River Forge site, 2010 References Further reading * External links *Michigan Iron Industry Museum Category:1848 establishments in Michigan Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1848 Category:Buildings and structures in Marquette County, Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marquette County, Michigan ","title":"Carp River Forge"},{"id":"29896402","text":"The Conejohela Flats are a group of islands in the flooded Conejohela Valley, a large floodplain along the southernmost 30 miles (50 km) of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and Maryland in the United States. The valley was flooded primarily during the early 1900s by the construction of the Holtwood, Conowingo, and Safe Harbor dams from 1910 to 1931. Geography and history Before the twentieth century, the Conejohela Valley was a marshy floodplain, with extensive wetlands. The Susquehanna River flooded annually in the spring, and there were more damaging floods approximately once per decade. Thick forests surrounded a mixture of small waterfalls, rapids, and marshes. A wide, flat valley formed; the frequently wide river was a substantial barrier to crossing, both for Native Americans and for colonists. The varied terrain created many nurturing biological habitats, but human passage across the valley and river was extremely difficult. The Susquehanna is very wide in this area, as it nears its mouth on the Chesapeake Bay. This stifled trade across the lower Susquehanna in colonial Pennsylvania and Maryland. In 1730, the Wright's Ferry was established to cross the river. Later the first Columbia- Wrightsville Bridge was built, once believed to be the longest covered bridges in the world. It was replaced by bridges built of structural steel, large enough to carry a range of vehicles. The modern bridge opened in 1930; it was dedicated in 1980 as the Veterans Memorial Bridge. Flooding Three dams were built across the Conejohela Valley during the first four decades of the 20th century to provide hydroelectric power for southern Pennsylvania (including electrical power for Amtrak and SEPTA Regional Rail) and to control the annual flooding. It was intended to keep sediment from the flats out of the Chesapeake Bay. The first dam across the lower Susquehanna, the Holtwood Dam, was completed in 1910 as McCalls Ferry Dam. The Conowingo Dam followed in 1928. The Safe Harbor Dam had the largest effect on the river ecosystem. When it first closed its gates on September 29, 1931, it flooded more than 10 miles of the upper Conejohela Flats, creating the artificial Lake Clarke. Most of the valley was flooded. The few islands that remain in Lake Clarke are a gathering of low, marshy flats about five miles north of Safe Harbor Dam. Habitat The remaining Conejohela Flats provide habitats for a number of species. The varying depths of inundated islands on the bottom of Lake Clarke support numerous fresh water feeder fish, pan fish, and large predatory game fish species. The Safe Harbor Dam has become a popular area for local fishing. The low-lying islands and riparian ecosystem also support dozens of species of birds; the flats are popular among birders.

It was built to supply Alexandria with food and fresh water from the Nile. History Prior to 1817 The first freshwater canal from the Nile to Alexandria was built under the rule of the Ptolemy I.Facts and Detals: Hellenistic period and the Ptolemies Ibn Batuta (1304‚Äì1369), the Moroccan traveller, in his \\"Rihla: My Travels\\", discusses passing through Alexandria in 1326 and references a canal from Alexandria to The Nile that was finished a few years before his arrival. This might contradict with Wali Muhammad Ali building it almost four centuries later. However, regarding the geographic location and the fact that this part of the land, which has been reclaimed not a long time ago, was plain desert then, the canal might have been covered in sand sometime before it was re-established, not necessarily following the same route, by Muhammed Ali of Egypt. The digging process On , Viceroy Mohamed Ali ordered to dig a canal from the Nile River close to Alatf village to deliver the water of the Nile to Alexandria through Beheira and to be a path for cargo ships. He ordered to group workers and tools necessary to start the digging work. During the digging process, some old houses covered in sand were found which had ancient boxes inside; some of them were opened and some others were sent to Mohamed Ali without their content being known. In April 1819 the work stopped due to plague. In January 1820, the canal was completed and named after Sultan Mahmud II, the Sultan of Istanbul, as Egypt then was an Ottoman province. After 1820 Within twenty years after the canal was dug, it filled with sand and became almost impassable, and it was only after Muhammad Sa'id Pasha came to power that it was cleansed and made navigable again. Postcard showing the Mahmoudiyah Canal A contract between the Prussian Baron de Pentz and the Pasha to use the canal for the provisioning of Alexandria in the first half of the nineteenth century came to an end due to a disagreement over the hoisting of a Prussian flag.William Harrison Ainsworth, The New Monthly Magazine, London: Chapman and Hall, 1853, pp. 3-4 In the 1850s, a new steam-tug company was formed with approval from the pasha to use the canal. Its board of directors included Jules Pastr√©, Alexander G. Cassavetti, Ange Adolphe Levi, Alexander Tod, and Moise Valensin. The pasha ordered the new company to replace the old locks with newer, bigger gates and to provide for the cleansing and upkeep of the canal. Map from the time of construction In the French Carte Topographique de l'Egypte,Nile delta in early 19th century, compilation of 18 from the 45 leaves of Carte topographique de l'Egypte (French), 1818 investigated while the canal was built, and published in 1818, the canal is called Canal of Alexandria (ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÉŸÜÿØÿ±Ÿäÿ© Ô∫ßÔª†Ôª¥Ô∫û ‚Äî Khalƒ´g al- Iskandariyya). In that map the bifurcation from the Nile is 20 upstream of the modern bifurcation and yet there are no totally straight sections.

The a550 also features a maximum of 7frame/s continuous shooting speed when operating in speed-priority mode and a maximum ISO of 1600 when in auto mode and 12800 ISO when in manual mode.Sony.co.uk Sony Alpha 550 The Sony Alpha a550 is \\"big brother\\" to the Sony Alpha a500, an almost identical DSLR with a smaller 12.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor, no 7frame/s continuous shooting and a lower resolution LCD. __TOC__  Live View  The a550 stands out from other DSLR's in its price range with its use of 2 separate Live View modes. The first mode operates in the same way other DSLR's do, by switching from using the main sensor to using a secondary, smaller sensor. This allows the a550 to autofocus in its first Live View mode. However this only provides a 90% view of the final image the main sensor will take. The second Live View mode is named Manual Focus Check Live View. This mode uses the main 14.2 megapixel APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor to provide a 100% view on the rear LCD. This mode does not allow auto focusing, hence the name Manual Focus Check Live View.CameraLabs Sony Alpha 550 Reviewdp review Sony Alpha 550 Review When in Live View mode the a550 uses its 3.0 TFT Xtra Fine LCD, with 921,600 dots which can be adjusted to point downwards, for overhead shooting or upwards for below eye level shooting. When Live View mode is not in use the optical viewfinder(OVF) is used and only provides 95% coverage of the actual image taken by the sensor.  CMOS sensor  The a550 uses a 14.2 megapixel APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor. It is a 23.4 x 15.6 mm APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor with an RGB Color Filter Array, Built-in fixed low-pass filter, with 14.6 million total pixels and 14.2 million effective pixels.center This sensor is capable of recording in 5 different File qualities / formats : ‚Ä¢ RAW (.ARW) ‚Ä¢ RAW + JPEG Fine ‚Ä¢ RAW + JPEG Standard ‚Ä¢ JPEG Fine ‚Ä¢ JPEG Standard and in 6 different image sizes; 3:2 ‚Ä¢ 4592 x 3056 (L) ‚Ä¢ 3344 x 2224 (M) ‚Ä¢ 2288 x 1520 (S) 16:9 ‚Ä¢ 4592 x 2576 (L) ‚Ä¢ 3344 x 1872 (M) ‚Ä¢ 2288 x 1280 (S)  Sony A550 Anti-Dust Technology  To help combat dust particles on the sensor from changing lenses, Sony included both an anti-static coating on the sensor filter and anti-dust vibrations to automatically shake the sensor with the anti-shake mechanism each time the camera is shut off. There is also a manual cleaning mode, where the camera first shakes the sensor, then lifts the mirror and opens the shutter, allowing access to the sensor for use with a blower or other cleaning device.  Sony A550 Autofocus The Sony A550 provides both manual and automatic focus control modes, set by the Focus Mode switch on the left side of the camera body, or on the lens. The Function button provides access to additional AF modes and AF Area options. The Autofocus Mode option under the Function menu offers Single-shot AF (AF-S), Automatic AF (AF-A), and Continuous AF (AF-C) settings. Single-shot AF acquires and locks focus when the shutter button is half-pressed, while Continuous AF mode constantly adjusts focus while the shutter button is half-pressed. The Automatic AF setting will lock focus on a still subject, but will switch to Continuous AF mode if the subject moves. Autofocus Area has three options available through the Function menu: Wide, Spot, and Local (manual setting). The default option is a nine-point Wide Focus area, where the camera selects which of the nine focus points is used. (Note that only the center point utilized a cross-type sensor sensitive to detail in both the horizontal and vertical axis. The other 8 sensors are line-type, sensitive to detail in one direction only, although the four line sensors at the corners of the AF array are angled, so they'll respond to both horizontal and vertical detail.) You can override the chosen AF mode by pressing the AF button in the center of the Multi-controller on the camera's rear panel, which will select the center AF point (the latter indicated by the target box in the center of the viewfinder). Wide AF bases its focus on the most prominent subject detail in the portion of the image that falls within the total AF area. Spot mode bases its focus on the AF point at very center of the frame. The Local setting is Sony's terminology for a manual AF area selection, and lets you manually set the main AF point by using the Multi-controller to highlight one of the nine AF points. The active AF area is briefly illuminated in the viewfinder during autofocus.photographyblog Sony Alpha 550  SteadyShot Stabilization  The Sony Alpha a550 incorporates Sony's patented SteadyShot INSIDE stabilization system which works with any attached lens. This uses a CCD-Shift system which moves the entire sensor platform in two axes. Sony claims the system is good for between 2.5 and 4 stops of compensation depending on the lens and shooting conditions, and like the entry-level Alphas it‚Äôs enabled or disabled from a menu option rather than with the physical switch of earlier models.Imaging resource Sony Alpha 550 Information.

Santa's reindeer return, but without Santa or his sleigh, prompting the elves to wonder (again in song) what has happened to Santa. Meanwhile, Santa has crash-landed on a beach in Dania Beach, Florida, gotten his sleigh stuck in the sand and been abandoned by his reindeer. Santa sings, bemoaning his troubles, then falls asleep. In his sleep, Santa telepathically summons several local children, who run to him and offer to help. Santa explains that they must find a way to pull his sleigh from the sand, as he cannot abandon it. The kids bring Santa several animals to pull the sleigh, including a horse, a donkey, a sheep, a pig and a gorilla. Meanwhile, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn watch and comment on the action from a distance. When all attempts fail, Santa encourages them not to give up hope, and begins to tell them the story of Thumbelina as an example. The film then cuts away to instead show Barry Mahon's previously produced film version of Thumbelina, in which a girl visits the now-defunct theme park Pirates World, hears the story in a Hans Christian Andersen attraction, and imagines herself as the title character. The Mahon film plays in its entirety, complete with its original credits sequence, and runs twice as long as the frame narrative (alternate prints use another Mahon fairy tale adaptation, Jack and the Beanstalk, as Santa's story). Afterwards, Santa again encourages the children to \\"always believe\\" and they go off to find help. Santa takes off his coat and again falls asleep. He wakes up to the sound of an antique fire engine, which is being driven by the titular Ice Cream Bunny, whom the children's dog Rebel has summoned. The Ice Cream Bunny drives the children through Pirates World to the beach. Santa puts on his coat to prepare to meet them. He thanks the children for their help and accepts the Ice Cream Bunny's offer to drive him back to the North Pole. Santa reminds the children one last time to always have faith as they depart. The children realize that Santa's sleigh is still stuck in the sand. As they wonder what to do, the sleigh abruptly teleports to the North Pole, where it will lie in wait for Santa's return.

The books in the genre also occasionally feature a murderer protagonist and are sometimes presented in a first person point of view. Tart Noir was labeled and effectively created as a genre by four writers during the 1990s, Sparkle Hayter, Lauren Henderson, Katy Munger, and Stella Duffy. Some of these writers have since collaborated on book signings and other events in order to promote the genre, along with creating a website called Tartcity.com. Style and requirements The storylines and characters described in a Tart Noir novel includes the necessity of a heroine who is \\"tough enough to take on criminals and cops\\" and yet still have the personality of being able to be \\"tender enough to love a man with rough edges\\". The requirements were described by Stella Duffy as the novel needing to be \\"maybe comedic, maybe violent, maybe sexual, definitely new-woman, neo-feminist, strong, smart and sharp.\\" History The four writers first met at one of the many writers conferences that they attended. It was during one of these times in 1999 that they \\"realized they were writing the same sort of thing\\" and discussed doing events together under the banner Slut Noir. Sparkle Hayter changed the named to Tart Noir and decided to create a website in lieu of doing events. When asked why they had decided on the name of Tart Noir for the genre, Hayter explained that slut was a \\"powerless word\\" and that \\"'tart' sounded like a lot more fun\\". After bringing other women into the webzine, including Jennifer Blue, Tony Fennelly, Max Adams and J.J. Buch, Hayter edited the launch issue, then moved on to other projects. Munger took over editing, maintenance and expansion of the website. Since its beginnings, the genre has grown to include more than twenty other writers who have self-styled themselves as writers of Tart Noir. This is shown by the fact that exactly twenty Tart Noir writers have come together to write an anthology of original stories in the genre, itself titled Tart Noir. The anthology was commissioned in 2002 by Stella Duffy and Lauren Henderson. One of those writers, Vicki Hendricks, describes herself as the first Tart Noir writer in the United States. Tart Noir was featured prominently in 2001 by Lauren Henderson at the \\"SheKilda\\" convention, which was the \\"first-ever women's crime convention\\".

The group's only album, it was released on CD and LP on November 2, 2010. The band 7 Walkers was formed in 2009 by former Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and guitarist and singer Malcolm Welbourne, better known as Papa Mali, along with multi- instrumentalist Matt Hubbard and bass player Reed Mathis. In 2010, after most of the tracks for their debut album had been recorded, Mathis went back to touring with his main band, Tea Leaf Green, and was replaced by George Porter, Jr., former bassist of the Meters. Porter appears on one track of the album. The lyrics for most of the songs on 7 Walkers were written by Robert Hunter, who wrote the words for many Grateful Dead songs. Willie Nelson plays guitar and sings on one track, \\"King Cotton Blues\\". According to the Austin Chronicle, \\"Kreutzmann refers to the music of 7 Walkers as 'swampadelic,' a natural meeting point between his West Coast psychedelia and Welbourne's voodoo-funk. Theirs is a saga of friendship and good fortune, set in the bayou but firmly entrenched in Austin.\\" The album is dedicated to the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans. Critical reception In Billboard, Gary Graff wrote, \\"... in 7 Walkers, Dead percussionist Bill Kreutzmann has hit pay dirt. The well-credentialed group ‚Äî fronted by Louisiana singer/guitarist Papa Mali and now including Meters bassist George Porter (who appears on only one of the debut album's 13 tracks) ‚Äî plays it loose and rootsy in a manner Deadheads will certainly find appealing, especially with Robert Hunter writing lyrics.... A fine soundtrack for Louisiana's continuing return to glory.\\" In JamBase, Dennis Cook wrote, \\"7 Walkers... is the most organic, original music to come out of the core Grateful Dead alumni since the passing of Jerry Garcia. It's worth getting right down to brass tacks since 7 Walkers goes for the creative jugular in such a lusty, exuberant manner. With richly imaginative lyrics penned by Dead scribe Robert Hunter... Even on paper this quartet is lethal, but that's nothing compared to the roiling energy when they come together in the flesh. With their collective pedigree, there's an enormous pool of possibilities and their self-titled debut reflects all their swirling undercurrents and coalesces into fascinating new shapes, fresh colors forming on the surface of things as dark, interesting eddies move below.

The presence of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa mostly consists of the importation of glass beads shipped primarily from the Middle East and Indian as early as 200-300AD; later, from Portugal, the Netherlands, and Venice. As most African cultures have long histories of crafting and adornment with beads made from wood, bone and shell, the introduction of glass as a bead material was widely and rapidly received. The exchange of glass beads for local goods such as ivory, gold and slaves aided in the accumulation of wealth and creation of unequal power dynamics still apparent today.Dubin 1987 Archaeological evidence, primarily from various burial sites from the West and coastal port cities in the East, confirm the import of hundreds of thousands of glass beads.4 Davidson 1972 3 These assemblages boast rich varieties in shape, colour, texture and patterning. While most Sub-Saharan glass was imported as pre-formed beads, there is evidence of the importation of glass fragments and ingots to be used in local beadmaking practices.5 Preliminary excavations also exhibit evidence of indigenous glass production from raw materials, a technology previously thought unknown to this region of the world.6 4, recent evidence has shown that glass making has been started separate from the general glass trade centuries before European and Arab contact Cultural and historical significance Symbolism As subsistence-level herding was common throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, bead adornment was an apt medium for self and cultural expression; whereas a more permanent art form would have proven impractical. Through various bead shape formations, colouring choices and assemblage methods, individuals were able to express complex information which was particularly useful in the absence of written language. Notions such as age, marital status and relative economic wealth were communicated through careful selection of symbolic glass beads. The remelting and reworking of existing beads also suggests that the shape and style of glass beads held specific cultural values; various regions were able to imitate more favourable foreign styles, create unique forms or produce much larger beads than what was available through international trade, effectively expressing local distinctiveness. 7 8 Glass beads also provided a means of connecting with ones ancestors. Known as Heirloom beads, these beads were typically translucent, resembling wax, having a discoid shape and usually could be dated back to the middle and late Iron Age. Whether strung as jewellery, attached to clothing or stored unassembled, Heirloom beads were extremely prized and often passed down from generation to generation. Additionally, glass beads have been linked to a number of religious and symbolic practices, primarily as offerings to deities at sacred locations and constructed shrines. 4 Beads as economic wealth Glass beads in Sub-Saharan regions were used as an economic tool, denoting wealth and political power. Yoruba kings, or Obas, often encouraged complicated and abundant glass beadworking as a visual symbol of their nation's wealth. Production of beads in great quantities could also be offered by Obas to various deities as a symbol of appreciation of such granted political and economic power. Aje Ilekes, discs of melted cullet (recycled material) glass with beads embedded, were produced by intentionally destroying and remelting glass beads, serving as a status symbol of power and wealth. Aje Ilekes are still used today as a monetary system, often exchanged as wedding dowry.4 In the archaeological record it is common to find numerous glass beads and beadworking tools such as stone anvils and crucibles included in burial sites suggesting the objects‚Äô cultural and economic importance.4 Importation and trade Early chronology Attempts to determine date and origin of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa have been made with varying success. According to recent archeological research in Nigeria, there is evidence that glass was locally produced in Igbo Olokun in the 11th-15th centuries A.D., (before European glass trade with West Africa). It is generally agreed that glass beads were present in the Sub-Saharan world by at least 300AD, some having been imported from the Middle East and South East Asian regions. Transported by sea, shipments arrived to coastal ports such as Mtwapa and Ungwana in Kenya and were then distributed inland via local trade networks and kinship relations.3 On land, glass bead cargos travelled through North Africa south to areas such as Gao in Mali, as well as Nigeria, Ghana and Benin. The expansion of the Roman Empire helped to broaden trade patterns and the introduction of the camel as means of transport significantly fostered the spread of imported goods. European nations entered the African trading market, beginning with Portugal, Italy and Bohemia in the 15th century, followed by the Dutch, English, French, Belgians and Germans. By the 17th century, the Netherlands managed to secure an impressive monopoly on the glass bead exchange with Sub-Saharan Africa. A Dutch merchant and entrepreneur named Sir Nicholas Crisp is recorded to have been awarded a patent ‚Äúfor the sole making and vending of beads and beugles to trade to Guinea,‚Äù in 1632.7 Trade wind beads During the Medieval Period, trade of a particular style of glass bead, the Trade Wind bead, dominated the market. These beads ranged in colour and length but could be mass-produced.3 Termed ‚ÄúTrade Wind beads‚Äù due to the use of monsoon winds for navigation, these beads were shipped throughout the Indian Ocean Trading Complex, especially to East, West and South African coastal ports. 3 India and Sri Lanka contributed greatly to the exchange of Trade Wind beads though it has been disputed whether these countries also partook in the primary production of glass used for such beads. The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most Trade Wind Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral- soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the Trade Wind beads found in Sub-Saharan regions. Slave beads European nations became increasingly involved in the glass bead trade with Africa which consequently aided in the foreign exploitation of natural resources, including slaves. Because Westerners viewed Africans as ‚Äúthe uncivilised of the World,‚Äù7 glass beads known crudely as ‚Äúslave beads‚Äù were commonly exchanged for human cargo which could then be shipped and traded for other desired goods. The residual effects from the glass bead trade had dramatically varying results across Sub- Saharan Africa. While most regions suffered economic and social hardship due to abusive foreign monopolies, some nations prospered from this interaction. Coastal ports serving as initial points of contact often benefited from access to imported goods, reaping profits from their own subsequent distribution to regions inland. Scholars have suggested that the rise of Empires in Ghana and Mali between the 8th-13th centuries, as well as the Kingdoms of Benin and Akan during the 16th century are intrinsically related to the access and distribution of foreign glass beads. 3 5 Bead manufacture Glass manufacture: primary and secondary glass production Primary glass production involves the combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass). Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed. The production of primary glass has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature). The addition of mineral deposits to alter the colour of glass can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production of glass typically involves processes of colouring, remelting, shaping and decorating of the glass object. While some archaeological evidence suggests the concurrence of both primary and secondary glass production at the same site, in the case of glass beads these processes often occurred separately. As access to premade glass and foreign colorants increased, beadmaking from imported goods developed into a technology which could be conducted in virtually any location across the globe.10 Beadworking The production of beads from imported glass shards, cullet (scraps) and undesired glass beads has a lively presence in Sub-Saharan history. Imported glass was either formed by melting such imported glass, potentially adding desired colorants, and then shaping the melt into a bead form; or, by grinding down the imported glass to form a powder which would then be shaped, heated and cooled. The archaeological evidence of beadworking in Sub-Saharan Africa provides examples of both types.5 9 Wound glass beads With melted glass working, beads found were generally formed by either a wound, drawn or moulded process. Wound glass beads, also known as Tubular, Cylindrical, Spherical or Melon-Shaped, were formed by folding molten glass around a metal rod called a mandrel. Once the glass had cooled slightly, the material was slipped off the mandrel and pinched and prodded until it reached a desired shape.9 Drawn glass beads Also known as Cane beads, Drawn beads were formed by dipping an iron blowpipe into molten glass and slightly blowing air through the pipe, allowing for a ‚Äúgather,‚Äù or hollow glass ball, to form at the end. A rod called a ‚Äòpuntil‚Äô was used to pull the gather into a longer, hollow form which would then cool and be broken into individual beads. As glassblowing technology did not exist in early Sub- Saharan African regions, locally produced drawn beads were made by trapping air bubbles in molten glass and then drawing the glass into a cane form.8 Moulded glass beads Little evidence of beads produced from moulds are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, however it is understood that beads of this form were produced by dropping molten glass into a preformed open clay mould and then ‚Äúpunched‚Äù with a core to take on the mould's form. Holes could then be drilled through moulded beads or, beads produced from half moulds could then be adhered together.9 Powder glass beads The glass beads of Sub-Saharan Africa that were not melted from pre-existing glass material were instead formed by grinding glass into a fine powder to be worked further. Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted. The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below). After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste. This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes. Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel. This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania. These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century. The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8 Lapidary beads Though technically made from glass, the lapidary style of bead production is more akin to stone working than proper glass manufacturing. This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired bead form. Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove. Glass remains that had been brought to the upper soil layers (either naturally or via ‚Äúmining‚Äù) were collected and worked to produce new glass beads.4 Colouring Colouring of glass could either be achieved by adding bits of pre-existing coloured glass, such as bottle shards or beads, by adding scrap metals, or by adding mineral pigments directly.9 The beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa generally contained the following pigment sources: Red was achieved by adding small amounts of metallic copper. The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour. To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent. Yellow and opaque white were created by the addition of antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well. While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources. Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3 Beadworking sites Archaeological evidence, coupled with historical documentation and oral tradition provide evidence of numerous Sub-Saharan beadmaking sites. Found Nupe beads from Nigeria suggest native individuals produced beads from scrap glass and bottles. Remains from the Ashanti region in Ghana imply beadmaking from moulds using imported powdered glass. Sites such as Gao, Mali and Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria provide evidence for the production of Carnelian Bead. It is not known whether the Carnelian was a local material; however, bead production has been confirmed due to the discovery of lumps of imported raw glass and other glassworking equipment.5 Mapungbwe, South Africa provides another example of beadmaking. This site dates between 600-1200AD and contains evidence of glass working from pulverized bottles, ingots and other beads. Primary production evidence The most conclusive archaeological evidence for the primary production of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from Ile-Ife, Nigeria, though finds in Gao, Mali, Benin and Ghana also support such inferences.4 Crucibles with glass layering and exterior vitrification indicative of production from raw materials prompted further compositional analysis. Archaeologist concluded that the glass found in the crucibles of Ile-Ife had a uniquely high percentage of lime and alumina compounds,4 a glass formula known only to exist in Korea. Importation of glass from Korea can be ruled out as this area only produced small quantities of glass, supplies no evidence of glass bead production and mainly only experimented with glazing.4 European, Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese origins for the glass found at Ile-Ife can also be excluded as none of these traditions produced glass high in both lime and alumina.4 It has been suggested that this unique high-lime, high alumina glass could represent an entirely new glass making technology6 in which the alkali (soda) and alumina were derived from separate mineral sources. The lime source would also have been added separately; most probably in the form of limestone, marble or shell.6 These proposed sources for lime, native to Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan regions, comprise a novel yet plausible primary production process. Neighbouring areas, such as the sites at Ita Yemoo and Igbo-Ukwu, contain glass working evidence such as crucibles, cullets, and beads, all with high-lime, high-alumina glass compositions suggesting the secondary production of glass imported from Ile-Ife.4 Whether primary production technology was learned and transferred from abroad or locally invented is unknown. Most reasonably, the presence of imported glass beads pre-existed primary production technology which was later developed through processes of trial and error.4 6 The invention of glass distinctive to Sub-Saharan Africa could have been spurred due to a shortage of imported glass beads as material accessibility and supply often directed the course of glass production technology throughout the course of history (See History of Glass).

He was based in Wagga Wagga for over 40 years and designed buildings in practically every district in the southern half of the state.\\"Heritage Branch - Up-To-Date Store and Garth Jones Collection Family and early life Born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Monks was the eldest child of Alfred James and Ellen Bowe Monks. He lived until his teenage years in the Pastoral Hotel, Wagga, which was owned and managed by his publican father. Monks had two younger sisters, Bessie and Nell, and a younger brother, Alfred. Monks remained single throughout his life and maintained a close relationship with his sisters and brother.William John Monks - Architect Education Monks' early education was at Wagga Wagga Public School in Gurwood Street. At fourteen, he moved with his family to Petersham, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, and attended Newington College from 1883 to 1885.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Sydney, 1999) p 24 Late in 1885 he left school and was articled to the Sydney firm of architects Stockham and Hassall; in the ensuing five years he studied at Sydney Technical College. During this period the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sydney held classes in architecture, and it is likely that Monks attended these with contemporaries such as Henry Budden.Freeland, J.M. The Making of a Profession, Angus & Robertson, (Sydney, 1971) pp 218 Architectural practice Monks returned to Wagga in 1890 and opened an office in space provided by his father at the Pastoral Hotel. His domestic designs were in the Federation Bungalow style (asymmetrical, single storey, verandahs, detailed roof, exposed rafters, casement windows) with a strong national identity. By the turn of the century he had established a design office in Gurwood Street, Wagga. Later, Monks employed Christopher Ernest Jeffs as a draftsman. Jeffs eventually became a partner and for a while the partnership also included Roy Ashley Shaw and was known as Monks, Jeffs and Shaw. In 1938, Monks retired.William John Monks - Architect Community involvement In his younger years Monks played cricket and tennis locally but was not a strong sportsman. He was involved with the School of Arts and the Murrumbidgee Pastoral and Agricultural Association and enjoyed hunting, shooting and fishing.William John Monks - Architect Heritage Branch listings The following buildings are listed by the Heritage Council or by Local Councils, Shires and State Government Agencies. * Up-To-Date Store, 127-129 Cowabbie Street, Coolamon, New South WalesHeritage Branch - Online Database * Hairdresser (Junee Barber), 21 Seignior Street, Junee, New South WalesHeritage Branch - Online Database * Home Care Service of NSW, 21 Seignior Street, JuneeHeritage Branch - Online Database * Junee Hotel, 21 Seignior Street, JuneeHeritage Branch - Online Database * Medical Centre, 34 Belmore Street, JuneeHeritage Branch - Online Database * Retail Shop, 21 Seignior Street, JuneeHeritage Branch - Online Database * St. Brendan's Roman Catholic Presbytery, 47 Langham Street, Ganmain, New South WalesHeritage Branch - Online Database File:St Michael's Cathedral (Church Street view).jpg|St Michael's Cathedral, Wagga Wagga (completed by Monks in 1922) File:St John's Anglican Church.jpg|St John's Church, Wagga Wagga (additions including belltower by Monks in 1912) File:CoolamonUptodateStore.JPG|Up-To-Date Store 127-129 Cowabbie Street Coolamon, New South Wales File:Wagga Wagga District Hospital.jpg|Wagga Wagga District Hospital Nurses quarters and kitchens (1908-1909) References Category:1869 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Wagga Wagga Category:New South Wales architects Category:People educated at Newington College ","title":"William Monks"},{"id":"29897224","text":"The Australian Performing Arts Collection at Arts Centre Melbourne is the largest specialist performing arts collection in Australia, with over 680,000 items relating to the history of circus, dance, music, opera and theatre in Australia and of Australian performers overseas.

He is best known for his Latin grammar textbook the Vulgaria, which created controversy at the time due to its unconventional approach in first giving examples of translations of English writings on different topics, and later discussing the rules of grammar. He asserted, probably following Quintilian, that grammar cannot be perfect without music. Life Horman was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England around 1440. He was admitted as a pupil at Wykeham's college at Winchester in 1468. According to some accounts, he studied at the University of Cambridge. However, in 1477 he was elected a fellow of New College, Oxford, in the same year that William Caxton printed his first book in England. He took a Masters of Arts degree, and in 1485 became the headmaster of Eton. He left Eton in 1494, and became headmaster of Winchester from 1495 to 1501. At that time, the Winchester post was more prestigious and paid better. Later, Horman returned to Eton as a fellow and vice-provost, where there is evidence that both Greek and Latin were taught. He continued there until his death. When he was almost eighty years old, in 1519 Horman published the Vulgaria, a Latin textbook. He says in the introduction that he composed the book when a schoolmaster, \\"many years before\\". In a contract dated 28 June 1519, he ordered Richard Pynson to produce 800 whole and perfect copies of these Latin texts, in 35 chapters. The contract is notable as one of the earliest surviving agreements of this nature. Horman became an antagonist in the Grammarians' War, which erupted when Robert Whittington attacked the new approach of teaching by example. Whittington at the time was England's leading author of textbooks, and preferred the traditional system of learning the precepts of grammar by rote before progressing to examples. In some ways Horman was more traditional than Whittington, since he rejected the common vocabulary of Medieval Latin and idealised the \\"pure\\" Ciceronian form of Latin while Whittington was more pragmatic in his views. Horman died in April 1535, when in his nineties, an extreme old age for the time. Work The Vulgaria is the more important of Horman's surviving works, a Latin textbook based on humanist principles published in 1519. The book was dedicated to William Atwater, Bishop of Lincoln. The preface of the book included verses by William Lilye and by Robert Aldrich, the master at Eton from 1515 to 1521. The name Vulgaria is used in the Latin sense of \\"common things\\", in this case \\"everyday sayings\\". The book is a collection of English sentences followed by their Latin translations, covering subjects related to school, manners, upbringing, religion, natural history and many other subjects. The textbook is not radically different from previous Latin grammars, differing mainly in its arrangement by subject rather than by grammatical structure. In this, it followed the principles laid out by Erasmus. The Vulgaria draws from a variety of sources, for example including the saying \\"It does no good for all truth to be told nor all wrong imputed\\" derived from the Old English Durham Proverbs. Another example of a proverb to be translated is \\"Somtyme of a myshappe cometh a good turne\\". The proverb \\"necessity is the mother of invention\\" appears, perhaps for the first time in English, translated as \\"Mater artium necessitas\\". Other sayings included the advice not to \\"offereth a candell to the deuyll\\", to remember that \\"many a ragged colt proued to a good horse\\", \\"it is better a chylde unborne than untaught\\", \\"manners maketh man\\" and \\"one scabbed shepe marreth a hole flocke\\". \\"That the whiche muste be wyll be\\" reflects the Spanish \\"Que Sera, Sera\\". The book gives practical advice. \\"At a soden shyfte leere [empty] barellis, tyed together, with boardis above, make passage over a streme\\". He says that alleys in gardens, covered with vines, \\"do great pleasure with the shadow in parchynge heat, and clusters of grapis maketh a pleasant walkynge alley\\". The Vulgaria is interesting in the light that it throws on the times. For example, the book is the first to mention \\"ceruse\\", a mixture of white lead and vinegar used by wealthy women to whiten their skin. The book defines blotting paper: \\"Blottynge papyr serveth to drye weete wryttynge, lest there be made blottis or blurris\\". Children's rattles are first mentioned in the book. He describes the use of wooden swords, or \\"wasters\\", used for training: \\"Let us pley at buckeler and at waster in feyre game\\". The sentence \\"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\\" (which Horman translates as \\"lusui erit nobis follis pugillari spritu tumens\\") is one of the earliest references to the game of football being played at public schools. He praised the value of sports in letting children find an outlet for their energy as a break from their studies: \\"There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren, leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none, or waxe slacke if they haue to many\\". Horman's Antibossicon G. Hormani ad G. Lilium published in 1521 is a riposte to criticism of the Vulgaria. It takes the form of a series of letters to Horman, and from him to William Lilye, another grammarian who supported the new teaching approach. Lilye also published an Antibossicum, and the two were published together as a pamphlet. In his Apologeticon contra Rob. Whittingtoni Protova tis Angli√¶ incivilem indoctamque criminationem, he dissected some of Whittington's poetry and treated it to severe criticism. Horman also translated several of the Greek classics and wrote various treatises on philosophy and science, but these have not survived.

The lodging accommodation is close to Yosemite Falls. The Lodge complex has a total of 245 rooms, located in a total of 15 separate buildings, including the main Lodge. Each offers from nine to thirty- one rooms. The Cedar Building is the only one to contain larger \\"family rooms\\". The buildings are named after species of flowers or trees. The Lodge is the less expensive of the two options in the Yosemite Valley that offer hotel rooms. The other is Ahwahnee Hotel. Both of these are operated by concessionaires under contract to the National Park Service, which administers the Park. Since March 2016, the Lodge has been operated by Aramark. The offerings of the Lodge complex were reduced by more than half following damage from the 100-year flood of January 1997, when the Merced River damaged or destroyed numerous cabins and more than 100 hotel rooms in other buildings. History The Lodge complex was built during the 1930s and the Great Depression, as a Works Progress Administration project under the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Originally operated by staff of the National Park Service, which has primary responsibility for administering the Park, the Lodge services were later contracted out to private concessionaires. In 1992 Delaware North Parks and Resorts made the winning bid for primary concessions and was awarded management of Yosemite Lodge by the National Park Service, the federal agency with legislative authority for administering the Park. In January 1997, during a 100-year flood of the nearby Merced River, some 189 cabins and 108 hotel rooms of the Lodge were destroyed or badly damaged as a result. The Lodge complex lost 54% of its total capacity of 546 rooms by this. The 1997 Merced River Flood Delaware North was replaced as concessionaire by Aramark, on March 1, 2016. During a copyright dispute between Delaware North and the National Park Service later that year, NPS renamed Yosemite Lodge at the Falls as Yosemite Valley Lodge, along with several related properties., National Park Service Yosemite National Park to change landmarks' names, CNN]. Retrieved January 17, 2015. After settlement of the dispute in 2019, NPS restored the historical names of the Lodge and other attractions in the Park.

He is recognized as a visionary in library information.More on the 'Rocket eBook' Library Administrator's Digest, Nov 1998 by Robinson, Charles W.  Biography  He was born in 1938 in London a few weeks after his parents arrived as immigrants. His father was a Hungarian Jew and a Baron, his mother from Spanish nobility. B√©la spent his childhood in England. He received a scholarship to attend University of St Andrews from BP. In 1956 he began his career as a customer service engineer, a computer programmer and a salesman. In 1965, he moved to the United States to get an MBA at Harvard University. He founded his first company, COMSISA, in Mexico City, in 1968 which computerised and served sugar mills and local businesses. In 1971, in partnership with Dennis Beaumont, Computer Library Services (CLSI) was started in Boston. This was the first company to develop the minicomputer for use in libraries, in effect building the Online Public Access Computer (OPAC) market. After returning to live in London in 1981, Hatvany sold it to Thyssen Bornemisza in 1983. In 1980, with Henry Ng, he invented the touch screen which is now used on smartphones and tablets. Bela explains in this video interview that the idea of how to design a touch screen originally came to him whilst trying to solve a problem on a project that the dean of the department assigned to him whilst Bela was an electrical engineering student at St Andrew's University. In 1982, he started a small organization called \\"INCubator\\" based in Chiswick, West London. This later became SilverPlatter Information. The company published the first CD-ROMs in 1982 and thrived, developing a number of innovative products including networked CD-ROM, client-server delivery for bibliographic databases. Silver Platter Information was one of the first companies to deliver databases on the internet. In 2001 it was sold to Wolters-Kluwer. From 2001 to 2017 B√©la was quite active as an angel investor in early-stage companies in the UK and the US with particular emphasis on entities that made strong positive social contributions. These include: JustGiving, Credo Reference, MediaSilo, Classical, Harmonix, LuvliFoods and CoreWeb. Bela elucidates six points here about starting your own business or investing in another business. In 2001 Hatvany became the key investor and a Board Member of JustGiving in London where he mentored the founders Zarine Kharas and Anne Marie Huby. They worked together to create an organisation in which all constituents experience themselves to be well-served. JustGiving pioneered on-line giving and became the world's leading online fundraising platform enabling individuals to raise over ¬£2Bn for charities. It was sold to Blackbaud Inc in October 2017. Hatvany served on the board of a number of other companies which he encouraged to embrace the philosophy of serving all their constituents in a balanced way. His extensive business experience helped the companies refine their vision to emphasize the importance of (right) corporate culture and focus on excellent user experience. Mustardseed Trust is a UK-registered charity founded in 2001 by B√©la Hatvany, Ellen Hatvany and Lauren Hatvany. Mustardseed enables organizations and individuals with a clear and compelling vision to create systems based on partnership that care for the web of life. Mustardseed's three focus areas are: 1.Culture Shift from domination to partnership 2.The CAREconomy: economic models that value care and promote the principles of partnership 3.Ecosystem preservation and restoration through partnership with the earth's systems. From 2009 to 2012 Mustardseed initiated AkiliMali to help entrepreneurs in East Africa. This emphasized the creation of local business advisors to mentor fledgeling businesses. In 2013 B√©la commissioned a short film called 'Change' through producer Kelly Burks and Initiatives of Change, UK. The core message of the film was the importance of shifting the focus of business from short term profit to long term sustainable profitability. Narrated by Jeremy Irons, the film was a 'fire starter' and premiered at the TIGE Conference (Trust and Integrity in the Global Economy) in Caux, Switzerland in July, 2013. Later in 2013, the film became the calling card for ‚ÄòThe B√©la Initiative‚Äô which Hatvany announced as an alliance in which organizations, individuals, businesses and entrepreneurs could join to collaborate, share information and experience. The B√©la Initiative's purpose is to give and to receive in ways that empower oneself or others to develop a clear purpose to serve the whole ‚Äì in short, to enable a world that works for everyone. In December 2013 Hatvany collaborated with Lawrence Bloom, Chairman of Be Energy, Kelly Burks and Initiatives of Change, UK to launch the first meeting of 'The Change Enquiry' which was the natural progression from 'The B√©la Initiative'. The enquiry focused on how to shift from combative, competitive, dominating, patriarchal culture to a culture of harmonization, collaboration, and listening for what connects us. The conference was held at Initiatives of Change HQ in London. The initial conference was followed by two further conferences in 2014 at Initiatives of Change with the attendees self- forming into a number of teams: Communication, Enterprise, Technology, Collaboration, Consciousness, Governance and Team Building while self- distilling down to the key advocates for the enquiry. The teams examined the necessity of a shift in worldview, values and awareness at a personal and collective level: * Engage everyone in an enquiry that enables a world which works for all beings in a balanced way. * Centre the enquiry on how we can change our behaviour from combative/competitive to collaborative/harmonizing * Humanity should emulate nature ‚Äì in a healthy ecology all things thrive ‚Äì not one or two with the remainder diminishing. * Create a new economy which eradicates the fear that surrounds money. * Replace TV and newspapers with modern IT and media systems that invite our involvement and enable us to influence the systems which govern us. * Trustbuilding is the most effective and least expensive form of security today. CE members from the collaboration team met in Epping Forest to spend the day in honest conversation looking at the value of collaboration on a personal level and created a short film, Collaboration Day. Discussions in the enquiry ranged over the use of the web and the communications team developed a concept to create a ‚ÄòShare Yourself‚Äô app where people worldwide could see a wall of faces of people from around the globe and click on any of them to hear them answer 3 questions; I am, I fear, I love - and be able to record their own responses to these questions. Communications team members attended the TIGE Conference see page 23 in Caux, Switzerland in July 2014 to film volunteers providing an unexpectedly powerful insight into the lives of people around the world. From 2014 to 2017 B√©la took the learning gained from the Change Enquiry and expanded his vision for enabling a world that works for everyone through the development of his concept for The Care Economy. He met and liaised with a number of leading individuals calling for an economic revolution including Bernard Lietaer, Kate Raworth, Riane Eisler, Enno Schmidt], http://stephanie-ristig.de/wer-bin-ich/ Stefanie Ristig-Bresser], Christian Felber, Guy Standing and others. Hatvany was invited to the TIGE Conference at Caux in 2014 where he spoke and shared his 'Sketch for a new economy which works for everyone.' B√©la convened 'Economy for the Common Good - The Care Economy Enquiry' at Caux in July 2016 alongside the TIGE Conference. B√©la, Stefanie Ristig-Bresser, a pioneer from the Economy for the Common Good, UBI filmmaker, Enno Schmidt, and others guided this enquiry. B√©la and Ellen Hatvany In 2016 Hatvany met Stefanie Overbeck, creator of the Polymoney Game. This meeting was instigated by Bernard Lietaer, who had used Polymoney in his teaching syllabus since 2012. Stefanie meeting B√©la resulted in a collaboration between Mustardseed and Polymoney; the Polymoney Summit Caux in July 2017. Fifteen activists and practitioners in complementary and alternative currencies from different parts of the world shared their experiences and started to work together. They requested a follow-on conference. Hatvany named the broader vision to enable an economy which cares for humanity and our planet - theCAREconomy. B√©la and Lauren Hatvany, through the Mustardseed Trust, sponsored Overbeck and the team she formed to realise the first theCAREconomy Meet-up (1st) at Caux, Switzerland in June, 2018.

Manchin served as the West Virginia Secretary of Education and the Arts from 2017 until her termination in March 2018. She is the wife of former Governor and current U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Early life and education Gayle Manchin was raised in Beckley, West Virginia and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. She received both her Bachelor of Arts in language arts and education, and a Master of Arts in reading (now known as the masters in literacy education), from West Virginia University. In 1999, she received a second master's degree in educational technology leadership from Salem International University. In 1967, Gayle Conelly married Manchin, with whom she had three children, Heather, Joseph IV, and Brooke, and settled in Fairmont, West Virginia. Career Manchin is a career educator. She has worked as a teacher in the Marion County Public School district and a faculty member at Fairmont State University, where she established the university's inaugural Community Service Learning Program. She has also served as Director of the AmeriCorps Promise Fellow Program in West Virginia. Additionally, Machin worked for the Office of Secretary of Education and the Arts, where she established the West Virginia Partnerships to Assure Student Success initiative (WV PASS). Gayle Manchin held the position of First Lady of West Virginia from 2005 until 2010 during her husband's term as the state's governor. During her tenure as First Lady, Manchin simultaneously served as the chairperson of the West Virginia Citizen‚Äôs Council on Children and Families and Governor‚Äôs Healthy Lifestyles Coalition, co-chair of the Governor‚Äôs 21st Century Jobs Cabinet and the Intellectual Infrastructure of Vision Shared, and a member of the West Virginia Commission for National and Community Service. In 2007, Manchin was appointed to the West Virginia Board of Education from 2007 to 2015. She served two terms as the Board of Education's vice president. On July 10, 2013, Manchin was elected President of the West Virginia Board of Education for a two-year term. In 2016, Manchin was the subject of some controversy when USA Today, a national newspaper, published an article noting that Manchin, upon becoming Board of Education president in 2012, spearheaded a campaign for states to require schools to purchase EpiPens and other medical supplies. Eleven states created laws to require schools to stock EpiPens, made by Mylan pharmaceuticals, leading to a \\"near monopoly\\" of Mylan's epinephrine autoinjector in the school health sector. The article noted the potential for a conflict of interest, as Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, is Manchin's daughter. West Virginia Secretary of Education and the Arts Incoming Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice appointed Manchin to his cabinet as the state's Secretary of Education and the Arts on January 13, 2017. Manchin succeeded outgoing Secretary of Education Kay Goodwin, who was retiring from the office. The Secretary for Education and the Arts oversees a collection of six state agencies, including West Virginia Public Broadcasting, the West Virginia Library Commission, the Division of Culture and History, Volunteer West Virginia, the state Center for Professional Development, and the Division of Rehabilitation Services. After the passage of HB 4006, a bill that would dissolve the West Virginia Department of Education and the Arts, in the West Virginia Legislature, Manchin called on Justice to veto the legislation. Manchin also offered to resign and \\"remove any political cloud,\\" though days later, she was removed from office by Justice, leaving the office of Department Secretary vacant.

The term was first used by Jagdish Bhagwati in 1995 in the paper: ‚ÄúUS Trade policy: The infatuation with free trade agreements‚Äù, where he openly criticized FTAs as being paradoxically counter-productive in promoting freer and more opened global trades. According to Bhagwati, too many crisscrossing FTAs would allow countries to adopt discriminatory trade policies and reduce the economic benefits of trade.  Context  In 1947, the most economically prominent nations signed the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), whose main goals were to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers as well as eliminate discriminatory treatments between signatory countries. After gradual rounds of negotiations, more countries were integrated and tariffs were significantly reduced. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995 to meet the growing institutional needs of a deepening globalization. However, because of the increasing number of members and interest diversity, as well as the complication of the topics discussed (subsidies, intellectual property, etc.), liberalization negotiations have slowed down since the 1990s. The last WTO Negotiation Round, the Doha Round, launched in 2001, stalled over disagreements on agricultural subsidies and market access, as well as intellectual property issues. In this way, many countries have been resorting to bilateral and multilateral FTAs as a faster and more flexible way to promote free trades and globalization. Indeed, FTAs require only the consent of a limited number of like-minded countries, as opposed to the general consent of all WTO members necessary to conclude a negotiation round. Such agreements also allow countries to tackle broader issues such as bilateral investments, labor migration and regulations. As a result, the numbers of FTAs in force and in negotiations have exploded since the mid-1990s, passing from 100 agreements in 1990 to more than 400 in 2008.  Challenges posed by FTAs according to J. Bhagwati  This FTA trend has been described by many economists as a more pragmatic way to promote free trade and globalization. Jagdish Bhagwati strongly opposes this opinion, describing the entanglement of hundreds of FTAs with various rules, tariffs and institutional arrangements as a ‚Äúspaghetti bowl‚Äù. Bhagwati identifies several problems inherent to FTAs, which make them unfit to promote a clear and global trade liberalization with widespread benefits: * A founding principle of the GATT, and later the WTO, is the non-discriminatory principle or ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation Clause‚Äù (MFN), stating that GATT country-members cannot discriminate between their trade partners. In this way, any special favor should be granted to all trade partners without distinction. FTAs would constitute a loophole in the MFN clause, enabling states to enforce different level of tariffs and trade barriers. * Rules of Origins (RoO) define traded goods‚Äô eligibility for FTAs‚Äô preferential tariffs regimes. Every FTA sets its own geographical conditions of production for concerned goods. Because of globalization and the development of international supply chains, rules of origins fail to reflect goods‚Äô complex international origins and are often impossible to enforce. * FTAs are associated with high costs for both governments and firms. To enjoy FTAs‚Äô preferential tariffs, firms need to undergo complex administrative tasks, prove goods‚Äô origins and adapt to FTAs‚Äô many regulations. Thus, FTAs would entail high administrative fixed costs for firms, precluding smaller firms to fully enjoy preferential tariffs, and depleting member-countries‚Äô overall competitiveness. * While multilateral trade liberalization increases World trades level, FTAs can sometimes be trade-diverting. Bilateral trades surge between two FTAs signatories, however trades with tier-countries are likely to fall. Thus, FTAs lead to both trade creation and diversion. * Bhagwati, also deplores the lack of political and economic equality characterizing FTA relations. In general, FTAs would be signed between an important economic power, such as the United States or the European Union, with smaller and less powerful countries. The bigger state can use its larger market as a leverage to introduce non-trade related measures concerning regulations, migration, labor standards or the environment. At the opposite, multilateral negotiations would allow for a more equal liberalization since every country can defend its own interests. * Freer trades are a useful tool for least developed countries to obtain more capital, new technologies and better business practices. However, those countries often offer fewer market and investment opportunities, thus more developed countries will choose to direct their negotiations capacities toward richer regions. In 2017, the European Union had 5 FTAs with Sub-Saharan countries out of a total of 43 FTAs in place. As developed countries effectively lower trade barriers and tariffs between them, countries at the margin are faced with higher tariffs which are hurtful for their development. Several empirical studies have been led to determine the Spaghetti Bowl Effect‚Äôs true cost on countries‚Äô trade volumes and competitiveness. Japanese Researchers from Keio University, observed 132 countries and established that, even though trade volumes were positively correlated with FTAs, this effect was characterized by diminishing returns.F. Kimura, A. Kuno, K. Hayakawa. ‚ÄúDoes the number of RTAs matter?‚Äù, Keio University, 2006. [Online], Available at: https://faculty.washington.edu/karyiu/confer/GJ06/papers/kimura-kuno- hayakawa.pdf In this way, the increasingly heavy and costly administrative burden caused by the multiplication of FTAs would deter firms to use FTA‚Äôs preferential tariffs, thus proving a Spaghetti Bowl Effect. Noodle Bowl Effect Asian countries have seen a dramatic rise in FTAs since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2000, only 3 FTAs were in force, nine years later, 37 FTAs were in force and 72 under negotiations. Important hubs, such as the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Japan and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) emerged. The growing de facto economic integration combined with a lack of common economic institutions has led Asian countries to adopt pro-FTAs trade policies. As a result, both firms and governments, started to worry about the burden imposed by the Asian trade environment‚Äôs growing complication. This phenomenon was nicknamed \\"The Noodle Bowl Effect\\" by several newspapers and academics to highlight its endemic Asian nature. In a 2009 survey,M. Kawai, G. Wignaraja. ‚ÄúThe Asian Noodle Bowl: Is it serious for business?‚Äù, Working paper serie, Asian Development Bank, 2009. [Online], available at: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/155991/adbi- wp136.pdf only 20.8% of South Korean firms, 29% of Japanese firms and 45.1% of Chinese firms effectively used FTAs . 20% of the surveyed firms across Asia considered multiples rules of origins as costly for their businesses. Smaller firms were also more deterred from using FTAs‚Äô preferential tariffs because of the high and complex administrative burden.

This was Anderson's first travel outside of New Zealand which at that time had a population of just over 2 million.[1960 in New Zealand] The first tours Arriving in England in 1962, Anderson set about planning a trip to see Europe however had only ¬£25 to his name Anderson came up with the idea of advertising for 11 other young Australasians to join him on the trip. He worked out the total costs for the trip and then divided by 11, thus providing a free seat for himself. The trip sold quickly, assisted by Anderson meeting prospective fellow travellers and exaggerating his experience of Europe. In fact, his only previous experience of Europe was an overnight trip to Paris. Shortly after having sold all the seats, Anderson was approached by two more prospective passengers. Anderson decided to take advantage of the interest and advertise a second tour to operate following the first. This second tour also sold well and sold out before the first tour departed.Unlimited Magazine Despite Anderson's inexperience the tour was a success. Anderson admitted his lack of European knowledge to his customers on the first day. After that, he and the eleven others shared duties and decision making, including driving duties in the 12 seater Commer van they christened Tiki after the Maori good luck charm For the second tour Anderson had increased the price from ¬£100 to ¬£115 per person. Despite this, upon arrival in Monaco Anderson found he had nearly run out of money and would be unable to complete the advertised itinerary. Anderson worked out the amount of money that he would need to express the group directly back to England and took the remaining funds to a casino where he gambled on the roulette tables. He won and was able to continue the tour without his customers finding out. Contiki Holidays The trips which had begun as an exercise to fund his own travels around Europe became a fast- growing business; fleet and staff grew rapidly and a number of new tours were developed under the name Tiki Tours, in recognition of the company's first vehicle. When the New Zealand Tourist Board challenged Anderson over his use of the name Tiki Tours he changed the company's name to Contiki, the con coming from The Continent.Sydney Morning Herald Contiki grew to include tours worldwide. During the 1980s the company began to diversify from its roots as a tour company for 18- to 35-year-olds (originally 19 to 29). Examples included building hotel resorts in Queenstown and in the Great Barrier Reef, and the purchase of Fullers Ferries. By the mid 1980s Contiki was a global organisation headquartered in Hong Kong. Anderson was living in New Zealand and travelled frequently for directors meetings and to review the company's operations. Sale of Contiki In the early 1980s Anderson sold down his investment in Contiki, allowing fellow directors to invest as shareholders. In 1985 Omnicorp, a company controlled by Lloyd Morrison purchased a 50% stake in the business. The stock market crash of 1987 devalued many of Contiki's assets. This, along with the poor performance of recent acquisitions, notably Fullers Ferries, placed Anderson in financial difficulty. In 1989 he was forced to sell his remaining shares in Contiki as well as his family home to avoid bankruptcy. After Contiki During the early 1990s Anderson was employed to sell off the assets of former Contiki empire. His wife Ali returned to full-time work to supplement their income. They briefly owned and ran a chain of storesGlobal Sandwich review in Auckland selling packaged sandwiches. The business was short-lived and they moved to Blenheim in the late 1990s. Along with Contours Travel, John has started tours to South America for 'baby boomers'.Speaker Profile of John Anderson at The Celebrity Speakers Bureau Public speaking In recent years Anderson has taken up public speaking as a profession and has presented his Contiki story to many businesses. Only Two Seats Left In 2010 Anderson published Only Two Seats Left, an autobiography that focuses mainly on his time with Contiki from 1961 to 1989.

The Big Short, W. W. Norton, 2010. In addition, James Mai‚Äôs investment strategy was portrayed by Jack D. Schwager in the book Hedge Fund Market Wizards (2012), an inside analysis of the world's greatest hedge fund experts and the strategies that they implement. They were featured in the film adaptation of The Big Short, fictionalized with the names Charlie Geller, Jamie Shipley and Ben Rickert (played by John Magaro, Finn Wittrock and Brad Pitt). This has resulted in them being widely known for their investments running up to the financial crash in 2007-8. History The firm started as a family office to diversify the capital of James Mai‚Äôs father. Soon after Cornwall's inception, Charlie Ledley, a former private equity colleague, joined the firm. In 2005, Ben Hockett joined as head trader, bringing extensive knowledge of capital markets, derivatives, and fixed income trading. Charlie Ledley left Cornwall in 2009 to join a large Boston-based hedge fund. Ben Hockett has remained at the firm as the head trader and chief risk officer. Other senior members include partners JC de Swaan and Ian Haft. Cornwall seeks highly asymmetric investments, in which the upside potential significantly exceeds the downside risk, across a broad spectrum of strategies ranging from trades that seek to benefit from market inefficiencies to thematic fundamental trades. The firm has produced an average annual compounded net return of 40 percent (52 percent gross). Cornwall Capital was one of a few investors who saw and shorted the subprime mortgage crisis market prior to the 2007 collapse; according to Michael Lewis, they were perhaps one out of 20 in the world who did so. Transcript of interview with Michael Lewis, included in the Audio version of The Big Short. This particular trade generated 80 times the initial premium (investment). The founders of Cornwall Capital started a hedge fund in their garage with $110,000 and built it into $120 million when the market crashed. Cornwall Capital was reported to have become in 2013 the largest shareholder of American Pacific Corporation, a NASDAQ listed US company, with close to 15% of the outstanding stock. American Pacific Corporation agreed to nominate Ian Haft for election to its board of directors in order to resolve a potential proxy contest. The company was sold to H.I.G. Capital in January 2014. James Mai decided to open up the fund to a few like-minded investors with whom he could be transparent and share ideas, starting in May 2011.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. During his career he was credited with between 70 and 96 aerial victories. Biography Lemke was born on 7 April 1921 in Schivelbein, Farther Pomerania (today ≈öwidwin, Poland). In the autumn of 1942, Unteroffizier Lemke was posted to the first squadron (staffel) of Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG2), based on the French coast. His was to remain with JG2 throughout the rest of the war. His first victory came on 12 March 1943 when he downed an RAF Spitfire fighter near F√©camp. He was promoted to Staffelf√ºhrer of his squadron on 12 September 1943. In late January 1944, his squadron was transferred to the south of France to counter the bombing raids of the 15th Air Force, USAAF. On 9 February 1944 Lemke shot down four Spitfires southeast of Cannes - one of which was flown by American pilot Bob Hoover - to move his tally to 19 victories. His squadron were again transferred to Italy to counter the Allied landings at Anzio. In March, 1944 Lemke added sixteen further victories to his tally. By the early summer of 1944, Lemke's squadron was again moved, this time to Creil, an airfield north of Paris. From here Lemke flew combat missions over the developing campaign in Normandy following D-Day. On 14 June 1944 Leutnant Lemke was awarded the Ritterkreuz for his then tally of 47 victories and shortly after on 23 June he was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of the third squadron (staffel) of JG2 (he replaced Josef Wurmheller who had been killed the previous day). Lemke was to lead this squadron until the end of the war. Lemke flew a total of 325 combat missions and ultimately reached 70 victories, including 25 Spitfires, eight P-47 Thunderbolts, six P-51 Mustangs and at least five four-engine bombers (B-17s).

It opened in May 1997 to transport tourists to the adit entrance of the Quincy Mine's Number 5 shaft. Its tram car has a capacity of 28 people and travels at a maximum grade of 35%. It is one of only a few rack railways in the United States. History Mining era Prior to the creation of the current tourist tramway, there existed a tramway used by the Quincy Mine to transport ore down the hill to the Quincy Smelter. It consisted of two tracks with tramcars in counterbalance. It was long with a vertical drop. Modern era Before the current tram was added, tourists were transported to the adit entrance by van, an indirect and cumbersome method. The solution of a tram was suggested by the vice president of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association, James R. Vivian Sr. The U.S. Economic Development Administration provided $420,000 in funds with a matching $200,000 raised by the Hoist Association. Construction began on April 12, 1996, and was completed on November 11, 1996. The tramway opened for use in May 1997. The tramcar, designed by Phil Quenzi, was built by Royale Construction Inc. of Kearsarge, Michigan and the grading and tracking laying was carried out by MJO Construction of Hancock, Michigan. The project engineer was Robert D. Hitch, P.E. and the project manager was James R. Vivian Jr. In the winter of 2009, the tram underwent a refurbishment, including new paint, new windows, and refurbished seats. Details The diesel tramcar is long, and wide.

Early career Stewart was born in Scotland but emigrated to British America. He became a successful merchant in the port town of Norfolk, Virginia. He came to official notice during the Seven Years' War, when in 1762 a ship carrying Spanish prisoners of war ran aground near Norfolk. An angry mob set upon the Spaniards, killing two before Stewart intervened to save the lives of the rest. This impressed the authorities, who rewarded him with a post in the customs service. He had risen to be Paymaster General of the American Customs Board by the time he sailed for Britain in 1769.Blumrosen p.1-2 Somerset Case In 1749 Stewart had purchased James Somerset a young slave boy recent enslaved in West Africa and brought across the Atlantic Ocean. Somerset learned English very quickly. Stewart dressed Somerset in more expensive clothes than his other slaves and took him to important business meetings. Stewart took Somerset with him when he went to Britain to help support his sister Cecilia, whose husband had recently died, and her family.Blumrosen p.1-5 Once in Britain, while working on business for Stewart, Somerset came into contact with a number of free blacks and white abolitionists. Motivated by a desire to secure his freedom, Somerset ran away from Stewart's home in October 1771. Stewart was angered and put up notices about his loss. After Somerset was recaptured in November 1771 he was gaoled aboard the Ann and Mary, which was about to sail for the West Indies where he was to be sold on. Before the ship departed, his abolitionist godparents challenged his detention on the grounds of habeas corpus. The Chief Justice Lord Mansfield temporarily released Somerset while the two sides prepared their cases. Somerset's cause was taken up by Granville Sharp, a leading abolitionist.Blumrosen p.5-8 Mansfield tried to persuade Stewart to free Somerset, as had happened in several similar recent incidents, thereby avoiding a potentially controversial legal case that might challenge the entire legality of slavery. Stewart refused, and his case was financed by planters in the West Indies who wanted to force a ruling that they believed would confirm that slavery was legal. Although Mansfield indicated to them that he was likely to rule against them, they refused to back down. As a last resort Mansfield tried to persuade Somerset's godmother to buy him from Stewart and set him free, but she declined on principle.Hochschild p.48-49Blumrosen p.9-10 In his final ruling, Mansfield ordered that Somerset be discharged and concluded with an attack on the institution of slavery. Although he subsequently insisted his ruling had not entirely outlawed slavery in England, it was widely taken as such. See also *United States labor law References Bibliography * Hochschild, Adam.

Like the previous seasons, it focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and her staff at the parks and recreation department of the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. The season featured 16 episodes, most of which were approximately 22 minutes long each and aired at 9:30 p.m. on Thursdays. The season stars Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, and Rob Lowe, with supporting performances from Jim O'Heir and Retta. All of the members of the original cast returned for the third season except Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Rob Lowe and Adam Scott, who appeared as guest stars in the second season, began season three as regular cast members playing Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt, respectively. The season also featured guest appearances by Megan Mullally, Will Forte and Parker Posey, among others. To accommodate Amy Poehler's pregnancy, the first six episodes of the third season were filmed immediately after season two wrapped so they could be saved for a projected September 2010 air date. However, after the episodes were finished, NBC postponed the season premiere until January to accommodate their new series, Outsourced. The third season consisted of several major story arcs, including a complete shutdown of the Pawnee government for budgetary reasons, inspired by the real-life global financial crisis. Other storylines included the parks department's organization of a harvest festival, a romance between Leslie and Ben, and the dating and eventual marriage of Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza). As in the previous season, Parks and Recreation was critically acclaimed during its third season, and was declared by several reviewers to be one of the best comedies on television. Entertainment Weekly featured it on its cover in February 2011 and declared it \\"the smartest comedy on TV\\". The episodes \\"Harvest Festival\\" and \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" received particularly positive reviews, as did Nick Offerman in his role as parks director Ron Swanson. Parks and Recreation received its first nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for its third season, and Poehler received her second nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Nevertheless, Parks and Recreation continued to struggle in the Nielsen ratings and averaged about 4.75 million household viewers per week.

Production Cast Almost the entire original cast from season two returned for the third season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series at the end of season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although they still do not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded. Nick Offerman's wife Megan Mullally, who previously played Ron Swanson's ex-wife Tammy in the episode \\"Ron and Tammy\\", reprised that role in \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\", and briefly appeared as the character in the season finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\". Will Forte, a comedian who previously starred on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live along with Amy Poehler, guest-starred in \\"Time Capsule\\" as a Pawnee resident demanding the Twilight books be added to the town's time capsule. Parker Posey, who previously starred with Poehler in the 2009 comedy film Spring Breakdown, appeared in \\"Eagleton\\" as Leslie's former best friend and rival official from a neighboring town. Posey had been in discussions with the Parks and Recreation staff to make a guest appearance since the show debuted, and grew frustrated when it took several months before she received an invitation. Ben Schwartz continued to appear in the third season as Tom Haverford's cocky friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein. Several actors who had appeared in previous seasons of Parks and Recreation continue to appear in the third season, including Ben Schwartz as Tom's cocky and entrepreneurial friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein; Natalie Morales as bartender and Tom's girlfriend Lucy; Jama Williamson as Wendy, Tom's ex-wife who starts dating Ron; Pamela Reed as Leslie's mother Marlene Griggs-Knope; Alison Becker as newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep; Darlene Hunt as conservative activist Marcia Langman; Mo Collins as morning talk show host Joan Callamezzo; Jay Jackson as television newscaster Perd Hapley; Andy Forrest as Andy's frequent shoeshine customer Kyle, and Kirk Fox as sleazy sewage department employee Joe. Eric Pierpoint appeared in \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\" and \\"Eagleton\\" as Hugh Trumple, chief of the Pawnee police department. Comedians Matt Besser and Nick Kroll appeared in \\"Media Blitz\\" as \\"Crazy Ira and The Douche\\", the hosts of a Pawnee morning zoo-style radio show. Besser had previously been on the sketch comedy show and troupe Upright Citizens Brigade with Poehler. Detlef Schrempf, a retired Indiana Pacers basketball player who played himself in the second-season episode \\"Telethon\\", appeared again in \\"Li'l Sebastian\\". Jonathan Joss, who previously voiced John Redcorn in the animated television series King of the Hill ‚Äî which was co-created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels ‚Äî guest starred in \\"Harvest Festival\\" as the local Native American tribe leader. Filming The first six episodes of the third season were filmed early to accommodate the pregnancy of Amy Poehler (pictured). Toward the end of production on the second season, lead actor Amy Poehler became pregnant and the producers of the show were forced to go into production on season three early and film an additional six episodes to accommodate not only Poehler's pregnancy, but also a projected September 2010 air date. Amy Poehler said the cast was \\"a little fried\\" by the intense shooting schedule, but that the addition of Adam Scott and Rob Lowe to the cast provided an energy boost. Since Poehler was six months pregnant at the time of filming the first six episodes, she was often strategically placed behind items to conceal her belly. Although the third episode to be shown, \\"Time Capsule\\" was the last of these six episodes to be filmed because the story presented the highest amount of props to place Poehler in front of objects to hide her pregnancy, most notably the time capsule itself. However, NBC eventually opted not to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season until the beginning of 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: \\"It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could.\\" Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, \\"It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice.\\" Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material. As in previous seasons, filming of the third season of the series included a large amount of improvisation from the cast. For example, during one scene in \\"The Fight\\" in which almost the entire cast becomes intoxicated at the Snakehole Lounge bar, each actor spent about two days on their own filming their own individual scenes. Much of the filming was improvised, including shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become by the end of the night. Amy Poehler described the filming as \\"the most fun I've ever had\\". Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally also improvised a great deal of their scenes during the filming of \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\". The third season continued to use several visual and camera techniques that had been introduced in past seasons. In the past, Poehler would improvise several different jokes during a take, and they would be intermingled into a montage of jump cuts featuring many of the jokes. That technique was used prominently in \\"Indianapolis\\" during a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann with stories about multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past. The same technique was used by Aziz Ansari in \\"Soulmates\\", during a scene in which Tom describes many slang nicknames he has given to foods, and in \\"The Fight\\", in which Tom describes many strange entrepreneurial idea he has come up with. The \\"Harvest Festival\\" episode featured an elaborate festival setting and corn maze sets. Due to budget restraints, the Parks and Recreation set department did not build the set, but instead used a real-life setting at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college in California which holds an annual festival event. Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival at the end of the episode was the most expensive shot in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, \\"the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now\\". The Eagleton public forum scene in the episode \\"Eagleton\\" was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in the Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles. The season finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" saw the introduction of the headquarters for Tom and Jean-Ralphio's new company, Entertainment 720. The setting was a completely white room with modern decor and unusual furniture, and Michael Schur described the setting as, \\"Maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series ... It's truly nuts. It's like a hallucinogenic nightmare.\\" After the original broadcast of \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\", NBC ran a commercial advertising \\"April and Andy's wedding registry\\" on the official Parks and Recreation website. At this point in the season, April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled. Shortly after the episode aired, HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy's wedding registry. However, after \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" aired, Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode, but ran with \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\" due to an error by NBC employees: Schur said afterward, \\"We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could.\\" Writing The financial difficulties Pawnee experiences during the third season were reflective of the financial crisis facing the nation and much of the world when the episodes were produced. The idea of state auditors visiting Pawnee, and the subsequent government shutdown, were inspired by news reports at the time of a number of states that were considering a shut down of schools, parks and other services due to the global recession. Amy Poehler described one of the early themes of the season as Leslie Knope trying to maintain her optimism about public service in the face of economic cutbacks and cynicism about government: \\"How does one person work in government and not become cynical? How does someone believe that change could happen without losing faith?\\" Much of the first seven episodes of the season revolved around the characters organizing a harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee and the major cuts threatened to the parks department, which prompts Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success and failure. The festival served as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, similar to efforts to turn a construction pit into a park during the first two seasons. Schur said the harvest festival story arc was written in part because the first six episodes were written and filmed early, so the writing staff felt having one concise storyline to tie them together kept the show focused. Schur also said the writers were fatigued from working on six third-season episodes immediately after the second season, so the harvest festival story arc helped \\"organize our tired, end-of-the-year brains\\". One of the biggest story arcs of the third season was the romance between Leslie and Ben, which slowly developed throughout the series until they officially began dating in the episode \\"Road Trip\\" despite a strict policy against workplace dating at city hall. The development of Ben's feelings for Leslie coincide with his growing appreciation for Pawnee; the character never had a firm sense of home due to the excessive amount of traveling with his job, but throughout the season Ben gradually falls in love with the town due to the optimism and enthusiasm Leslie Knope shows for Pawnee and her job. The no-dating policy, imposed by Chris, stemmed from real life policies in small town governments, which Schur said were considered very important because \\"these people are handling taxpayer money, so relationships are even more frowned upon than they are in the private sector\\". During the season finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\", Leslie is encouraged by political operatives to run for office, but is asked whether there any potential scandals that could risk becoming public. Leslie denies there are any, but it is suggested her secret relationship with Ben could become such a scandal. The first five episodes of the season involve Andy and his attempt to win back the affections of April, who previously had feelings for Andy, but became angry after Ann kissed him in the second-season finale, \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\". The two reconcile in \\"Media Blitz\\", which Schur described as a \\"key moment\\" in their relationship, \\"almost like Andy's a Knight of the Round Table, and he's got a lot of different obstacles that he's got to overcome in order to win the love of a fair maiden\\". Andy and April become married during a surprise wedding four episodes later in \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\". Schur said the decision to have them marry after only briefly dating stemmed from the writing staff's desire to \\"avoid the standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on\\". They decided a fast marriage was funny, but also made sense because the characters are \\"two impulsive goofballs who don‚Äôt approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner\\". Michael Schur said another goal of the third season was to better demonstrate the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones, whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters. This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger, who is so overly-optimistic and seemingly- perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him. Schur said: \\"Rashida is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you.\\" Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in \\"Indianapolis\\" that Chris broke up with her, but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days. Afterward, Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men. During the final episodes of the season, Ann takes a part-time job at city hall as the health department public relations director, which Schur described as \\"the natural full circle from the beginning of the season\\". This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a \\"more mature person\\". Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters. The character Tom Haverford also undergoes changes during the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in \\"The Bubble\\", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, and the arrival of Ron's first ex- wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to \\"write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it\\". Reception Broadcast While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, the third season marked its debut in a 9:30 p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011, airing between the two popular series The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, \\"'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor.\\" The Parks producers hoped the Office lead-in would bring new viewers, and so the season premiere \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" included an introductory sequence that described the previous events of the series. In some cases, \\"Producer's Cut\\" versions of third-season episodes were made available on the official NBC website after they were broadcast. These cuts were about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations. The episodes to receive \\"Producer's Cuts\\" included \\"Harvest Festival\\", \\"The Fight\\" and \\"Li'l Sebastian\\". During its original broadcast, the episode \\"Jerry's Painting\\" ran for an extended 40 minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes because it followed \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", an extended episode of The Office that featured the final appearance of Steve Carell as a regular cast member. \\"The Fight\\" and \\"Road Trip\\" ran back-to-back during their original broadcast on May 12, 2011, as did \\"The Bubble\\" and \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" on May 19. The four were stand-alone episodes that were not originally designed to be shown together, However, because the third season premiered late as a mid-season replacement in January, the episodes aired together so the series' season would conclude at the end of the television season. Reviews Parks and Recreation continued to receive critical acclaim, as it did during the second season. The show was featured on the February 11 cover of Entertainment Weekly, where it was called \\"the smartest comedy on TV\\" and which included the article \\"The 101 Reasons We Love Parks and Recreation\\". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it \\"a fabulous season ‚Äì the best thing on TV in 2011 so far\\". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad called it one of the ten best shows of 2011, and said the season saw major growth of both its major characters, especially Leslie Knope, along with the expansion of a strong cast of secondary and tertiary characters as well. New York magazine writer Willa Paskin praised the show for comedy grounded in optimism and characters who genuinely like each other, rather than the cynical humor more prevalent in other comedy shows of the time. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it a \\"remarkable season of TV comedy\\" without a single bad episode. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said although he considered Parks and Recreation the funniest sitcom on television during its second season, \\"it somehow got even better\\" during the third. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said during the third season, Parks and Recreation was \\"the funniest, sweetest, most consistent sitcom on television\\", and that the way the characters were seeking new opportunities outside the parks department by the end of the season demonstrates the show is willing to change and is \\"not content to simply spin its wheels\\". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said he believed that the third season \\"will become to be recognized as one of the best seasons of any sitcom ever\\", and that the characters and setting of Pawnee were so fully developed that he felt a close, personal connection to them. Henry Hanks of CNN called it \\"a near-flawless season\\". \\"Harvest Festival\\" received particularly strong reviews, with New York magazine writer Steve Kandell calling it the most pivotal episode of the season in terms of \\"resolving and resetting narrative stakes\\". Likewise, \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" was praised by several reviewers as one of the best episodes of the season, and Henry Hanks called it \\"one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season\\". As in past seasons, Nick Offerman continued to receive critical acclaim for his performance as Ron Swanson. By the third season, the character had taken on a cult status, and the term \\"Ron Swanson\\" was so commonly discussed on the social-networking website Twitter after \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" aired that it was listed among the site's trending topics, which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment. Rob Lowe received particularly strong reviews for his performance in \\"Flu Season\\" where his normally extraordinarily-physically fit character becomes extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Aziz Ansari received very positive reviews for his performance in \\"Soulmates\\", as did Adam Scott for his performance in \\"Media Blitz\\". While some commentators felt the Ann Perkins character seemed adrift and not working as well as the other cast members, others said they liked the new direction the character had taken this season. Eric Sundermann declared the relationship between Chris and Ann was described as \\"one of the most interesting parts of the show\\", whereas Joel Keller of TV Squad felt it was poorly handled and made Ann too passive. Some reviewers said the town of Pawnee itself has developed into a rich and interesting setting, comparing it to Springfield in the Fox animated series The Simpsons. Ratings Despite the critical success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, just as it had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households.These averages were determined by calculating the average of the number of episodes per season and the total viewership amounts for each episode within that season. The season three numbers can be found on this page, and the season one and two numbers can be found on List of Parks and Recreation episodes, all of which are cited by reliable sources. The calculations came out to be: Season 1: 32.11/6 episodes=5.45; Season 2: 112.34/24 episodes=4.68; Season 3: 76/16 episodes=4.75. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: \\"I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done a pretty good job of making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It‚Äôs very disconcerting.\\" Parks and Recreation saw a slight increase in viewership during its first episodes. The season debut, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\", was seen by an estimated 6.19 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 3.2 rating/8 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It marked the series' highest rating in that demographic, and the highest overall viewership since the series premiere episode from April 2009, which was seen by 6.77 million household viewers. The ratings quickly dropped, however, and by the third episode \\"Time Capsule\\" had dipped to 4.95 million household viewers, a more than 17 percent decline from the previous episode, \\"Flu Season\\". By the seventh episode, \\"Harvest Festival\\", viewership had dropped to 4.08 million households, one of the lowest ratings of the series. The ratings increased slightly after that point, with the viewership for the next episode \\"Camping\\" jumping up 39 percent to 5.15 million households. Ratings for the eleventh episode, \\"Jerry's Painting\\", were expected to be high due to a lead-in from Steve Carell's final episode as a regular cast member on The Office. However, the Parks and Recreation episode was seen by an estimated 4.71 million household viewers, a drop from the previous episode \\"Soulmates\\". Ratings were unusually low for Parks and Recreation during its last four episodes due to the timeslot changes and back-to-back pairing of the episodes: \\"The Fight\\" and \\"Road Trip\\" were seen by 4.55 million and 3.54 million households, respectively, while \\"The Bubble\\" and season finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\" were seen by 4.27 and 3.72 million households, respectively. Awards In 2011, Parks and Recreation was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first such nomination for the series. Amy Poehler received her second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Poehler said she was considering submitting the episodes \\"Flu Season\\" or \\"The Fight\\" for Emmy Award consideration. In June 2011, Parks and Recreation was nominated for three of the inaugural Critics‚Äô Choice Television Awards. The show itself was nominated for \\"Best Comedy Series\\", Amy Poehler was nominated for \\"Best Actress in a Comedy Series\\" and Nick Offerman was nominated for \\"Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\\". Also that month, Parks and Recreation was nominated for four TCA Awards: Program of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Comedy and Individual Achievement in Comedy awards for Offerman and Poehler. Offerman also hosted the TCA Awards in 2011.

The NCAA limits the total number of scholarships that may be awarded in all of its sponsored sports, and in football also limits the number of scholarships awarded in a given year. Those limits differ by sport and the division in which that school participates. Most conferences have additional rules governing signing NLI. NCAA Bylaw 15.5.6.1 limits FBS football programs to a total number of scholarships to 85 \\"counters\\" annually including 25 scholarships for \\"initial counters.\\" Counters (NCAA Bylaw 15.02.3) are individuals who are receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport, initial counters (NCAA Bylaw 15.02.3.1) are individuals who are receiving countable financial aid in a sport for the first time. Bylaw 13.9.2.3 limits schools to signing 28 NLI from initial signing day through May 31. Oversigning can occur in two ways. First, if a school signs a number of NLI that may bring their total number of counters above the NCAA limit of 85. Second would be to sign more than 25 NLI during the period between National Signing Day and May 31. Oversigning occurs in other sports but has received the most attention from media members and fans, in regard to Division I FBS college football. NCAA rules permit oversigning up to 28 NLI, though some college football fans view oversigning as unethical, arguing that it requires schools and coaches to be dishonest with young adult and adolescent recruits by promising them a roster spot and scholarship only to pull it before the person graduates or even makes the team. Atlantic Coast Conference Miami In a December 2010 feature on oversigning, ESPN's Outside the Lines profiled former University of Miami defensive lineman Stephen Wesley, who was told - in July 2010, just weeks before his senior season was to begin - that his scholarship would not be renewed. Miami and then-head coach Randy Shannon did not give an explanation for Wesley's dismissal from the team, but many believed (as Outside the Lines noted) Wesley was cut from the team to make room for Seantrel Henderson, who announced he would attend Miami just weeks before Wesley's dismissal. Big East Conference In the 2011 offseason, the University of Louisville men's basketball team found itself with a roster of 18 players‚Äîfive more than the NCAA limit of 13 scholarship players for that sport. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, the Cardinals had a 15-man roster, but two of these players were walk-ons, placing them within NCAA limits. Three scholarship players departed after the season, but coach Rick Pitino had initially signed a four-player freshman class, resulting in 14 scholarship players plus the two returning walk-ons. Then, coaching changes gave Pitino the opportunity to add a fifth freshman, former Tennessee commit Kevin Ware, and a future upperclass contributor, George Mason transfer Luke Hancock. These signings gave the Cardinals 16 scholarship players. The situation was resolved when three returning scholarship players agreed to become walk-ons for the 2011‚Äì12 season. All had originally come to Louisville as walk-ons, but had earned scholarships. What made this situation especially unusual is that two of the three were seniors who were expected to start in the coming season. One of the senior walk-ons, Kyle Kuric, was the Cardinals' only returning double-figure scorer. The other senior walk-on, Chris Smith, was the Cardinals' third-leading returning scorer. The four players with higher scoring averages than Smith were Preston Knowles (graduated), Kuric, Peyton Siva (returning), and Terrence Jennings (left for the NBA draft). Both were financially able to absorb being walk- ons‚ÄîKuric's parents are a neurosurgeon and a nurse practitioner, and Smith is the younger brother of NBA player J. R. Smith, who had paid his brother's way at U of L when he had to sit out the 2009‚Äì10 season as a transfer. Big Ten Conference Ohio State In an article posted June 25, 2011 by ABC news, James Jackson, former Ohio State University wide receiver, says he lost his scholarship due to oversigning. \\"They had an oversigning issue,\\" Jackson said. \\"They had to free up a few scholarships, and coach (Jim) Tressel told me I probably wouldn't play and maybe Ohio State wasn't the place for me.\\" Ohio State denies that Jackson was forced to transfer. \\"Our policy is as James Jackson stated: As long as a student-athlete maintains his/her academic standing, behaves appropriately and handles his/her responsibilities, he or she will retain their scholarship. We have no proof of any conversation between he and former head coach Jim Tressel,\\" After National Signing Day in 2011, Ohio State was oversigned by several players. During his Signing Day press conference, head coach Urban Meyer said he expected several recruits to not be signed, though Meyer did not give the specific number by which he had oversigned. Southeastern Conference Several universities within the Southeastern Conference (SEC) have frequently been accused of oversigning. Florida, Georgia, and Vanderbilt are usually noted as exceptions within the SEC due to their having signed the fewest total recruits among SEC teams over the past decade. Georgia head coach Mark Richt has condemned the process, saying \\"I don't want to oversign, then tell one of the kids we've already got, 'You've got no value to us' and toss him aside. I'm not going to do that.\\" On February 1, 2011, Sports Illustrated published a letter from the president of the University of Florida, Bernie Machen, in which Machen condemned oversigning-related practices - including grayshirting and the excessive use of medical disqualifications - as \\"morally reprehensible\\" and \\"repugnant.\\" Houston Nutt Rule In May 2009, the SEC passed a rule restricting its football teams to accepting no more than 28 National Letters of Intent each year. This move was widely viewed as a direct response to the University of Mississippi and its head coach, Houston Nutt, having promised 37 scholarships to new recruits for the 2009 season. Thus the rule is now commonly referred to as \\"The Houston Nutt Rule.\\" Alabama and Nick Saban 2010 =WSJ Medical Scholarship Concerns= On September 24, 2010, the Wall Street Journal published an article suggesting the University of Alabama and its head coach, Nick Saban, had encouraging some under-performing players to quit the team for medical reasons in order to gain a competitive edge. Former Alabama linebacker Chuck Kirschman said \\"I'm still kind of bitter,\\" and Coach Saban encouraged him to accept the scholarship because of a back problem that Kirschman believes he could have played through. Kirschman said the school offered in the summer of 2009 to pay for his graduate degree in business, an offer he accepted, and that he still gets some of the same perks as players. Kirschman completed his MBA in Finance. Charles Hoke, a former Alabama offensive lineman, took a medical scholarship in 2008 because of a shoulder problem, said the choice was left entirely up to him and was based on the many conversations he had with the team's doctors and trainers over the course of his junior year. Jeramie Griffin tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in August 2009. He said, \\"I came back in the spring and I was OK.\\" Griffin said that he was surprised football staff told him he had failed a physical. Griffin said, Saban asked him what he wanted to do besides playing football, and that Saban floated the possibility of a medical scholarship and asked if Griffin was interested in student coaching. Griffin said he doesn't contest the results of the physical and said it was \\"basically my decision\\" to forgo the rest of his playing career. Doug Walker, the school's associate athletic director for media relations, said \\"Decisions about medical disqualifications for student-athletes are made by medical professionals and adhere to the parameters outlined by the NCAA‚Ä¶and the Southeastern Conference.\\" On September 29, 2010 Coach Saban responded to questions about the Wall Street Journal Article, \\"We don't make the decision about medicals. I have nothing to do with that. Those are medical decisions made by our medical staff. I think we have one of the finest medical staffs in the country. I don't have any question about the fact every player we have given a medical to, it's been because of the medical opinion of the medical staff,\\" Saban said. \\"Those guys should not continue to play football because it would put their future in tremendous risk. Those decisions are always made in the best interest of the player. Whether the player agrees with that or not, I can't control. I don't make the decision. They don't make the decision as players. That's why we have a medical staff.\\" =WSJ Transfer Concerns= On November 25, 2010, the Journal reported that several former Alabama players claim Saban and Alabama lied about their reasons for leaving the school. On August 5, 2009, Saban made a statement in a press conference that included a reference to four players Price Hall, Brandon Fanney, Alonzo Lawrence and Jermaine Preyear. \\"These guys all did something. It doesn't make them bad people.‚Ä¶These guys didn't do what they were supposed to do here, whether it was for academic reasons or whatever. They're not going to be part of the program.\\" The players told The Wall Street Journal they committed no such violations and that Alabama and Saban had only claimed as much so as to protect the image of their program in the eyes of future recruits. Prince Hall, a starter and All-American as freshman, had been suspended for the 3rd time during the Spring according to published reports, the last being categorized as indefinite. Brandon Fanney, a 14-game starter from the previous season, had been suspended for rules violations during the Spring. Preyear, who decided to transfer six months after enrolling during the Spring, said he chose to leave over concerns about playing time. \\"I don't know any rules I could have broken.\\" Alonzo Lawrence reasons for transfer were unclear, but according to his high school coach his problems at Alabama \\"wasn't anything major,\\" and tied it to things like being late to team meetings. Lawrence transferred to Southern Miss before moving on to Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. =Saban's Exchange with another Reporter= On April 15, 2008, Saban was asked by reporter Ian Rapoport how he was going to handle the numbers and when does he you start to worry about it? Saban replied \\"I'm not worried about them. It'll all work out. I mean, the whole thing has a solution to every issue. You don't put yourself in a position where you don't know what's coming.\\" Rapoport respond, \\"So you're not going to tell us?\\" to which Saban replied \\"We know how it has to be managed, and it will be managed. It's none of your business. Aiight? And don't give me this stuff about the fans' need to know, because they don't need to know. Don't even ask. Aiight?\\" 2011 In early 2011, after National Signing Day, Saban and the University of Alabama again became the subjects of heavy media criticism after they again appeared to have oversigned. When asked about the appearance of being oversigned during his Signing Day press conference, Saban gave a 431-word response in which he denied being oversigned but refused to clarify the situation by explaining how many scholarship players departed the program after the 2010 season. Further raising questions about Saban and Alabama, Birmingham News journalist Kevin Scarbinsky revealed a few days after Saban's press conference that in numerous requests by the newspaper for the scholarship numbers of public universities in Alabama, the University of Alabama has been the only one to completely redact the numbers for every sport in which it participates. LSU and Les Miles In 2010, Louisiana State University (LSU) and head coach Les Miles were also the subjects of numerous oversigning allegations. In August, with his program at the scholarship limit for the year, Miles asked two recruits, Elliot Porter and Cameron Fordham, to wait until January 2011 to receive their previously promised scholarships. (This practice is known as \\"grayshirting.\\") Fordham chose to stay with the team, but Porter decided to leave the school. A third player, Houston Bates, had previously been asked to grayshirt and decided not to attend LSU, instead signing with Illinois. Porter joined the Kentucky football team that fall, but left during the season. He transferred back to LSU the next year but had to sit out the season due to transfer rules. Porter became the full-time starting center for LSU for the 2013 football season. Despite being trashed by the national media for downgrading Porter's scholarship offer to a grayshirt offer, Miles took Porter back with open arms. In December, ESPN's Outside the Lines broadcast a report in which former LSU quarterback Chris Garrett claimed LSU and Les Miles lied about the circumstances surrounding the school's decision not to renew Garrett's scholarship and Garrett's subsequent departure from LSU. South Carolina and Steve Spurrier In 2011, South Carolina, coached by Steve Spurrier, oversigned by several players. Both Oversigning.com and Rivals.com estimated South Carolina oversigned by 6 players when it signed 32 players in its 2011 class. Additionally, on the day before National Signing Day, South Carolina rescinded offers to two other recruits that had verbally committed to signing with the school. One of the recruits, Lorenzo Mauldin, had been committed to the school for months but learned he would not receive a scholarship offer when South Carolina faxed a notice of the rescinded offer to his high school on the day before Signing Day. Walter Banks, the coach of Jordan Montgomery, the other recruit whose scholarship offer was pulled the day before National Signing Day, told The Wall Street Journal, \\"I told [South Carolina coaches] this was foul. I didn't have a clue until 18 hours before signing day, and if they say anything else, they're lying.\\" Banks also told The State that South Carolina coaches are \\"no longer welcome\\" at his high school (South Lake High School in Groveland, Florida) saying, \\"I cannot look a kid and their parent in the face and say you can trust what a University of South Carolina coach says.\\" Spurrier admitted to The Wall Street Journal that \\"what we probably could've done earlier in the recruiting is tell them that this could happen.\\" He later added, \\"I think on [February 1] we alerted both of them, talked to them and said ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôm sorry. This is where we are. We got all these other commitments.‚Äô We didn't like doing this.\\" In late March 2011, Mauldin signed with Louisville saying that he came to believe that South Carolina coaches really didn't want him to qualify anyway. 2011 rule change In June 2011, the SEC presidents and chancellors unanimously passed a new conference rule that prohibits teams from signing more than 25 players to National Letter of Intent from December 1 through May 31. The league's coaches unanimously voted the day before to recommend maintaining the limit of 28.

He is a research scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory and Clarence Robinson Professor of Earth Science at George Mason University, in the United States. Hazen is the Executive Director of the Deep Carbon Observatory. Early life Hazen was born in Rockville Centre, New York, on November 1, 1948. His parents were Peggy Hazen (n√©e Dorothy Ellen Chapin; 1918‚Äì2002) and Dan Hazen (n√©e Daniel Francis Hazen, Jr.; 1918‚Äì2016). He spent his early childhood in Cleveland, near a fossil quarry where he collected his first trilobite at the age of about 9. The Hazen family moved to New Jersey, where Robert's eight-grade teacher, Bill Welsh, observed Robert's interest in his collection of minerals. Hazen later recalled \\"He gave me a starter collection of 100 specimens, mineral field guides, and mimeographed directions to Paterson and Franklin, New Jersey.\\" Hazen also had an early interest in music, starting with the piano at age 5, the violin at 6 and the trumpet at age 9.  Education  Hazen worked on his B.S. and S.M. (Master of Science) in Earth Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1971. He started with the intention of going into chemical engineering, but he was captivated by the enthusiasm of David Wones and converted to mineralogy. With Wones as advisor, he completed a masters thesis on cation substitution in trioctahedral micas; his publication in American Mineralogist was his first to be highly cited. He completed a Ph.D. in Mineralogy & Crystallography at Harvard University in 1975. His thesis, with Charles Burnham as advisor, involved learning how to use a 4-circle diffractometer to do high-pressure X-ray crystallography and applying it to olivine. This became a focus of his early career. While a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at Cambridge University in England, Hazen worked with Charles Prewitt to determine empirical relations for the effect of temperature and pressure on interatomic distances in oxides and silicates. Geophysical Laboratory In 1976, Hazen joined the Carnegie Institution's Geophysical Laboratory as a research associate. After a brief stint measuring optical properties of lunar minerals with Peter Bell and David Mao, he started to do X-ray crystallography with Larry Finger. He later recalled, \\"It was a match made in mineralogical heaven: Larry loved to write code, build machines, and analyze data; I loved to mount crystals, run the diffractometers, and write papers.\\" They collaborated for two decades and determined about a thousand crystal structures at variable pressures and temperatures, work summarized in their 1982 book Comparative Crystal Chemistry. Much of the work that Hazen was doing could be classified as mineral physics, a cross between geophysics and mineralogy. Although the field had pioneering contributions from the Nobel Prize winner Percy Bridgman and a student of his, Francis Birch, in the early- to mid-20th century, it did not have a name until the 1960s, and in the 1970s some scientists were concerned that a more interdisciplinary approach was needed to understand the relationship between interatomic forces and mineral properties. Hazen and Prewitt co-convened the first mineral physics conference; it was held on October 17‚Äì19, 1977 at the Airlie House in Warrenton, Virginia. High-temperature superconductors A model of a YBa2Cu3O7 unit cell. Cooled to very low temperatures, some materials experience a sudden transition where electrical resistance drops to zero and any magnetic fields are expelled. This phenomenon is called superconductivity. Superconductors have a host of applications including powerful electromagnets, fast digital circuits and sensitive magnetometers, but the very low temperatures needed make the applications more difficult and expensive. Until the 1980s, no superconductors existed above . Then in 1986 two IBM researchers, Georg Bednorz and K. Alex M√ºller, found a ceramic material with a critical temperature of . This set off a frenzied search for higher critical temperatures. A group led by Paul Chu at the University of Houston explored some materials made of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen (YCBO) and were the first to obtain a critical temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The YCBO samples had a mixture of black and green minerals, and although the researchers knew the average composition, they did not know the compositions of the two phases. In February 1987, Chu turned to Mao and Hazen, because they could determine the composition of small mineral grains in rocks. It took Mao and Hazen a week to determine the compositions; the black phase, which turned out to be the superconductor, was YBa2Cu3O7-Œ¥. Mao and Hazen determined that the crystal structure of the superconducting phase was like that of perovskite, an important mineral in Earth's mantle. Subsequently, Hazen's group identified twelve more high-temperature oxide superconductors, all with perovskite structures, and worked on organic superconductors. Origins of life giant tube worms near the Gal√°pagos hotspot, and may have been where life originated. By the mid-1990s, Hazen felt that his research had reached a \\"respectable plateau\\" where the main principles of how crystals compress were known. The questions he was asking were increasingly narrow and the answers rarely surprising. So he changed research directions to study life's chemical origins. This opportunity came when a colleague at George Mason University, Harold Morowitz, realized that the temperature and pressure at a hydrothermal vent might change the properties of water, allowing chemical reactions that ordinarily require the help of an enzyme. Enlisting the help of Hatten Yoder, a specialist in high pressure mineralogy, they tried subjecting pyruvate in water to high pressure, hoping for a simple reaction that would return oxaloacetate. Instead, an analysis by an organic geochemist, George Cody, found that they obtained tens of thousands of molecules. The publication of their results, which seemed to support the deep sea vent hypothesis, met with heavy criticism, especially from Stanley Miller and colleagues who believe that life emerged on the surface. Along with the general criticism that organic compounds would not survive long in hot, high pressure conditions, they pointed out several flaws in the experiment. In his book, Genesis, Hazen acknowledges that Stanley Miller \\"was basically right\\" about the experiments, but argues that \\"the art of science isn't necessarily to avoid mistakes; rather, progress is often made by making mistakes as fast as possible, while avoiding making the same mistake twice.\\" In subsequent work, the group formed biomolecules from carbon dioxide and water and catalyzed the formation of amino acids using oxides and sulfides of transition metals; and different transition elements catalyze different organic reactions. Homochirality The mirror-image forms of alanine Organic molecules often come in two mirror-image forms, often referred to as \\"right-handed\\" and \\"left- handed\\". This handedness is called chirality. For example, the amino acid alanine comes in a right-handed (D-alanine) and a left-handed (L-alanine) form. Living cells are very selective, choosing amino acids only in the left- handed form and sugars in the right-handed form. However, most abiotic processes produce an equal amount of each. Somehow life must have developed this preference (homochirality); but while scientists have proposed several theories, they have no consensus on the mechanism. Hazen investigated the possibility that organic molecules might acquire a chiral asymmetry when grown on the faces of mineral crystals. Some, like quartz, come in mirror-image forms; others, like calcite, are symmetric about their centers but their faces come in pairs with opposite chirality. With Tim Filley, an expert at organic chemical analysis, and Glenn Goodfriend, a geochemist, Hazen cleaned large calcite crystals and dipped them into aspartic acid. They found that each face of the crystal had a small preference for either left- or right-handed forms of aspartate. They proposed that a similar mechanism might work on other amino acids and sugars. This work attracted a lot of interest from the pharmaceutical industry, which needs to produce some of their drugs with a pure chirality. Mineral evolution At a Christmas party in 2006, the biophysicist Harold Morowitz asked Hazen whether there were clay minerals during the Archean Eon. Hazen could not recall a mineralogist ever having asked whether a given mineral existed in a given era, and it occurred to him that no one had ever explored how Earth's mineralogy changed over time. He worked on this question for a year with his closest colleague, geochemist Dimitri Sverjensky at Johns Hopkins University, and some other collaborators including a mineralogist, Robert Downs; a petrologist, John Ferry; and a geobiologist, Dominic Papineau. The result was a paper in American Mineralogist that provided a new historical context to mineralogy that they called mineral evolution. Based on a review of the literature, Hazen and his co-authors estimated that the number of minerals in the Solar System has grown from about a dozen at the time of its formation to over 4300 at present. (As of 2017, the latter number has grown to 5300.). They predicted that there was a systematic increase in the number of mineral species over time, and identified three main eras of change: the formation of the Solar System and planets; the reworking of crust and mantle and the onset of plate tectonics; and the appearance of life. After the first era, there were 250 minerals; after the second, 1500. The remainder were made possible by the action of living organisms, particularly the addition of oxygen to the atmosphere. This paper was followed over the next few years by several studies concentrating on one chemical element at a time and mapping out the first appearances of minerals involving each element. Deep Carbon Observatory Hazen and his colleagues started the Carbon Mineral Challenge, a citizen science project dedicated to accelerating the discovery of \\"missing\\" carbon-bearing minerals. Teaching As the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at George Mason University, Hazen developed innovative courses to promote scientific literacy in both scientists and non-scientists. With physicist James Trefil, he developed a course that they described as \\"science appreciation\\", aimed at non-scientists. It was organized around a total of 20 \\"Great Ideas of Science\\" that were later reduced to 18. In addition to writing about their ideas in several magazines, they turned the course into a book, Science Matters: Achieving Scientific Literacy. They used the principles to organize explanations of a \\"vast number of socially significant, fundamental, or environmentally crucial topics.\\" This was published with an amount of advance publicity that was unusual for a popular science book, including an article they wrote for the New York Times Sunday Magazine, praise from luminaries such as Isaac Asimov and physics Nobelist Leon Lederman, and a publicity tour. For an article in Science about the book, they provided the author with the original list of 20 ideas and invited readers to send in their comments. About 200 readers responded, generally supporting the idea of such a list while vehemently criticizing many of the particulars, including an informal style and sometimes vague language. Particularly criticized were numbers 1 (\\"The universe is regular and predictable\\") and 16 (\\"Everything on the earth operates in cycles\\"). Hazen and Trefil argued, in defense of point 1, that it was not intended as a defense of determinism and that they covered unpredictable phenomena like chaos; but they also used the responses to modify the list of ideas in subsequent editions. Hazen and Trefil went on to write three undergraduate textbooks: The Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1993), The Physical Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1995), and Physics Matters: An Introduction to Conceptual Physics (2004). Hazen used these as the basis for a 60-lecture video and audio course called The Joy of Science. Public engagement In 2008, Hazen was an outgoing member of the AAAS Committee on Public Understanding of Science and Technology. He and his wife Margee, noting that it is important for scientists to engage with the public but actually doing so does not help them get tenure, proposed a new award, The Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science, and established a fund for it. The first award, with a monetary prize of $5,000, was announced in 2010. Honors Hazen is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Mineralogical Society of America presented Hazen with the Mineralogical Society of America Award in 1982 and the Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2009. In 2016, he received its highest award, the Roebling Medal. He also served as Distinguished Lecturer and is a Past President of the Society. A mineral that was discovered in Mono Lake was named hazenite in his honor by Hexiong Yang, a former student of his. In 1986, Hazen received the Ipatieff Prize, which the American Chemical Society awards in recognition of \\"outstanding chemical experimental work in the field of catalysis or high pressure\\". For the book The Music Men, he and his wife Margaret received the Deems Taylor Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1989. For his popular and educational science writing, Hazen received the E.A. Wood Science Writing Award from the American Crystallographic Association in 1998, In 2012, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia presented Hazen with its Outstanding Faculty Award. Hazen has presented numerous named lectures at universities. He gave a Directorate for Biological Sciences Distinguished Lecture at the National Science Foundation in 2007, and was named the Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer for 2008‚Äì2010. In 2019, Hazen was named a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union. Publications Hazen is author of more than 350 articles and 20 books on science, history, and music. Refereed articles Hazen has 289 refereed publications that have been cited a total of over 11,000 times, for an h-index of 58.

Warren AFB, Wyoming. Overview The 90th Strategic Missile Wing was the fifth United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM wing, the fourth with the LGM-30B Minuteman I. In October 1962 construction began over an area of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado to construct 200 Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch silos. On 1 July 1963, the Air Force activated the 90th SMW Over the next year, four component strategic missile squadrons activated 200 minuteman missiles. In November 1972, SAC initiated the Minuteman Integrated Improvement Program. The program entailed silo hardening and upgrading command data buffers, which allowed for quicker missile retargeting. In addition to receiving upgraded silos and launcher control facilities, Warren also received new missiles, with the Minuteman I being replaced with LGM-30G Minuteman III between 1973-1975. In November 1982, in a decision statement for Congress, President Ronald Reagan stated his plan to deploy the MX missile (later designated the LGM-118 Peacekeeper) to superhardened silos located at Warren. In July 1984, construction began for Peacekeeper support facilities at Warren. From 1986 through 1988, 50 Peacekeepers were backfitted into silos formally occupied by Minuteman IIIs of the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron. The 400th achieved initial operational capability with 10 deployed Peacekeepers in December 1986. Full operational capability was achieved in December 1988 with 50 missiles. All of the 90th Wing's Minuteman III missiles were reduced from three warheads to a single warhead by START I between 1991-2001. Beginning in 2002 the Peacekeepers began to be inactivated for budgetary reasons, and by September 2005 the 400th SMS was inactivated. The three active Minuteman III squadrons are commanded by the 90th Operations Group. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Center (LCC) and an above-ground Launch Control Support Building (LCSB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground LCC Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number, 01 through 11, with 01 being the MAF.

Archimandrite Chrys√≥stomos Papasarant√≥poulos (Greek: ŒßœÅœÖœÉœåœÉœÑŒøŒºŒøœÇ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±œÉŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, 1903‚Äì1972) was a pioneering missionary of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Congo. Greece 1903-1960 Childhood Years Rev. Archimandrite Chrysostomos Papasarantopoulos was born Christos Papasarantopoulos in 1903 in Vasilitsi, Messenia, Greece to Theodoros Papasarantopoulos and Stavroula Trigourea (afterwards Nun Sebastiani), the seventh child of the family. He was born into a devout Christian home, and from childhood he devoted his life to Christ. At the age of 10 he lost his father, and was forced to leave school in order to work. At 15 years of age he left his family home in secret and went to settle at the Koroni monastery in order to pursue his longing for the spiritual life; however he soon left this monastery since his relatives would visit him and beg him to return to the family. Afterwards, he went to Kalamata, to the then well-known Hermitage of Panagoulakis (Holy Monastery of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary), known for its strict asceticism; here he became a monk. The excesses of the Igumen there and the very strict lifestyle of that Hermitage overcame him and left him with a permanent health problem. Later Years During the years 1920-1929 Archimandrite Chrysostomos stayed at the Gardikiou Monastery, in Messenia.Holy Metropolis of Messenia . Holy Monastery of Gardikiou. On May 4, 1926 he was ordained into the priesthood, and was appointed as the Igumen of that monastery. At some point he tonsured his mother as a Nun. For several years he served the surrounding villages as the officiating priest. During this period Fr. Chrysostomos found time to complete his school studies (via Homeschooling), and undertook to learn the French language. After the disestablishment of the Monastery of Gardikiou (due to lack of personnel), Fr. Chrysostomos transferred to the Metochion of the Holy Monastery of Voulkano, Chrysokellaria, near Koroni. He then came to Athens and joined the Petraki Monastery, where his main duty was that of father confessor for people of all ages and walks of life, becoming well respected and loved. In the years of occupation Fr. Chrysostomos went to Edessa where he served as the General Hierarchical Vicar and Protosyngellos. Subsequently, he was transferred to Kozani, Thessaloniki, and Athens, where he received his Secondary School Diploma. Eventually he returned again to the Petraki Monastery, from where he determined to enroll in the University of Athens Theological School. At the age of 55, in 1958, he finally received his theological degree. During the course of his studies in Athens he came into contact with certain colleagues of African descent, who may have inspired him towards his forthcoming mission. The African students at the University were from Uganda, and represented the first native Orthodox Christians from Uganda to be formally educated in the Orthodox faith. One of these fellow students, Theodore Nankyamas, would later play a prominent role and become one of the first Orthodox bishops in East Africa. Another, Demetrios Mumbale, would become the first Orthodox physician and founder of an Orthodox medical clinic in Uganda.Fr. Alexander Veronis (OCMC). Orthodox Concepts of Evangelism and Mission. In: Paul Wesley Chilcote, & Laceye C. Warner (Eds.). The Study of Evangelism: Exploring a Missional Practice of the Church. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008. pp.279-294.) In the event, after many years of faithful service in his native country, he experienced a strong leading, a true \\"Macedonian Call,\\" to go as a missionary to Africa.Makarios (Tillyrides) of Kenya. Sermon at a Memorial Service for the Pioneer Missionary Rev. Archimandrite Chrysostomos Papasarantopoulos, at the Church of St. Paul, Kagira, 29 December 1993. Adventures in the Unseen, Volume 1. Orthodox Research Institute, 2004. pp.115-119. Africa 1960-1972 Uganda At the age of 57 Fr. Chrysostomos decided to go on his mission to Africa. The Archbishop at that time, as well as his acquaintances, tried to discourage him on the pretext of his advanced age and state of health. However, during a trip to the Holy Land, he met the Patriarch of Alexandria Christophoros II from whom he obtained the blessing,Formal ecclesiastical permission to undertake an action is referred to as a \\"blessing\\". The blessing may be bestowed by a bishop or priest, or by one's own spiritual father. thus resolving to continue the mission. In 1960 Archimandrite Chrysostomos Papasarantopoulos went to Kampala, Uganda, where he worked for ten years before moving to Zaire to begin a new mission there.Stephen Hayes. Orthodox Mission in Tropical Africa. Missionalia (Journal of the Southern African Missiological Society)., citing: :Lemopoulos, George (ed). You shall be my witnesses. Tertios: Katerini, Greece. 1993. p.67. Through correspondence he also encouraged others to become involved in mission, among them the present Bishop Makarios of Riruta, Kenya. After years of repression by the British colonial regime and the disingenuous propaganda of the Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries who supported it, the Orthodox Church was in a perilous state.Stephen Hayes. Orthodox Mission in Tropical Africa. Missionalia (Journal of the Southern African Missiological Society)., citing: :Zoe Brotherhood (ed.). A Sign of God: Orthodoxy 1964. Athens: Zoe, 1964. p.384. Father Chrysostomos wrote about the first difficulties he encountered: > \\"...(there are) neither homes, nor churches, nor clergy.[...] the few Greek > families here live miles away from each other. Likewise the Black Orthodox > are also scattered in tens and hundreds of miles in the four cardinal > directions...\\" He began an extensive correspondence program, writing to friends, relatives and acquaintances who might be able to help in any way. Thus he slowly started to receive aid from Greece, Europe and America in the form of packages of clothing, cheques, utensils and other items. In another letter he wrote: > \\"...by the end of March 1961 the inauguration and opening of the small > church of our mission was completed...I have not yet learned the (Bantu) > language of Luganda, however I have learned Swahili to a considerable > extent. I speak it together mixed with English, and I am understood fairly > well.\\" Learning a new language at that age was not easy, but within a year of arriving in Africa, Father Chrysostomos could preach in Swahili. He provided catechesis, he taught, and performed the Divine Liturgy, and baptized numerous of the Indigenous peoples. In addition, he prepared others for the mission, guiding them towards the priesthood. In 1963 Father Chrysostomos became the spiritual founder of the missionary society \\"The Friends of Uganda.\\" This Society continues its mission today based in the city of Thessaloniki. Kenya, Tanzania, Congo He then expanded the mission to neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania (Tanganyika). In Nairobi he created another missionary station, stating \\"the work (of mission) is progressing, Orthodoxy is expanding.\\" He also completed a translation of the Divine Liturgy and various Prayers into Swahili. Although he made constant appeals for assistance in his correspondence to Greece, inviting others to join the mission, he received no response. At an advanced age, he preached often. For 10 years, Father Chrysostomos laboured in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, but also desired to preach in the country which is today called the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1970 Father Chrysostomos went to live in Congo to begin a new mission there, staying there for two years, that is, for the remainder of his life. Here he met with an even greater response from the Indigenous population, however he was beset by an enormous lack of material assistance and helpers to assist him. One month before his death, he wrote a letter saying: > \\"I love the Africans and am fully convinced that the Lord has brought me > here. I hope to use the few remaining days of my old age preaching and > teaching here. The place I am now located in is a large city (Kananga) of > 50,000 people near the central part of the Congo. The people are eager to > learn about Orthodox Christianity. But I am old and alone and my capacities > are now limited. I don't know how I'll manage, but the Lord Jesus will show > me, as He always has in the past. Remember me in your prayers.\\" Death On December 13, 1972 while travelling from Kananga to Lubumbashi he was overcome by profuse nose-bleeding. He returned to Kananga, celebrated the Divine Liturgy on Christmas Day, and died on December 29, 1972.

And on December 29, 1987 the Academy of Athens awarded him posthumously the silver medal of honor. Legacy Father Chrysostomos opened the road for modern Orthodox missionary activity in Africa. He started out at 57 years of age all by himself without any aid, and found himself in Africa preaching the Gospel. Numerous obstacles confronted him: racism, language barriers, primitive living conditions, lack of funds, limitations imposed upon him by superiors, ill health, poor diet, etc. Not one to despair easily, Fr. Chrysostomos would say that he managed \\"with God's help\\". After labouring for twelve years across Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Congo, and having learned the Swahili and French languages at a relatively old age, he died in Africa having started a huge task, which was continued with great success. Today there is a Metropolitan of the Orthodox Church in Kinshasa. Father Chrysostomos was the pioneer, who laid the foundations, on which the superstructure of Orthodoxy in Congo was raised up. Kenya is not a small country, but Congo is more than four times the size of Kenya. Father Chrysostomos was always on the move, traveling widely. His life was a continuous round of traveling, preaching, baptizing, planting churches and celebrating the Divine Liturgy. > As with all preachers of the Gospel, the full results of Fr. > Papasarantopoulos' missionary efforts in Africa will be known only to the > Lord of the Church.

Its namesake is a corruption of Wonalancet, a sachem or sagamore of the Penacook Native American tribe. Today the complex is home to office space, conference center, and university research facilities. History Operations From turbine to line shaft at Suffolk Mills, part of the River Transformed Exhibit. In 1830, the Suffolk Textile Company was established. Running off of hydropower and later steam power, the mill's buildings were soon built during the mass building mills in the city. During the Civil War, the mill was closed and rebuilt. In 1926, the Suffolk Mills were sold. The New England textile industry was in decline by World War I and collapsed after World War II yet the mill hung on. In 1950, the Wannalancit Textile Company moved into the mills, renaming them. In 1969, Colombian workers were brought in since they were used to the poor working conditions and knew how to operate textile machinery. The mills finally closed in 1981. Reuse Today, the Wannalancit Mills are an example of adaptive re-use as they contain offices. Part of the mills are owned by the University of Massachusetts Lowell as well as Farley White Interests, a Boston-based real estate investment and development company. Farley White purchased 75% of the complex in 1998 and began a significant renovation and re-tenanting campaign. This effort culminated in the repointing of the property's smokestack. In 2000, the owners of the mill utilized their smokestack for the city's largest Christmas tree, reaching 256 feet in height. Yearly lighting costs are around $30,000. In 2010, the \\"tree\\" wasn't put up as owners cited costs of lighting to be a determining cause. since that year the lighting has reappeared.

All species are easily recognized by the white longitudinal stripes across the head and thorax. The genus is subdivided in two subgenera, based on the presence of an even (subgenus Zaprionus) or odd (subgenus Anaprionus) number of white stripes. The species of the genus can be found in African and Southern Asia. One species, Zaprionus indianus, has invaded the New World. Description All species in the genus Zaprionus are easily identified by the longitudinal white stripes bordered by black stripes running across the top of the head and thorax. Species of the subgenus Zaprionus have 4 or 6 white stripes while the species of the subgenus Anaprionus have 5 or 7 white stripes. The general body color varies across species from yellowish to dark brown. Several species of the subgenus Zaprionus have one or more stout and sometimes composite spines on the forelegs.Yassin A and David JR. (2010) Revision of the Afrotropical species of Zaprionus (Diptera, Drosophilidae), with descriptions of two new species and notes on internal reproductive structures and immature stages. ZooKeys 51:33‚Äì72. Coloration The characteristic black and white 'zebra' stripes of this genus have two different origins. In the simplest form, the white stripes are caused by an absence of the pigment in the cuticle. This mechanism is found in species of the subgenus Anaprionus. The absence of pigmentation also occurs in the species of the subgenus Zaprionus, probably complemented by a separate mechanism. In these species, the white stripes contain many long and bent trichomes (fine outgrowths) that have a groove and contain two cavities, polarizing the light. The black stripes are caused by pigmentation. Distribution Members of this genus can be found in the tropics of most continents. The species of the subgenus Zaprionus are found primarily in Africa, while the species of the subgenus Anaprionus are found in Southeast Asia. Two species, Zaprionus ghesquierei and Zaprionus indianus have expanded their range in recent times. Zaprionus ghesquierei has invaded Hawai ªi,O'Grady PM, Beardsley JW and Perreira WD.

Taxonomy Zaprionus indianus foreleg with composite spines charactertistic for the Zaprionus vittiger species groupThe genus Zaprionus was described in 1902 by Daniel William Coquillett.Coquillett DW. (1902) New Diptera from Southern Africa. Proceedings of the United States National Museum 24:27‚Äì32. He considered the genus closely related to the genus Drosophila. Molecular studies have confirmed this relationship, and the genus Zaprionus is positioned within the paraphyletic genus Drosophila. Within the genus, species with an odd number of stripes are assigned to the subgenus Anaprionus, while the species with an even number of stripes are assigned to the subgenus Zaprionus.Chassagnard MT. (1988) Esquisse phylog√©n√©tique du genre Zaprionus Coq. (Diptera: Drosophilidae) et description de trois nouvelles esp√®ces afrotropicales. Nat. Can. 115:305‚Äì322. Species within the subgenus Zaprionus were traditionally subdivided in two species groups, armatus and inermis, based on the presence or absence of special spines on the forelegs.Chassagnard MT and Tsacas L. (1993) Le sous-genre Zaprionus S.Str.: d√©finition de groupes d'esp√®ces et r√©vision du sous-groupe vittiger (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Ann. Soc. Entomol. Fr. 29:173‚Äì194. The armatus species group was further subdivided into three species subgroups based on the type of spines. The species of the armatus species subgroup have several normal spines. The single spine on forelegs of the species of the tuberculatus species subgroup consists of a large spine positioned on a tubercle with a smaller spine near the base of the spine. Finally, the species of the vittiger species subgroup had a row of composite spines generally positioned on small tubercles. Recent molecular studies have shown that this subdivision of the Zaprionus subgenus is incorrect. The ornamentation has evolved multiple times and is not a reliable characteristic for classification. The tuberculatus species group is now part of the group lacking ornamentation (inermis), and the closet relatives of species with a large composite spines are closely related to species without such a spine. The vittiger species subgroup is now a species group and a new species group, neglectus, has been erected for one species placed at the root of the Zaprionus subgenus.

Known at the time as tonal realism or Meldrumism, the movement was founded by artist and art teacher Max Meldrum, who developed a unique theory of painting, the \\"Scientific Order of Impressions\\". He argued that painting was a pure science of optical analysis, and believed that a painter should aim to create an exact illusion of spatial depth by carefully observing in nature tone and tonal relationships (shades of light and dark) and spontaneously recording them in the order that they had been received by the eye. Meldrum's followers‚Äîamong the most notable being Clarice Beckett, Colin Colahan and Albert Newbury‚Äîbegan staging group exhibitions at the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1919. They favoured painting in adverse weather conditions, and often went out together in the morning or towards evening in search of fog and wintry wet surfaces, which provided increased spatial effects. Their subtle, \\"misty\\" depictions of Melbourne's beaches and parks, as well as its everyday, unadorned suburbia, show an interest in the interplay between softness and structure, nature and modernity. The movement peaked during the interwar period, and its lingering influence can be seen in experimental works by other Australian artists, such as Lloyd Rees and Roland Wakelin. Although dismissed by many of their art world contemporaries, today the Australian tonalists are well-represented in Australia's major public art galleries. The minimum of means they used to distil the essence of their subjects has drawn comparisons to the haiku form of poetry, and the movement has been described as a precursor to modernist styles of painting, such as minimalism and conceptualism. History Max Meldrum The main exponent of Australian tonalism was Melbourne artist Max Meldrum. In 1899, he won the National Gallery of Victoria Art School's Travelling Scholarship Award, and went to Paris to further his training. Dissatisfied with the academic teachings there, as well as the avant-garde, he instead taught himself and developed a unique theory of painting based on the importance of tonal values and objective optical analysis, what he termed the \\"Scientific Order of Impressions\\". When applied, his photometric painting system resulted in simple representational works characterised by a \\"misty\\" or atmospheric quality.Misty Moderns: Australian Tonalists 1915-1950 , Art Gallery of South Australia. Retrieved on 5 December 2010. Meldrum proposed: Meldrum returned to Melbourne in 1912, established an art school at Elizabeth Street and began publishing his theories of art, which created a storm in the Australian art world. His school of painting attracted equally passionate followers and critics, and artists who adopted Meldrum's methods became derisively known as \\"Meldrumites\\". They rejected the then-popular Heidelberg School tradition with its emphasis on colour and narrative, and attacked various forms of modern art which Meldrum considered to be ego-based and technically inferior.Kinnane, Garry. Colin Colahan: A Portrait. Melbourne University Publishing, 1996. , p. 5 In 1918, incensed at Meldrum's defeat in the election for president of the Victorian Artists' Society, his students formed a breakaway group, the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society. The group often went on plein air painting trips around and outside Melbourne. When painting still life, the Australian tonalists set their easels at least six metres away from their subject, and painted with eyes half closed, or wore sunglasses, to aid their perception of different tones. Meldrum's students staged their first group exhibition at the Athenaeum Gallery in 1919. Presented as a unified whole, the two hundred and five works on show were uniformly displayed in narrow black frames, and in the catalogue, numbers, rather than titles, were assigned to each piece. The \\"radically humble\\" qualities of their art were overshadowed by controversy surrounding the show.

In 2008, the Art Gallery of South Australia debuted Misty Moderns, the first major exhibition to cover Australian tonalism since the 1960s. Apart from Meldrum, Misty Moderns featured works by 17 of Meldrum's pupils, as well as artists who experimented with his tonalist system, including Lloyd Rees, Roland Wakelin, Roy de Maistre and Elioth Gruner.Edwards, David.

This FM synth itself has stereo audio outputs, an input for a purpose-built four-octave keyboard, and a pair of MIDI Input/Output ports that could be used for normal MIDI on the second revision of the CX5M but only management of data from a Yamaha DX7 on the first model. Specification The CX5M was built to the MSX standard, which included slots for inserting programmed cartridges. These extended the machine's capability, accepting a range of games, office applications and so on. Yamaha produced a range of cartridges including a programmer for Yamaha's DX range of FM keyboards and a real-time sequencer. Two of these, the Voice Editor and Music Composer, allowed the user to program a bank of 48 sounds for the CX5's own built in synthesizer and to sequence up to eight channels of music, controlling the built-in module or external instruments via MIDI, in step-time using a musical-stave input screen. Yamaha SFG-01 FM Synthesizer Unit (internals): 8ch 4op FM sound chip YM2151 was used for multitimbral sounds and composite sinusoidal modeling (CSM) singing voice. Three versions of the CX5M were released. The first contained as its FM module the SFG-01, which could not receive external MIDI note information; it required a proprietary keyboard and only used its MIDI port was an output to send data to Yamaha's then-flagship DX7. The second version, the CX5M II (or CX7M/128 in Japan -- for details, see CX7/128. ), upgraded the FM system to the SFG-05, which supported MIDI input and thus allowed the internal FM synth to be played by any external MIDI keyboard. There was also a later CX5M II with some smaller differences.

The Rangers won the series, 4-2, but would ultimately lose to the National League champion, the St. Louis Cardinals, in the 2011 World Series. The series began on October 8, and ended on October 15. The series was the 42nd in league history. Fox televised all games in the United States. Games 1, 2, and 6 were played at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, while games 3, 4, and 5 were played at Comerica Park in Detroit. This was the first postseason meeting between the Rangers and the Tigers. The 2011 ALCS marked the first time the Tigers appeared in the ALCS (and the postseason overall) since 2006, while the Rangers were playing in their second consecutive appearance. As of 2020, this is the last ALCS to not feature a team from the AL East. Summary Texas Rangers vs. Detroit Tigers ‚Ä†: postponed from October 9 due to rain Game summaries Game 1 Saturday, October 8, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas The Tigers loaded the bases in the first inning with one out, but C. J. Wilson escaped the jam when Magglio Ord√≥√±ez grounded into a double play. The Rangers scored two runs in the second on a triple from David Murphy and a single from Ian Kinsler. Nelson Cruz added a solo home run in the fourth. After a 41-minute rain delay, Austin Jackson doubled in the Tigers' first run. Then after two walks loaded the bases, a wild pitch brought home Jackson to make the score 3‚Äì2 Rangers. After a second rain delay, Michael Gonzalez relieved Wilson and got Alex Avila to ground out to second with the bases loaded. Rick Porcello pitched two innings of relief of Verlander and the bullpens took over from there. After the Rangers bullpen threw innings of scoreless relief, Neftal√≠ Feliz came on to get the save. After allowing a lead-off single, Feliz struck out the next three batters to save it for the Rangers. Game 2 Monday, October 10, 2011 ‚Äì 4:19 pm (EDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas Game 2 was originally scheduled for October 9, but was postponed hours before it began due to the forecast of heavy rain in the area, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the previous game. However, the rain never actually came; forecasts just prior to what would have been the beginning of the game indicated only a 10% chance of rain. Josh Hamilton and Adri√°n Beltr√© each had an RBI in the first to give the Rangers an early lead. However, Ryan Raburn hit a three-run home run in the third to give the Tigers the lead, chasing Derek Holland out of the game. Nelson Cruz hit a home run in the seventh with no outs off Max Scherzer to tie the game at three, chasing Scherzer out of the game as well. The Rangers loaded the bases with no outs in the ninth against Tigers' closer Jos√© Valverde, but Valverde escaped the jam with a shallow fly ball and a 3‚Äì2‚Äì3 double play, leading to the Rangers' first postseason extra-inning game. After two scoreless innings from the bullpen, the Rangers again loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the 11th inning. This time, however, the Rangers ended the game when Nelson Cruz hit a game-winning grand slam, the first officially recorded walk-off grand slam in Major League Baseball postseason history and the first walk-off win in Rangers' postseason history. Game 3 Tuesday, October 11, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan The Rangers began the game with three straight hits from Ian Kinsler, Elvis Andrus, and Josh Hamilton scoring a run. Tiger starter Doug Fister, however, limited the damage by getting Michael Young to ground into a double play and striking out Adri√°n Beltr√©. The Tigers tied the game in the bottom of the fourth on a V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez solo home run. The Tigers took the lead in the fifth on a two-out two-strike hit by Miguel Cabrera. The Tigers made it 3‚Äì1 with another solo home run by Jhonny Peralta. They added another run on an Austin Jackson single. The Tigers extended their lead to 5‚Äì1 on yet another solo home run in the seventh by Miguel Cabrera. The Rangers cut the lead to 5‚Äì2 in the eighth on Ian Kinsler's groundout off of Joaquin Benoit that scored Yorvit Torrealba, who doubled to lead off the inning off of Doug Fister. Jos√© Valverde came on in the ninth to get the save. He worked around a leadoff double by Josh Hamilton to secure the Tigers' first victory of the series. Game 4 Wednesday, October 12, 2011 ‚Äì 4:19 pm (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan After a 133-minute rain delay, Game 4 commenced. The Tigers rallied for two runs in the bottom of the third inning on singles by Brandon Inge and Ryan Raburn. Miguel Cabrera drove them in with a two-run double. The Rangers got on the board in the sixth with a David Murphy single and an Ian Kinsler double. Elvis Andrus tied the game with a hit of his own. The Rangers grabbed the lead on a single by Michael Young after a wild pick- off throw to first allowed Andrus to advance to second base. Rick Porcello struggled in the seventh, allowing two singles, chasing him from the game. Al Alburquerque walked a batter to load the bases, but left them stranded. Brandon Inge tied the game with a solo home run in the seventh inning. In the eighth, the Tigers threatened when Miguel Cabrera walked and V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez singled to advance Cabrera to third. Delmon Young hit a deep fly ball to Nelson Cruz, but he caught it and threw it to home plate to tag Cabrera out. In the 11th, the Rangers grabbed a 4‚Äì3 lead on a leadoff double by Josh Hamilton and a one-out single by Mike Napoli. Nelson Cruz then hit his fourth home run of the series, a three-run shot to make it 7‚Äì3 Rangers. That would be the final score as the Tigers went down in order in the bottom of the inning. Game 5 Thursday, October 13, 2011 ‚Äì 4:19 pm (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan The Rangers struck quickly in the first inning against Justin Verlander on a leadoff double from Ian Kinsler, a bunt from Elvis Andrus, and sacrifice fly from Josh Hamilton. Avila homered for Detroit in the third inning to tie it at 1. Delmon Young gave Detroit the lead with a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth. Hamilton tied the game up in the fifth inning for the Rangers after Kinsler walked with one out and moved to second after an Andrus single. The Tigers rallied for four runs in the sixth inning on a Ryan Raburn single, a Miguel Cabrera double, a V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez triple, and a Delmon Young homer to make it 6‚Äì2 Tigers. In doing so, they became the first team to hit for a \\"combined\\" natural cycle in four consecutive at bats. The Rangers chipped away with another home run from Nelson Cruz, this time a two-run shot, which chased Verlander out of the game and brought Texas within three runs. In the ninth, Josh Hamilton doubled with two outs off of Phil Coke and scored on Michael Young's single. Adri√°n Beltr√© walked to put the tying run on base, but Coke got Mike Napoli to ground out to second for the save. Game 6 Saturday, October 15, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas Looking to force a decisive Game 7, the Tigers struck first on a solo home run in the first by Miguel Cabrera. They added another solo shot in the second by Jhonny Peralta with one out to make the score 2‚Äì0 Tigers. However, any chance the Tigers had of forcing a Game 7 would fall apart courtesy of a nine-run Rangers third inning. After Ian Kinsler grounded sharply to Brandon Inge for the first out, Elvis Andrus walked followed by a single from Josh Hamilton. Michael Young, who had been in a terrible slump the entire postseason, doubled down the left-field line sending both runners home to tie it at two. Adri√°n Beltr√© singled, scoring Michael Young. Following walks for both Mike Napoli and Nelson Cruz, the Tigers pulled Max Scherzer and put in Daniel Schlereth. David Murphy singled home both Napoli and Beltr√©, and with David Murphy and Nelson Cruz on first and second, respectively. Tiger starter Rick Porcello was brought in to face Endy Ch√°vez; the Rangers countered by pinch-hitting Craig Gentry, who reached on a fielder's choice. Kinsler singled to score Cruz and Murphy. Andrus reached on a fielder's choice, loading the bases. Michael Young finished the inning by doubling down the right-field line, sending home Kinsler and Andrus. Young would become the first player in LCS history to have two extra-base hits in the same inning and fourth in the postseason overall, the other three occurring in the World Series. Looking for a comeback, the Tigers got two back on an Austin Jackson home run in the top of the fifth, chasing Holland, but the Rangers answered with a Josh Hamilton sacrifice fly in the bottom of the fifth to make it 10‚Äì4 Rangers. The Rangers extended the lead to 12‚Äì4 in the sixth and 15‚Äì4 with a home run from Young and the sixth home run of the series from Nelson Cruz in the seventh to rout the Tigers. The Tigers scored their last run on a second solo home run from Miguel Cabrera. Neftal√≠ Feliz came on in the ninth inning for the Rangers in a non-save situation. He retired Brandon Inge on a pop-up for the last out, sealing the Rangers a second consecutive trip to the World Series. In hitting a postseason-record six home runs throughout the series, including two in extra innings (one being a walk-off grand slam), Nelson Cruz earned the Series MVP award.

The book exposes the war crimes and corruption of the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan government army using black humour and gonzo journalism. Overview After becoming frustrated with celebrity culture, Bussmann became inspired by the American peace activist and conflict resolution expert John Prendergast. Bussmann traveled to Uganda and began investigating the war crimes of Joseph Kony. Part investigative journalism, part dark comedy and part romantic satire, the story is couched in the author's unrequited attempt to get a date with Prendergast. Reception Reviewers consistently found the book to be truly funny, although some believed that her use of comedy in horrific situations was frequently inappropriate. In The New York Times, Daniel Bergner reported that John Prendergast enjoyed introducing himself to a person he spotted reading the book.

Votebots attempts to act like a human, but conduct voting in an automated manner in order to impact the result of the poll. A variety of votebot programs, targeted different kinds of services from normal websites to web applications, are sold online by individuals and groups. Like Web crawlers, a votebot can be customized to perform tasks in various environment or target different websites. Simple votebots are easy to code and deploy, yet they are often effective against many polls online, as the developer of the poll software must take this kind of attack into account and do extra work to defend against it.  Techniques used  The WWW is built on HTTP protocol to transfer information. To imitate legitimate user behavior, such as voting in an online poll, the attacker sends a HTTP request to particular server hosting the poll.  Target analysis  Analyzing the target, or the voting project, should be done before actually building the votebot. When handling a voting website for example, one needs to do some webpage analysis on the target, extracting the request URL of the voting action as well as some HTTP header settings to cheat the website. There are many tools which help people to analyze the web, such as Firebug and httpanalyzer. One can trace the voting process of HTTP packages by these tools and find the right voting target and some simple protecting tricks used by websites, such as referrer verification.  Preparation  Before sending requests, the attacker must carefully analyze the target and identify potential attack vectors. During analysis, the attacker must determine if HTTP sessions (maintained via cookies) are necessary to consider or not. For example, an online poll could require a session so that only authorized users can vote.  HTTP request  Crafting an HTTP request defines how an actual user would behave based on parameters defined in the request. Two HTTP request methods are useful in voting, POST and PUT. Request methods are simply different ways to send data to a certain endpoint (i.e., a poll about \\"How Many Users Like The Votebots Article?\\"). The below is a simple Python example using httplib2 to send messages (cited from httplib2 wiki): >>> from httplib2 import Http >>> from urllib import urlencode >>> h = Http() >>> data = dict(name=\\"Joe\\", comment=\\"A test comment\\") >>> resp, content = h.request(\\"http://bitworking.org/news/223/Meet-Ares\\", \\"POST\\", urlencode(data)) >>> resp {'status': '200', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked', 'vary': 'Accept- Encoding,User-Agent', 'server': 'Apache', 'connection': 'close', 'date': 'Tue, 31 Jul 2007 15:29:52 GMT', 'content-type': 'text/html'}  Human action simulation  In many voting projects, developers try to distinguish the bots from legal users. They may use the strategy talked about below, and the votebots try to bypass their barriers or detecting methods to successfully vote at the website. For example, some websites restrict the number of votes one IP address can make in a time period. Votebots can bypass this rule by proxy its IP address frequently to cheat the website. Another frequently used strategy is to analyze the account created by a votebot to tell any difference from the normal accounts created by human beings, or to analyze the action history of accounts in the system to find out potential votebots creating ones. Votebots, on the other hand, try to simulate human action such as logging in and out as well as sharing some articles in some social network service before voting.  Usual target  YouTube is reported to be a big victim of votebots. Many small, temporary voting projects are also usual target of votebots. Many people try to program or buy malicious scripts to vote for themselves in some processes, and it is hard to count the number of attacks that happen every day.  Anti-votebot  As talked above, web developers want to distinguish votebot from legal voting users in voting projects. Normal ways includes IP checking, account-handling, Turing test (e.g. CAPTCHA) and account action analysis.

The series was the 42nd NLCS in league history. The series began on October 9 to accommodate the World Series, which was scheduled to begin on October 19. TBS televised all games in the United States with Game 1 starting at 4:05pm EDT. Games 1, 2 and 6 were played at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while the other games were played at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. By coincidence, Brian Anderson, who usually called Brewers games on Fox Sports Wisconsin during the regular season, did the play- by-play for the NLCS on TBS, along with Ron Darling and John Smoltz. Anderson filled in for regular TBS lead baseball announcer Ernie Johnson, who was tending to a son in the hospital. This was the Brewers' first-ever appearance in the NLCS, having moved to the National League in 1998. As an American League team, the Brewers made the ALCS in their pennant season of 1982, defeating the California Angels, 3‚Äì2. Thus, the Brewers became the first franchise to play in the LCS as a member of each league. The Cardinals, meanwhile, appeared in the NLCS for the first time since winning the 2006 World Series. This was a rematch of the 1982 World Series (a.k.a. the \\"Suds Series\\", with both cities associated with the brewing industry with Milwaukee‚Äôs Miller Brewing Company, Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, and Pabst Brewing Company and St. Louis, whose Anheuser-Busch company is namesake of the Cardinals' ballpark), which the Cardinals won, 4‚Äì3. The Cardinals would go on to defeat the Texas Rangers in seven games in the World Series.

Game 3 Wednesday, October 12, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri Rafael Furcal hit a leadoff single in the first inning off Yovani Gallardo, moved to second on a wild pitch and back-to-back RBI doubles by Jon Jay and Albert Pujols made it 2‚Äì0 Cardinals. Two walks loaded the bases before Yadier Molina's ground-ball double-play and David Freese's double scored a run each. Gallardo and three Milwaukee relievers held the Cardinals scoreless for the rest of the game. In the second, three consecutive leadoff singles off of Chris Carpenter put the Brewers on the board. After a fly ball moved Jerry Hairston to third, he scored on Gallardo's sacrifice fly. Next inning, Mark Kotsay's home run made it a one-run game, but Carpenter and four relievers held the Brewers scoreless for the rest of the game as the Cardinals' 4‚Äì3 win gave them a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 Thursday, October 13, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri Brewers starter Randy Wolf kept Milwaukee from falling into a 3‚Äì1 series deficit, throwing seven stellar innings, striking out six batters, but allowed home runs to Matt Holliday in the second and Allen Craig in the third to put the Cardinals up 2‚Äì0.

The Brewers went up 3‚Äì2 in the fifth on a single by Ryan Braun off of Mitchell Boggs with the run charged to starter Kyle Lohse, and added an insurance run in the sixth on a crucial error by Ryan Theriot on George Kottaras's ground ball. Though the Cardinals had the tying run at the plate in three of the last four innings, Wolf, along with relievers Francisco Rodr√≠guez and John Axford, shut the Cardinals down to even the series at two games apiece, guaranteeing that the series would end in Milwaukee. It was also the Brewers' first playoff win on the road since Game 1 of the 1982 World Series. Game 5 Friday, October 14, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri The Cardinals took advantage of four Milwaukee errors to grab a 3‚Äì2 series lead. Yadier Molina's one-out RBI double with runners on first and second put them on the board in the second off of Zack Greinke. One out later, an error on Jaime Garcia's ground ball scored two more runs. Garcia's groundout with runners on second and third in the fourth made it 4‚àí0 Cardinals. Corey Hart's RBI single in the fifth provided the only run of the game for the Brewers. The Cardinals added to their lead on Albert Pujols's RBI single in the sixth and Matt Holliday's two- run double in the eighth off of Marco Estrada. Octavio Dotel got the win in relief of Garc√≠a and Jason Motte earned another save with shutout innings. Game 6 Sunday, October 16, 2011 ‚Äì 8:05 pm (EDT) at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Cardinals got off to a quick start, scoring four runs off Shaun Marcum in the first. Lance Berkman got things started with an RBI single. Eventual series MVP David Freese hit a three-run blast to extend their early lead. Marcum would last only this one inning. The Brewers got a run right back on a leadoff solo shot by Corey Hart in the bottom half of the inning off of Edwin Jackson, but the Redbirds would make it a four run game again as Rafael Furcal homered to make the score 5‚Äì1 in the second off of Chris Narveson. Milwaukee would start to claw their way back in their half of the inning, as Rickie Weeks hit a leadoff home run and Jonathan Lucroy hit a two-run home run to make the score 5‚Äì4. In the third, however, Albert Pujols led off with a solo shot of his own. They then loaded the bases on a single, double and intentional walk before Nick Punto's sacrifice fly scored a run and moved the runners up. LaTroy Hawkins relieved Narveson and allowed a two-run single to Allen Craig. In the bottom of the fourth, back-to-back doubles by Jerry Hairston and Yuniesky Betancourt off of Fernando Salas made it 9‚Äì5 Cardinals, but in the fifth, Kameron Loe allowed back-to-back leadoff singles to Matt Holliday and Freese before Yadier Molina's fielder's choice scored a run. After Punto struck out, Adron Chambers's sacrifice fly made it 11‚Äì5 Cardinals. Ryan Braun's groundout in the bottom half off of Marc Rzepczynski scored the last run for the Brewers while the Cardinals added a run in the eighth off of Francisco Rodr√≠guez on Pujols's RBI single.

She was a Queen of Bithynia by marriage to Socrates Chrestus and later married to Lycomedes of Comana. Life Orsabaris was of Greek Macedonian and Persian ancestry. She was the youngest daughter born to King Mithridates VI of Pontus from an unnamed concubine.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.114 Orsabaris was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. Queen of Bithynia Orsabaris was betrothed or had married as her first husband the Bithynian prince, usurper Socrates Chrestus. Socrates Chrestus was a political ally to her father; as well he was her paternal second cousin. This possibility is based on coins minted after 72 BC, found at the Bithynian city of Prusias ad Mare, which bears the inscription of Orsabaris‚Äô name. These coins reveal Orsabaris‚Äô full name and her royal title in Greek. An example of this coinage is, on one surviving coin, on the obverse side inscribes the full name and royal title of Orsabaris in Greek: ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒôŒ£Œ£ŒóŒ£ ŒúŒüŒ•Œ£ŒóŒ£ ŒüŒ°Œ£ŒüŒíŒëŒ°ŒôŒüŒ£, which means of Queen Mousa Orsobaris, showing her portrait. On the reverse side of the coin, is inscribed in Greek: Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ•Œ£Œ©Œù Œ§Œ©Œù Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ£ ŒòŒëŒõŒëŒ£Œ£Œó, showing the head of Heracles. The city of Prusias ad Mare was the city that the Pontian paternal ancestors of Orsabaris originated from. Socrates Chrestus had died by the time the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman Triumvir and General Pompey in 63 BC. Orsabaris was captured by Pompey and it seems that she was one of the few remaining relatives from the family of Mithridates VI, whose life was spared by the Romans. Orsabaris became a political prisoner of Pompey and served to adorn his triumph parade in Rome in 61 BC. After Pompey's triumph parade in Rome, Orsabaris was released by the Romans and she returned to Anatolia. Second marriage Orsabaris married a nobleman from Bithynia who was of Cappadocian Greek descent called Lycomedes of Comana, who was the priest of the goddess Bellona and priest-ruler of the temple-state of Comana, Cappadocia. Lycomedes ruled as priest-ruler from 47 BC until after 30 BC. Orsabaris through her marriage, became a ruler of the temple-state and had a daughter with Lycomedes called Orodaltis. The Romans had approved the status of Lycomedes, Orsabaris and their family, as they ruled over Comana for a substantial period. Orsabaris and her family could be viewed as potential successors of Mithridates VI on the Pontian throne, however the Kingdom of Pontus at the time became a Roman Client State who was ruled by Orsabaris' half-paternal brother Pharnaces II of Pontus; the sons of Pharnaces II and eventually by Polemon I of Pontus.

Three divisional winners and a fourth team‚Äîa wild card‚Äîplayed in two series. TBS televised all games in the United States (except Game 3 of the Brewers‚ÄìDiamondbacks series, which aired on TNT due to scheduling conflicts with the ALDS). The regular season finished on September 28, with the National League playoffs beginning October 1. Under MLB's playoff format, no two teams from the same division were matched up in the Division Series, regardless of whether their records would normally indicate such a matchup. Home field advantage went to the team with the better regular-season record with the exception of the wild card team, which defers home field advantage regardless of record. The matchups are: * (1) Philadelphia Phillies (East Division champions, 102‚Äì60) vs. (4) St. Louis Cardinals (Wild Card qualifier, 90‚Äì72): Cardinals won the series, 3‚Äì2. * (2) Milwaukee Brewers (Central Division champions, 96‚Äì66) vs. (3) Arizona Diamondbacks (West Division champions, 94‚Äì68): Brewers won the series, 3‚Äì2.

The Brewers and Diamondbacks also met for the first time, having both joined the National League in 1998‚ÄîArizona as an expansion team and Milwaukee in a move from the American League after the AL expanded by adding the Tampa Bay Rays. The Brewers-Diamondbacks series was also notable as the first postseason series played between two teams in ballparks with retractable roofs.

On September 17, the Phillies clinched the NL East title for the fifth consecutive season. *On September 23, after a win over the Marlins and the Cardinals' loss to the Cubs, the Milwaukee Brewers clinched the NL Central title. It was the Brewers' first NL Central title since joining the division in 1998, their first of any kind since winning the 1982 American League pennant, when they won the AL East title, and their first playoff berth since 2008. *Also on September 23, the Arizona Diamondbacks clinched the NL West, their first time since 2007. *On September 28, after making up over a 10-game deficit in the final month of the season and going into the season's last day tied with the Braves for the last playoff berth, the St. Louis Cardinals clinched the NL Wild Card by beating the Astros while the Braves lost in extra innings to the Phillies. Matchups Philadelphia Phillies vs. St. Louis Cardinals Milwaukee Brewers vs. Arizona Diamondbacks Philadelphia vs. St. Louis Game 1 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Cardinals struck first on Lance Berkman's three-run home run off Phillies' starter Roy Halladay in the first inning. The Phillies fought back on Shane Victorino's RBI single in the fourth, and Ryan Howard put Philadelphia ahead with a second-deck three-run shot in the sixth. Two batters later, Ra√∫l Iba√±ez hit a two-run homer to give the Phillies a three-run lead. Iba√±ez's homer was the decisive blow to Cardinals' starter Kyle Lohse, who was out of the game after innings. Next inning, the Phillies loaded the bases on three singles with no outs off of Marc Rzepczynski, who was then relieved by Mitchell Boggs. After Hunter Pence hit into a force out at home, Howard's sacrifice fly followed by RBI singles by Victorino and Iba√±ez made it 9‚Äì3 Phillies. Next inning, Jimmy Rollins walked with two outs, then Chase Utley doubled before both men scored on Pence's single. In the top of the ninth, the Cardinals scored three runs on Adron Chambers' RBI single and Skip Schumaker's two-run double off reliever Michael Stutes, but closer Ryan Madson struck out Jon Jay and Matt Holliday to seal the win for the Phillies. Game 2 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Phillies scored early on RBI singles by Ryan Howard and Ra√∫l Iba√±ez in the first inning. Hunter Pence's single in the second scored Jimmy Rollins and gave the Phillies a 4‚Äì0 lead. With Cliff Lee on the mound, who was 7‚Äì2 in the postseason and 3‚Äì0 in the League Division Series, and Chris Carpenter, who pitched on three days' rest, was out after three innings, things did not look good for the Cardinals. However, the offense started to do their work in the fourth, when Ryan Theriot, Jon Jay, and Rafael Furcal each knocked in one run for the Cardinals. Jay singled again in the sixth to tie the game and Albert Pujols' RBI single in the seventh gave the Cardinals the lead. The Cardinals' bullpen picked up where Carpenter left off, combined to throw six innings of scoreless, one-hit ball. Cardinals closer Jason Motte pitched a four-out save to seal the win. This was the third consecutive postseason loss for Lee going back to the 2010 World Series. Game 3 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri After six scoreless innings from both starting pitchers, the Phillies sent Ben Francisco to pinch-hit for Cole Hamels, following an intentional walk to Carlos Ruiz, and a single by Shane Victorino. Francisco homered off the second pitch from Jaime Garc√≠a over the left center wall to give the Phillies a 3‚Äì0 lead. In the sixth inning, a squirrel‚Äîsoon to become more famous the next day under the name \\"Rally Squirrel\\"‚Äîappeared in the outfield, causing a brief interruption in play. The incident was even immortalized in a promo for the \\"Legends are Born in October\\" ad campaign, complete with the background music set to the ads from that campaign, Tinie Tempah's \\"Written in the Stars.\\"Legends are born in October ... like the Rally Squirrel In the bottom of the seventh, the Cardinals added a run with Allen Craig scoring off an RBI single by David Freese. In the bottom of the eighth, the Cardinals were able to load the bases with one out, thanks to singles by Ryan Theriot, pinch hitter Matt Holliday, and Rafael Furcal. However, the Cardinals were not able to capitalize, with Craig grounding out into an inning ending double play. In the bottom of the ninth, Pujols led off with his third double of the game. Following a flyout by Lance Berkman and a ground out by Freese (which sent Pujols to third), Yadier Molina singled to center, bringing Pujols home, and making it a one-run game. Theriot then grounded out to second to end the game, giving the Phillies a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 6:07 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri Before the second-largest crowd (47,071) in Busch Stadium history, the Cardinals staved off elimination with a 5‚Äì3 home victory over the Phillies. The Phils struck first with two runs in the first inning off Edwin Jackson. Jimmy Rollins doubled and scored on a triple by Chase Utley, who came home on Hunter Pence's single to make it 2‚Äì0. The Cards cut the lead to 2‚Äì1 in the bottom half when Lance Berkman doubled in Skip Schumaker. Berkman advanced to third when Shane Victorino misplayed the ball, but was unable to score. Meanwhile, Jackson settled down after the shaky first, allowing only two hits in the next five innings. The Cards took the lead on David Freese's two-run double in the fourth, scoring Berkman and Matt Holliday to make it 3‚Äì2, Cardinals. In the fifth inning, the Rally Squirrel again appeared, crossing home plate as Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker. The pitch was called a ball, but Oswalt and manager Charlie Manuel argued for \\"no pitch\\", which appeal was denied by home-plate umpire √Ångel Hern√°ndez. Schumaker then flied out, but the Rally Squirrel went on to become a cause c√©l√®bre in St. Louis. St. Louis extended their lead to 5‚Äì2 in the sixth when Freese hit a two-run homer to the grassy area in center field. After that, the Cards' bullpen took it the rest of the way. Arthur Rhodes pitched a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 seventh, but Fernando Salas ran into trouble in the eighth, allowing a run on a wild pitch to cut the Cardinals' lead to 5‚Äì3. The Phillies would bring the tying run to the plate in the form of St. Louis native Ryan Howard later in the inning, but Marc Rzepczynski struck out Howard to escape the jam. In the bottom half, Albert Pujols batted against Brad Lidge, a pitcher whom Pujols victimized with a three-run home run in the 2005 playoffs, when Lidge was with Houston. Lidge, however, got Pujols to fly out to right. Jason Motte got the save by retiring the Phillies in order in the ninth. Center fielder Jon Jay made a sliding catch of a line drive by former Cardinal Pl√°cido Polanco for the final out. Game 5 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Cardinals struck first in the first inning when leadoff batter Rafael Furcal hit a triple and Skip Schumaker followed with a double, but no other runs were scored with Roy Halladay laboring through over 30 pitches in that inning. In the bottom of the fourth, the Phillies had runners at the corners with two outs. On a 3‚Äì2 count, batter Ra√∫l Iba√±ez got a cutter down the middle and hit it deep to right field. The TV camera focused on the right field stands, but would move down to show Lance Berkman making the catch at the warning track. Halladay was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth after giving up six hits and one run, throwing 126 pitches, 87 for strikes. He walked one (intentional to Albert Pujols), striking out seven. Ryan Madson replaced Halladay in the ninth. Chris Carpenter got Ryan Howard to ground out to second, capping off a three-hit shutout. Howard tore his Achilles' tendon on that final play. This was only the third \\"winner-take-all\\" game in postseason history to end in a 1‚Äì0 score. (Following Game 7 of the 1962 World Series and Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.) Composite box 2011 NLDS (3‚Äì2): St. Louis Cardinals over Philadelphia Phillies Milwaukee vs. Arizona Game 1 2:07 p.m. (EDT) at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Game 1 featured both teams' top winning pitchers, with the Diamondbacks' 21-game winner Ian Kennedy going against the Brewers' 17-game winner Yovani Gallardo. The Diamondbacks threatened in the 1st inning, where Willie Bloomquist was thrown out at home by Ryan Braun on a potential RBI single by Justin Upton. After that, Gallardo settled down, pitching 8 stellar innings, tying a franchise postseason record with 9 strikeouts. The Brewers scored first in the 4th when Braun scored on a Jerry Hariston sacrifice fly, and then scored again in the 6th when Yuniesky Betancourt tripled and was then driven in by a single by Jonathan Lucroy. In the 7th inning, with two outs, Braun doubled for the Brewers, with Prince Fielder coming up. Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson went to talk to Kennedy and allowed Kennedy to pitch to Fielder with first base open. This was considered by some observers an eerie case of d√©j√† vu for Gibson, who had been in the same situation at the plate in the 1984 World Series when Goose Gossage chose to pitch to Gibson with 1st base open, and gave up a home run to Gibson. The same thing happened for Fielder, who hit the second pitch he saw from Kennedy out for a 2-run homer, giving the Brewers a comfortable 4‚Äì0 lead. Ryan Roberts broke up Gallardo's shutout with a home run in the 8th, but Brewers closer John Axford finished off the Diamondbacks in the 9th, giving the Brewers the 4‚Äì1 win and the first win of the series. Game 2 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Brewers started Game 2 on a high note with Ryan Braun hitting a two-run homer in the first inning off of Daniel Hudson, but starter Zack Greinke, pitching on three days' rest, allowed a leadoff home run to Paul Goldschmidt in the second; In the third, Braun doubled with two outs, then scored on Prince Fielder's single before Fielder scored on Rickie Weeks's triple. Greinke gave up a solo home run to Chris Young in the fourth, then a two-run home run to Justin Upton in the fifth and left with the game in a 4‚Äì4 tie. In the sixth, Jerry Hairston doubled with one out. Brad Ziegler relieved Hudson and committed a balk that let Hairston move to third, then walked Yuniesky Betancourt. Hairston scored on Jonathan Lucroy's bunt single and an error put runners on second and third. After Mark Kotsay was intentionally walked to load the bases, Corey Hart's single scored a run, Nyjer Morgan's single scored two more, and Braun's single scored another to give the Brewers a 9‚Äì4 lead. The Brewers bullpen pitched scoreless ball for the last four innings in helping the team gain a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Game 3 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona With support from the sellout crowd, the Diamondbacks' offense finally broke out in Game 3\\\\. The D-backs scored two runs in the first on Miguel Montero's RBI double and Paul Goldschmidt's RBI single, one in the third on Montero's RBI single, and five in the fifth on Goldschmidt's grand slam and Ryan Roberts' RBI single. Backed up by the offense, starter Josh Collmenter hurled seven innings, allowing two hits, one earned run, and two walks while striking out six. The only run for the Brewers came from Corey Hart's solo homer in the top of the third. With the 8‚Äì1 lead, relievers David Hernandez and J. J. Putz pitched the eighth and the ninth each to seal the win. Game 4 9:37 p.m. (EDT) at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona The Diamondbacks knocked in ten runs‚Äîeight on four homers‚Äîto force a decisive Game 5\\\\. The Brewers scored early in the first inning on Ryan Braun's RBI double. But the D-backs fought back in the bottom half on Ryan Roberts' grand slam and Chris Young's solo homer. The Brewers scored two more runs on George Kottaras' RBI groundout in the second and Jerry Hairston, Jr.'s RBI double in the third. The D-backs answered with Collin Cowgill's two-run single in the bottom of the third. Both starters were ineffective as each pitched only three innings, but the two homers allowed by Randy Wolf made the most difference, putting the Brewers into an early 7‚Äì3 hole. The Brewers continued scoring on Corey Hart's sacrifice fly in the sixth and Carlos G√≥mez's two-run homer. But the D-backs also scored three more runs on Aaron Hill's solo home run in the sixth and Young's two-run homer, his second of the night, in the seventh. Closer J. J. Putz pitched a scoreless ninth to seal the win for the D-backs. Game 5 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Diamondbacks struck first with Justin Upton's solo home run in the top of the third inning, but the Brewers immediately tied the game in the bottom of the fourth with a Jerry Hairston, Jr. sacrifice fly scoring Nyjer Morgan. The Brewers took the lead in the bottom of the sixth when Yuniesky Betancourt hit an RBI single scoring Ryan Braun. In the top of the ninth John Axford came in on a save situation, but blew it when Willie Bloomquist hit an RBI bunt single scoring Gerardo Parra. Axford was able to escape with a pair of fielder's choice outs to Upton and Henry Blanco. The game went into extra innings after David Hernandez pitched a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 ninth. In the top of the 10th Axford pitched a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 inning of his own, and then with J. J. Putz pitching in the bottom of the 10th, Morgan hit the walk-off RBI single scoring Carlos G√≥mez to give Milwaukee the victory. It was the Brewers' first playoff series win since beating the California Angels 3‚Äì2 in the 1982 ALCS, and also made the NLCS for the first time, having moved to the National League in 1998. This was only the second Game 5 of a Division Series to require extra innings, after Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, which saw the Seattle Mariners defeat the New York Yankees, courtesy of The Double.

Three divisional winners and a fourth team‚Äîa wild card‚Äîplayed in two series. TBS televised all games but the Game 2's of both series in the United States. The Game 2's of both series were aired on TNT due to schedule conflicts with other ALDS games or the NLDS. The regular season finished on September 28, with the ALDS beginning September 30. Game 5 of the Yankees‚ÄìTigers series was played on October 6. Under MLB's playoff format, no two teams from the same division were matched up in the Division Series, regardless of whether their records would normally indicate such a matchup. Home field advantage went to the team with the better regular-season record with the exception of the wild card team, which defers home field advantage regardless of record. The matchups for the 2011 ALDS were: * (1) New York Yankees (East Division champions, 97‚Äì65) vs. (3) Detroit Tigers (Central Division champions, 95‚Äì67): Tigers won the series, 3‚Äì2. * (2) Texas Rangers (West Division champions, 96‚Äì66) vs. (4) Tampa Bay Rays (Wild Card qualifier, 91‚Äì71): Rangers won the series, 3‚Äì1. This was the second consecutive playoff meeting between the Rangers and Rays; the Rangers won 3‚Äì2 in the 2010 ALDS. The Tigers and Yankees previously met in the 2006 ALDS, in which the Tigers won 3‚Äì1, the last time they reached the postseason. Participants *On September 16, the Detroit Tigers clinched the AL Central title, becoming the first team of the season to qualify for the ALDS. It was the Tigers' first AL Central title since they joined the division in 1998, the team's first division title overall since 1987, and first playoff appearance since winning the 2006 American League pennant as the Wild Card team. *On September 21, the New York Yankees clinched the AL East title, their Major League record 17th overall. *On September 23, after the Angels lost to the Athletics, the Texas Rangers clinched the AL West for the second straight year. *On September 28, after making up a 9-game deficit in the final month of the season and going into the season's last day tied with the Red Sox for the last playoff berth, the Tampa Bay Rays clinched the AL Wild Card by defeating the Yankees in extra innings while the Red Sox lost to the Orioles. Matchups New York Yankees vs. Detroit Tigers ‚Ä†: suspended in the bottom of the second inning due to rain Texas Rangers vs. Tampa Bay Rays New York vs. Detroit Game 1 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York In front of a Yankee Stadium record setting crowd of 50,940, Justin Verlander, 24-game winner, Triple Crown winner, and Cy Young Award frontrunner, started Game 1 for the Tigers against Yankees' ace CC Sabathia. The Tigers started the scoring on Delmon Young's two-out solo home run in the top of the first inning. The Yankees managed to tie the game in the bottom half without a hit. Leadoff batter Derek Jeter reached first base on a wild pitch third strike. Jeter moved to third on Curtis Granderson's walk and Robinson Can√≥'s groundout and then scored on Alex Rodriguez's RBI groundout. The game was delayed by rain in the middle of the second inning and later suspendedThe contest was suspended under MLB Rule 4.10 Comment, which states that postseason games which have started and are then called may not be declared \\"no game\\", and any activity discarded, as in Rule 4.10(e). Instead, this rule stipulates that all postseason games which are called may be considered suspended and resumed from the point of interruption at a future date, as in Rule 4.12. and resumed at 8:37 p.m. on October 1, pushing Game 2 back to October 2. The suspension significantly altered both teams' pitching rotations for the series. Doug Fister and Iv√°n Nova, both of whom were originally scheduled to start Game 2, entered as relief pitchers when Game 1 was resumed. Jorge Posada led off the continuation of the game with a single and then Russell Martin doubled, but Posada was tagged out trying to go home on a Brett Gardner grounder. The Tigers threatened in the fifth inning, putting men on first and second. However, Granderson made a strong throw to Jeter, who relayed to Martin at home to tag out Alex Avila trying to score the go-ahead run. Granderson hit a double in the bottom of the inning and Can√≥ drove him in with an RBI double that was reviewed by instant replay after the ball hit the top of the wall near the boundary line. In the next inning, the Yankees scored six runs and, after Fister was relieved, a Can√≥ grand slam, extending the Yankees lead to 8‚Äì1. Later, Can√≥ knocked in his sixth RBI on an eighth-inning double to score Jeter, tying a Yankees postseason record for RBIs in a game by a single player. The Tigers threatened in the top of ninth when Delmon Young's single, Miguel Cabrera's walk, and V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez' single loaded the bases. Nova was relieved by Luis Ayala, who surrendered an RBI groundout by Avila, an RBI single by Ryan Raburn, and a single by Jhonny Peralta to load the bases again. The Yankees turned to their closer, all-time saves leader Mariano Rivera, in a non-save situation, who struck out Wilson Betemit to end the game. Game 2 3:07 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Max Scherzer threw no-hit innings before allowing a single to Robinson Can√≥. Scherzer got help from the Tigers' offense early, as Magglio Ord√≥√±ez singled with one out in the first inning, then Miguel Cabrera hit an opposite-field home run one out later to put the Tigers in front 2‚Äì0. In the sixth, Austin Jackson reached on Derek Jeter's throwing error to first, then Ord√≥√±ez singled. After Delmon Young struck out, back-to-back RBI singles from both Cabrera and V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez made it 4-0 Tigers and knocked Freddy Garc√≠a out of the game. The Yankees got on the board in the eighth on Curtis Granderson's leadoff home run off of Joaqu√≠n Benoit, but in the ninth, Luis Ayala hit Brandon Inge with a pitch. Inge moved to second on a groundout and scored on Don Kelly's single to give the Tigers the run back. In the bottom of the inning, Nick Swisher hit a leadoff home run off Jos√© Valverde, who then allowed a triple to Jorge Posada and walked Russell Martin before Andruw Jones's sacrifice fly cut the Tigers' lead to 5‚Äì3. Jeter struck out and Granderson walked before Valverde retired Robinson Can√≥ on a groundout, sending the teams to Detroit with the series tied at a game apiece. Game 3 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan In a rematch of the Game 1 starters, the Yankees struck first off of Justin Verlander when Derek Jeter singled to lead off the first and scored on Curtis Granderson's triple. After Robinson Cano struck out, Granderson scored on Alex Rodriguez's single to make it 2‚Äì0 Yankees. In the bottom of the third, Ramon Santiago's RBI single with two on off of C.C. Sabathia scored Brandon Inge from second. A single loaded the bases before Miguel Cabrera grounded into a double play, but Austin Jackson scored to tie the game. Inge hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored again on an RBI double by Santiago in the fifth inning, giving the Tigers the lead. Don Kelly hit a leadoff single and scored on an RBI double by Jhonny Peralta in the sixth to increase Detroit's lead. After Alex Avila's sacrifice bunt, Sabathia was relieved by Rafael Soriano. In the seventh, after getting two outs, Verlander walked Jorge Posada and hit Russell Martin with a pitch before both men scored on a Brett Gardner RBI double, tying the game. In the bottom of the inning, Delmon Young's home run off of Soriano put the Tigers back in front 5‚Äì4. Jos√© Valverde recorded his 50th consecutive save in as many tries‚Äîincluding regular season‚Äîfor the Tigers win, striking out Jeter with runners on first and second, both having reached on walks, to end the game. Game 4 8:37 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan With their backs against the wall, the Yankees relied on A. J. Burnett to even the series. Burnett, who was assigned to the bullpen in the Division Series due to inconsistency, re-took the starting role thanks to the suspension in Game 1\\\\. Burnett was almost to be relieved by Cory Wade in the bottom of the first inning after issuing a two-out walk to V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez that loaded the bases, but Curtis Granderson's run-saving catch helped Burnett escape the jam unharmed. Derek Jeter's two-run double in the third put the Yankees on board, but Mart√≠nez's solo homer in the bottom of the fourth cut the Yankees' lead to one. Granderson's RBI double and Alex Rodriguez's sacrifice fly in the fifth increased the lead to three. Burnett was relieved after Don Kelly's two-out single in the bottom of the sixth, and he gave the Yankees what they were hoping for‚Äîtossing innings, allowing four hits, one earned run, and four walks while striking out three. Later, Granderson's second run-saving catch of the day ended the sixth inning for Burnett and the Yankees. The Yankees' offense erupted in the top of the eighth. Three struggling Yankees hitters‚ÄîRodriguez, Mark Teixeira, and Nick Swisher‚Äîhit consecutive singles to start the eighth inning. A balk by the Tigers' reliever Al Alburquerque and an RBI single by pinch-hitter Jes√∫s Montero brought in two more runs for the Yankees. Russell Martin was walked to load the bases again, followed by Brett Gardner's RBI single for another run. The next two batters‚ÄîDerek Jeter and Granderson‚Äîboth struck out, but Montero scored on a wild pitch by Tigers' reliever Daniel Schlereth during Granderson's at-bat. Robinson Can√≥ singled in two more runs to increase the lead to 10‚Äì1. The six-run rally was more than enough for the Yankees, as the Yankees' relievers‚ÄîRafael Soriano, Phil Hughes, and Boone Logan‚Äîheld the Tigers hitless in the remaining innings while striking out six. Game 5 8:07 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Game 5 was a rematch of the two pitchers of record in Game 1‚ÄîIv√°n Nova and Doug Fister. Despite the fans setting another Yankee Stadium record with 50,960 in attendance, the Tigers eliminated the Yankees with a 3‚Äì2 win. Back‚Äìto‚Äìback homers by Don Kelly and Delmon Young in the first inning put Detroit on top. Young's homer was his third, a Tigers record in a playoff series. Nova did not last long, as he was pulled after the second inning with forearm tightness. The Tigers made it 3‚Äì0 in the top of the fifth when V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez singled off CC Sabathia to drive in Austin Jackson. In the bottom of the fifth the Yankees finally scored on a Robinson Can√≥ solo homer, and got another run in the seventh when Mark Teixeira walked with the bases loaded to score Derek Jeter. However, Joaqu√≠n Benoit managed to strike out Nick Swisher with the bases still loaded, ending the threat. Jos√© Valverde closed the door when he struck out Alex Rodriguez in the ninth, earning his 51st straight save of the combined 2011 season and postseason. The Tigers became only the third team to beat the Yankees in consecutive post-season series meetings; previously the 1921‚Äì22 New York Giants and the 2002 and 2005 Angels were able to beat the Yankees in consecutive playoff series meetings. This was also the first time since 2007 the Yankees were eliminated at home. CC Sabathia appeared in relief for the first time in his career when he relieved Boone Logan in the fifth, in which he surrendered the winning run. Mariano Rivera made what would be his final postseason appearance, pitching a scoreless ninth.http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/playbyplay?gameId=311006110&teams;=detroit- tigers-vs-new-york-yankees Composite box 2011 ALDS (3‚Äì2): Detroit Tigers over New York Yankees Texas vs. Tampa Bay Game 1 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas Rookie Matt Moore started Game 1 for the Rays, his second Major League start and fourth appearance since his September 12 promotion from Triple-A. Moore gave the Rays seven shutout innings‚Äîallowing two hits and two walks while striking out six. After pitching a perfect first, C. J. Wilson hit Ben Zobrist with a pitch leading off the second, then Johnny Damon's home run put Tampa up 2‚àí0. Kelly Shoppach then singled, moved to second on a ground out, and scored on Matt Joyce's single. Shoppach's three- run home run after two singles next inning made it 6‚àí0 Tampa. In the fifth, Adri√°n Beltr√©'s throwing error to first allowed Damon to reach base, then Shoppach's second home run of the game made it 8‚àí0 Tampa. They added one more run in the ninth on Damon's single with runners on second and third off of Mike Gonzalez. Wade Davis retired the Rangers in order in the bottom half to preserve the shutout. Game 2 7:07 p.m. (EDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas The Rays struck first on Kelly Shoppach's bases-loaded walk in the first inning and Matt Joyce's two-run home run in the fourth. However, Rays starter James Shields ran into trouble in the bottom of the fourth. After Elvis Andrus' hit-by-pitch and consecutive singles by Josh Hamilton and Michael Young loaded the bases, Shields again hit Adri√°n Beltr√© and surrendered a two-run single to Mike Napoli. The next two batters, Nelson Cruz and David Murphy, both struck out, but Murphy reached first base on an uncaught third strike thanks to a wild pitch earlier to advance the runners. Beltr√© also scored on that play. Mitch Moreland followed up with an RBI groundout to score Napoli. The five-run fourth gave the Rangers a 5‚Äì3 lead over the Rays. Rangers starter Derek Holland put another zero on the scoreboard before handing the game to the bullpen. The Rangers continued to score on Ian Kinsler's two-run double in the sixth. Evan Longoria came up with a three-run homer in the seventh to bring the Rays within a run. Moreland answered with a solo homer in the eighth to increase the lead to two. Neftal√≠ Feliz pitched a scoreless ninth to record the save. As of the 2020 postseason, this is the only ALDS game the Rangers have won at home, and with the Rangers moving to Globe Life Field in 2020, the only ALDS game the Rangers won at Globe Life Park. Game 3 5:07 p.m. (EDT) at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida A Desmond Jennings home run in the fourth gave the Rays an early lead. David Price, winless against the Rangers in his Major League career, held Texas without a run for six innings before giving up a Mike Napoli two-run homer after Adri√°n Beltr√© singled. Josh Hamilton later hit a two-RBI single off reliever J. P. Howell to put Texas ahead 4‚Äì1. Later, in the bottom half, Sean Rodriguez hit an RBI groundout to score Johnny Damon and cut Texas's lead to two. In the bottom of the eighth, Jennings cut the deficit to one on his second solo home run of the game; however, the Rays' comeback attempt was put to rest on a double play grounder by Kelly Shoppach in the ninth. Game 4 2:07 p.m. (EDT) at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida The Rangers struck first with an Ian Kinsler home run off Rays' starter Jeremy Hellickson in the first inning. Three homers by Adri√°n Beltr√© off Hellickson in the second and fourth, and off Matt Moore in the seventh gave Texas the much-needed cushion. The Rays tried to come back when Matt Joyce doubled in the second and scored Sean Rodriguez in a plate collision with Mike Napoli. Later Rodriguez also scored in the fourth and ninth off Casey Kotchman RBI singles, but the game ended after Joyce popped out in foul territory to Beltr√© and Desmond Jennings grounded into a force out. Beltr√© became the sixth player in MLB history to hit three home runs in a single postseason game, joining Babe Ruth (1926 and 1928 World Series), Bob Robertson (1971 NLCS), Reggie Jackson (1977 World Series), George Brett (1978 ALCS), and Adam Kennedy (2002 ALCS). With the win, the Rangers advanced to their second straight ALCS. This also marked the Rangers' fifth straight postseason win at Tropicana Field.

As one of the requirements for becoming an attorney, he completed his court practicum year at the regional court at Krems an der Donau. Political career In Vorarlberg state From 1985 to 1996 Ewald Stadler was a member of the municipal council (Gemeinderat) in M√§der and a member of its Gemeindevorstand (an elected subgroup of the Gemeinderat) from 1990 to 1994. As early as 1989 he was elected to the Landtag (provincial assembly) of Vorarlberg, in which he remained until 1994. In addition, from 1991 to 1994 Stadler was head of the Landtag caucus of the Vorarlberg Freedom Party (FP√ñ). Also, while he was active in Vorarlberg provincial politics, he held the role of a member of the Vorarlberg FP√ñ Provincial Party Committee.

He won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for White Shadows in the South Seas presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1930 at its 2nd Academy Awards show.  Career  De Vinna was cinematographer on over 120 film and television projects from 1916 through 1953. He graduated from the University of Arkansas and began his career began when he joined Inceville studios in 1915 as First Cameraman. In 1916, he shot The Raiders, the first film to be shot at what was to become MGM. He was also an avid ham radio enthusiast, serving as an army radio operator, and carrying a portable transmitter with him on all location shoots. While shooting Trader Horn (1931) on location in Kenya, he seconded as the project's ham radio operator, keeping the production crew in the African bush in contact with its base camp in Nairobi. When on location in Alaska for 11 months for the filming of Eskimo (1933), he kept the production company in contact with its base. While working in a small shack made air-tight against the cold, De Vinna was in short wave contact with a ham operator in New Zealand, and was overcome by carbon monoxide fumes emitted by his gasoline heater. When De Vinna's keystrokes faltered, the ham in New Zealand realized something was wrong, and put out a call for help to a ham in Hawaii, who in turn relayed the message to a ham in Alaska, which led to De Vinna receiving the necessary emergency aid. De Vinna's life as a cameraman, world traveler, and adventurer was captured in the 1939 Pete Smith MGM short film Radio Hams, written by Buddy Adler and directed by Felix E. Feist, with actor Alonzo Price starring as Clyde De Vinna. De Vinna was also accomplished in aerial cinematography.

History   School of Doctor for Medical Preparation  In reign of King Vajiravudh (Ranam VI), Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath gave his though about establishing the pharmacy school in Siam to Prince Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Royal Medical College inspector, and he also agreed. Prince Rangsit Prayurasakdi wrote the note entitled \\"Doctor for compounding medicine practice opinion \\" on October 5, 1913. After that, Ministry of Dhammakan announced \\"the regulation of Doctor for Compouding Medicine Students\\" on December 8, 1913. This date has become an officially established date for this school and also pharmacy professional in Siam. The school of doctor for compounding medicine was classified as a department in Royal Medical College. The school was begun the academic on June 2, 1914 for the first time with 4 students. The certificate for the graduated students was \\"Certificate of Medicine Compouder\\". Then, King Vajiravudh founded Chulalongkorn University which gathered 4 independent colleges in Siam became 4 faculties under the university administration. The school of doctor for compounding medicine, as a department of Royal Medical College, changed to Department of Doctor for Compounding Medicine under Faculty of Medicine. The School used two places for education, Windsor Palace and Siriraj Hospital. Later, Thai Pdanukornam (Thai Lexicon) announced to use \\"Pharmacy\\" (‡πÄ‡∏†‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°) instead of \\"Doctor for Compouding Medicine\\" (‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡∏¢‡∏≤). So, the school was changed the name to \\"Department of Pharmacy\\" under the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital. Later, House of representatives enacted the Chulalongkorn University Act B.E. 2477 which moved the School of Pharmacy from Faculty of Medicine to an independent department, and changded a degree name to \\"Certificate in Pharmacy (C.P.)\\". However, the Dean of Faculty of Medicine in charged as a department principal. In 1936, the academic degree for pharmacy was upgraded to \\"Diploma in Pharmacy\\", studying period was 3 years. Although this new curriculum gathered the new innovation and modern in pharmacy, but it was still an uninteresting field of studying in that time. Until Tua Lapanukrom, director of sciences department, was appointed to be a department principal. He improved the school administration and asked the university council for school's own budget. In his era, the government approved school building construction project, located inside Chulalongkorn University, connected to Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Architectures.  Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medical Sciences  In 1943, the government reformed management in country and established University of Medical Sciences (currently named Mahidol University), compose of 4 health sciences faculties which separated from Chulalongkorn University. Department of Pharmacy, Chulalongkorn University became \\"the faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medical Sciences\\". Although the new university has been established, but the education in all faculties still using the area in Chulalongkorn University, excepted the faculty of Medicine that educating in Siriraj Hospital. In 1957, the faculty upgraded the certificate to Bachelor in Pharmacy which spending 5 years in curriculum. The additional year is practicing year for the students in hospital, retail pharmacy, manufacturing company and the other field of pharmacy. Especially in 1906, Thai social concerned the roll of pharmacist as part of allied professional health team, the faculty added some clinical pharmacy courses to response their need. On August 22, 1962, Thai Ministry of Education sent the letter to the university's rector to expand the student number in Pharmacy field. By the limited of the faculty expanding the building which located in Chulalongkorn University area, the university decided to establish the new pharmacy faculty. In 1968, the royal decree announced the establishment of the new pharmacy faculty called \\"Phayathai Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medical Sciences\\", made that time there are two pharmacy faculties in the university. Later, King Bhumibol Adulyadej declared the name of the university to be changed to Mahidol University in 1969. Therefore, the faculty had been renamed to \\"Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University\\" which still located in Chulalongkorn University area.  Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University  In 1972, the revolutionary council announced changing the status of the faculty affiliated to Chulalongkorn University and renamed the faculty to \\"Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University\\". This made Mahidol University has the only pharmacy faculty left in university, thus Thai University Bureau approved changing name of \\"Phayathai Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University\\" to \\"Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University\\" (which cut \\"Phayathai\\" from its name). With the limited problem in expanding the faculty, Chulalongkorn University initiated the \\"Medical Square\\" project near Siam Square area, featuring 3 faculties: dentistry, veterinarian and pharmacy.

Kanetake's great- grandfather Kanekata formed a branch family from his main one and lived in Jokamachi as a stipended lower-ranked retainer. Kanekata died during the Tenmei era (1781). Kanetake's grandfather Kaneoki died in 1811 and when Kanetake was born (1823), Kanekiyo his father was still a low stipended bushi living in a modest house below Kagoshima Castle. Also, according to the biography (see below) he became a relative of the famous Kirino Toshiaki, a Brigadier in the Imperial Army that took Aizuwakamatsu Castle from Matsudaira Katamori in 1868 in the Battle of Aizu. Kirano later died with Saig≈ç Takamori in the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion. Career Kanetake was the Satsuma han's astronomer and through his treatises he came to the notice of Shimazu Narioki and Nariakira. At the age of 26 in 1849, he journeyed to Edo to study military science and Confucianism under Ohashi Tostuan and Fujimori Kouan at their academy. Later he journeyed to the T≈çhoku region in 1850 and when he returned to Edo, he became acquainted with Yoshida Sh≈çin, who was very interested to hear from Kanetake the conditions of the north.

The next day, Yoshida's associates, Toriyama, Miyabe, and Ebata, left for Tohoku as well. Kanetake was furious and allegedly thrashed about with his sword inside Sengaku-ji, but probably did not hurt anyone. Later he heard that Yoshida never made it over the strait to Ezo and never spoke to Yoshida again. He was friendly with Saito Shintaro of the Ch≈çsh≈´ han who was renowned as a great swordsman. Around 1869‚Äì70, Kanetake worked in the Resource Office of Hokkaido and later helped open the Teacher's College in Yamagata. He retired in May 1888 and died on 23 December 1888 at age 65. Commentary According to the sayagaki on Kanetake's sword, Tanobe Michihiro Sensei states that \\"Kanetake was a senior retainer of the Shimazu family\\" and was duly a trusted retainer during the three reigns of Shimazu Nariakira, the regent Shimazu Hisamitsu, and for the 29th and final lord, Shimazu Tadayoshi (2nd). Kanetake's journal Tohoku Fudan describes his residence of Sakurajima, Kagoshima and gives a detailed account of his travels through Ezo, Matsumae, Tsugaru, Sendai, Nihonmatsu, Sadoshima, Kaga and thence back to Kagoshima. Given the time period (1854), it is not surprising that Nariakira wished for a detailed report on the defense and social conditions in the northern domains and so sent Kanetake to gather a meaningful report. Destinations Here is a list of where Kanetake visited: # Ezo Matsumae # Tsugaru # Nanbu # Date,Sendai # Nihonmatsu, Niwa # Aizu-Matsudaira # Sakura, Awa # Izu # Satake-shi # Sakai- shi, Tsuruoka # Uesugi, Yonezawa # Sado # Echigo # Kaga-Maeda # Echizen-Fukui, Matsudaira Legacy Kanetake had a son, Kimotsuki Kaneyuki ËÇù‰ªòÂÖºË°å (1853‚Äì1922) later Vice Admiral, and later elevated to the peerage as Baron Kimotsuki in 1907. He was principal of the Naval Academy in 1904-05 and later served a term as Mayor of Osaka. A sayagaki has been affixed by the well-known sword scholar, Tanobe Michihiro, which attests to the authenticity of the sword and the credentials of Kimotsuki Kanetake. By coincidence, Tanobe Michihiro was born in Kimotsuki district (now Aira-gun), from which the Kimotsuki family took its name, and is well versed in the Kimotsuki family history as his family in former times served the Shimazu family, up until the Restoration. Background The Kimotsuki family of ≈åsumi Province were an ancient family descended from Prince ≈åtomo, the favourite son of Emperor Tenji who later succeeded his father as Emperor K≈çbun and they are first mentioned in the early Heian period. They were the leading family of Osumi Province and clashed off and on with their neighbours the Shimazu family despite being closely related through intermarriage with them for several hundreds of years. Finally in 1566, Lord Kimotsuki Kanetsugu died after his defeat by the Shimazu. In January 1581, due to internal opposition from retainers and his mother, who was the eldest sister of Shimazu Takahisa, his third son, Kimotsuki Kaneaki surrendered the Kimotsuki lands and for the first time in over 500 years lost their independence and became senior retainers and councilors for the Shimazu family. Because of their seniority and long residence in Osumi; they were older than the Shimazu by 200 years. The founder of the Shimazu family was the offspring of Minamoto no Yoritomo and the daughter of Hiki Yoshikazu; they retained a certain degree of independence despite being once a leading family against the Shimazu. Indeed, a valiant descendant, one Kimotsuki Kanemori 19th head, fell at Sekigahara in 1600. In recognition of their valiant service to the Shimazu, a cadet branch of the Kimotsuki, were granted a small fief in Satsuma Province. They became known as Kiire Kimotsuki, and were granted 5500 koku by the Shimazu lord. This was unique as this were one of the seven vassal family amongst the chief retainers of the Shimazu that was allowed this degree of autonomy within the Shimazu fief of 770,000 koku.

The popular names refer to the scent of the essential oils extracted from glandular tissue, not the flowers, which have hardly any scent to speak of. Some of the species are known as kusmalva (meaning, roughly, \\"coastal geranium\\") in Afrikaans. It is in the subgenus Pelargonium along with Pelargonium graveolens, Pelargonium tomentosum and Pelargonium crispum. Etymology Pelargonium comes from the Greek pelargos, which means stork. Another name for pelargoniums is storksbills due to the shape of their fruit. The epithet capitatum refers to the head-shaped flowers leaves. Description Pelargonium capitatum is a low shrub up to about 100 cm (39 in) in height and 1.5 m across. The stems are soft and coated in green, glandular hairs. Brushing against a bush releases a copious scent of the essential oil from damaged hairs. The scent varies from faint sweetness to a strong rosy scent. The flowers range from white through various shades of pink to purple. Its preferred habitat is on sand dunes, but it is a fast grower on any reasonable base, including hard clayey soil, so it readily colonises disturbed habitat. Pelargonium capitatum is one of a number of related plants that have become a major problem in coastal regions of southwest Western Australia, where it invades banksia woodland and coastal heathland. It can be easily propagated from seed or cuttings, and grows best in well-drained sandy soils. Distribution It is found in fynbos along the coast of South Africa, from Lamberts Bay in the Western Cape east to Kwazulu-Natal. Its habitat is usually beach sand or other well-drained sandy soils. It is a popular and convenient ornamental plant and it also is one of the species of Pelargonium cultivated as a source of essential oils. Cultivars and hybrids There are many cultivars and hybrids of Pelargonium capitatum as it hybridises readily with other species in the Pelargonium subgenus. These cultivars and hybrids include: * Pelargonium 'Atomic Snowflake' - A lemony rose scented variety with creamy variegated edges * Pelargonium 'Attar of Roses' - Perhaps the most well known of pelargonium cultivars, P. 'Attar of Roses' has a sweet rose/elderflower scent. * Pelargonium 'Pink Capitatum' - A common variety of P. capitatum. It has sweet rose/lemon/elderflower scented leaves. * Pelargonium 'Rober's Lemon Rose' - A lemon scented cultivar of P. capitatum. Possibly a hybrid between P. capitatum and P. √ó limoneum. * Pelargonium 'Round-Leaf Rose' - A Reddish-Pink flowered variety of P. capitatum with rose scented leaves. * Pelargonium √ó asperum - A rose scented hybrid between P. capitatum and Pelargonium radens. This hybrid is the most commonly used pelargonium in the perfume industry. Not to be confused with the sweet scented species Pelargonium asperum.

While at Kentucky State, Clarke was a very active student, participating in sports, Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and the school's newspaper, The Kentucky Thorobred. Clarke graduated from Kentucky State College in 1941, earning a bachelor's degree in both sociology and economics. World War II After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Clarke decided to join the military. In 1942 Clarke trained with the United States Army Fifth Service Command's Signal Corps School in Cincinnati, Ohio. After receiving her training, Anna Mac officially joined the WAAC in Cincinnati on October 3. She went by train to the First Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Training Center at Fort Des Moines, Iowa ‚Äì the largest WAAC training center for African-Americans. The WAAC Basic and Officer Candidate course were identical to the corresponding courses for men, though women were not expected to study combat subjects and they took a course on women's hygiene. The women studied military sanitation and first aid, military customs and courtesy, map reading, defense against chemical attack, defense against air attack, interior guard, company administration, supply, and management of food. Clarke completed her four-week Basic Training course just prior to Christmas 1942. Military career On November 30, 1942, the Officer Candidate School at Fort Des Moines in Iowa ‚Äìwhere Clarke was stationed‚Äîwas desegregated. Within two weeks of the desegregation, Clarke became a candidate in the 15th Officer Class, WAAC OCS Program.

This assignment lasted for only a month, and in June 1943, Clarke worked in the Classification and Assignment Department of WAAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. She enrolled in the Adjutant General's School at Fort Meade, Maryland, and after having completed the training she was assigned to Chicago's WAAC recruiting program. Clarke was promoted to Second Officer on July 16, 1943, and she returned to Fort Des Moines. The Army transformed the auxiliary units of WAAC into the Regular Army, and Clarke became a member of the Women's Army Corps (WAC) in September 1943. On February 7, 1944, Clarke led the first WAC unit onto the base at Douglas Army Air Field. Located in eastern Arizona, this Army Air Field was one of only four in the U.S. to have both African-American soldiers and WACs. The theater on the post was segregated, and Clarke had been warned by the African-American soldiers not to go. However, Clarke and several women went to the theater, refusing to sit in the Colored section. She protested the enforced segregation to the theater management, her immediate supervisor and then the Commanding Officer, Colonel Harvey E. Dyer. On February 21, 1944, Colonel Dyer issued the order to his officers \\"to educate properly all enlisted and civilian personnel in your respective departments to accept any colored WACs assigned as you would any white enlisted man or enlisted woman in the Army of the United States.

Life He was born in Cairn, Perthshire 10 December 1758,http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf the son of a farmer, and nephew of John Barclay, who established the Berean Church. He was educated at Muthill parish school. Barclay initially studied divinity at the University of St Andrews, and served as a minister. Then working as a family tutor, he educated himself in biological topics and anatomy. Pupils of his entered the University of Edinburgh in 1789, and Barclay became an assistant there to John Bell the anatomist, and was also associated with his brother Charles Bell. His employer Sir James Campbell financed the completion of his medical course. Barclay qualified M.D. at Edinburgh, before studying anatomy under Andrew Marshall for a year in London. He returned to Edinburgh and established himself as an anatomical lecturer in 1797. Until 1825 he delivered two complete courses of human anatomy, a morning and an evening one, every winter session, and for several years before his death gave a summer course on comparative anatomy. His classes gradually grew in reputation; in 1804 he was formally recognised as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, and in 1806 he became a fellow of the Edinburgh College of Physicians. When a new chair of comparative anatomy for the University of Edinburgh was proposed in 1816, Barclay was the leading candidate. However, the proposal was defeated by the concerted opposition of a number of the incumbent medical professors, led by John Hope, Robert Jameson and Alexander Monro, tertius, who feared the new chair would encroach on their own prerogatives. This episode provided the subject of a memorable caricature by John Kay. Satirical etching by John Kay: Barclay attempts unsuccessfully to enter the University of Edinburgh as its new professor of comparative anatomy astride an elephant skeleton, opposed by the incumbent medical professors. Barclay supported his former pupil William Dick when he established his Dick Veterinary School. For the final two years of his life Barclay was too ill to teach, during which his classes were carried on by Robert Knox, another former pupil. He died at Argyll Square in Edinburgh on 21 August 1826, and was buried in Restalrig Churchyard on the east side of the city. Works Barclay contributed the article Physiology to the third edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1797). He developed ideas for a nomenclature of human anatomy based on scientific principles in A New Anatomical Nomenclature (1803). In 1808 he published a treatise on The Muscular Motions of the Human Body, arranged according to regions and systems, and with applications to surgery. This was followed in 1812 by his Description of the Arteries of the Human Body, the result of original study and dissection. A second edition appeared in 1820. He furnished descriptive matter to a series of plates illustrating the human skeleton and the skeletons of some animals, engraved by Edward Mitchell of Edinburgh in 1819‚Äì20. Several of his lectures on anatomy were published posthumously in 1827. Another work was An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modern, concerning Life and Organisation, published in 1822. In this work Barclay gives a spirited defense of vitalism against a catalogue of thinkers he considered to be advocates of materialistic theories of life, including Erasmus Darwin, William Lawrence and Jean-Baptiste Fray. The noted Scottish zoologist and geologist John Fleming wrote that Concerning Life and Organization \\"should be perused with care by every student of Anatomy and Natural History, as an effective preservative against the doctrines of Materialism\\". He wrote Remarks on Mr. John Bell's Anatomy of the heart & arteries under the name \\"Jonathan Dawplucker, Esq.\\" Family Barclay married Eleanora, daughter of his former employer Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, in 1811. Legacy Barclay gave his large collection of specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1821, under the condition that a suitable hall be built to display all the materials together, associated with his name. In 1828 his collection became the Barcleian Museum. It can now be seen at Surgeons' Hall.

It is a white mushroom originally described from Texas but today found in nine states of North America. It was named after Harry Delbert Thiers. The cap of this small mushroom is white and convex, measuring and covered by volval remnants. It is sticky to the touch when wet. The gills are variable in length and number and are densely packed in some specimens and widely spaced in others. They are not attached to the stipe, which is long and about thick, with a white ring. The spores measure 7.8‚Äì9.8 by 7.3‚Äì9.0 ¬µm and are roughly spherical in shape. The spore print is white. The mushroom grows in lawns, pastures and prairies. It is a saprotroph, living on decaying plant material, and not mycorrhizal as is the case with Amanita species. Previously it was placed in Amanita, but in 2016 the saprophytic members of that genus were separated off into the new genus Saproamanita by one research group, though this split is controversial. Fruit bodies appear during July and August, either in isolation or in groups, and often form fairy rings. The genome of S. thiersii is being sequenced as part of the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute Community Sequencing Program. It is hoped that this will provide a better understanding of the cellulose decomposition capabilities of the fungus. The toxicity of S. thiersii has been suspect, but reportedly it is eaten in Mexico and harvested under the Spanish name \\"hongos de neblina\\". Taxonomy Sapromanita thiersii was first described in 1957 by Harry Delbert Thiers, an American mycologist, who had spotted it on a campus lawn when he was a student. He named it Amanita alba but that name was disallowed as it had already been used for another species. In 1969 it was renamed by the Dutch mycologist Cornelis Bas as Amanita thiersii in honour of its finder. It used to be placed in the genus Amanita in the section Lepidella and subsection Vittadiniae. Bas created the stirps (an informal ranking below species level) Thiersii, in which he placed S. thiersii along with A. albofloccosa, A. aureofloccosa, A. foetens and A. praeclara. The mushroom is commonly called \\"Thiers' lepidella\\". Then in 2016 Scott Redhead and his associates created the genus Saproamanita for the saprophytic members of Amanita (sensu largo) but the new name Saproamanita thiersii is very controversial and not broadly accepted. Description Stipe and cap of the mushroom The cap is white and dry, measuring wide, and convex in shape (conico- or plano-convex). It often has a broad low umbo. The cap's flesh may be thick. At first the cap is covered by the soft, white fragmentary remains of the universal veil, which become more widely separated as the cap expands. They are shaggy and somewhat sticky. The gills are of varying lengths. They are free from the stipe and vary from crowded to widely spaced. They may be narrow or broad and are white to creamy yellow in color. The stipe is white and is long and wide. In some specimens, the stipe bruises to a yellow color. It is either hollow or lightly stuffed with a cottony tissue. The bulb at the base is slightly broader than the rest of the stipe. The bulb is long and wide. A shaggy, drooping ring is present which is often shed before maturity. Spores of S. thiersii are white and roughly spherical. They measure approximately 7.8 ‚Äì 9.8 by 7.3 ‚Äì 9.0 ¬µm and are amyloid. In an analysis, both monokaryotic (one nucleus per cell) and dikaryotic (two nuclei per cell) strains were isolated from fruit bodies. All the spores were found to be binucleate but the researchers believed that in the monokaryotic strain, the second nucleus had failed to pass through the germ tube. The odor of this mushroom is indistinct but with age can become unpleasant, like that of decay or cheese. The fungus is said to taste oily bitter or bitter metallic. Identification S. thiersii may be gathered inadvertently and thought to be edible due to the fact that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain. It is similar in appearance to a number of Amanita species. It can be distinguished from A. praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between the cells in S. thiersii. Both S. thiersii and A. aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A. silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance. Toxicity The species is suspected of being toxic as is the case in most of its close relatives. Handling the mushroom is harmless; poisoning occurs only on ingestion. A case of poisoning that may have been caused by S. thiersii has been reported from the state of Puebla, Mexico. The outcome of this case is unknown. Symptoms of poisoning in humans include reversible impairment of kidney function. A Meixner test revealed that amatoxins were not involved in the Puebla case. Ecology and habitat A specimen of S. thiersii Saproamanita thiersii inhabits lawns, pastures and prairies throughout the Mississippi River Basin. It often forms fairy rings or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. It has been found growing in the same lawn as Chlorophyllum molybdites. Analysis using stable carbon isotopes has proved that this mushroom is saprotrophic in nature, unlike the other mycorrhizal Amanitas. The fruit bodies of S. thiersii grow during the mid or late summer until early fall. Since it was first reported in 1952 in Texas, this species has been expanding its range. It appeared in southern Illinois in the 1990s and has since spread to central Illinois, where it is the most common mushroom found in lawns during July and August. Today it occurs in nine states including Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas and Illinois. It also occurs in Mexico. Genome project The main source from which S. thiersii derives its carbon is the cellulose of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In an attempt to identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to compare it with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope to better understand the genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S. thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships. This research has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the genus Amanita. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S. thiersii) has few derived characteristics. This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage in the evolution of the genus.

Probably educated at Cambridge and then overseas, he held the degree of Doctor of Laws and his first career was as a canon lawyer in Avignon, which was then the seat of the Papacy. He is credited as the first identifiable reporter of cases in the papal court known as the Rota. As Fastolf advanced in the service of the Avignon popes, he gained a series of preferments in the British Isles, concluding with the bishopric of St David's. Early life Fastolf was one of three sons of Thomas Fastolf, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, who all became lawyers. His brothers were Nicholas (died 1330), ancestor of Sir John Fastolf, generally believed to have inspired Shakespeare‚Äôs character of Sir John Falstaff, and Lawrence. His mentor was William Bateman, bishop of Norwich, and he was probably an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, as others were who came under Bateman's protection, but his studies were continued overseas, and it is not known where he took his degree of Doctor of Laws. His brother Nicholas became a serjeant-at-law and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, while his brother Lawrence was auditor of the audience court of Canterbury.J. H. Baker, 'Fastolf [Falstoli], Thomas (d. 1361), canon lawyer and bishop of St David's' , in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004), online edition accessed 5 December 2010 Career By 1326, Fastolf was a clerk of Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (d. 1335), and by about 1335 he was a papal judge at Avignon, with a seat in the rota. He became an auditor of the apostolic palace before 1340, probably during the life of his patron Bateman, who had great influence at the Avignon curia. In 1340 he and Robert de Tresk were appointed the proctors at Avignon of John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury.Roy Martin Haines, Archbishop John Stratford, Political Revolutionary and Champion of the Liberties of the English Church, ca. 1275/80-1348 (1986), p. 117 St David's Cathedral Fastolf gained various preferments at home as rewards for his services. In 1326 he was appointed prebendary of York and archdeacon of Coventry and later gained several other prebends. From 1340 to 1347 he was archdeacon of Norwich, and from 1347 to 1352 archdeacon of Wells. Although common lawyers had begun reporting cases in England during the 1260s, Fastolf is credited as the first who can be identified as reporting cases in the Rota. In the tradition of common law, Fastolf wrote a series of reports on thirty-six cases heard at the Rota in Avignon between December 1336 and February 1337, constituting a journal of the debates among the first grade auditors over some two and a half months, the Decisiones rotae.John Hamilton Baker, Monuments of endlesse labours: English canonists and their work (1998), p. 22 This work by Fastolf was published in Rome in 1475 under the name of Thomas Falstoli, providing a model for the reporting of secular cases in Italy and France, so that reports of cases became a feature of the European jus commune until the time of Napoleon. In 1352 Fastolf's services in Avignon were rewarded with the bishopric of St David's. He resigned his seat in the rota, the English presence there being continued by Simon Sudbury. He received the spiritualities of St David's on 29 March 1353 and the temporalities of the diocese on 4 June.George William Manby, The history and antiquities of the parish of Saint David, South-Wales (1801), p. 143 As Bishop of St David's for nine years, Fastolf appears to have presided over a period of quiet order, with no major new projects undertaken. A historian of the bishop's palace at St David's writes: In 1358, Fastolf made a statute, later confirmed by Richard II, to make it easier and safer for the prebendaries of his diocese to collect their share of the tithes.Edward Yardley, Francis Green, Menevia sacra (Cambrian Archaeological Association, 1927): \\"We have a Statute remaining of Bishop Thomas Fastolf, made 1358, & confirmed by King Rich. II, to enable ye Prebendaries severally to gather their share of ye Tythes with ye more ease & safety.\\" Fastolf made a will on 9 June 1361 and died before the end of June. As he had requested in his Will, which was proved on 1 July 1361, his body was entombed \\"at the right hand of the image of the Blessed Mary, in her Chapel\\", in St David's Cathedral. He left all his possessions to be disposed of by David Ley, precentor of St David's, Robert of Grymeston of the church of Dyserth, and Phillip Dyer, rector of Llanychllwydog.

Beattie, Angelus pacis: the legation of Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1326-1334 (2006), p. 41 He was thus a member of the Monterotondo branch of the Orsini family.Beattie, op. cit., p. 139 Born about 1285, he was given exactly the same name as his father's brother, Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, better known as Pope Nicholas III, who had died in 1280.ORSINI, Giovanni Gaetano (ca. 1285-1335) at fiu.edu, accessed 5 December 2010ORSINI, Giovanni Gaetano (ca. 1210/1220-1280) at fiu.edu, accessed 5 December 2010 He was enrolled at the University of Padua from 1308 to 1310 and studied letters, including rhetoric. He seems not to have made a study of law formally, but he had a wide knowledge of it, while he had very little of theology. He was already a canon of Reims Cathedral before 1308. Career By 1316 Orsini was at the papal palace in Avignon serving his cousin Cardinal Napoleone Orsini, through whose offices in September 1316 he was appointed archdeacon of Bibiesca, Burgos, and a protonotary apostolic. In the consistory of 17 December 1316 he was created cardinal deacon of San Teodoro and in 1317 received the title of San Marco in commendam. From 1326 to 1334 Orsini was Pope John XXII's legate a latere in Italy, with particular faculties over the provinces of Romagna, Tuscany, Sardinia, and Marca Umbria, which were troubled by civil wars, and was given the task of pacifying them. John chose Orsini as his legate, seeing him as an Italian prince who could find his way through the maze of Italian politics as no Gaul could hope to do. However, the people of Italy saw Orsini not as an Italian but as a Roman, and very specifically as a prince of the Orsini family.Beattie, op. cit., p. 195 The interests of the Pope were more scholarly than political, and he entrusted many practical decisions to Orsini.Christopher Kleinhenz, Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, vol. 1 (2004), p. 588 At the end of 1327, an embassy from Rome to Avignon offered the Pope a stark ultimatum: if he did not immediately return to the city, Rome would submit to his opponent Ludwig of Bavaria. The Pope declined to be commanded, and Orsini attempted to enter Rome but was turned away, retaliating by placing an interdict on the city. In January 1328 Ludwig was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome and installed as Antipope Nicholas V.Anthony Kimber Cassell, The Monarchia controversy: an historical study with accompanying translations (2004), p. 35 However, Ludwig was almost entirely dependent in Rome on Sciarra Colonna and lacked the support of Stefano Colonna the Younger. In the summer of 1328, his remaining support melted away when Robert, King of Naples, sent a fleet to blockade the port of Ostia, while Orsini massed forces outside the city. Ludwig and his antipope fled the city on 4 August, and Orsini entered it triumphantly on Sunday, 8 August. Ten days later an Angevin army led by William, Count of Eboli, marched into Rome in the name of Robert of Naples.Beattie, op. cit., pp. 117-118 Late in 1328, Orsini began a campaign against Corneto and Viterbo, which were harbouring the antipope. Both cities submitted to papal authority in 1329. The same year, the antipope also surrendered himself to the Pope, while Ludwig remained as a powerful enemy of the Pope in his Empire to the north. As Orsini's power increased, he expanded the influence of his family in Rome and also pursued a policy of aggrandizing the Roman commune itself in the region. In the later months of 1329 and early 1330, the militia of Rome raided the towns of the Campagne and Maritime Province to extract new taxes from them. When the Pope heard of this, he wrote to Orsini ordering him to stop the practice, but it continued. Two months later the Pope had to write again, this time addressing Orsini as Captain of the City (capitaneatum Urbis). By the early 1330s Orsini had assumed signorile power in Rome. The Pope also disapproved of Orsini's hostilities against the Colonna family. Eventually, Pope John ordered Orsini back to Tuscany, and in 1332 Stefano Colonna the Younger was appointed as the \\"vicar in Rome\\" of Robert of Naples, continuing to lead the Colonna war against the Orsini.Ronald G. Musto, Apocalypse in Rome: Cola di Rienzo and the politics of the New Age (University of California Press, 2003), p. 152 In August 1334, the Pope cancelled Orsini's legation. Orsini returned to Avignon, where he remained until his death a year later. Following the death of Pope John XXII on 4 December 1334, Orsini took part in the conclave which elected Pope Benedict XII.Conclave of October 21 - 22, 1303 at fiu.edu, accessed 5 December 2010 He died on 27 August 1335 at Avignon and was entombed there in the church of the Franciscans. Likeness In his Will, Orsini left money for the saying of Masses in the Chapel of St Blaise in Old St Peter's Basilica, Rome. A sculpture of a pope with a cardinal kneeling at his feet, which is thought to have been moved from St Blaise's chapel to the crypt of St Peter's in 1623, is supposed to represent Pope Nicholas III and his nephew Orsini, but this is uncertain.H.

Nelson Rose (born May 23, 1950) is an internationally known author and public speaker, and is recognized as one of the world's leading experts on gambling and gaming law.\\"I. Nelson Rose, the country's leading authority on gambling law...\\" Natasha Dow Sch√ºll, Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas at p.94 (Princeton University Press: 2012).Pokernewsdaily.com: Gambling Law Expert Nelson Rose Comments on Online Poker SeizureLive Casino Direct: Come on Down, Nelson RoseNew York Times: Who Pays Up If Online Gambling Is Illegal? (Aug. 21, 1998) He is currently a Professor Emeritus at Whittier College and a Visiting Professor at the University of Macau. Rose is best known for his internationally syndicated column and 1986 book, Gambling and the Law. Impact on legal gambling In 1979, while still a student at Harvard Law School, Rose developed the theory of the Third Wave of Legal Gambling.\\"The Legalization and Control of Casino Gambling,\\" Fordham Urban Law Journal, vol.8, p.245 (Winter, 1980) Examining the dates when laws had been enacted in the past, he concluded that legal gambling had twice before swept the nation. He correctly predicted that state lotteries, casinos and other forms of gambling would once again be made legal in the United States. According to the theory, legal gambling will continue to spread, until it is once again outlawed. (citation needed). The Third Wave of Legal Gambling theory inspired both entrepreneurs and governments to expand legal gaming, in part because it showed how much money could be made by the initial operators. \\"Suppose Prohibition of alcohol had just been repealed. The hypothetical owner of the first and only liquor store in a state would make a fantastic return on investment.\\" The Third Wave of Legal Gambling theory explains why the states differ so much in their approaches to gaming. Rose showed the legal problems created by prohibitions in state constitutions dating from the 19th century on lotteries. For example, in 1990, the Mississippi Supreme Court discussed Rose's Third Wave of Legal Gambling theory in oral argument, concluding that that state's ancient constitutional ban on \\"lotteries\\" did not prevent the Mississippi Legislature from legalizing charity bingo.Knight v. State of Mississippi, 574 So.2d 662 (1990). The next year the Legislature authorized casinos, making Mississippi the third leading casino state, after Nevada and New Jersey. Rose has also been involved in other major developments involving legal gambling in the U.S. and abroad. He has worked with governments and industry in legalizing and regulating casinos, poker, bingo and lotteries. (citation needed). He also was instrumental in the introduction of contests of skill and subscription and other games with free alternative means of entry. He wrote the legal opinion for PurePlay.com, the world's largest no-purchase- necessary poker site.San Francisco's Pure Play gambles on legality of online poker site. Rose's testimony led to the introduction of Texas hold 'em and Pai Gow Poker into California cardrooms in the 1980s;Huntington Park Club Corp. v. County of Los Angeles, 206 Cal.App.3d 241, 253 Cal.Rptr. 408 (1988)Walker v. Meehan, 194 Cal.App.3d 1290, 240 Cal.Rptr. 171 (Cal.Ct.App. 1987)Sullivan v. Fox, 189 Cal.App.3d 673, 235 Cal.Rptr. 5 (Cal.Ct.App. 1987). His work with tribes and suppliers on the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and in testifying on what is legal on Indian landUnited States v.162 MegaMania Gambling Devices, 231 F.3d 713 (10th Cir. 2000)United States v.103 Electronic Gambling Devices, 223 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2000)Diamond Game Enterprises, Inc. v. Janet Reno, 230 F.3d 365 (U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit 2000). helped lead to the creation of the modern tribal bingo hall and casino. In 1999, the California Supreme Court cited Gambling and the Law in striking down Proposition 5, which had won the most expensive initiative campaign battle in the nation's history, and which would have legalized tribal casinos as \\"lotteries.\\"Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Int'l. Union v. Davis, 21 Cal.4th 585, 981 P.2d 990, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 56 (1999). In 2006, the first NAFTA tribunal involving gaming adopted Rose's testimony, on behalf of the federal government of Mexico, on what constituted a slot machine as opposed to a game of skill.International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States The North Dakota Supreme Court also adopted his position on what is a slot machine.Midwestern Enterprises, Inc. v. Wayne K.

California State Lottery, 13 Cal.4th 375, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 812, 917 P.2d. 651 (June 24, 1996). In \\"Compulsive Gambling and the Law\\", Rose described how the views of society, and thus of the law, toward problem gambling are changing. In his writings and public presentations, he explained how courts and lawmakers were struggling with the concept that a person might bet too much because they were ill, rather than because they were morally weak.\\"Compulsive Gambling and the Law: From Sin to Vice to Disease,\\" presented before the American Society of Criminology, November 8‚Äì9, 1989, Reno, Nevada. He incorporated the California Counsel on Problem Gambling, wrote the bill providing funding for the Texas Counsel on Problem Gambling. In 1990, he argued the case of Erickson v. Desert Palace, Inc., before the Ninth Circuit, on behalf of a 19-year-old boy who was denied a million-dollar slot machine jackpot by Caesars Palace, and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the appeal.942 F.2d 694 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1476 (1992). . Rose was instrumental in getting governments and operators to put in place protections for compulsive and underage gamblers. Rose is the co-author of \\"Internet Gaming Law\\" (1st. and 2nd. editions), Blackjack and the Law,. and the first casebook on the subject, \\"Gaming Law: Cases and Materials\\".. His most recent book, co-authored in 2012, is Gaming Law in a Nutshell.. Rose is co-editor-in-chief of the Gaming Law Review & Economics.Gaming Law Review He is a consultant to governments and industry and has testified as an expert witness on gaming in administrative, civil and criminal cases. Education and legal practice Rose graduated from UCLA with a B.A. in 1973 and with a J.D. in 1979 from Harvard Law School. Immediately following graduation from Harvard, Rose moved to Hawaii to practice law. He passed the Hawaii and California bars and has also been admitted to practice in federal courts, including Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court. While in Hawaii, Rose established the state's first eye bank, the Hawai'i Lions Eye Bank & Makana Foundation, in 1981. He helped get state law changed to allow donor stickers on drivers' licenses and permit trained nurses to harvest tissue. Rose served as legal counsel to the eye bank from 1981-1983. (citation needed). Teaching Rose joined what was then named Whittier College School of Law in 1973 as a Visiting Assistant Professor. Over the years, he was promoted to Full Professor with tenure. In Fall 1983, Rose developed and taught the first law school class on Gaming Law.Robert M. Jarvis, \\"A Survey of Law School Gaming Courses,\\" Gaming Law Review, vol. 11, Issue 3 (2007)Liebertonline.com: A Survey of Law School Gaming Courses Today there are at least 31 law schools with courses in Gaming Law, as well as graduate business schools and undergraduate colleges, many using the casebook Rose co-authored. In 1993-1994, Rose became the first Visiting Scholar for the University of Nevada-Reno's Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. His Gaming Law classes were open to undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing lawyers and regulators. At that time, Nevada had no law school, so Rose was the only person teaching Gaming Law in the nation's leading state for legal gaming. In 2004, Rose taught a seminar on International Gaming Law for Whittier Law School's Summer Abroad program in China. He taught the same class the following years in Spain and France. He also taught classes on gaming law to the FBI; at colleges in Slovenia; and, at UNR's professional training courses in Reno, Tahoe and Macau. Rose began co-teaching, with Professor Jorge Godinho, a graduate level class in Gaming Law at the Masters and Postgraduate Programs in International Business Law at the University of Macau in 2007. Most of the students have law degrees from China, Macau or countries in the Portuguese-speaking world, such as Angola and East Timor. Rose has taught the course every summer, in May or June, since 2007. He has also participated as the lead judge for students defending their Masters' theses on issues related to legal gambling. Consultant and expert witness Rose has testified as an expert witness in administrative, civil and criminal cases throughout the United States, in Australia and New Zealand, including the first NAFTA tribunal on gaming issues. He has acted as a consultant to major law firms, international corporations, licensed casinos, Indian tribes, and local, state and national governments, including the states of Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas; the District of Columbia; the provinces of Ontario and Qu√©bec; and the federal governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States. (citation needed) Rose's clients include regulators, such as the Arizona Department of Gaming, the Delaware State Lottery (regulates sports books and racinos), the Illinois Gaming Board, the Texas Comptroller (regulated bingo) and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. He has also worked with the largest operators, including Nevada and Atlantic City casinos, California cardrooms, state and national lotteries, race tracks, Indian tribes and online gambling operators. (citation needed) Rose has testified as an expert on legal gambling before the California Legislature, Hawaii House of Representative's Finance Committee, New Mexico Legislature and Oregon Governor's Task Force on Gaming. He has worked with the Florida State Senate on Indian gaming, the Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation's Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering on poker rooms, and the Washington State Gambling Commission on casinos.

It is set in Paris in 1793‚Äì1794, closely tied to specific events of the French Revolution.  Plot  The story of the rise of √âvariste Gamelin, a young Parisian painter, involved in the local government for his neighborhood of Pont-Neuf, The Gods Are Athirst describes the dark years of the Reign of Terror in Paris, from Year II to Year III. Fiercely Jacobin, Marat and Robespierre's most faithful adherent, √âvariste Gamelin becomes a juror on the Revolutionary Tribunal. The long, blind train of speedy trials drags this idealist into a madness that cuts off the heads of his nearest and dearest, and hastens his own fall as well as that of his mentor Robespierre in the aftermath of the Thermidorian Reaction. His love affair with the young watercolor-seller √âlodie Blaise heightens the terrible contrast between the butcher-in-training and the man who shows himself to be quite ordinary in his daily life. Justifying this dance of the guillotine by the fight against the plot to wipe out the gains of the Revolution, in the midst of the revolutionary turmoil that traverses Paris, Gamelin is thirsty for justice, but also uses his power to satisfy his own vengeance and his hatred for those who do not think like him. He dies by that same instrument of justice that up until then has served to satisfy his own thirst for blood and terror.  Analysis  Gamelin's profession of painter also reflects on the book's theme. His best work is a depiction of Orestes and Electra, with Orestes resembling a self-portrait of the artist; Gamelin, like Orestes, is capable of killing his family. √âlodie later comes to be identified with Electra ‚Äì though, in her affair with Gamelin, where she loves him first for his mercy and then for his violence, and takes a less radical lover after he dies, she also represents France. The character of Maurice Brotteaux is very interesting. Without being reactionary, this former noble is well aware of the problems the Revolution faces in this period and finds the charges unjustified. One might think that this character speaks for the author. The title, Les dieux ont soif, is taken from the last issue of Camille Desmoulins's Le Vieux Cordelier, which criticized the Jacobins; that line in turn was supposedly taken from an Aztec explanation of the necessity of human sacrifice. The novel includes a wide variety of sexual relationships. In chapter XXI France depicts a brief failed attempt at a same-sex liaison. Julie has been wearing men's clothing to avoid being recognized. A middle-aged man has often smiled at her, expressing what she thought was \\"discreet sympathy\\" for her plight. One day when it begins to rain he invites her to share his umbrella. Startled by her voice when she accepts, he runs away, leaving her rainsoaked. \\"She suddenly understood, and despite her worries could not prevent herself from smiling.\\"  References  External links * Category:1912 French novels Category:Novels by Anatole France Category:Novels set in the French Revolution Category:Novels about artists Category:Works about Maximilien Robespierre Category:Cultural depictions of Maximilien Robespierre ","title":"The Gods Are Athirst"},{"id":"29899926","text":"Jess Lee Brooks (June 10, 1894 ‚Äì December 13, 1944), also known as Jesse Brooks, was an American actor.

It has a length of , of which lie in the forested mountains of the Harz and the rest on the agricultural lowlands of the Harz Foreland.  Course  The Selke Valley near Meisdorf. A retention basin is planned here. View of the Selke Valley from Old Falkenstein Castle The Selke rises near the village of Friedrichsh√∂he in the borough of G√ºntersberge at a height of about above NN. From Friedrichsh√∂he to M√§gdesprung in the borough of Harzgerode, it is accompanied by the Selke Valley Railway for a distance of . The Selke has cut deeply into the Harz Mountains in some places whilst in others it runs in a broad valley, depending on the bedrock. In Meisdorf on the northeastern edge of the Lower Harz, the Selke leaves the forested mountain region and winds across a cultivated plain, continuing to flow in an easterly or northeasterly direction as far as Ermsleben. Beyond Ermsleben the river swings through 90¬∞ to the northwest and runs from here in an almost straight line to its mouth on the Bode near , a village in the borough of Wegeleben. The Selke empties into the Bode at an elevation of . In the past Selke burst its banks on several occasions causing significant damage. This led to plans by the state government for the expansion of existing floodwater retention basins and the creation of a new one. Particularly controversial is a medium- term high embankment for the Selke Valley at Meisdorf. The citizens' initiative \\"Save the Selke Valley in the East Harz\\" is fighting this plan because they argue that it will destroy a scenically beautiful section of the Selke Valley that is important for nature conservation.  Castles  High above the Selke Valley is a striking and largely preserved medieval castle, Falkenstein, which is open to the public. On the other side of the valley, on a prominent spur, is a lofty viewing point, the Selkesicht, above sea level, and at the site of another castle, the Ackeburg, with good views of Falkenstein Castle and the Selke valley.

First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, it was given its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is long, white in colour, and there is no ring on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2‚Äì11.7 micrometres. The mushrooms are considered edible, but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species. A. ceciliae is found in woods throughout Europe and North America, where it fruits during summer and autumn.  Taxonomy and etymology  Amanita ceciliae was first described by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and Christopher Edmund Broome, a British mycologist, in 1854. It is placed in the genus Amanita and section Vaginatae. Section Vaginatae consists of mushrooms with special characteristics ‚Äì such as the absence of a ring, and very few clamp connections at the bases of the basidia. The name Amanita inaurata, given by Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan in 1833, has also been used for this species. In 1978, the name was declared nomenclaturally incorrect according to the rules of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Other synonyms are Agaricus ceciliae, Amanitopsis inaurata and Amanitopsis ceciliae. The present name, Amanita ceciliae, was given by Cornelis Bas, a Dutch mycologist, in 1984. The species is commonly called \\"snakeskin grisette\\". Another common name is \\"strangulated amanita\\", referring to the tightly clasping volva. It is also called Cecilia's ringless amanita after Cecilia Berkeley, the wife of M. J. Berkeley. The name was meant \\"to record the services which have been rendered to Mycology by many excellent illustrations and in other ways\\".  Description  A collection of Amanita ceciliae showing typical colouration, from mountains in Piacenza. Amanita ceciliae is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is long, white in colour, and there is no ring on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2‚Äì11.7 micrometres. The cap is across, shape ranging from convex to flat. It is upturned, and has a deep-coloured margin. There is a low umbo. It is grey to a brownish black in colour, darkest in the center and paler towards the margin. Generally smooth, the cap surface is slightly sticky when moist. The cap surface is characterized by having loose, fleecy, charcoal-grey patches of volval remnants scattered across it. The patches are easily removed. The margin is strongly striated. The cap colour may vary, and pale forms are known to exist, for example, as in the types A. c. f. decolora and A. c. var. pallida. A. c. var. royeri, first described by mycologist L. Maire in 2008 and occurring in France, is a cinder black-capped variation. Gills are free and closely spaced, and white in colour. They can be thick, and are often forked. The stem is long, and x thick. It is lightly stuffed (filled with a cottony tissue) and then hollow, and there is a slight tapering to the top. It is white in colour, with flat grey hairs, often in a zig-zag pattern. It does not bear a ring and has fragile, cottony, brownish or charcoal-coloured oblique girdles of volval remnants around the stem base and lower stem. The volva is white to grey, powdery and delicate. The flesh is white and does not change colour when cut. Although it lacks any distinctive odor, it tastes sweet. Spores are white in colour, spherical and are not amyloid. They measure 10.2‚Äì11.7 ¬µm. A few large-sized spores are commonly found in a mount of gill tissue. Clamps are not found at bases of basidia. Lookalikes Amanita sinicoflava (occurring in North America) looks quite similar, but it has a sack-like volva, unlike A. ceciliae. A. antillana, of the Antilles islands, is somewhat the same, but it has ellipsoid spores unlike the spherical ones of A. ceciliae. A. ceciliae is often used as a misnomer for A. borealisorora, which largely occurs in North America. A. borealisorora is a provisional name, and the species has not yet been validly published. The spores of A. ceciliae highly resemble those of A. cinctipes (mainly found in Singapore), though the former has larger spores. The discolouration in the volva of A. colombiana (from Colombia, as its name states) probably shows a relationship between the mushroom and A. ceciliae. A. sorocula is another lookalike. This Colombian and Mesoamerican species is often mistaken for A. ceciliae, as both mushrooms have a volva with a weak structure and greying gills. The notable difference is the strong yellow colour of the cap in immature A. ceciliae mushrooms. A. sorocula is not yet validly published, and currently is a newly accepted name. The Chinese species A. liquii is similar but the yellow-brown, red-brown or green- brown coloured cap of A. ceciliae are much different from the brown-black cap of A. liquii. Also, the volval remnants of A. ceciliae converge at the base to form a ring-like zone, unlike A. liquii. Apart from this, the cellular pigments in the sterile strip around the gills and volval remnants are much darker in colour compared to A. ceciliae.  Edibility  An immature specimen from the southern Appalachian mountains Amanita ceciliae is considered an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it as a good edible species. A study of 16 edible mushrooms was done to learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among these species, A. ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical scavenging activities. Ecology and habitat ;Europe In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is widespread everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), but it can also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils. ;North America In North America, it is found mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar mushrooms also occur in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas. Its range also stretches south into Mexico. They are ecologically mycorrhizal, and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees). Introduced species Apart from its native area, A. ceciliae has also been reported from Asia. These regions include Japan, Azad Kashmir and Iran. There is speculation that North American collections could possibly be an undescribed species differing from the European A. ceciliae.

A common assumption in establishing chronosequences is that no other variable besides age (such as various abiotic components and biotic components) has changed between sites of interest. Because this assumption cannot always be tested for environmental study sites, the use of chronosequences in field successional studies has recently been debated.  Applications   Forest sciences  Since many processes in forest ecology take a long time (decades or centuries) to develop, chronosequence methods are used to represent and study the time-dependent development of a forest. Field data from a forest chronosequence can be collected in a short period of several months.  Soil science  Chronosequences used in soil studies consist of sites that have developed over different periods of time with relatively small differences in other soil- forming factors. Such groups of sites are used to assess the influence of time as a factor in pedogenesis.  Ecology  Chronosequences are often used to study the changes in plant communities during succession. A classic example of using chronosequences to study ecological succession is in the study of plant and microbial succession in recently deglaciated zones. For example, a study from 2005 used the distance from the nose of a glacier as a proxy for site age.

It is still practiced in certain areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, mainly among the Kochis. Although baad is illegal under Afghan law, many of the victims do not know their rights, and still more are prevented from exercising them. Description After a person commits a serious crime, a council of elders called jirga decides the punishment. The punishment for a smaller crime is a fine in the form of money or livestock. Standard penalty for a crime such as murder is for the offender's family to give a female to the victim's family. In theory, the female is given in forced marriage to a male in the victim's family. In practice, the female given in baad becomes an equal member of the new family and as a domestic worker. Baad sometimes leads to domestic violence. The practice of baad has no Islamic basis. It is rather considered un-Islamic and illegal. As per the Hadith, \\"A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness).\\" [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim & Others].United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (2009), Justice for Children in Conflict with the Law, pp. 50, 358-361 Afghan law Baad is a criminal offense under Article 517 of the 1976 Afghan Penal Code, but the Article applies only if a widow and woman above age 18 is given under Baad. According to Afghan law, the sentence for perpetrators of baad (i.e., forcing a woman into marriage and slavery through baad) cannot exceed two years of prison. No jirga elder or family is known to have been arrested or tried for taking or giving a girl in baad. The practice of baad is mostly reported in Afghanistan's provinces of Kunar, Helmand and Balkh.

Personal life He was born in Bergen as the youngest son of factory owner and ship-owner Peter Jebsen (1824‚Äì1892) and Sophie Catharina Sundt (1849‚Äì1912). He was a brother of Kristian Gerhard Sundt Jebsen and maternal grandson of Christian Gerhard Ameln Sundt. In 1917 he married attorney's daughter Lilla D√∏scher. He was a granduncle of Kristian Gerhard Jebsen and Atle Jebsen, and an uncle of Kristian Jebsen. Career Jebsen finished education in machine engineering at Bergen technical school at the age of seventeen, and studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule Hannover and the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg. He took the doctorate in Zurich in 1905 with the thesis Zur Kenntnis der Phenoxymucobrom- und Chlors√§ure als aromatische Verbindungen. From 1905 to 1906 he studied at Sorbonne. In 1906 he was hired in Sam Eyde's company Elektrokemisk. Together with Peder Farup he discovered and innovated the use of titanium dioxide as the pigment titanium white; together with the exploitation of the S√∏derberg electrode, this was the most important innovation during Jebsen's time. The process of producing titanium white was figured out in 1914. Before that, Jebsen had become chief executive officer of Elektrokemisk in 1912. In 1916 he became chairman of the new company Titan Co. which produced titanium dioxide. In 1919 he briefly served as the first president of the Federation of Norwegian Industries. During the post-World War I economic crisis he had to leave Elektrokemisk in 1920, but became chief executive officer of Titan Co. in 1924. The shares in Titan Co. plummeted until being bought in 1927 by the American corporation National Lead along with the patent rights for titanium white. Jebsen was hired in National Lead, and worked out of Paris, from 1929 as chief executive of Titan Co. Inc in Europe. The corporation included companies such as Titangesellschaft in Germany and British Titan Products. In 1940 Jebsen moved from Paris to New York City. In 1943 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet, exiled from Norway because of the war, named industrial committees consisting of expatriates in London and New York, and Jebsen worked for the New York- based committee. For his work here he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav after the war, in 1946. He died in January 1951 in London.

Silviculture: concepts and applications,pg 5, 2nd ed. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press. Stand level modelling is a type of modelling in the forest sciences in which the main unit is a forested stand. Stand description A forest stand is commonly described as in 10ths or 10%s. Thus a ratio could be given of: 3 Ponderosa pines, 2 mangrove trees, 5 silver spruces. If there was a mixed stand that stand mix could be described as mixed up to 10%, mixed 10‚Äì40% and a mixed stand over that amount. The form of mixing of the tree types is commonly given as: * individuals ‚Äì when there are a few unconnected trees of a type. * troop ‚Äì up to 5 trees connected of one type. * group ‚Äì when there are more than 5 trees, but they are shorter than a harvestable tree. * thicket ‚Äì when there are more than 5 trees, but they are taller than a harvestable tree to around 0.5 ha. * rotten group (cluster) ‚Äì a packed together standing aggregate of trees, trees in the rotten group have different heights and different depths or a stripwise arrangement. Rotten is from German, Rotte and means pack. These trees are linked together in small rotten groups separated by bigger interstices. This means they are ideal for mountain afforestation.http://www.waldwissen.net/waldwirtschaft/waldbau/bergwald/wsl_rottenaufforstung/index_DE Stand spacing A stand's spacing may be described by the crown cover of the trees. It can thus be delimited as: *Packed ‚Äì the crowns all overlap when looked at from above *Closed ‚Äì the crowns all touch, but do not overlap *Light ‚Äì when there is space between the crowns that is even *Spacey/gappy ‚Äì when a few trees are close and yet there are many clearings between these little groups Purpose Stands are not logical, ecologically defined management units. Instead they have evolved from the Normalwald concept, which was predicated on the idea of harvesting efficiency and thus that forest land was primarily to generate income from timber production. Stands allow easier forest inventory and planning. The concept has by way of extension been applied across all forestry practice in the world, but originated in the Mitteleuropa of the late 18th and early 19th century with the mercantilist tradition, Prussian education and emergence of modern silviculture. Along with the Normalwald concept has come the idea that stands are standardized in terms of size, species mix, age class and other tree metrics and that forestry should aim to impose this on nature where it has not existed up till now.A Ctitique of Silviculture Managing for Complexity K.J. Puettmann, K D. Coates and C. Messier 2009 Alternatives As stand is from an economic timber forestry perspective, it is very focused on the tree element of forests. It is not considerate of the other elements within a forest such as shrubs, animals or topography and alternative terms may better fit ecological or other land value purposes within forests. The English term grove is one example. Also proposed is eco-unit.Forests: Elements of Silvology by Roelof A.A.

In his younger days he was a rugby player of some note playing at county level and representing the Barbarians. Personal history Walker was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Yorkshire in 1873 to William Walker, a mines' engineer, and his wife Margaret. The 1881 census records Walker at the age of eight now living in Guisborough along with his parents and five siblings. He was educated at Durham School. He served his time as a mining engineer at Bearpark Colliery, Durham and later gained his certificate of competence as a manager. In 1902, following posts as manager of ironstone mines in East Cleveland, North Yorkshire, he was appointed Assistant Inspector of Mines, initially in the Southern district, moving in 1905 to the Durham district.Geographical areas of responsibility extracted from Mines Inspectors annual reports. In 1910 he was promoted to Senior Inspector for the Midland and Southern district, before being made Divisional Inspector for Scotland in 1915. In 1920 he became the Deputy Chief Inspector of Mines and was also recognised by the Crown when he was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1924 he replaced Sir Thomas Mottram as the Chief Inspector of Mines for Great Britain. In 1928 Walker was knighted and in 1937 he was made an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John. In his role as Deputy and Chief Mines Inspector, Walker was involved in the inquiries of some of the worst mining disasters of the period, these included the Medomsley cage fall in 1923, the Glamorgan Colliery explosion in Llwynypia in 1932 and the 1934 Gresford disaster in Wrexham. Walker is particularly remembered for the controversial outcome of his 1937 inquiry into the Gresford disaster, which saw 266 men killed in an underground explosion. Although Walker was critical of the mine owners to the state of part of the mines in his report debated in the House of Commons, he failed to find fault in the area where the explosion happened. In his inquiry he found the mine's management only guilty of inadequate record keeping. Walker was succeeded in his role as Government's Chief Inspector of Mines in 1938 by Frederick Horton Wynne. Following his retirement he was appointed as a chairman on a government committee to look at the problem of the suppression of dust in mines. To mine owners he was a strong and just administrator of mining laws and regulations; to management he was a sound judge of mining practice and he was respected by the miners' leaders. Rugby career Although never representing his country, Walker played at all national levels of rugby union. He first played as a schoolboy for Durham School, and continued to represent the school as an Old Dunelmians. He played amateur rugby for Yorkshire County (1900‚Äì1901) and Durham (1903‚Äì1908). In the 1897‚Äì98 season he accepted an invitation to join British touring team, Barbarian F.C., playing a single match against Percy Park. Family life Walker married Susan Carson in 1909 and they had two sons, she died in 1953. Walker died 3 August 1954 at his home at Worplesdon in Surrey aged 81. His elder brother (Sir) William Walker (c.1864-1930) was Chief Inspector of Mines in 1919-20.

The concept of the reflecting function was introduced by Uladzimir Ivanavich Mironenka. Definition For the differential system \\\\dot x=X(t,x) with the general solution \\\\varphi(t;t_0,x) in Cauchy form, the Reflecting Function of the system is defined by the formula F(t,x)=\\\\varphi(-t;t,x). Application If a vector-function X(t,x) is \\\\,2\\\\omega-periodic with respect to \\\\,t, then \\\\,F(-\\\\omega,x) is the in-period \\\\,[-\\\\omega;\\\\omega] transformation (Poincar√© map) of the differential system \\\\dot x=X(t,x). Therefore the knowledge of the Reflecting Function give us the opportunity to find out the initial dates \\\\,(\\\\omega,x_0) of periodic solutions of the differential system \\\\dot x=X(t,x) and investigate the stability of those solutions. For the Reflecting Function \\\\,F(t,x) of the system \\\\dot x=X(t,x) the basic relation : \\\\,F_t+F_x X+X(-t,F)=0,\\\\qquad F(0,x)=x. is holding.

A. Straubinger on the subject of inedia. Straubinger visits several people who supposedly nourish themselves with \\"light\\" and tries to find possible explanations on how inedia might work. Straubinger researched inedia for ten years. This led to the film's production, which took five years. The film premiered on May 13, 2010 at the March√© du Film.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1593636/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt  Plot  P.A. Straubinger first encounters inedia in a television documentary about Nicholas of Fl√ºe, a 15th-century ascetic who was reported to have lived 19 years without eating. Later, Straubinger starts research on the internet and subsequently has the desire to meet people practising inedia. He travels through different countries and interviews people who claim to nourish themselves with light, vitality, Prana or Qi, among them Jasmuheen, Michael Werner and \\"Mataji\\" Prahlad Jani. Straubinger also consults different people from classical and alternative medicine and science and looks for explanatory models for inedia. Straubinger conveys that for him, the materialistic world view of modern science falls short.http://www.amanfangwardaslicht.at/http://www.kino-zeit.de/filme/am- anfang-war-das-licht Straubinger's conclusion is credulous and contradicted by the available evidence. Some breatharians have submitted themselves to medical testing, including a hospital's observation of Indian mystic Prahlad Jani appearing to survive without food or water for 15 days, and an Israeli breatharian appearing to survive for eight days on a television documentary. In a handful of documented cases, individuals attempting breatharian fasting have died. Among the claims in support of Inedia investigated by the Indian Rationalist Association, all were found to be fraudulent. In other cases, people have attempted to survive on sunlight alone, only to abandon the effort after losing a large percentage of their body weight. Cultural impact According to Straubinger, In The Beginning There Was Light polarized critics, and the controversy contributed to the film's financial success. In the German Das Erste talk show Menschen bei Maischberger and two TV-discussions on ORF in Austria, critics warned that the film could motivate people to stop eating. Straubinger responded that this would be a complete misunderstanding of his film, repeatedly stating that he does not want to motivate anybody to stop eating but he would advocate eating consciously without asserting any particular nutritional ideology. Straubinger says that the film shows cases of starvation related to the Breatharian Process communicated by the Australian author Jasmuheen, and also features proponents and experts who warn not to make dangerous self-experiments or try a breatharian lifestyle out of \\"spiritual ambition\\".http://www.lightdocumentary.com/the-joy-of-food.html In Switzerland, according to the national newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, a woman who saw the film attempted to live on sunlight alone, and died in January 2012. The film's official website calls articles that implicate a responsibility of In The Beginning There Was Light for the woman's death a hoax, and presents as support for this claim a facsimile of an e-mail that the responsible state attorney wrote to the director in which he confirms that no third party could be made responsible for the death of the woman and an adequate causality between the film and the death could be definitely excluded.http://www.lightdocumentary.com/breatharian-death.html Awards and Festivals * Austrian Ticket / Austrian Film Award - Prize for the most successful Austrian Film of the Year * Bergen International Film Festival - Official Selection http://arkiv.biff.no/filmbase/2010/in_the_beginning_there_was_light.html * Munich International Film Festival - Official Selection http://www.filmfest- muenchen.de/profil/filmfest-highlights/highlights-2010/filme-2010-(1)/liste- der-filme-im-programm.aspx * Vukovar Film Festival - Official Selection http://www.vukovarfilmfestival.com/vff5/hr/program/film/21/  References   External links    Interview with P.A.

It was based on the 1955 short story \\"Petticoat Brigade\\" by Chester William Harrison (1913‚Äì1994) that he expanded into a novelization for the film's release. It was directed by Hamilton Luske, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures and filmed at the Iverson Movie Ranch and at Old Tucson. The fictional story tells the tale of an Army deserter training a disparate group of women to become Indian fighters climaxing in a Battle of the Alamo type action. Plot In 1864, during the American Civil War, Texan Lt. Frank Hewitt (Audie Murphy) is serving with the U.S. Cavalry under Colonel John Chivington. On patrol, Hewitt meets a group of Indians who are unarmed and returning to the Sand Creek reservation which they were not supposed to leave. While being briefed by Hewitt, the colonel orders the attack known to history as the Sand Creek Massacre. Hewitt not only disagrees with the punishment of the Indians, but realizes they will use the attack as an excuse to unite and spread terror throughout the Southwest, including his own hometown in Texas which has been emptied of the majority of its men who are fighting for the Confederacy. Colonel Chivington sees Indian attacks on Texas as a bonus to create havoc in the Confederacy. Violently objecting, Hewitt is placed under arrest and confined to quarters. Hewitt deserts to warn the Texans but is hated and ignored as a traitor by his now Confederate former neighbors, who despise him for serving with the Union. No one believes him until he brings home the dead body of a woman murdered by Comanches who have joined the uprising. Hewitt organizes a brigade of women training them in marksmanship and combat tactics. Armed and given military ranks, Hewitt and the women seize the day and hold on to the only safety they have in an abandoned mission (Fort Petticoat). Hewitt, the \\"blue belly traitor\\", and the petticoat brigade face desertion from the only remaining man and fight off scavengers and Comanches as they struggle to build trust and work together during the ensuing attacks. As the final gun fight is over, Hewitt and his greatest female critic fall in star-crossed-love left over from childhood memories. But Hewitt cannot reciprocate because as an honorable soldier he must return to his post at Sand Creek and face charges for desertion. Col. Chivington's commanding general happened to enter the trial room in the final hour as Hewitt is being renounced as a deserter and a liar about a most fantastic story of helping to rescue the women in Texas and training them to fight off Comanches. As the guilty sentence and execution is about to be pronounced, the female confederates return the favor, marching armed into the trial to stop the proceeding. The commanding general, in a surge of sentimental good will, orders a surrender to the armed ladies who have saved the day and proved Hewitt's truthfulness. Hewitt's testimony snares Col. Chivington (who is relieved of command and ordered held for trial) and his hopes in his new-found Confederate love are restored. Cast * Audie Murphy as Lt.

Named and , the ships were intended to be Brazil's first step towards becoming an international power, and they consequently initiated a South American naval arms race. In 1904, Brazil began a major naval building program that included three small battleships. Designing and ordering the ships took two years, but these plans were scrapped after the revolutionary \\"dreadnought\\" concept rendered the Brazilian design obsolete‚Äîtwo dreadnoughts were instead ordered from the United Kingdom, making Brazil the third country to have ships of this type under construction‚Äîbefore traditional powers like Germany, France, or Russia. As such, the ships created much uncertainty among the major countries in the world, many of whom incorrectly speculated the ships were actually destined for a rival nation. Similarly, they also caused much consternation in Argentina and consequently Chile. Soon after their delivery in 1910, both Minas Geraes and S√£o Paulo were embroiled in the Revolt of the Lash (Revolta da Chibata), in which the crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of corporal punishment in the navy. The mutineers surrendered after four days, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved. In 1922, the two battleships were used to help put down a revolt at Fort Copacabana. Two years later, lieutenants on S√£o Paulo mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to Montevideo, Uruguay, and obtained asylum. Minas Geraes was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were too old to participate actively in the Second World War, and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in Salvador and Recife. S√£o Paulo was sold in 1951 to a British shipbreaker, but was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to its final destination. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to Genoa the following year.

Restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries and major vessels under construction in both navies were sold as part of the British-mediated three pacts which ended the dispute, but both countries retained the numerous vessels built in the interim.Scheina, Naval History, 45‚Äì52.Garrett, \\"Beagle Channel Dispute,\\" 86‚Äì88. As such, by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage, despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 403. Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive on the part of prominent Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power.Scheina, Naval History, 80. A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the National Congress of Brazil in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. Two factions argued over the types of ships to be ordered. One favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships, while the other preferred a larger navy of smaller warships. The latter originally prevailed with a bill authorizing the construction of three small battleships, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, three submarines, and two river monitors.English, Armed Forces, 108. Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral J√∫lio C√©sar de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 240‚Äì245. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800 long tons (12,000 tonnes), have a speed of 19 knots (22 mph; 35 km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9 inches (23 cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8 cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25 cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 244‚Äì246. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 33.  Bidding and construction  Design 439 was modified before these ships were laid down, increasing the displacement to and making them slightly longer and wider. Two of these ships were laid down by Armstrong at Elswick in Newcastle upon Tyne (Minas Geraes and Rio de Janeiro), while the other was subcontracted out to Vickers in Barrow (S√£o Paulo). However, the new dreadnought concept, which was showcased upon the completion of the namesake ship in December 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 246. A transition to a few large warships was finalized with the selection of Rear Admiral Alexandrino Faria de Alencar for the powerful post of minister of the navy.Scheina, Naval History, 81. The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by de Alencar to building two dreadnoughts, with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed, two scout cruisers (which became the Bahia class), ten destroyers (the Par√° class), and three submarines.\\"Brazil,\\" Naval Engineers, 883‚Äì884. The three battleships on which construction had just begun were demolished beginning on 7 January 1907. An entirely new design incorporating the latest dreadnought technology was drawn up by J.R. Perrett, the head of Elswick Ordnance Company, and approved by the Brazilian government on 20 February 1907.\\"Brazil,\\" Naval Engineers, 834. Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the 1902 treaty that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year. , the lead ship, was laid down by Armstrong on 17 April 1907, while its sister ship followed thirteen days later at Vickers. Construction of the partial hull needed to launch Minas Geraes was delayed by a four-month strike to 10 September 1908, and S√£o Paulo followed on 19 April 1909.Scheina, Naval History, 321.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 404.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 249.\\"Minas Geraes I,\\" Servi√ßo de Documenta√ß√£o da Marinha ‚Äì Hist√≥rico de Navios.\\"S√£o Paulo I,\\" Servi√ßo de Documenta√ß√£o da Marinha ‚Äì Hist√≥rico de Navios. Both were christened in front of large crowds by the wife of Francisco R√©gis de Oliveira, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom.\\"Launch Greatest Warships,\\" The New York Times, 11 September 1908, 5.\\"Launch Brazil's Battleship,\\" The New York Times, 20 April 1909, 5.

The third dreadnought, which would have been named and was provided for in the original contract, was laid down on 16 March, but as the ship had already been eclipsed by new naval technology (chiefly the advent of super- dreadnoughts, beginning with the British ), the Brazilian government canceled it on 7 May and asked Armstrong to prepare a new design.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 249, 254. At this time, the dreadnought design had not been fully validated, despite the success of the British namesake;Scheina, Naval History, 354. for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement‚Äîwhich had not been utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American ‚Äîwould cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret.\\"The Brazilian Battleship,\\" United States Artillery, 187‚Äì188.\\"The New Brazilian Battleships,\\" The Times, 22 January 1910, 16f. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during S√£o Paulos gun trials in June 1910.  International reaction  Minas Geraes conducting its gun trials, at that time the heaviest broadside ever fired off a ship The start of work on Minas Geraes meant that Brazil had become the third country‚Äîbehind the United Kingdom and the United States but ahead of major powers such as Germany, France, Russia and Japan‚Äîto have a dreadnought under construction.Whitley, Battleships, 13. The order for the dreadnoughts caused an immediate stir in the United States and Europe; in the words of the British Navy League Annual, they \\"astonished the naval world\\".Quoted in Scheina, Naval History, 81 from The Navy League Annual, 1910‚Äì1911, 103. The American New York Times opened an article on Minas Geraes launch with \\"What on paper at least is the most powerful warship ever built for any navy ...\\", while Scientific American called Minas Geraes \\"the last word in heavy battleship design and the ... most powerfully armed warship afloat.\\"\\"The Brazilian Battleship,\\" Scientific American, 240. Some publications, like the American Advocate of Peace, decried the dreadnought purchase for its cost, calling it \\"a showy and pretentious naval policy seemingly for the sheer indulgence of national pride\\" and continuing with \\"[sinking] money into useless warships when, it is understood, foreign money has had to be borrowed for city improvements in Rio de Janeiro is pitiful politics.\\"Mead, \\"Reaction,\\" 238‚Äì239. The British House of Commons debated purchasing the ships in March 1908 to bolster the Royal Navy while simultaneously ensuring they would not be sold to a foreign rival. The topic arose again in July and September, when Arthur Lee expressed his discomfort at the possible final dispositions of the Brazilian ships, as any sale had the potential to disrupt their \\"Two-Power Standard\\".\\"British and Foreign News,\\" Evening Post, 12 September 1908, 13. International Marine Engineering analyzed the effect of a sale to Japan, stating that the total broadside weight of Japan's line of battle would be increased by 31.6%, and the only ships capable of matching the Minas Geraes in the near future would be the American and German es.\\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" International Marine Engineering, 362‚Äì363. Newspapers and journals around the world speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament.Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 77.Mead, \\"Reaction,\\" 238. The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to float a multi- million-dollar loan against the value of their coffee crop in 1908 were unsuccessful.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 247. With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming ), a Spanish naval journal stated \\"it was only natural that rumors [would begin] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction.\\"Quoted in Scheina, Naval History, 354 from Revista General de Marina 64 (1908): 724. Various British papers speculated that either the Germans, Japanese, or Americans were actually buying the ships, while naval experts in Germany thought the Americans, British, or Japanese were going to take them over.\\"British- Brazilian Warships,\\" The Navy, 11‚Äì12.\\"The Brazilian \\"Dreadnoughts\\",\\" The Navy, 13‚Äì14.\\"The Race for Naval Supremacy,\\" Nelson Evening Mail, 6 April 1909, 2. On the other side of the Atlantic, some American papers theorized that the ships would be sold to the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan.\\"Germany May Buy English Warships,\\" The New York Times, 9 August 1908, C8.\\"Another British Dreadnought and a Brazilian Battleship on the Water,\\" The New York Tribune, 11 September 1908, 4.\\"Brazil, Japan, and Great Britain,\\" The Sun (New York), 1 July 1908, 6. The Brazilian government was forced to deny these spurious allegations several times.\\"The Reported Purchase of Battleships,\\" The Navy (Washington), 39; \\"Brazilian Minister and 'No Ulterior Designs',\\" Lancashire Evening Post, 19 April 1909, 2; \\"Brazilian Battleship Launched at Barrow,\\" Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer, 20 April 1909, 5. The New York Times remarked: Despite the speculation, the United States quickly began courting Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, US naval journals began using terms like \\"Pan Americanism\\" and \\"Hemispheric Cooperation\\". In South America, the ships came as a rude shock and kindled a naval arms race among Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts. Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca, remarked that either Minas Geraes or S√£o Paulo could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. While this may have been hyperbole, either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet.Scheina, \\"Argentina,\\" 400. As such, the Argentines quickly responded to the dreadnoughts with an order to the United States for two of their own, the , while Chile ordered two of the from the United Kingdom.Scheina, Naval History, 82‚Äì85.

Although the President offered political asylum to the King and his family, the offer was refused.Ribeiro, \\"Os Dreadnoughts.\\" There was a rumor that the King was on board and revolutionaries attempted to search the ship, but were denied permission. They also asked for Brazil to land marines \\"to help in the maintenance of order,\\" but this request was also denied.\\"The Journey from Lisbon,\\" The Times, 8 October 1910, 5‚Äì6a. S√£o Paulo left Lisbon on 7 October for Rio de Janeiro,\\"Movements of Warships,\\" The Times, 8 October 1910, 6a. and docked there on 25 October.  Revolt of the Lash  Soon after S√£o Paulos arrival, a major rebellion known as the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, broke out on four of the newest ships in the Brazilian Navy. The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when Afro-Brazilian sailor Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the Lei √Åurea (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of Minas Geraes, S√£o Paulo, the twelve-year-old , and the new quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on Minas Geraes and one each on S√£o Paulo and Bahia were killed.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 32‚Äì38, 50. Sailors pose for a photographer on board Minas Geraes, probably during the ship's visit to the United States in early 1913. The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers‚Äîled by Jo√£o C√¢ndido Felisberto‚Äîwas the abolition of \\"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including b√¥lo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) and the use of whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 40‚Äì42. Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser , Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125‚Äì23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 44‚Äì46. During the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well-handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. Jo√£o C√¢ndido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch were not, which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while S√£o Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 39‚Äì40, 48‚Äì49, 52.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 73.  Later career  Three years after the mutiny, Minas Geraes was used to transport Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs Lauro M√ºller to the United States.\\"Brazilian Envoy Host on Warship,\\" The New York Times, 12 July 1913, 7.\\"Tell Brazil's Envoy of Trade Problems,\\" The New York Times, 18 June 1913, 14.\\"E Minas Geraes,\\" Navios De Guerra Brasileiros. The ship returned on 16 July and arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 16 August. In September both Minas Geraes and S√£o Paulo participated in a major exercise with most of the Brazilian Navy. The need for more modern fire control system was identified as early as late 1913, but no action was taken.\\"E S√£o Paulo,\\" Navios De Guerra Brasileiros. When Brazil entered the First World War in 1917, they were offered to the United Kingdom for service in the Grand Fleet, but the British declined due to the condition the ships were in. They had not been modernized since entering service, and maintenance had been neglected; to illustrate the problem, when Brazil sent S√£o Paulo to the United States for a modernization in June 1918, fourteen of the eighteen boilers that powered the ship failed. The ship only finished the voyage to New York with the assistance of the American battleship and cruiser .Whitley, Battleships, 26, 28. Minas Geraes followed after its sister's return, and the modernization was done between 1 September 1920 and 1 October 1921.Whitley, Battleships, 26. Minas Geraes after its 1930s modernization, possibly during the Second World War S√£o Paulo made two trips to Europe in 1920. The first conveyed King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium to Brazil for the centennial celebrations. After S√£o Paulo brought them home, the ship traveled to Portugal to take the bodies of the formerly-exiled Emperor Pedro II and his wife, Teresa Cristina, back to Brazil.Whitley, Battleships, 28‚Äì29. In July 1922, both battleships helped to quash the first of the Tenente revolts (Revolu√ß√£o Tenentista), in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. S√£o Paulo shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns.Poggio, \\"Um encoura√ßado.\\" In 1924, three lieutenants, including Hercolino Cascardo, took over S√£o Paulo with other crewmen. They were unsuccessful in swaying any other ships to their cause, except for an old torpedo boat, and soon sailed out of the harbor after firing a six-pounder gun at Minas Geraes. Short of food and with condensers in poor condition, the rebels sailed to Montevideo, where they received asylum. Minas Geraes followed S√£o Paulo, arriving on 11 November and taking back possession of the ship.Scheina, Naval History, 77‚Äì79. Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard from June 1931 to 1938,Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 289. while S√£o Paulo led a naval force that blockaded Santos during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932. Though Brazil had also intended to modernize S√£o Paulo, its poor condition‚Äîshe was only able to make instead of its designed speed of ‚Äîmade such action uneconomical.Whitley, Battleships, 29. Soon after Brazil's entrance into the Second World War on 21 August 1942,Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 162‚Äì164. S√£o Paulo was moved to Recife on 23 August to defend that port as a harbor defense ship; Minas Geraes played a similar role at Salvador. Even with the modernization, Minas Geraes was simply too old and vulnerable to actively participate in the war.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 164. Both ships were decommissioned after the war, S√£o Paulo on 2 August 1947 and Minas Geraes on 31 December 1952. The former was sold to a British shipbreaker and was towed out of Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951. When north of the Azores in a strong storm, the tow line snapped. Though multiple searches were mounted by American and British aircraft, the ship was never found. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian company in 1953 and towed to Genoa from 11 March 1954 to 22 April.  Specifications  main and secondary batteries (fig. 2 and 3), from the Journal of the United States Artillery (1910) The two ships of the Minas Geraes class were overall, at the waterline, and between perpendiculars. They had a beam of , a mean draft of , a maximum draft of , a normal displacement of 18,976 long tons (19,281 t), and a displacement of 20,900 long tons (21,200 t) at full load. At the beginning of their careers, the ships were crewed by about 900 men. Minas Geraes and S√£o Paulo were originally armed with twelve 12-inch/45 caliber, twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, eighteen 3-pounders and eight 1-pounder naval guns. The main battery was arranged with four superfiring turrets, two each fore and aft, and two placed en echelon. The 4.7-inch secondary guns were placed in casemates along the side of the ship. The propulsion of the two ships was provided by Vickers vertical triple expansion engines instead of the steam turbines being used to power most contemporary dreadnoughts. Eighteen boilers provided power to the engines, which in turn rotated the two three-bladed propellers with 23,500 shaft horsepower. Their designed top speed was , though this was frequently unattainable in their later careers owing to substandard maintenance and neglect. The ships could carry of coal and of oil, and their original endurance was when traveling at .Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Battleship,\\" 250. During its trials, Minas Geraes was able to steam at .Earle, \\"Professional Notes,\\" 306. The main armor belt was Krupp cemented and nine inches (230 mm) thick, but narrowed to six and three inches (150 and 76 mm) closer to each end of the ships. The barbettes were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300 mm) front, eight-inch (200 mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51 to 76 mm) top, and the conning tower had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to two inches (38 to 51 mm), one inch (25 mm), and one inch.

He became an Esperantist in 1905, wrote for many publications and was active in Esperanto youth groups. With Charles Pichon (b. 1893) he co-founded Francan Federacion de Junaj Esperantistoj (French Federation of Young Esperantists). Life and career Ferdinand Duviard was born in Fontenay-sous-Bois, Seine-Saint-Denis. His parents were Auguste Emile Duviard (1859‚Äì1949) and Valentine Clotilde Fabre (1858‚Äì1942), the daughter of novelist Ferdinand Fabre (1827‚Äì1898). He learned Esperanto at age 16 in 1905, the year of the first Universal Congress of Esperanto at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Duviard edited the magazine Juneco (\\"Youth\\") during 1909 and 1910, and he was a member of Lingva Komitato, the guiding committee for the Esperanto language, until shortly after the end of World War I. In 1910 he married his first wife, Elisabeth Antoinette Adam (1883‚Äì1965), by whom he had two sons, Pierre (1911‚Äì2001) and Jacques (1915‚Äì2000), and a daughter, H√©l√®ne (1912‚Äì2008). Ferdinand, Elisabeth and their three children lived until November 1915 on rue Moli√®re in La Roche-sur-Yon, before settling in the Paris region of Coulommiers.Henri Masson, L'esp√©ranto en Vend√©e: L‚Äôid√©e de langue internationale √† travers les noms de voies de circulation de La Roche-sur-Yon (\\"Esperanto in Vend√©e: The idea of the international language through street names of La Roche-sur-Yon\\"), 2nd ed., June 2009. Retrieved 5 December 2010=3. The writer Dominique Duviard (1940‚Äì1983), was a grandson of Ferdinand Duviard; he contributed a preface to a modern reprint of Ferdinand's book Les Cotillons barr√©s. The couple divorced in 1924, and he remarried Anna Marie Marsan (1906‚Äì1960) the following year. Duvard's fourth child, Fran√ßois Eug√®ne Duviard-Marsan (1926‚Äì2007) was later to become Governor of Rotary International and received a knighthood, the Ordre National du M√©rite. Duviard was a brother-in-law of Carlo Bourlet (1866‚Äì1913), who died at age 47, and whose \\"immense merit\\" was acknowledged by L. L. Zamenhof, the father of Esperanto. Bourlet's wife, Th√©r√®se Marie Adam (1872‚Äì1923), was the sister of Duviard's first wife Elisabeth Antoinette Adam. Esperanto and World War I Ferdinand Duviard was a registered participant at the 1914 tenth Universal Congress of Esperanto in Paris. The success of this congress ‚Äì masterfully organized by Carlo Bourlet, and which had 3,759 Esperanto registrants from 50 countries ‚Äì was to have a significant impact. The congress was cancelled because war was declared on 2 August 1914, the very day the Esperanto Congress was to have begun at the Gaumont Palace. During the First World War, Esperantists devoted great efforts to the search for soldiers missing in action and prisoners of war. In the January‚ÄìMarch 1916 issue of Juneco, an article entitled \\"The French Press\\" states: \\"We find in the newspapers, of which we give names below, press releases on Esperanto and on various services rendered by Esperantists since the war began. We sincerely thank the said newspapers, as well as the Esperantist friends who have submitted these items.\\" Under the headline \\"A success of Esperanto,\\" the 9 August 1915, issue of the newspaper La Petite Gironde highlighted the efforts of Esperantists concerning the search for the missing and the results obtained. La France de Bordeaux wrote: \\"The La Roche-sur-Yon group produced such results that the Nantes group will organize a similar service.\\" Le Temps of 18 August published separate press releases from the La Roche Esperanto group and from the Le Mans Esperanto club on the issue of soldiers missing in action. Academic career In 1927 Duviard earned his Doctorat √®s Lettres from Aix-Marseille University; his thesis topic was Honor√© de Balzac.Ferdinand Duviard, Un pr√©d√©cesseur de Ferdinand Fabre: Balzac romancier clerical dans le Cur√© de Tours. Cahors: Imprimerie Bergon, 1926, 55 p.

Duviard wrote numerous articles and was much concerned with helping young people. With journalist Charles Pichon, of Saumur, he co-founded the French Federation of Young Esperantists. His name appears in the Enciklopedio de Esperanto published at Budapest in 1933. Ferdinand Duviard died in La Roche-sur-Yon, Vend√©e, Pays de la Loire.

The station was opened in 1859 by the Austrian Empire's S√ºdbahn. It is located on the trans-Alpine Brenner Railway and a terminus of a branch line to Merano/Meran (County of Tirol's former capital), which continues to become Vinschgau Railway Merano/Meran-Malles/Mals. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). The commercial area of the passenger building, however, is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia, √ñBB-DB, S√ºdtirol Bahn and Russian Railways (RZD). Location Bolzano/Bozen railway station is situated at Piazza della Stazione / Bahnhofplatz, at the southeastern edge of the city centre and a short, 5-minute walk away. History The station was opened on 16 May 1859, upon the completion of the Trento-Bolzano/Bozen section of the Brenner Railway. It was known as Bozen-Gries Bahnhof. The passenger building was designed by the Bozner architect Sebastian Altmann.  County of Tyrol  In 1864, construction began on the final section of the Brenner Railway between Bolzano/Bozen and Innsbruck. This section was completed on 24 August 1867. In 1871, rail services in the area were enhanced by the inauguration of the Puster Valley Railway (Pustertalbahn), which connected Bolzano/Bozen directly to Maribor/Marburg in today's Slovenia through San Candido/Innichen and Lienz. Train services today require three changes at Bressanone/Brixen, Lienz and Graz and are separately operated by Trenitalia, S√ºdtirol Bahn, √ñBB and Slovenian Railways (SZ). In 1881, a third railway line, Vinschgau Railway, joined the Bolzano/Bozen station through Merano/Meran, County of Tyrol's capital city. In order to cater for frequent holiday makers, it was extended in 1906 from Merano to Malles/Mals. From 1898 to 1974, Bolzano/Bozen was the terminus of the √úberetsch Railway to Caldaro/Kaltern. Transfer to Italy After the First World War, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) rewarded Italy with County of Tyrol's territory south of the Brenner Pass. As a result, Bozen-Gries station was transferred to the Italian railway network and came under the management of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). From 1927 to 1929, the station building was replaced by one in the style of Italy's fascist regime. It was designed by the architect Angiolo Mazzoni. The facade on the access road to the station was reworked into two half-columns and flanked by two statues, which were crafted by the Austrian artist Franz Ehrenh√∂fer, to represent electricity and steam. Ehrenh√∂fer also created masks on the cornices for the station complex, a fountain of St. Christopher and an allegory of River Adige (River Etsch) above the entrance to the clock tower, Features The passenger building hosts the main ticket office, Deutsche Bahn ticket office and a waiting room. Other facilities include a cafe-bar and a newsagent store. There are six platforms for passenger service and additional tracks for freight traffic. Train services Aerial view of the station. The station has 5.5 million passenger movements per year and is therefore the busiest within the region in terms of passenger numbers. Since 2010, the station has been a stop for the weekly EuroNight train of Russian Railways between Moscow and Nice.

History  Sited at the top of a staircase leading to the eponymous square, the church was founded in 1323 by the Franciscans, and was originally dedicated to Santa Maria Maggiore. It obtained the current denomination in the mid-15th century. In 1454, the Dalmatian master Giorgio da Sebenico executed the portal, inspired to the late Gothic one of the Porta della Carta in the Ducal Palace of Venice. In the 18th century the church was raised and enlarged by design of architect Francesco Maria Ciaraffoni, who also built the two annexed monastery and the two cloisters. After the Napoleonic occupation the complex was used as a hospital and, from the 1920s, as a Civic Museum. The church was restored and reopened in 1953. The 18th- century bell tower, which had been destroyed by an Allied bombardment in 1944, was rebuilt at the same time.  Description  The main feature of the fa√ßade is the portal, designed by Giorgio da Sebenico with an ornate frame featuring twenty heads and, at the sides, two tall pilasters housing four niches with statues of saints. Above the portal is a Gothic lunette with a bas-relief of St. Francis receiving the Stigmata and, above it, a shell supporting a hexagonal baldachin. The portal leads to a staircase which was rebuilt in the 1920s. The interior has a single nave and is in 18th-century style.

Although the district is still notable for the preservation of 18th and 19th century structures, several late-20th century residences have been added (such as modular homes). In addition, by 2007 a proposal had been made to develop a tract of land at the southwest corner of Schodack Landing and Muitzeskill Roads to accommodate 30 to 40 new residences.

In the first quarter of the 20th century he was a famous satirical singer-songwriter. His popularity peak was in the years of war (1914‚Äì1917) when he began to be called the ¬´King of eccentrics¬ª.Dmitry Gubin, Playing during the eclipse, Ogonyok periodical ‚Ññ26, iuni 1990, pag.26-27, ISSN 0131-0097 ru It was also the time when he became friends with Aleksandr Blok. Considering that the period of his greatest popularity was almost at the exact time as the brief period of renaming the capital, Savoyarov can be called the Petrograd artist in the strict sense of the word.  Biography  Mikhail Nikolayevich Savoyarov (Solovyov) was born on 30 November 1876 in Moscow. As a child he didn't receive music education. He learned to play violin without a teacher, also took private lessons. In the end of the 1890s Savoyarov moved to Saint Petersburg, started working as a violinist in a private opera house, and then in the Palace Theatre. The repertoire of these theatres included mostly operettas, which influenced his style. Savoyarov made his d√©but on stage as an operetta tenor comedian by chance substituting for an ill actor. He had a success though not grand. Having an independent streak, soon he quit the theatre and started living on his own resources. Since 1905 he was seen playing in musical single-show companies (so called ‚Äúcapellas‚Äù), Russian, Little Russian, Gipsy or pseudo- French ones which were in fashion and brought profit. In 1905 Savoyarov began to compose and sing topical songs, set at first to operetta or folk songs music and later to his own melodies. Poetic and musical talent advanced him as a singer-songwriter. His repertoire included mostly songs and trolls accompanied by piano, violin, dancing, pantomime and eccentric acting often turned into brazen antics and buffoonery.Encyclopedia of Variety and Circus, ru It's significant that his style of acting coincides with his last name Savoyarov that comes from French word savoyard which means a strolling musician, a troubadour from Savoy. In 1907 Savoyarov had a success on fair of Nizhny Novgorod where he performed together with his first wife Ariadna Azagarina. Earlier she was famous in single-show companies as a French cabaret singer. Performing as ‚ÄúFrench-russian duet‚Äù they had a repertoire that consisted of comic and satiric scenes including singing, dancing, disguise and impersonations using theatrical costumes, make-up, mise-en-sc√®nes and even decorations. Mikhail Savoyarov a postcard (1914) In 1914 Savoyarov published his first collection of texts of his own composition and joined the Society of Dramatists and Composers. At the age of 40 he wrote his best songs and reached the height of his fame. Savoyarov's favorite character is a fl√¢neur of high society, dandy, petty bourgeois, low dives frequenter with a rumpled or well- pressed dress coat and a top hat or a bowler on, a cane in a hand and a chrysanthemum in his buttonhole. Sometimes Savoyarov also used a mask of a criminal, and for such cases he composed special topical songs. One of them represented the author: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a thief , that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm proud of, and my name is Savoyarov‚Äù. Playing ‚Äúhimself‚Äù on the stage is typical of his work. There were times when his limited popularity as a satirist and humourist was a burden to Savoyarov who was trying to break through genre barrier of high poetry with such works as the dramatic melodeclamation titled Glory to Russian woman (of military-patriotic character) or the dramatic scene The Aviator‚Äôs death which however didn‚Äôt have much success. Savoyarov‚Äôs popularity reached its peak by 1916‚Äì1917. His comic topical songs such as \\"Kisanka, Walked, Thank you kindly, Our Culture, Because of the Ladies\\"SovLit, Poeticheskaya Kniga (Collection of poetry), 1900-1955, ru were reissued and many times and were very popular to quote, and the eccentric scene ‚ÄúMoon oh moon, are you drunk indeed?‚Äù was sung by literally everyone in Petrograd. The countless couplets of Our culture had a particularly big success. Many actors included them into their repertoires with the author‚Äôs consent and also repeatedly ‚Äústole‚Äù them. The reproachful chorus of this song (‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the fruits of education, here‚Äôs our culture!‚Äù) was used by different authors to create renewed versions of the late 1920s. During 1915‚Äì1917, many of Savoyarov‚Äôs topical songs were notable for satirical and political jokes. Therefore not all of them were published constantly being censored and abridged in the number of couplets. During wartime, Savoyarov met Aleksandr Blok who attended his concerts in cinemas and caf√© chantant a dozen times in 1914‚Äì1918. Sometimes Blok brought actors who recited his poems and plays onstage. Thus in 1918 he persistently showed Savoyarov‚Äôs performances to his wife L.D. Mendeleyeva-Blok so that she could ‚Äúadopt‚Äù his eccentric manner (for reading \\"The Twelve\\" poem). Vsevolod Meyerhold also attended Savoyarov‚Äôs concerts while working on his play Balaganchik (‚ÄòThe Puppet Show‚Äô). According to Blok, Savoyarov‚Äôs Balaganchik was ‚Äúway better than ours‚Äù. Here‚Äôs one of his notes on this subject that Blok wrote in his journals: > \\"...Liuba finally saw Savoyarov who plays on tour in miniature close to us. > ‚Äî Why measuring ounces of Alexandrians‚Äô talent who always perform after > lunch and before dinner if there‚Äôs a real art in ‚Äòminiature‚Äô?...\\" > ::::::::::::::::::::::‚Äî Aleksandr Blok, sketchbooks (20 March 1918). Mikhail Savoyarov playing the role of a criminal, a postcard (1915) Blok didn't recite \\"The Twelve\\" himself because he couldn't do it well. Usually, his wife performed reading of the poem. However, according to the audience who listened The Twelve performed by Liubov Dmitriyevna her did it poorly, falling into bad theatricism. A big woman with massive arms bare almost to her shoulders was rushing about on the stage dramatically shouting and gesticulating, sitting down and jumping up again. It seemed to some of the audience that Blok didn‚Äôt like listening to Lyubov Dmitriyevna‚Äôs reading either. But it was unlikely to be truth because Blok was always advising her and showing how to recite the poem. That‚Äôs why he was taking Lyubov Dmitriyevna to Savoyarov‚Äôs concerts. Apparently Blok believed The Twelve poem should be recited in this specific rough and eccentric manner, the way Savoyarov did it playing the role of a criminal from St. Petersburg. However Blok himself didn‚Äôt know and didn‚Äôt learn how to recite. To do that he would have to become, as he put it, a ‚Äòvariety poet and singer of satirical songs‚Äô himself. Savoyarov didn‚Äôt leave it unanswered. Specially for the famous guest of his concerts he wrote a few mock verses imitating ‚Äòwith delicate irony‚Äô Blok‚Äôs most popular lines or intonation (for example: ‚ÄúA night. A street. A lamp. A drugstore‚Äù turned into ‚ÄúA store. A crowd. A low price‚Äù). Being aware that Blok is in the audience Savoyarov always performed such satirical songs for him. The live dialogue between the two poets during the concert delighted the public. Like Blok, Savoyarov tried to cooperate with the new regime during the first years after the October Revolution. He headed the Petrograd variety actors‚Äô union for three years. Then however he was supplanted by ‚Äòreal‚Äô proletarian actors. During the 1920s Savoyarov endeavoured to be relevant, referring to new Soviet themes, he kept on writing and performing. Among the songs performed by his second wife, artiste Yelena Nikitina (1899‚Äì1973) the most successful were the operetta Proletarian's song and a love song parody You're still the same where the decadent intonations of Vertinsky were derided. Savoyarov continued to give concerts all over the USSR up until 1930. He was over 50 at that time. His repertoire of that time includes satirical songs \\"What a thing to happen!\\" (in Charleston beat), monologues in ¬´Rayok¬ª genre (rhymed humorous \\"talk shows\\", a special kind of rhymed prose) such as You say, we‚Äôre going to far; I want to love the whole world (1925), musical feuilleton ‚ÄúRecords, big deal!‚Äù (1929), a parody song Little bricks and other. However Savoyarov couldn't repeat his Petrograd success of 1915. By the early 1930s, Savoyarov stopped giving concerts. The political situation in the country stood stock-still, socialist associations of creative professions were formed and it became impossible to organize concerts independently. The Bolshevik Party didn't welcome any eccentric, satirical in particular. In 1933 Savoyarov moved from Leningrad to Moscow where he lived the rest 7 years of his life. He died (or was killed?) a month and a half after the war on Germany started. On 4 August 1941 Mikhail Savoyarov died of heart rupture during the bombing in the 43 Lesnaya street gateway. He wouldn't hide in the bombshelter during the air raids.  Artistic influence  Mikhail Savoyarov a postcard (1913) Savoyarov was the first to the Russian music scene his own eccentric style of performing different from circus or theatre. In the 1910s both success and influence follow the ‚Äòmusic concerts‚Äô of Igor Severyanin as well as poetry accompanied by Mikhail Kuzmin. However, it was Aleksandr Blok who was influenced the most by eccentric style of an artist and even poet Savoyarov. It's the most evident in his post-revolutionary works. According to academic Shklovsky few comprehended ¬´The Twelve¬ª poem and condemned it because everyone was used to take Blok seriously only. The Twelve, a portrayal of criminal revolutionary Petrograd, which was compared by Shklovsky to the Bronze Horseman by Pushkin, had brand new images: > ¬´...The Twelve is an ironical work. It‚Äôs written not even with folk rhyme > but with ‚Äúflash‚Äù language. A Savoyarov style of street trolls¬ª. Viktor > Shklovsky The Writing Table // V.B. Shklovsky, The Hamburg Account: > articles, memoirs, essays (1914-1933), Moscow, Sovetsky Pisatel, 1990. , . > :::::::::::::::‚Äî (Viktor Shklovsky, the Hamburg account: articles, memoirs, > essays (1914-1933). Shklovsky talked about Savoyarov's songs in ‚Äòragged genre‚Äô performing which he would go on stage dressed and painted as a criminal. George Balanchine, a choreographer, forever memorized Savoyarov singing thieves songs: ‚ÄúAlyosha, sha! ‚Äì take a half-tone lower, stop telling lies‚Äù... Such criminal atmosphere in The Twelve poem pervades Petrograd, a frightful city of the snowy winter of 1918. Savoyarov put musical in common practice parody songs of (or responses to) other authors. The most famous of them were Child, don‚Äôt hurry (a response to Mikhail Kuzmin‚Äôs romance Child and rose) and You‚Äôre still the same (a parody of Vertinsky‚Äôs romance Your little fingers smell incense). Often during his concerts in the 1920s Savoyarov would change costumes, make himself up and performed the second part under the name (and the mask) of ‚Äòartist Valertinsky‚Äô. This did a good turn for Vertinsky who wasn't forgotten during the period of his immigration. Savoyarov's easy manner of singing, gesticulating, constantly moving around the stage and playing the violin had a profound effect. After the manner of Savoyarov, in the 1920-30s playing violin his disciple, a singer of satirical songs Grigory Krasavin, the first performer of the famous Bublichki (‚ÄòBagels‚Äô) of Yakov Yadov, started performing. Yuri Khanon, Saint Petersburg, 2008. In the 1930s both in Leningrad and Moscow many artists learned from Savoyarov. Among the most famous disciples of that period Arkady Raikin is pre-eminent. Nowadays hardly anybody remembers that in 1930s Raikin started not as a reciter and satirist but as a musical eccentric and a dancer mime and that his first fame and the title of laureate of the all-USSR variety actors competition came to him thanks to his dance and mimic numbers Chaplin and Mishka. That was also the time when Alexander Menaker learned a lot from Savoyarov. His school of eccentric can be distinguished in Andrei Mironov, Menaker's son's, manner of performing and in musical parts of young Konstantin Raikin. One of Savoyarov's songs of 1915 (rural scene Trumpeters) is performed by Andrei Mironov in Eldar Ryazanov‚Äôs film (O Bednom Gusare Zamolvite Slovo, 1981) Say a Word for the Poor Hussar (‚Äú...across the village are running the boys, the girls, the women, the kids, like a swarm of locusts, the trumpeters blow the trumpets‚Äù ).Mikhail Savoyarov (ru) The music for this number was rewritten by the composer Andrei Petrov, but the lyrics by Savoyarov remained the same. Perhaps the most evident artistic influences of Mikhail Savoyarov can be considered his grandson, a composer, a 1988 ‚ÄúEuropean Oscar‚Äù winner and also an ingenious writer and artist working under a pseudonym Yuri Khanon. // Encyclopedie of Cinema, Bio ru The eccentric Mikhail Savoyarov may have found his new incarnation in him...partly philosophically and academically. Another king of eccentrics‚Äô granddaughter, Tatyana Savoyarova is also known as an eccentric artist (partly surrealist and mocker). Savoyarov's artistic style was distinguished by the charms of ‚Äòvery lively‚Äô performance, by natural musicality, plasticity, subtle nuances, the strong ability to transform, the ability to reveal the text and subtext, supplementing the singing with dancing and mimic scenes. Such a performance has one drawback: it must be seen and listened to in person. The archives didn't save neither gramophone recordings nor film fragments. Savoyarov only heritage left is published music, photographs and collections of poems.

Phil was brought up in England with strong influences from his Irish ancestry. He was educated at Rugby School and studied Art and Special Education at college in Bath. On leaving college he lived in London, Portugal and then in Whitby, North Yorkshire, all with fellow artist Ann Woods, seeking to establish himself as a painter while earning money through a variety of jobs including van driving, farmwork and teaching. From 1974 to 1981 he exhibited his work in small galleries wherever he lived, some in Portugal, some in the UK. In 1982 he made his first visit to Mexico and a new chapter in his life began. Until now his paintings were influenced by such artists as Freud, Auerbach and Jack Yeats and by the landscape and colours of Northern Europe. Now the colour and light of Mexico brought a new dimension to his work. He stayed for three years and by chance was out of the country when the Mexican earthquake devastated the apartment where he lived, killing his partner Blanca. Kelly returned to London, working where he could, usually teaching and exhibiting in several small London galleries, these were often one-man shows. The lure of Mexico and particularly the city with its extreme existence, its palm trees and brightly painted VW taxis was irresistible. In 1989 he was back and in the following year married Ruth Munguia, an experienced arts administrator, who took over the management of his exhibitions and professional life. Regular exhibitions followed in Mexico and occasionally in London, with several pieces selling at Christie's (1991 and 1992). In 1993 Ruth and Phil's first daughter, Ana Elena, was born. 1996 was a breakthrough year for Kelly with a significant exhibition at the Westbourne Gallery in London, an exhibition at The Hay Festival of Literature, with one of his paintings featured on the cover of The Festival Brochure and a major exhibition at the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo in Mexico City: Babel Descrifada. This exhibition caused debate and some notoriety in the Mexican press, but Kelly's reputation was firmly established. Daniel Dultzin, Mexican ambassador to Ireland, championed his work and his first Irish exhibition opened at The Frederick Gallery in Dublin, in 1997, further exhibitions followed both at The Frederick Gallery and in later years at Hillsboro Fine Art. 1997 also saw the birth of Maria Jose, Phil and Ruth's second daughter. Attending events at embassies in Mexico and Ireland, Kelly befriended the poet Seamus Heaney and his wife, the writer Marie Heaney, painting them several times and adding illustrations to their works published in Mexico. The chef, writer and broadcaster, Rick Stein commissioned a series of paintings for his Seafood Restaurant in Padstow, Cornwall, UK and has written about Phil for the national press. In 1999 Kelly became a Mexican citizen. Notable Mexican collectors of Phil's work include the poet Pura Lopez Colome, wrestler Marco Rascon Cordova and businessman Sergio Autrey Maza. Regular exhibitions take place in Mexico, Ireland and occasionally in England. Kelly's work is the work of an urban painter, one who lived in the ultimate urban environment of Mexico City. As well as the many cityscapes of Mexico DF, Kelly produced a number of striking figurative works, paintings of Oaxaca and Dublin, seascapes of Mexico and Cornwall and many ink drawings. Phil Kelly's paintings are still exhibited regularly and he has work in several notable Mexican museums, including The Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City and The Museum of Modern Art of Oaxaca. Various paintings and drawings have been used as artwork for books published in Mexico, Ireland and in the UK and there are many pieces in private collections.

Early life Pierce was born in Bristol to a Roman Catholic Irish mother and an unknown father. He spent the first two years of his life in Nazareth House, a Catholic orphanage in the spa town of Cheltenham, and was adopted by a family from Swindon and brought up on a council estate there. His adoptive father worked on the assembly line at British Leyland, a former state-owned car factory. Pierce was educated at St Joseph's Roman Catholic School, now known as St Joseph's Catholic College, a state comprehensive school in Swindon. He did not go to university.  Controversies  In 2014, the Daily Mail had to pay damages to Kirsten Farage after Pierce falsely claimed in a column that she had been a mistress of Nigel Farage, then the leader of UKIP, while he was still married to his first wife. In May 2018, the Daily Mail paid ¬£11,000 towards the legal costs of the writer Kate Maltby after the publication of an article by Pierce about the claims of sexual harassment Maltby made against the politician Damian Green. The article was removed from the Mails website without the publication having made an admission of fault. Career in journalism Pierce first became interested in right-wing politics as a first-time voter in 1979. He is a former Assistant Editor of both The Daily Telegraph and The Times newspapers, and an ex- Political Editor of the latter. He is a columnist and Consultant Editor for the Daily Mail, which he joined in 2009. Pierce presented a Sunday morning political radio show on the commercial radio station LBC 97.3 from 2008 until he left in 2012. That radio programme was in the latter years presented as a double-headed show with Kevin Maguire from the Daily Mirror. Pierce and Maguire continue their double act reviewing, previewing and dissecting the media and politics on the BBC, ITV and Sky News. He started presenting a Saturday Breakfast show on LBC Radio from 22 March 2014. His LBC show currently runs Friday evenings 6‚Äì9 pm Personal life Pierce was raised, and remains, a Roman Catholic. He is openly gay, strongly supports civil partnerships, and lives in a long-term civil partnership, per the Civil Partnership Act 2004. He said it was therefore pointless to introduce gay marriage, and criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for treating it as a priority. In a BBC documentary in 2018 about Greg Owen and the court case National AIDS Trust v NHS Service Commissioning Board, Pierce strongly criticised the idea of taxpayer-funded PrEP, a preventative medication to protect against contracting HIV: \\"That's what this is about: indulging gay men who don't want to use a condom. Well that's outrageous. Why should the taxpayer subsidise a reckless sex life of people in the gay community?\\" Iris Prize The Iris Prize Festival is a five-day public event in Cardiff, Wales, which includes screenings of the 30 short films competing for the Iris Prize. The Iris Prize is supported by the Michael Bishop Foundation and is the world's largest LGBT short film prize giving the winning filmmaker ¬£30,000 to make their next short film in the UK. Iris produced shorts include Burger (2013) directed by Magnus Mork List of films at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, and Followers (2015) directed by Tim Marshall, both selected for the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. Andrew Pierce became Patron of the Iris Prize in 2007, and in 2013 became its first Chair. During his tenure as chair of the Iris Prize, Pierce has overseen a number of key developments in the festival. In 2014 at a launch reception Pierce announced a new strand at the Iris Prize Festival, Best British Short, and helped secure a sponsorship deal with Pinewood Studios Group totalling ¬£14,000 in post-production sound for the winning filmmaker. In January 2015 it was also announced that the Iris Prize would be increasing from ¬£25,000 to ¬£30,000.

It surfaced in the first half of the 14th century at St. Rumbold's Cathedral in the City of Mechelen.The earliest Brabantine Gothic style elements were built soon after 1333 when the Prince- Bishop of Li√®ge passed his feudal claim on Mechelen, in particular through its cathedral chapter, to Louis II, Count of Flanders, who married the heiress of Brabant and in 1355 took the title of Duke of Brabant. Reputed architects such as Jean d'Oisy, Jacob van Thienen, Everaert Spoorwater, (This architect is also known as Evert van der Weyden.) Matheus de Layens, and the Keldermans and De Waghemakere families disseminated the style and techniques to cities and towns of the Duchy of Brabant and beyond.About Gothic architecture in the Low Countries, the Dutch-language term kustgotiek ('Coastal Gothic') occurs. Apparently, that literature describes its present-day national coastal areas: in the Netherlands mainly the subject found in this WP article under Counties of Holland and of Zeeland; in Belgium (including topics about Zeelandic Flanders) mainly (a variant of) Scheldt Gothic. Mostly fifteenth-century constructions, Gothic churches in the former Duchy of Guelders are Lower Rhine Gothic, following a style from the area along the Lower Rhine in present-day Germany. For churches and other major buildings, the tenor prevailed and lasted throughout the Renaissance. Harbingers Brabantine Gothic, in a Low Countries context also referred to as High Gothic, differs from the earlier introduced Scheldt Gothic, which typically had the main tower above the crossing of a church, maintained Romanesque horizontal lines, and applied blue-gray stone quarried from the vicinity of Tournai at the river Scheldt that allowed its transportation in particular in the old County of Flanders. Mosan Gothic (Meuse Gothic) refers to the river Maas (or Meuse, borrowed from French), mainly in the south-eastern parts of the Low Countries: the modern provinces of Limburg in the Netherlands, Limburg, and Li√®ge in Belgium. Though of a later origin than Scheldt Gothic, it also still showed more Romanesque features, including smaller windows. Marlstone was used, and around the capitals on limestone columns are sculptured leaves of irises. Characteristics Two centuries of Brabantine Gothic design Surface conditions and available materials varied. Larger churches could take centuries of building during which expertise and fashions caused successive architects to evolve further from the original plans. Or, Romanesque churches became rebuilt in phases of dismantling and replacing, as (apart from its crypt) Saint Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent: the early 14th-century chancel is influenced by northern French and Scheldt Gothic, a century later a radiating chapel appeared, and between 1462 and 1538 the mature Brabantine Gothic west tower was erected; the nave was then still to be finished. Though few buildings are of an entirely consistent style, the ingenuity and craftsmanship of architects could realize a harmonious blend. The ultimate concepts were drawn centuries after the earliest designs. It follows that Brabantine Gothic style is neither homogeneous, nor strictly defined.Because in many cases, a building shows characteristics of several styles, it may be more accurate to use predicates like 'Gothic' for elements instead of for the entire building. Nevertheless, it is customary to categorize a building by its mainly perceived style, or occasionally by its most noteworthy features. A Gothic building may have been constructed or rebuilt well after the typical period. E.g., apart from one gallery and the ground floor by Rombout II Keldermans, the edifice designed as seat of the Great Council of the Netherlands at Mechelen finally got built following his drawings in the early 20th century, and became a 'new' wing of the City Hall. Features The Brabantine Gothic style originated with the advent of the Duchy of Brabant and spread across the Burgundian Netherlands. Besides minor influences by the High Cathedral of Saints Peter and Mary in Cologne, the architecture builds on the classic French Gothic style as practiced in the construction of cathedrals such as those in Amiens and Reims. Grote Kerk in Dordrecht The structure of the church buildings in Brabant was largely the same: a large-scale cruciform floor plan with three- tier elevation along the nave and side aisles (pier arches, triforium, clerestory) and a choir backed by a half-round ambulatory. The slender tallness of the French naves however, was never surpassed, and the size tended to be slightly more modest. Grote Kerk in Haarlem It is characterized by using light-coloured sandstone or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but is erosion-prone. The churches typically have round columns with cabbage foliage sculpted capitals. From there half-pillar buttresses continue often without interruption into the vault ribs. The triforium and the windows of the clerestory generally continue into one another, with the windows taking the entire space of the pointed arch. An ambulatory with radiating chapels (chevet) is part of the design (though at the 15th-century choir in Breda added later on). Whereas the cathedrals in Brussels and Antwerp are notable exceptions, the main porch is straight under the single west tower, in French called clocher-porche. Pillar bundle columns (on this side), and frieze of tracery (underneath windows), in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp An alternative type originated with the cathedral of Antwerp: instead of round columns with a capital impost, bundled pillars profiled in the columns continue without interruption through the ribs of vaults and arches ‚Äì a style followed for churches in 's-Hertogenbosch and Leuven. In addition, the pier arches between nave and aisles are exceptionally wide, and the triforium is omitted. Instead, a transom of tracery is placed above the pier arches. This type was followed by other major churches in Antwerp, St. Martin Church in Aalst, and St. Michael's Church in Ghent. Demer Gothic in the Hageland and Campine Gothic are regional variants of Brabantine Gothic in the south-eastern part of the former duchy.The Duchy of Brabant included the area around the city of Halen, a western tip of the present-day circumscription of the Province of Limburg of the Flemish Region. Those styles can be distinguished merely by the use of local rust-brown bricks.Sources mention the west tower's sturdiness as a typical Campine Gothic characteristic. Other sources however, note this feature for Brabantine Gothic as a whole. Brabantine Gothic city halls are built in the shape of gigantic box reliquaries with corner turrets and usually a belfry. The exterior is often profusely decorated. Adaptations in Holland and of Zeeland Many churches in the former Counties of Holland and of Zeeland are built in a style sometimes inaccurately separated as Hollandic and as Zeelandic Gothic. These are in fact Brabantine Gothic style buildings with concessions necessitated by local conditions. Thus (except for Dordrecht), because of the soggy ground, weight was saved by wooden barrel vaults instead of stone vaults and the flying buttresses required for those. In most cases, the walls were made of bricks but cut natural stone was not unusual. Everaert Spoorwater played an important role in spreading Brabantine Gothic into Holland and Zeeland. He perfected a method by which the drawings for large constructions allowed ordering virtually all natural stone elements from quarries on later Belgian territory, then at the destination needing merely their cementing in place. This eliminated storage near the construction site, and the work could be done without the permanent presence of the architect. Renowned examples of Brabantine Gothic architecture In the former Duchy of Brabant Buildings within a named area's outer boundaries are listed, regardless whether the ruler of that area controlled a particular city therein.

One source specifies that 2 columns became erected by (some time between) 1330 and 1340, and that the first of the radiating chapels (a Brabantine characteristic) also 'dates from this first period' (without specifying its end date); it starts the next phase in 1402. Another source states that around 1400 Hendrik van Thienen became de Savoye's successor and then built the first of the southern radiating chapels, and that in 1432 Sulpitus van Vorst completed the (earlier) begun northern radiating chapel:  *Saint Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent, from early 15th century *Large Church or Church of Our Lady in Breda, from 1410, considered the most pure and elegant Brabantine Gothic in the present-day Netherlands *Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels *Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon in Brussels *Saint Martin's Church in Aalst *Large Church or Church of Our Lady in Dordrecht, the present form dates from 1470.

After a few years, in 1454, its chief architect Andries I Keldermans construed the tower at Zierikzee, where dreaded leaning or sagging of the tower (now 62 metres but designed for ca. 130) could wreck the church. This concern led to fully separated edifices, a solution as applied in Mechelen. At both places, in the early 16th century the upper part of the tower became forsaken, not for technical but for financial reasons. The gap with the cathedral was closed upon finishing the construction. That deliberately weak connection had not been made in Zierikzee when the collegiate church burned down, in 1832.

The format establishes a group of characters early on, who become part of a continuous plotline. Commonly, as well as scenes which progress the story, performers may participate in musical numbers and other challenges or games. The action is directed for both performers and audience by writers who develop the plot in response. Whilst some performers may take a break at some point during the event, traditionally some core cast members will participate for the entire duration, going one or two nights without sleep. The sleep deprivation reduces performers to their \\"lizard brain\\" state, where they become too tired to censor themselves, resulting in a unique and euphoric form of theatre. Many audience members stay for the full duration, sharing the sleeplessness with the actors. In Edmonton, Canada, where the concept was originally devised, it is known as a Soap-A-Thon. Soap-A-Thon The Soap-a- thon has most notably been made popular by Canadian improv company Die-Nasty who completed their first 50 hour Soap-A-Thon in 1993 at the Varscona Theatre.

It focused on the events of a selection of characters in a generic ancient imperial Rome setting. It was the last show with a live audience at the Bristol Improv Theatre before it shut its doors due to the Coronavirus pandemic. YT Improvathons The performance format discussed above is not to be confused with the annual event held by the Christian Youth Theatre in the United States.

Background Large land areas in the world are too dry for trees to survive. Although water may be present in the ground, it is often too deep for small trees to develop a root structure to reach. The Groasing Technology employs biomimicrySusan Kraemer, \\"Inventor Uses Biomimicry To Create Dew\\", Cleantechnica.com to solve the problem of growing plants in deserts, eroded areas, badlands and on rocks. The purpose of this technology is to replant such areas, restore the vegetation cover and make them productive with fruit trees and vegetables.

The box's lid is covered by tiny papillae, which create a superhydrophobic surface due to the lotus effect. The lid serves to funnel even the smallest amount of water down siphons into the box's central reservoir.http://dewharvest.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-lotus-leaf-inspired- waterboxx-lid.htmlhttp://www.groasis.com/en/technology/the-different-forms-of- condensation The product functions as a plant incubator, sheltering both a newly planted sapling and the ground around it from the heat of the sun, while providing water for the plant. The lid collects water from rain and nighttime condensation, which is then stored in the bucket. The water-filled reservoir releases small amounts (around 50 ml per day) of water into the ground by a wick to water the tree and to encourage the tree to develop a root structure. The box acts as a shield for the water in the upper ground, and this water then spreads down and out instead of being drawn to the surface and evaporated. Both temperature and humidity beneath and inside the box are more stable night and day than without. As of 2010, the development has taken 7 years at a cost of $7.1 million.Binns, Corey. Invention Awards: A box that keeps plants hydrated in the desert Popular Science, 25 May 2010. Accessed: 6 December 2010. Installation Use of the box initially involves digging a hole in the ground by a human or a machine. One to three plants are planted in the hole, and a cardboard panel is placed around the plants. In dry areas, the soil around the plants is inoculated with mycorrhizae to release nutrients in the soil that would otherwise be chemically inaccessible to the growing plants. A wick is inserted in the bottom of the Groasis which is then lowered over the plants and filled with water. Two lids are put on, funnels inserted and a cap plugs the top lid.A'Hearn, Peter.

History Anabaptist-Mennonite groups began arriving in Belize in the 1950s from Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Hurricane Hattie, which hit Belize hard in 1961, prompted the arrival of numerous Mennonite agencies to provide disaster relief, notably the Beachy Amish Mennonite and the Eastern Mennonite Board of Missions and Charities. In 1964, missionaries Paul and Ella Martin arrived in Belize and, in 1969, the Mennonite Central Committee established the Mennonite Center in Belize City to govern the Mennonite agricultural colonies in the country. The Belize Evangelical Church was formally established in 1973. By 1978, the Belize Evangelical Mennonite Church was established, and there were several dozen colonies in the country, made up mostly of Old Colony Mennonites (Rhinelanders) and Kleingmeinde Mennonites (\\"The Little Brotherhood\\"), and had five congregations and 122 communicant members, including Creoles, Garifuna, Maya, and Mestizos. The Mennonite Central Committee and Mission and Eastern Mennonite Missions who started service in Belize in 1960s were responsible for initiation of the service activities of this church Mennonites were first initiated as their knowledge of German was poor and later Belizeans were also initiated into the service. In 1981, the church has grown to 10 congregations and 425 members. By 2003, there were 425 members and 13 congregations. The Mennonite colonists in Belize made an agreement with the authorities to promote education, agriculture and their beliefs. By 1978, they operated 39 primary schools and two secondary schools. In addition, they cultivated some 5,000 acres, concentrated in Orange Walk District and Cayo District, providing Belize with an influx of dairy products and vegetables. Services The Church‚Äôs services are held in English (official language of Belize), Spanish and Garifuna, or a mixture of these languages. The Jesus Deaf Church, an ecumenical Christian church, is affiliated with the Belize Evangelical Mennonite Church, offering services that are led by a deaf pastor. In Belmopan, an Evangelical Bible church is located at 3840 Ambergris Avenue. Affiliations Within the Caribbean community, the Belize Evangelical Mennonite Church is affiliated with Cuba's Brethren in Christ Missionary Society; the Dominican Republic's Divine Light Mennonite National Council and the Evangelical Mennonite Conference; the Jamaica Mennonite Church; and the Mennonite Church of Trinidad and Tobago.

He served as joint-minister of Edinburgh's High Kirk (1787‚Äì98), as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (1796), and as Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University (1784‚Äì98). A friend and correspondent of Robert Burns and a beneficiary of Walter Scott, his lecture course in Rhetoric and Belles Lettres had a huge influence on the development of English Literature as a discipline in universities. Life Dalkeith parish church St Giles' Cathedral, or High Kirk, Edinburgh Greenfield was the third child, and second son of Captain John Greenfield, R.N. (d.1774) and Grizel Cockburn (dau. of the aged Sir William Cockburn of that Ilk, 2nd Bart., 1662-1751). Baptised at Dalkeith parish church, Midlothian on 9 February 1755, he matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1774, graduating with MA on 17 April 1778, and was almost immediately (though unsuccessfully) nominated as a Professor of Mathematics at Marischal College, Aberdeen. He was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland to Wemyss Parish on 6 September 1781. He then moved to become the first minister of the new St Andrew's Church in the New Town of Edinburgh on 25 November 1784, until he was appointed Minister of St Giles (or High Kirk) of Edinburgh by the Town Council on 21 February, taking up post on 1 April 1787. He held this post as well as the Regius Professorship of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres (among the first University Chairs in English Literature in the world), which he had held in conjunction with Hugh Blair since 1784, and whom he succeeded. He was made Almoner to the King in March 1789. He \\"radically altered the size and structure of the Edinburgh course\\" he took over from Blair, according to Martin Moonie's chapter in Crawford's book. Greenfield had wide interest. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and on 12 April 1784 he read a paper and, later in its Transactions (1788 Vol 1, pp131‚Äì145) he published as an article entitled \\"On the use of negative quantities in the solution of problems by Algebraic Equations\\". (His son, Andrew Rutherfurd, attached a biographical note to his copy of this article, without revealing that the author was his father). Greenfield also delivered lectures in Natural Philosophy, the manuscripts of which are still retained in Edinburgh University Library. Success He was made Doctor of Divinity by Edinburgh on 31 March 1789, was Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and became Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on 19 May 1796. From that session, he sent a letter to King George III, congratulating him on having escaped an assassination attempt, and one to the Prince of Wales, later George IV, congratulating him on his (ill-fated) engagement to Princess Caroline of Brunswick. Robert Burns writes affectionately and admiringly of him in his second Commonplace Book \\"he is a steady, most disinterested friend, without the least affectation, of seeming so; and as a companion, his good sense, his joyous hilarity, his sweetness of manners and modesty, are most engagingly charming.\\"Burns Encyclopedia He married Janet Bervie,daughter of a Kirkcaldy maltman, on 22 November 1782 Disgrace and after Greenfield was disgraced in December 1798. The records of the Presbytery of Edinburgh state that because of \\"certain flagrant reports concerning his conduct... [they] laid him under a sentence of excommunication.\\" Sufficiently serious, he voluntarily resigned his Church and University posts as well as that of King's Almoner. The University of Edinburgh revoked his degrees of M.A. and D.D. There is evidence of a public outcry, \\"a sin peculiarly heinous and offensive in its nature,\\" according to the Presbytery, and a letter by Greenfield resigning and expressing gratitude to his previous colleagues and charges.Sarah Sloane, Gaillet's Scottish rhetoric and its influences Later comment indicated he had been discovered in gay relationship with a student. His name was airbrushed from the recollections of his contemporaries in Scotland. Greenfield fled to Corbridge in Northumberland. He wrote the elegantly written Essays on the Sources of the Pleasures received from Literary Compositions, which he published in 1809.Wm Hamilton, London This seems to be a polished and published version of his Edinburgh lecture course. ; In the same year, Sir Walter Scott introduced him to the publisher John Murray. Scott supposedly asked Murray to keep Greenfield's name secret, as he was hiding from creditors.Quarterly Review.Vol. 1, No 2 (May 1809), accessed 8 December 2010 There is no evidence of Greenfield's further connection with Murray,or with any other publisher. In another instance Scott's letter is quoted and his case described: \\"You cannot but have heard of that very unfortunate man Dr Greenshields [sic] who for a dishonourable or rather infamous cause was obliged to leave Edinburgh where he was long beloved and admired of every human being...\\"Robert Crawford The Scottish Invention of English Literature Greenfield contributed one review to the Quarterly Review under the name of Richardson. It disapproved morally of the novel Am√©lie Mansfield by Mme Cottin. He also assumed the name of Rutherfurd, his wife's mother's name. This circumstance led much literary gossip, including The Kaleidoscope magazine to suspect Greenfield as the author of the Waverley or \\"Scotch\\" novels. Some thought that Scott was not capable of being the author but Greenfield was. Greenfield was a full and visible and respected member of the Scottish literary scene. He died in the North of England on 28 June 1827. Posterity His wife, who had assumed the maiden name of her mother Margaret Rutherford (or Rutherfurd), died on 20 June 1827. His children seemed to have made successful careers or marriages in the law, army and the Church, suggesting the scandal did not affect them much, well concealed under the name of Rutherfurd. Their careers and marriages seemed also to have been based in Scotland, which might indicate that Greenfield had left his family there, the North of England being a common refuge for fugitive Scots, near but beyond the jurisdiction.

The Parai is played entirely with two sticks- Adi kuchi (Tamil:‡ÆÖ‡Æü‡Æø ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø) and Sundu Kuchi (Tamil:‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø). There are three fundamental strokes from which all of the rhythmic patterns are derived; striking the center of the drum with the shorter stick held in the strong/dominant hand; \\"slapping\\" the center of the drum with the long stick held in the weak/off hand; and striking the drum with both sticks, the dominant immediately followed by the off. The short stick (adikuchi) is loosely held between the thumb and three other fingers: index, middle, and ring of the dominant hand. It is held vertically upright, positioned near the lower rim of the drum. The off hand which holds the long stick rests on the upper part of the frame. This stick is positioned at an angle pointed downward. The base of the stick is gripped by the thumb and index fingers and balanced between the middle and ring fingers. The long stick is moved back and forth using the ring finger and thumb respectively Just before the commencement of every performance, drummers will heat the Parai, holding them extremely close to a small bonfire, so that the heat absorbs the moisture in the drum heads and tightens them considerably. After heating, the drums produce a high pitched loud cracking sound when struck. Rhythms *Otthaiyadi () *Thenmangu () *Samiaatam () *Thullal () *Uyirppu () History In Tamil, the word parai means 'to speak' or 'to tell'. It was performed in the courts of Sangam, Chola, and Pandiyan rulers. The drums were used to announce important messages and orders of the great Tamil Kings. In olden days, parai was used for multiple reasons, ranging from warning people about the upcoming war, requesting the civilians to leave the battlefield, announcing victory or defeat, stopping a breach of water body, gathering farmers for farming activities, warning the wild animals about people's presence, during festivals, wedding, celebrations, worship of nature and so on. Parai has been an instrumental part of the people's life.

Organized in 1662, it is the oldest continuously serving Presbyterian church in the United States. History The church was first organized in 1662. Most of its founders came from Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Though there are older churches on Long Island, this congregation has never stopped service. In 1699, a stone church was built on what is now Jamaica Avenue, paid for by tax dollars. In 1702, the congregations of Grace Episcopal and First Reformed split off. A new church was constructed in 1813 near what is now 163rd Street. It was moved, along with a manse built in 1824, in 1920 to the present location at 89-60 164th Street. Two years later, a bronze tablet was erected to mark the 260th anniversary. In 1925, a church house, now known as the Magill Memorial Building, was erected to accommodate the growing church's need for office and classroom space. In 1959, Donald Trump was confirmed here and attended services in his formative years within a then all-white congregation.MJ Lee: God and the Don. In: CNN.com, June 2, 2017. In April 2008, the church celebrated its 345th anniversary. Later that year, the church turned down landmark recognition by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Ministries and community outreach Internal ministries include communications within the church (e.g. newsletter, bulletin, etc.); drama within the church (e.g. Christmas pageants); small group ministries centering on personal interests; Brothers on the Move, the men's ministry; Presbyterian Women; and the Alice Horn Gift Shop, including the Pastor's Book of the Month Club. The church has many community outreach programs, including blood drives, prostate cancer screenings, sponsoring Girl Scouts and Cub Scouts, and running the Bread of Life Food Pantry, which serves the nearly 39% of homes in Queens afflicted by hunger. It also partners with many organizations, including Alcoholics Anonymous, Blood Services of New York City, the Cornell University Extension Program, and the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development. The church also partners with YouthWorks,http://www.youthworks.com/ which allows young people from all over the world to experience the wonderful diversity of culture and worship styles found in Jamaica. Tree of Life Center The Tree of Life Center is an outreach program to economically empower Jamaica, and make individuals in the community self-sufficient.

Background The present 2009 Directive updated the Works Council Directive 94/45/EC, which in the same pattern as now, applied to every firm with over 1000 employees, and at least 150 employees in a different member state. It stipulated that employees must be informed and consulted on matters closely affecting employment of workers over at least two member states, such as the ‚Äòprospective trend of employment, any substantial change in firms‚Äô organisation and production processes and collective redundancies or sales of undertakings.‚ÄôFor cases on the Directive, see C-62/99 Bofrost [2001] ECR I-2579, C-440/00 Kuhne and Nagel [2004] ECR I-787, and C-349/01 Anker [2004] ECR I-6803, all on access to information to set up the Special Negotiating Body. In 2005, the EU Commission issued a draft proposal to update the 1995 Directive,COM (2005) 33 final noting particularly that while 820 European Works Councils existed, that represented merely 36% of the enterprises falling within the scope of the directive and around 60% of employees. It also took the position that works councils as they stood were not ‚Äòup to the task of playing their full role in anticipating and managing change and building up a genuine transnational dialogue between management and labour‚Äô.COM (2005) 33 final, para 5 With that in mind, the 2009 Directive was issued. Provisions The preamble of the Directive explicitly aims for ‚Äòincreasing the proportion of EWCs established‚Äô, ‚Äòensuring the effectiveness of employees‚Äô transnational information and consultation rights‚Äô, and ‚Äòremedying the lack of legal certainty resulting from some of its provisions or the absence of certain provisions, and ensuring that Community legislative instruments on information and consultation of employees are better linked‚Äô. It also emphasises that information must be provided ‚Äòwithout slowing down the decision-making process in undertakings‚Äô.Recital 22 According to article 1(1) the 'purpose of this Directive is to improve the right to information and to consultation of employees in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings.‚Äô Community scale undertakings are defined in article 2(1)(a) as having over 1000 employees in at least two member states. In article 2(1)(g) \\"consultation\\" is defined to mean The procedure for establishing works councils follows on under article 5 from either the initiative of management, or the request of over 100 employees. Once this happens, under article 6 both sides are under a duty to negotiated in good faith to reach agreement about the scope of the works' councils' functions, the composition and number of representatives on the works councils. Representatives have the right to perform their functions as part of their job, and so they do not lose pay for time spent on works council matters. The Directive stipulates that information and consultation in European Works Councils should be integrated with national employee representation bodies. National implementation In the United Kingdom, the relevant regulations are the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999. In Germany, the Europ√§ische- Betriebsr√§te-Gesetz ‚Äì implementing the 1994 Directive ‚Äì is currently under revision due to the 2009 Directive.

The story provides a first-person account of a mother's struggle to provide a good life for her children and husband in 1980s Britain. It was published in 2005. Summary When full-time legal secretary Dawn Annandale notices an advertisement in a magazine which states that attractive girls can earn up to ¬£300 per night by engaging in escort work, her curiosity is piqued. At first, she thinks that the work would be in dissonance to her own life which consists of having six children between the ages of two and twelve, having a nice home in Kent and a husband, Paul. The struggle to maintain a privileged middle class existence led to Dawn's realisation that herself and her husband 'were very probably guilty of trying to live a champagne lifestyle on an orange juice budget.' The author's account of her subsequent actions attempt to explain to the reader that she was motivated by her fervent desire to give to her children a happy and stable beginning in life. From the start of Dawn's marriage, Paul leaves the running of the house and the sorting of finances to Dawn. He assures Dawn that he is happy for her to do what she thinks is best for the family. When she enrols her first child at a private primary school, she feels that this sets a precedent for her other children to be educated up to the same standards. Financial matters are further complicated by the additional costs of after-school clubs, school uniforms and music lessons. Her impecunious situation prompts her to make an appointment with Jimmy, a man in charge of the escort operation. Jimmy comments that Dawn is very different from his other girls. This adds to Dawn's anxiety because she worries that she will not experience financial success. When Jimmy asks her the reasons as to why she is seeking to pursue this form of work, Dawn replies honestly that she is motivated by the fact that she has 'six kids to feed and educate and a mountain of debts to pay.' When Dawn sees her first client, she introduces herself as Elizabeth. Although she is overwhelmed by trepidation, uncertainty and anxiety during her experience, her fears soon dissipate when she visits subsequent clients. Many of the men she sees are exceptionally protective of her in that they give Dawn/ Elizabeth advice on the best means by which to conduct herself so that she can decrease the chances of finding herself in a dangerous situation. She is also struck by how many of her clients are lonely men who feel ignored by their wives. Many of her clients request her on multiple occasions because of her ability to engage in intellectual conversations. When it dawns upon the author how lucrative her newfound position is, she leaves her job as a legal secretary and works as a full-time escort. She joins a new agency and becomes acquainted with Trish, who runs the switchboard. Elizabeth becomes more adept in her role and her confidence increases. When she rings a local radio station which asks listeners to provide an account of what they are doing late at night, Elizabeth reveals the activities in which she has been engaged. She is happy and pleased at the amount of public support she receives. Her comfort level becomes challenged when one of her male friends discovers the double life that she has been leading. Call Me Elizabeth TV production In 2005, ITV brought the television rights to the book. Deborah Moggach was to write the TV adaption. Sequel Call Me Elizabeth was followed in 2007 with Call Me Madam, an account of the author setting up an escort agency.

In June that year a vacancy arose in the City of London constituency when the Liberal MP James Pattison died age 62. A group of leading Liberals from the City met on 16 July and resolved to nominate Duke for the vacancy if he would consent, agreeing that: > \\"impressed with the opinion that the personal character and commercial > experience of the Rt.

Today there are no visible traces left of the castle.  Early history  The archival documented history of the Harz forests around the once independent municipality of Hasserode, that has been part of the borough of Wernigerode since 1907, go well back into the Middle Ages. Originally, this wooded region belonged to an imperial forest before it was enfeoffed by the Holy Roman emperors and German kings to the counts of Wernigerode, first mentioned in 1121, who came from Haimar in the Diocese of Hildesheim. The counts of Wernigerode, like most ruling dynasties, endeavoured to extend their sphere of influence. In the Harz Foreland at the foot of the mountain range called the Huy they had freehold estates in various villages. These villages were, however, under the counts of Regenstein. In a clever move, the Wernigerode counts attempted to bind the subjects of these villages closer to them by granting timber rights in their forests in the Harz to the local farmers. For example, in 1253, there is already mention of the Hadebergeberg (now known as the Heudeberberg) south of the Augustine hermitage of Himmelpforten Abbey, destroyed in 1525. The Regenstein village of Heudeber was granted timber rights in this forest. Other villages were given similar rights by the counts of Wernigerode no later than the mid-14th century in the woods right and left of the Holtemme and in the Dr√§nge valley. As well as Heudeber, the villages of Reddeber, Danstedt, Str√∂beck, Athenstedt, Aspenstedt, Sargstedt and Runstedt also benefited. These parishes, mainly located on the Huy, had certain privileges within a specified area of forest area, for which the expression Achtwort was coined at the beginning of the 15th century. In the circumstance of medieval Germany, the use of this forest area for these village which were approximately 10 to 30 kilometres away from the Harz, was very difficult. In order to protect them and better organize the management of the forest, a base at the foot of Harz was required.  Sources  * Jacobs, Eduard (1882).

The flight was performed under a funded agreement from NASA as the second Dragon demonstration mission in the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The purpose of the COTS program is to develop and demonstrate commercial sources for cargo re-supply of the International Space Station (ISS). The Dragon C2+ spacecraft was the first American vehicle to visit the ISS since the end of the Space Shuttle program. It was also the first commercial spacecraft to rendezvous and berth with another spacecraft. Initially, the objectives of the C2+ mission were to have been accomplished by two separate missions; Dragon C2 would have carried out a fly-by of the ISS, practiced rendezvous maneuvers and communications with the station, before returning to Earth. A second mission, Dragon C3, would have been the first mission to berth with the station. In July 2011, NASA gave tentative approval to combine the objectives of the two missions. In December 2011, NASA formally approved the merger of the COTS 2 and 3 missions into the Dragon C2+ flight. There were several launch delays, the last one occurring on 19 May 2012, due to a launch abort during the last second before liftoff. Dragon C2+ successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on 22 May 2012. During the mission's first three days all of the COTS 2 objectives were successfully completed. The mission's COTS 3 phase began on 25 May when Dragon rendezvoused again with the ISS and then was successfully captured using the Canadarm2. It was berthed to the station later that day, using the robotic arm. Dragon stayed for almost six days during which the astronauts unloaded cargo, and then reloaded Dragon with Earth-bound cargo. On 31 May, Dragon unberthed from the ISS, its capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast and was recovered. All the objectives of the mission were successfully completed, and the Falcon 9-Dragon system became certified to start regular cargo delivery missions to the ISS under the Commercial Resupply Services program.  History  LC-40 on 16 November 2011 during pre-launch processing. NASA and SpaceX signed a contract for COTS cargo resupply services on 18 August 2006. The agreement called for three test-flights, under the COTS phase 1 demonstration program. The first COTS mission, COTS Demo Flight1, was completed successfully on 8 December 2010, when the Dragon capsule was successfully recovered from orbit. Due to the mission's success, SpaceX asked NASA to combine the COTS 2 ISS flyby flight, which would have seen a Dragon spacecraft approach the station but stay about 10 km away from it, and the COTS 3 flight that would berth with the ISS. At a 15 July 2011 meeting, NASA tentatively approved combining the two COTS missions to accelerate the program into the operational supply mission phase in 2012. On 9 December, NASA officially approved the merger of the COTS 2 and 3 missions into the renamed Dragon C2+ flight. The Falcon 9 launch vehicle arrived at SpaceX's Cape Canaveral, Florida facilities at Launch Complex 40 (LC-40) in July 2011. The mission's Dragon spacecraft arrived at the launch site on 23 October 2011. On 1 March 2012, a fueled countdown test called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), was successfully completed for the COTS 2 mission. On 16 April its Flight Readiness Review (FRR) was completed by NASA and stated that a 30 April launch was feasible. Following the review SpaceX announced a launch delay, due to continued flight software testing issues, and the next major mission milestone was the successful Falcon 9 static-fire engine test on 30 April. NASA approved Dragon's flight software on 11 May, solving an issue that had previously been responsible for several launch date postponements. On 17 May, the mission passed its final launch review and the Falcon 9/Dragon were erected on the launch pad in preparation for the launch. The first launch attempt, on 19 May, was aborted at T-00:00:00.5 due to a pressure issue in one of the Falcon 9's engines. The launch window was nearly instantaneous, for fuel-efficiency reasons, leaving little margin for error due to fuel consumption restrictions caused by the extra manoeuvres required to certify the Dragon spaceship before attempting to berth with the ISS. Dragon's launch window could have been longer, but the extra fuel required to catch the ISS would have likely surpassed safety margins, due to the pre-berthing tests.  Original plan  Under the original Dragon testing plan, the C2 and C3 missions would have been flown instead of C2+. C2 would have rendezvoused with the ISS, however it would not have performed the capture and berthing part of the mission. The third test- flight was intended to be Dragon's first mission to berth with the ISS. Following a 15 July 2011 meeting between SpaceX and NASA officials, the COTS 3 mission objectives were tentatively combined with the proposed COTS 2 demonstration flight, due to the Falcon 9's two previously successful launches, and the Space Transportation System's shuttle fleet recently being retired. On 9 December 2011, NASA formally approved the two missions' merger, and set the initial launch date for 7 February 2012. Several delays occurred between December to May 2012, mostly due to SpaceX needing to further test hardware and software. The Dragon C2+ mission successfully launched on 22 May, from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40). It successfully completed all COTS 2 mission objectives, then berthed with the ISS, and completed all COTS 3 mission objectives, before successfully splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, off the California coast on 31 May. Since all COTS objectives were met during the Dragon C2+ flight in May 2012, the need for COTS Demo Flight 3 was eliminated.  Mission timeline   Flight day 1, launch (22 May)  The COTS 2 Falcon 9 successfully launches with the Dragon spacecraft on 22 May 2012. Launch occurred at 03:44 EDT (07:44 UTC) on 22 May 2012. This was the first time a Falcon 9 was launched at night. After lift-off, main engine shut- off occurred at approximately the 180-second mark, and the first stage began to be separated. Following stage separation, the second stage ignited. The Dragon's nose cone was then jettisoned. And at about nine minutes into the flight, the second-stage engine shut-off occurred and separated from the Dragon spacecraft. The Dragon spacecraft successfully deployed its solar arrays at about 13 minutes into the flight. The initial COTS 2 tests began during this flight segment, when Dragon performed a test of its Absolute GPS (AGPS) system, using global positioning system satellites to determine its location. Next, Dragon opened its bay door which housed its grapple fixture and relative navigation sensors, a thermal imager and the LIDAR based DragonEye. After a checkout of these sensors was completed, Dragon demonstrated its ability to abort during an approach, first with a continuous firing of its Draco engines and then with a pulsed firing. A free drift demonstration then began, allowing the spacecraft to float freely without using its thrusters which would normally correct its orbital path.  Flight day 2 (23 May)  On flight day two, Dragon began a series of thruster burns, called \\"height adjustment\\" burn (HA-1), and \\"co-elliptical\\" burn (CE-1). The CE-1 burn changed Dragon's orbit characteristics by placing it into a circular orbit around the Earth. The HA-1 burn raised Dragon's altitude to within a few kilometres below the ISS, in preparation for the next day's rendezvous demonstration.  Flight day 3 (24 May)  Dragon spacecraft seen from the ISS during the fly-under on day three, 24 May 2012. On flight day three, Dragon performed height adjustment burn 2 (HA-2) at 07:58 UTC, to get within about of the ISS, the \\"communication zone.\\" At 08:43 UTC co-elliptical burn 2 (CE-2) raised its orbit to nearly the same plane as the ISS, and brought it to within below the station. During this \\"fly-under,\\" Dragon established communications with the station using its COTS Ultra-high frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Dragon performed a test of its Relative GPS (RGPS) system, which used the relative positions of the spacecraft to the space station to determine its location. Also, using the Crew Command Panel (CCP) on board the Cupola module, the Expedition 31 crew briefly interacted with Dragon, monitoring the fly-under and just before 11:00 UTC sending a command to Dragon to turn on its strobe light. At about 11:25 UTC the Dragon made its closest approach to the ISS. Once the fly-under was completed, Dragon fired its thrusters to begin a loop out in front, above and then behind the station in a racetrack oval pattern at a distance between . The Dragon performed a final burn for the day, at 11:57 UTC, that moved it away from the ISS, and set the spacecraft up for a re-rendezvous with the station the next day. After Dragon cleared the station's vicinity, NASA approved the berthing to occur on day 4, meaning all the original COTS 2 mission requirements were met.  Flight day 4 (25 May)  The Dragon spacecraft being berthed to the International Space Station on day four, 25 May 2012. On flight day four, Dragon performed HA-3 and CE-3 thruster burns to bring it below the station once again. NASA's Mission Control Houston team then gave SpaceX the go ahead to perform another set of burns that brought Dragon to within of the station. Another decision was made at Mission Control Houston, and then Dragon moved to from the station. At this point, the COTS 3 demonstration objectives began. Dragon's DragonEye system demonstrated and confirmed that its position and velocity were accurate by comparing its LIDAR image to its thermal imagers. A series of checkout maneuvers commenced. The SpaceX flight control team in Hawthorne, California, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. It moved from below the station. The crew, using the command panel, then instructed Dragon to retreat, and the spacecraft moved back down to the hold point. This test ensured that Dragon's range to the ISS was accurate, and that the flight control team saw the spacecraft's acceleration and braking perform as expected. It was in a holding pattern at , and once again the Dragon flight team commanded it to approach the station. At the position, the crew commanded the vehicle to hold. Another decision was made in Houston, and Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), a virtual area around the station intended to prevent collision with the orbiting complex. Two additional and non-planned holds occurred: one at to further verify LIDAR; and finally one by SpaceX at to re-configure the LIDARs. Stray reflections from the JAXA JEM module's External Facility (EF) caused interference with the LIDAR; SpaceX decided to narrow the LIDAR's field-of- view to eliminate the reflections. Dragon proceeded to a position from the station and automatically came to a stop for a hold. Another decision was made, and then Dragon proceeded to the capture point position at . A final decision was made, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were go to capture Dragon. At that point, from the Cupola module, Expedition 31 crew member Don Pettit used the station's Mobile Servicing System (Canadarm2) to reach out and grapple the Dragon spacecraft at 13:56 UTC over Western Australia. Upon capture, Pettit jokingly told ISS CAPCOM Megan McArthur, \\"Looks like we got us a Dragon by the tail. We're thinking this sim went really well, we're ready to turn it around and do it for real.\\" Pettit, with the help of fellow crewmember Andr√© Kuipers, guided and then berthed Dragon to the Harmony module's Earth-facing Common Berthing Mechanism at 16:02 UTC.  Flight day 5 and remainder of mission (26 to 31 May)  Don Pettit opening Dragon's hatch on 26 May. On flight day five, after evaluating air quality inside Dragon, the crew opened the hatch between Dragon and the station at 05:53 EDT (09:53 UTC). Pettit and Russian cosmonaut and station commander Oleg Kononenko were the first crew members to enter the Dragon. They wore protective goggles and breathing masks as they performed further tests to make sure the atmosphere inside the capsule was safe, which it was, though Pettit noted that \\"the inside smells like a brand new car.\\" Dragon spent approximately six days berthed to the space station, allowing astronauts time to unload its cargo. They then reloaded it with Earth-bound cargo. On 27 May, while being controlled by Mission Control Houston, Dextre was used to survey Dragon's trunk. Recovery of the COTS 2 Dragon on 31 May. On its final day at the station, 31 May, the crew unberthed Dragon from Harmony using the Canadarm2 at 05:49 EDT (09:49 UTC). The arm moved Dragon about away from the station and released it. Dragon then performed a series of engine burns that placed it on a trajectory to take it away from the vicinity of the station. Mission Control Houston then confirmed that Dragon was on a safe path away from the complex. SpaceX instructed Dragon to close its bay door and approximately four hours after Dragon left the station, it began to conduct its nine-minute-long deorbit burn. The Dragon capsule jettisoned its trunk and began to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. Its heatshield protected it during most of the re-entry and when low enough in altitude its two drogue parachutes were deployed, followed by its three main parachutes. The Dragon capsule splashed down into the Pacific Ocean about from the Baja Peninsula at approximately 11:42 EDT (15:42 UTC) and was recovered by a small fleet of recovery vessels from the contractor hired by SpaceX, American Marine.  Capsule journey post-mission  On 5 June, the Dragon capsule arrived at the Port of Los Angeles and was transported by truck to McGregor, Texas. There its toxic maneuvering propellent was removed and on 13 June its cargo was transferred into NASA's possession. The cargo was then transported to the Johnson Space Center in Houston for further processing. On 18 July 2012, the COTS 2 Dragon was temporarily displayed to an invited audience inside a tent, in front of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. building. On 7 September 2012, Steve Jurvetson, a member on the board of directors at SpaceX, reported that the C2+ capsule was undergoing post-flight analysis back in McGregor. Later in 2012 the Dragon capsule was expected to be transported back to Hawthorne, California. During the post-flight press conference, the CEO and CTO of SpaceX Elon Musk stated that there are no definitive plans for the capsule but that he would like to see it taken on a tour around the United States. The capsule was displayed at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California from 11 to 13 June. The historic Dragon C2+ capsule was ultimately placed on permanent display hanging from the ceiling at SpaceX headquarters. On 23 August 2012, NASA announced that SpaceX and their Falcon 9-Dragon system was certified to begin their cargo delivery contract. The $1.6 billion contract calls for at least 12 resupply missions. The first of those flights was launched on 7 October 2012.  Payload  The interior of the Dragon spacecraft on 26 May, showing some of the delivered cargo. The pressurized section carried of cargo to the ISS, which included food, water, clothing, cargo bags, computer hardware, the NanoRacks Module 9 (student experiments and scientific gear) and other miscellaneous cargo. No unpressurized cargo was delivered on this mission. An unannounced addition to the cargo manifest, made public after the launch, was a small canister, affixed to the second stage's top, containing the 1-gram ash remains of over 300 people including Project Mercury Astronaut Gordon Cooper, and James Doohan, the actor who played Scotty on the television show Star Trek in the 1960s. The remains were flown semi-secretly by Celestis, a company that has flown burial canisters in the past on SpaceX's Falcon 1 launch vehicle. The second stage and the burial canister remained in the initial orbit Dragon C2+ was inserted to, and burned up in the Earth's atmosphere a month later.http://www.heavens- above.com/SatInfo.aspx?satid=38349‚™´=0&lng;=0&alt;=0&tz;=UCT Some of the returned cargo is seen in McGregor, Texas on 13 June 2012. On its return to Earth, Dragon brought back worth of pressurized cargo back to Earth; the cargo included experiment samples, experiment hardware, ISS' systems hardware and Extravehicular Mobility Unit hardware. One of the experiments returned by Dragon was the Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment (SHERE) administered by NASA's Glenn Research Center. SHERE investigated rotational stress effects on polymer fluids. Items from SHERE included a toolbox, fluid modules, stowage trays, cables and a keyboard, and science data recordings. Another experiment returning with Dragon was the Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA), and the Combustion Integrated Rack-Fluids and Combustion Facility (CIR). The return flight was planned to carry Another experiment returning at the end of this mission was the Material Science Research Rack (MSRR), which investigated microgravity experiments on aluminum-alloy rods. Returning from MSRR were cartridges from thermal and vacuum investigations done on metal rods in the SETA-2 and the MSL-CETSOL and MICAST studies. Originally, SpaceX also intended to launch two secondary payload satellites from the Dragon sometime in the first 72 hours after launch; however, on 28 December 2011, SpaceX and Orbcomm announced a revised schedule that dropped the satellite deployment from the Dragon C2+ flight plan.  Delays  COTS Demo Flight 2 was to take place as early as 2010, but was delayed by internal SpaceX issues; and then in 2011 by NASA issues. As planned on the manifests, COTS 2 was to fly in June 2011. It was delayed to late 2011, and then followed by further delay by the failure of the Russian Progress 44 cargo resupply vessel in August; this incident could have forced the ISS to be temporarily abandoned in mid-November. Another delay was caused due to the berthing procedure which requires two ISS personnel to be trained and available for the procedure; in early December 2011 only one person was trained to berth the Dragon. The launch date moved as follows: 6 June 2011, 8 October 30 November and 19 December; and 7 January 2012, 30 April, and 7 May. With a busy launch schedule at Cape Canaveral, and with other missions to the ISS, NASA and SpaceX did not announce a new date until mid-March for a 30 April launch. More testing was required by SpaceX for the computer code that controlled berthing, causing another delay to be announced on 23 April, delaying the launch to 7 May at 09:38 EDT (13:38 UTC). A further delay was announced by NASA, pushing the launch to sometime in May. On 4 May, the new targeted launch date was set for 19 May at 04:55 EDT/08:55 UTC. The launch proceeded nominally but was automatically aborted at T‚àí00:00:00.5 when pressure in engine number 5 rose to unacceptable limits. After making repairs, the launch date was set for 22 May at 03:44 EDT (07:44 UTC), with a secondary backup date of 23 May at 03:22 EDT (07:22 UTC) if a longer delay became necessary.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands at a distance from the village, close to West Bergholt Hall. History Excavation has shown that the oldest part of the church is Anglo-Saxon, its north wall dating from about 1000. At this time there was an apse at the east end, but this was later converted into a square-ended chancel. The chancel was extended in about 1300. During the 14th century the south aisle with its three-bay arcade was added. When the bellcote was added in two phases during the medieval era, timber originally from the west end of the church, was used in its construction. During the following centuries there was a population shift, and by the late 19th century most people were living at a distance from the church. Due to this, and because the fabric of the church had deteriorated, it was decided to build a new church, also dedicated to Saint Mary, nearer to its congregation. This was dedicated on 12 August 1904. The old church was declared redundant in 1975 and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust the following year. Queen Elizabeth I had to step in twice to sort out problems with the village vicars. The first troublesome vicar was Reverend Edmund Tarrell, who was noted for spending too much time in the public houses and not enough time in the Church.

Later in 1581 the it was reported to the Queen that the village's vicar, Reverend Richard Kyrby, refused to conduct the service in English after the introduction of her new Prayer Book, which he claimed should remain in Latin. Sixteen years later the Queen stepped in and had him removed. In 1650, Reverend Gregory Holland was called before the Committee for Scandalous Ministers for preaching Royalist sermons during the Civil War, along with drunkenness and swearing in Church. The result of this hearing was that he was allowed to continue in his post as vicar at Bergholt, but that the parishioners elect him a curate, who would pay him the majority of his stipend. It was not only the vicars that were in trouble, but in 1556 a member of the parish, Agrees George, was out of favour with Queen Mary, for refusing to attend church until the service was no longer conducted in the Roman Catholic tradition.J.E.Oxley, The Reformation in Essex: to the Death of Mary, New York: Barnes and Noble (1965) She was then tried before the Bishop of London, Reverend Edmund Bonner, along with 12 others.

James I's Royal Coat in St Mary's Church Later on, in order to remind all the villagers who was king, King James I had his royal coat of arms painted in the Church. This coat of arms can still be seen to this day if one stands in the gallery and looks towards the altar. The motto on the arms reads \\"Exurgat Deus Dissipenter Ininice\\", this is the opening line of Psalm 68Psalm 68 (Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered). Opposite James' arms is a set of Hanoverian arms acquired in 1816.R.Tricker: St Mary's Old Church, The Churches Conservation Trust (1998), pg.9 Architecture The church is constructed in indurated conglomerate and has tiled roofs. The porch is of timber on a brick plinth. Romanesque carved stones have been re-used in the walls of the present church. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a south aisle and a south porch, a chancel, and a bellcote at the west end. The windows in the chancel have Y-tracery, while the tracery in the windows of the south aisle is curvilinear. Internally the roof is supported by massive tie-beams, and the ceilings are plastered. At the west end is a gallery on two Ionic columns, with a panelled front and an entablature with triglyphi. In the southeast of the aisle is a piscina with a trefoil head. The font consists of a cylindrical bowl on a square stem. There is also a royal coat of arms from the Jacobean era.

Published on 15 October 2009, it is a mixture of the steampunk, alternative history and thriller genres. It is set in a world in which France won the Napoleonic Wars and invaded Britain, and in which the world is populated mostly by anthropomorphic animals. The book follows a British anthropomorphic badger, Detective Inspector Archie LeBrock of Scotland Yard, investigating a murder which leads him to visit Paris in order to solve the crime, which itself leads him to uncover a political conspiracy. Publication history Development Talbot writes in his book that Grandville is inspired by the work of Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard, who worked under the name J.J. Grandville, and Albert Robida. He states he is also inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Rupert Bear and Quentin Tarantino. References are made to them in the book. For example, there is a building called \\"Robida Tower\\" and an early scene set in England takes place in a village called \\"Nutwood\\", the setting of the Rupert Bear stories. Grandville makes several references to modern day political events. There are references to the War on Terror, weapons of mass destruction and the September 11 attacks. There are also references to other works, such as The Adventures of Tintin. Plot Setting Grandville is set in a steampunk world, featuring steam-powered motor vehicles, air transport, robots (known as \\"Automatons\\") and televisions. In this world, Britain lost the Napoleonic War and was invaded by France, and the British Royal Family were guillotined. Britain was later given independence from the French Empire following \\"a prolonged campaign of civil disobedience and anarchist bombings.\\"Talbot, p. 17 Following independence, Britain became \\"The Socialist Republic of Britain\\". 23 years later, by which time the English is only spoken in rural communities, Britain is linked to the French Empire by the Channel railway bridge, and Paris is the biggest city in the world. The vast population in Grandville are anthropomorphic animals. Humans do exist, however. Having evolved in Angoul√™me, they are referred to by the French as \\"doughfaces\\". This is most likely because compared to animal facial features, human faces appear as pale and smooth, reminiscent of the dough substances used to make bread. Having never gained citizens' rights, and are considered menial workers. They are not allowed passports and so have never made it to Britain.Talbot, p. 19 Story The book begins with a chase in the streets of Paris, also known as Grandville, in which British diplomat Raymond Leigh-Otter (an otter) escapes from a group of assassins. The action then cuts to Leigh-Otter's house, in which he is found shot dead and the local police are inspecting the body. Detective Inspector Archie LeBrock of Scotland Yard, a large, heavily built badger,The word \\"brock\\" in fact means \\"badger\\". arrives with his assistant, Detective Roderick Ratzi (a rat), and deduces that Leigh-Otter was in fact murdered, after LeBrock notices that Leigh-Otter is holding the gun in his right paw when in fact he is left-handed. Thus, they go to Paris in order to investigate. After LeBrock and Ratzi check into their hotel, they learn that Leigh-Otter often met up with a female guest, Coco (a very attractive cat), the dresser for music hall star Sarah Blairow (a badger). After further investigation they learn that others have also committed suicide, including Coco. As LeBrock goes to meet Sarah, he finds that some assassins have come to kill her. LeBrock gets rid of them and learns that they are working for an organisation called \\"The Knights of Lyon\\". LeBrock tells Sarah to go into hiding while he and Ratzi try to solve the case. While LeBrock attempts to find more information by interviewing the British ambassador, Honourable Citizen Turtell (a tortoise), Ratzi learns the Knights of Lyon are a medieval religious cult possibly connected to the Knights Templar. They visit the Robida Tower ground zero site, which had been bombed by British anarchists, causing tension between Britain and France. Two assassins approach LeBrock, who makes his way to a Turkish bath. LeBrock stops them and learns that the assassins do not know who they are working for, knowing them only as \\"The Knights\\". LeBrock kills them. Ratzi investigates another of the suicides, that of Professor Tope (a mole), pioneer of automaton engineering. After talking to his son, they learn he had an assistant called Snowy Milou (white Wire Fox Terrier). After searching Tope's old lab, LeBrock receives a telephone call from Sarah asking him to visit, because she is worried about her safety. She seduces LeBrock after he arrives and the two make love. The next day, LeBrock learns that Milou has become an opium addict and drug dealer. Ratzi uncovers a photograph which features Tope and several other public figures: Jean-Marie Lapin (a rabbit), a far-right nationalist politician and now Prime Minister who came to power following the bombing of Robida Tower, promising a \\"War on Terror\\"; Madame Krupp (a wombat), an arms manufacturer and newspaper owner; the Archbishop of Paris (a chimpanzee); Reinhardt (a rhinoceros) the Minister for War; and Hyen (a hyena), Chief of Police and Secret Service. LeBrock believes they are the Knights of Lyon and goes to investigate the Archbishop. LeBrock meets up with Milou and learns from him the whereabouts of the Archbishop. LeBrock and Ratzi capture the Archbishop, tie him to a chair and threaten to kill him by setting fire to him. LeBrock deduces that the attack on Robida Tower was organised by the Archbishop and the other Knights (with the help of Tope), who used the British anarchists as scapegoats. Under pressure, the Archbishop tells them that they did it because they believed they could protect French society from decadency and atheism by uniting them against a common enemy. An attempt to unite the people by having a war in French Indo-China had failed, so the Knights began to spread stories of a British super-bomb aimed at Paris. Their final plan is to launch a skyship from Krupp's estate and fly it into the Paris Opera House, where thousands will be watching the Trans-Empire Song Contest. Afterwards, LeBrock sets the Archbishop on fire, killing him. Outside, LeBrock tells Ratzi that he believes that Leigh-Otter was not a diplomat, but a member of the British Secret Service trying to stop the Knights' plan. As LeBrock and Ratzi arrive back at the hotel, they receive a message from Sarah saying that she is in danger. The two arrive at her hideout to find she is being held captive by the assassins. During a shoot-out, Sarah is killed and Ratzi badly injured. The following morning, LeBrock asks a human bellboy at the hotel to collect some things for him - things he will use to make bombs. LeBrock makes his way to the Krupp estate, where the Knights are preparing for the attack on the Opera House. LeBrock sets off his bombs and shoots Krupp, Hyen, Lapin and Reinhardt. Krupp's dying words, to LeBrock, are that the Knights were loyal to the Emperor. He realises that they are not \\"The Knights of Lyons\\", but \\"The Knights of The Lion\\", the lion being Emperor Napoleon XII, the head of state. LeBrock is hit over the head with a chair by Reinhardt, who was not dead but only injured. Reinhardt makes his way to the skyship and prepares to leave. LeBrock follows him and grabs hold of the skyship as it takes off. Not seeing LeBrock, Reinhardt sets the skyship's course and prepares to jump out. As he opens the door, LeBrock jumps in. Reinhardt charges at him, but falls out of the door. As he falls, LeBrock shoots him dead. LeBrock then changes the skyship's course, crashing it into Napoleon's palace. The next day the public learns the truth about the Knights and the attack on Robida Tower, with some wondering if a revolution might happen following the news. LeBrock meets up again with Ratzi in hospital. Reception Grandville has received positive reviews. Ryan Agee from The Skinny gave Grandville four out of five stars, writing: \\"Corny puns abound, but this is a stunningly well drawn book with a compelling mystery, and a great detective team at heart. Great stuff.\\" Neel Mukherjee in The Times was also positive saying: \\"It's a playful, allusive book in which there's a witty touch or deliciously knowing in-joke on almost every page: the French press whipping up Anglophobia; LeBrock's Holmes-like unpacking of apparently innocent signs, which yield vital information, when he makes his first appearance; the drug-addled Milou/Snowy, dreaming of plotlines of Tintin books in his opium-induced stupors. The numerous fight sequences are simply cracking, especially the beautifully rendered sprays of blood and, throughout, the glossy gorgeousness fills your eyes.\\" Rich Johnston from Bleeding Cool wrote that: \\"I love this comic. It's big, bold, brash, insanely detailed and has badgers torturing frogs. There are steam powered carriages and robots, gratuitous violence, big explosions, lots of kicking, a decent ending and Inspector LeBrock finding himself a long, long way from Wind In the Willows. It can be appreciated on so many levels and with so many potential fanbases basically performing bukkake upon the pages, it should appeal to a lot of people. even those who have a problem with a talking snobby French fish butler with legs. Also, don't try to work out the evolutionary timelines. It will just mess with your head. But do enjoy.\\" Joe McCulloch from The Savage Critics was less positive however, writing: \\"This doesn't automatically lend itself to a tremendous amount of depth, frankly, and the somewhat stale, vengeful nature of Talbot's plot leaves it teetering on the edge of embarrassing-silly instead of fun-silly.\\" Notes References  * External links *The Grandville homepage at Bryan Talbot's official website *Bryan Talbot explains his artwork on Grandville, in Italian and English Category:2009 graphic novels Category:2009 comics debuts Category:Alternate history comics Category:British graphic novels Category:Comics about animals Category:Comics by Bryan Talbot Category:Dark Horse Comics graphic novels Category:Science fiction comics Category:Steampunk comics Category:Jonathan Cape books ","title":"Grandville (graphic novel)"},{"id":"29903090","text":"Alfred P.

Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô and ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô.

He stayed in Ottoman prison until 1901. After his release he applied as a teacher in the town of Prilep, but was unsuccessful due to his times in prison previously.

Early life and marriage Catherine Hall was born near Birmingham in 1690, the daughter of poor parents. At the age of 16, she obtained employment as a servant within the household of a Warwickshire farmer named Hayes. The son of this household was 21-year-old John Hayes, who worked as a carpenter, and who soon fell in love with her. Within a year of their acquaintance, the two were married.The Giant Book of World Famous Murders p. 135 Relocation to London and murder Several years into their marriage, the couple moved to London and set up a small shop in Oxford Road, Tyburn, while renting lodgings. Hayes also became a successful pawnbroker, and his wife would bear 12 children. Towards the end of 1725, two men named Thomas Wood and Thomas Billings lodged with the couple.The Giant Book of World Famous Murders p. 136 Having been promiscuous since her mid- teens, Hayes began conducting affairs with both men, and the trio soon decided to kill John Hayes. On 1 March 1726, they persuaded him to partake in a drinking contest, then killed him once he was intoxicated. The trio then dismembered Hayes's body,The Giant Book of World Famous Murders p. 139 subsequently discarding many of his body parts in a pond at Marylebone. The head was cast into the River Thames and was found the next day. It was displayed in the churchyard of St Margaret's, Westminster, for several days, which resulted in John Hayes being identified. On 24 March, the trunk and limbs were discovered. Catherine Hayes and Billings had meanwhile been arrested on a warrant. Wood was captured shortly afterwards, and confessed. Billings then admitted his complicity, but Hayes denied all knowledge of the murder. At the trial, Hayes pleaded 'not guilty', but was convicted of petty treason, and sentenced to be burned at the stake. Wood and Billings were sentenced to be hanged. The case excited much popular attention, and many noblemen and gentlemen attended the trial. Execution Before 9 May, the day fixed for the execution, Wood died in Newgate Prison. Hayes unsuccessfully tried to poison herself. On 9 May, she was tied to a stake at Tyburn with a halter affixed round her neck. One early report stated that \\"the executioner was foiled in an endeavour to strangle her by the burning of the rope, and the woman was finally killed by a piece of wood which was thrown at her head and dashed out her brains\\". Later it was stated that Hayes was \\"the last woman in England to be burnt alive for petty treason (though the burning of women's bodies after execution continued until 1790)\\".Available in print and online for subscribers. Billings was hanged in chains in Marylebone Fields. Ballads were written about Hayes' crime, and a correspondent of the London Journal compared the murder of John Hayes to the play Arden of Feversham. William Makepeace Thackeray based his story of Catherine, which first appeared in Fraser's Magazine 1839‚Äì40, on the career of Catherine Hayes.

She was the regent of Mantua during the War of the Spanish Succession. Life Anna Isabella Gonzaga was the daughter of Ferrante III Gonzaga, Duke of Guastalla, and Margherita d'Este (1619‚Äì1692), daughter of Alfonso III d'Este, Duke of Modena. As the eldest of two daughters, she was the heir of the Duchy of Guastalla and Luzzara Reggiolo, areas which had long been a source of conflict between the two Gonzaga lines: the Gonzagas of Guastalla and the Gonzagas of Mantua. In 1671, she was married to Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga. The marriage was arranged by her aunt, the empress dowager Eleanor Gonzaga, and the purpose was to unite the two Gonzaga lines. The marriage was childless. In 1678, her father died, and her rights to Guastalla was challenged by Don Vincenzo Gonzaga, who married her sister Anna Maria Vittoria and proclaimed himself Duke of Guastalla. Mantua protested, after which Spain intervened and threatened Mantua. In 1691, Spain attacked Mantua itself, and Ferdinando fled to Venice with his ministers. Anna Isabella served as regent in his absence, assisted by her mother-in-law, the Imperial representative Marquis Obizzi and some advisers. She managed to calm the frightened public and successfully arranged for the defense of Mantua against Spain. She also successfully handled some peace negotiations with Spain between the Spanish governor in Milan and the viceroy of Naples. In 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duchy of Mantua was attacked by Imperiali who wished to conquer the areas of Luzzara and Cocoon. Ferdinando fled and left Anna Isabella to handle the situation as regent. During her second regency, she was assisted by Mr de Liesse. She appointed the commanders to handledto defense of Luzzara and Cocoon and issued negotiations for foreign protection of Sabbioneta.

Another development was his work on the ballooning transformation, which describes the motion of plasma in toroidal (donut) configurations, which are used in the fusion field. Taylor has also made contributions to the theory of the Earth's Dynamo, including the Taylor constraint.Taylor, J.

Upon graduation, he joined the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, and in 1962 moved to the Culham Laboratory, where he became Chief Physicist. He held several other positions during this period, including the Commonwealth Fund Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley in 1959 to 1960, the Institute for Advanced Study in 1969, 1973 and 1980‚Äì81, and finally took the position of Fondren Professor of Plasma Theory at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989. Taylor is still actively involved in fusion science, working with Culham laboratory and Oxford University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1970.  Honors and awards  Taylor won the Institute of Physics's James Clerk Maxwell Medal and Prize in 1971, and the Max Born Medal and Prize in 1979. He then went on to win the American Physical Society's James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics in 1999. Taylor initiated the study of chaos in magnetic surfaces, developing several contributions to chaos theory and introducing the \\"standard map\\" (or Chirikov‚ÄìTaylor map). He studied 2D-plasmas, demonstrating the inherent Bohm diffusion which had been noticed in magnetic bottles since the 1950s.

Considered one of the most beautiful women of her time, after the death of her first husband she was regent of San Martino all‚ÄôArgine, Isola Dovarese, Rivarolo and Commessaggio during 1605‚Äì1613 due to her eldest son's minority. Her disastrous second marriage with a distant cousin 18 years younger than her became the cause of an Inquisition process, which was initiated over her at the request of the relatives of her second husband and culminated in her complete rehabilitation. She played a fatal role in the extinction of the main branch of the House of Gonzaga, which was the beginning of the War of the Mantuan Succession. Life Family Born in Novellara in 1576, Isabella was eighth of the thirteenth children of Alfonso I Gonzaga, Count of Novellara and Bagnolo and Vittoria di Capua, member of one of the most rich and powerful families in the Kingdom of Naples. Her paternal grandparents were Alessandro I Gonzaga, Count of Novellara and Bagnolo and Costanza da Correggio, and her maternal grandparents were Giovanni Tommaso di Capua, Marquis della Torre di Francolise and Faustina Colonna, member of the Colonna branch of the Dukes of Zagarolo. First marriage and Regency In 1594 Isabella married with Ferrante Gonzaga, cadet member of the Gonzaga branch of Sabionetta-Bozzolo, Lord of San Martino all‚ÄôArgine, Isola Dovarese, Rivarolo and Commessaggio and General of the Army of the Kingdom of Spain. They had seven (or eight) children: * Scipione (1595 ‚Äì Bozzolo, 12 May 1670), Lord of San Martino all‚ÄôArgine, Isola Dovarese, Rivarolo and Commessaggio since 1605, 2nd Prince of Bozzolo (since 23 June 1609), Marquis of Ostiano, titular Duke of Sabbioneta (since 1636), Marquis d‚ÄôIncisa during 1652‚Äì1669 (when the domain was sold to Trotti Bentivoglio). * Alfonso (1596 ‚Äì 1669), Marquis of Pomaro. * Carlo (1597 ‚Äì 24 April 1637), Abbot Comendador of Lucedio, Governor of Bozzolo during 1631‚Äì1636. * Luigi (1599 ‚Äì 18 December 1660), Imperial General and Governor of Raab; married with Princess Isabella Francesca de Ligne, a member of the House of Arenberg. * Camillo (1600 ‚Äì Spalato, 1658), Patrizio Veneto, General of Artillery in the Venetian armt, Commandant of the Mantovan army since 1652 , Governor of Monferrato since 1652, Governor General of the Venetian army in Dalmatia. * Isabella (1601 ‚Äì ?), a nun. * Annibale (1602 ‚Äì 2 August 1668), Governor of Giavarino, President of the War Council of Emperor Ferdinand III, Marshall of the court of Empress Eleonora, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece since 1657; married firstly with Hedwig Maria of Saxe-Lauenburg and secondly Barbara Csaky de Koeroeszegh et Adorjan. * (probably illegitimate) Federigo, Colonel of the Imperial Army, Imperial Fieldmarshal in Hungary since 1595, Knight of the Order of the Redeemer since 1614. In February 1605, Isabella's husband died. Because her oldest son was still a minor, she became in regent of his domains, who included the Lordships of San Martino all‚ÄôArgine, Isola Dovarese, Rivarolo and Commessaggio. In 1609, she also became in the regent of the Principality of Bozzolo, the Lordship of Rivarolo di Fuori and the County of Pomponesco when her still underage son inherited this domains from his paternal uncle Giulio Cesare Gonzaga. In historiography, the period of Isabella's regency is assessed by contemporaries as a positive one. Among her achievements were the establishment of an archive and a public notary chamber, which has made it possible to improve the judicial system. Thanks to Isabella's actions, feuds under her government quickly coped with the consequences of the devastating flood of 1609. Despite being completely involved in the government of her eldest son's domains, Isabella also cared for the future of her younger children: Alfonso entered the service of an influential relative, Charles III, Duke of Nevers and Rethel (who later became in Duke of Mantua and Monferrato), from whom he received the title of Marquis of Pomaro. Carlo followed a church career and, after studying at the University of Salamanca, took his vows as monks and headed the Abbey of Lucedio. Luigi, Camillo, Annibale and Federigo all followed a military career and rose to high ranks. Her only daughter and namesake, Isabella, became a nun. In 1613, her oldest son Scipione finally attained his legal majority and took the government of his domains; after this Isabella retired to San Martino near Mantua. Second marriage In 1615 Cardinal Vincenzo Gonzaga ‚Äîyounger brother of Ferdinando I, Duke of Mantua and Monferrat‚Äî, settled in the castle of Gazzuolo near San Martino. Despite the education and upbringing received from the Jesuits, the 21-years-old prince had a very dissolute behavior, for which he was removed from the Ducal court. Once he knew that close to him lives a middle-aged cousin once considered one of the first Italian beauties, he decided to pay her a visit: it turned out that the 39-years-old Isabella, mother of eight children, was still beautiful and seductive. Vincenzo fell in love with her, but she refused his advances; then he proposed to her. In August 1616 they secretly married in the chapel of the San Martino palace. Vincenzo asked Pope Paul V his release from his ecclesiastical vows. On 5 September of that year, his renounce of the cardinalate received an official approval. Ferdinando I was against this wedding, as he expected to influence through his younger brother's ecclesiastical status the policy of the Holy See in favor of the House of Gonzaga. The Duke turned to Bishop of Mantua with a request to declare the marriage invalid, in order to return Vincenzo to the cardinalate; his position was shared by his wife Catherine de' Medici, who even tried to convince her mother Christina of Lorraine to obtain the support of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in this matter. At first Vincenzo desperately resisted, but when he was banished to Goito and deprived of a number of material advantages, he broke down, and in December 1616 agreed with his older brother's demands to had his marriage with Isabella annulled. Isabella was kept under surveillance for some time in Gazzuolo, but when it was confirmed that she wasn't pregnant, she was allowed to return to San Martino. However, the annulment of her marriage with Vincenzo turned out to be very difficult. Ferdinando I, using the help of his wife's cousin, Queen Marie of France, received the conclusion of the Sorbonne professors about the possible annulment of the marriage because of the close relationship of the couple; however, this wasn't enough. In Mantua itself, members of the Sabionetta and Novellara branches of the House of Gonzaga spoke out against the divorce. Ferdinando I, childless in his marriage, understood that his younger brother was his heir, and wanted that Vincenzo marry soon to secure the survival of the dynasty; so, after an unsuccessful attempt to poison Isabella, the Duke accused her of witchcraft. The accusations provoked the beginning of the inquisition process, which was opened in the diocese of Mantua in 1622. There appeared supposed \\"witnesses\\" who said that they saw the Dowager Lady of San Martino all‚ÄôArgine using magical potions. Isabella soon understood that with a witch trial in Mantua she had no chance to save her life, moreover when the accusation of witchcraft was supported even by her husband. In 1623, she fled to Rome and appealed her case to the Supreme Inquisition. Thus, a new process was initiated, which was approved by the new Pope Urban VIII. Ferdinando I vainly insisted on conducting the inquisition process in Mantua. Isabella, at the insistence of the Duke, was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. But soon, after a thorough investigation, she was cleared of all charges of witchcraft. All the \\"witnesses\\" were summoned to Rome, and once there, they recanted from their testimonies. During January and May 1624, she was fully rehabilitated. The next attempt of the Duke and her husband to kill her, having sent hired killers, also failed. In October 1626 Vincenzo became in the new Duke of Mantua and Montferrat under the name of Vincenzo II. Although the couple lived separately, they were still legally married, so Isabella was given the title of Duchess consort of Mantua and Montferrat. This news caught her in Rome. In April 1627, the Holy See confirmed the validity of the marriage of Isabella and Vincenzo II. In addition, she raised the issue of the material compensation for damages caused by her husband and his relatives, as well as her recognition as Duchess. In December 1627, Isabella was widowed for the second time. With the death of her childless husband, the main line of the House of Gonzaga became extinct, and began the War of the Mantuan Succession.

History It came into being in 1931 in the shape of Anglo Vernacular classes. It was raised to Anglo Vernacular School in 1937 and later upgraded to high school in April 1944. It is situated in the east side of the Diplo town. From the very beginning till September 1972; it was controlled by District Council Tharparkar and then the control was taken by the Provincial Government. Diplo Town stands at the farther southern end of Desert sub- division. The nearest railway station was Naukot, which was about 70 km. far from Diplo Town in the north. Runn Kutch is only 20 km. from Diplo Town in the South. Diplo is linked with Naukot, Mithi, and Kaloi and Badin with Roads. Prior to 1990 there was no metalled road in Diplo. Only Katcha routes were linked the Naukot. Mithi, Badin, Kaloi. As the town is amid big sand dunes, the journey was very tedious, expensive and time waste/consuming. The population of Diplo town is about 10,000. In 1972 sixty percent of the population is the Muslims and the rest are Hindus. Memons were in majority in the Town. Memon community is greatly inclined towards Education. Before 1931, in absence of facilities for Secondary Education at Diplo Town, some student from Memon Community went to far off places Tando Bago, Mirpurkhas to receive Education. As a matter of facts, they became a source of inspiration for others to educate their children. From among the Memon community, Late Ghulam Mohammad S/O Sahib Dino, Late Saeen Haji Abu Talib, Late Haji Bhale Dino and Qazi Ali Muhammad Rose to the occasion and launched a systematic campaign to get Anglo Vernacular (A.V) classes opened in Diplo Town. They kept the ball rolling and get A.V School in 1937. Their philanthropic nature prompted them not to drop the thread, so they kept their efforts a pace to see it a high school. In early forties, Qazi Ahmed Muhammad helped them in their efforts. In those days it was not easy to get a high school for a far-flung place like Diplo, but their tired-less efforts, they got High School for Diplo Town in 1944. Poor people of Diplo Town and catchments rural areas could not afford to send their children to School. In order to provide equal chances of Education to the children of poor people, Late Saeen Haji Abutalib Memon and Late Haji Bhaledino Memon took pains to collect money from the public and created welfare Student Fund. The needy students irrespective of class and creed receive financial aid regularly this fund. In fact this fund helped this School a lot to flourish. Building The school from its babyhood was located in a private rented building up to 1961. The government building was completed in 1961 and after that the school is housed in that building. It consists of a grand building having a Drawing Hall, Laboratory Hall, Meeting Hall, Headmaster's Office, Office Room, Staff Room, Water Hut and 10 Class Rooms. This school has produced so may famous authors and novelists.

Aside from the fundamental interest in the coordination chemistry of simple molecules, studies in this field are motivated by the possibility that transition metals might catalyze useful transformations of CO2. This research is relevant both to organic synthesis and to the production of \\"solar fuels\\" that would avoid the use of petroleum-based fuels.\\"Carbon Dioxide as Chemical Feedstock\\" Edited by Michele Aresta. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2010. . Structural trends :Illustrative structures of transition metal carbon dioxide complexes, from the left: Ni(Œ∑2-CO2)(PCy3)2, Rh(Œ∑1-CO2)ClL4 (L4 = (diars)2), the metallacarboxylic ester CpFe(CO)2(Œ∑1:Œ∑1-CO2)Re(CO)5, and another dimetalla-ester. Carbon dioxide binds to metals in only a few ways. The bonding mode depends on the electrophilicity and basicity of the metal centre. Most common is the Œ∑2-CO2 coordination mode as illustrated by Aresta's complex, Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2, which was the first reported complex of CO2. This square-planar compound is a derivative of Ni(II) with a reduced CO2 ligand. In rare cases, CO2 binds to metals as a Lewis base through its oxygen centres, but such adducts are weak and mainly of theoretical interest. A variety of multinuclear complexes are also known often involving Lewis basic and Lewis acidic metals, e.g. metallacarboxylate salts (C5H2)Fe(CO)2CO2‚àíK+. In multinuclear cases (compounds containing more than one metal), more complicated and more varied coordination geometries are observed. One example is the unsymmetrical compound containing four rhenium centres, [(CO)5ReCO2Re(CO)4]2. Carbon dioxide can also bind to ligands on a metal complex (vs just the metal), e.g. by converting hydroxy ligands to carbonato ligands. Reactions Transition metal carbon dioxide complexes undergo a variety of reactions. Metallacarboxylic acids protonate at oxygen and eventually convert to metal carbonyl complexes: :[LnMCO2]‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ ‚Üí [LnMCO]+ \\\\+ H2O This reaction is relevant to the potential catalytic conversion of CO2 to fuels. Carbonation of metal-carbon bonds Insertion into Cu-C bonds N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported CuI complexes catalyze carboxylation of organoboronic esters. The catalyst forms in situ from CuCl, an NHC ligand, and KOtBu. Copper tert-butoxide can transmetallate with the organoboronic ester to generate the CuI-C bond, which intermediate can insert into CO2 smoothly to get the respective carboxylate. Salt metathesis with KOtBu releases product and regenerates catalyst (Scheme 2). Scheme 2 Copper catalyzed carboxylation of organoboronic ester Apart from transmetallation, there are other approaches forming Cu-C bond. C-H functionalization is a straightforward and atom economic method. Base can help deprotonate acidic C-H protons and form Cu-C bond. [(Phenanthroline)Cu(PR3)] catalyst effect C-H carboxylation on terminal alkynes together with Cs2CO3. NHC-Cu-H species to deprotonate acidic proton to effect carboxylation of terminal alkynes. Cu-H species were generated from Cu-F and organosilanes. The carboxylate product was trapped by silyl fluoride to get silyl ether. For non-acidic C-H bonds, directed metalation with iBu3Al(TMP)Li is adopted followed by transmetallation with copper to get Cu-C bond. Allylic C-H bonds and phenyl C-H bonds got carboxylated with this approach by Hou and co-workers: Scheme 3 Copper catalysed boracarboxylation of internal alkynes Carbometallation to alkynes and allenes using organozinc and organoaluminum reagents followed by transmetallation to copper is also a strategy to initiate carboxylation. Trimethylaluminium is able to insert into unbiased aliphatic internal alkynes with syn fashion directed by ether directing group. Vinyl copper complexes are formed by transmetallation and carboxylation is realized with a similar pathway giving tetrasubstituted aliphatic vinyl carboxylic acids. In this case, regioslectivity is controlled by the favor of six-membered aluminum ring formation. Furthermore, carboxylation can be achieved on ynamides and allenamides using less reactive dimethyl zinc via similar approach. Insertion in Pd-C bonds In the presence of palladium acetate under 1-30 bar of CO2, simple aromatic compounds convert to aromatic carboxylic acids. A PSiP-pincer ligand (5) promotes carboxylation of allene without using pre- functionalized substrates. Catalyst regeneration, Et3Al was added to do transmetallation with palladium. Catalyst is regenerated by the following Œ≤-H elimination. Apart from terminal allenes, some of internal allenes are also tolerated in this reaction, generating allyl carboxylic acid with the yield between 54% and 95%. This system was also applied to 1,3-diene, generating carboxylic acid in 1,2 addition fashion. In 2015, Iwasawa et al. reported the germanium analogue (6) and combined CO2 source together with hydride source to formate salts. Scheme 4 Pincer Pd complexes for catalytic carboxylation Palladium has shown huge power to catalyze C-H functionalization. If the Pd-C intermediate in carboxylation reaction comes from C-H activation, such methodology must promote metal catalyzed carboxylation to a much higher level in utility. Iwasawa and co-workers reported direct carboxylation by styrenyl C-H activation generating coumarin derivatives. Benzene rings with different electronic properties and some heteroaromatic rings are tolerated in this reaction with yield from 50% to 90%. C-H activation was demonstrated by crystallography study. Insertion by Rh-C bonds Similar to Cu(I) chemistry mentioned above, Rh(I) complexes can also transmetallate with arylboronic esters to get aryl rhodium intermediates, to which CO2 is inserted giving carboxylic acids. Later, Iwasawa et al. described C-H carboxylation strategy. Rh(I) undergoes oxidative addition to aryl C-H bond followed by transmetallation with alkyl aluminum species. Ar-Rh(I) regenerates by reductive elimination releasing methane. Ar-Rh(I) attacks CO2 then transmetallates with aryl boronic acid to release the boronic acid of product, giving final carboxylic acid by hydrolysis. Directed and non-directed versions are both achieved. Iwasawa and co-workers developed Rh(I) catalyzed carbonation reaction initiated by Rh-H insertion to vinylarenes. In order to regenerate reactive Rh-H after nucleophilic addition to CO2, photocatalytic proton-coupled electron transfer approach was adopted. In this system, excess amount of diethylpropylethylamine works as sacrificial electron donor (Scheme 5). Photocatalyzed carboxylation Insertion by Ni-C bond Carboxylation of benzyl halides has been reported. The reaction mechanism is proposed to involve oxidative addition of benzyl chloride to Ni(0). The Ni(II) benzyl complex is reduced to Ni(I), e.g., by zinc, which inserts CO2 delivering the nickel carboxylate. Reduction of the Ni(I) carboxylate to Ni(0) releases the zinc carboxylate (Scheme 6). Similarly, such carboxylation has been achieved on aryl and benzyl pivalate, alkyl halides, and allyl esters.

They were designed by the British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell and built in Saint Petersburg. Both ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet and had fairly uneventful careers mostly assigned to training units. struck a rock in 1869 and had to be run aground lest she sink. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 and Rusalka sank during a storm in the Gulf of Finland the next year with the loss of all hands. Her sister ship continued in service until 1907 and was eventually scrapped in 1911‚Äì12. Rusalkas wreck was discovered in 2003 by an expedition sponsored by the Estonian Maritime Museum. Design and description By late 1863, the Russian Admiralty Board had begun planning for the second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction and issued a requirement on 12 NovemberAll dates used in this article are New Style for a twin-screw low-freeboard ship that could sail throughout the Baltic Sea. It was to be armed with smoothbore Dahlgren guns and protected by up to of armor. Before even deciding which designs to accept, the Admiralty decided to order eight ships of various types in March 1864. Charles Mitchell was allocated only one of the eight ships before he submitted four different designs for the competition in May‚ÄìJune. Two ships of his simplest design were awarded to a new builder, S. G. Kudriavtsev, who was provided facilities at the state-owned Galernyi Island Shipyard. In addition the Admiralty committed itself to furnishing the armament, armor, engines and boilers as well as a variety of smaller components for the two ships.McLaughlin, p. 155 The Charodeika-class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessor, , and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ships were designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . They were fitted with a plough-shaped ram that projected forward of the bow. The Charodeikas were fitted with a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by watertight bulkheads into 25 compartments. Their crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877.McLaughlin, pp. 156‚Äì57 The ships had a freeboard of only and their decks were often awash in any sort of moderate sea. They rolled heavily and were very unmaneuverable, often not responding to the ship's wheel until 20 degrees of rudder was applied. The monitors were fitted with three iron pole masts, probably fore-and-aft rigged, and used to steady the ship rather than for propulsion.McLaughlin, pp. 154‚Äì57, 160 Propulsion The Charodeika class had two simple horizontal direct-acting steam engines, built by the Baird Works of Saint Petersburg.Russian Monitors and Coast Defense Ships, p. 306 The engines had a bore of and a stroke of and each drove a single four-bladed propeller. Steam was provided by two rectangular boilers at a pressure of . The engines were designed to produce a total of , but only produced which gave the ships speeds between when they ran their sea trials in 1869. The monitors also had a donkey boiler for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans and pumps. The Charodeika class carried a maximum of ; their range, however, is unknown.McLaughlin, pp. 156, 159‚Äì60 Armament The monitors were designed to be armed with four Obukhov rifled guns, a pair in each Coles-type turret. Various deckhouses and ventilation hatches prevented the turrets from firing directly forward or aft, so that each turret could bear approximately 150¬∞ to each side. Difficulties in manufacturing the guns and the delayed construction of the monitors themselves forced the Admiralty to change the armament to a pair of the 9-inch guns in the forward turret and a pair of smoothbore muzzle-loading Rodman guns in the aft turret. These guns were replaced by another pair of 9-inch rifled guns beginning in 1871. They were replaced in their turn in 1878‚Äì79 by two longer, more powerful 9-inch Obukhov guns. The ship carried 75 rounds for each gun.McLaughlin, pp. 156, 158 Light guns for use against torpedo boats are not known to have been fitted aboard the Charodeika-class ships before the 1870s when a variety of guns were added, although their numbers, calibers, and locations are only partially known. Charodeika received four 4-pounder guns, two mounted on the roofs of each gun turret while Rusalka had a total of three guns with only one gun on her aft turret. Other guns known have been fitted included Engstr√∂m quick-firing (QF) guns, QF Hotchkiss guns, QF Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon, and Nordenfelt guns.McLaughlin, p. 158 Armor The Charodeika-class monitors had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to aft and forward. It was high and completely covered the hull to below the waterline. The armor was backed by of teak. The turrets had of armor, also backed by teak, and the conning tower was 4.5 inches thick. Amidships, the deck was 1 inch thick, although it thinned to at the ends of the ship. Ships {|class=wikitable |- valign=top ! Name ! Namesake ! BuilderMcLaughlin, p. 152 ! Ordered ! Laid down !

The contract was transferred to Mitchell who completed them in 1869, two years after their scheduled delivery date for the cost of 762,000 roubles each. Both ships spent their entire careers with the Baltic Fleet. In June, Charodeika ripped a long hole in her hull when she struck an uncharted rock in the Gulf of Finland and had to be deliberately run aground to prevent her sinking. She was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment of the Baltic Fleet in March 1870 and Charodeika was later assigned to the Mine (Torpedo) Training Detachment.McLaughlin, pp. 160, 162‚Äì63 Both monitors were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 and Rusalka sank in a storm on 7 September 1893 during a voyage between Reval (Tallinn) and Helsingfors (Helsinki) with the loss of her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men. Despite an extensive search, the only traces of her found were one body and some debris that washed ashore. Charodeika remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911‚Äì12. Rusalkas wreck was discovered on 22 July 2003 in the Gulf of Finland, south of Helsinki, by a joint expedition of the Estonian Maritime Museum and the commercial diving company Tuukrit√∂√∂de O√ú. The wreck is generally intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out of the ship.

After leaving school he spent a year in 1959‚Äì60 working for Voluntary Service Overseas in British North Borneo before returning to London to study painting at the Royal College of Art, where he became strongly influenced by Op Art and in particular the work of Victor Vasarely. Bevan graduated from the RCA in 1964 and had his first exhibition of Op Art-inspired paintings the following year. Optical, geometric and kinetic art then served him well until the late 1970sJames Pardey, 'Oliver Bevan: In Search of Utopia'. RWA Magazine, Autumn 2012, pp.26‚Äì27. when he moved to the Canadian prairies for a two-year teaching post at the University of Saskatchewan. By the time he returned to London in 1979 he had abandoned abstract art in favour of figurative art and urban realism.  Optical, geometric and kinetic art  details). details). Bevan's first solo exhibition at the Grabowski Gallery, London, in 1965 featured eight Op Art paintings with hard edges and colour fields in black, white and shades of grey, plus red and blue in Both Ways 1 and 2. The paintings were based on isometric projections of a cube and played on the viewer's visual perception through tonal flicker, figure-ground reversals and other optical ambiguities which Bevan described as 'a conflict between the certainty of the geometry and the uncertainty of the perceptual mechanism in dealing with it', adding that the paintings are 'clues to what might be possible'.Stanislaw Frenkiel and Oliver Bevan. Grabowski Gallery, London, 1965. The exhibition attracted favourable reviews from critics such as John Dunbar, Norbert Lynton and Guy Brett,John Dunbar, 'Stimulus of Opposites'. The Scotsman, 7 August 1965.Norbert Lynton, 'Frenkiel and Bevan Exhibition'. The Guardian, 14 August 1965.Guy Brett, 'Expressionism and After'. The Times, 16 August 1965.Norbert Lynton, 'London Letter'. Art International, September 1965. with the latter concluding that it 'achieves its aim of intensifying our awareness of our perceptual processes, which implies our awareness of the visible world'. A second exhibition of ten new paintings at the Grabowski Gallery in 1967 introduced shaped canvases and a larger colour palette to further 'provoke the viewer into an active relationship with the work'.Double Take: Lois Matcham and Oliver Bevan. Grabowski Gallery, London, 1967. This concept of viewer participation ‚Äì whereby each person brings their own perceptual interpretation to the paintings and thus contributes to the creative process ‚Äì was made tangible in a third exhibition at the Grabowski Gallery in 1969.Oliver Bevan, Jules de Goede and Graham Gilchrist. Grabowski Gallery, London, 1969. This featured seventeen new works, including a tabletop piece consisting of sixteen square tiles which were each divided diagonally into two of four colours and could be rearranged by the viewer to create different combinations of figure and ground. Bevan then developed the idea further, using six magnetic tiles on a square steel sheet that was covered with black canvas and could be hung on the wall like a painting. This new work, Connections, was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1969‚Äì70 as part of Play Orbit, an exhibition of artworks that visitors could interact or 'play' with in the manner of toys and games.Jasia Reichardt (Ed), Play Orbit. London: Studio International, 1969.Connections, Institute of Contemporary Arts, 1969‚Äì70 Meanwhile, a chance visit to the Grabowski exhibition by John Constable, the Art Director at Fontana Books, led to a commission for Bevan to create the cover paintings for the first twenty titles in a series on vanguard thinkers and theorists called the Fontana Modern Masters. For this Bevan drew directly on his Connections piece, creating two sets of geometric cover designs that the reader could arrange as 'tiles' in a larger artwork.James Pardey, 'The Shape of the Century'. Eye Magazine, Winter 2009, pp.6‚Äì8. The books were published in 1970‚Äì73, by which time Bevan had also collaborated with the composers Brian Dennis and Grahame Dudley on a production at the Cockpit Theatre of Dennis's Z'Noc, a thirty-minute experimental piece in which the musicians take their cues from a constantly changing display of abstract colours, shapes and shadows that Bevan created by projecting light onto three mobiles.Brian Dennis, 'Experimental School Music'. The Musical Times, August 1972. This led Bevan to experiment with Polaroid as a medium for other types of kinetic art, and in 1973 he produced the first of his lightboxes using polarising filters and fluorescent tubes, with more complex versions employing electric motors and sets of slowly rotating discs. These lightboxes became the canvases for 'chromatropic paintings' which, as Bevan explained, enable 'colours to be selected in time as well as space',Oliver Bevan. The Electric Gallery, Toronto, 1978. resulting in a mesmerising display of changing colours and shifting shapes as forms dissolved and reappeared. Between 1974 and 1978 Bevan's chromatropic or 'time' paintings were exhibited in London, Zurich, Detroit and Toronto, with pieces such as Turning World, Crescendo, Sunspot and Co-Incidence (now in the Government Art CollectionCo-Incidence, Government Art Collection, 1978) winning plaudits from Ernst Gombrich and others.Oliver Bevan. J P Lehmans Graphics, London, 1974, with a commentary by Ernst Gombrich.Georgina Oliver, 'Oliver Bevan ‚Äì Light Boxes'. The Connoisseur, May 1974.Denis Bowen, 'Victor Vasarely and Oliver Bevan'. Arts Review, January 1975. Eight 'points' in the cycle of his Pyramid chromatrope were also used as Fontana Modern Masters covers, with the back of each book offering the following explanation: 'The painting is made of transparent materials which only assume colours when illuminated by polarised light. If the plane of polarisation is rotated slowly, which happens mechanically in a box designed to display the painting, the colours pass through a recurring cycle of change'.James Pardey, op. cit.  Figurative art and urban realism  details). details). details). details). On returning to London from Canada in 1979, Bevan rented a top-floor studio near Smithfield Market in Farringdon and became 'a painter of modern life', citing Manet, Degas and Sickert as influences along with the urban realism of New Objectivity ('Neue Sachlichkeit') in Germany and Edward Hopper and the Ashcan School in New York. Bevan's subject was the area around his studio and scenes from everyday life such as people in cars, on buses, crossing streets and, later, supermarket interiors. Solo exhibitions of his Farringdon paintings at two London galleries in 1981 and 1984 were followed by two at the Barbican Centre in 1986 and 1993. The latter presented Bevan's paintings of the Westway flyover, an elevated dual carriageway in west London that had captivated him when his car broke down and was towed to a garage in the sunless and somewhat alienating space between the road's concrete stanchions. According to the writer Will Self, Bevan 'was entranced by the shapes the flyover's decks described and embarked on a series of large-scale canvases that elegantly capture the strange dichotomies the road represents: its beauty and its terror, its light and its darkness'.Will Self, 'Do You Believe in the Westway?' London Evening Standard, May 1993. During this period, Bevan also organised, curated and participated in two group exhibitions of urban paintings (The Subjective City in 1989‚Äì90 and Witnesses & Dreamers in 1993‚Äì94) which toured to public art galleries around the UK. A solo exhibition, Urban Mirror, at the Royal National Theatre in 1997 continued his exploration of the painted city, with the writer Peter Ackroyd comparing Bevan's work to that of 'Auerbach and Kossoff, who have a genuine painterly reverence for the real features of the streets and the people. In that sense he can claim a spiritual affinity with the line of London painters which stretches back as far as William Hogarth'.Peter Ackroyd, Urban Mirror. Royal National Theatre, London, 1997. A second solo exhibition at the Royal National Theatre five years later presented a series of paintings that focused on a particular microcosm of urban life. The subject had presented itself in 1994, when Bevan moved to a new studio in disused classrooms at Wendell Park Primary School in west London. Walking to and from his studio each day, he became increasingly intrigued by the behaviour of the children in the playground, as he later explained: 'In zoological terms they are 'wild' for half an hour. This contrast between adult and child behaviour struck me more and more forcibly. While we, the adults, are fastidious about the space around our own bodies, only touching one another as a deliberate communication, the children are in continuous physical contact, holding hands, wrestling or skipping in pairs. The girls prefer more socialised games, forming groups to dance, skip or clap while the boys race, fight and kick footballs. My own childhood was unlike most of this, which is perhaps why I am so drawn to celebrate their physical energy, and cultural diversity ..... The children understood what I was doing and were excited to see themselves in the paintings'.Oliver Bevan, The Playground Series, 1999. A selection of Bevan's urban paintings in public and corporate collections are as follows: * Westway Triptych, 1987, now in the collection of the Museum of London. * Hanging On, 1989, now in the collection of Middlesbrough Art Gallery. * Apron, 1990, a series of four paintings commissioned by the British Airports Authority for Gatwick Airport. * A drink before the show, 1994, commissioned by Art on the Underground and now in the collection of the London Transport Museum.A drink before the show, London Transport Museum, 1994 * Walk, 1995, now in the collection of the Guildhall Art Gallery, London. * Balance, 1998, now in the collection of the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry. In 2001 Bevan relocated to Uz√®s, where the scope of his painting broadened again to include landscapes and, more recently, the effect of light on water.

Spanning a 400-mile area along U.S. Highway 89, Utah State Route 24 and Utah State Route 12 ‚Äì an All American Road ‚Äì the MPNHA encompasses five unique districts, each with its own distinct history and landmarks. According to its mission statement, the MPNHA \\"preserves, interprets, promotes, and enhances Utah's pioneer heritage‚Ä¶working to increase tourism, encourage economic development, revitalize communities, provide heritage educational opportunities, and improve the quality of life\\" within its districts. Furthermore, the area was formulated around three central themes: the interaction of people with the landscape, the interaction of people with each other and the interaction of people with the institutions they created. It is the only National Heritage Area designated and named for a specific people ‚Äì the Mormon Pioneers ‚Äì offering one of the best perspectives of the Mormon colonization experience in the United States. It has been identified by Congress as a factor in the settling and western expansion of the United States as well as becoming a major world power.  History  The MPNHA was established by legislation introduced by former Utah Senator Bob Bennett, which, as he said at the time, intended to preserve \\"the rich heritage and tremendous achievements of the Mormon Pioneers.\\" (Insert link) His bill was passed by Congress in July 2006 and signed into law by President George W. Bush in October of the same year. In 2010, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior approved a management plan that has funded restoration and revitalization projects heritage area.  Projects  The MPNHA works with the travel councils to realize its goal to preserve the history of both the early Mormon Pioneers as well as other groups who settled central and southern Utah, including the Native Americans, namely the Piute and Ute tribes, highlighting the diversity of the area. The area also produces the Discovery Road television program, which airs on a number of Utah television stations, including the Utah Educational Network. As of fall, 2019, the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area is expanding its interpretive mission by partnering with Story Road Utah, a mobile app which offers its users a personalized tour guide as they discover the hidden gems inside the MPNHA.  Districts  The five districts that make up the MPNHA include the scenic Boulder Loop, which contains Bryce Canyon National Park, The Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and Anasazi State Park. The Headwaters, encompassing Garfield, Piute and Wayne Counties provide ample opportunities for fishing and historical exploration, being the childhood home of famed outlaw Butch Cassidy. Little Denmark, In Sanpete County, explores the area's Scandinavian heritage. The district also contains the historic Manti Temple, where the annual Mormon Miracle Pageant was held annually until the summer of 2019. Sevier Valley hearkens back to the days of the old west, with families of ranchers and cowboys who have worked their families' land for generations. Finally, the Under the Rim district in Kane County is home to Zion National Park, which attracts 3.5 million visitors per-year.

Timbale pans can be large (such as that used to bake a panettone), or they can be small enough to conorise a single portion (like a tartlet pan). Timbales typically narrow toward the bottom. Bundt pans, angelfood cake pans, and springform pans can be substituted for purpose-made timbale bakeware. Timbales can also be steamed or baked in a water bath. As a dish, a timbale is a \\"deep dish\\" filling completely enclosed in a crust. The crust can be sheet pastry, slices of bread, rice, even slices of vegetable. Sartu di Riso is a rice crust timbale. Timballo di Melanzana uses overlapping strips of eggplant to enclose the filling, which can be a wide range of pre-cooked meats, sausages, cheeses, vegetables, and shaped pastas combined with herbs and spices and red or white \\"gravy\\", thickened with breadcrumbs if necessary. The assembled dish is then baked, to brown the crust and heat the filling to serving temperature.

The Glenn Springs area was a natural spring providing water for Apache and Kiowa routing the Grand Indian Crossing passage at Boquillas. The Comanche tribes beseech the fresh water crossing on the Comanche Trail during their equine incursions from and to the Mexican Plateau, Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt regions of Mexico. The rural settlement is located 11 miles (16 kilometers) south-southeast of the Panther Junction visitor center in what is now the Big Bend National Park, and is accessible only by high-clearance vehicle.National Park Service March 2000 The National Park Service maintains a back-country campground at Glenn Springs. Military occupation Glenn Springs was a military encampment, which was attacked by the troops of the Mexican General Pancho Villa on 5 May 1916, killing one civilian, three U.S. Army soldiers, and wounding several other troops. The Glenn Springs Raid came 57 days after the famous attack on Columbus, New Mexico. Wax Camp During the Spanish Texas era, candelilla was harvested in the Chisos Mountains of the Trans-Pecos. The wax plant provided a malleable solid for candles used by the Spanish missions in Texas during Franciscans Catholic orders. In 1914, W.K. Ellis and C.D. Wood established a wax factory on the embankment of Glenn Springs employing a population in the mountainous Chihuahuan Desert region. By 1916, the candelillero factory consisted of a boiler room with tall smoke stacks, six large extraction vats, and a water storage system for the production of candelilla wax.
