Chess career Georgiev first caught the eye of the chess world in 1983, when he became the World Junior Champion with an unusually strong score of 11¬Ω out of 13. This result automatically gave him the International Master title. Two years later, FIDE awarded him the Grandmaster title. In the process of becoming the Bulgarian Champion of 1984 (shared), 1986 and 1989, he rapidly became recognised as Bulgaria's number one player, taking over from Ivan Radulov and eventually giving way to Veselin Topalov. He has represented his country at the Chess Olympiad many times, playing on either board 1 or 2. Exceptionally, in 2002 he played for Macedonia, while he was temporarily resident there. At the 1988 World Blitz Championship in Saint John, Canada, Kiril Georgiev finished third after eliminating world champion Garry Kasparov (3 - 1) in the quarterfinal. In the semifinal he lost to Rafael Vaganian (3.5 - 4.5). The tournament was eventually won by Mikhail Tal. His record in international competition has been remarkable, considering that he has never quite reached supergrandmaster status (Elo 2700 or above). He was a winner at Sarajevo 1986 (and would meet board boy Ivan Sokolov there again, some 15 years later), San Bernardino 1988, Elenite (Burgas) 1992 (ahead of Sokolov, Topalov, Josif Dorfman, Yuri Razuvayev and Vassilios Kotronias) and the 1993 Budapest Zonal (ahead of Judit Polg√°r and ƒΩubom√≠r Ft√°ƒçnik). He repeated his Elenite success in 1995 (with Topalov, ahead of Nigel Short, Boris Gulko and Sergey Dolmatov) and won at Belgrade 2000 (ahead of Alexander Beliavsky and Ulf Andersson). Since 2000, his achievements have been no less impressive. First at Sarajevo 2001 (his first Category 16 tournament win - ahead of Topalov, Ilya Smirin, Alexei Dreev and Ivan Sokolov) and first at Bad W√∂rishofen 2002. At Gibraltar Chess Festival, he was joint winner (with Levon Aronian, Zahar Efimenko, Alexei Shirov and Emil Sutovsky) in 2005 and the outright winner in 2006 (ahead of Short, Sutovsky, Shirov, Vladimir Akopian and Viktor Bologan) with an 8¬Ω/10 score. This was also the year that he won a bronze medal at the European Individual Chess Championship (behind Zdenko Kozul and Vassily Ivanchuk). At the Aeroflot Open in Moscow, he finished only a half point off the lead. Accordingly, these results have caused his Elo rating to advance rapidly during 2005 and 2006, reaching 2680 in July 2006, and placing him at number 26 in the (FIDE) World's 100 top players. Georgiev has also participated in the World Chess Championship cycle. In 1990, he qualified for the Interzonal Tournament in Manila and placed a creditable 14th out of 64, surpassing expectation and losing only to Alexei Dreev. At Groningen in 1997, he lost in round 4 to Loek van Wely. In December 2009, he tied for 1st-4th with Georg Meier, Julio Granda and Viktor L√°zniƒçka in the 19th Magistral Pamplona Tournament. In 2010, he came third at the World Chess Open in Le√≥n. In 2011 he won the 29th Andorra Open. In 2009, he broke the world record for the most simultaneous chess games played: 360 games in just over 14 hours. He won 280, drew 74 and lost 6 for a total score of 88%. A score of at least 80% was required for the record to be accepted. He won the Bulgarian championship again for three consecutive years, in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

The parish includes the hamlets of Hornblotton and Lottisham. Hornblotton Green is a traditional English community with a small village hall. There are no shops in Hornblotton although there are 3 working farms, and a beautiful Victorian arts and crafts style church. The village is on the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath. Also a cycle route passes through. History Bradley comes from Old English and means the broad clearing or wood. The manor of Bradley was given to Glastonbury Abbey in 746 by Ethelbald, King of Mercia, and held it until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. The parish of West Bradley was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, while Hornblotton was part of the Whitstone Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks The Court Barn was built in the 15th century as a Tithe barn for Glastonbury Abbey, and was restored in the early 20th century. Lottisham Manor dates from the 15th century. Bradley House is slightly later having been built in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was completed in 1726 by Col William Piers and included ornamental canals in the grounds. Near the church in Hornblotton is Hornblotton House, a large country mansion with substantial outbuildings and a large pond. Religious sites The Church of England Parish Church of St Andrew, West Bradley dates predominantly from the 14th and 15th centuries, but underwent extensive restoration in the 19th century. The parish Church of St Mary in Lottisham was built in 1876 by Sir T. G. Jackson. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Church of St Peter in Hornblotton was built in 1872‚Äì74 by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, for the rector, Geoffrey Thring. It is a Grade I listed building, and features one of the first electric clocks produced.

It is found in the eastern United States and Canada, where it is most abundant in the South. It is sometimes confused with the related southwestern species figeater beetle Cotinis mutabilis, which is less destructive. The green June beetle is active during daylight hours. The adult is usually long with dull, metallic green wings; its sides are gold and the head, legs and underside are very bright shiny green. Their habitat extends from New Brunswick to Georgia, and as far west as California, with possible population crossover in Texas with their western cousin, the figeater beetle.  Life cycle  The complete life cycle for the green June beetle is one year.  Egg  Mating occurs in the early morning. The male is attracted by a strongly scented milky fluid secreted by the female. Mating lasts only a few minutes after which the female enters her burrow or crawls under matted grass. Once the mating process has taken place, the female will lay between 60 and 75 eggs underground during a two-week period. The eggs, when first laid, appear white and elliptical in shape, gradually becoming more spherical as the larvae develop. The eggs hatch in approximately 18 days into small, white grubs.  Larva  June bug larva stage The grubs will grow to about and are white with a brownish-black head and brown spiracles along the sides of the body. The larvae will molt twice before winter. The fully grown larva color is glassy yellowish white shading toward green or blue at the head and tail. The larva has stiff ambulatory bristles on its abdomen which assist movement. The larva normally travels on its back. The underground speed is considered more rapid than any other known genus of Scarabaeidae in the United States and is comparable to that of the hairy caterpillar. The larvae feed largely on humus and mold but can do considerable damage to plant root systems. Injury has been reported to vegetables and ornamental plants, particularly those which have been mulched. The larvae are considered pests when they cause damage to lawns or turf grasses. The insect is considered more injurious in its larval stages than as a beetle. Pupation occurs after the third larval stage, which lasts nearly nine months. The pupal stage occurs in an oval cocoon constructed of dirt particles fastened together by a viscid fluid excreted by the larva. The pupa is white when first formed but develops greenish tints just before emergence.  Adult  Fruit damage caused by June beetle (Cotinis nitida) The adults begin to appear in June after 18 days of the pupation period. The adult is from in length and in width. The color varies from dull brown with green stripes to a uniform metallic green. The margins of the elytra vary from light brown to orange yellow. The adult beetle will feed upon a variety of fruits including berries, grapes, peaches, nectarines, apples, pears and figs. Adults are particularly attracted to rotting fruit which often occurs after an initial damage to sound fruit.  Predation  The grubs of the beetle are largely held in control by natural enemies.  Insects  The larval stages of the friendly fly or large flesh fly (Sarcophaga aldrichi) have been observed attached near the base of the head and thorax of the adult beetle. The fly larvae have been observed inside the devoured thorax and abdomen of the beetle. The flesh fly (Sarcophaga helicobia) has been observed to prey on both the larva and adult stage of the June beetle. The digger wasp (Scolia dubia) attacks the larval stage of the beetle. The female will crawl into the larva burrow and lay her eggs on the grub.  Vertebrates  Below ground large number of larva are consumed by moles. During rainy periods, when the burrows of the larvae are flooded, the larvae will crawl to the surface. At these times the larvae are subject to predation by raccoons, gophers, skunks, opossums, and chipmunks. Birds will also attack the adult, notably the American crow, common grackle, northern mockingbird and blue jay.  Control  One of the most effective controls is used during the larva stage. Beetle larva can be controlled using milky spore disease (Bacillus popilliae), which occurs naturally in some larva. Milky spore treatment was first developed by the USDA in the 1930s to combat the Japanese beetle but milky spore controls the June bug and Oriental beetle as well. Milky spore treatment was the first microbial product ever registered in the US. Milky spore begins working after treatment wherever larva are feeding. In warm climates milky spore disease can achieve control in 2‚Äì3 years. Colder climates may require longer. The soil is inoculated annually for 3 to 5 years and once the treatment is established, it is effective for 10 years or more dependent upon climate conditions.

In response to theories developed by scientists, some religious individuals and organizations questioned the legitimacy of scientific ideas that contradicted the literal interpretation of the creation account in Genesis. Interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible had long been the prerogative of an orthodox priesthood able to understand Latin who traditionally held that Genesis was not meant to be read literally and taught it as an allegory. With the advent of the printing press, the translation of the Bible into other languages, and wider literacy, sundry and more literal understandings of scripture flourished. This allowed some religious persons and groups to challenge scientists who supported evolution, such as biologists Thomas Henry Huxley and Ernst Haeckel. Creation‚Äìevolution controversy in the age of Darwin Although the history of evolutionary thought dates back to Empedocles and other Greek philosophers in Europe (5th century BCE), and Taoism in Asia, and the history of evolutionary thought in Christian theology dates back to Augustine of Hippo (4th century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th century), the current creation‚Äìevolution controversy originated in Europe and North America in the late 18th century. Discoveries in geology led to various theories of an ancient earth, and fossils showing past extinctions prompted early ideas of evolution, which were particularly controversial in England, where both the natural world and the hierarchical social order were thought to be fixed by God's will. As the terrors of the French Revolution developed into the Napoleonic Wars, followed by economic depression threatening revolution in Great Britain itself, such subversive ideas were rejected, associated only with radical agitators. Theologian Charles Hodge, a critic of Charles Darwin's theories, also praised Darwin for his intellectual honesty Conditions eased with economic recovery, and when Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was anonymously published in 1844 its ideas of transmutation of species attracted wide public interest despite being attacked by the scientific establishment and many theologians who believed it to be in conflict with their interpretations of the biblical account of life's, especially humanity's, origin and development. However, radical Quakers, Unitarians and Baptists welcomed the book's ideas of \\"natural law\\" as supporting their struggle to overthrow the privileges of the Church of England. Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation remained a best-seller, and paved the way for widespread interest in the theory of natural selection as introduced and published by English naturalist Charles Darwin in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Darwin's book was praised by Unitarians as well as by liberal Anglican theologians whose Essays and Reviews (1860) sparked considerably more religious controversy in Britain than Darwin's publication, as its support of higher criticism questioned the historical accuracy of literal interpretations of the Bible and added declarations that miracles were irrational. Darwin's book revolutionized the way naturalists viewed the world. The book and its promotion attracted attention and controversy, and many theologians reacted to Darwin's theories. For example, in his 1874 work What is Darwinism? the theologian Charles Hodge argued that Darwin's theories were tantamount to atheism.; The controversy was fueled in part by one of Darwin's most vigorous promoters, Thomas Henry Huxley, who opined that Christianity is a \\"...compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of Paganism and Judaism, moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the Western world...\\"; Perhaps the most uncompromising of the evolutionary philosophers was Ernst Haeckel, who dogmatically affirmed that nothing spiritual exists. A watershed in the Protestant objections to evolution occurred after about 1875. Previously, citing Louis Agassiz and other scientific luminaries, Protestant contributors to religious quarterlies dismissed Darwin's theories as unscientific. After 1875, it became clear that the majority of naturalists embraced evolution, and a sizable minority of these Protestant contributors rejected Darwin's theory because it called into question the veracity of Scriptures. Even so, virtually none of these dissenters insisted on a young Earth. The greatest concern for creationists in the late 19th century was the issue of human ancestry. In the words of an 1896 religious tract: A satirical image of Darwin as an ape from 1871 reflects part of the social controversy over whether humans and apes share a common lineage Creationists during this period were largely premillennialists, whose belief in Christ's return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible. However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth, the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days., Noting that this applies to published or public skeptics. Many or most Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation, but these views were rarely expressed in books and journals. Exceptions are also noted, such as literal interpretations published by Eleazar Lord (1788-1871) and David Nevins Lord (1792-1880). However, the observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: Louis Agassiz (1807-1873); Arnold Henry Guyot (1807-1884); John William Dawson (1820-1899); Enoch Fitch Burr (1818-1907); George D. Armstrong (1813-1899); Charles Hodge, theologian (1797-1878); James Dwight Dana (1813-1895); Edward Hitchcock, clergyman and respected Amherst College geologist, (1793-1864); Reverend Herbert W. Morris (1818-1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?-1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838-1922); Alexander Patterson, Presbyterian evangelist who published The Other Side of Evolution Its Effects and Fallacy. Scopes Trial Initial reactions in the United States matched the developments in Britain, and when Alfred Russel Wallace went there for a lecture tour in 1886‚Äì1887 his explanations of \\"Darwinism\\" were welcomed without any problems, but attitudes changed after the First World War. The controversy became political when public schools began teaching that man evolved from earlier forms of life per Darwin's theory of natural selection. In response, the U.S. state of Tennessee passed the Butler Act of 1925 prohibiting the teaching of any theory of the origins of humans that contradicted the teachings of the Bible. This law was tested in the highly publicized Scopes Trial of 1925. The law was upheld by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and remained on the books until 1967 when it was repealed. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas that banning the teaching of specific theories contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because their primary purpose was religious. Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) textbooks Work in genetics culminating in the 1937 publication of Genetics and the Origin of Species by Theodosius Dobzhansky, combining Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian natural selection, and explaining, through neutral mutations, the source of the variation upon which evolution acted, led to a synthesis that brought together disparate fields of biology and other sciences into a strong, coherent explanation of evolution. A campaign ensued, urging schools to teach the \\"fact\\" of evolution, and in the 1960s, the federally supported Biological Sciences Curriculum Study biology text books were introduced, promoting evolution as the organizing principle of biology. The belief in the power of science amongst biologists was running especially high: One of the prominent creators of the modern evolutionary synthesis, Julian Huxley, made a religion of humanism, saying that a \\"drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centered pattern,\\" and advocating the use of science to further expand human capacities. Meanwhile, public opinion polls suggested that most Americans either believed that God specially created human beings or guided evolution. Membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of Scripture continued to rise, with the Southern Baptist Convention and Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod outpacing all other denominations. With growth, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media. With decreasing church membership among evolutionary scientists, the role of opposing the anti-BSCS textbook movement passed from prominent scientists in liberal churches to secular scientists less equipped to reach Christian audiences. Anti-evolutionary forces were able to reduce the number of school districts utilizing BSCS biology text books, but courts continued to prevent religious instruction in public schools. ICR and the co-opting of the creationist label John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris' influential The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications was published in 1961.; The authors argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs, and that God created each kind of life. With publication, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences. Morris set up the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC), an organization dominated by Baptists, as an adjunct to the Christian Heritage College. The CSRC rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism. These efforts were against the recommendations of Morris, who urged a more cautious and scientific approach. Ultimately, the CSRC broke up, and Morris founded the Institute for Creation Research in 1970. Morris promised that the ICR, unlike the CSRC, would be controlled and operated by scientists. During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology, adopted the scientific sounding terms scientific creationism and creation science., \\"Fundamentalists no longer merely denounced Darwinism as false; they offered a scientific-sounding alternative of their own, which they called either 'scientific creationism (as distinct from religious creationism) or 'creation science' (as opposed to evolution science.)\\" The flood geologists effectively co-opted \\"the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views.\\"; Previously, creationism was a generic term describing a philosophical perspective that presupposes the existence of a supernatural creator. The Catholic Church and evolution Among the first recorded responses of a prominent Roman Catholic clergyman to Darwin's theory was that of the Blessed John Henry Newman, who in 1868, in a letter to a fellow priest, made the following comments: Some point to the fact that before ordination all Catholic priests have to study the teachings of Thomas Aquinas, who subscribed to an Aristotelian view of evolution, in which he posits that animal species evolve by means of mutations and natural law. More recent statements have been made by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI Text developed during plenary sessions of the International Theological Commission held in Rome from 2000‚Äì2002, and published by the Commission with permission from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. that also support a theistic understanding of evolution. The current controversy The controversy continues to this day, with the scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life actively attacked by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold other forms of creationism (usually young Earth creationism (YEC), creation science, old Earth creationism or intelligent design (ID)) as an alternative. Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize. * Some see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views which cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by mainstream churches and some scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it., and , summarizing Gould. * More recently, the intelligent design movement has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. However, Leonard Krishtalka, a paleontologist and an opponent of the movement, has called intelligent design \\"nothing more than creationism in a cheap tuxedo,\\" and, in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005) United States District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that \\"intelligent design is not science,\\" but is \\"grounded in theology\\" and \\"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.\\" Whether ID Is Science, p. 89, and Conclusion. Before the trial began, U.S. President George W. Bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution \\"I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.\\" * Scientists argue that intelligent design does not represent any research program within the scientific community, and is opposed by most of the same groups who oppose creationism., \\"Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of creation science; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.\\" * Timeline of the controversy * 1650 - Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh James Ussher states that the universe was created in 4004 BC, in direct conflict with the former prevailing Aristotelian view of a cyclical and eternal earth. * 1785 - James Hutton presented his theory of uniformitarianism, explaining that the Earth must be much older than previously supposed to allow time for mountains to be eroded and for sediment to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. * 1794 to 1796 - Erasmus Darwin published Zoonomia with ideas on evolution and all warm-blooded animals arising from one living filament. * 1802 - William Paley publishes Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity which uses the watchmaker analogy to argue for the existence of God from signs of intelligent design in the living world. * 1809 - Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a theory of evolution by acquired characteristics, later known as Lamarckism. * 1830 to 1833 - Charles Lyell published Principles of Geology denigrating catastrophism. * 1836 - William Buckland, theologian and geologist, publishes Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology which was sixth in the Bridgewater Treatises series and rejected a global flood. * 1844 - Robert Chambers anonymously published the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. * 1857 - Philip Henry Gosse published Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot. * 1859 - Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species regarding the theory of evolution, after over 20 years of research and discovery. Darwin was prompted to publish by the publication of an essay by Alfred Russel Wallace, which independently summarized the theory. The theory's most profound element, \\"natural selection,\\" challenged the generally accepted idea of divine intervention in species formation, leading to strong reactions to Darwin's theory. * 1860 - Liberal theologians published Essays and Reviews supporting Darwin. A debate of Darwin's theory was arranged at the Oxford University Museum, with Thomas Henry Huxley among its defenders and Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, leading its critics. Later accounts indicate Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker was most vocal in defending Darwinism. * 1923 - The New Geology by Seventh-day Adventist George McCready Price was inspiration and basis for Whitcomb and Morris' The Genesis Flood (see 1961 below). * 1925 - The Scopes Trial tested the new Butler Act, which made it illegal to teach that man descended from animals in public schools. Scopes was found guilty and fined $100; prosecution lawyer William Jennings Bryan offered to pay it, but it was later set aside on a technicality after appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court. * 1950 - Pope Pius XII issued the papal encyclical Humani Generis, which states that evolution is compatible with Christianity insofar as to discover \\"the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter,\\" but that to apply evolution to matters of spirituality is inappropriate. The Roman Catholic Church has since refined its interpretations of Genesis as symbolic of spirituality. * 1958 - The National Science Foundation started the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, which emphasizes evolution in high school biology textbooks. This was part of a broad-based improvement of education in the United States in response to the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 satellite. (See Sputnik crisis; New Math) * 1961 - The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications by John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris reinvigorated the creationist movement. * 1968 - A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Epperson v. Arkansas case repealed all remaining creationist laws. The Court supported a District Court ruling that a 1928 Arkansas law violated the Establishment Clause because it prohibited the teaching of evolution. * 1973 - Tennessee passed a law requiring textbooks with a theory of origin to give equal emphasis to the Genesis account of creation. In 1975, the law was ruled unconstitutional in Daniel v. Waters as a violation of the Establishment Clause. * 1981 - The state of Arkansas adopts a law known as the \\"Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution- Science Act\\" (Act 590). A ruling from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas in McLean v. Arkansas (1982) found the law to be a violation of the Establishment Clause. * 1987 - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Edwards v. Aguillard that a Louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools, along with evolution, was unconstitutional because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. * 1991 - Darwin on Trial by Phillip E. Johnson initiated the intelligent design movement. * 1996 - Michael J. Behe wrote Darwin's Black Box, which proposed that some biological systems are irreducibly complex. * 1996 - On October 22, Pope John Paul II sent the message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, stating that \\"new knowledge\\" requires one to realize that evolution is \\"more than a hypothesis.\\" * 1999 - On August 11, the Kansas State Board of Education deleted discussion of evolution and the Big Bang from standards relating to state assessments. * 2001 - The Kansas State Board of Education reinstated the discussion of evolution and the Big Bang after the removal of three board members. * 2002 - After much debate, the Ohio State Board of Education partially adopted the new \\"Teach the Controversy\\" initiative of intelligent design activists. In 2004, the board created a \\"Critical Analysis of Evolution\\" lesson plan for teachers. * 2004 - On January 30, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter released a statement condemning the suggestion that the word \\"evolution\\" be banned from textbooks used in schools in the state of Georgia. * 2004 - On February 19, Italian Education Minister Letizia Moratti issued a legislative decree that Italian children will learn about creationism. On April 23, top Italian scientists responded with an open letter and a petition, signed by more than 50,000 citizens, claiming that her proposal would sacrifice the \\"scientific curiosity of youth.\\" Moratti clarified that her proposal did not ban the teaching of evolution, but rescinded the decree nonetheless and even acted to bolster the presence of evolution in Italian academic curricula. * 2004 - On July 23, the International Theological Commission issued a document, Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God. * 2005 - The Kansas State Board of Education \\"scheduled six days of courtroom-style hearings\\" concerning the teaching of evolution. * 2005 - In September, parents in the Dover Area School District legally challenged intelligent design after a statement read to students claimed that there are \\"gaps\\" in evolution and that intelligent design is an alternative about which they can learn from the textbook Of Pandas and People. In December, the federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, issued a sweeping decision asserting that intelligent design is just another name for creationism, that it is not science, and that it cannot be taught as science in public schools. * 2005 - In November, eight of the nine-member Dover, Pennsylvania, school board were voted out and replaced with a coalition of Democratic and Republican candidates who oppose the previous board's decision to introduce intelligent design and lay doubts on evolution. The coalition ran on the Democratic ticket. The newly elected board members agreed to not appeal the court decision in Kitzmiller and have removed the intelligent design requirements from the school district's curriculum. (See Teaching Intelligent Design: Incumbent Dover PA school board fails reelection.) *2005 - On December 20, the court in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District issued its ruling that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution as an \\"explanation of the origin of life\\" thus violated the Establishment Clause. In his ruling, the judge wrote that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature. Conclusion. *2007 - Creation and Evolution: A Conference with Pope Benedict XVI in Castel Gandolfo is first published in German. While concluding a holiday in northern Italy, Pope Benedict XVI commented, \\"This clash [between evolution and creationism] is an absurdity because on one hand there is much scientific proof in favor of evolution, which appears as a reality that we must see and which enriches our understanding of life and being as such.\\" * See also * Creation‚Äìevolution controversy * History of creationism * History of evolutionary thought References Citations        \\"Papers from a conference held at Castel Gandolfo, Italy, Sept. 2006.\\" Category:Creationism Category:Evolution and religion Category:Intelligent design controversies ","title":"History of the creation‚Äìevolution controversy"},{"id":"8127494","text":"Location of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county in Hungary Tivadar is a village in Szabolcs-Szatm√°r-Bereg county, in the Northern Great Plain region of eastern Hungary.

It was invented in 1968 by Bernard J. Eastlund and William C. Gough while they were program managers of the controlled thermonuclear research program of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The basic concept was to impinge the plasma leaking from fusion reactors onto solids or liquids, vaporizing, dissociating and ionizing the materials, then separating the resulting elements into separate bins for collection. Other applications of fusion plasmas such as generation of UV and optical light, and generation of hydrogen fuel, were also described in their associated 1969 paper. How it works The process began with a tokamak, a doughnut-shaped magnetic ‚Äúbottle‚Äù, containing plasma and unwanted material. This combination would result in a pool of electrons and nuclei which in turn would cause the tokamak to overflow and transfer the plasma into an outlet. This plasma then passes through a series of metal plates, differing in particular temperatures, all arranged in descending order. The atoms of elements pass over the plates with boiling points above their own. Eventually, the atoms encounter plates where the temperature is lower than their boiling point. This makes them stick onto the plate. The plates then work as a distillation system which sorts the plasma into its constituent elements. These pure elements can then be reused. 1969 paper In the paper The Fusion Torch ‚Äì Closing the Cycle from Use to Reuse, Bernard J. Eastlund and William C. Gough defined Population (food), Entropy (resources, energy, pollution), and War (human needs and behavior) as three traps that could hamper the advancement of mankind. In terms of energy needs they estimated that by the year 2000 they would need 140,000 megawatts of electrical capacity.Energy Resources, Report to the Committee on Natural Resources, publication 1000-D, (Washington: National Academy of Sciences- National Research Council, 1962). They also speculated that the fusion torch concept would be useful for the separation of uranium from reactor fuel element material. Effects on the environment Although the fusion torch will help in disposal of pollution and waste and make it available for reuse, there is also a problem that arises. The process of separating elements uses a lot of energy, and therefore creates a lot of heat. With the rise of the standards of living, all this heat that is created from using the fusion torch will be released into the atmosphere. Such a large amount of heat could cause the surface temperature of the earth to rise. This could eventually lead to severe climate modifications and put a limit on world population and standards of living. However, the heat generated from the fusion torch and fusion can be \\"contained\\" if the system is brought to a break-even temperature, therefore, becoming self-sustaining.

Situated on Romney Marsh, St Mary's Bay has a long sandy beach which stretches north to Dymchurch and south to Littlestone-on-Sea. It has a station on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. History During the 1950s and 1960s, St Mary's Bay was a popular destination for vacationers. 'The Bay' had a number of holiday camps, among them Maddieson's Golden Sands at Dunstall Lane, the School Journey Centre at Jefferstone Lane, and the Rugby Club camp on the opposite (sea) side of the A259 main road between Jefferstone Lane and Taylor's Lane. The School Journey Center closed at the end of the 1970s, and the site is now occupied by a housing estate. Also at St Mary's Bay was the Sands Holiday Motel and accompanying Bahia Bar, sited on the seafront roughly opposite the turning to Jefferstone Lane on the A259. The hotel and bar were demolished after being badly damaged in the Great Storm of 1987. St Mary's Bay was the site of a home for mentally handicapped children. Known as Pirates Spring and located on Coast Drive close to the beach, the home was run by the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children (now Mencap) and had the actor Brian Rix among its patrons. After the facility closed in the 1980s the building housed a hotel and country club in the 1990s. The Springs Community now provides sheltered housing accommodation for people with the special needs associated with autism spectrum disorders. Entertainment The beach looking towards Dymchurch 'The Bay' had a number of pubs and clubs, including the Bailiffs Sargeant; The Levin Club; The Nightrider and Pirate Spring's Country Club. Of these, only The Bailiffs Sergeant and The Levin Club remain open to the public today. Many were closed as a result of the diminishing tourist traffic to the area. The Nightrider Club, formerly next to the Jenner's coal yard, was demolished in the 1990s and the site, along with the coal yard itself, is now occupied by houses. Currently the only takeaway food shop is Yongs Chinese Takeaway, positioned almost next to The Bailiffs Sergeant pub.  Retailers  At one time 'The Bay' was home to a number of shops, but these are now reduced in number. The Post Office is located in Teelin Close down Jefferstone Lane, having previously been sited in a building that was part of the School Journey Centre at the top of Jefferstone Lane at the junction with the A259. There were two Newsagents, one at the top of Taylors Lane alongside the former St Mary's Bay Garage, and the other, St Mary's Bay Superstore, down Jefferstone Lane. The former has now closed and become a private house. St Mary's Bay Superstore has now become the Beachside Stores, which is a general newsagents and the biggest shop in the area, after Sainsbury's (New Romney). Also down Jefferstone Lane is Foords electrical retailers. During the 1970s St Mary's Bay had a small supermarket situated at the top of Jefferstone Lane opposite the previous Post Office site. Known as the 'Mini-Market', it closed at the end of the 1970s. The building remained empty until the 1990s, when it was pulled down and a new housing development, Jesson Close, built on the site. 'The Bay' was host to both a butcher's and a baker's, but both are gone now; the site down Jefferstone Lane had houses built on it in the late 1980s in a development named Old Bakery Close. In between what was once 'Harry's Newsagents' and the post office was a restaurant called Betty's Restaurant. This closed and was reopened as a pharmacy which closed soon afterwards. In Teelin Close is a hairdressers called Joannes - this building was established approx 50 years ago - originally known as Mollys Education 'The Bay' has a small nursery school in Jefferstone Lane next door to the church. Children older than nursery school age go to schools outside St Mary's Bay, generally Dymchurch Junior School. Some later attend the Marsh Academy in New Romney, and some travel to schools further afield. Religion St Mary's Bay has a small modern Anglican church of All Saints, located on Jefferstone Lane. It is part of the parish of St Mary in the Marsh, where there is a much older church. Other facilities 'The Bay' is the home to an Army Cadet Force Detachment, located down Jefferstone Lane just over the RH & DR railway crossing adjacent to a caravan park. St Mary's Bay has a modern village hall located opposite the site of The Bailiffs Sergeant pub on land that was originally part of the School Journey Centre holiday camp. Previously the town hall was located in one of the holiday camp's old buildings; the building remained in use for some years after the rest of the holiday camp had been demolished. Although no longer offering fuel, the St Mary's Bay Garage site maintains a facility for light automotive repair, in the shape of Colin Wood Engineering, who occupy the service area of the garage, which is located on the left (New Romney) side of the old St Mary's Bay Garage building. At the end of Jefferstone Lane is a large well-kept recreation ground with a pavilion for sporting events. Famous residents St Mary's Bay was the home of actor Larry Martyn, who lived down Jefferstone Lane in Old Bakery Close until he died in 1994. The children's author E. Nesbit, author of The Railway Children, lived with her second husband, Captain Tucker, in St Mary's Bay between the two World Wars and is buried in the churchyard at nearby St Mary in the Marsh.

The parish includes the hamlets of Coxbridge and Woodlands. History The village takes its name from the Old Welsh pen ard meaning high hill. The manor was granted to Glastonbury Abbey by the king of the Mercians in 681, and was held by the Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. It was then granted to Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset in 1547 until his execution when it reverted to the Crown and leased to successive members of the Rogers family until 1628 when it was sold to Thomas Howard, Earl of Berkshire. West Pennard features a number of historical settlements. Old Farmhouse, East Street dates from the mid 14th century and features crucks. Other sites such as Higher Southtown Farm, Pennard Farm (~1640), and Manor Farmhouse, Coxbridge were significantly altered in the latter part of the 16th century. At least four houses dating from the 17th century exist. These include Sticklinch Manor, the Apple Tree inn, and a timber framed dwelling known as 'The Cottage' in Higher Southtown. West Pennard Court Barn, dating from the 15th-century was built as a Tithe Barn for Glastonbury Abbey, and is now owned by the National Trust. A field referred to as Millfurlong on Pennard Hill in 1515 indicates the presence of a windmill. Owing to decay the windmill had been rebuilt by 1606 and stood at Westerdown, remaining in operation until at least 1713. The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides.  Culture & Social  In 1861 a fair was run on the first Monday in August, and had transitioned to a cattle fair held on the last Monday in July by 1872. The fair ran until approximately 1902. In 1837 a group of farmers presented Queen Victoria with a cheese created with the milk of 700 cows for the anniversary of her coronation. An octagonal mould made of Spanish mahogany was created (a replica of which is in the village hall) featuring laurels and oak leaves. On 28 June seven of the largest cheese tubs in West Pennard were borrowed, and the cheese was made to canon fire and the ringing of church bells at the farm of George Naish. The initial pressing stuck to the mould and was reset in the mould after partial treatment. Delivering the 1/2 ton cheese measuring over 37 inches across and 22 inches high to Buckingham Palace Queen Victoria reportedly declared that she preferred her cheese \\"mature, and not new\\", sending them away whilst it matured. During this period the cheese was displayed at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly. After being ejected from the Egyptian Hall the cheese ended up at a farm in Sticklinch, before ending up at the Old Down Inn. The cheese was not said to be good, and fed to pigs. The Red Lion pub featured in a 2015 television advert promoting the Rugby World Cup. West Pennard village hall was gifted by Lady Mostyn of West Pennard House in memory of her husband and opened in 1937. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls in 'The Pennards and Ditcheat' electoral ward. From West Pennard the ward stretches through East Pennard to Ditcheat. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census is 2,180. The village is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Transport West Pennard railway station was a station on the Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, and briefly featured in \\"Branch Line Railway\\", a BBC documentary on the Joint Railway presented by John Betjeman. It opened in 1862 and closed in 1962. The A361 passes through West Pennard running east‚Äìwest, first being described as the 'great road going to Pilton' in 1235. Maintenance was once the responsibility of a pontarius whose other duties included caring for a Saxon bridge at Steanbow, later replaced. By 1780 the road was the responsibility of the Shepton trust. Connectivity reduced somewhat during the 18th century with the closure of a road running past West Pennard church, along the lower slopes of Pennard Hill, East Street and ultimately through Norwood Park, linking Bruton to Glastonbury. A road taking a similar route from West Bradley to Wells also closed during this period. Religious sites The Church of St Nicholas dates from the 15th century and is a Grade I listed building. The churchyard cross, which was built between 1493 and 1524 by Abbot Richard Beere of Glastonbury, is also Grade I listed. The Piltown Wesleyan Methodist chapel built in 1847 closed in 1964 and is now a private residence. The adjourning day school was opened in 1878, but had closed by 1931 owing to falling attendance.

He was also Minister of Finance from 1970 until 1972. Career Jalloud was a classmate of Gaddafi.https://archive.org/details/qaddafilibyanre00blun/page/40/mode/2upMajor Abdessalam Jalloud entered the military academy of Benghazi where they formed the hard core of the \\"free officers\\" who staged a military coup in September 1969 launching the Libyan revolution. Jalloud became Gaddafi‚Äôs adviser and deputy chairman of the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). He was entrusted with the supervision of the oil sector, which represented 96% of the country's income. In September 1970 Jalloud succeeded in imposing a rise in oil prices to all companies operating in Libya, opening the way for the other oil producers and for the subsequent rises of the 1970s. The same year, Jalloud also succeeded in negotiating for the evacuation of American and British military bases from Libya. During the negotiations for the evacuation of the American Air Force base at Wheelus, on the outskirts of Tripoli, the then 25-year-old Jalloud, dressed in military regalia, was advised by the American diplomatic envoy leading the U.S. delegation that he could not negotiate, \\"under the gun,\\" nor, in the clamorous atmosphere of the hundreds of Libyan protesters who had been gathered outside the venue, loudly refusing to depart the scene prior to an evacuation date being set. Jalloud exited the room and removed his pistol, returning to state, \\"As for the demonstrators, you take your orders from the U.S. Government while I take mine from those voices outside.\\" American troops were subsequently evacuated and Wheelus was handed over to the Libyans, on 11 June 1970. In March 1970, six months after the Libyan revolution, Jalloud went to Beijing to build bilateral ties and evaluate areas of potential scientific cooperation between Libya and the People‚Äôs Republic of China. As part of the Libyan state's efforts to evaluate solutions to what was then a foreseeable water crisis in the North African country, Jalloud solicited Chinese assistance for a peaceful nuclear energy program, aimed mainly at expanding Libya's desalination industry. Jalloud (from the Magarha tribe) was the second most powerful person in the Libyan government for over two decades. After several disagreements with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi (from the Qadhadhfa tribe), Jalloud resigned, departing the Libyan political scene, and was replaced by Captain Mohammad Emsied al- Majdoub al-Gaddafi as the general coordinator of the Revolutionary Committees.Gaddafi‚Äôs Intelligence and security Agencies in the Nineties, in Libyans4Justice The London-based newspaper Al Hayat reported in April 1995 that the authorities had confiscated Jalloud's passport and kept him under surveillance because of growing disagreement between him and Gaddafi. This disagreement was shown in public after the visit of a delegation of 192 Libyan pilgrims to Israel in May 1993. Libyan Civil War On 19 August 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, it was reported that Jalloud had defected to the rebel forces opposing Gaddafi and was on his way from Zintan to Europe.

At the time, the southern half of Sakhalin Island, then known as Karafuto Prefecture, was under the control of the Empire of Japan; the Japanese government both recruited and forced Korean labourers into service and shipped them to Karafuto to fill labour shortages resulting from World War II. The Red Army invaded Karafuto days before Japan's surrender; while all but a few Japanese there repatriated successfully, almost one-third of the Koreans could not secure permission to depart either to Japan or their home towns in South Korea. For the next forty years, they lived in exile. In 1985, the Japanese government offered transit rights and funding for the repatriation of the original group of Sakhalin Koreans; however, only 1,500 of them returned to South Korea in the next two decades. The vast majority of Koreans of all generations chose instead to stay on Sakhalin. Due to differing language and immigration history, Sakhalin Koreans may or may not identify themselves as Koryo-saram. The term \\"Koryo- saram\\" may be used to encompass to all Koreans in the former USSR, but typically refers to ethnic Koreans from Hamgy≈èng province whose ancestors emigrated to the Russian Far East in the 19th century, and then were later deported to Central Asia. The issue of self-identification is complicated by the fact that many Sakhalin Koreans feel that Koreans from Central Asia look down on them. History  Under Japanese colonialism   Origins  Approximate locations of the massacres 1: Shikuka, near Kamishisuka (‰∏äÊï∑È¶ô) 2: Maoka, near Mizuho Village (ÁëûÁ©ÇÊùë) Korean immigration to Sakhalin began as early as the 1910s, when the Mitsui Group began recruiting labourers from the peninsula for their mining operations. In 1920, ten years after the annexation of Korea by Japan, there were fewer than one thousand Koreans in the whole of Karafuto Prefecture, overwhelmingly male. Aside from an influx of refugees from the Maritimes, who escaped to Karafuto during the Russian Revolution of 1917, the number of Koreans in the province did not rise very rapidly; as late as the mid-1930s, there were fewer than 6,000 Koreans in Karafuto. However, as Japan's war effort picked up, the Japanese government sought to put more people on the ground in the sparsely-populated prefecture in order to ensure their control of the territory and fill the increasing demands of the coal mines and lumber yards. Recruiters turned to sourcing workers from the Korean peninsula; at one point, over 150,000 Koreans were relocated to work on the island. Of those, around 10,000 mine workers were relocated to Japan prior to the war's end; present-day Sakhalin Koreans' efforts to locate them proved futile. The Imperial Japanese Army in Karafuto frequently used local ethnic minorities (Oroks, Nivkhs, and Ainu) to conduct intelligence-gathering activities, because, as indigenous inhabitants, their presence would not arouse suspicion on the Soviet half of the island. Ethnic Koreans could also be found on both sides of the border, but the use of Koreans as spies was not common, as the Karafuto police were wary of the support for the independence movement among Koreans. Soviet suspicion towards Korean nationalism, along with fears that the Korean community might harbour Japanese spies, led to the 1937 deportation of Koreans from Soviet-controlled northern Sakhalin and the Russian Far East. Soviet invasion and Japanese massacres The Soviet Union invaded the Japanese portion of Sakhalin on August 11, 1945, resulting in the death of 20,000 civilians (see Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War (1945)). In the confusion that ensued, a rumour began to spread that ethnic Koreans could be serving as spies for the Soviet Union, and led to massacres of Koreans by Japanese police and civilians. Despite the generally limited amount of information about the massacres, two examples of massacres are comparatively well-known today: the incident in Kamishisuka (now Leonidovo) on August 18, 1945, and the incident in Mizuho Village (now Pozharskoye), which lasted from August 20 to August 23, 1945. In Kamishisuka, the Japanese police arrested 19 Koreans on charges of spy activities; 18 were found shot within the police station the next day. Has photos. The sole survivor, a Korean known only by his Japanese name Nakata, had survived by hiding in a toilet; he later offered testimony about the event. In Mizuho Village, Japanese fleeing Soviet troops who had landed at Maoka (now Kholmsk) claimed that the Koreans were cooperating with the Red Army and that they were pillaging Japanese property. Though Koreans and Japanese worked alongside each other in the village on farms and construction projects, the Japanese civilians turned against their Korean neighbors, killing 27 between August 20 and 23. Other individual Koreans may have been killed to cover up evidence of Japanese atrocities committed during the evacuation: one woman interviewed by a US-Russian joint commission investigating the issue of Allied prisoners of war held by the Imperial Japanese Army in camps on Sakhalin reported that her ethnic Korean lover had been murdered by Japanese troops after he had witnessed mass shootings of hundreds of American prisoners of war.  Integration into the Soviet Union   Repatriation refused  In the years after the Soviet invasion, most of the 400,000 Japanese civilians who had not already been evacuated during the war left voluntarily under the auspices of the US-USSR Agreement on Repatriation of those left in the USSR, signed in December 1946. Many of the 150,000 Koreans on the island safely returned to mainland Japan, and some went to the northern half of the Korean peninsula; however, roughly 43,000 were not accepted for repatriation by Japan, and also could not be repatriated to the southern half of the Korean peninsula due to the political situation. The Soviet government initially had drawn up plans to repatriate the Koreans along with the Japanese, but the local administration on Sakhalin objected, arguing that incoming Russians from the mainland would not be sufficient to replace the skilled labourers who had already departed. The indecision about the ultimate fate of the Sakhalin Koreans persisted until the outbreak of the Korean War, after which repatriation became a political impossibility. Some sources claim Stalin himself blocked their departure because he wanted to retain them as coal miners on the island. In 1957, Seoul appealed for Tokyo's assistance to secure the departure of ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin via Japan, but Tokyo took no real action on the request, and blamed Soviet intransigence for the lack of progress in resolving the issue; Japan continued its earlier policy of granting entrance only to Sakhalin Koreans who were married to Japanese citizens, or had a Japanese parent. During the late 1940s, the ranks of ethnic Koreans on the island were augmented by another 8,000 North Korean expatriates, recruited by the Soviet government to work in state-owned fisheries. In an effort to integrate the Korean labourers, who were unfamiliar with the Soviet system and unable to speak Russian, local authorities set up schools using the Korean language as the medium of instruction. However, the Sakhalin Koreans were believed to have been \\"infected with the Japanese spirit\\", and so for the most part the authorities did not trust them to run any of their own collective farms, mills, factories, schools, or hospitals. Instead, these tasks were left to several hundred ethnic Koreans imported from Central Asia, who were bilingual in Russian and Korean. Resentment towards the social dominance of Koreans from Central Asia over the Sakhalin Koreans led to tensions between the two groups; the latter developed a number of disparaging terms in Korean to refer to the former. The Sakhalin government's policy towards the Sakhalin Koreans continued to shift in line with bilateral relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union. During the 1950s, North Korea demanded that the Soviets treat Sakhalin Koreans as North Korean citizens, and, through their consulate, even set up study groups and other educational facilities for them (analogous to Chongryon's similar, more successful efforts among the Zainichi Koreans). During the late 1950s, it became increasingly difficult for the Sakhalin Koreans to obtain Soviet citizenship, and a growing proportion chose instead to become North Korean citizens rather than to deal with the burdens of remaining stateless, which included severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the requirement to apply for permission from the local government in order to travel outside of Sakhalin. As of 1960, only 25% had been able to secure Soviet citizenship; 65% had declared North Korean citizenship, with the remaining 10% choosing to remain unaffiliated despite the difficulties this entailed. However, as relations between the Soviet Union and North Korea deteriorated, the authorities acted to de-emphasise Korean language education and reduce the influence of North Korea within the community; by the early 1970s, Sakhalin Koreans were once again encouraged to apply for Soviet citizenship.  Attention from the outside world  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the situation of the Sakhalin Koreans improved as the outside world began to pay much more attention to their situation. Starting in 1966, Park No Hak, a former Sakhalin Korean who had earlier received permission to leave Sakhalin and settle in Japan by virtue of his having a Japanese wife, petitioned the Japanese government a total of 23 times to discuss the issue of the Sakhalin Koreans with the Soviet government. His actions inspired 500,000 South Koreans to form an organisation to work towards the repatriation of their co-ethnics; in response, the South Korean began radio broadcasts targeted at the Sakhalin Koreans, in an effort to assure them that they had not been forgotten. At the same time, Rei Mihara, a Tokyo housewife, formed a similar pressure group in Japan, and 18 Japanese lawyers attempted to sue the Japanese government to force them to accept diplomatic and financial responsibility for the transportation of the Sakhalin Koreans and their return to South Korea. Additionally, the Soviet government finally began to permit the Sakhalin Koreans to naturalize. However, as many as 10% continued to refuse both Soviet and North Korean citizenship, and demanded repatriation to South Korea. By 1976, only 2,000 more of their population had been able to obtain permission to depart from Sakhalin, but that year, the Sakhalin government made a public announcement that people seeking to emigrate to South Korea could simply show up at the Immigration Office to file an application. Within a week, they had received more than 800 such applications, including some from North Korean citizens; this caused the North Korean embassy to complain to their Soviet counterparts about the new emigration policy. The Soviet authorities in the end chose for unspecified reasons to refuse to issue exit visas to most of those concerned, leading to the unusual case of public demonstrations about the refusals by Korean families. This level of open dissent provoked the authorities to completely reverse their liberalising stance towards the Sakhalin Koreans; they arrested more than 40 protestors, and in November 1976 deported them, but to North Korea rather than to the South as they desired. Further purges and intimidation of those seeking to emigrate also followed. Through to the early 1980s, locally born Korean youth, increasingly interested in their heritage, were seen as traitors by their Russian neighbours for wanting to know more about their ancestral land and for seeking to emigrate. The nadir of ethnic relations came after the 1983 shooting-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union.  Perestroika, glasnost, and the post- Soviet period   Improving relations with Japan  In 1985, Japan agreed to approve transit rights and fund the repatriation of the first generation of Sakhalin Koreans; the Soviet Union also began to liberalize their emigration laws in 1987. As of 2001, Japan spends US$1.2 million a year to fund Sakhalin Koreans' visits to Seoul. The Foreign Ministry allocated about $5 million to build a cultural centre in Sakhalin, which was intended to feature a library, an exhibition hall, Korean language classrooms, and other facilities, but , the project had not begun, causing protests among the Sakhalin Koreans. On April 18, 1990, Taro Nakayama, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated: : \\"Japan is deeply sorry for the tragedy in which these (Korean) people were moved to Sakhalin not of their own free will but by the design of the Japanese government and had to remain there after the conclusion of the war\\". Translation in Kenichi Takagi, Rethinking Japan's Postwar Compensation: Voices of Victims. tr. by Makiko Nakano. The foreign trade of Sakhalin with Japan is still roughly four times that with Korea, and Japanese companies greatly outnumber their Korean on the island. As a result, while members of the first generation still carry anti-Japanese sentiment, the younger generations have developed an interest in Japanese culture and have taken up the study of the Japanese language, much to the consternation of their elders. On October 28, 2006, a Korean student from the Sakhalin State University placed second in the All-CIS Japanese Language Students Competition.  North and South Korean influence  During the 1990s, commerce, communication, and direct flights opened up between Sakhalin and South Korea, and the two Koreas began to vie openly for influence among the Sakhalin Koreans. Television and radio programmes from both North and South Korea, as well as local programming, began to be broadcast on Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting, the only Korean television station in all of Russia. North Korea negotiated with Russia for closer economic relations with Sakhalin, and sponsored an art show in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in 2006. They have also permitted delegations of Sakhalin Koreans to visit relatives in North Korea. Scholarly studies suggest that roughly 1,000 Sakhalin Koreans have opted to repatriate to North Korea, but the rise of the South Korean economy combined with the ongoing economic and political turmoil in the North have made this option less attractive. Sakhalin Koreans have also provided assistance to refugees fleeing North Korea, either those who illegally escaped across the border, or those who escaped North Korean labour camps in Russia itself. South Korea and Japan jointly funded the building of a nursing home for elderly Sakhalin Koreans in Ansan, a suburb of Seoul, and under the auspices of the Korean Red Cross, 1,544 people had settled there and in other locations , while another 14,122 had travelled to South Korea on short-term visits at Japanese government expense. South Korean investors also began to participate in the international tenders for works contracts to develop the Sakhalin Shelf, as they are interested in the potential supply of liquefied natural gas. By the year 2000, South Korean missionaries had opened several churches, and South Koreans comprised the majority of international students at the Sakhalin State University. The Korean Residents' Association on Sakhalin, an ethnic representative body, is generally described as being pro-South Korean, analogous to Japan's Mindan. In addition to the elderly, a few younger Koreans have also chosen to move to South Korea, either to find their roots, or for economic reasons, as wages in South Korea are as much as three times those in Sakhalin. However, upon arrival, they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by the South Korean locals, despite their previous exposure to Korean culture in Sakhalin. As one returnee put it, \\"Sakhalin Koreans live in a different world than Sakhalin Russians but that world isn‚Äôt Korea\\". In general, younger Sakhalin Koreans, especially those lacking fluency in the Korean language, prefer to stay on Sakhalin. Of the 1,544 Koreans who repatriated to South Korea , nearly 10% eventually returned to Sakhalin. Conversely, some foreign students from Korea studying in Sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local Koreans, claiming that the latter looked down on them for being foreigners.  Local interethnic relations  In the late 1980s, suspicions against the Sakhalin Koreans remained. With the relaxation of internal migration controls and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russians began moving en masse back to the mainland, making ethnic Koreans an increasing proportion of the population; there were fears that they might become a majority of the island's population, and seek an autonomous republic or even independence. However, the rise of the regional economy and the cultural assimilation of the younger generations drove more than 95% of Koreans to stay in Sakhalin or move to the Russian Far East rather than leave for South Korea, as they have come to consider Russia their home country. The Sakhalin Koreans' family connections in South Korea have benefited even those who remained on Sakhalin with easier access to South Korean business and imports; trade with South Korea has brought the Sakhalin Koreans a better economic standing than the average resident of Sakhalin. By 2004, inter-ethnic relations between Russians and Koreans had improved greatly and were generally not described as being a problem on Sakhalin. However, Sakhalin Koreans who have travelled to the mainland of Russia, or have relocated to there (a population of roughly 10,000), report that they have encountered various forms of racism. Among the Koreans who remain on Sakhalin, roughly 7,000 of the original generation of settlers survive, while their locally born descendants make up the rest of the local Korean population. They are highly urbanized; half live in the administrative centre of Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk, where Koreans constitute nearly 12% of the population. Around thirty per cent of Sakhalin's thirty thousand Koreans still have not taken Russian citizenship. Unlike ethnic Russians or other local minority groups, Sakhalin Koreans are exempted from conscription, but there have been calls for this exemption to be terminated.  Culture  Personal and family names Korean surnames, when Cyrillized, may be spelled slightly differently from the romanisations used in the US; the resulting common pronunciations also differ, as can be seen in the table at right. Furthermore, Korean naming practices and Russian naming practices conflict in several important ways. While most members of the older generations of Sakhalin Koreans used Korean names, members of the younger generations favor their Russian names. However, with the increasing exposure to South Korean pop culture, some younger Koreans have named their children after characters in Korean television dramas. The use of patronymics is not widespread. In addition to Korean names, the oldest generation of Sakhalin Koreans are often legally registered under Japanese names, which they had originally adopted due to the s≈çshi-kaimei policy of the Japanese colonial era. After the Soviet invasion, the Sakhalin authorities conducted name registration for the local Koreans on the basis of the Japanese identity documents issued by the old Karafuto government; as of 2006, the Russian government uniformly refused requests for re-registration under Korean names.  Language  Due to their greater population density and expectation that they would one day be allowed to return to Korea, the Sakhalin Koreans have kept something of a sojourner mentality rather than a settler mentality, which influenced their relation to the surrounding society; even today, they tend to speak much better Korean than those who were deported to Central Asia. A weekly Korean language newspaper, the Saegoryeo Shinmun (ÏÉàÍ≥†Î†§ Ïã†Î¨∏), has been published since 1949, while Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting began operation in 1956. Korean-language television programmes are broadcast locally, but typically with Russian subtitles. Additionally, during the Soviet era, Sakhalin Koreans were often hired to act as announcers and writers for official media aimed at the Koryo-saram in Central Asia. However, unlike the Koryo-saram, the spoken Korean of Sakhalin is not very closely related to Hamgy≈èng dialect or Koryo-mar, but is instead descended from Jeolla and Gyeongsang dialects. As a result of the diplomatic situation up until the 1980s, during which South Korea had no relations with the Soviet Union, Korean-language instructional materials were provided by North Korea or developed domestically. Oddly enough, as a result, Sakhalin Koreans' writing, like that of Koryo-saram, follows the North Korean standard, but their spoken Korean in radio broadcasts has come to resemble the Seoul dialect of South Korea.  Religion  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there has been significant growth in religious activities among the Sakhalin Koreans; the establishment of churches was noted in scholarly articles as early as 1990. Christian hymns have become popular listening material, supplementing the more typical Russian, Western, and Korean pop music. Korean churches also broadcast religious content through Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting; a Baptist church run by ethnic Koreans sponsors a journalist there. However, large-scale religious events can be subjected to restriction by the government authorities: in June 1998 the local Russian Orthodox Church and the regional administration of Sakhalin successfully pressured Korean Presbyterian missionaries to cancel a conference of more than 100 Presbyterian and other Protestant missionaries from around the former Soviet Union. Ethnic Koreans are numerous among the church-goers of St. James Cathedral, seat of the Apostolic Prefecture of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Catholic missions in Kholmsk and Aniva have also a fair number of Korean parishioners.  Music  In one survey, a third of the Sakhalin Korean population expressed a preference for traditional Korean music, a far higher proportion than in any other ethnic Korean community surveyed. However, despite their better knowledge of Korean language, the same survey showed that Korean pop music is less widespread among Sakhalin Koreans than among ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, possessing about the same degree of popularity as in Uzbekistan. Sakhalin Koreans also reported listening to Western popular and classical music at much lower rates than Koreans in the rest of the former Soviet Union.

A years later it was sold to Ike and Bess Berman. Apollo was known for blues (Doc Pomus), doo-wop (The Larks), gospel (Mahalia Jackson), jazz, and rock and roll. Early years In the early 1940s, the Bermans and Siegel worked at the Rainbow Record Shop on 125th Street in Harlem. They named the label after the nearby Apollo Theater. Siegel served as Apollo's first president. Initially Apollo employed three product lines that included a 300 series, featuring rhythm and blues and jazz artists, and a 100 series which was a variety of genres: gospel, calypso, and Jewish comedy. By issue #188, the 100 series shifted exclusively towards gospel. The third line, starting at #750, was dubbed \\"Jazz Masterworks\\". Apollo recorded rhythm and blues singers Dinah Washington and Wynonie Harris before they became famous on other labels. In 1946, the Bermans signed Mahalia Jackson. Although she was regarded as \\"The Queen of Gospel\\", she hadn't recorded much. When Jackson's Move On Up a Little Higher was released in January 1948, it was a hit. Overtime shifts were added to keep up with demand for the record. At an Apollo board meeting on May 27, 1948, Siegel stepped down and Bess Berman became president.\\"Apollo Names Mrs. Berman to Head Firm,\\" Billboard May 29, 1948 Berman was among few women executives in the 78 era. Ike Berman ran the pressing plant that manufactured Apollo Records. Gospel During its peak years from 1948 to 1952, Apollo concentrated on gospel music. Mahalia Jackson was Apollo's biggest seller and the artist they recorded most. Apollo also issued recordings by the Roberta Martin Singers, The Dixie Hummingbirds, The Robert Anderson Singers, The Professor Alex Bradford Singers, Harold Ivory Williams and the Ivory Gospel Singers, Rev. B. C. Campbell and his Congregation, The Daniels Singers, and The Two Gospel Keys. Rev. James Cleveland made some of his first recordings with Apollo in The Gospelaires and in The Gospel All-Stars, a session he led and arranged. Doo-wop Bess Berman was captivated by the popularity of doo-wop groups named after birds, such as The Orioles. She re-christened the Selah Jubilee Singers as The Larks and began to record them in popular material. The Larks hit number five on the R&B; chart with \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\" in 1951, but the group split up in 1952. Berman renamed the Royal Sons Quintet The \\"5\\" Royales, and their success exceeded that of The Larks'. In 1954, Apollo established a division called Lloyd's Records that was dedicated to doo-wop, adding a new version of The Larks organized under their only remaining member, Gene Mumford. Decline In 1953, Hy Siegel left to form his own company, Timely Records. In 1954, Mahalia Jackson went to Columbia Records.Broven, John - Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock n' Roll Pioneers, University of Illinois Press, 2009 The \\"5\\" Royales went to King Records. Hill & Range announced they were suing Berman, Apollo, and Lloyd's for infringement, citing 20 records where copyrighted songs by Thomas A. Dorsey and others were issued on Berman's labels and credited to Berman and Mahalia Jackson. Jackson wrote a letter denying knowledge of any such arrangement.'\\"Infringement? H&R; 18-Count Suit Versus Apollo, Lloyd,\\" Billboard, May 7, 1955 The second version of The Larks failed to chart, and in 1955 the group broke up. During the following year, Apollo ceased production of 78 rpm records and its gospel recording program, concentrating on 45s for the pop market. Apollo produced many singles in this period by groups such as the Opals, the Romeos, the Gentlemen and the Casanovas, but few of these records made money. The last popular record was \\"The Fire Burns No More\\" by the Chesters in 1957. \\"Handy Man\\" was first recorded for Apollo in 1959 by the Sparks of Rhythm but did not become a hit until lead singer Jimmy Jones recorded it for Cub Records in 1960. By that time, Apollo had stopped making recordings and was concentrating on reissues, even in the 45 market. After the Chesters renamed themselves Little Anthony and the Imperials and became stars for another record company, their Apollo releases reappeared under the name Little Anthony. In later years Solomon Burke was featured on several singles and an LP. LPs and after Apollo Records released only one or two LPs every year, starting in 1954, and these were usually reissues. It never issued a stereo recording. One of Apollo's last releases from 1962 was Mahalia Jackson's Apollo Records Requests the Honor of Your Presence at the Command Performance of Mahalia Jackson, Re- Creating Her European Concert Tour. The album consisted of recordings made for Apollo in the 1940s and early 1950s. It was packaged to look like a live recording from Jackson's 1961 tour, and to compete with the Columbia Records album Mahalia Jackson Recorded in Europe During Her Latest Concert Tour. Apollo Records closed in 1962. Over the next decade, Kenwood Records reissued most of Apollo's albums and added a few more compilations. Kenwood released a memorial album when Mahalia Jackson died in 1972. While the owner or partner in the Kenwood concern is not known, it is assumed that Bess Berman was the likely party behind this label. Although the Apollo records catalog has seen few releases in the digital era, several doo-wop compilations have been released through Relic Records since the 1980s. Some of Apollo's jazz has appeared on Delmark Records. Bess Berman died in 1997. Cash Box said in 1954 that Berman \\"was the only woman ever to break through with outstanding success in the male-dominated recording industry.\\"Broven, John - Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock n' Roll Pioneers, University of Illinois Press, 2009 Apollo Records and its affiliated publishing company, Bess Music, was purchased by George Hocutt on May 4, 1989. Shortly after that purchase in January 1990, Hocutt sold fifty percent of his interest to Couch and Madison Partners of the Malaco Music Group located in Jackson, Mississippi.

A preliminary treaty, it was used to solidify the initial armistice of 28 January between the powers.George W. Kyte (1946), \\"The Vanquished Must Surrender: Jules Favre and the Franco- German Armistice of 1871\\", Historian, 9: 19‚Äì36. It was ratified by the Treaty of Frankfurt on 10 May of the same year which made the decline of French power obvious to the rest of the continent, and at the same time demonstrated the strength of a unified German empire. Paris's governing body, the Government of National Defense had made an armistice, effective from 28 January, by surrendering to the Germans to end the siege of Paris; Jules Favre, a prominent French politician, did so, meeting with Bismarck in Versailles to sign the armistice. Adolphe Thiers emerged by the time of a formal treaty as the new French leader as the country began reconstructing its government. Disruption of the French government In the first seven weeks of the Franco-Prussian War (July 15, 1870 to September 2), Prussian and other German forces experienced several great military successes against the struggling French government, including the capture of the current French emperor, Louis Napoleon of the French Second Empire, at the Battle of Sedan. This caused the collapse of Louis Napoleon's empire, which was replaced by the French Republic of National Defense (subsequently renamed the Third Republic) in 1870. The Government of National Defense served as an interim governing body before the Third Republic could hold elections, and received unfavorable responses from Parisians as it was unable to break the siege. Statesmen evacuated to establish offices in Bordeaux and Tours, which left French government officials unable to communicate, further upsetting the structure of the state and weakening the government. German unification While the French government deteriorated, Bismarck succeeded in achieving the unification of most of Germany (aside from Austria) on January 18, 1871 creating the German Empire. King Wilhelm I of Prussia was declared Kaiser of the newly created empire in the Hall of Mirrors in the Versailles Palace. The new German command structure wanted to sign a peace treaty to gain France's colonial possessions; however, Bismarck opted for an immediate truce as his primary reason for war, German unification, had already been accomplished. He was concerned that further violence would render more German casualties and draw French resentment. He was also wary of drawing attention from other European nations, fearing that they might be moved to intervene if the new German state appeared power-hungry. Both sides were eager to sign a treaty by the beginning of February 1871. Provisions of the treaty The terms of the treaty included a war indemnity of five billion francs to be paid by France to Germany. The German army would continue to occupy parts of France until the payment was complete. The treaty also recognized Wilhelm I as the Kaiser of the newly united German Empire. Preliminary discussion began on the cession of Alsace and the Moselle region of Lorraine, to Germany. Despite Bismarck's objections, Moltke and his generals insisted that the territory was necessary as a defensive barrier. Bismarck opposed the annexation because he did not wish to make Germany a permanent enemy of France. The portion annexed of Alsace- Lorraine was later slightly reduced at the Treaty of Frankfurt, allowing France to retain the Territory of Belfort. Further reading * Abrams, Lynn.

It relies heavily on the audience for many scenes inside Mr Accousticus' house.  Plot  Summary: The story begins with young Susie/Suzy being given a puppy (Neville) as a gift from her kind mother. Her father disappeared while taking part in the Great International Balloon Race and hasn't been seen since. Soon after, Mr Constantine Accousticus moves into the large mansion across the road. Strange events occur soon after, noticed by Suzy and loyal Neville (Like birds losing their song and their neighbor Mr. Passerby, the once great opera singer losing his voice) but which are oblivious to her mother, who is too charmed by Mr Accousticus to notice what's happening around her. Early in the play we are informed that Suzy is a lonely child, because most children at her school are rather rich and their parents do not wish for them to play with children as poor as Suzy, and her mother spends all day working at a biscuit shop, so she has no time to spare with Suzy. Instead, she saves up money for a special present, and one day gives Suzy a puppy, which Suzy names Neville. Neville likes eating, and soon grows far too big to live in the small cottage with Suzy and her mother, so he is told to sleep on the porch. While here it is revealed that Suzy's mother has a problem with pronouncing words, despite being quite clever really (e.g. she says \\"Eiderdeiderdown\\" instead of Eiderdown). It is also revealed that Suzy last saw her father at the Great International Balloon Race, where he just went up, and up, and up, and never came down again, without Suzy ever getting the chance to tell him how much she loved him. The next day Suzy and Neville meet with Mr. Passerby, who claims to have been a great opera singer, named the Great Passerbi. Neither Suzy nor Neville believe him, but he always has a fresh supply of chocolate cake, which Suzy and Neville always appreciate. He explains to them that he had to quit once someone had stolen his voice late at night and replaced it with the revolting one he now has. He tells Suzy and Neville that he now sleeps with an orange beneath his chin to keep his mouth shut to prevent it happening again. Later on, Suzy and Neville discover a large, new lock on abandoned old mansion across the road. The mansion is huge, with over 50 rooms and hallways, and Suzy tells her mother, after briefly forgetting after her mother tells Suzy she has received a promotion at the biscuit shop. Suzy states that Suzy may not play in the mansion's garden anymore, as the new owner will probably dislike them playing in their garden. Later, while mother is telling Suzy and Neville a scary ghost story, their new neighbor introduces himself as Constantine Accousticus. Mother instantly falls for his charms, but Suzy and Neville are deeply afraid of him. Soon after Suzy and Neville come across Mr. Passerby, who has lost his voice again. Suzy and Neville leave him to convalesce and get him cough sweets, when they hear his voice at Mr. Accousticus' house, singing. They rush home to inform their mother, and tell her that Mr. Accousticus stole Mr. Passerby's voice, which they back up with the fact that the birds in Mr Accousticus' garden have stopped singing, which they noticed earlier in the day. Earlier in the day Mr. Accousticus told Suzy and Neville how they must always be quiet, as he has very fine hearing (He can even hear hearts beating). Mother, however, refuses to believe any of it. That night, Mr. Accousticus comes over to Suzy's little cottage, very late. Neville, already on the porch, starts barking to alert Suzy and her mother. Mr. Accousticus then steals Neville's bark. After this, Suzy and Neville devise a plan to sneak into the mansion and find out where Mr. Accousticus puts away all of his stolen voices. Once they are in the house the audience then decides which rooms the two enter, eventually leading to the heart of the house: Mr. Accousticus' study. There they find a cupboard full of the many sounds Mr. Accousticus has stolen. Here they are discovered by Mr. Accousticus who threatens to steal both their voices again, after they have just recovered Neville's bark. To escape, the open every drawer in the cupboard, releasing all the stolen sounds and causing a racket intolerably loud for Mr. Accousticus. They run back to find the mother has had her voice stolen by Mr. Accousticus, who then catches up with them and begins to steal Suzy's voice, but then, out of the blue, Father comes down in his balloon. He hits Mr. Accousticus with it, accidentally, who runs away, never to be seen again. Father explains that he has been surviving off the large supply of corned beef in his balloon and rainwater. No matter how they try, Suzy, Neville and mother are never able to convince father of what has happened, and they all live as a family again, happily ever after.  Characters  Suzy/Susie Suzy is the young heroine of the play. She is a lonely child, due to the arrogance of her classmates and the working hours of her mother. She doesn't think of herself as either brave or special, but she most certainly is both. She is very kind and polite, and very protective of Neville. Neville Neville is Suzy's loyal canine companion. He begins as a very small puppy, but due to his fondness of eating he grows into a very big dog. He also enjoys sleeping, and has a magnificent bark. He barks at everything, under the belief that he is protecting the sleeping Suzy and her mother (Although due to the constant barking, not very much sleeping takes place). He barks at moths, bats, owls, cats, and especially people coming home late from the pub. Mother Mother is very kind. She works all day at a biscuit shop to earn money for her family, and at night tells Suzy and Neville stories which she makes up herself. Despite loving her long lost husband very much, she falls for the charms of Mr. Accousticus very hard and fast. She is an excellent cook and is promoted right after Suzy and Neville discover the new lock on the mansion's door, meaning much more money for the family. Mr. Accousticus Mr. Accousticus is the charming yet very scary new neighbor to Suzy and her family. He has exquisite hearing, which is the reason he has chosen such a large house to live in (For the peace and quiet). He steals the sounds of almost everything that annoys him, including both of Mr. Passerby's voices, the bird's song and Neville's bark, which he locks away in a cupboard in his study. Mr. Passerby Mr. Passerby is Suzy's neighbor. He was once a great opera singer, named the Great Passerbi, who tends to embellish his stories. Despite once being famous and very loved, his voice was stolen by Mr. Accousticus late at night, and was replaced by a haggard one which he couldn't possibly sing opera with. He then drinks much more than is good for him and paints white lines down the center of roads. He also sleeps with an orange under his chin, before his voice is stolen again by Mr. Accousticus.

The Japanese sought to take control of their new possession, while the Republican forces fought to resist Japanese occupation. The Japanese landed near Keelung on the northern coast of Taiwan on 29 May 1895, and in a five-month campaign swept southwards to Tainan. Although their advance was slowed by guerrilla activity, the Japanese defeated the Formosan forces (a mixture of regular Chinese units and local Hakka militias) whenever they attempted to make a stand. The Japanese victory at Baguashan on 27 August, the largest battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil, doomed the Formosan resistance to an early defeat. The fall of Tainan on 21 October ended organised resistance to Japanese occupation, and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule in Taiwan. The Invasion Japanese occupation of the Pescadores A Japanese triptych woodblock print of the Japanese invasion of Taiwan, made by Toshihide Migita. Tang Jingsong (1841‚Äì1903), president of the short-lived Republic of FormosaIn 1894 China and Japan went to war. In a few short months the Japanese defeated China's Beiyang fleet, routed the Chinese armies in Manchuria, and captured Port Arthur and Weihaiwei. Although nearly all the fighting took place in northern China, Japan had important territorial ambitions in southern China. As the war approached its end, the Japanese took steps to ensure that Taiwan would be ceded to Japan under the eventual peace treaty and that they were well placed militarily to occupy the island. In March 1895 peace negotiations between Japan and China opened in the Japanese city of Shimonoseki. Although hostilities in northern China were suspended during these negotiations, Taiwan and the Pescadores were specifically excluded from the scope of the armistice. Possession of the Pescadores, lying midway between mainland China and Taiwan, was the key to a successful occupation of Taiwan. A rumour was widely circulated at this time that the Chinese authorities, realising that they were powerless to prevent Taiwan and the Pescadores falling into the hands of Japan, had offered to cede them temporarily to Britain, presumably on the understanding that they would be returned at a later date. According to this rumour, the Chinese proposal was discussed by the British cabinet, and the British prime minister Lord Rosebery and the foreign secretary Lord Kimberley refused even to consider it. Apparently, the British cabinet's reluctance to accept this poisoned chalice was based not, as has sometimes been suggested, on the fear that accepting Taiwan would immediately embroil Britain with Japan, but rather on the calculation that if Taiwan became a British colony, even temporarily, a wholesale partition of China would have followed. Although the Pescadores were garrisoned by 15 Chinese regular battalions (5,000 men) and defended by the recently completed Hsi-tai coastal defence battery (built in the late 1880s in response to the capture of Pescadores by the French during the Sino-French War), the Japanese met very little resistance during the landing operation as the defenders were demoralised. It took the Japanese only three days to secure the islands. After a naval bombardment of the Chinese forts, Japanese troops went ashore on Fisher Island (modern-day Siyu) and P'eng-hu Island on 24 March, fought several brief actions with defending Chinese troops, captured the key Hsi-tai battery and occupied Makung. In the next two days they occupied the other main islands of the Pescadores group. Japanese combat casualties were negligible, but a cholera outbreak shortly after the fall of the islands killed more than 1,500 men of the Japanese occupation force. The soldiers of the defeated Chinese garrison of the Pescadores, most of whom surrendered without a fight, were repatriated by the Japanese to mainland China. Cession of Taiwan to Japan and proclamation of Republic of Formosa The Japanese occupation of the Pescadores was of considerable strategic significance, preventing China from substantially reinforcing its garrisons in Taiwan. Having made it almost impossible for China to fight successfully for Taiwan, the Japanese pressed their claims to the island in the peace negotiations. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on 17 April 1895, and contained a clause requiring the cession of Taiwan and the Pescadores. On 10 May, Admiral Kabayama Sukenori was appointed the first Japanese governor-general of Taiwan. When the news of the treaty's contents reached Taiwan, a number of notables from central Taiwan led by Chiu Feng-chia decided to resist the transfer of Taiwan to Japanese rule. On 23 May, these men proclaimed the establishment of a free and democratic Republic of Formosa in Taipei. Tang Jingsong, the Qing governor-general of Taiwan, was prevailed upon to become the republic's first President, and his old friend Liu Yongfu, the retired Black Flag Army commander who had become a national hero in China for his victories against the French in northern Vietnam a decade earlier, was invited to serve as Grand General of the Army. Chiu Feng-chia was appointed Grand Commander of Militia, with the power to raise local militia units throughout the island to resist the Japanese. On the Chinese mainland Chang Chih-tung, the powerful governor-general of Liangkiang, tacitly supported the Formosan resistance movement, and the Republicans also appointed Ch'en Chi-t'ung, a disgraced Chinese diplomat who understood European ways of thinking, as the Republic's foreign minister. His job would be to sell the Republic abroad. There was little or no popular support in Taiwan for the proclamation of the Republic, and many Western observers considered its establishment as a cynical ploy by its authors to evade China's obligations under the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Acting under the authority of the new Republic, Chinese troops would be able to resist the Japanese in Taiwan without technically breaching the terms of the treaty, and if they were successful Taiwan could return to Chinese rule at some future date. (In this respect, it was significant that the nominally-independent Republic acknowledged the suzerainty of China.) There was therefore little sympathy in Europe for the Republic, despite its impeccably 'Parisian' manifesto. Flag of the Republic of Formosa, 1895 Nor was there any support for the Formosan resistance movement in Peking, as considerable diplomatic efforts were then underway to persuade Japan to relinquish the Liaotung Peninsula. Under the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China had agreed to cede the peninsula to Japan, but once the treaty's contents became known there was alarm in Europe at Japan's rapacity. In a diplomatic demarche known as the Triple Intervention, Russia, France and Germany put pressure on Japan in late April 1895 to restore the peninsula to China. On 5 May the Japanese agreed to retrocede the Liaotung Peninsula to China in return for an increased indemnity, but it took until December 1895 to negotiate the necessary treaty amendments, and while the negotiations were in progress Japanese troops remained in place. During this period the empress dowager and her officials had excellent reasons not to offend Japan, and the Qing court was horrified when it heard the news in mid-May that several officials in Taiwan intended to resist the Japanese occupation and that there was talk of setting up a Republic that recognised Qing suzerainty. Shortly before the proclamation of the Republic of Formosa, the Qing court ordered Li Ching-fang, the nephew and adopted son of China's elder statesman Li Hung-chang, to proceed to Taiwan and formally transfer sovereignty over the island from China to Japan. It also cabled an imperial edict to Taipei on 20 May, directing Tang Jingsong to order all Qing civil officials and all officers and soldiers to leave Taiwan. Tang himself was ordered to return to Peking. Spurned by European public opinion and disavowed by China, the Republic of Formosa enjoyed only one week of uninterrupted existence. During this time it decked itself out with the conventional trappings of sovereignty. The Republicans adopted a national flag with a yellow tiger on a blue background, ordered a large silver state seal to be made, and began to issue paper money and postage stamps in the name of the Republic. The foreign minister Ch'en Chi-t'ung, who had lived in France for many years, was responsible for crafting much of this republican symbolism. The course of the war Phase One: Keelung, Taipei and Tamsui  Ruifang and Keelung  Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa and his staff at Audi during the Japanese landing Meanwhile, the Japanese were making their preparations for occupying Taiwan in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The task of securing Japan's new colony was entrusted to the Imperial Guards Division, which had seen no action during the fighting in Manchuria. 7,000 guardsmen, under the command of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, left Port Arthur on 22 May, on board fourteen transports. The preparations for the expedition were made in such haste that there was no time to issue the guardsmen with summer uniforms, and they left for the hot and humid climate of Taiwan in the heavy winter clothes they had been wearing against the bitter cold of Manchuria. On 26 May the transports, escorted by the warships Matsushima and , reached the Japanese-owned Ryukyu Islands to the northeast of Taiwan and anchored off the port of Nakagusuku on the eastern coast of Okinawa. On 27 May the recently appointed governor-general of Formosa, Admiral Kabayama Sukenori, joined the expedition from Tokyo. In view of the reports that had reached Japan that the leaders of the self-styled Republic of Formosa were making preparations to resist a Japanese landing, Kabayama felt that there was no time to lose. In consequence, he ordered the ships to set sail for Taiwan at noon the same day. On 29 May the first troops of the Imperial Guards Division went ashore on the northern coast of Taiwan at Samtiao Point near the village of Audi (a small village in Gongliao), several miles to the east of Keelung. The Japanese had originally intended to land at Tamsui, but finding the town strongly defended changed their plans at the last moment. The landing marked the beginning of the war. The first major engagement took place on 2 June at Sui-hong (Ruifang). The defending Chinese forces were defeated. On 3 June the Japanese captured the port city of Keelung. Following a preliminary bombardment of the city's coastal defences by the warships Matsushima, Oshima, , Takachiho and Chiyoda, the Imperial Guards attacked the Keelung forts from the rear. The main struggle took place around the Shih-ch'iu-ling battery (). Eleven years earlier, during the Sino-French War, Chinese forces had bottled up a French expeditionary corps in Keelung for seven months during the Keelung Campaign, and the Shih-ch'iu-ling battery had been held against the French for most of the war. Now, in 1895, the Japanese routed the fort's garrison and captured the fort with little loss. Keelung was occupied on the afternoon of 3 June, after the Qing commanders fled the city and left the garrison force leaderless. Japanese casualties in the battle for Keelung were 2 dead and 26 wounded.  Transfer of sovereignty  While the fighting raged ashore at Keelung, sovereignty over Taiwan was formally transferred from China to Japan at a ceremony held on the morning of 3 June aboard one of the Japanese warships in Keelung harbour. Japan and China were represented at this ceremony by two plenipotentiaries, Governor-General Kabayama for Japan and Li Ching-fang (the adopted son of Li Hung-chang) for China. Li Hung-chang's numerous enemies had arranged that the obnoxious task of presiding over the surrender of Taiwan to the Japanese should be thrust upon his son's shoulders. The occasion was profoundly humiliating for Li. The Japanese had hoped to stage the handover ceremony ashore, in the capital Taipei, but Li soon discovered that he would be lucky to escape with his life if he set foot on Taiwanese soil. As the negotiator of the Treaty of Shimonoseki that handed over Taiwan to Japan, Li Hung-chang was detested by the islanders, and they were now furious to learn that his son had been entrusted with the task of formally ceding Chinese sovereignty over the island. Placards were posted up in towns all over Taiwan vowing eternal hatred to Li Hung-chang and his family, and Li Ching-fang was forced to beg the Japanese to hold the transfer ceremony at sea rather than ashore. The Japanese granted this request.  Tang Jingsong's flight  When the news of the defeat at Keelung reached Taipei on 4 June, the republican leaders promptly abandoned ship. During the night of 4 June President Tang and General Chiu fled to Tamsui, and from there sailed for the mainland on the evening of 6 June aboard the steamship Arthur. Their departure was delayed for a day because of disorder in Tamsui (see below).  Japanese occupation of Taipei  Japanese troops occupy Taipei, 7 June 1895 Leaderless and without pay, the troops of the Taipei garrison abandoned their posts and began looting the city. The city's powder magazine was fired, and there were several fatal shootings. Alarmed at the growing chaos, a number of local businessmen, including the influential Koo Hsien-jung, decided to invite the Japanese in. On Koo's initiative, three representatives of the city's foreign community left Taipei, intending to make contact with the Japanese forces in Keelung and urge them to enter Taipei to restore order. The foreign envoys met a Japanese force at Tsui-tng-ka (Xizhi) on 6 June, and when he learned of the growing disorder in Taipei the Japanese commander immediately ordered an advance to occupy the city. The first Japanese troops entered Taipei at dawn on 7 June, and during the next two days put down the riots. Most of the Chinese soldiers in Taipei surrendered their weapons without resistance.  Japanese occupation of Tamsui  Hobe Fort, Tamsui During the first week of June, while the Japanese were securing Keelung and advancing on Taipei, law and order broke down in Tamsui. On 5 June Tang Jingsong and several senior ministers boarded the steamship Arthur at Tamsui, intending to escape to mainland China, and it was rumoured that they had with them large sums of money owed in pay to the Chinese garrisons of the northern towns. Large numbers of Chinese soldiers in flight from Keelung had poured into Tamsui on 4 June, and on 5 June a party of soldiers boarded the steamship and extorted $45,000 from its passengers. The money was distributed among the various infantry units present in Tamsui. On the evening of 5 June the gunners of Tamsui's Hobe Fort, indignant that they had been left out of this distribution of spoils, threatened to fire on the steamship unless a suitable bribe was found. The European employees of the Maritime Customs raised the sum demanded ($5,000) during the night and handed it over to the gunners in return for the breechblocks of the fort's four Krupp cannon. The Hobe Fort, the 'lock and key of the northern gate' (ÂåóÈñÄÈéñÈë∞) as the Chinese called it, had been built only a few years earlier at great expense by the Chinese governor Liu Ming-ch'uan. (citation) It was now effectively disarmed before it had even fired a shot at the Japanese. During the afternoon of 6 June Arthur got up steam and attempted to leave Tamsui, as her captain believed that it was now safe to do so, but was fired on several times by a Chinese field battery. Around fifty Chinese soldiers aboard the steamship were wounded by the exploding shells and several soldiers were killed, including the captain of Tang Jingsong's bodyguard. The German gunboat , which had been sent to Tamsui to protect the town's European residents, immediately replied, putting the Chinese battery out of action. Arthur left Tamsui that evening with Tang Jingsong and most of the senior officers of the republic on board. The Chinese troops in Tamsui now began to loot the town, singling out the wealthy foreign residences for immediate attention, but the presence of Iltis and the British gunboat deterred them from making physical attacks upon the foreigners. Order was only restored with the arrival of the Japanese. On 7 June two Japanese warships entered Tamsui harbour, and their appearance immediately put an end to the looting. On 8 June eighteen Japanese cavalry troopers advanced northwards from Taipei and occupied Tamsui without firing a shot, taking the surrender of several hundred Chinese soldiers.  Political developments  On 14 June, Admiral Kabayama arrived in Taipei, and announced the establishment of Japanese administration in Taiwan. With northern Taiwan now firmly under their control, the Japanese repatriated the thousands of Chinese soldiers captured at Keelung, Taipei and Tamsui during the brief campaign. Japanese transports ferried them across the Formosa Strait and landed them in the Fukienese port of Amoy. The first phase of the campaign had seen the flight of the Republican president Tang Jingsong, the Japanese occupation of Keelung, Taipei and Tamsui and the surrender of the Republican garrisons in northern Taiwan. It was generally expected, both by the Japanese and by foreign observers, that resistance to the Japanese occupation of Taiwan would now evaporate. The American war correspondent James W. Davidson commented: > At 2 a.m. on 5 June the yellow Republican Tiger gathered in his long tail > and laid down and died for lack of nourishment. Hopes for an early end to the war proved to be premature. By the end of June it was clear that all the island's main towns would have to be occupied forcibly before opposition to the Japanese invasion collapsed. Popular resistance to the Japanese invasion gradually grew, slowing the pace of their advance south from Taipei, and on 26 June the presidency of the Formosan Republic was assumed by Liu Yongfu in Tainan. This gesture, which effectively transferred the republican capital from Taipei to Tainan, prolonged the Republic's life for another five months. Phase Two: Hsinchu, Miaoli and Changhua The capture of Tainan now became a political as well as a strategic imperative for the Japanese. However, this proved to be easier said than done. Faced with growing resistance to their occupation, the Japanese were unable to advance immediately on Tainan. During the second phase of the campaign, from June to August, the Japanese secured central Taiwan by occupying Miaoli and Changhua. They then paused for a month, and only embarked on the third and final phase of the campaign, the advance on Tainan, in October.  Japanese capture of Hsinchu  On 11 June the Imperial Guards Division left Taipei and began to advance south. Its immediate objectives were Tokoham (Daxi District) and Tek-cham (Hsinchu). The Japanese captured Hsinchu with little trouble on 22 June. The Chinese troops of the Hsinchu garrison removed their uniforms and handed over their weapons to the Japanese as soon as they entered the city.  Formosan militia operations around Hsinchu  So far, the Japanese had been fighting Qing regular troops, most of whom wanted merely to leave the alien soil of Taiwan and return to mainland China as soon as possible. They had little stomach for fighting the Japanese, and made no attempt to defeat them when they did fight. James Davidson, who had seen their qualities for himself at Keelung, Taipei, Tamsui and Hsinchu, was scathing in his criticism of their performance: > The Chinese troops equipped with good weapons or bad, without drill, and > unskilled in foreign tactics, protected by magnificent forts with big modern > guns, or behind mudwalls with jingals, conducted themselves always with > scarcely a redeeming feature. Their forces never advanced to make an attack > unless they were confident that their position permitted of an easy retreat > and that they greatly outnumbered their opponents. I know of hardly a single > instance where, in the clearing, they have held their own against an > approaching force, under anywhere near equal conditions. It is a usual > manoeuvre for the Chinese to draw themselves up in mighty splendour on some > open plot of ground in full view of the enemy, and should the latter advance > towards them, to commence to fire off every available firearm, although they > may be entirely out of range. This continues until the enemy has advanced > sufficiently near to make his bullets felt in the Chinese ranks, and then > there is a scatter and a scramble for a safer position, where their forces > rally again to repeat the same tactics as before. After the fall of Hsinchu, however, locally recruited Formosan troops began to take the lead in the fighting against the Japanese. In particular, Hakka militia units led by the youthful commanders Chiang Shao-tsu (ÂßúÁ¥πÁ•ñ), Wu Tang- hsing (Âê≥ÊπØËàà) and Hsu Hsiang (ÂæêÈ©§) put up a stubborn resistance to the Japanese advance. Between 24 and 26 June the Japanese had to turn back to An-ping-chin and fight a major engagement to capture the heights of Shih-pa-chien-shan (Traditional Chinese: ÂçÅÂÖ´Â∞ñÂ±±). The Japanese, with superior training and better weapons, eventually succeeded in throwing the Formosans off the mountain. But although defeated, the Formosans remained for several days in the vicinity of Hsinchu, demonstrating on more than one occasion against the city. On 10 July the Japanese again confronted the Hakka militias, this time on the heights of Chienbishan (Traditional Chinese: Â∞ñÁ≠ÜÂ±±) near Miaoli. The Formosans were entrenched, but had no modern artillery. The Japanese attacked from two sides and defeated them. Japanese casualties were only 11 killed or wounded, while the bodies of 200 dead Formosans were recovered from the battlefield. The Japanese also took 110 prisoners, one of whom was the 19-year-old militia leader Chiang Shao-tsu. On 11 July, Chiang committed suicide by taking opium. Wu Tang-hsing thereupon assumed command of the Hakka militias, and on 23 July led them back in retreat to Miaoli.  Guerrilla operations behind Japanese lines  In June and July 1895, while Formosan militia units disputed the Japanese advance on the battlefield, groups of Formosan insurgents began to attack isolated couriers and small groups of Japanese soldiers on the routes between Taipei and Hsinchu, behind Japanese lines. The attackers were often villagers who had formally submitted on the approach of Japanese columns, and foreign observers severely condemned their abuse of the white flag: > The greatest obstacle that the Japanese encountered was the smiling > villagers who stood in their doorways, over which they had flown a white > flag, watching the troops pass by. For these natives the Japanese had at > first a kind word and a smile. But scarcely were the troops out of sight > before guns were brought out through the same doorways and shots fired at > the first unfortunate party whose numbers were sufficiently small to make it > appear safe to the treacherous occupants. Troops now return and find the > mutilated bodies of their companions in the streets; while at the doors and > windows of the houses near, are the same grinning fiends and the same little > white flag, an emblem of peace, still floating over their guilty heads. The Japanese took brutal reprisals whenever such incidents occurred, shooting suspected villagers and burning down whole villages.

Accessed 2010-11-03 One of the most successful insurgent attacks was made on 11 July on a party of 35 Japanese infantrymen who were conveying supplies by boat from Taipei to Tokoham. The Japanese were ambushed, and although they fought bravely, all but one of the party were either killed or so badly wounded that they committed suicide rather than fall alive into the hands of the enemy. The Japanese pursued the insurgents and defeated them on 12 July in an engagement at Long-tampo. During the last week in July the Japanese twice despatched coordinated expeditions from Taipei, Tokoham and Haisoankau to clear Formosan guerrillas away from their supply lines, engaging large insurgent forces at Sankakeng (modern-day Sanxia) on 22 and 23 July and at Sinpu on 2 August. During both sweeps the Japanese inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents and suffered relatively few casualties in return.  Japanese capture of Miaoli  On 6 August the Imperial Guards Division left Hsinchu and advanced towards Miaoli. On 6 and 7 August two Japanese columns drove Formosan insurgent forces away from Hsinchu, occupying the resistance centre of Peipo (Beipu). On 8 and 9 August the Japanese fought a major battle to drive a large force of insurgents from a series of strong positions on the heights of Cha-pi-shan, to the north of Tiongkang. On 11 August the Japanese occupied Aulang. On 13 August they fought another battle, against stubborn Formosan resistance, to dislodge a force of insurgents from the hilltop position of Chenkansoan. On 14 August the Japanese entered Miaoli county. There was no resistance, as most of the population had fled. Japanese victory at Baguashan and capture of Changhua The next major Japanese objective on the route south was the walled city of Changhua. The Formosans were reported to have massed their forces there to fight a major defensive battle, and Liu Yongfu was said to have reinforced the Formosan militia with a number of elite Black Flag units from his southern army. The capture of Changhua was a formidable proposition for the Japanese. The heights of Baguashan, to the north of the city, were fortified, and defended by a strong artillery position, the Bagua battery (Traditional Chinese: ÂÖ´Âç¶Á†≤Âè∞). During the third week of August the Japanese brought up supplies and made preparations for what they expected to be the decisive battle of the campaign. The Japanese resumed their advance from Miaoli on 24 August, occupying the large village of Koloton on 24 August. On 25 August, continuing their advance towards the Toa- to-kei river to the north of Changhua, the Japanese were ambushed by a large insurgent force in the fortified village of Tokabio. The Japanese fought all day to clear the insurgents from their line of advance, but the village was not completely cleared until the morning of 26 August. During the evening of 26 August the Japanese closed up to the Toa-to-kei river and prepared to assault the Formosan positions around Changhua. During the night of 26 August, the Japanese crossed the Toa-to-kei river under cover of darkness, and at dawn on 27 August separate Japanese columns made a surprise attack on the Bagua battery and Changhua. In a short and sharp early morning engagement generally known as the Battle of Baguashan, the Japanese stormed the Bagua battery and occupied Changhua. The Formosans suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and two of their commanders, Wu Tang-hsing (Âê≥ÊπØËàà) and Wu Peng-nien (Âê≥ÂΩ≠Âπ¥), were killed. The Formosan forces fell back to Chiayi and Lu-kang. The battle of Baguashan, the largest pitched battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil, was the decisive engagement of the invasion, and its loss doomed the Formosan Republic to early defeat. Subsequent engagements merely postponed the end.WTFM CLAN ÈÅî‰∫∫ 1895 Ëá∫ÁÅ£Áç®Á´ãÊà∞Áà≠ The battle was an impressive Japanese victory, and foreign observers praised the courage and skill with which the Japanese troops had captured such a strong position so quickly. For the Japanese, the opportunity to defeat the Formosans in the open field was welcomed after the weeks of guerrilla fighting they had experienced since the start of their march south from Taipei. The battle put an end to organized resistance against the Japanese in central Taiwan. However, the Japanese declined to follow up their victory immediately. After securing the coastal port of Lu-kang and the town of Perto at the end of August, the Imperial Guards temporarily halted their advance. During September they consolidated their positions around Changhua and awaited the arrival of substantial reinforcements from Japan at the beginning of October. During this lull in the campaign, a severe outbreak of malaria at Changhua ravaged the Japanese forces, killing more than 2,000 men. Japanese capture of Talibu The only significant military action in central Taiwan during the weeks following the Japanese capture of Changhua was a series of engagements in early September around Yunlin. On 3 September the insurgents attacked the small Japanese garrison of the village of Toapona, to the south of Changhua. Japanese reinforcements came up, and the insurgents were defeated and retreated towards Yunlin. A Japanese infantry company in the vicinity attacked the retreating insurgents and during the evening of 3 September pursued them as far as the walled city of Talibu, whose defences it scouted. Three days later, during the night of 5 September, the Japanese returned and made a surprise night attack on Talibu. The Japanese vanguard scaled the city walls and opened the gates for its comrades, who poured into the city firing volleys. The Chinese garrison fled in confusion, and by 5 a.m. on 6 September Talibu was securely occupied by the Japanese. Chinese and Formosan losses during these few days of fighting amounted to 130 killed, while Japanese losses were only eight men killed and wounded. Phase Three: Chiayi, Takow and Tainan  A three-pronged advance  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) The Japanese resumed their advance on Tainan in the second week of October. The arrival of strong reinforcements (the 2nd Provincial Division, transferred from the Japanese 2nd Army in Manchuria, and part of the 4th Provincial Division, from Osaka) allowed them to approach Tainan from three directions at once. On 10 October two task forces sailed from the Pescadores. The smaller task force, 5,460 troops under the command of Prince Fushimi Sadanaru, landed at Po-te-chui () (modern-day Budai, Chiayi), to the north of Tainan. The larger task force, 6,330 troops under the command of Lieutenant- General Nogi Maresuke, landed at Pang-liau (Fangliao), to the south of Takow and well to the south of Tainan. Its first objective was to capture the port of Takow. Meanwhile, the Imperial Guards Division, then at Changhua, was ordered to continue to press forward towards Tainan. The division, 14,000 strong when it landed in Taiwan at the end of May, had been so reduced by sickness that it could now only with difficulty put 7,000 men into the field. Nevertheless, the Japanese now had the numbers to make an end of the campaign. Just under 20,000 Japanese troops would now close in on Tainan simultaneously, from the north, the northeast and the south. Liu Yongfu could probably field a larger force, but the Chinese and Formosans were by now fighting merely to stave off defeat. They had little hope of stemming the Japanese advance on Tainan.  Japanese capture of Yunlin and Chiayi  The Imperial Guards Division commenced its march south from Changhua on 3 October. On 6 October the division‚Äôs advance guard defeated a force of 3,000 insurgents at Talibu. On 7 October the division fought an important action with the insurgents at Yunlin, driving them from a series of fortified positions. On 9 October the division fought the second-largest battle of the campaign, the Battle of Chiayi, to storm the walled city of Chiayi, where the insurgents had decided to make a determined stand. According to report, the Chinese and Formosans numbered 10,000 men and included both regular and volunteer units. The true figure was probably around 3,000 men, but the insurgents were stiffened by a force of 600 Black Flags, who now fought the Japanese for the first time during the campaign, and also deployed cannon and machine guns on the city walls. After a preliminary bombardment with their mountain artillery the Japanese scaled the walls and broke into the city. The insurgents were defeated, leaving over 200 dead on the field. Total casualties in the Imperial Guards Division in the engagements fought between 3 and 9 October were 14 killed and 54 wounded. The division was ordered to halt at Chiayi and wait until Prince Fushimi‚Äôs northern expedition went ashore at Pa-te-chui before resuming its advance.  Liu Yongfu's conditional surrender offer  On 10 October, discouraged by the news of the fall of Chiayi, Liu Yongfu made an offer of conditional surrender to the Japanese. He asked that no Formosan should be punished for having taken up arms against the Japanese, and that all Chinese soldiers still in Taiwan should be treated hospitably and repatriated to Canton or Amoy. The surrender offer was conveyed to the Japanese headquarters at Makung in the Pescadores by the British warship HMS Pique, and the Japanese replied that they would send a warship to Anping, the outport of Tainan, on 12 October to discuss Liu's proposals. On 12 October the Japanese cruiser Yoshino arrived off Anping, but Liu Yongfu refused to go aboard, perhaps fearing treachery. The Japanese subsequently informed him that they would accept only unconditional surrender.  Japanese victory at Shau-lan  Fleet Admiral His Imperial Highness Prince Yorihito Higashi-Fushimi Meanwhile, the other two Japanese columns were making their presence felt. Prince Fushimi's northern column, which included the 5th and 17th Infantry Regiments, landed at Pa-te-chui on 10 October. The division fought several brisk actions during its advance southwards. These included an action at Kaw- wah-tau on 12 October, in which Japanese casualties were slight, and an engagement near Kiu-sui-kei on 16 October to disengage a company of the 17th Regiment which had been surrounded by the insurgents, in which the Japanese suffered casualties of 9 dead and 10 wounded and the enemy at least 60 dead. On 18 October the 5th Infantry Regiment, supported by a battery of artillery and a troop of cavalry, routed the insurgents at Ongo-ya-toi. Japanese casualties were 3 dead and 14 wounded, while the enemy left 80 dead on the battlefield. On the same day the 17th Regiment met the Formosans at Tion-sha and inflicted a heavy defeat upon them. Formosan losses were computed at around 400 killed, while on the Japanese side only one officer was wounded. Meanwhile, the brigade‚Äôs advance guard dislodged an insurgent force numbering around 4,000 men and armed with repeating rifles from the village of Mao-tau, to the south of the So-bung-go River, but suffered relatively high casualties in doing so. On 19 October, in a battle to capture the fortified village of Shau-lan, the Japanese took a striking revenge. The 17th Regiment trapped a force of 3,000 insurgents inside the village and inflicted very heavy casualties on them when they stormed it. Nearly a thousand enemy bodies were counted after this massacre. Japanese losses were only 30 men killed or wounded, including 3 officers.  Japanese capture of Takow  Lieutenant- General Nogi's southern column, consisting of 6,330 soldiers, 1,600 military coolies and 2,500 horses, landed at Fangliao on 10 October, and engaged a force of Formosan militiamen at Ka-tong-ka (; now Jiadong) on 11 October. The Battle of Chiatung was a Japanese victory, but the Japanese suffered their heaviest combat casualties of the campaign in the engagement‚Äî16 men killed and 61 wounded. Three officers were among the casualties. On 15 October Nogi's column closed in on the important port of Takow, but discovered that the Japanese navy had beaten it to the punch. Two days earlier, on 13 October, the Takow forts had been bombarded and silenced by the Japanese cruisers Yoshino, , , Hiei, Yaeyama and Saien, and a naval landing force had been put ashore to occupy the town. Foiled of their prize, Nogi's men pressed on, and captured the town of Pithau on 16 October. By 20 October they were at the village of Ji-chang-hang, only a few miles south of Tainan. There, on the night of 20 October, they received an offer of unconditional surrender from the Chinese merchants of Tainan.  Liu Yongfu's flight  All three Japanese columns were now within striking distance of Tainan, and on 20 October, realising that the war was lost, Liu Yongfu disguised himself as a coolie and fled to Amoy in mainland China aboard the British merchant ship SS Thales. The ship was pursued by the Japanese cruiser Yaeyama and boarded by Japanese sailors, who did not recognise Liu Yongfu but arrested him and several of his companions on suspicion. The British captain protested vigorously at this illegal search, and when the merchant ship reached Amoy the detainees, including Liu Yongfu, were released. Admiral Arichi Shinanojo, the Japanese fleet commander in the invasion of Taiwan, was forced to resign as a result of a subsequent British complaint to Japan. Only later did the Japanese realise how close they had come to capturing Liu.  Capitulation of Tainan  Tainan capitulated to the Japanese on 21 October. Its capture put an end to serious Formosan resistance and effectively inaugurated the era of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan. Historian and politician Takekoshi gave the following account of the surrender of Tainan: > After General Liu's flight, the remains of his party wandered about the city > not knowing what to do, until the foreigners, afraid that they would begin > plundering, managed to persuade them to lay down their arms. This operation > took the whole of one day, between 7,000 and 8,000 rifles being eventually > placed in secure custody. Then two English missionaries, Messrs. Fergusson > and Barclay, went to the Japanese headquarters a few miles south of the > city, bearing a letter from the Chinese residents saying that the soldiers > had all laid down their arms and disappeared, and asking the Japanese to > come quickly and enforce order. General Nogi entered the city on 21 October > and the rest of the army soon followed. Thus Formosa came into our > possession in reality as well as in name.  Casualties  Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa (1847‚Äì95) Japanese combat casualties in the invasion of Taiwan were relatively light: 164 officers and men killed and 515 wounded. Casualties from disease, particularly cholera and malaria, were far higher. The cholera outbreak in the Pescadores at the end of March 1895 killed more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers, and an even higher number of Japanese soldiers died in September 1895 in the wake of the malaria outbreak at Changhua shortly after its fall to the Japanese. According to Japanese sources, 4,642 soldiers died in Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands of disease. By the end of the campaign, 5,246 Japanese soldiers had been hospitalised in Taiwan and a further 21,748 soldiers had been evacuated back to Japan for treatment. Japanese casualties from disease included Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, who fell ill with malaria on 18 October. His condition rapidly worsened and he died in Tainan on 28 October, seven days after the city's capitulation to the Japanese. His body was carried to Anping, the port of Tainan, by a troop of wrestlers who by special imperial permission had accompanied the Imperial Guards Division, and shipped back to Japan for burial aboard the steamer Saikio Maru. The cruiser Yoshino escorted the prince's body back to Japan. A story widely circulated in Taiwan at the time, that the cause of the prince's death was a wound he received during the Battle of Baguashan, is quite untrue. Chinese and Formosan casualties were far higher, but are difficult to estimate. The Japanese recovered the dead bodies of around 7,000 enemy soldiers from the various battlefields of the war, and the total number of Chinese and Formosan dead has been estimated at around 14,000.

The last Formosan militia units still under arms were defeated on 26 November 1895 at the Battle of Changhsing, popularly known in Taiwan as the Battle of the Burning Village. During this battle Japanese troops set alight and stormed the village of Changhsing, Pingtung, against determined resistance by a force of Hakka militiamen and armed Hakka villagers under the command of Chiu Feng-yang (ÈÇ±È≥≥Êèö). The surviving Formosans dispersed after this defeat. Japan had won its title to Taiwan and the Pescadores with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the successful Japanese invasion of Taiwan confirmed the Japanese in their possession. Taiwan remained firmly under the control of Japan until 1945, and all regular units of the Chinese army still on the island were either disbanded or shipped back to China. Businessmen who had backed the Japanese during the invasion prospered under their rule. Koo Hsien-jung, who had invited the Japanese into Taipei in the early days of June 1895, was granted exclusive business rights in Taiwan, making him the wealthiest Taiwanese of his time. His son Koo Chen-fu inherited his wealth and founded the Koos Group, which dominated the business sector of modern Taiwan. Although the Japanese army had defeated the Chinese regular and Formosan militia forces with little difficulty, a number of locally raised guerrilla bands maintained an insurgency against the Japanese for the next seven years. The insurgency initially flourished because the bulk of the invasion force was repatriated after the surrender of Tainan, so that for several months there were relatively few Japanese troops left on the ground in Taiwan. The Japanese responded to the continuing resistance with a carefully calibrated 'stick and carrot' policy, granting clemency to insurgents who laid down their arms while hunting down and annihilating those that did not, and taking brutal reprisals against villages believed to be sheltering guerrillas. Nitobe Inaz≈ç, a former Director of the Bureau of Industries in the Government of Formosa, wrote, \\"Though the island was pacified no one knew what was to happen next. We did not understand the character of the people. Very few Japanese could speak Formosan and fewer Formosans could speak Japanese. There was naturally mutual distrust and suspicion. The bandits abounded everywhere. Under these conditions military rule was the only form of government that could be adopted until better assurance could be obtained of the disposition of the people. For this purpose it was calculated that some ten million yen, I may say five million dollars, was yearly needed for the pacification and government of Formosa.\\" Deaths in battle and illness plagued the Japanese forces and resulted in heavy losses for them. By 1902 most of the Formosan guerrilla units had either been wiped out or had surrendered, but a Hakka guerrilla band led by the Hakka remained a thorn in the side of the Japanese. Lin continued to harass the Japanese, and he and his men were eventually hunted down and killed in a major engagement on 30 May 1902. In Japanese eyes, the extermination of Lin's band marked the end of the 'pacification' process in Taiwan, though low-level violence continued for several years thereafter.Internet biography of Lin Shao-mao Cultural Influence The 1895 war between the Japanese and the Formosan resistance movement was portrayed in a Hakka language film called 1895, released in November 2008.

The league was created by David McLane, who had previously created the World Roller Hockey League. It lasted three seasons, 1998, 1999 and 2000. PBH games were played with a ball instead of a puck on an outdoor rink on the beach at Huntington Beach, California. The season lasted slightly less than two months in the early summer. Games were taped during the short season and aired on ESPN2 from June to September. The league is infamous for having ramps behind the nets to \\"increase speed,\\" angled glass sections attached to the top of the dasher board glass to redirect the ball back into play and a 2-point line that was treated much like basketball's 3 point line. The first taped events were shot in May 1998 and televised later on ESPN in an attempt to reach the younger audience. Cheerleaders and bands performed turning the tapings into an event. The team uniform designs were memorable for their bright, colorful designs that some observers have laughed at. Hockey fans appreciated that PBH kept the sport alive on television during summer months. PBH players were mostly Roller Hockey International (RHI) players, several of which had previous National Hockey League (NHL) experience. The players were paid from a bonus pool depending on how each team finished each season. Web Warriors won the first PBH championship, named The James J. Allegro Cup, over Dawg Pac, two games to none. Xpress won the second PBH championship in 1999 over Heavy Metal, two games to one. Web Warriors won the final PBH championship in 2000.

Located on the York to Scarborough Line it was opened on 5 July 1845 by the York and North Midland Railway. The Y&NMR; became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1854 which in turn became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. It closed on 22 September 1930. Bradshaws timetable for summer 1927 showed 15 trains in each direction on a weekday with two services on a Sunday. Trains operated between York and Flaxton railway station and a number of these were operated by a bus mounted on rail wheels. The initial rail bus was first put into service in 1922 and was based on the road buses operated by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in the Durham area. An additional driving position was fitted to the back and additional doors were fitted in the centre of the bus. The bus could seat 26 passengers and was initially numbered 110. This conflicted with another NER carriage number and was subsequently renumbered to Y130. In July 1923 Y130 was moved to Selby and a new rail motor (number 2130) started work. This was a slightly bigger vehicle seating 30 passengers, being long and weighing . It was renumbered 22105 in August 1926 and worked the service until increasing bus competition killed off the station (although freight services lasted until 1964). 22105 moved to Hull and was withdrawn in 1934.The railways of York K HOOLE (Dalesman Books 1976) These two vehicles were predecessors of the many Diesel Multiple Units that proliferate on Britain's railways. The York to Scarborough line generally sees an hourly service operated by TransPennine Express services formed of Class 185 Diesel Multiple Unit trains. A number of steam specials use the line during the year. Reopening There has been talk of reopening a station at Haxby since the 1980s as the village has turned into a town of 9,000 people, and also reflecting road congestion in York including around York station. The reopening plan was approved by York City Council in 1997 and was part of the 2001 local transport plan. The plans continued to be shelved for a number of reasons, but Network Rail said in 2006 that it would provisionally support the reopening of this station. Funding for re-opening the station was announced in early 2009, with a target date for opening in January 2013, but the plans were put on hold in June 2010 until the amount of public money necessary for the works can be clarified. The possibility of re- opening Haxby station was revived by an announcement by City of York Council along with several of other transport related schemes in September 2012. The New Stations Study by West Yorkshire Metro in 2014 recommended further study of the site, and the City of York Council estimated that 22,000 people lived within of the proposed station.

Along with inhalation, ingestion and injection, dermal absorption is a route of exposure for toxic substances and route of administration for medication. Absorption of substances through the skin depends on a number of factors, the most important of which are concentration, duration of contact, solubility of medication, and physical condition of the skin and part of the body exposed. Skin (percutaneous, dermal) absorption is the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation. Skin absorption relates to the degree of exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin. Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally. Skin absorption can occur from occupational, environmental, or consumer skin exposure to chemicals, cosmetics, or pharmaceutical products. Some chemicals can be absorbed in enough quantity to cause detrimental systemic effects. Skin disease (dermatitis) is considered one of the most common occupational diseases.Workplace Safety & Health Topics: Skin Exposures & Effects. CDC. Retrieved April 17, 2014. In order to assess if a chemical can be a risk of either causing dermatitis or other more systemic effects and how that risk may be reduced one must know the extent to which it is absorbed, thus dermal exposure is a key aspect of human health risk assessment.  Factors influencing absorption  Along with inhalation, ingestion and injection, dermal absorption is a route of exposure for bioactive substances including medications.Eaton, DL and Klaassen Curtis D. Principles of Toxicology. in Cassarett & Doull's Toxicology, The Basic Science of Poisons. 5th edition. 1996. McGraw-Hill. Absorption of substances through the skin depends on a number of factors: * Concentration * Molecular Weight of the molecule * Duration of contact * Solubility of medication * Physical condition of the skin * Part of the body exposed including the amount of hair on the skin In general, the rate of absorption of chemicals through skin follows the following scheme from fastest to slowest: Scrotal > Forehead > Armpit ‚â• Scalp > Back = Abdomen > Palm = under surface of the foot.Baynes, RE and Hodgson E. Absorption and Distribution of Toxicants. in Chapter 6 of A Textbook of modern toxicology. 3rd edition. 2004, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  Structures influencing absorption  To be absorbed through the skin, a chemical must pass through the epidermis, glands, or hair follicles. Sweat glands and hair follicles make up about 0.1 to 1.0 percent of the total skin surface. Though small amounts of chemicals may enter the body rapidly through the glands or hair follicles, they are primarily absorbed through the epidermis. Chemicals must pass through the seven cell layers of epidermis before entering the dermis where they can enter the blood stream or lymph and circulate to other areas of the body. Toxins and toxicants can move through the layers by passive diffusion. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis and the rate-limiting barrier in absorption of an agent. Thus, how quickly something passes through this thicker outer layer determines the overall absorption. The stratum corneum is primarily composed of lipophilic cholesterol, cholesterol esters and ceramides. Thus lipid-soluble chemicals make it through the layer and into the circulation faster, however nearly all molecules penetrate it to some minimal degree.Morganti, P., Ruocco, E., Wolf, R., & Ruocco, V. (2001). \\"Percutaneous absorption and delivery systems.\\" Clin Dermatol. 19: 489-501. Absorption of chemicals in municipal water and dental products such as VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), TTHM (Total Trihalomethanes), fluoride and disinfectants is a major exposure to environmental health hazards. Diagram of skin structures.  Conditions affecting skin absorption  Agents that injure the stratum corneum, such as strong acids, are absorbed faster than chemicals that do not.Rozman, KK and Klaassen CD. Absorption, Distribution and Excretion of Toxicants. in Cassarett & Doull's Toxicology, The Basic Science of Poisons. 5th edition. 1996. McGraw-Hill Skin damage due to burns, abrasions, wounds and skin diseases also increase absorption. Thus populations with skin damage may be more susceptible to adverse effects of agents that are absorbed through the skin. Certain solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) act as carriers and are frequently used to transport medication through the skin. DMSO increases the permeability of the stratum corneum.Baggot JD. Disposition and Fate of Drugs in the Body. Chapter 5 in Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 6th edition, 1988 Iowa State Press, Ames.Booth NH, Topical Agents. Chap 44 in Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 6th edition, 1988 Iowa State Press, Ames. Surfactants like sodium lauryl-sulfate increase the skin penetration of water-soluble substances, possibly by increasing the skin permeability of water.  Medical use of skin absorption  Dermal application of a medication or chemical allows treatment to be localized, unlike ingestion or injection. Some medications seem to be more effective (or are more efficient) using the dermal route of administration. Some ingested drugs are heavily metabolized by the liver and may be inactivated, but using a dermal application bypasses this metabolic step allowing more parent compounds to enter the peripheral circulation. If a drug is absorbed well through the skin it may be used as a means of systemic medication. Dermal dosage forms include: liniments, braces, lotions, ointments, creams, dusting powders, aerosols, and transdermal patches.Davis, LE. Drug presentation and prescribing. Chap 3 in Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 6th edition, 1988 Iowa State Press, Ames. Specially designed patches are currently used to deliver fentanyl, nicotine and other compounds. Slower skin absorption versus oral or injectable may allow patches to provide medication for 1 to 7 days.Rice, RH and Cohen DE. Toxic Responses of the Skin. in Cassarett & Doull's Toxicology. The Basic Science of Poisons. 5th Edition. 1996. McGraw-Hill For instance nitroglycerin given transdermally may provide hours of protection against angina whereas the duration of effect sublingually may only be minutes.Shargel, L and Yu, A. Chapter 11. Modified-release drug products and drug delivery systems. in Applied Biopharmaceuts and Pharmacokinetics. 3rd edition. 1993 Appleton & Lange.  Measurement of skin absorption  The amount of chemical that is absorbed through the skin can be measured directly or indirectly. Studies have shown there are species with differences in the absorption of different chemicals. Measurements in rats, rabbits or pigs may or may not reflect human absorption. Finding the rate at which agents penetrate the skin is important for assessing the risk from exposures.  Direct measurement   In vivo  A chemical may be directly applied to the skin followed by blood and urine measurements, at set time points after the application, to assess the amount of chemical that entered the body. The concentration in the blood or urine at particular time points can be graphed to show an area under the curve and the extent and duration of absorption and distribution to provide a measure of systemic absorption. This can be done in animals or humans with a dry chemical powder or a chemical in solution. Rats are commonly used for these experiments. An area of skin is shaved before the chemical is applied. Often the area of chemical application is covered to prevent ingestion or rubbing off of the test material. Samples of blood and urine are taken at specific time intervals following application (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 24 hours) and in some protocols at the chosen end time the animal maybe necropsied. Tissue samples may also be evaluated for the presence of the test chemical.World Health Organization, Enivironmental Health Criteria 235, Dermal Absorption, 2006. In some test protocols many animals may be tested and necropsies may occur at set intervals after exposure. Biomonitoring, such as taking urine samples at intervals, from workers exposed to chemicals may provide some information but it is difficult to distinguish dermal from inhalation exposure using this method.  Ex vivo  The permeability properties of the stratum corneum are, for the most part, unchanged after its removal from the body. Skin that has been removed carefully from animals may also be used to see the extent of local penetration by putting it in a chamber and applying the chemical on one side and then measuring the amount of chemical that gets into a fluid on the other side. One example of this ex vivo technique is the isolated perfused porcine flap. This method was first described in 1986 as a humane alternative to in vivo animal testing.Riviere JE et al. The isolated perfused porcine skin flap (IPPSF). I. A novel in vitro model for percutaneous absorption and cutaneous toxicology studies. Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1986 Oct;7(3):444-53.  In vitro  Techniques such as static diffusion cells (Franz cells) and flow-through diffusion cells (Bronaugh cells) have also been used. The Franz Cell apparatus consists of two chambers separated by a membrane of animal or human skin. Human skin is preferred but due to ethical and other considerations is not always available. Human skin often may come from autopsies or plastic surgeries.Dressler WE (1999) Hair dye absorption. In: Bronaugh RL & Maibach HI eds. Percutaneous absorption: drugs‚Äìcosmetics‚Äìmechanisms‚Äìmethodology, 3rd ed. New York, Marcel Dekker, pp 685‚Äì716 (Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences Vol. 97). The test product is applied to the membrane via the top chamber. The bottom chamber contains fluid from which samples are taken at regular intervals for analysis to determine the amount of active cells that has permeated the membrane at set time points. Bronaugh cells are similar to Franz cells but use a flow-through system beneath the membrane layer and samples of the liquid below are taken continuously rather than at set time points. Bronaugh cells have been replaced with inline cells by some manufacturers.  Indirect measurement  It is sometimes impossible for humane reasons to apply a drug to the skin and measure its absorption. Sarin, a nerve gas, can be absorbed through intact skin and be lethal at low concentrations. Thus if one needs to assess the risk of Sarin exposure one must take skin absorption and other routes into account but one cannot ethically test Sarin on human subjects; thus ways of modeling the risk from skin exposure of the agent have been found. Models are used in some instances to predict the amount of exposure or absorption and to assess public health hazards. In order to assess the risk of a chemical causing a health issue one must assess the chemical and the exposure. Exposure modeling depends on several factors and assumptions. # The surface area of skin exposed. The surface area of an adult is about 20,900 cm2 and the surface area of a child of 6 years is about 9,000 cm2. These figures and figures for other body parts or portions can be found in the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Exposures Handbook 1996EPA Exposure Handbook 1996 or estimated using other databases.Yu, CY et al. Human body surface area database and estimation formula. Burns. 2010 Aug;36(5):616-29.. # The duration of exposure (in hours, minutes, etc.). # The concentration of the chemical. # The permeability coefficient of the chemical (how easy it is for the chemical to get through the skin). This may be estimated using an octanol-water partitioning coefficient (a measurement of the uptake from aqueous solution into powdered stratum corneum). # The weight of the person. Standard weight of an adult 71.8 kg, a 6-year-old child 22 kg and female of child-bearing age 60 kg are generally used. # The nature of the exposure. (Is it a cream applied to the whole body or just a small area? Or is it a bath in a dilute solution?)  Skin contact with dry chemical  :To calculate the dose of chemical a person is exposed to one must multiply the surface area of the skin exposed by the concentration of the chemical in the substance that comes into contact with the skin. Then multiply by the time in contact, by the permeability coefficients, and any unit conversion factors needed, then divide by the weight of the person. :A simple mathematical formula to estimate the dose for a single exposure is: :: concentration of chemical x surface area exposed x permeability coefficient / body weight. :Models for this can be found in the EPA Standard Operating Procedures for Residential Exposure Assessment.EPA 2012 Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for Residential Exposure Assessment These models establish guidelines for estimating pesticide exposure so that one can judge the risk and take appropriate actions if the risk is judged to be too great given the exposure.  Skin contact with chemical in solution (water, etc.)  :This can be modeled similarly to the dry chemical but one has to take into account the amount of solution the skin comes into contact with. Three scenarios for exposure to chemicals in a solution have been proposed and modeled. :a. A person could be exposed partially to a solution for a period of time. For instance if one stood in contaminated flood water for a period of time, or one worked in a situation where the hands and lower arms were immersed in a solution for a period of time. This type of scenario depends on the skin area exposed and the duration of the exposure as well as the concentration of the chemical in the solution. One may have to adjust the absorption coefficients for the different area of the body as the feet are more calloused on the bottom and will allow less chemical through than the lower leg. The rate of absorption of chemicals follows the following general scheme from fastest to slowest: Scrotal > Forehead > Armpit ‚â• Scalp > Back = Abdomen > Palm = under the surface of the foot. The dermal absorption of a dilute solution by partial leg or arm exposure has been modeled by Scharf. The EPA also has guidance on calculating the dermally absorbed doses of chemicals from contaminated water.US Enivironmental Protection Agency. Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund. Volume I: Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part E, Supplemental Guidance for Dermal Risk Assessment)-Final. Washington, DC: US EPA, Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation, EPA/540/R/99/005, OSWER 9285.7-02EP, July 2004. :Mathematical formula: ::Dermally absorbed dose rate = concentration in water x surface area exposed x exposure time x permeability coefficient x conversion factors. :b. The second scenario is total body immersion, such as swimming in a pool or lake. Exposure in swimming pools is only partially dermal and a SWIMODEL has been proposed.Dang, 1996 EPA SOP Estimating post application dermally absorbed dose from chemicals in Swimming pools This model takes into account not only the skin exposure but also considers ocular, ingestion, inhalation, and mucous membrane exposure that may occur due to being totally immersed. A second model dealing primarily with skin absorption was created by Scharf to assess the risk of overspray of pesticide from aerial spraying on swimming pools. These models use whole body surface area rather than the surface area of specific parts for the mathematical input. :c. The third scenario is splash, or droplet exposure. This model takes into account that not all water carrying a chemical that comes into contact with skin stays on the skin long enough to allow absorption. Only that portion of a chemical in the solution that stays in contact with the skin is available for absorption. This may be modeled using water adherence factors as postulated by Gujral 2011.  Skin contact with gas or aerosol  :This is a minor contributor and has been ignored in most risk assessments of chemicals as a route of exposure for gaseous or aerosolized toxicants. More research is needed in this area.  Controlling skin absorption  If skin exposure and absorption are deemed to indicate a risk, various methods to reduce absorption can be undertaken. * Labels of chemicals can be adapted to require the use of gloves or protective clothing. * Warnings to wash immediately if the chemical comes into contact with skin can be made. * Close pools or lakes to swimmers. * Limit the exposure time to chemicals, i.e. workers can only work with certain chemicals for a certain length of time per day.

She competed in the 800 m and 1500 m events at the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1500 m and 3000 m at the 1988 Summer Olympics; her best achievement was ninth place in the 3000 m in 1988. During her career she set one world record, on 4 March 1989 at the 1989 European Indoor Championships in Athletics in the 3000 m event (8:33.82), as well as three national records: in the mile (1986, 4:22.40), 1500 m (1987, 4:03.63) and 3000 m (1988, 8:33.97). In 1989 she was named Dutch Sportswoman of the Year. She started training in ballet, but had a limited success because of her height. At age 11 she started training in athletics, together with her elder brother. When she was in high school, she moved from Maastricht to Leeuwarden. There she started a long-term training program with her coach Theo Kersten. Although her trainer was 13 years older, they got involved into a romantic relationship and later got married. Elly van Hulst's career would last for almost twenty years and bring her 65 national, three European and two world titles. On the 3000 m indoor, she held the world record for twelve years. She participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. At the end of the 1980s Van Hulst showed that she was among the best athletes in the world. In 1988 she defeated Mary Decker, favorite for the 3000 m victory in Zurich. In 1990, Van Hulst began having strange physical complaints and was tired frequently. Doctors were unable to find anything that caused her symptoms, and so she kept on running. Eventually Van Hulst could not participate in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, because she was in the hospital for medical tests. It was discovered that she had a serious viral infection, and had had it for two years. As a result of the viral infection, she got exercise-induced asthma. However, because her asthma was easily controlled, her career was apparently unaffected. Just before the European Championships in 1994 in Paris, she heard that one of the ingredients of her medication was on the list of banned substances. A permitted alternative was not effective. As a result, she ended up in ninth place in Paris. Two years later, the ingredient in question was found to be harmless and was removed from the list of banned substances, but this change came too late for Van Hulst: she was not able to participate in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. During her successful years, Van Hulst trained in the Algarve in Portugal. She loved this place and later, when her career had ended, moved there. Nowadays she runs a real estate business, Elly van Hulst Real Estate Lda, together with her husband.Welcome to the Elly van Hulst Web Site, Algarve, Portugal. Property-runner.com.

Life Rohmer was born in Huttenheim, Alsace-Lorraine, part of the German Empire, to the farmer Albert Rohmer (1846‚Äì1912) and Marie-Elizabeth Metz (1850‚Äì1935). He became a physician after passing his thesis in Strasbourg in 1901. He worked some years in Cologne and Marburg inside Germany, and militated rapidly in order that pediatrics integrate medicine progress and social education of young mothers. During World War I, Rohmer was a German MD officer at the military hospital of Metz. Some of his famous Prussian colleagues asked him to sign the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three in 1914, but his pro-French feelings made him refuse to sign it. \\"Paul Rohmer une vie au service de l'enfance\\" by Florent Grange, 2005, 240 pages, Le Verger editeur, After the Allies victory in 1918, he became the first Professor of Pediatrics at the French Medicine College of Strasbourg, which became part of France again after the war. In 1920, Rohmer created the \\"Alsatian and Lorrainian Association of Nursery\\", the first one in France. The impacts of the work of this association were so huge that in 1945, more were created in France, on this model, the \\"National Mother and Childhood Protection\\" (also known as PMI ). Rohmer was a pioneer in research into prematurity, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, osteomalacia and vitamin C. He was the director of the pediatric clinic of Strasbourg until his retirement in 1947, and made it famous all around Europe. In 1946, he wrote with Robert Debr√© a famous manual entitled \\"Trait√© de Pathologie Infantile\\" (2,500 pages, two volumes) which became a reference for a whole generation of pediatricians. During his career, he was the physician of famous children, including those of the King of Belgium, of Konrad Adenauer, and of Pierre Pflimlin. Despite his retirement at age 70 in 1947, Rohmer continued until age 99 to participate actively to his research dealing with childhood and teenagers. He died in Strasbourg in 1977. A street in the city is now called \\"Pr Paul Rohmer\\" to honor him. Family In February 1904, Rohmer married Marie Louise Kieffer (1880‚Äì1962), with whom he had three children: Laurent (in 1904), Anne-Marie (in 1906), and Marie-Th√©r√®se (in 1908). The third child died a few weeks after her birth due to an unknown infection. This reinforced the single-mindedness of Rohmer to fight against the birth-death rate and prematurity. Rohmer has a family connection with Fran√ßois-Joseph Offenstein (1760‚Äì1837), a general during the Napoleonic Wars and the First French Empire.

He was the grandson of Pedro Jos√© Domingo de Guerra, President in 1879, a man of high integrity and chief justice of the Supreme Court, who had died in office after he was forced to assume presidential responsibilities during the disastrous War of the Pacific.  Biography   Early life and family  The scion of two illustrious aristocratic families from Chuquisaca, which traced descent from Incan royalty, the first Spanish conquistadors who came into Peru and eminent judges of the Audiencia of Charcas, on his mother's side, he was also related to Irish physician Francis Rynd and British statesman Lord Palmerston. He was sent to England at an early age to receive the best education possible. There, he studied under the Jesuits at Stonyhurst College, later at St Bede's College, and then at Merton College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1890, aged 21. He returned to Bolivia, where he worked in banking. An economist by training, he entered politics almost against his will. As one contemporary put it, \\"He never sought political preferment.\\" In 1914, he was elected to Congress as deputy from La Paz. His rise was meteoric, however, as he was tipped to succeed Ismael Montes as Liberal party candidate in the 1917 presidential elections.  Presidency  Having won at the polls, he took office but faced severe problems stemming from worsening economic conditions and mounting opposition from the recently formed Republican party. The 1917 assassination (never fully explained) of the founder of that party and former president, Jos√© Manuel Pando, further undermined Guti√©rrez-Guerra's popularity. Worse, he failed to act decisively from the point of view of his opponents, despite his call on Congress to launch an official investigation into the alleged excesses and misdeeds of his predecessor and political chief, Ismael Montes. Twenty-plus years of unbroken Liberal control of the government (the longest by one party in the history of Bolivia) had fatigued most Bolivians and turned them against the ruling elites and their methods, and earned the red-bearded, green-eyed head of state of this Andean nation, where the majority of people are Indian, the nickname \\"the last Oligarch.\\" All of this culminated in the 1920 coup d'√©tat which, with military help, brought to power the opposition Republican party under the leadership of Bautista Saavedra. Gutierrez-Guerra sought refuge in the United States legation at La Paz and went on to take a banking position at New York-based Chase National. He lived the rest of his days in exile, dying in Antofagasta, Chile in 1929.

He was the youngest son of the writer Petko Slaveykov. Biography Petko (right sculpture) as immortalized on Slaveykov Square in Sofia. Born in Tryavna during the Bulgarian National Revival under Ottoman rule, Pencho was educated there as well as in Stara Zagora and Plovdiv. After an accident in January 1884, when at the age of eighteen he fell asleep on a bench while it was snowing and thus he fell ill with pneumonia, and despite lengthy treatment in Plovdiv, Sofia, Leipzig, Berlin and Paris, this illness left him with serious impairments ‚Äì he could not walk without a cane, and he wrote and spoke with difficulties. He suffered from melancholic episodes, which forced him to find a cure in literature and to harden his will. Slaveykov's works include poems and intimate lyrics. He collaborated with a number of magazines, which issued his works, and spent a part of his life in Leipzig studying philosophy, where he became familiar with German literature, thought and art. After returning to Bulgaria in 1898, Slaveykov joined the Misal circle with a number of other noted writers, such as Krastyo Krastev, Petko Todorov, Dimcho Debelyanov and Peyo Yavorov. He became an assistant director (1901‚Äì1909) and later director of the National Library of Bulgaria (1909‚Äì1911) and a director of the Bulgarian National Theatre (1908‚Äì1909). In 1903 he began a relationship with poet Mara Belcheva which lasted until his death in 1912. They never married but referred to her as his \\"wife\\" throughout his writings. He was sent on missions to Moscow (1909) and Istanbul, Athens, Naples, Sorrento, and Rome (1911), where he studied the development of the libraries. Upon returning he engaged in hectic work. He was fired from the post of director of the National Library because of political misunderstandings with the minister of culture Stefan Bobchev on 10 July 1911, and left Bulgaria, living in Z√ºrich, Lucerne, G√∂schenen, Andermatt, Lugano and other places in Switzerland before arriving in Italy in the end of November 1911. He remained in Rome for three months, but set off in May 1912 to travel through Florence, the Engadin and the mountains looking for a cure. In the end of the month he arrived in the small town of Brunate near Lake Como, where he died on 10 June 1912. Slaveykov was buried in Brunate's cemetery and his remains were moved to Bulgaria in 1921. Due to his death, the suggestion by Swedish professor Al.

While legend says that Amir Khusro was the author, the tales were written long after his death. Legend has it that Amir Khusro's master and Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya had fallen ill. To cheer him up, Amir Khusro started telling him a series of stories in the style of the One Thousand and One Nights. Style The book is in some ways similar to the Thousand and One Nights in its method of framing and linking unfinished stories within each other. The central character is a king, Azad Bakht, who falls into depression after thinking about his own mortality, and so sets out from his palace seeking wise men. He comes upon four dervishes in a cemetery, and listens to their fantastical stories. Each Dervish narrates his own story, which is basically on love and fidelity in their own past lives. When the fourth dervish finishes his tale, the king Azadbakht suddenly learns that one of his wives has just born the son to him. Overwhelmed with joy, the king orders to arrange a great feast. With the help of the great king of jinns, Malik Syahpal, Azadbakht marries all the separated lovers to one another: the merchant's son from Yemen to the princess of Damsyik, the prince of Fars to the princess of Basra, the prince of Ajam to the princess of Farang, the prince of Nimroz to the princess of jinns, and the prince of China to the daughter of the courtier, who was kidnapped by Malik Sadik. Everyone happily achieves the fulfillment of his or her desire. Translations These stories were originally written in Persian by Amir Khusro as Qissa-ye ChahƒÅr Darvƒìsh. It was initially translated by Mir Husain Ata Tehseen into Urdu as Nav Tarz-e-Murassaa (, \\"New Ornate Style\\") but the language was a highly literate one and was not understood by general public to enjoy. In 1801, College of Fort William in Calcutta started a project translating Indian literature. Mr. John Borthwick Gilchrist, a famous scholar of literature, asked Mir Amman, an employee of the college, to translate it into the Urdu language. Mir Amman translated it from Persian into everyday Urdu, under the title BƒÅgh o BahƒÅr. Later, in 1857, Duncan Forbes retranslated it into English. The translation of Mir Amman is still enjoyed as a classical work of Urdu Literature for the common daily language of its time.

However, after a disagreement with Daniel Elfrith (possibly over the capture of Spanish and Portuguese slavers during the early 1630s ), he soon left the island with Abraham Blauvelt and Sussex Camock and sailed for Honduras in 1633. In 1635, he accepted Dutch letters of marque despite being in the employ of the Providence Island Company and, from 1636 to 1641, acted as a privateer for the English trading company. Although briefly returning to Providence to assist the island's defense against Spanish attacks in 1636, Axe had a successful privateering career delivering a captured prize, with a cargo including gold, silver, jewels, indigo and cochineal, as he returned to England in May 1640. Following the capture of Providence by Spain in 1641, the Providence Island Company was dissolved. Escaping to St. Kitts, Axe would later take part in a privateering expedition under Captain William Jackson to the West Indies from 1642 to 1645, in which the privateers managed to capture Jamaica.

The castle is situated on the top of Halton Hill, a sandstone prominence overlooking the village. A motte and bailey castle was built with construction starting in 1071, the original building was replaced with the current sandstone castle in the 13th Century. Building alterations continued until at least 1609 when the structure is recorded as in disrepair. The castle is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and a scheduled ancient monument. It was the seat of the Barons of Halton from the 11th century until the 14th century and it then passed to the Duchy of Lancaster. It was besieged twice in the Civil War after which its structure deteriorated. In the 18th century a new courthouse was built on the site of the previous gatehouse. The castle lies in ruins apart from the courthouse which has been converted into a public house. History Buck brothers Early history There is evidence that Halton Hill was a settlement in prehistoric times. Construction of the castle began in 1071 after Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester gave the land to Nigel of Cotentin, who built a wooden motte and bailey castle. This was replaced by a sandstone castle in the 13th century, which still stands. When the 15th baron, Henry Bolingbroke, became King Henry IV, the castle became the property of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1207 King John visited and donated ¬£5 towards the upkeep of its chapel.. Edward II visited the castle for three days in November 1323, during which time he also visited Norton Priory. A new gate tower was built between 1450-57. During the Tudor period it was primarily used as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580‚Äì81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants. According to a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609, the castle had fallen into disrepair by then. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War the castle was garrisoned by the Royalists under the command of Captain Walter Primrose who had been appointed by Earl Rivers. It was besieged by Roundhead Parliamentary forces under Sir William Brereton in 1643, and after several weeks' fighting, the Royalists surrendered. They regained control under Colonel Fenwick after the Parliamentarians abandoned the castle to focus on Royalist forces led by Prince Rupert. There was a second siege in 1644 but, as the fortunes of the Royalists declined elsewhere, they withdrew from Halton and the Parliamentarians under Sir William Brereton re-occupied the castle. In 1646 a \\"Council of War\\" was held in Warrington where it was decided that the defences of the castles at Halton and Beeston should be dismantled. Halton Castle served no military function after this time. By 1650 the castle was said to be \\"very ruinous\\". Later history The condition of the building continued to deteriorate although the gatehouse remained in use as a court. In 1728 George Cholmondeley, 2nd Earl of Cholmondeley leased the site from the Crown. In 1737 a courthouse was built on the site of the medieval gatehouse. Henry Sephton, a Liverpool architect and builder and John Orme, a joiner from Prescot, were appointed to carry out the work. The first floor was the courtroom and prisoners were held in the basement. By 1792 the courthouse had fallen into disrepair and money was found to repair it, although the source of that money is unclear. The court continued to function there until 1908. Around 1800 three folly walls had been added to the existing ruined walls on the east side of the castle to make it look more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of Sir Richard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986‚Äì87 the site of the castle was excavated. Present state Former courthouse of the castle, now the Castle Hotel The castle continues to be owned by the Duchy of Lancaster and the site is managed by the Norton Priory Museum Trust. The interior of the castle is occasionally opened to the public and there are plans to make it more accessible in the future. The castle is a Grade I listed building. Its walls are in a ruinous state but the circumference is intact and it is possible to walk completely around the exterior. From its prominent position there are extensive views in all directions, including Lancashire, Cheshire, the Pennines, the hills of the Peak District and the mountains of North Wales. The courthouse is now a public house, the Castle Hotel. Its first floor is used as a function room and the basement contains the cellars of the public house. It is designated as a Grade II* listed building.

See Guterbock (1951). The \\"song of Ullikummi\\" was recognized from its first rediscovery as a predecessor of Greek myths in Hesiod.

Upelluri, absorbed in his meditations, did not feel Ullikummi on his shoulder.Upelluri stands in the netherworld, holding the earth and sky on his shoulder like the Greek Atlas; a mere giant such as Ullikummi is barely noticeable, although Upelluri does feel a bit of pain in his shoulder once Ullikummi has grown up. Ullikummi grew quickly until he reached the heavens. Ullikummi's brother Teshub thundered and rained on Ullikummi, but it did not harm him. Teshub fled and abdicated the throne.The weather god and his vizier and brother, Tasmisu, are defeated in their first battle with Ullikummi, as Tasmisu relates to Teshub's wife, Hebat; as a result Teshub is banished to a \\"little place,\\" probably meaning a grave.

The entire road falls within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area and is wholly managed by VicRoads. It is a single carriageway for its entire length, being completely sealed since 1941, with one lane in each direction and occasional overtaking lanes being provided. Speed limits range from 50‚Äì60 km/h through townships and 70‚Äì80 km/h elsewhere, with the exception of a 90 km/h zone between Seville and Woori Yallock. Because of the lack of the standard 100 km/h rural speed limit and high traffic volumes, Victoria Police maintain a high level of patrol and vigilance. The highway continues east of Warburton as Woods Point Road (C511) With the introduction of traffic lights in Seville, as well as the reduction of speed limits and addition of a greater number of speed zones, the Warburton Highway is becoming over congested during peak times. Evidence of this can be seen during any weekday afternoon. Outbound traffic approaching a pedestrian crossing in Seville often queues up to 1.1 km. Motor vehicle accidents are predominant in and around the Alsopps Road intersection in Launching Place due to fuel residue from a nearby petrol station.

The route from the summit to Redstone Creek, which could be used by wagons, was bypassed by Braddock. At the summit near the top of the watershed of the Youghigheny, Braddock's Expedition diverted from the Nemacolin Trail for an overland approach on Ft. Dusquesne that would not require crossing the Allegheny, Youghigheny, or Monongahela rivers. His route was not usable by wagons and still is not today. Nemacolin's Trail, or less often Nemacolin's Path, was an ancient Native American trail that crossed the great barrier of the Allegheny Mountains via the Cumberland Narrows Mountain pass, connecting the watersheds of the Potomac River and the Monongahela River in the present- day United States of America. Nemacolin's Trail connected what are now Cumberland, Maryland and Brownsville, Pennsylvania. The path was a network of trails that had long been used by indigenous peoples in pre-colonial America. Nemacolin's Path starts near present-day Cumberland, Maryland, continuing on to Brownsville, Pennsylvania to the neighborhood known today as Redstone located at mouth of Redstone Creek. In colonial America, the site was known as Redstone Old Fort for its defensive installation. During 1749 and 1750, the Delaware Indian chief Nemacolin and Maryland frontiersman Thomas Cresap supervised improving the trail for the Ohio Company, at the behest of Christopher Gist. They developed the template trail and in large part the route for what became known on the eastern slopes as the eastern part of Braddock's Road. In 1755 during the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the English and French), English General Edward Braddock used the eastern part of Nemacolin's Path as a military route in his attempt to capture Fort Duquesne, held by the French. (It was later developed as Pittsburgh.) Crossing the Allegheny divide was a major task well into the 19th century, requiring much planning, time and effort. East-west highways were not built across the border between Virginia and West Virginia until late in the century. The two regions were separated by some of the harshest terrain in the mountain chain. Except for using the Cumberland Narrows, travelers would have to go hundreds of miles to the north or south to get through the mountains, as the ridgelines are oriented north-south and are nearly impassable. Nemacolin's Trail was later improved as the Cumberland Road, the National Road, the National Pike, and eventually U.S. Route 40, or the National Highway. U.S. Route 40 became one of the first officially recognized highways in the United States. The earlier road, known as the Cumberland Road/National Road, ran on the first cast iron bridge constructed in the United States, at Dunlap's Creek. Nemacolin's Trail became the gateway by which settlers in Conestoga wagons or stage coaches reached the lands west of the Appalachian mountains.

It is owned by Beam Suntory. A small pot still distillery, the licence to distil dates to 1757, a copy of which can be seen in the distillery. Similar to many Irish distilleries, Kilbeggan endured financial difficulties during the early 20th century, and ceased operations in 1957. However, the licence was maintained and the distillery was later refurbished, with distilling recommencing on-site in 2007. Noted devotees of the distillery's whiskeys include British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, and Myles na gCopaleen, the Irish playwright. History  Early years  The distillery was founded in 1757 by Matthew MacManus, who may have distilled elsewhere before founding Kilbeggan.\\"Kilbeggan Distillery re-activated after 53 years\\", Athlone Advertiser, 23 March 2007 Although information about the early years of the distillery is scarce, documentation suggests that in its early years the distillery operated with a 232 gallon still, and an annual output of 1,500 gallons. By the early 19th century, the distillery was being run by a John and William Codd. In 1841, the distillery was put up for sale following the dissolution of the partnership between its then owners, William Codd and William Cuffee. The distillery at the time consisted of a brew house, still house with three pot stills (wash still: 8,000 gallons; low wine still, no. 1; 2,000 gallons; low wine still, no. 2: 1,500 gallons), run-room with five receivers, malt house, corn stores capable of storing 5,000 barrels, and oat-meal mills. Also listed in the sale were 400 tonnes of coal, and 10,000 boxes of turf - the latter reflecting the immense quantities of turf consumed at the distillery, so much so, that it was reported to have kept hundreds of poor people profitably employed in cutting, rearing, and drawing it to the town throughout the year.  Locke's Distillery  In 1843, the distillery was taken over by John Locke, under whose stewardship the distillery flourished. Locke treated his staff well, and was held in high regard by both his workers and the people of the town. Informal records show that under Locke the distillery provided cottages for its employees, either for rent or purchase through a form of in-house mortgage scheme. In addition, all staff received a wagon load of coal at the start of each winter, the cost of which was deducted from salaries retrospectively on a weekly basis. Testimony of the respect with which he was held is offered by an incident in 1866. Following an accident on-site which had rendered a critical piece of equipment, the steam boiler, inoperable, the distillery had come to a standstill. With Locke unable to afford or obtain a loan to fund a replacement, the future of distillery lay in doubt. However, in a gesture of solidarity, the people of Kilbeggan came together and purchased a replacement boiler, which they presented to John Locke, along with the following public letter of appreciation, which was printed in several local newspapers at the time: > An Address from the People of Kilbeggan to John Locke, Esq. Dear Sir - > Permit us, your fellow townsmen, to assure of our deep and cordial sympathy > in your loss and disappointment from the accident which occurred recently in > your Distillery. Sincerely as we regret the accident, happily unattended > with loss of life, we cannot but rejoice at the long-wished-for opportunity > it affords us of testifying to you the high appreciation in which we hold > you for your public and private worth. We are well aware that the > restrictions imposed by recent legislation on that particular branch of > Irish industry, with which you have been so long identified, have been > attended with disastrous results to the trade, as is manifest in the long > list of Distilleries now almost in ruins, and which were a few years ago > centres of busy industry, affording remunerative employment to thousands of > hands; and we are convinced the Kilbeggan Distillery would have long since > swelled the dismal catalogue had it fallen into less energetic and > enterprising hands. In such an event we would be compelled to witness the > disheartening scene of a large number of our working population without > employment during that period of the year when employment Is scarcest, and > at the same time most essential to the poor. Independent then of what we owe > you, on purely personal grounds, we feel we owe you a deep debt of gratitude > for maintaining in our midst a manufacture which affords such extensive > employment to our poor, and exercises so favourable an influence on the > prosperity of the town. In conclusion, dear Sir, we beg your acceptance of a > new steam boiler to replace the injured one, as testimony, inadequate though > it is, of our unfeigned respect and esteems for you ; and we beg to present > it with the ardent wish and earnest hope that, for many long years to come, > it may contribute to enhance still more the deservedly high and increasing > reputation of the Kilbeggan Distillery. In a public response to mark the gift, also published in several newspapers, Locke thanked the people of Kilbeggan for their generosity, stating \\"...I feel this to be the proudest day of my life...\\". A plaque commemorating the event hangs in the distillery's restaurant today. In 1878, a fire broke out in the \\"can dip\\" (sampling) room of the distillery, and spread rapidly. Although, the fire was extinguished within an hour, it destroying a considerable portion of the front of the distillery and caused ¬£400 worth of damage. Hundreds of gallons of new whiskey were also consumed in the blaze - however, the distillery is said to have been saved from further physical and financial ruin through the quick reaction of townsfolk who broke down the doors of the warehouses, and helped roll thousands of casks of ageing spirit down the street to safety. In 1887, the distillery was visited by Alfred Barnard, a British writer, as research for his book, \\"the Whiskey Distilleries of the United Kingdom\\". By then, the much enlarged distillery was being managed by John's sons, John Edward and James Harvey, who told Barnard that the distillery's output had more than doubled during the preceding ten years, and that they intended to install electric lighting. Barnard noted that the distillery, which he referred to as the \\"Brusna Distillery\\", named for the nearby river, was said to be the oldest in Ireland. According to Barnard, the distillery covered 5 acres, and employed a staff of about 70 men, with the aged and sick pensioned-off or assisted. At the time of his visit, the distillery was producing 157,200 proof gallons per annum, though it had the capacity to produce 200,000. The whiskey, which was sold primarily in Dublin, England, and \\"the Colonies\\", was \\"old pot still\\", produced using four pot stills (two wash stills: 10,320 / 8,436 gallons; and two spirit stills: 6,170 / 6,080 gallons), which had been installed by Millar and Company, Dublin. Barnard remarked that at the time of his visit over 2,000 casks of spirit were ageing in the distillery's bonded warehouses. In 1893, the distillery ceased to be privately held, and was converted a limited stock company, trading as John Locke & Co., Ltd., with nominal capital of ¬£40,000.  Decline and Closure  In the early part of the 20th century, Kilbeggan, like many Irish whiskey distilleries at the time, entered a period of decline. This was due to the combined effects of loss and hampering of market access - due to prohibition in the United States, the trade war with the British Empire, shipping difficulties during the world wars, and Irish Government export quotas; as well as competition from blended Scotch, and disruption to production during the Irish war of Independence. As a result, Kilbeggan was forced to cease production of new spirit for 7 years between 1924 and 1931, decimating the company's cash flow and finances. Most of the staff at the distillery were let go, and the distillery slowly sold off its stocks of aged whiskey. Also in the 1920s, both of John sons passed away, John in 1920, and James in 1927, and ownership of the distillery passed to Locke's granddaughters, Mary Evelyn and Florence Emily. However, by then the distillery was in need to repair, with the turbulent economic conditions of the early 20th century having meant that no investment had been made in new plant since the 1890s. Distilling resumed in 1931, following the end of prohibition in the United States, and for a time the distillery's finances improved - with a loss of ¬£83 in 1931, converted to a modest profit of ¬£6,700 in 1939. In 1947, the Lockes decided to put the distillery was put up for sale as a going concern. Although run down, the distillery had valuable stocks of mature whiskey, a valuable commodity in post-war Europe. An offer of ¬£305,000 was received from a Swiss investor fronted by an Englishman, going by the name of Horace Smith. Their unstated interest, was not the business itself, but the 60,000 gallons of whiskey stocks, which they hoped to sell on the black market in England at ¬£11 a gallon - thus, more than doubling their investment overnight. However, when they failed to come up with the deposit, the duo were arrested and promptly interrogated by Irish police. The Englishman, it turned out, was an impostor named Maximoe, who was wanted by Scotland Yard. The Irish authorities placed Maximoe on a ferry back to England for extradition, but he jumped overboard and escaped with the help of unknown accomplices. An Irish opposition politician, Oliver J. Flanagan, subsequently alleged under parliamentary privilege that members of the governing Fianna F√°il political party were linked to the deal, accusing then Irish Taoiseach √âamon de Valera and his son of having accepted gold watches from the Swiss businessman. A tribunal of inquiry discounted the allegations but the damage contributed to Fianna F√°il's defeat in the 1948 election. In addition, as the scandal remained headline news in Ireland for several months, it discouraged interest from other investors in the distillery. Thus with no buyer found, operations continued at the distillery, with production averaging between 120,000 - 150,000 proof gallons per annum, and consumption running at between 15,000 - 20,000 barrels of barrel. In addition, although heavily indebted, investments were made in new plant and equipment. However, the death knell for the distillery came in April 1952, when the Irish Government introduced a 28% hike in the excise duties on spirits, causing a drastic decline in domestic whiskey sales. By November 1953, the distillery could not afford to pay the duty to release whiskey ordered for Christmas from bond, and production was forced to come to a halt. Although distilling had stopped, the firm struggled on until 27 November 1958, when a debenture issued in 1953 fell due, which the distillery could not afford to pay, forcing the bank to call in the receivers. Thus, bringing to an end 201 years of distilling in the town. In 1962, the distillery was purchased for ¬£10,000 by Karl Heinz Moller, a German businessman, who owned a motor distribution company in Hamburg. Moller made a substantial profit on the deal, by selling off the whiskey stocks (about 100,000 gallons - worth tens of thousands of pounds alone) and a rare Mercedes Benz owned by the distillery. Much to the dismay of locals, Moller proceeded to convert the distillery into a pigsty, smashing thousands of Locke earthenware crocks (which would be worth a substantial amount at auction today) to create a hard-core base for the concrete floor. In 1969, the distillery was sold to Powerscreen, a firm which sold Volvo loading shovels, and in the early 1970s, the stills and worms were removed and sold for scrap.  Distillery reopens  In 1982, almost thirty years after the distillery ceased operations, the Kilbeggan Preservation and Development Association was formed by locals in the town. Using funds raised locally, the Association restored the Distillery, and reopened it to the public as a whiskey distillery museum. Then, in 1987, the newly opened Cooley Distillery acquired the assets of Kilbeggan distillery, allowing Cooley to relaunch whiskeys under the Kilbeggan and Locke's Whiskey brands. Cooley later also took over the running of the museum, and began the process of re-establishing a working distillery on-site. Cooley were aided in the process by the fact that since the distillery's closure, each subsequent owner had faithfully paid the ¬£5 annual fee to maintain the distilling licence. In 2007, the 250th anniversary of the distillery's founding, distillation recommenced at Kilbeggan. The official firing of the pot stills was witnessed by direct descendants of the three families, the McManuses, the Codds, and the Lockes, who had run the distillery during its 200 year distilling history. In a nod to the long history of distilling at Kilbeggan, one of the two pot stills installed in the refurbished distillery was a 180-year old pot still, which had originally been installed at the Old Tullamore Distillery in the early 1800s. It is the oldest working pot still producing whiskey in the world today. In 2010, with the installation of a mash tun and fermentation vats, Kilbeggan became a fully operational distillery once again. Present day Bottle of \\"Kilbeggan Finest Irish whiskey\\" Today the distillery is known as Kilbeggan Distillery, and includes a restaurant, The Pantry Restaurant, and a 19th-century waterwheel that has been restored to working condition. The distillery can also be powered by a steam engine, which is in working condition but rarely used. It was installed to allow the distillery to continue operating in times of low water on the river. Prior to the recommencement of operations of Kilbeggan, the three brands associated with the distillery‚ÄîKilbeggan, Locke's Blend and Locke's Malt were produced at the Cooley Distillery in County Louth, before being transported to Kilbeggan, where they were to stored in a 200 year old granite warehouse.Cooley Irish Whiskey - Products However, following recommencement of operations at Kilbeggan, new whiskey produced on-site has been sufficiently mature for market since around 2014. Since reopening, the distillery has launched a Kilbeggan Small Batch Rye, the first whiskey to be 100% distilled and matured on-site since the restoration was completed. Double-distilled, the whiskey is produced from a mash of malt, barley, and about 30% rye, said to reflect the traditional practice of using rye, which was common at 19th century Irish distilleries, but has since virtually died out. In late 2009, the distillery released small '3-pack' samples of its still-developing \\"new make spirit\\" at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years of age (in Ireland, the spirit must be aged a minimum of three years before it can legally be called \\"whiskey\\"). The distillery's visitor centre was among the nominations in Whisky Magazine's Icons of Whisky visitor attraction category in 2008.

The line from Valleyfield to Beauharnois was originally a branch of the Grand Trunk Railway, built in the 1880s. The StL&A; leased this line and in 1897 opened an extension from Beauharnois to Adirondack Junction. The line passed to the New York Central Railroad and Conrail through leases, mergers, and takeovers. Conrail bought the line from Massena to Huntingdon from the Canadian National Railway in 1993. The line between Beauharnois and Kahnawake was placed out of service, but not abandoned, in the late 1990s. In the 1999 breakup of Conrail, the Montreal Subdivision was sold to CSX Transportation. On August 19, 2019, with an agreement between CSX Transportation and Canadian National established, the St. Lawrence Subdivision along with the Montreal & Fulton Subdivision, were all sold off to CN.

Early years Tilley was born in Bowmanville, Ontario and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1929. He opened a private practice in Toronto at the Toronto Western and Wellesley hospitals in 1935, and was one of the first physicians in Canada to train in plastic surgery. Second World War A member of the Canadian Army Medical Corps Militia, he was transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Medical Branch at the start of the Second World War and became the Principal Medical Officer in 1941. In 1942, he worked at the Queen Victoria Hospital with Archibald McIndoe where burned airmen were treated. The patients called themselves the Guinea Pig Club. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 and was discharged from the RCAF with the rank of Group Captain in 1945. Post-war years After the war, he returned to his practice in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, where he was an assistant professor of surgery. Dr. Tilley was the first to teach plastic surgery at Queen's University. He was a charter member and a past president of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons. In 1981, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1982, he was made an honorary member of the Canadian Medical Association.

Biography Born in L≈ëcse, Hungary (now part of Slovakia) in 1893, Raisz was the son of a civil engineer, who introduced him to maps through his work. The son received his degree in civil engineering and architecture from the Royal Polytechnicum in Budapest in 1914, and after serving in the army during World War I, he immigrated to New York in 1923. He worked for the Ohman Map Company while studying for his 1929 Ph.D. at Columbia University. He offered a course in cartography while a student, one of the first such in the United States. In 1931 he joined the Institute of Geographical Exploration at Harvard University, where he taught cartography and was curator of the map collection for 20 years. He created a significant body of work using hand-drawn pen-and-ink techniques, which during that period were largely being replaced by photo-mechanical processes and scribing. Because they were hand-drawn, his maps and graphics have a distinctive look to them, unique to his hand. He was author of the first cartography textbook in English, General cartography (1938). Raisz is best known for his physiographic maps, which describe landforms using his \\"orthoapsidal\\" or \\"armadillo\\" projection (essentially a small-scale variation on an isometric projection). Created for continents, nations and states, they form a solid corpus of work whose use continues today. Raisz Landform Maps, operated by his family, continues to publish much of his work.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town at the foot of Mount Macedon in the Macedon Ranges, between Melbourne and Bendigo in central Victoria. It is administered by the Shire of Macedon Ranges . At the Macedon had a population of 2,808. The combined population of Macedon and the nearby larger town of Gisborne was 21,071 Estimated resident population, 30 June 2016. at June 2016. Etymology Macedon's name derives from the Ancient Kingdom of Macedon. The toponym Macedon is derived itself from the ancient Greek adjective ŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒΩœåœÇ (makedn√≥s), meaning \\"tall\\", possibly descriptive of the inhabitants of Macedon.Liddell and Scott 1940. It has the same root as the adjective ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅœåœÇ (makros), meaning \\"long\\" or \\"tall\\" in Ancient Greek. The name is originally believed to have meant either \\"highlanders\\", \\"the tall ones\\", or \\"high grown men\\".; ; Eugene N. Borza writes that the \\"highlanders\\" or \\"Makedones\\" of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia are derived from northwest Greek stock; they were akin both to those who at an earlier time may have migrated south to become the historical \\"Dorians\\". History The original inhabitants of Macedon are the Kulin nation - specifically, the Wurundjeri, Dja Dja Wurrrung and Taungurung people, who have lived there continually for at least 26,000 years. Their communities are still active today. Europeans arrived in 1837, and early interactions between Kulin Aboriginal people and European settlers were strained, with reports of thefts of stock; however there were no massacres of Aboriginal people reported in the district in the authoritative study. In the 1850s, gold was discovered in the Victorian Goldfields. Middle Gully, as Macedon was called back then, became a hub of activity and provided inns, beer houses, coffee tents, blacksmiths‚Äô forges and stores for the crowds of gold miners. The gold rush of the 1850s-1870s ensured that the area continued to flourish, and the construction of the railway between Melbourne and Bendigo from 1858 to 1862 brought many new residents to the region. The town was affected by the land boom of the late 1880s, with investors being brought up by specially arranged trains. At the peak, property prices increased by up to 3 or 4 times in a short time. By 1893, the settlement had taken on the name Macedon and was growing through a co-operative association model with shared labour clearing land and building dwellings and fencing. Local industry sprung up, including a butter factory, said by a Melbourne newspaper at the time as \\"situated about one mile from the station, on the road to the mount. The building is in brick, 25 x 46ft. The separator is 100gal. capacity, and can revolve 7,000 times per minute. It contains all the latest improvements in butter-making machinery. The whole plant is worked by a six-horse water-wheel, supplied by pipes from a private reservoir.\\" Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, Melbourne's wealthy social elite began to settle the area in earnest due to large blocks of land on the south side of Mount Macedon being released to them by the government. In 1903 the Australian handbook described Macedon as \\"a post, money-order, savings bank and telegraph town. It is situated on the Melbourne and Echuca railway, 43¬º rail miles NNW of the former. There are three hotels, Moody's Family, Victorian Alps and State Nursery Hotel, two general stores, a State school (No. 1,660), Anglican, Wesleyan and Roman Catholic churches, Jubilee hall, library and a State nursery in the neighbourhood, also several eucalyptus oil works.\\"  1918 Avenue of Honour  The village of Macedon is home to a heritage listed war memorial Avenue of Honour, an extensive planting of 224 oak trees on both sides of the avenue for approximately one kilometre in length between the cemetery at Bent Street and Mt Macedon Road. The trees, comprising Pin Oaks, English oaks, Algerian oaks and oak hybrids were planted by members of the local community working each Saturday for three months in 1918, with each tree planted representing the life of an enlisted soldier from the local area. The opening ceremony for the Avenue was held on 10 August 1918 with \\"the State Premier (Mr. Lawson) and the Federal and State members for the district are expected to be present, and a strong band is to be in attendance\\". The Premier said that this Avenue \\"would serve to remind the future generations of their obligations to the men, and women too, who were now doing so much for mankind, and, furthermore, would stand as an example of great public service\\" and that the community \\"will regard it as a sacred duty to look after this avenue, care for the trees, and remember the grand purpose underlying the whole movement\\". The autumn colours of the Avenue of Honour attract a large influx of visitors annually, prompting the local council to introduce temporary traffic and parking restrictions in recent years.  1983 Ash Wednesday Bushfires  Macedon was one of the towns extensively damaged by the Ash Wednesday bushfires on 16 February 1983, with 2 deaths in the town and 64 houses destroyed. Most of the shops, the Catholic Church (circa 1891) and Anglican church (circa 1931) were burnt, along with the Jubilee hall, the fire station, the school and the Water Board's office. The Victorian newspaper The Age reported the next day that \\"A fire officer came out of Macedon at 3am and said: 'I saw one house and one pub standing.'\\" Australian Defence Force members were deployed to assist the town in the aftermath after the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services requested help from the Federal Government. A public park near the centre of Macedon, located across the road from Macedon's railway station, now serves as a memorial to the losses of Ash Wednesday. Today In recent years, Macedon's popularity has increased: proximity to Melbourne, boutique bed and breakfast accommodation, food and wine industries and arts scene have made the region highly sought after, drawing tourists and new residents, making the local population growth rate among the fastest in regional Victoria. Locals, worried about the environmental and cultural impacts of this growing popularity, successfully campaigned for new planning controls to protect the character of the region. A number of media reports have made reference to the influx of young professionals, artists and 'hipsters' to the region, drawn by the region's natural environment, proximity to the city and access to city-style cafes and restaurants.  Attractions   Vineyards  There are several commercial vineyards open to the public in the area immediately surrounding Macedon, including North Wine and Mount Macedon Winery, which at one time was owned by entertainer Olivia Newton John.  Private Zoo  Wild Action Zoo, a licensed private zoological facility on 11 acres of land is located in Macedon and provides education about animals via prearranged visits or via a mobile zoo around the State of Victoria. The zoo's owner, Chris Humfrey starred in a TV series \\"Chris Humfrey's Animal Instinct\\" which ran on the Australian version of Animal Planet, a Pay-TV channel.  Economy  The initial economy of the town was based on timber and servicing the gold rush further inland from Melbourne. Later a number of eucalyptus distilleries opened up in the town due to a considerable demand for eucalyptus for medicinal purposes. The first was opened in 1894 which was \\"a eucalyptus oil distillery, which is to be erected in Mrs Pinchoffs paddock by Mr Moody, of the Macedon Hotel\\". The \\"Wombat Brand\\" eucalyptus oil was manufactured at the Macedon Eucalyptus Oil Distillery in the late 1800s. As of the 2016 census, the main industries employing people in the Macedon area is Education & Training (13.1%), Healthcare and Social Assistance (10.5%), Construction (10%), Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (9.4%), Public Administration and Safety (7.3%), Retail (6.4%) and Manufacturing (6%).  Transport  The railway line from Melbourne was constructed in 1861, one year after the township was surveyed, near a once-permanent creek. The township was first named Middle Gully, however within a few years of the opening of the railway, Middle Gully's name was changed to Macedon. The railway line's route includes heritage listed Middle Gully rail bridge, completed in 1862 just to the west of Macedon which is an example of one of the earliest metal plate girder road bridges in Victoria. The railway at Macedon later transported horticultural produce & timber to Melbourne and was the stopping-off point for visitors to resort facilities on Mount Macedon. Macedon railway station is located on the V/Line Bendigo line. In 1970 the Tullamarine Freeway was opened, putting Macedon within easier commuting distance of outer metropolitan Melbourne.  Education   Primary  Macedon Primary School is a State public school that was established in 1869. The school maintains a current enrolment of 242 students as at 2019.  Secondary   Macedon Grammar School  Macedon Grammar was a secondary school that operated from 1979 to 2014. In November 2014, Macedon Grammar school went into administration and the Victorian government announced in December 2014 that the school would close.  Alice Miller School  After Macedon Grammar school was closed in 2014 the site was purchased the following year by children's author John Mardsen who opened the Alice Miller School, a secondary school for 200 pupils focused on the arts. It is based on the same principles as his Candlebark School (opened 2006) in the Macedon Ranges. The school campus occupies a site of 80 acres of primarily bushland. Facilities include 15 classrooms, science laboratories, gymnasium, 10 metre indoor heated pool, tennis and basketball courts and a five-hole golf course.  Environment  The local bushland surrounding was Macedon was harvested extensively for timber since 1850s.  Macedon State Nursery  However the timber industry had so denuded the entire surrounding mountain range, that in 1872, the State Government established the 100 acre Macedon State Nursery, to encourage the replanting of the mountain and to supply seedlings to all parts of Victoria, which it did at no cost to public institutions such as schools, benevolent institutions, hospitals and reserves. By 1888, annual production was around 200,000 seedlings with a projected annual output by 1890 of 700,000-1 million plants. Newspaper articles from the late 19th and early 20th century describe the wide variety of plants that flourished at the State Nursery in spite of its poor topsoil and craggy terrain. Cool-climate trees like cypress, larch, cedar and pine thrived at the high altitude; deciduous species of oak, ash and birch grew well, as did native eucalypts and casuarinas. The majority of the trees that were propagated at the nursery were of European and English varieties with which the landowners were familiar, hence the unique character of many of the early avenues in nearby towns such as Gisborne and in the grand gardens of Mount Macedon. Trials of the cultivation of other crops such as tea and tobacco were undertaken, with little success. This nursery also provided employment for many of the former timber industry workers. Perhaps as a consequence of its success, Macedon Nursery periodically received complaints of unfair competition from the nursery industry until it was closed by the Government in 1995.  Timber Plantations  There are a number of established commercial timber plantations around Macedon in the Black Forest. The plantations were established by the State Government in 1880 and were privatised through the sale of the Victorian Plantations Corporation in 1998 to Hancock Timber Resource Group for $550 million to form Hancock Victorian Plantations (HVP). The Macedon Black Forest plantations are now owned and operated by a private company HVP Plantations.  Climate  Film and television industry Macedon is often known as the town from \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\", the 1975 mystery movie based on the novel of the same name. Parts of the 2009 Nicolas Cage film \\"Knowing\\" was shot around Macedon, most notably the local petrol station which was renovated to appear more like an American gas station. Most of the film was also shot nearby in Mount Macedon. The television series 'Chris Humfrey's Wild Life' was filmed in Macedon. The series aired in March 2011 on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The 2018 remake of Picnic at Hanging Rock was filmed in the region, and the award- winning score was composed in the region by local producer Jan Skubiszewski.

The colonial commissioner chose the members of each council from lists supplied by local officials.Ngoh 133. By establishing these bodies, the colonial regime hoped to reign in some of Cameroun's nationalist and pro-independence sentiment.DeLancey and DeLancey 89. The Councils were expected to uphold and support French policies. Other duties included acting as liaisons between the administration and local populations and alerting the regime as to the status of local projects such as tax collection and the construction of road and rail.

Although his aircraft experiments were belatedly successful, his early recognition and publicizing of the work of the Wright Brothers was a major influence on the development of aviation in Europe. Early life Born in Lyon in 1862, he studied at the Ecole Polytechnique before joining the Army, eventually becoming an instructor the School of Applied Artillery at Fontainbleau in 1897. It was here that he came across the work of Otto Lilienthal, through reading about his work in an article in the Illustrierte Zeitung. Aviation experiments Early attempts After some experimentation with models Ferber constructed his first full-size unmanned glider, which had a lozenge-shaped wing about across, and unsuccessfully attempted to fly it from a launching tower at his family's estate in Rue in Switzerland in August 1898. He then constructed a similar but smaller second machine, which he attempted to fly both as a kite and by towing it behind a horse, also without much success. In early 1901 Ferber was transferred from Fontainbleu to Nice, where he was placed in command of the 17th Alpine Battery of the 19th Regiment. Here he continued his experiments: his third attempt was more closely modelled on the pattern of Lillienthal's gliders, and was Ferber's first attempt at building a man-carrying glider. Trials were made at Saint-Etienne-de-Tin√©e, but the wing area proved insufficient for the purpose, and so a fourth, larger, glider was constructed. Contact with Chanute In 1901 Ferber became aware of the aeronautical experiments of Octave Chanute, a French-born American civil engineer, as a result of reading an article in the Revue Scientifique published in the issue dated 1 June 1901.C. H. Gibbs-Smith (1974) The Rebirth of European Aviation. London: HMSO, Ferber wrote to Chanute, and through him learnt of the experiments of the Wright Brothers, receiving a copy of Wilbur Wright's paper \\"Some Aeronautical Experiments\\" which had been published in the Journal of the Western Society of Engineers in December 1901. Ferber then built his fifth aircraft, based on photographs of the Wright's 1901 glider. This resembled the Wright glider in being a two-bay biplane with a forward elevator, but the resemblance ends there. As with Ferber's previous aircraft, the construction was crude in the extreme, the wings consisting merely of a simple framework of bamboo loosely covered with fabric, entirely lacking the ribs which formed the wings of the Wright's glider into a lift-giving aerofoil section. Moreover, there was no attempt at lateral control. The connection between lateral and directional control was the key discovery of the Wright Brothers, and although their 1901 glider lacked a rudder the use of wing warping was clearly described in the paper by Wilbur Wright. Ferber's experiments with this aircraft were encouraging, and an account of his work written by Ferber under his pseudonym \\"de Rue\\" was published in the February 1903 issue of l'A√©rophile. Ferber did not attend Chanute's lecture to the Aero Club de France in April 1903, but after hearing of it he wrote to Ernest Archdeacon, one of the founder members of the Aero Club. His letter asked Archdeacon to use his influence to get the Aero Club to announce a prize for a glider flight, and contained the exhortation (\\"The aeroplane must not be allowed to reach successful achievement in America\\"). His suggestion was enthusiastically endorsed by Archdeacon, who included an extract from Ferber's letter in his account of Chanute's lecture published in La Locomotion on 11 April: the letter was also published in the April issue of L'Aerophile. Ferber experiments Ferber then built another aircraft very similar to his 1902 glider. This differed principally in having a pair of triangular rudders mounted on the aft outboard interplane struts. This aircraft was then fitted with a 6 hp (4 kW) Buchet engine, driving a pair of coaxially mounted propellers, in which form it was called the Type V-bis. Between September 1903 and October 1904 a number of attempts at flight were made, and he also constructed a tall latticework tower supporting a long counterbalanced revolving arm from which the aircraft was suspended. Ferber wrote that trials of this machine \\"were completely useless, but drew public attention to aviation\\"Opdycke, Leonard E. (1999) French Aeroplanes Before the Great War, page 129, Atglen, PA: Schiffer In April 1904 Ferber assisted Ernest Archdeacon with the trials of his Wright-derived glider at Berck-sur-Mer. Shortly after this Charles Renard, commander of the French Army balloon school at Chalais-Meudon, invited Ferber to join this establishment, and he took up this new post in early May 1904. He also constructed another aircraft, the Type VI, notable for its use of a rear-mounted horizontal stabiliser and also featuring dihedral in an attempt to obtain lateral stability. In June 1905 Ferber wrote to the Wright Brothers offering to buy one of their machines. The Wrights were unwilling to do this but their reply, dated 9 October 1905, detailed the flights they had recently made, and so Ferber was the first European to learn of these achievements. After the death of Renard in April 1905 Ferber's relationship with the authorities at Chalais-Meudon deteriorated and in June 1906 he asked for three years leave, in order to work at the Antoinette company. This was granted in August 1906, and he also allowed to continue his experiments at Chalais-Meudon. In 1906 Ferber built his aeroplane type VIII, fitted with a 24 hp Antoinette engine. When parked outside of hangar, this aircraft was destroyed by a storm in November. Rebuilt as type IX, it was belatedly but successfully tested in July 1908 at Issy-les- Moulineaux near Paris. F. Ferber, L'aviation, ses d√©buts, son developpement, juillet 1908 In 1908, Ferber founded the Ligue Nationale A√©rienne with the help of the well-known physiologist Ren√© Quinton. Quinton was a member of a Parisian group of literary personalities called the \\"Forty-five,\\" who honored achievements in literature, sciences and arts. In May 1908 Ferber addressed the group at Quinton's suggestion and after receiving a standing ovation for his accomplishments in aviation, Quinton was inspired to establish a 10,000 francs prize for the first person to fly for 5 minutes with engine stopped and without losing more than 50 metres altitude.\\"Miscellaneous Prizes: the Ren√© Quinton Prize\\"Flight 17 April 1909 In May 1909 the Ligue opened a flying school at Juvisy, with Ferber as its chief instructor. Death Captain Ferber was killed on 22 September 1909 at a flying meeting in Boulogne, when, attempting a turn at low altitude in a Voisin biplane, one wing struck the ground.\\"The Use of Accidents\\"Flight 28 January 1911 He was only the third victim of an aeroplance accident after Thomas Selfridge and Eug√®ne Lefebvre. He was buried at the Cemetery of Loyasse in Lyon. In June 1910, the French Minister of War announced that one of their newly ordered Zodiac dirigibles was to be named Capitaine Ferber, and a memorial in the form of monolith bearing a bronze flying eagle was erected at Boulogne.\\"Memorial for Captain Ferber\\"Flight 15 July 1911 Gaston Combebiac wrote that Feber ought to be considered a member of the Quaternion Society when he contributed a biographical note to the Society's Bulletin:Gaston Combebiac (1912) Ferdinand Ferber, Bulletin of the Quaternion Society, link from HathiTrust :After all, since his intuition, at once mathematical and realistic, having not failed to recognize the advantages presented by the use of vector calculus for certain physical applications of mathematics, we must rank him among the members of our Association.

Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as Reychenwald. It is now served by the Saint Anne Church. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship.

An animal can exhibit visual fixation if they possess a fovea in the anatomy of their eye. The fovea is typically located at the center of the retina and is the point of clearest vision. The species in which fixational eye movement has been found thus far include humans, primates, cats, rabbits, turtles, salamanders, and owls. Regular eye movement alternates between saccades and visual fixations, the notable exception being in smooth pursuit, controlled by a different neural substrate that appears to have developed for hunting prey. The term \\"fixation\\" can either be used to refer to the point in time and space of focus or the act of fixating. Fixation, in the act of fixating, is the point between any two saccades, during which the eyes are relatively stationary and virtually all visual input occurs. In the absence of retinal jitter, a laboratory condition known as retinal stabilization, perceptions tend to rapidly fade away. To maintain visibility, the nervous system carries out a mechanism called fixational eye movement, which continuously stimulates neurons in the early visual areas of the brain responding to transient stimuli. There are three categories of fixational eye movements: microsaccades, ocular drifts, and ocular microtremor. Although the existence of these movements has been known since the 1950s, only recently their functions have started to become clear.  Microsaccades  The lines on this image display the saccadic and microsaccadic movements of a person's eye while they looked at this face. The involuntary, micro-saccadic movement is not steady when the person's eyes are concentrated at the eyes of the woman, while the voluntary, saccadic movement goes around the periphery of the face once at any give point. Microsaccades, also known as \\"flicks\\", are saccades, involuntarily produced during fixation periods. They are the largest and fastest of the fixational eye movements. Like saccades, microsaccades are usually binocular, and conjugate movements with comparable amplitudes and directions in both eyes. In the 1960s, scientists suggested the maximum amplitude for microsaccades should be 12 arcminutes to distinguish microsaccades and saccades. However, further studies have shown that microsaccades can certainly exceed this value. Therefore, amplitude can no longer be used to distinguish microsaccades and saccades. The only way to distinguish microsaccades from saccades is by the time in which they happen: during fixation. Regular saccades are produced during the active exploration of the eye, during non-fixation tasks such as free viewing or visual search. However, microsaccades are distinguished from regular saccades because they are only produced during fixation tasks. The circularity of this definition has been the subject of ample criticism.  Mechanism  Moving in a straight-line-fashion, microsaccades have the ability to carry the retinal image from several dozen to several hundred photoreceptor widths. Because they shift the retinal image, microsaccades overcome adaption and generate neural responses to stationary stimuli in visual neurons. These movements might serve the function of maintaining visibility during fixation, or might be related to attentional shifts to objects in the visual field or in memory, might help limit binocular fixation disparity, or may serve some combination of those functions.  Medical application  Some neuroscientists believe that microsaccades are potentially important in neurological and ophthalmic diseases since they are strongly related to many features of visual perception, attention, and cognition. Research aimed at finding the purpose of microsaccades began in the 1990s. The development of non-invasive eye-movement-recording devices, the ability to record single- neuron activity in monkeys, and the use of computational processing power in the analysis of dynamic behavior led to advancements in microsaccade research. Today, there is growing interest in research on microsaccades. Research on microsaccades includes investigating the perceptual effects of microsaccades, recording the neural responses they induce, and tracking the mechanisms behind their oculomotor generation. It has been shown that when fixation is not explicitly enforced as it often occurs in vision research experiments, microsaccades precisely shift gaze to nearby locations of interest. This behavior compensates for non-uniform vision within the foveola. Some studies suggest the use of microsaccades as a diagnostic method for ADHD. Adults diagnosed with ADHD but with no medication treatments tend to blink more and make more microsaccades. Microsaccades are also being explored as diagnostic measures for Progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, acute hypoxia, and other conditions.  Ocular drifts  Ocular drift is the fixational eye movement characterized by a smoother, slower, roaming motion of the eye when fixed on an object. The exact movement of ocular drift is often compared to Brownian motion, which is the random motion of a particle suspended in fluid as a result of its collision with the atoms and molecules that comprise that fluid. The movement can also be compared to a random walk, characterized by random and often erratic changes in direction. Ocular drifts occur incessantly during intersaccadic fixation. Although the frequency of ocular drifts is usually lower than the frequency of ocular microtremors (from 0 to 40 Hz compared to from 40 to 100 Hz), it is problematic to distinguish ocular drifts and ocular microtremors. In fact, microtremors might reflect the Brownian engine underlying the drift motion. Resolution of intersaccadic eye movements is technically challenging. Brownian Motion  Mechanism  The motion of ocular drift is related to the processing and encoding of space and time. It is also related to acquiring minute visual details of objects that are stationary, in order for these details to be further processed. Recent results have shown that ocular drift reformats the input signal to the retina equalizing (whitening) spatial power at non-zero temporal frequencies across a broad spatial frequency range.  Medical application  Ocular drifts were first found to be caused by an instability of the ocular motor system. However, more recent findings have shown that there are actually a number of suggested hypotheses as to why ocular drifts occur. First, ocular drifts can be caused by the uncontrollable random movements driven by neuronal or muscular noise. Second, ocular drifts can occur to counter controlled motor variables, namely a motor control loop. Lastly, ocular drifts can be driven by retinal information, in a retino-motor control loop. When the head is not immobilized, as in daily life and as is often true in eye movement recordings in the laboratory, ocular drifts compensate for the natural fixational instability of the head. Ocular drifts are altered by some neurologic conditions including Tourette syndrome and autism spectrum disorder  Ocular microtremors  Ocular microtremors (OMTs) are small, quick, and synchronized oscillations of the eyes occurring at frequencies in a range of 40 to 100 Hz, although they typically occur at around 90 Hz in the average healthy individual. They are characterized by their high frequency and minuscule amplitude of just a few arcseconds. Although the function of ocular microtremors is debatable and not fully known, they seem to play a role in processing of high spatial frequencies, which allows for perception of fine detail. Studies show that ocular microtremors have some promise as a tool for determining the level of consciousness in an individual, as well as the progression of some degenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Ocular microtremor tracing with burst sections underlined  Mechanism  Although originally thought to stem from spontaneous firing of motor units, the origin of ocular microtremors is now believed to be in the oculomotor nuclei in the reticular formation of the brainstem. This new insight opened the possibility of using ocular tremors as a gauge for neuronal activity in that region of the central nervous system. More research must be done, but recent studies strongly suggest that decreased activity in the brainstem correlates with decreased frequency of OMTs.  Medical application  Several methods of recording have been developed to observe these minuscule events, the most successful being the piezoelectric strain gauge method, which translates eye movement through a latex probe in contact with the eye leading to piezoelectric strain gauge. This method is used in research settings; more practical adaptations of this technology have been developed for use in clinical settings to monitor the depth of anesthesia. Despite the availability of these methods, tremor remains more difficult to measure than other fixational eye movements, and studies addressing medical applications of tremor movements are rare as a result. Some studies have, nevertheless, pointed to the possibility that tremor movements may be useful in assessing the progression of degenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

It also had operations in France, Germany, Ireland, Australia and Cyprus. The group's UK companies were placed into administration on 12 September 2008. History The company began as Excel Airways Group. It was bought by the Icelandic Avion Group in November 2004, previously being owned by the Icelandic Flugfelagid Atlanta HF. In October 2006, there was a $450m management buyout of the company, although the Avion Group retained 49% of the company. It became XL Leisure Group on 22 December 2006. The French subsidiary, XL Airways France, used to be Star Airlines, while the German subsidiary XL Airways Germany began as Star Europe. At its height, it flew from 12 UK airports. The Irish airline began in May 2006. Administration XL Leisure Group confirmed on their website that 11 companies associated with the group had been put into administration on 12 September 2008. This includes XL Airways UK Limited, Excel Aviation Limited, Explorer House Limited, Aspire Holidays Limited, Freedom Flights Limited, The Really Great Holiday Company plc, Travel City Direct. It was the biggest collapse of a British tour operator since 1974 when Court Line became insolvent, affecting 50,000 travellers. XL Airways Germany ceased operations in 2012, while XL Airways France ceased operations in 2019. Market share XLLG claimed it was the third largest tour operating company in the UK. Prior to entering administration, it was the main shirt sponsor of West Ham United F.C. until the club terminated the partnership with immediate effect on 12 September.  Member companies  At the time the Group entered administration in September 2008, it was made up of the following companies and shareholdings: Travel City Direct's TF-AME seen at Manchester Airport *Travel City Direct - A UK holiday company specialising in low-cost family holidays to Florida, other parts of the U.S. and the Caribbean. Flights were operated on behalf of Travel City Direct by XL Airways, using aircraft bearing dual-branded liveries. The brand was bought by Virgin Holidays in December 2008. * Freedom Flights - A seat- only tour operator which primarily sold airline seats to UK tour operators. The majority of its seats were with XLLG's own XL Airways, although Freedom Flights also dealt with seat sales on other airlines. * XL Holidays and Aspire Holidays - XL Holidays was the main tour-operating division of XLLG in the UK, offering holidays worldwide and was fully ATOL bonded. Aspire Holidays was a division of XL Holidays specialising in luxury bespoke holidays and was sold to Jeffersons Limited on 28 October 2008. * CrystalTO and Heliades - CrystalTO is a French tour operator fully affiliated to XL Airways France, offering French travelers package holidays worldwide. Heliades is a tour operator in France, specialising primarily in holidays to Greece. * XL Airways - Was a charter airline with brands in the UK, France and Germany. It began as Sabre Airways in 1994, and was renamed Excel Airways in 2001. It was later rebranded XL Airways in November 2006 after it was found that the airline was more commonly known by the British public as simply XL Airways. Following the acquisition of the French and German airlines Star Airlines and Star Europe, XLLG rebranded these as XL Airways France and XL Airways Germany in November 2006, creating a pan-European airline consisting of at least 34 Boeing and Airbus aircraft. *XL Aviation and XL24 - XL Aviation was the commercial sales arm of XLLG. It sold charter capacity on flights operated by XL Airways and also bought and sold charter capacity on numerous other airlines. XL24 was a dealer in \\"relief\\" aircraft in the airline-to-airline market, providing sub- chartered aircraft from the XL Airways and other fleets to other airlines who required the extra capacity on short notice. * Interests in: **Xtra Airways and Skywest, Inc. - Established in 1987, Xtra Airways is a charter airline based in Nevada, USA. It now has bases at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Louisville, Kentucky, New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and Boston. It is owned by CXP Management, and XLLG holds a 19% share of the airline. Prior to XLLG's acquisition of 19% interest in Xtra Airways in summer 2005, the airline was known as Casino Express. The rebranding to Xtra Airways reflects a close relationship between Xtra and XL, which also includes similar aircraft liveries. **Skywest is an Australian regional airline, which began operations in 1963 as part of Ansett Airlines.

Chamber groups traditionally perform publicly from score rather than from memory. Eye movement in music reading is the scanning of a musical score by a musician's eyes. This usually occurs as the music is read during performance, although musicians sometimes scan music silently to study it. The phenomenon has been studied by researchers from a range of backgrounds, including cognitive psychology and music education. These studies have typically reflected a curiosity among performing musicians about a central process in their craft, and a hope that investigating eye movement might help in the development of more effective methods of training musicians' sight reading skills. A central aspect of music reading is the sequence of alternating saccades and fixations, as it is for most oculomotor tasks. Saccades are the rapid ‚Äòflicks‚Äô that move the eyes from location to location over a music score. Saccades are separated from each other by fixations, during which the eyes are relatively stationary on the page. It is well established that the perception of visual information occurs almost entirely during fixations and that little if any information is picked up during saccades.e.g., Matin (1974) Fixations comprise about 90% of music reading time, typically averaging 250‚Äì400 ms in duration.e.g., Goolsby, 1987; Smith, 1988 Eye movement in music reading is an extremely complex phenomenon that involves a number of unresolved issues in psychology, and which requires intricate experimental conditions to produce meaningful data. Despite some 30 studies in this area over the past 70 years, little is known about the underlying patterns of eye movement in music reading.  Relationship with eye movement in language reading  An excerpt from one of JS Bach's compositions for keyboard: a player's scanpath across such a score will be a complex pattern of horizontal and vertical movement. Eye movement in music reading may at first appear to be similar to that in language reading, since in both activities the eyes move over the page in fixations and saccades, picking up and processing coded meanings. However, it is here that the obvious similarities end. Not only is the coding system of music nonlinguistic; it involves what is apparently a unique combination of features among human activities: a strict and continuous time constraint on an output that is generated by a continuous stream of coded instructions. Even the reading of language aloud, which, like musical performance involves turning coded information into a musculoskeletal response, is relatively free of temporal constraint‚Äîthe pulse in reading aloud is a fluid, improvised affair compared with its rigid presence in most Western music. It is this uniquely strict temporal requirement in musical performance that has made the observation of eye movement in music reading fraught with more difficulty than that in language reading. Another critical difference between reading music and reading language is the role of skill. Most people become reasonably efficient at language reading by adulthood, even though almost all language reading is sight reading.Sloboda (1985) By contrast, some musicians regard themselves as poor sight readers of music even after years of study. Thus, the improvement of music sight reading and the differences between skilled and unskilled readers have always been of prime importance to research into eye movement in music reading, whereas research into eye movement in language reading has been more concerned with the development of a unified psychological model of the reading process.Rayner et al. (1990) It is therefore unsurprising that most research into eye movement in music reading has aimed to compare the eye movement patterns of the skilled and the unskilled.  Equipment and related methodology  From the start, there were basic problems with eye-tracking equipment. The five earliest studies(Jacobsen 1941; Weaver 1943; Weaver & Nuys 1943; York 1951; and Lang 1961) used photographic techniques. These methods involved either training a continuous beam of visible light onto the eye to produce an unbroken line on photographic paper, or a flashing light to produce a series of white spots on photographic paper at sampling intervals around 25 ms (i.e., 40 samples a second). Because the film rolled through the device vertically, the vertical movement of the eyes in their journey across the page was either unrecordedJacobsen 1941; York 1951; and Lang 1961 or was recorded using a second camera and subsequently combined to provide data on both dimensions, a cumbersome and inaccurate solution. These systems were sensitive to even small movement of the head or body, which appear to have significantly contaminated the data. Some studies used devices such as a headrest and bite-plate to minimise this contamination, with limited success, and in one case a camera affixed to a motorcycle helmet‚Äîweighing nearly 3 kg‚Äîwhich was supported by a system of counterbalancing weights and pulleys attached to the ceiling.Young 1971) In addition to extraneous head movement, researchers faced other physical, bodily problems. The musculoskeletal response required to play a musical instrument involves substantial body movement, usually of the hands, arms and torso. This can upset the delicate balance of tracking equipment and confound the registration of data. Another issue that affects almost all unskilled keyboardists and a considerable proportion of skilled keyboardists is the common tendency to frequently glance down at the hands and back to the score during performance. The disadvantage of this behaviour is that it causes signal dropout in the data every time it occurs, which is sometimes up to several times per bar.Weaver (1943), York (1951) and Young (1971) When participants are prevented from looking down at their hands, typically the quality of their performance is degraded. Rayner & Pollatsek (1997:49) wrote that: :\\"even skilled musicians naturally look at their hands at times. ... [Because] accurate eye movement recording [is generally incompatible with] these head movements ... musicians often need appreciable training with the apparatus before their eye movements can be measured.\\" Since Lang (1961), all reported studies into eye movement in music reading, aside from Smith (1988), appear to have used infrared tracking technology. However, research into the field has mostly been conducted using less than optimal equipment. This has had a pervasive negative impact on almost all research up until a few recent studies. In summary, the four main equipment problems have been that tracking devices: *measured eye movement inaccurately or provided insufficient data; *were uncomfortable for participants and therefore risked a reduction in ecological validity; *did not allow for the display of records of eye movement in relation to the musical score, or at least made such a display difficult to achieve; and *were adversely affected by most participants' tendency to look down at their hands, to move their bodies significantly during performance, and to blink. Not until recently has eye movement in music reading been investigated with more satisfactory equipment. Kinsler and Carpenter (1995) were able to identify eye position to within 0.25¬∫, that is, the size of the individual musical notes, at intervals of 1 ms. Truitt et al. (1997) used a similarly accurate infrared system capable of displaying a movement window and integrated into a computer-monitored musical keyboard. Waters & Underwood (1998) used a machine with an accuracy of plus or minus one character space and a sampling interval of only 4 ms.  Tempo and data contamination  Most research into eye movement in music reading has primarily aimed to compare the eye movement patterns of skilled and unskilled performers.e.g., Weaver (1943), Young (1971), Goolsby (1987) The implicit presumption appears to have been that this might lay the foundation for developing better ways of training musicians. However, there are significant methodological problems in attempting this comparison. Skilled and unskilled performers typically sight read the same passage at different tempos and/or levels of accuracy. At a sufficiently slow tempo, players over a large range of skill-levels are capable of accurate performance, but the skilled will have excess capacity in their perception and processing of the information on the page. There is evidence that excess capacity contaminates eye-movement data with a ‚Äòwandering‚Äô effect, in which the eyes tend to stray from the course of the music. Weaver (1943:15) implied the existence of the wandering effect and its confounding influence, as did Truitt et al. (1997:51), who suspected that at slow tempo their participants' eyes were \\"hanging around rather than extracting information\\". The wandering effect is undesirable, because it is an unquantifiable and possibly random distortion of normal eye movement patterns. Souter (2001:81) claimed that the ideal tempo for observing eye movement is a range lying between one that is so fast as to produce a significant level of action slips, and one that is so slow as to produce a significant wandering effect. The skilled and the unskilled have quite different ranges for sight reading the same music. On the other hand, a faster tempo may minimise excess capacity in the skilled, but will tend to induce inaccurate performance in the unskilled; inaccuracies rob us of the only evidence that a performer has processed the information on the page, and the danger cannot be discounted that feedback from action-slips contaminates eye movement data. Almost all studies have compared temporal variables among participants, chiefly the durations of their fixations and saccades. In these cases, it is self-evident that useful comparisons require consistency in performance tempo and accuracy within and between performances. However, most studies have accommodated their participants‚Äô varied performance ability in the reading of the same stimulus, by allowing them to choose their own tempo or by not strictly controlling that tempo. Theoretically, there is a relatively narrow range, referred to here as the ‚Äòoptimal range‚Äô, in which capacity matches the task at hand; on either side of this range lie the two problematic tempo ranges within which a performer‚Äôs capacity is excessive or insufficient, respectively. The location of the boundaries of the optimal range depends on the skill-level of an individual performer and the relative difficulty of reading/performing the stimulus.Souter (2001:80‚Äì81) Thus, unless participants are drawn from a narrow range of skill-levels, their optimal ranges will be mutually exclusive, and observations at a single, controlled tempo will be likely to result in significant contamination of eye movement data. Most studies have sought to compare the skilled and the unskilled in the hope of generating pedagogically useful data; aside from Smith (1988), in which tempo itself was an independent variable, Polanka (1995), who analysed only data from silent preparatory readings, and Souter (2001), who observed only the highly skilled, none has set out to control tempo strictly. Investigators have apparently attempted to overcome the consequences of the fallacy by making compromises, such as (1) exercising little or no control over the tempos at which participants performed in trials, and/or (2) tolerating significant disparity in the level of action slips between skilled and unskilled groups. This issue is part of the broader tempo/skill/action-slip fallacy, which concerns the relationship between tempo, skill and the level of action slips (performance errors).Souter (2001:80‚Äì85) The fallacy is that it is possible to reliably compare the eye movement patterns of skilled and unskilled performers under the same conditions.  Musical complexity  Many researchers have been interested in learning whether fixation durations are influenced by the complexity of the music. At least three types of complexity need to be accounted for in music reading: the visual complexity of the musical notation; the complexity of processing visual input into musculoskeletal commands; and the complexity of executing those commands. For example, visual complexity might be in the form of the density of the notational symbols on the page, or of the presence of accidentals, triplet signs, slurs and other expression markings. The complexity of processing visual input into musculoskeletal commands might involve a lack of 'chunkability' or predictability in the music. The complexity of executing musculoskeletal commands might be seen in terms of the demands of fingering and hand position. It is in isolating and accounting for the interplay between these types that the difficulty lies in making sense of musical complexity. For this reason, little useful information has emerged from investigating the relationship between musical complexity and eye movement. Jacobsen (1941:213) concluded that \\"the complexity of the reading material influenced the number and the duration of [fixations]\\"; where the texture, rhythm, key and accidentals were \\"more difficult\\", there was, on average, a slowing of tempo and an increase in both the duration and the number of fixations in his participants. However, performance tempos were uncontrolled in this study, so the data on which this conclusion was based are likely to have been contaminated by the slower tempos that were reported for the reading of the more difficult stimuli.Souter (2001:90) Weaver (1943) claimed that fixation durations‚Äîwhich ranged from 270‚Äì530 ms‚Äîlengthened when the notation was more compact and/or complex, as Jacobsen had found, but did not disclose whether slower tempos were used. Halverson (1974), who controlled tempo more closely, observed a mild opposite effect. Schmidt's (1981) participants used longer fixation durations in reading easier melodies (consistent with Halverson); Goolsby's (1987) data mildly supported Halverson's finding, but only for skilled readers. He wrote \\"both Jacobsen and Weaver ... in letting participants select their own tempo found the opposite effect of notational complexity\\".Goolsby 1987:107 On balance, it appears likely that under controlled temporal conditions, denser and more complex music is associated with a higher number of fixations, of shorter mean duration. This might be explained as an attempt by the music-reading process to provide more frequent 'refreshment' of the material being held in working memory, and may compensate for the need to hold more information in working memory.Souter (2001:89‚Äì90)  Reader skill  There is no disagreement among the major studies, from Jacobsen (1941) to Smith (1988), that skilled readers appear to use more and shorter fixations across all conditions than do the unskilled. Goolsby (1987) found that mean 'progressive' (forward-moving) fixation duration was significantly longer (474 versus 377 ms) and mean saccade length significantly greater for the less skilled. Although Goolsby did not report the total reading durations of his trials, they can be derived from the mean tempos of his 12 skilled and 12 unskilled participants for each of the four stimuli.Goolsby (1987:88), assuming there were no extraneous methodological factor, such as failing to exclude from total durations the 'return-sweep' saccades and non-reading time at the start and end of readings. His data appear to show that the unskilled played at 93.6% of the tempo of the skilled, and that their mean fixation durations were 25.6% longer. This raises the question as to why skilled readers should distribute more numerous and shorter fixations over a score than the unskilled. Only one plausible explanation appears in the literature. Kinsler & Carpenter (1995) proposed a model for the processing of music notation, based on their data from the reading of rhythm patterns, in which an iconic representation of each fixated image is scanned by a 'processor' and interpreted to a given level of accuracy. The scan ends when this level cannot be reached, its end-point determining the position of the upcoming fixation. The time taken before this decision depends on the complexity of a note, and is presumably shorter for skilled readers, thus promoting more numerous fixations of shorter duration. This model has not been further investigated, and does not explain what advantage there is to using short, numerous fixations. Another possible explanation is that skilled readers maintain a larger eye‚Äìhand span and therefore hold a larger amount of information in their working memory; thus, they need to refresh that information more frequently from the music score, and may do so by refixating more frequently.Souter (2001:91‚Äì92)  Stimulus familiarity  Caravaggio's Rest on the Flight into Egypt (1594‚Äì96) The more familiar readers become with a musical excerpt, the less their reliance on visual input from the score and the correspondingly greater reliance on their stored memory of the music. On logical grounds, it would be expected that this shift would result in fewer and longer fixations. The data from all three studies into eye movement in the reading of increasingly familiar music support this reasoning. York's (1952) participants read each stimulus twice, with each reading preceded by a 28-second silent preview. On average, both skilled and unskilled readers used fewer and longer fixations during the second reading. Goolsby's (1987) participants were observed during three immediately successive readings of the same musical stimulus. Familiarity in these trials appeared to increase fixation duration, but not nearly as much as might have been expected. The second reading produced no significant difference in mean fixation duration (from 422 to 418 ms). On the third encounter, mean fixation duration was higher for both groups (437 ms) but by a barely significant amount, thus mildly supporting York's earlier finding. The smallness of these changes might be explained by the unchallenging reading conditions in the trials. The tempo of MM120 suggested at the start of each of Goolsby's trials appears to be slow for tackling the given melodies, which contained many semibreves and minims, and there may have simply been insufficient pressure to produce significant results. A more likely explanation is that the participants played the stimuli at faster tempos as they grew more familiar with them through the three readings. (The metronome was initially sounded, but was silent during the performances, allowing readers to vary their pace at will.) Thus, it is possible that two influences were at odds with each other: growing familiarity may have promoted low numbers of fixations, and long fixation durations, while faster tempo may have promoted low numbers and short durations. This might explain why mean fixation duration fell in the opposite direction to the prediction for the second encounter, and by the third encounter had risen by only 3.55% across both groups.Souter (2001:93) (Smith's (1988) results, reinforced by those of Kinsler & Carpenter (1995), suggest that faster tempos are likely to reduce both the number and duration of fixations in the reading of a single-line melody. If this hypothesis is correct, it may be connected with the possibility that the more familiar a stimulus, the less the workload on the reader's memory.)  Top‚Äìdown/bottom‚Äìup question  There was considerable debate from the 1950s to 1970s as to whether eye movement in language reading is solely or mainly influenced by (1) the pre-existing (top‚Äìdown) behavioural patterns of an individual's reading technique, (2) the nature of the stimulus (bottom‚Äìup), or (3) both factors. Rayner et al. (1971) provides a review of the relevant studies. Decades before this debate, Weaver (1943) had set out to determine the (bottom‚Äìup) effects of musical texture on eye movement. He hypothesised that vertical compositional patterns in a two-stave keyboard score would promote vertical saccades, and horizontal compositional patterns horizontal saccades. Weaver's participants read a two-part polyphonic stimulus in which the musical patterns were strongly horizontal, and a four-part homophonic stimulus comprising plain, hymn-like chords, in which the compositional patterns were strongly vertical. Weaver was apparently unaware of the difficulty of proving this hypothesis in the light of the continual need to scan up and down between the staves and move forward along the score. Thus, it is unsurprising that the hypothesis was not confirmed. Four decades later, when evidence was being revealed of the bottom‚Äìup influence on eye movement in language reading, Sloboda (1985) was interested in the possibility that there might be an equivalent influence on eye movement in music reading, and appeared to assume that Weaver's hypothesis had been confirmed. \\"Weaver found that [the vertical] pattern was indeed used when the music was homophonic and chordal in nature. When the music was contrapuntal, however, he found fixation sequences which were grouped in horizontal sweeps along a single line, with a return to another line afterwards.\\"Sloboda (1985:70) To support this assertion, Sloboda quoted two one-bar fragments taken from Weaver's illustrations that do not appear to be representative of the overall examples.Souter (2001:97) Although Sloboda's claim may be questionable, and despite Weaver's failure to find dimensional links between eye movement and stimulus, eye movement in music reading shows clear evidence in most studies‚Äîin particular, Truit et al. (1997) and Goolsby (1987)‚Äîof the influence of bottom‚Äìup graphical features and top‚Äìdown global factors related to the meaning of the symbols.  Peripheral visual input  The role of peripheral visual input in language reading remains the subject of much research. Peripheral input in music reading was a particular focus of Truitt et al. (1997). They used the gaze-contingency paradigm to measure the extent of peripheral perception to the right of a fixation. This paradigm involves the spontaneous manipulation of a display in direct response to where the eyes are gazing at any one point of time. Performance was degraded only slightly when four crotchets to the right were presented as the ongoing preview, but significantly when only two crotchets were presented. Under these conditions, peripheral input extended over a little more than a four-beat measure, on average. For the less skilled, useful peripheral perception extended from half a beat up to between two and four beats. For the more skilled, useful peripheral perception extended up to five beats. Peripheral visual input in music reading is clearly in need of more investigation, particularly now that the paradigm has become more accessible to researchers. A case could be made that Western music notation has developed in such a way as to optimise the use of peripheral input in the reading process. Noteheads, stems, beams, barlines and other notational symbols are all sufficiently bold and distinctive to be useful when picked up peripherally, even when at some distance from the fovea. The upcoming pitch contour and prevailing rhythmic values of a musical line can typically be ascertained ahead of foveal perception. For example, a run of continuous semiquavers beamed together by two thick, roughly horizontal beams, will convey potentially valuable information about rhythm and texture, whether to the right on the currently fixated stave, or above, or above or below in a neighbouring stave. This is reason enough to suspect that the peripheral preprocessing of notational information is a factor in fluent music reading, just as it has been found to be the case for language reading. This would be consistent with the findings of Smith (1988) and Kinsler & Carpenter (1995), who reported that the eyes do not fixate on every note in the reading of melodies.  Refixation  A refixation is a fixation on information that has already been fixated on during the same reading. In the reading of two-stave keyboard music, there are two forms of refixation: (1) up or down within a chord, after the chord has already been inspected on both staves (vertical refixation), and (2) leftward refixation to a previous chord (either back horizontally on the same stave or diagonally to the other stave). These are analogous to Pollatsek & Rayner‚Äôs two categories of refixation in the reading of language: (1) ‚Äúsame-word rightward refixation‚Äù, i.e., on different syllables in the same word, and (2) ‚Äúleftward refixation‚Äù to previously read words (also known as ‚Äúregression‚Äù).Pollatsek & Rayner (1990:153) Leftward refixation occurs in music reading at all skill-levels.Goolsby (1987), Smith (1988) It involves a saccade back to the previous note/chord (occasionally even back two notes/chords), followed by at least one returning saccade to the right, to regain lost ground. Weaver reported that leftward regressions run from 7% to a substantial 23% of all saccades in the sight-reading of keyboard music. Goolsby and Smith reported significant levels of leftward refixation across all skill-levels in the sight-reading of melodies. Looking at the same information more than once is, prima facie, a costly behaviour that must be weighed against the need to keep pace with the tempo of the music. Leftward refixation involves a greater investment of time than vertical refixation, and on logical grounds is likely to be considerably less common. For the same reason, the rates of both forms of refixation are likely to be sensitive to tempo, with lower rates at faster speed to meet the demand for making swifter progress across the score. Souter confirmed both of these suppositions in the skilled sight-reading of keyboard music. He found that at slow tempo (one chord a second), 23.13% (SD 5.76%) of saccades were involved in vertical refixation compared with 5.05% (4.81%) in leftward refixation (p < 0.001). At fast tempo (two chords a second), the rates were 8.15% (SD 4.41%) for vertical refixation compared with 2.41% (2.37%) for leftward refixation (p = 0.011). These significant differences occurred even though recovery saccades were included in the counts for leftward refixations, effectively doubling their number. The reductions in the rate of vertical refixation upon the doubling of tempo was highly significant (p < 0.001), but for leftward refixation was not (p = 0.209), possibly because of the low baseline.Souter (2001:138,140)  Eye‚Äìhand span  WA Mozart meets violinist Thomas Linley in 1770, anon. French painting, 18th century The eye‚Äìhand span (EHS) is the separation between eye position on the score and hand position. It can be measured in two ways: in notes (the number of notes between hand and eye; the 'note index'), or in time (the length of time between fixation and performance; the 'time index'). The main findings in relation to the eye‚Äìvoice span in the reading aloud of language were that (1) a larger span is associated with faster, more skilled readers,e.g., Buswell (1920), Judd and Buswell (1922), Tinker (1958), Morton (1964) (2) a shorter span is associated with greater stimulus- difficulty,Buswell (1920), Lawson (1961), Morton (1964) and (3) the span appears to vary according to linguistic phrasing.Levin and Kaplin (1970), Levin and Addis (1980) At least eight studies into eye movement in music reading have investigated analogous issues. For example, Jacobsen (1941) measured the average span to the right in the sight singing of melodies as up to two notes for the unskilled and between one and four notes for the skilled, whose faster average tempo in that study raises doubt as to whether skill alone was responsible for this difference. In Weaver (1943:28), the eye‚Äìhand span varied greatly, but never exceeded 'a separation of eight successive notes or chords, a figure that seems impossibly large for the reading of keyboard scores. Young (1971) found that both skilled and unskilled participants previewed about one chord ahead of their hands, an uncertain finding in view of the methodological problems in that study. Goolsby (1994) found that skilled sight singers' eyes were on average about four beats ahead of their voice, and less for the unskilled. He claimed that when sight singing, 'skilled music readers look farther ahead in the notation and then back to the point of performance' (p. 77). To put this another way, skilled music readers maintain a larger eye‚Äìhand span and are more likely to refixate within it. This association between span size and leftward refixation could arise from a greater need for the refreshment of information in working memory. Furneax & Land (1999) found that professional pianists' spans are significantly larger than those of amateurs. The time index was significantly affected by the performance tempo: when fast tempos were imposed on performance, all participants showed a reduction in the time index (to about 0.7 s), and slow tempos increased the time index (to about 1.3 s). This means that the length of time that information is stored in the buffer is related to performance tempo rather than ability, but that professionals can fit more information into their buffers.Furneax S & Land MF (1999) The effects of skill on the eye-hand span during musical sight-reading, Proceedings: Biological Sciences, 266, 2435‚Äì40 Sloboda (1974, 1977) cleverly applied Levin & Kaplin's (1970) 'light-out' method in an experiment designed to measure the size of the span in music reading. Sloboda (1977) asked his participants to sight read a melody and turned the lights out at an unpredictable point during each reading. The participants were instructed to continue playing correctly 'without guessing' for as long as they could after visual input was effectively removed, giving an indication as to how far ahead of their hands they were perceiving at that moment. Here, the span was defined as including peripheral input. Participants were allowed to choose their own performing speed for each piece, introducing a layer of uncertainty into the interpretation of the results. Sloboda reported that there was a tendency for the span to coincide with the musical phrasing, so that 'a boundary just beyond the average span \\"stretches\\" the span, and a boundary just before the average \\"contracts\\" it' (as reported in Sloboda 1985:72). Good readers, he found, maintain a larger span size (up to seven notes) than do poor readers (up to four notes). Truitt et al. (1997) found that in sight reading melodies on the electronic keyboard, span size averaged a little over one beat and ranged from two beats behind the currently fixated point to an incredibly large 12 beats ahead. The normal range of span size was rather smaller: between one beat behind and three beats ahead of the hands for 88% of the total reading duration, and between 0 and 2 beats ahead for 68% of the duration. Such large ranges, in particular, those that extend leftwards from the point of fixation, may have been due to the 'wandering effect'. For the less skilled, the average span was about half a crotchet beat. For the skilled, the span averaged about two beats and useful peripheral perception extended up to five beats. This, in the view of Rayner & Pollatsek (1997:52), suggests that: :\\"a major constraint on tasks that require translation of complex inputs into continuous motor transcription is [the limited capacity of] short-term memory. If the encoding process gets too far ahead of the output, there is likely to be a loss of material that is stored in the queue.\\" Rayner & Pollatsek (1997:52) explained the size of the eye‚Äìhand span as a continuous tug-o-war, as it were, between two forces: (1) the need for material to be held in working memory long enough to be processed into musculoskeletal commands, and (2) the need to limit the demand on span size and therefore the workload in the memory system. They claimed that most music pedagogy supports the first aspect [in advising] the student that the eyes should be well ahead of the hands for effective sight reading. They held that despite such advice, for most readers, the second aspect prevails; that is, the need to limit the workload of the memory system. This, they contended, results in a very small span under normal conditions.  Tempo  Smith (1988) found that when tempo is increased, fixations are fewer in number and shorter in mean duration, and that fixations tend to be spaced further apart on the score. Kinsler & Carpenter (1995) investigated the effect of increased tempo in reading rhythmic notation, rather than real melodies. They similarly found that increased tempo causes a decrease in mean fixation duration and an increase in mean saccade amplitude (i.e., the distance on the page between successive fixations). Souter (2001) used novel theory and methodology to investigate the effects of tempo on key variables in the sight reading of highly skilled keyboardists. Eye movement studies have typically measured saccade and fixation durations as separate variables. Souter (2001) used a novel variable: pause duration. This is a measure of the duration between the end of one fixation and the end of the next; that is, the sum of the duration of each saccade and of the fixation it leads to. Using this composite variable brings into play a simple relationship between the number of pauses, their mean duration, and the tempo: the number of pauses factored by their mean duration equals the total reading duration. In other words, the time taken to read a passage equals the sum of the durations of the individual pauses, or nd = r, where n is the number of pauses, d is their mean duration, and r is the total reading time. Since the total reading duration is inversely proportional to the tempo‚Äîdouble the tempo and the total reading time will be halved‚Äîthe relationship can be expressed as nd is proportional to r, where t is tempo. This study observed the effect of a change in tempo on the number and mean duration of pauses; thus, now using the letters to represent proportional changes in values, nd = 1‚ÅÑt, where n is the proportional change in pause number, d is the proportional change in their mean duration, and t is the proportional change in tempo. This expression describes a number‚Äìduration curve, in which the number and mean duration of pauses form a hyperbolic relationship (since neither n nor d ever reaches zero). The curve represents the range of possible ratios for using these variables to adapt to a change in tempo. In Souter (2001), tempo was doubled from the first to the second reading, from 60 to 120 MM; thus, t = 2, and the number‚Äìduration curve is described by nd = 0.5 (Figure 2). In other words, factoring the proportional change in the number and mean duration of pauses between these readings will always equal ¬Ω. Each participant‚Äôs two readings thus corresponded to a point on this curve. Irrespective of the value of t, all number‚Äìduration curves pass through three points of theoretical interest: two ‚Äòsole-contribution‚Äô points and one ‚Äòequal-contribution‚Äô point. At each sole-contribution point, a reader has relied entirely on one of the two variables to adapt to a new tempo. In Souter's study, if a participant adapted to the doubling of tempo by using the same number of pauses and halving their mean duration, the reading would fall on the sole-contribution point (1.0,0.5). Conversely, if a participant adapted by halving the number of pauses and maintaining their mean duration, the reading would fall on the other sole-contribution point (0.5,1.0). These two points represent completely one-sided behaviour. On the other hand, if a reader‚Äôs adaptation drew on both variables equally, and factoring them gives 0.5, they must both equal the square root of t (since t = 2 in this case, the square root of 2). The adaptation thus fell on the equal-contribution point: (1/\\\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\\\sqrt{2}), equivalent to (0.707,0.707). Predicting where performers would fall on the curve involved considering the possible advantages and disadvantages of using these two adaptive resources. A strategy of relying entirely on altering pause duration to adapt to a new tempo‚Äîfalling on (1.0,0.5)‚Äîwould permit the same number of pauses to be used irrespective of tempo. Theoretically, this would enable readers to use a standardised scanpath across a score, whereas if they changed the number of their pauses to adapt to a new tempo, their scanpath would need to be redesigned, sacrificing the benefits of a standardised approach. There is no doubt that readers are able to change their pause duration and number both from moment to moment and averaged over longer stretches of reading. Musicians typically use a large range of fixation durations within a single reading, even at a stable tempo.e.g., Smith (1988) Indeed, successive fixation durations appear to vary considerably, and seemingly at random; one fixation might be 200 ms, the next 370 ms, and the next 240 ms. (There are no data on successive pause durations in the literature, so mean fixation duration is cited here as a near- equivalent.) Seven of Souter's (2001:139) nine participants clustered around the equal-contribution pointIn the light of this flexibility in varying fixation duration, and since the process of picking up, processing and performing the information on the page is elaborate, it might be imagined that readers prefer to use a standardised scanpath. For example, in four-part, hymn-style textures for keyboard, such as were used in Souter (2001), the information on the score is presented as a series of two-note, optically separated units‚Äîtwo allocated to an upper stave and two to a lower stave for each chord. A standardised scanpath might consist of a sequence of ‚Äòsaw-tooth‚Äô movements from the upper stave to the lower stave for a chord, then diagonally across to the upper stave and down to the lower stave of the next chord, and so on. However, numerous studiese.g., Weaver (1943), Goolsby (1987) have shown that scanpaths in the reading of a number of musical textures‚Äîincluding melody, four-part hymns, and counterpoint‚Äîare not predictable and orderly, but are inherently changeable, with a certain ragged, ad-hoc quality. Music readers appear to turn their backs on the theoretical advantage of standardised scanpath: they are either flexible or ad hoc when it comes to the number of pauses‚Äîjust as they are with respect to their pause durations‚Äîand do not scan a score in a strict, predetermined manner. Souter hypothesised that the most likely scenario is that both pause duration and number are used to adapt to tempo, and that a number‚Äìduration relationship that lies close to the equal-contribution point allows the apparatus the greatest flexibility to adapt to further changes in reading conditions. He reasoned that it may be dysfunctional to use only one of two available adaptive resources, since that would make it more difficult to subsequently use that direction for further adaptation. This hypothesis‚Äîthat when tempo is increased, the mean number‚Äìduration relationship will be in the vicinity of the equal-contribution point‚Äîwas confirmed by the data in terms of the mean result: when tempo doubled, both the mean number of pauses per chord and the mean pause duration overall fell such that the mean number‚Äìduration relationship was (0.705,0.709), close to the equal-contribution point of (0.708, 0.708), with standard deviations of (0.138,0.118). Thus, the stability of scanpath‚Äîtenable only when the relationship is (0.5,1.0)‚Äîwas sacrificed to maintain a relatively stable mean pause duration.Souter (2001:137). Mean pause duration was 368 ms at slow tempo (SD = 44 ms) falling to 263 ms at fast tempo (SD = 42 ms), t(8) = 5.75, p < 0.001. Correspondingly, the mean number of pauses per chord fell from a mean of 2.75 (SD = 0.30) at slow tempo to 1.94 (SD = 0.28) at fast tempo, t(8) = 6.97, p < 0.001. This challenged the notion that scanpath (largely or solely) reflects the horizontal or vertical emphasis of the musical texture, as proposed by Sloboda (1985) and Weaver (1943), since these dimensions depend significantly on tempo.  Conclusions  Both logical inference and evidence in the literature point to the fact that there are three oculomotor imperatives in the task of eye movement in music reading. The first imperative seems obvious: the eyes must maintain a pace across the page that is appropriate to the tempo of the music, and they do this by manipulating the number and durations of fixations, and thereby the scanpath across the score. The second imperative is to provide an appropriate rate of refreshment of the information being stored and processed in working memory by manipulating the number and duration of fixations. This workload appears to be related to tempo, stimulus complexity and stimulus familiarity, and there is strong evidence that the capacity for high workload in relation to these variables is also connected with the skill of the reader. The third imperative is to maintain a span size that is appropriate to the reading conditions. The span must not be so small that there is insufficient time to perceive visual input and process it into musculoskeletal commands; it must not be so large that the capacity of the memory system to store and process information is exceeded. Musicians appear to use oculomotor commands to address all three imperatives simultaneously, which are in effect mapped onto each other in the reading process. Eye movement thus embodies a fluid set of characteristics that are not only intimately engaged in engineering the optimal visual input to the apparatus, but in servicing the process of that information in the memory system.Souter (2001:103)  Notes   References  *Drai-Zerbib V & Baccino T (2005) L'expertise dans la lecture musicale: int√©gration intermodale [Expertise in music reading: intermodal integration].

This terminology is generally, although not exclusively, used in reference to prokaryotes, whose genomes are often organized into operons; the genes contained within a regulon are usually organized into more than one operon at disparate locations on the chromosome. Applied to eukaryotes, the term refers to any group of non-contiguous genes controlled by the same regulatory gene. A modulon is a set of regulons or operons that are collectively regulated in response to changes in overall conditions or stresses, but may be under the control of different or overlapping regulatory molecules. The term stimulon is sometimes used to refer to the set of genes whose expression responds to specific environmental stimuli. Examples Commonly studied regulons in bacteria are those involved in response to stress such as heat shock. The heat shock response in E. coli is regulated by the sigma factor œÉ32 (RpoH), whose regulon has been characterized as containing at least 89 open reading frames. Regulons involving virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria are of particular research interest; an often-studied example is the phosphate regulon in E. coli, which couples phosphate homeostasis to pathogenicity through a two-component system. Regulons can sometimes be pathogenicity islands. The Ada regulon in E. coli is a well-characterized example of a group of genes involved in the adaptive response form of DNA repair. Quorum sensing behavior in bacteria is a commonly cited example of a modulon or stimulon, though some sources describe this type of intercellular auto-induction as a separate form of regulation. Evolution Changes in the regulation of gene networks are a common mechanism for prokaryotic evolution. An example of the effects of different regulatory environments for homologous proteins is the DNA-binding protein OmpR, which is involved in response to osmotic stress in E. coli but is involved in response to acidic environments in the close relative Salmonella Typhimurium.

The organisation‚Äôs members are mainly owners and operators of nuclear power plants. It was established on 15 May 1989 following the nuclear accident at Chernobyl (Ukraine). After the accident, nuclear operators worldwide began to work together through WANO to improve safety, reliability and prevent recurrences. Experience shows that many accidents could have been prevented if lessons had been learned from previous incidents. WANO unites every company and country that has an operating commercial nuclear power plant to achieve the highest possible standards of nuclear safety and reliability. The organisation enables members to provide mutual support, exchange safety knowledge and operating experience, and share best practices with each other to improve performance. WANO‚Äôs members operate approximately 460 nuclear units in over 30 countries and areas worldwide. WANO helps members communicate effectively and share information openly through its five main programmes: Peer Review, Performance Analysis, Member Support, Training & Development and Corporate Communications. It is not a regulatory or advisory body, or a lobbyist for the industry. WANO has offices in London and Shanghai, and regional centres in Atlanta, Moscow, Paris and Tokyo.  Mission  WANO‚Äôs mission is to maximise the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide by working together to assess, benchmark and improve performance through mutual support, exchange of information and emulation of best practice.  History  The tragic accident at the Chernobyl generating station in 1986 was both an end and a beginning for the nuclear industry. Faced with this reality, the leaders of every commercial nuclear reactor in the world set aside their competitive and regional differences and came together in 1989 to create the World Association of Nuclear Operators, or WANO. WANO's inaugural meeting was held in Moscow on 15 May 1989. It was jointly hosted by Lord Walter Marshall of Goring, the chairman of Britain's largest utility, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), and Nikolai F Lukonin, the USSR's Minister of Atomic Energy. Around 140 delegates from 29 countries pledged their backing for the organisation and signed its new charter. Today, it supports more than 130 members who operate approximately 460 civil nuclear power reactors around the world. In 1990, WANO published its first WANO Good Practice on Plant Predictive Maintenance and the organisation begun its Performance Indicator (PI) programme to collect key performance data from members. WANO conducted its first Peer Review at Paks nuclear power plant in Hungary in 1992. Peer Reviews became an official WANO Programme the following year. WANO made Peer Reviews a member obligation in 2006, with every commercial nuclear power plant in the world having received at least one Peer Review by 2010. After the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011, WANO expanded its remit to help members improve safety and performance. WANO identified 12 key post-Fukushima projects to implement in more than 460 commercial power plants worldwide to enhance safety.  WANO Programmes  * The Peer Review programme provides a critical assessment of station performance by an experienced team of global industry peers against nuclear industry standards of excellence as defined by WANO Performance Objectives and Criteria. * The Performance Analysis programme collects, screens and analyses operating experience and performance data, providing members with lessons learnt and industry performance insight reports. Fundamental to its success is the willingness of WANO members to openly share operating experience and performance data for the benefit of nuclear operators worldwide. * The Member Support programme works with members to improve safety and reliability. Activities include member support missions; new unit assistance; principles, guidelines and good practices; and member support improvement. Together, they help members learn from the experiences of their peers. * The Training & Development programme provides assistance to WANO members through workshops, seminars and training. This includes new entrants as well as operating stations. Specific activities include workshops, seminars, training courses and leadership courses. * The Corporate Communications programme ensures WANO's mission, vision and activities are shared with all internal and external audiences, including WANO members, industry vendors, new entrants, nations considering adding nuclear to their energy mix, other interested parties and the media. A variety of channels are used to promote access to WANO products and services.

He is the current manager of Victorian State League Division 1 club Brimbank Stallions FC, with whom he achieved back-to-back promotions in 2017 and 2018. Playing career Club career Marth broke into the senior setup at National Soccer League club Sunshine George Cross FC. He spent four seasons with the Western-suburbs based club before moving to nearby fellow NSL club Melbourne Knights FC in 1989. In the 1990-91 season, he won the Minor Premiership with the Knights but lost the Grand Final to bitter rivals South Melbourne FC. With Melbourne Croatia, Marth would then collect two more Minor Premierships but lose two more Grand Finals, both to Adelaide City. In the 1994-95 season, Knights once more met Adelaide City in the Grand Final but this time would emerge victorious, with the by- then captain of the Knights Andrew Marth grabbing a goal in a 2-0 victory. Marth then repeated his feat from the 94-95 season in the 95-96 season when he would once again captain Knighs to an NSL title, this time beating Marconi Fairfield 2-1, Marth once more on the scoresheet. Marth was the Joe Marston medallist in the 1996 national league grand final. Marth left the Knights at the end of the 1997-98 season, taking up a lucrative offer from Carlton SC, expressing vexation with the Club's recruitment policy. After spending three season with Carlton, Marth then returned to the Knights. Carlton folded that year. After Vlado Vani≈° was sacked as the coach in 2001, Marth took over as player-coach to see out the season. Marth played his final game for Melbourne Knights at the end of the 2003-04 NSL season, taking on sister-club Sydney United at Knights Stadium. At the end of the match, Marth and Ruden, the two captains of their sides, were carried off the pitch side by side. The hard-man midfielder then went and spent a season with Fawkner Blues in the VPL and then closed out his career with two seasons in the VPL with Green Gully. International career Marth played 16 matches for Australia between 1991 and 2000. Coaching career When Paul Magdiƒá was sacked as coach of Melbourne Knights FC in mid-2012, the club decided to hire Andrew Marth, with fellow club legend Frank Juriƒá appointed as his assistant. Melbourne Knights, now playing in the VPL, went through a mini-revival after the appointment, escaping relegation by some distance but missing out on making the finals' series. In his first full season, Marth managed to take the Knights to the final series following a second place league finish. Unfortunately, Melbourne Knights lost to both Bentleigh Greens and South Melbourne and exited the finals series. After the 2013 season, Marth was inducted into the Melbourne Knights Hall of Fame. In 2014, Marth won the Dockerty Cup with the Knights, beating South Springvale in the final. Reaching the semi-final of the Dockerty Cup also took Knights to the inaugural FFA Cup, where they lost to Olympic FC in Queensland. In 2016 Marth became Melbourne Knights' longest-serving head coach. In May 2017 Marth was relieved of his duties as coach of the NPL Victoria club. After departing the Knights, Marth dropped four division to join Victorian State League Division 3 club Brimbank Stallions FC, with whom he managed back-to-back promotions in 2017 and 2018.

This was described by the French ophthalmologist Louis √âmile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked- eye observation of eye movement in the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non- invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record, and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through recordings of eye movement and event-related potential.  History  Until the second half of the 19th century, researchers had at their disposal three methods of investigating eye movement. The first, unaided observation, yielded only small amounts of data that would be considered unreliable by today's scientific standards. This lack of reliability arises from the fact that eye movement occurs frequently, rapidly, and over small angles, to the extent that it is impossible for an experimenter to perceive and record the data fully and accurately without technological assistance. The other method was self-observation, now considered to be of doubtful status in a scientific context. Despite this, some knowledge appears to have been produced from introspection and naked-eye observation. For example, Ibn al Haytham, a medical man in 11th-century Egypt, is reported to have written of reading in terms of a series of quick movements and to have realised that readers use peripheral as well as central vision.Heller (1988:39). Leonardo da Vinci: The eye has a central line and everything that reaches the eye through this central line can be seen distinctly. Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) may have been the first in Europe to recognize certain special optical qualities of the eye. He derived his insights partly through introspection but mainly through a process that could be described as optical modelling. Based on dissection of the human eye he made experiments with water-filled crystal balls. He wrote \\"The function of the human eye, ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different.\\"Leonardo da Vinci (1955), das Lebensbild eines Genies, Emil Vollmer Verlag, Wiesbaden Berlin. Dokumentation der Davinci Ausstellung in Mailand 1938, p. 430; cited in 'Hans- Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung ‚Äì vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude' [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception ‚Äì from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia St√§ubli Verlag Z√ºrich 2006 . His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the \\"line-of-sight\\", the optical line that ends at the fovea. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal vision (a more precise term for central vision) and peripheral vision. However, Leonardo did not know that the retina is the sensible layer, he still believed that the lens is the organ of vision. There appear to be no records of eye movement research until the early 19th century. At first, the chief concern was to describe the eye as a physiological and mechanical moving object, the most serious attempt being Hermann von Helmholtz's major work Handbook of physiological optics (1866). The physiological approach was gradually superseded by interest in the psychological aspects of visual input, in eye movement as a functional component of visual tasks. The subsequent decades saw more elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including a claim that meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters.Rayner, Pollatsek, & Alexander (2005). In 1879, the French ophthalmologist Louis √âmile Javal used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term saccades. In 1898, Erdmann & Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.  Early tracking technology  Eye tracking device is a tool created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of electromagnetic energy was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare was the first to use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying membrane and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually. In 1889, Edmund B. Delabarre invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a stylus with a direct mechanical connection to the cornea.Delabarre (1898). Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used from the end of the 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps. Mechanical systems suffered three serious disadvantages: questionable accuracy due to slippage of the physical connection, the considerable discomfort caused to participants by the direct mechanical connection (and consequently great difficulty in persuading people to participate), and issues of ecological validity, since participants' experience of reading in trials was significantly different from the normal reading experience. Despite these drawbacks, mechanical devices were used in eye movement research well into the 20th century. Attempts were soon made to overcome these problems. One solution was to use electromagnetic energy rather than a mechanical connection. In the \\"Dodge technique\\", a beam of light was directed at the cornea, focused by a system of lenses and then recorded on a moveable photographic plate. Erdmann & DodgeErdmann B & Dodge R (1898). used this technique to claim that there is little or no perception during saccades, a finding that was later confirmed by Utall & Smith using more sophisticated equipment. The photographic plate in the Dodge technique was soon replaced with a film camera, but was still plagued by problems of accuracy, due to the difficulty of keeping all parts of the equipment perfectly aligned throughout a trial and accurately compensating for the distortion caused by the diffractive qualities of photographic lenses. In addition, it was usually necessary to restrain a participant's head by using an uncomfortable bite-bar or head-clamp. In 1922, Schott pioneered a further advance called electro- oculography (EOG), a method of recording the electrical potential between the cornea and the retina.Schott E (1922). Electrodes may be covered with special contact paste before being placed on the skin. So, it is now unnecessary to make incisions in patient's skin. Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the electromyogram of extraocular muscles. In fact, it is only the projection of eye dipole to the skin, because higher frequencies, corresponding to EMG, are filtered out. EOG delivered considerable improvements in accuracy and reliability, which explain its continued use by experimentalists for many decades.Finocchio, Preston, & Fuchs (1990).Liu, Zhou, Hu (2011).Tecce, Pok, Consiglio, O'Neil (2005).  Modern eye tracking  Four major cognitive systems are involved in eye movement during reading: language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control. Eye trackers bounce near infrared light off the interior of the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location. With this technique, the position of a fixation on a screen can be precisely determined.Wang (2011). Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects‚Äîrecording pupil dilation and eye movement‚Äîcan be used to examine how fixations, saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices. According to Wang (2011:185), \\"understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load.\\"  Saccades  Horizontal eye movement in reading. Left-to-right movement may be seen as \\"upstairs\\", and right-to-left saccades are clear. Skilled readers move their eyes during reading on the average of every quarter of a second. During the time that the eye is fixated, new information is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200‚Äì250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms.Sereno & Rayner (2003). The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7‚Äì9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20‚Äì40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired.Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, & Seidenberg (2001). There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions.Rayner, Slattery, Belanger (2010). These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of cognitive processing during reading.Rayner K (1975). acuity of foveal vision in reading The lower line of text simulates the acuity of vision with the relative acuity percentages. The difficulty of recognizing text increases with the distance from the fixation point.Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung ‚Äì vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception ‚Äì from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia St√§ubli Verlag Z√ºrich 2006, .  Dyslexia  People with dyslexia generally suffer from a decreased reading speed, which can be caused by many different variables. There are many remedies to try to combat these deficits, depending on what biological theory of dyslexia they are based on. One such idea is based on magnocellular deficit, where magnocellular pathways are uncoordinated, causing the skipping or re-reading of lines.Stein J., The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia Dyslexia. 2001 Jan‚ÄìMar;7(1):12‚Äì36.  Computer models of eye movement in reading  Competition‚Äìinteraction theory and SERIF emphasise low level oculomotor processes in reading such as how the word length of the currently fixated word and its neighbour words affect saccade amplitude and latency (or fixation duration). Reader, EMMA, E-Z Reader and SWIFT emphasise higher level cognitive processes such as lexical processing, word frequency, word parsing or word predictability.

The essence of Zazzo's research related to child psychology. He was one of the first people to study a group of problems relating to dyslexia and disability. Considering the development of children considered to be weak, Zazzo proposed the concept of \\"oligophrenic heterochrony\\" in order to show that this development, compared with that of normal children, occurred at various speeds, according to the particular psychobiological sector concerned. The majority of research which Zazzo produced between 1950 and 1980 centered on what he regarded as \\"the principal problem of psychology\\"‚Äîthat of the identity: how does a person's psyche build itself? The fields in which he worked were various attempts to bring answers to this question. Biography Zazzo was born in Paris into a modest family. After obtaining a Doctorate of Letters in the Sorbonne (1933-1933), on the advice of Meyerson and of Henri Wallon, he obtained a grant to study in the laboratory of Gesell at Yale University, where he specialized in child psychology. On his return to France, Zazzo began working for the CNRS and integrated the laboratory of Child Psychobiology and the Practical School of the Higher Studies. When the Germans invaded Paris during World War II, he directed the laboratory of psychopathology of the Henri Rousselle Hospital. He published his first book during the War, which was devoted to a study of the pioneers of American psychology (1942), before entering the French Resistance. In 1945, Zazzo was asked to found the first programs of school psychology. Zazzo wished to aid children who were not succeeding in school, as opposed to detecting children with psychological problems. In 1950, Zazzo taught at the same time at the Institute of Psychology, the National Institute for the Vocational guidance, and the laboratory of EPHE, where he succeeded Wallon, before becoming president of the French Company of Psychology in 1955 and in 1977. In 1967 he occupied the presidency of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Psychologie, and in 1968 he was appointed president of the Groupement Fran√ßais d'√âtudes de Neuro- Psychopathologie Infantile.

Names As was customary with many tribal names in the Murray basin ‚Äì Wemba-Wemba, Latjilatji, Muthi Muthi, Nari-Nari and so on ‚Äì the Yorta ethnonym is derived from reduplicating their word for \\"no\\" (yota/yoda). Norman Tindale (1974) listed the following alternative names used to refer to Yorta Yorta people: * Arramouro * Echuca tribe (used of Yorta Yorta clans south of the Murray) * Gunbowerooranditchgoole * Gunbowers (toponym, now Gunbower) * Loddon tribe * Moira (toponym) * Ngarrimouro,Ngarrimowro * Wollithiga * Woollathura * Yoorta (also an exonym for some clans of the Bangerang tribe) * Yotayota Language The Yorta Yorta language may be a language isolate within the Pama-Nyungan language family, though it is often treated as a member of the Yotayotic branch of that family along with Yabula Yabula, which is not particularly close. It is a dialect continuum of closely related languages traditionally spoken on either side of the Murray River from west of Echuca to east of the Cobram/Tocumwal area, and south-east along the Goulburn River as far as the Mooroopna/Shepparton. It was a first language for many of these groups down to around 1960 but elements of the language are still transmitted in families by descendants to this day. It shares few similarities in vocabulary with the languages used by neighbouring tribes, and lexically seems closest to Pallanganmiddang. Social organisation The Yorta Yorta were divided into clans, of which the names of ten were enumerated by Edward Micklethwaite Curr based on the situation in the 1840s:- * WongƒÅtpan. (150 persons) * T≈çwroonbanƒÅ. (50 persons) * Wollƒ´thiga. (50 persons) * Kaƒ´ilthiban.(50 persons) * Moƒ´theriban. (300 persons) * PikkolƒÅtpan. (100 persons) * Ang≈ç≈çtheriban. (100 persons) * Ngarrim≈çwro. (100 persons) * ToolenyƒÅgan. (100 persons) * BoongƒÅtpan Tindale (1974) named only three: * Gunbowerooranditchgoole.{{efn|-goole represents kuli, meaning \\"man\\". * Ngarrimouro * Woollathura Another source mentions \\"Dhulinyagan\\". The numbers may well estimate the historic population, since evidence from oven mounds in the area suggested a higher population density in former times, and it is known that the area was ravaged by smallpox epidemics. In modern times, the Yorta Yorta comprise a number of historically distinct tribes, as well as clans and family groups descending directly from the original Yorta Yorta. Tribes that now come under the general umbrella term of Yorta Yorta include the Bangerang and Kwatkwat. Clans groups represented include the Kailtheban, Wollithiga, Moira, Ulupna, Yalaba Yalaba, and Ngurai-illiam-wurrung. 1995 Native title claim In a Native title claim submitted in 1995 by the Yorta Yorta people, it was determined by Justice Olney in 1998 that the \\"tide of history\\" had \\"washed away\\" any real acknowledgement of traditional laws and any real observance of traditional customs by the applicants. An appeal was made to the full bench of the Federal Court on the grounds that \\"the trial judge erroneously adopted a 'frozen in time' approach\\" and \\"failed to give sufficient recognition to the capacity of traditional laws and customs to adapt to changed circumstances\\". The Appeal was dismissed in a majority 2 to 1 decision. The case was taken on appeal to the High Court of Australia but also dismissed in a 5 to 2 majority ruling in December 2002. In response to the failed native title claim, in May 2004 the Victorian State Government led by Premier Steve Bracks signed an historic co-operative management agreement with the Yorta Yorta people covering public land, rivers and lakes in north-central Victoria. The agreement gives the Yorta Yorta people a say in the management of traditional country including the Barmah State Park, Barmah State Forest, Kow Swamp and public land along the Murray and Goulburn rivers. Ultimate decision making responsibility was retained by the Environment Minister. Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation The Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation (YYNAC), established in 1999 and not to be confused with the former Yorta Yorta Local Aboriginal Land Council which took ownership of Cummeragunja Reserve in NSW in 1984, has its headquarters in Barmah and a branch office in Shepparton. YYNAC is governed by a board of seven directors, one of whom is an Elder‚Äôs representative, and a Council of Elders comprising 16 Yorta Yorta family group representatives. There is a CEO who manages the day-to-day operations, administration and personnel. History The Aborigines Advancement League (AAL) was established in the 1930s by Yorta Yorta activists such as William Cooper, Sir Douglas Nicholls, Marj Tucker, Geraldine Briggs and Shadrach James. It lodged a claim for the Barmah Forest in 1975 which was rejected by the Victorian Government. The Yorta Yorta Tribal Council (YYTC), formally established in April 1983, but according to some accounts originally established in 1972 by Elizabeth Maud Hoffman, Margaret Wirrpanda and others, took over the work of the AAL in working for the Yorta Yorta people. Among the founders were It made another claim for the Barmah Forest in 1984 under the Cain government, which did not succeed. The Yorta Yorta Tribal Council was superseded by the Yorta Yorta Clans Group (YYCG) in 1989, which broadened its scope and encompassed a wider geographic area of traditional Yorta Yorta land. YYCG was superseded by the YYNAC in 1999. TOSA land settlement In October 2010, the State entered into a Traditional Owner Land Management Agreement with the Yorta Yorta, which established the Yorta Yorta Traditional Owner Land Management Board to jointly manage Barmah National Park (a \\"TOSA\\" settlement, under the Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (Stated here.)). The Yorta Yorta Traditional Owner Land Management Board is a unit of YYNAC. As recognised traditional owners of the land, a joint management plan is being agreed between the YYNAC and the State of Victoria. Parks Victoria, as designated manager of Barmah National Park, will have responsibility for implementing many of the plan‚Äôs strategies and actions, working in partnership with the YYNAC and other partners such as the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DWLWP).

Music Indigenous pop singer Jessica Mauboy performs \\"Ngarra Burra Ferra\\" at the 2013 Mbantua Festival in Alice Springs, with Aboriginal Australian students from Yipirinya State Primary School, of which Mauboy is the official ambassador. The track \\"Ngarra Burra Ferra\\" sung by indigenous artist Jessica Mauboy, from the 2012 hit film The Sapphires, is a song based on the traditional Aboriginal hymn \\"Bura Fera\\". The song is in the Yorta Yorta language and speaks of God's help in decimating Pharaoh's armies. The chorus, \\"Ngara burra ferra yumini yala yala\\", translates into English as \\"The Lord God drowned all Pharaoh's armies, hallelujah!\\" These lyrics are based on an ancient song in Jewish tradition known as the \\"Song of the Sea\\" from the Book of Exodus. Aboriginal communities of Victoria and southern New South Wales may be the only people in the world who still sing the piece (in Yorta Yorta).

An example of a living document is an article in Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that permits anyone to freely edit its articles, in contrast to \\"dead\\" or \\"static\\" documents, such as an article in a single edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, or the U.S. Constitution, a document that can be amended. A living document may or may not have a framework for updates, changes, or adjustments. This type of document without proper context can change away from its original purpose through multiple uncontrolled edits. This can encourage open collaboration within the network, but in some cases there can also be stagnation if no one takes on the initiative of updating the work. One reason why initiative is not taken to update the document could come from a sense of ambiguity. However, a living document may evolve through successive updates, be expanded as needed, and serve a different purpose over time. Living documents are changed through revisions that may or may not reference previous iterative changes. The rate of document drift depends on the structure of the original document, or original intent of such document, or guidelines for modifying such document. In law Canada In Canadian law, this concept is called the \\"living tree doctrine\\" (French: th√©orie de l'arbre vivant). The 1929 case Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), which decided upon the right of women to sit in the Canadian Senate, was the first to establish this principle. The case was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, whereupon Viscount Sankey wrote of the ruling: > The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of > growth and expansion within its natural limits. The object of the Act was to > grant a Constitution to Canada. Like all written constitutions it has been > subject to development through usage and convention... > Their Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this Board‚Äîit is > certainly not their desire‚Äîto cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow > and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal > interpretation so that the Dominion to a great extent, but within certain > fixed limits, may be mistress in her own house, as the provinces to a great > extent, but within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in theirs.Reference > to Meaning of Word \\"Persons\\" in Section 24 of British North America Act, > 1867. (Judicial Committee of The Privy Council). Edwards v. A.G. of Canada > [1930] A.C. 124 . Human Rights in Canada: A Historical Perspective. From this the approach was born what became known as the living tree doctrine which requires \\"large and liberal\\" interpretation, declaring a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times. The living tree principle was again expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Re: Same-Sex Marriage (2004), when it held that Parliament (as opposed to provincial legislatures) had the power to define marriage as including same-sex unions. It rejected claims that the constitutionally enumerated federal authority in matters of \\"Marriage and Divorce\\" could not include same-sex marriage because marriage as conceived in 1867 was necessarily opposite-sex: United States In United States constitutional law, the Living Constitution view, also known as loose constructionism, permits the Constitution as a static document to have an interpretation that shifts over time as the cultural context changes. The opposing view, originalism, holds that the original intent or meaning of the writers of the Constitution should guide its interpretation. In business In business, a living document may fall under corporate change management or be shared among a team. It may start as a draft that at some time graduates into general acceptance, or may originate as part of a formal documentation process. Regardless of the degree of formality, a living document needs rules or guidelines for its modification. Such guidelines allow‚Äîand should ideally encourage‚Äîthe document's evolution over time. It is in this sense of growth that the document can be thought of as \\"living.\\" In technology In technology, living documents can be implemented using a wiki. Other common living document tools are Google Docs, Nextcloud Collabora, etc. Living documents can also be implemented by using test tools such as \\"HipTest\\" Living documentation is a key concept in specification by example.

He was born in Charlesbourg in 1762, descended from French ancestors who had first arrived in New France before 1660. He studied at the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, articled in law and was called to the bar in 1790. In 1792, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Northumberland; he was reelected in 1796, 1800 and 1804. In 1796, he married Luce, the daughter of a surgeon, Fran√ßois Lajus. B√©dard became leader of the parti canadien. He was one of the founders of the newspaper Le Canadien, which presented the party's views in print, in 1806. In 1808, he was elected in the Lower Town of Quebec and was reelected in 1809. B√©dard saw the legislative assembly as the only government body that represented the people of Lower Canada and so he resented the unchecked power wielded by the appointed councils and government ministers; he felt that ministers should be held accountable to the assembly. He also believed that judges should be kept independent from politics and so should not be allowed to sit in the legislative assembly. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1810 on the orders of Governor James Henry Craig for treasonable activities because of his association with Le Canadien; he was released in March the following year. B√©dard represented Surrey in the legislative assembly from 1810 to 1812, when he was named a judge in the Court of King's Bench for Trois-Rivi√®res district. In 1811, James Stuart replaced B√©dard as leader of the Parti canadien. During the War of 1812, B√©dard served as a captain in the militia. He opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada and led the opposition to the union in the Trois-Rivi√®res region. He died in Trois-Rivi√®res in 1829. His son Elz√©ar was a member in the legislative assembly, a judge and a mayor of Quebec City. His son Joseph-Isidore also served in the assembly. His brother Joseph was a member of the legislative assembly.

The program is known for its educational content, and pop music appeal, with the cast of the show known collectively as Hi-5. The series premiered on February 24, 2003. The program was nominated for three Emmy Awards. Format Hi-5 is a variety- style series for preschoolers which features music as an integral part of its premise. The program features five presenters who are collectively known as Hi-5, and perform songs as a group as well as presenting individual segments.

It was the eighth staging of the competition since the 1994 competition. The competition was the first of 34 Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments in the 2001 season. The tournament was broadcast on Sky Sports and was sponsored by Skol. Phil Taylor, the tournament's defending champion, whitewashed the competition's first non-British finalist John Part 7‚Äì0 in the final. It was Taylor's seventh consecutive championship and his ninth overall since his first success in the 1990 BDO world championship. He defeated Nigel Justice, Les Fitton, Keith Deller and Dave Askew en route to the final. Taylor achieved the competition's highest checkout of 167 in the third set of the final against Part. Tournament summary Background The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was established under the World Darts Council name by the managers John Markovic, Tommy Cox and Dick Allix and the world's top 16 players in January 1992 as a separate body from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The first edition of the PDC World Darts Championship was the 1994 competition; it is one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the BDO World Darts Championship. The 2001 tournament was held between 28 December 2000 and 3 January 2001 in Purfleet, Essex, England, and was the first of 34 PDC-sanctioned events that year. It was the eighth edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Circus Tavern. The Circus Tavern, where the tournament was held 32 players automatically qualified for the main draw with eight of them seeded. Peter Manley was seeded first and Alan Warriner was the second seed. Seven players debuted at the world championship; three were required by a tomlin order not to enter any PDC-sanctioned darts competitions for one year. They were Richie Burnett, Roland Scholten and Denis Ovens. Dave Askew, Les Fitton and Gary Spedding were the other three men to qualify for the event. The tournament featured the first woman, Gayl King, to play in a PDC world championship after the organisation invited her to take part. The maximum number of sets contested in a match increased from five in the first and second rounds to seven in the quarter-finals and eleven in the semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-thirteen sets. Sponsored by Skol, it had a total prize fund of ¬£125,000, and the host broadcaster was Sky Sports. Bookmakers and the press considered the tournament's defending champion Phil Taylor the favourite to retain his title for the seventh successive year. The second favourite to claim the world championship was Shayne Burgess after he was the runner-up in the World Grand Prix two months prior. Taylor expressed confidence he could compile a nine-dart finish after having done so in an exhibition match against Warriner. Round 1 The draw for the first round of the championship was made on Sky Sports' website by Tommy Cox, Alex Roy and Sid Waddell on the afternoon of 7 December 2000. The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 28 and 29 December 2000. In this round, eighth seed Askew defeated Mick Manning 3‚Äì2. Askew had attempted a nine-dart finish before he missed the triple 19 ring in the third leg of the opening set. Ahead 2‚Äì0, Askew lost his advantage when Manning won two sets in a row. The match ended with a sudden death leg in the fifth set that Askew took with a finish of thirteen darts to requite his loss from the World Grand Prix. Askew was the first player to enter the second round. Roy beat Steve Raw 3‚Äì2; the match saw Roy claim two successive sets until Raw won the next two to require a deciding fifth set that Roy took after five legs. The 1995 BDO world champion Burnett had a 34.46 average en route to whitewashing Steve Brown 3‚Äì0. Fitton took a 3‚Äì1 victory against Ovens. Manley, the world number one, was the highest ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 2‚Äì3 to world number 21 Jamie Harvey. His opponent won five legs for the first two sets before Manley took two sets 3‚Äì1. Harvey took the concluding set 3‚Äì1 to win. After the match Manley attributed his loss to Harvey's slow play and accuracy on hitting the double rings. John Lowe, a former world champion, defeated Spedding 3‚Äì1 after his opponent failed to win the third and fourth sets. Fifth seed Dennis Priestley lost 3‚Äì2 against Keith Deller. The first two sets were won by Deller. Priestley won the next two to force a final set decider that Deller won 6‚Äì4 on the bullseye ring. Taylor had an average of 31.36 points per dart thrown over Nigel Justice and had a 151 checkout in a 3‚Äì0 whitewash. Paul Lim averaged 29.83 points per dart and made checkouts of 110 and 128 to defeat Dan Lauby 3‚Äì1.

Stoddart complimented King on her play and the latter said she enjoyed the atmosphere. Warriner and Cliff Lazarenko whitewashed Reg Harding and Scott Cummings respectively 3‚Äì0. Seventh seed John Part whitewashed Colin Lloyd 3‚Äì0. The 2000 tournament semi-finalist and world number eleven Dennis Smith won the first set 3‚Äì2 over the pre-match favourite Peter Evison. He took the next two sets unchallenged to win 3‚Äì0. Bob Anderson, the 1988 BDO world champion, lost 1‚Äì3 to the sixth seed and two time World Matchplay champion Rod Harrington. Anderson went two sets behind Harrington after the first seven legs. He scored highly in the third set to go 2‚Äì1 behind before Harrington compiled a 119 checkout with a finish on the double 16 ring to win 3‚Äì1. In the final first round match, Roland Scholten whitewashed Burgess 3‚Äì0 and reached the second round of a PDC tournament for the first time in two prior attempts. Round 2 The second round was held on 30 December 2000. Askew took a 3‚Äì2 victory over Roy, a match that saw both players compile thirteen maximum scores between them. He converted a 2‚Äì1 deficit to win the match after he took the final two sets. Askew said afterwards: \\"I was really pleased to battle back. Alex is a great player but I'm just pleased that I've won.\\" Warriner defeated Lim 3‚Äì2 in a game where both players had sub-par performances; Warriner secured the opening two sets before Lim took the third and fourth sets to require the match to conclude with a fifth set due to the scores being tied at 2‚Äì2. Lim missed two opportunities to win the match and Warriner took the final set 5‚Äì3. In the match between Smith and Part, both players shared the first four sets to force a game-ending fifth set. Smith took the first leg before Part won three successive legs to win 3‚Äì2. Scholten whitewashed Lazarenko 3‚Äì0 from set victories of 3‚Äì2, 3‚Äì2 and 3‚Äì0. Harvey averaged a 60 per cent finishing record to whitewash Lowe 3‚Äì0 and compiled a series of maximums; Lowe was unable to convert multiple opportunities provided to him and prolong the game. Deller continued his run in the competition as he edged out Burnett 3‚Äì2. Both players tied at 2‚Äì2 to force a final set decider that Deller won with a 144 checkout. Taylor lost the first set of his match against world number 26 Fitton 3‚Äì2 before he secured three consecutive sets and a 3‚Äì1 victory with an average of 32.32 points per dart. Taylor said afterwards he was concerned about being eliminated from the tournament. The final match of the second round saw Harrington whitewash Stoddart 3‚Äì0 and earn the final berth in the quarter-finals. Harrington did not lose a leg to Stoddart as he won set one. He clinched the second after a final leg decider and then completed the match in set three 3‚Äì1. Quarter-finals The four quarter-finals were played to the best-of-seven sets on 1 January 2001. Askew produced a three-dart average finish close to 100 and achieved three maximums to win the first set from Harvey. He then compiled a 161 checkout and three maximums as he took the next three sets to whitewash Harvey 4‚Äì0 and was the first player to reach the semi- finals. Askew said him not partaking in celebrations for the start of 2001 allowed for his victory: \\"Jamie could have pushed me a lot harder. He didn't play as well as he could.\\" The second quarter-final saw Harrington beat Scholten 4‚Äì2. Harrington took the first set without losing a leg and had a 116 checkout. Scholten took the lead with victories in the following two sets. Harrington made three maximums to level the match after Scholten's dart did not land in the double 16 ring. Harrington then made a 12-dart finish in set five and won the match in the following set. He commented on his victory: \\"I really worked hard there. That was a good win and I'm feeling good. I could have gone in the ring with Mike Tyson and I think I would have given a good account of myself because that's how I felt. I was really pumped up.\\" In the third quarter-final, Part defeated Warriner 4‚Äì1. The match was tied after two sets before Part took a 2‚Äì1 advantage. In the second leg of the fifth set, Part could not complete a nine-dart finish. He then compiled a 69 checkout in thirteen dart throws. Part claimed set five 3‚Äì0 and became the third player to progress to the semi-finals. The last quarter-final saw Deller whitewashed 4‚Äì0 by Taylor and the latter increased his unbeaten televised game streak to 21. He attained a three-dart finishing average of 103.19 and took the opening leg 3‚Äì0. He missed hitting the doubles and caused the second set to conclude after five legs. Taylor achieved a 120 checkout in the third set and a finish of ten darts in the fourth set to win the match. Taylor said his performance had improved and that Deller did not play to the best of his ability: \\"He's a professional darts player so you've got to knock his confidence down a bit because otherwise he can get in front and his confidence goes up.\\" Semi- finals Both of the semi-finals were played to the best-of-eleven frames on 2 January 2001. Taylor whitewashed Askew 6‚Äì0 with a three-dart finish average of almost 103 and compiled 14 maximums. Taylor won the first four sets and Askew commenced the fifth with a 126 checkout. Taylor then claimed six consecutive legs including an 11-dart finish to win. After the match, Taylor said he felt he could improve his throw because it was out of trajectory and that he had put pressure onto Askew from the beginning of the game. He was considered the favourite to win the title the following day and commented that wanted to claim his ninth world championship, \\"I want to be ten times world champion. This is the biggest chance I've got to make it nine and I can't see anybody beating me. Certainly not tomorrow.\\" The other semi-final was contested between Harrington and Part. Both players shared the first two sets before Part extended his lead to 3‚Äì1 after he won the fourth set. A finish of eleven darts and misses from Part allowed Harrington to take set five before Part won the following two sets. Harrington then took three more sets to require the match to conclude in a final-set decider. The first leg saw Part win with a 122 checkout before he missed the double 16 ring in the third leg. Harrington tied the set at 2‚Äì2 on the double 20 ring. This required a player to win the match in a tiebreak. Part achieved checkouts of 161 and 86 to claim a 6‚Äì5 win. This made Part the first non-British player to reach the final of the PDC world championship. Part said post-match that he \\"was almost crying, I really was. I knew Rod was the quality player he is and that I couldn't let him back the way I did. I think I'm really fortunate that I got out of that.\\" Final Phil Taylor (pictured in 2009) won his ninth world darts championship with a 7‚Äì0 whitewash of Part. The final between Part and Taylor on 3 January 2001 was held to the best-of-thirteen sets. To reach the 2001 final, Taylor had defeated Nigel Justice, Les Fitton, Keith Deller and Dave Askew, while Part had beaten Colin Lloyd, Dennis Smith, Alan Warriner and Rod Harrington. This was Taylor's tenth world championship final and his eighth consecutive in the PDC. He had previously won the world championship eight times in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Part had been the BDO world champion in 1994 and appeared in his second career world final. It was the first time Taylor and Part had played each other in professional competition. The game was attended by 1,000 people. Taylor won the first two legs and Part threw 12 darts to win the third with a 127 checkout. He won the first set 3‚Äì1 with a 14-dart finish. Taylor then took the second set with a 121 checkout and stopped Part from getting a chance to hit a double ring. In set three, Taylor compiled the tournament's highest checkout, a 167, in its second leg and won the set after Part missed the bullseye ring in the first leg. He then won six successive legs to go 5‚Äì0 ahead with a finish of ten dart throws and an 82 checkout. Part took the first leg of the sixth set with a 120 checkout to stop a loss of 14 legs in a row before Taylor complied three consecutive 13-dart finishes to claim the set 3‚Äì1. The seventh set began with Part claiming one leg until Taylor completed a 7‚Äì0 whitewash by winning the set 3‚Äì1 and the tournament. It was Taylor's ninth world darts championship and his seventh in succession. He had a 72.4 per cent checkout and a three-dart average of 107.46. Taylor earned ¬£33,000 for winning the tournament and ¬£1,000 for compiling the highest checkout. He commented on his win: \\"I must admit that I did think John would have given me more of a push but I didn't give him a chance to be fair. My finishing was superb tonight. But you can't give him a chance because otherwise you'll be runner-up.\\" Taylor also stated his belief the result was similar to his defeat of Dennis Priestley at the 1998 tournament. Part said Taylor had defeated him meticulously. \\"Playing Phil is completely oppressive, take Tiger Woods and double it, He really killed me with his outshots, his doubles percentage must have been around 80 per cent, which is ridiculous. It takes away your hope when a guy never misses a double. It was a special performance, unreal, and I just couldn't measure up.\\", stated Part.

He is also notable for being one of the first non-British or Irish players to play in the Scottish leagues. Playing career Born in Cairo, Egypt, Mansour played for Cairo-based club Al Ahly in his native country, where his performances earned him a selection for the 1934 World Cup in Italy. He played in Egypt's only game at the tournament, a 4‚Äì2 defeat to Hungary in the first round in Naples. Mansour also played for Egypt at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Egypt's coach at the World Cup had been a Scotsman, James McRea, and he may have influenced Mansour's decision to move to Scotland in 1936 to attend Jordanhill College alongside Mohamed Latif. While studying in Glasgow, Mansour appeared for the famous amateur side Queens Park, becoming their regular goalkeeper upon the retirement of future Celtic chairman Desmond White during the 1938‚Äì39 season. Coaching career and later life In the late thirties, \\"Tuffy\\" Mansour as he was known, was a popular adult leader in the 72nd Glasgow Scout Troop. Mansour returned to Egypt when the Second World War broke out, where he would later manage former club Al Ahly, as well as become a government minister. He died in July 2002, a month before what would have been his 88th birthday.

Milan or simply Milan (), an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Foundation and early years The AC Milan team of 1907. A.C. Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriates Alfred Edwards and Herbert Kilpin. The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date, but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days earlier, most likely on 13 December. However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate. Edwards, a former British vice-consul in Milan and well-known personality of the Milanese high society, was the club's first elected president. Initially, the team included a cricket section, managed by Edward Berra, and a football section, managed by Kilpin. The official colours chosen were red and black. Immediately the team gained relevant notability under Kilpin's guide. The first trophy to be won was the Medaglia del Re (King's Medal) in January 1900, and the team later won three national leagues, in 1901, 1906 and 1907. The triumph of 1901 was particularly relevant because it ended the consecutive series of wins of Genoa, which had been the only team to have won prior to 1901. In 1908, issues over the signing of foreign players led to a split and the formation of F.C. Internazionale Milano. 1910‚Äì1949 In 1916, Milan won the Federal Cup, a national trophy which had replaced the Italian league, suspended because of World War I. This cup was never recognized as an Italian title. In 1919, the team changed its name to Milan Football Club. After their first triumphs, Milan was unable to continue with their former high-level success, obtaining only a number of half-table placements, even if always playing in the top Italian division. In 1939, the fascist regime imposed a new italianized name, Associazione Calcio Milano, for the team. However, that name was partly abandoned after World War II, but maintaining the initial part: the team was called Associazione Calcio Milan, which remains the club's current official name. 1950s Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. Perhaps the most resounding victory of this period was the 7‚Äì1 defeat of Juventus in Turin on 5 February 1950, with Gunnar Nordahl scoring a hat-trick. In the post-war period, Milan was among the three top Italian teams, and won the Scudetto in 1951, the first time since 1907. Il Grande Milan included the famous \\"Gre-No-Li\\", a trio of Swedish players composed by Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm, all previous Olympic winners. That team also fielded quality players such as Lorenzo Buffon, Cesare Maldini and Carlo Annovazzi. B√©la Guttmann was appointed manager of A.C. Milan in 1953. Guttmann had them top of Serie A 19 games into his second season in charge when a string of disputes with the board led to his dismissal. He later told a stunned press conference \\"I have been sacked even though I am neither a criminal nor a homosexual. Goodbye.\\" From then on he insisted on a clause in his contract that he could not be sacked if his team were top of the table.Contested Fields; A Global History of Modern Football Milan won Serie A seasons in 1955, 1957 and 1959, and two Latin Cups, in 1951 and 1956. Between the 1947‚Äì48 and 1956‚Äì57 seasons, Milan always finished amongst the top three clubs in the league table. 1960s {style=\\"float:right\\"  |} Milan returned to win a football league in 1961‚Äì62 under manager Nereo Rocco, an innovative football coach known as the inventor of the catenaccio tactic. The team included a young Gianni Rivera and Jos√© Altafini. The following season, in large part due to Altafini's prolific goal- scoring, Milan won their first European Cup (later known as UEFA Champion League) by defeating Portugal's Benfica 2‚Äì1. This also marked the first time an Italian team won the European Cup. European Cup Winners' Cup final against German side Hamburger SV in 1968. Despite the successes of the decade's early years, Milan won fewer trophies throughout the 1960s, mainly because of the heavy competition of Helenio Herrera's Internazionale, Milan's city rivals. Its next Scudetto arrived only in 1967‚Äì68 through the offense output of Pierino Prati, the Serie A's top-scorer that season, as well as the European Cup Winners' Cup, won against Hamburger SV thanks to the two goals of Kurt Hamrin. In the next season, Milan won its second European Cup, 4‚Äì1 over Ajax, and in 1969 won its first Intercontinental Cup after defeating Argentina's Estudiantes La Plata in two dramatic legs (3‚Äì0, 1‚Äì2). 1970s In the 1970s, Milan won three Coppa Italia and its second Cup Winners' Cup during the 1972‚Äì73 season. Greek referee Christos Michas, who officiated the final, was later sentenced of match fixing in his home country, though no involvement by Milan was ever proved. The real goal of the Rossoneri was the tenth Scudetto, which would have awarded the first stella (\\"star\\") to the team. In 1972, they reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup, though falling to eventual Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur. A strong 1972‚Äì73 season provided their first opportunity for the tenth Scudetto, but ultimately proved a failure after a humiliating defeat against Hellas Verona on the last day of the season. Milan had to wait until 1978‚Äì79 to win their tenth Scudetto, primarily being led by Gianni Rivera, who retired from football after this final triumph. However, the worst was yet to come for the Rossoneri‚Äîafter the 1979‚Äì80 season, Milan was relegated to Serie B by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), together with Lazio, due to a betting scandal. 1980s Marco van Basten was part of the Dutch trio that brought glory back to Milan. In 1980‚Äì81, Milan handily won the Serie B championship, ensuring a swift return to Serie A, where it would suffer its worst season ever, in 1981‚Äì82, being relegated once again. After several different financial troubles had caused poor times and a lack of success on the pitch, Milan was bought on 20 February 1986 by Silvio Berlusconi, a Milanese entrepreneur. Berlusconi brought in a rising coach, Arrigo Sacchi, and three Dutch players, Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit, in an attempt to return the team to glory, along with the Italian stars Roberto Donadoni, Carlo Ancelotti and Giovanni Galli. Sacchi and Milan won the 1987‚Äì88 Scudetto after an impressive recovery over the Diego Maradona- led Napoli. The next season, in 1988‚Äì89, Milan won its third European Cup after defeating Steaua Bucure»ôti 4‚Äì0 in the final, and its second Intercontinental Cup against National de Medell√≠n (1‚Äì0, goal in the last minute of extra time). 1990s Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League Final. The team repeated their International Cup triumph the following season after defeating Benfica 1‚Äì0, then earned its second Intercontinental Cup in a row‚Äîand third overall‚Äîafter beating Olimpia Asunci√≥n in 1990. Their European-winning line-up was: Giovanni Galli; Mauro Tassotti, Alessandro Costacurta, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini; Angelo Colombo, Frank Rijkaard, Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni; Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten. During this period, the team was nicknamed Gli Immortali (\\"The Immortals\\"). With Sacchi leaving Milan to coach the Italy national team, Fabio Capello was hired and under him, the Rossoneri kept being successful and came to be known as Gli Invicibili (\\"The Invincibles\\"). With an unprecedented 58-match run with no defeats, the Invincibili boasted the likes of Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini as one of the strongest defences in football history, along with Marcel Desailly and Roberto Donadoni in midfield and Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá, Zvonimir Boban and Daniele Massaro in attack. In addition to three consecutive Scudetti from 1992 to 1994‚Äîincluding the feat going undefeated in 1991‚Äì92), Milan reached the Champions League final in three consecutive years, firstly in 1993, where they were defeated by Marseille, a result later disputed by a match-fixing scandal in the French Ligue 1 involving Marseille's then-club president. In 1994, however, Milan defeated Barcelona after a 4‚Äì0 win at the hands of the Rossoneri, while in 1995, Milan fell to Ajax; but they lost 2‚Äì0 against V√©lez Sarsfield in the Intercontinental Cup. Then, in 1995‚Äì96, led by stars Roberto Baggio, Marco Simone and George Weah, Milan earned its 15th Italian championship. Milan's primary line-up under Capello in the winning season was: Sebastiano Rossi; Christian Panucci, Alessandro Costacurta, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini; Roberto Donadoni, Demetrio Albertini, Marcel Desailly; Zvonimir Boban; George Weah, Roberto Baggio. ;1996‚Äì97 After the departure of Fabio Capello in 1996, Milan recruited the Uruguayan √ìscar Tab√°rez, but they struggled under the manager and were winless in their opening matches. In an attempt to regain former glories, the club brought back Arrigo Sacchi to replace Tab√°rez. The team then suffered their worst-ever Serie A defeat after being humiliated by Juventus at the San Siro, 1‚Äì6. Milan signed new players like Ibrahim Ba, Christophe Dugarry and Edgar Davids, though this did not stop Milan's struggles‚Äîthey finished the year 11th in Serie A. ;1997‚Äì98 Sacchi was replaced with the returning Fabio Capello in the following season, whose new Milan signed many potential players like Christian Ziege, Patrick Kluivert, Jesper Blomqvist and Leonardo. The acquisitions, however, did little to reverse the team's recent ill fortunes‚ÄîMilan still finished mid-table in tenth, prompting the termination of Capello. ;1998‚Äì99 In its search for a new manager, Alberto Zaccheroni attracted Milan's attention. Zaccheroni was the manager of Udinese who had ended the Season 1997‚Äì98 in third place. Milan signed Zaccheroni along with two of his players at Udinese, Oliver Bierhoff and Thomas Helveg. Milan also signed Roberto Ayala, Luigi Sala and Andres Guglielminpietro and with a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation, Zaccheroni brought the club's 16th Scudetto back to Milan. The winning line-up was: Christian Abbiati; Luigi Sala, Alessandro Costacurta, Paolo Maldini; Thomas Helveg, Demetrio Albertini, Massimo Ambrosini, Andres Guglielminpietro; Zvonimir Boban, George Weah, Oliver Bierhoff. ;1999‚Äì2000 Despite success in the previous season, Zaccheroni failed to transform Milan to the great team it used to be. The following season, despite the emergence of the Ukrainian Andriy Shevchenko, Milan disappointed their fans in both the Champions League and Serie A, exiting the former after winning just one out of six Group Stage matches and ending the domestic season third, never representing a realistic challenge to the top two of Lazio and Juventus. 2000s ;2000‚Äì2001 The following season, Milan qualified for the 2000‚Äì01 Champions League by defeating Dinamo Zagreb 6‚Äì1 on aggregate. Milan started the Champions League on a high note, defeating Be≈üikta≈ü from Turkey and Spanish giants Barcelona, who at the time consisted of international world- class superstars in Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert. But Milan's form began to seriously decline, drawing against a number of teams (which are seen as technically inferior to Milan), but mainly losing by a 3‚Äì0 scoreline to Juventus in Serie A and 1‚Äì0 to Leeds United. In the second round of the Champions League, Milan won once and drew four times. They failed to beat Deportivo de La Coru√±a in the last game and Zaccheroni was subsequently fired. Cesare Maldini, the father of team captain Paolo, was appointed and prospects immediately improved. Maldini's official coaching debut at Milan started with a 4‚Äì0 win over Bari, featuring a young Antonio Cassano. It was also under Maldini's leadership that Milan defeated their city rivals Inter with an outstanding score of 6‚Äì0, a score which has never been repeated and in which Serginho starred in the match. After this peak of form, however, Milan started losing again, including a disappointing 1‚Äì0 defeat to Vicenza, with the only goal in the match scored by a young Luca Toni. In spite of these results, the Milan board of directors were adamant that Milan reach fourth place in the league at the end of the season, but Maldini failed and the team ended sixth. ;2001‚Äì02 Milan began the 2001‚Äì02 campaign signing more star players, including Javi Moreno and Cosmin Contra, who both helped Alav√©s reach the 2001 UEFA Cup final. The team also signed Kakha Kaladze (from Dynamo Kyiv), Rui Costa (from Fiorentina), Filippo Inzaghi (from Juventus), Martin Laursen (from Hellas Verona), Jon Dahl Tomasson (from Feyenoord), √úmit Davala (from Galatasaray) and Andrea Pirlo (from rivals Inter). Replacing Cesare Maldini was Fatih Terim, who had moderate initial success with the team. After five months, however, Milan was far removed from the top five in the league, and Terim was subsequently sacked for failing to meet the board of directors' expectations. He was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti, despite rumours that Franco Baresi would be the new manager. Despite the injury problems of full-back Paolo Maldini, Ancelotti was successful and led Milan to a fourth-place finish, thus earning a place in the Champions League. Milan's starting line at that point was Christian Abbiati; Cosmin Contra, Alessandro Costacurta, Martin Laursen, Kakha Kaladze; Gennaro Gattuso, Demetrio Albertini, Serginho; Rui Costa; Andriy Shevchenko, Filippo Inzaghi. ;2002‚Äì03 (3rd in Serie A, Champions of Europe) Milan ended the season with their sixth Champions League trophy in 2003. En route to the final at Old Trafford, Manchester, Milan beat their cross city rivals Inter in the semi-finals and beat another other Italian rival, Juventus, in a dramatic penalty shoot-out. That same season, Milan placed third in Serie A and won both the Coppa Italia and UEFA Super Cup. The team's Champions League-winning starting line-up was: Dida; Alessandro Costacurta, Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini, Kakha Kaladze; Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf; Rui Costa; Andriy Shevchenko, Filippo Inzaghi. The following season, Milan signed Kak√°. The team earned the nickname \\"I Meravigliosi\\" (\\"The Amazings\\"). ;2003‚Äì04 (Champions in Serie-A, Quarter Finals in Champions League) Piazza del Duomo. Milan set a points record to win the Scudetto with a team that was largely kept constant for nearly five years‚Äîan attack spearheaded by striker Andriy Shevchenko, playmaking by Kak√° and defence by Alessandro Nesta and Paolo Maldini. Milan's season, however, was not perfect as they were beaten by Deportivo La Coru√±a 0‚Äì4 in the quarter-finals of the 2003‚Äì04 Champions League despite winning the first leg 4‚Äì1 at the San Siro. Despite being Italian champions, Milan showed, as some critics said, weak midfield character that would repeat itself in the Champions League final in the following season. Nevertheless, the squad proved successful and able to express a brilliant style of play for many months. ;2004‚Äì05 (2nd in Serie A, 2nd in Champions League) Hern√°n Crespo, on loan from Chelsea, proved to be a solid acquisition for Milan, while midfielder Massimo Ambrosini scored an incredible late goal against PSV. The season, however, ended in disastrous defeat in Istanbul's Atat√ºrk Stadium in the 2005 Champions League final. In the game, Milan relinquished a 3‚Äì0 half-time lead against Liverpool after conceding three goals in a span of just six minutes before ultimately losing 3‚Äì2 on penalties. Milan ended the season in second place to Juve in Serie A and Italian Super Cup champions over Lazio. ;2005‚Äì06 (3rd in Serie A, Semi Finals in Champions League) Milan's Serie A campaign appeared to be one of their most successful in recent years. The team ended the season with a league-high 28 wins, but could not edge Juventus in the standings due to their record-setting pace of 91 points, a record point total since broken. This success, however, was nullified by the Calciopoli scandal. Milan were named in the Serie A scandal of 2006 and deprived of 44 out of the 88 points they gained in the season. In addition, Milan would start their 2006‚Äì07 campaign with ‚Äì15 points. These point reductions, however, were later reduced to 30 and ‚Äì8 respectively, providing Milan the chance to compete in the 2006‚Äì07 Champions League. Milan's efforts in the Champions League that year also proved promising, though they ultimately fell short. After coming out on top of their group, Milan advanced to the knockout phase of the tournament, first defeating Bayern Munich on aggregate and then France's Lyon 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the semi-finals, they were eliminated by eventual champions Barcelona 0‚Äì1 on aggregate, where Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko had a goal controversially disallowed. ;2006‚Äì07 (4th in Serie A, Won UEFA Champions League) Milan's Serie A campaign began with an ‚àí8-point penalty resulting from the Calciopoli scandal. After a lackluster first half of the season that saw Milan hover in the middle of the standings, several January transfer acquisitions, including World Cup winner Massimo Oddo and Brazilian legend Ronaldo, reinvigorated the club. By the end of the campaign, Milan surged up the table to finish fourth, thus assuring their participation for the 2007‚Äì08 Champions League. While their Serie A campaign proved moderately successful, the 2006‚Äì07 season is best remembered for the team's performance in the Champions League. The penalties imposed after the Calciopoli scandal resulted in Milan being seeded third in the final 2005‚Äì06 Serie A table, thus the team was forced to play in the Champion's League Qualifiers, where they were matched-up against former European champion Red Star Belgrade. Milan were victorious in the qualifier and advanced to the group phase, which they would eventually win. Milan's starting lineup against Liverpool in Athens. Milan survived a first round fight, defeating Celtic (eventual champions of that year's Scottish Premier League) 1‚Äì0 on aggregate after an extra time goal by Kak√°. Milan would then go on to defeat Bayern Munich 4‚Äì2 on aggregate (2‚Äì2 at San Siro and 2‚Äì0 at Allianz Arena) to reach the semi-finals, marking the third consecutive, and fourth time in five years, that Milan has reached the final four of the competition. The first leg of the semi-final was played against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester scored early on a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, but Milan answered back through a brace from Kak√°, ensuring a 1‚Äì2 lead at half-time. United would ultimately prove victorious, however, due to two second-half goals from striker Wayne Rooney. This match was regarded by the media and UEFA President Michel Platini as the greatest match in recent memories. The second leg of the semi-final was played at San Siro on 2 May, where Milan played a near-perfect first-half, taking a 2‚Äì0 lead into the break with goals from Kak√° and Clarence Seedorf. A 78-minute goal by Alberto Gilardino sealed the victory for the home side. Milan advanced to the final, pitting them in a rematch against their 2005 finals opponent, Liverpool. The match was played at the Olympic Stadium in Athens on 23 May 2007 with Milan prevailing 2‚Äì1 with both goals coming from Filippo Inzaghi. With the victory, the club affirmed its status as one of European football's elite, with three Champions League final appearances in five years, including two victories. ;2007‚Äì08 (5th in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in Europe, Won FIFA Club World Cup) In the wake of a seventh European Cup/Champions League title, Milan continued their international success by winning the 2007 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla in a game marked with sadness over the recent on-field death of Sevilla player Antonio Puerta. Milan's Champions League success also made the club eligible to compete in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, where they would win their 18th officially recognized international trophy, tying them for most club international trophies in the world. Ironically, Milan won their 18th title in a match against Boca Juniors, the team they were tied for the record. These two trophies, however, only served as consolation for a disappointing season for Milan. The club had a slow start in Serie A, often finding it difficult to score after a pre-season injury to Ronaldo. This, coupled with their aging backline and some deteriorating performances by goalkeeper Dida, found the club sitting mid-table for the majority of the season, though new signing Alexandre Pato was a bright light for an otherwise dark season for Milan. By the end of the domestic campaign, Fiorentina edged Milan out for fourth place in the standings, knocking them out of qualification for the 2008‚Äì09 Champions League, the team's first failure to reach the tournament since 2001‚Äì02. Milan's involvement in the 2007‚Äì08 edition of the Champions League was also forgettable. While the club won its group, they were quickly eliminated by Arsenal in the first knockout round. Prior to this season, Milan had made it to at least the quarterfinals of every Champions League going back to the 2002‚Äì03 edition. ;2008‚Äì09 (3rd in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in UEFA Cup) After a poor domestic season the year prior, the club made numerous additions during the off-season, signing Ronaldinho from Barcelona and re-acquiring former star Andriy Shevchenko from Chelsea, in addition to adding Gianluca Zambrotta, Marco Borriello and Mathieu Flamini, amongst others. They also later added international sensation David Beckham during the January transfer window on loan from the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). Despite the high-profile additions, the season started poorly after two consecutive losses. The team bounced back, however, rising to first spot in the table for one week in the first half of the season before later dropping behind rivals Inter, who would go on to win their fourth-straight Serie A championship. The team also fared poorly in the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup competition. After winning their group and advancing to the knockout stage, the team was eliminated by eventual finalist Werder Bremen. Perhaps the most notable aspect of the 2008‚Äì09 season was the retirement of footballing legend Paolo Maldini, who played all of his professional club games for Milan in a career that spanned 25 years. ;2009‚Äì10 (3rd in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in Europe) The season started with the dismissal of the head coach Carlo Ancelotti and the hiring of his replacement, former Milan player Leonardo. During the transfer season, the club's major activity was the sale of Kak√° for a then-world record transfer fee of ‚Ç¨64.5 million to Real Madrid. The start of the season was poor, as the team failed to win several matches. But the results started to change in the victory against Roma, and the crucial victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium. The season included the resurgence of Ronaldinho, Marco Borriello and new players Luca Antonini and Ignazio Abate. Although the Rossoneri achieved some important results, they were eliminated from the Champions League by Manchester United and lost the Serie A race to Inter. At the end of the season, Leonardo resigned despite Milan's wishes to keep him in the position. 2010s ;2010‚Äì11 (1st in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in Europe) Following a season of relative disappointment, with regards to signings and results, club president Silvio Berlusconi reinforced Milan by signing Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá in a loan deal from Barcelona, Robinho from Manchester City for ‚Ç¨18 million and Kevin-Prince Boateng on loan from Genoa. Following the resignation of Leonardo, Milan appointed Massimiliano Allegri, previously head coach of Cagliari. Following a mixed start to the season (including a 4‚Äì0 win against Lecce, draws against Catania and Lazio, and a loss to Cesena), Milan began performing well and soon reached the top of the Serie A table from November onwards. The new signings of Ibrahimoviƒá and Robinho paid dividends; along with Pato, the three would score 19 goals between them (Ibrahimoviƒá, nine; Robinho, six; Pato, four) by the end of the 2010 calendar year. The defensive partnership of Alessandro Nesta and Thiago Silva in front of goalkeeper Christian Abbiati also gave Milan one of Serie A's top defences. By the end of 2010, and the beginning of 2011, Milan had faced an injury crisis that had seen players Andrea Pirlo, Massimo Ambrosini, Filippo Inzaghi, Gianluca Zambrotta, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Daniele Bonera, Luca Antonini, Alexandre Pato and Alessandro Nesta all injured. The team would then be enforced during the winter transfer period with the signings of Antonio Cassano, Mark van Bommel, Urby Emanuelson, D√≠dac Vil√† and Nicola Legrottaglie. The signing of Cassano had also paved way for the exit of Ronaldinho, who joined Rio de Janeiro-based side Flamengo in Brazil. Many of these signings, however, had already participated in the Champions League earlier in the season, meaning that they were cup-tied and thus unable to play for Milan the year's tournament. This, coupled with the numerous injuries, resulted in Milan's elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur in the first knockout round. In the league, however, Milan continued to put in strong performances, including convincing wins against Inter and Napoli, the league's other title-contenders. Following a 0‚Äì0 draw with Roma on 7 May, Milan mathematically claimed their 18th Scudetto. ;2012‚Äì13 (3rd in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in Europe) In the 2012‚Äì13 Champions League knockout round, Milan won their home leg 2‚Äì0 over Barcelona. This was unfortunately not enough as they were comprehensively beaten 4‚Äì0 in the return leg. A third-place league finish behind Juventus and Napoli secured a Champions League berth for the following season. ;2013‚Äì14 (8th in Serie A, Eliminated First Knockout Round in Europe) The 2013‚Äì14 Serie A season saw the return of club-icon Kaka, joining on a free transfer during the summer transfer window following a poor spell at Real Madrid. Despite this, Milan made a poor start to the season, that saw them lose four of their opening 10 matches, including an opening day loss to Hellas Verona. Following a 4‚Äì3 defeat away to Sassuolo that left the club in 11th place, Massimiliano Allegri was sacked and was replaced by another club icon, Clarence Seedorf. At the time, Seedorf was still playing at Brazilian side Botafogo, but terminated his contract to take up the managerial role. Despite overseeing Milan's first 5-match winning streak since 2011, as well as a win against city-rivals Inter, Seedorf was sacked as Milan finished in 8th. During the Dutchman's time at the helm of the club, Milan gained a total of 35 out of a possible 57 points - the fourth-most out of all Serie A sides (one less than Napoli's corresponding total and six less than Roma's). At a European level, Milan qualified for the group stages of the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Champions League following a 4-1 aggregate victory against PSV Eindhoven. After being drawn into the same group as Barcelona, Celtic and Ajax, Milan qualified second in their group, before being knocked out by Spanish-side Atl√©tico Madrid 5-1 on aggregate at the round of 16 stage. ;2014‚Äì15 (10th in Serie A) Milan hoped to turn around this run of bad fortune in the 2014‚Äì15 campaign under new boss Filippo Inzaghi. Convincing wins over Lazio (3‚Äì1) and Parma (5‚Äì4) at the beginning of the season seemed to display a change in performance, as Milan sat top of Serie A heading into October 2014. However, a deterioration in morale and what many had blamed on a lack of key signings doomed Milan to a tenth-placed finish. Club legend Inzaghi was subsequently sacked as head coach. ;2015‚Äì16 (7th in Serie A) A raft of change came prior to the 2015‚Äì16 campaign. Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá was recruited as head coach after he guided Sampdoria to a seventh- place finish the previous season. Club president Silvio Berlusconi splashed cash in order to bring a raft of talent into the club, including the signings of prolific Sevilla and Colombian international forward Carlos Bacca and 20-year-old Italian starlet Alessio Romagnoli from Roma for ‚Ç¨30 million each; Genoa midfielder Andrea Bertolacci was also added for ‚Ç¨20 million. The club went on a ten-game unbeaten run in December to February, a period in which the club peaked at fifth place in Serie A and which included a 2‚Äì0 win over Fiorentina and a 3‚Äì0 victory over Inter in the Derby della Madonnina. The Rossoneri also reached the final of the season's Coppa Italia, defeating third-tier giant-killers Alessandria in the semi-finals. A string of embarrassing results, such as a 3‚Äì3 draw at home with lowly Frosinone (in which they had to fight back from 3‚Äì1 down) and failure to overcome relegation-threatened Hellas Verona, saw the sacking of Mihajloviƒá as coach and the appointment of Cristian Brocchi for the remainder of the season. Unfortunately, this was not enough as Milan would see themselves leapfrogged by Sassuolo during the penultimate round of Serie A matches and finished in seventh, just outside the European spots. Hope remained, however, as defeating Juventus in the Coppa Italia final on 21 May would see them qualify for the Europa League. Milan ultimately lost the match 1‚Äì0 after extra time thanks to a late √Ålvaro Morata strike. ;2016‚Äì17 (6th in Serie A) At the beginning of the season, Vincenzo Montella was hired as the new manager. Montella managed to win the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana which was Milan's first trophy in 5 years as well as taking the club back to Europe after 3 years. ;2017‚Äì18 (6th in Serie A, Eliminated Round of 16 in Europa League) On 27 November 2017, Vincenzo Montella was sacked by Milan. Subsequently, they appointed Gattuso as the head coach of the first team, who left the position as the coach of A.C. Milan Primavera. Gennaro Gattuso recorded his first win as A.C. Milan head coach with a 2‚Äì1 home win over Bologna in Serie A on 10 December 2017. While Milan didn't do impressively in the first half of the season, with Gattuso they went on a 10-match unbeaten run from Matchday 19 to Matchday 29 in the league, winning seven times and drawing three. Thanks to Gattuso's management, Milan managed a 6th-place finish and were runners-up in the Coppa Italia, as well as reaching the Round of 16 in the Europa League (where they lost 5‚Äì1 on aggregate against Arsenal). Milan qualified for the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League group stage as the sixth-placed team of the 2017‚Äì18 Serie A, but were originally banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even. In July 2018, Li's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club.https://gd.lu/rcsl/4j3ZH8 On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a ‚Ç¨32-million installment on time in order to refinance the ‚Ç¨303-million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, ownership of the club was officially transferred to Elliott Management Corporation. Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and the ban was overturned on 20 July 2018. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014‚Äì2017 and 2015‚Äì2018.

Recordings took place in Vanguard studios in 71 West 23rd Street, New York City. The title track remains one of the most popular Vietnam protest songs from the 1960s and originally appeared on a 1965 7\\" EP titled Rag Baby: Songs of Opposition. On the album, \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" appears following \\"The Fish Cheer\\", which at concerts became a Country Joe standard. At Woodstock, Joe had the crowd yell F-U-C-K instead of F-I-S-H. Another musical highlight is the track \\"Janis\\" written for McDonald's then-girlfriend Janis Joplin. It is the second song written for a female musician for their albums, the other being \\"Grace\\". Two singles were released in the wake of the album. These include \\"Janis\\"/\\"Janis (instrumental)\\" and \\"Who Am I\\"/\\"Thursday\\". The second album was released just seven months after the debut and is another prime example of the band's psychedelic experimentation. It again features organ-heavy psychedelia and Eastern melodic lines and more acoustic guitar than their debut production. During this time, the band continued to build on their growing fame by performing at local venues like the Fillmore Auditorium. Despite the familiarity of the opening track, the album itself sold less than its predecessor. The album, as a whole, fit well in the psychedelic scene of San Francisco. The band effectively used satirical humor to express their outspoken views toward the Vietnam War and other hot topics of the counterculture. Although the rest of the tracks were not as popular, they still were accessible and showcased Country Joe McDonald as a lead vocalist. With the creativity of the band reaching a climax, the band began touring nationally and became positively regarded for their live light shows. The title song faced a legal challenge from the estate of New Orleans jazz trombone pioneer Edward \\"Kid\\" Ory, whose daughter Babette claimed that McDonald had appropriated the melody for his song from Ory's classic \\"Muskrat Ramble\\" as recorded by Louis Armstrong & his Hot Five in 1926.

It is used in the injection molding and the printing industry. It is made by a hand injection molding machine. It is a simple machine which contains a barrel, handle, nozzle, mold and heaters. Printing In the printing industry, a hand mold specifically refers to a two-part mold used for casting hand-made type. Inside the mold is a matrix. In particular, it refers to a system for casting movable type, pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg, which was widely used in the early era of printing in Europe (15th-16th century). In this method, the type was made by punching a letter-shaped cavity in a matrix made of some soft metal (typically copper). Then this matrix would be held in the lower part of the mold, the upper part would close on it, and molten type metal would be poured into the cavity. Using the hand mold, the printer could quickly make any additional type he might need.Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58‚Äì69) Injection molding In injection molding, hand molds refer to simple molds that have no provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand mold is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the molds and the molds must be removed after each cycle to remove the moldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mold. They are usually single cavity molds, but may be multi-cavity if the molding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of the simplicity of the parts. If only a short run is required then the molds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels. Bullet casting Hand cast bullets remain popular with the handloading, muzzleloading and small custom ammunition loading communities. In a tradition dating back to the beginning of firearms, molds matched to the bore (and the chamber for breech loading weapons) are custom made for each weapon. Anywhere from one to six cavities are carved into the molding block, along with appropriate gates and sprues. As the blocks are now usually made out of aluminum, which does not allow lead alloys to stick, only a small amount of parting compound is needed.http://www.neihandtools.com/mold_info.html References Category:Casting (manufacturing) Category:Plastics industry Category:Printing terminology Category:Typography ","title":"Hand mould"},{"id":"8129127","text":"Ingleby Greenhow is a village and civil parish in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire, England.

The population taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100 and whilst the details are included in the civil parish of Nether Silton, North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population to be about 90 in 2015. History The village is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book as either Chipuic or Capuic in the Allerton hundred. Chipuic or Capuic is translated from Old Scandinavian as meaning market-place. At the time of the Norman invasion, the manor was split between Orm, son of Gamil, Arnketil and Gillemicel. Afterwards some of the land remained with the Crown, but some was granted to Hugh, son of Baldric as the main tenant. Up to the 13th century the lands were granted to the Mowbray family who installed mesne lordships to the Nevill and Malbiche families. The manor then passed to a Nicholas de Punchardon, who in turn sold to one Ingram Knout around 1316. After the Knout family ran into financial trouble, Margaret Knout married into the Lepton family to retain some of the land, with other parts being owned by the Bransby family at the start of the 15th century. When the Lepton family also ran into financial problems, they sold their land to Thomas, Lord Fauconberg of Newburgh in 1640 and they retained this land until 1808. Remnants of the quarrying of limestone, sandstone and ironstone can be seen on the hills to the east of the village as well as the line of the tramway that connected them to the lime kilns. The tramway was not used after 1890. The remains of those Lime Kilns to the west of the village are designated a scheduled ancient monument. There had been a chapel dedicated to St Margaret built around 1300, but this disappeared at the time of the reformation. A private chapel was built in 1894 by the local landowner where Wesleyan held service. This has since passed into private hands. Governance The village is within the Richmond (North Yorkshire) UK Parliament constituency. It is within the North Hambleton electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Osmotherley ward of Hambleton District Council. Geography The nearest settlements are Nether Silton to the north-east and Cowesby to the south-east. The A19 road lies to the west. At the east end of the village, Eller Beck runs off the Kepwick Hall Estate to join the Marl Pits Beck to the north. These form part of the Cod Beck tributary system that feed the River Swale. The 1881 UK Census recorded the population as 168. At the end of the road to the disused quarries, to the east of the village, lies the old Hambleton Drove Road which forms part of the Cleveland Way National Trail.

It lies about two miles north west of Bolton town centre. It is bounded by Deane to the south, Markland Hill to the west and Smithills and Halliwell to the north. History Historically within the boundaries of the county of Lancashire, Heaton was created a township in the 12th century. It was in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Deane in the hundred of Salford. Its name derives from the Old English heah and tun meaning enclosed ground on high land and it was recorded as Heton in 1227 and Heton under Horewich in 1332. In the reign of Edward I Richard de Hulton had a charter of free warren in his demesne lands here. The Heatons were an important family in the Deane area. They date back to the 12th century and originated from around Ulverston in north Lancashire. From the 14th century some of the Heaton family held land in Heaton-under-the forest (or Heaton-under-Horwich) in the parish of Deane. This family lived in Heaton Old Hall and built Heaton New Hall. From this family they gave their surname to Deane's township of Heaton. Geography Heaton lies 2¬Ω miles north west of Bolton on the lower south facing slopes of the West Pennine Moors. The township covered 1630 acres, its boundary is the River Croal to the south and is crossed by the road from Bolton to Chorley and contains the area of Markland Hill. The underlying rocks are Coal Measures containing sandstone and slate. Religion Christ Church, Heaton has its origins in a second-hand iron church erected in 1878.

This subgenre contrasts with classical and Neoclassical tragedy, in which the protagonists are of kingly or aristocratic rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. The Ancient Greek theorist Aristotle had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. In Britain, the first domestic tragedies were written in the English Renaissance; one of the first was Arden of Faversham (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are A Woman Killed with Kindness (1607), A Yorkshire Tragedy (1608), and The Witch of Edmonton (1621). Othello can be classified as a domestic tragedy. Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of Restoration drama, when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of George Lillo and Sir Richard Steele in the eighteenth century.

North America Poinsettia The ancient Aztecs (ruling tribe in central Mexico at the time of contact with Europe) prized the poinsettia as a symbol of purity. Centuries later, Mexico's early Christians adopted the poinsettia as their prized Christmas Eve flower. The Mexican poinsettia, known as the Christmas Flower in North America, is used in most Christmas decorations, owing to its bright red color and its blooming season coinciding with the Christmas holiday season. However, florist dye them in common colors or even add shimmers to make them much more visually engaging during Christmas. Christmas cactus Christmas cactus, also known as orchid cactus, often blooms around Christmas time. Pendulous stems of Christmas cactus make it a great choice for hanging baskets. There are a number of different cactus species sold as \\"Christmas cactus\\". Christmas Cactus flower Christmas rose One plant called Christmas rose is regarded as a true Christmas flower in certain parts of the world. Christmas rose (Serissa) is also known as the \\"snow rose\\" or \\"winter rose\\". Originally from tropical regions of Asia, cultivated Serissa often blooms during the winter. On the occasion of Christmas Eve, it is traditional for young women in North America to exchange specially designed Christmas roses resembling their spirit of fraternity. Another plant known as Christmas rose is Helleborus niger. Europe Holly Holly is the plant most associated with Christmas in many European countries. Holly wreaths are hung on doors, and sprigs of holly are used to trim Christmas puddings. Ivy Like most of the other Christmas flowers, ivy leaves symbolize eternity and resurrection. The ivy leaf has been associated with the ancient Egyptian god, Osiris, and the Greco- Roman god, Attis; both of whom were resurrected from the dead. Mistletoe Mistletoe is a Christmas plant whose origin is said to date back to the Pagans. Druid priests used this Christmas plant two hundred years before the birth of Christ in their winter celebrations. A more modern tradition is to exchange kisses under a sprig of mistletoe.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served four terms as the Delegate from the 49th District of the Virginia House of Delegates from 2004 to 2012. As an openly gay man, Ebbin has made history several times through his electoral success. In 2003, he became the first openly gay person and first openly LGBT person elected to the Virginia House of Delegates and the Virginia General Assembly. In 2011, he became the first openly gay person and first openly LGBT person elected to the Virginia Senate. Ebbin is one of five openly LGBT people serving in the Virginia General Assembly (alongside Mark Sickles, Mark Levine, Dawn Adams, and Danica Roem). Early life A 1985 graduate of the American University in Washington, D.C., Ebbin was a Fellow at the University of Virginia's Sorensen Institute of Political Leadership in 2000. A longtime Democratic Party activist, Ebbin spent a decade on the party's state central committee and was a delegate to both the 2000 and 2004 Democratic national conventions. In 2012, Ebbin completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. House of Delegates He first sought the 49th district seat in 2003, narrowly winning a five-person Democratic primary and facing no Republican opponent in the general election. He took office in January 2004 and was re- elected unopposed in 2005. Ebbin faced only an Independent Green opponent in 2007, winning easily, and ran unopposed in 2009. The district includes a large part of South Arlington, the Del Ray and Arlandria portions of the City of Alexandria and parts of Bailey's Crossroads in Fairfax County.  State Senate  Ebbin decided to give up his seat in the House of Delegates to run for the Virginia State Senate in 2011, following Patsy Ticer's announcement that she would not seek re-election. He ran in the 30th district, comprising parts of Arlington, Alexandria and Fairfax County; the district leans heavily Democratic. He faced a heated Democratic primary election held on August 23, 2011, with two opponents: Rob Krupicka, a member of the Alexandria city council, and Libby Garvey, a member of the Arlington school board. Krupicka, who led in fundraising, was widely considered the favorite but Ebbin prevailed narrowly in what local newspapers called an \\"upset\\" and a \\"shocker\\". Ebbin took 39% of the vote to Krupicka's 36% and Garvey's 25% ‚Äì a margin of 335 votes. The 30th district race was the second most expensive primary in the state, with the three Democratic candidates raising a combined $746,000. In the general election, Ebbin faced Republican candidate Tim McGhee and prevailed easily. He took office as a Virginia state senator on January 11, 2012. Ebbin serves on five Senate committees: Finance and Appropriations; Commerce and Labor; Privileges & Elections; General Laws and Technology; and the Transportation Committee. He serves on a number of Commissions and interim Committees including the Task Force to Commemorate the Centennial Anniversary of Women's Right to Vote, the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules, the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission, and the Joint Subcommittee to Evaluate Taxation Preferences.

He also passed legislation to decriminalize marijuana, allow localities to institute fees on throw away bags, and create a legal avenue for employees to sue their employers for wage theft. :Source: Virginia State Board of Elections :Source: Virginia State Board of Elections Source: Virginia State Board of Elections  2014 Congressional Campaign  On January 30, 2014, Ebbin announced his candidacy in the Democratic primary for the 8th Congressional district seat being vacated by Congressman Jim Moran. The 8th Congressional District is Virginia's most Democratic district, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+21, and one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South. The heavily contested Democratic primary drew a number of challengers, including former Lt. Governor Don Beyer, State Delegate Patrick Hope, former Northern Virginia Urban League Chief Lavern Chatman, mayor of Alexandria William D. Euille, radio-talk show host Mark Levine, and Virginia Tech professor Derek Hyra. Ebbin finished third in the June 10, 2014 Democratic primary with 6,262 votes, while Beyer won the primary with 17,783 votes. Beyer went on to win the general election on November 7, 2014.

It is a category A listed building, and the grounds are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes of Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. It is located near Strathpeffer in the east of Ross-shire in the Scottish Highlands. History Background The castle was granted to John of Killin, 10th Chief of Clan MacKenzie (1485-1561) after he fought at the Battle of Flodden. The castle was passed to his great-grandson Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, who granted it in 1608 to his brother Sir Roderick \\"Rorie\\" Mackenzie. In 1605 Sir Roderick married Margaret MacLeod, heiress of Torquil MacLeod of Lewis, bringing her immense wealth into the family and also settling the feud between the MacLeods and the Mackenzies over the Barony of Coigach, which thus passed into the Mackenzie family. Castle history The castle is believed to have been built on the site of a very ancient Pictish fort from before the 12th century. The current castle is the result of work carried out in the early 17th century by Sir Roderick Mackenzie, the ancestor of the Earl of Cromartie. The castle has remained the seat of the Earls of Cromartie ever since. In 1746 George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, forfeited the estate, following his support for the ill-fated 1745 Jacobite Uprising. The estates, but not the title, were restored to his son in 1784. The castle was reported to already be in a run-down state earlier in the same century, when the estate was badly debt-ridden. By 1814 it was described as \\"Quite a ruin... deserted except by crows\\", though this may have applied more to the upper upper floors. In the mid 19th century, Castle Leod was completely renovated by the Hay-Mackenzies. Descendants of the 3rd Earl, the Hay-Mackenzies were restored to the earldom of Cromartie when Anne Hay- Mackenzie married George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland in 1861. In 1851 large extensions were added to the north of the castle, which were rebuilt in 1904. The roof was made watertight as recently as 1992. The castle remains the home of the Earl of Cromartie, and is open to the public on a limited number of days. The castle A compact L-Plan tower house, built of red sandstone, forms the earliest part of the castle, and may be based on a 15th-century building. An additional section was later added in the re-entrant angle, making the castle square in plan, and accommodating a larger staircase and extra bedrooms. The date 1616 is carved on a dormer window, but it is not known if this date refers to the original phase or the extension. The addition was built over the parapet of the original front, and is more decorative in style. In some parts the walls of the castle are thick. Other defensive measures include the iron grilles which remain on some lower windows, and numerous splayed gun loops and arrow-slit windows. The rooms, some wood- panelled, are decorated with many Mackenzie portraits from past centuries, as well as antique furnishings and large-scale antique maps. Many original fittings are to be found around the castle. The grounds include two Spanish chestnuts, said to have been planted by John of Killin in 1556, to mark the confirmation of his acquisition of Castle Leod by Mary Queen of Scots. Outlander Castle Leod is widely considered to be the inspiration behind Castle Leoch, the seat and home of the laird of Clan Mackenzie, in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander historical fiction series. It was considered as a filming location for the TV series, yet Doune Castle was selected, due to its ease of location. This may be surprising to viewers who know Castle Leod as the seat of the Clan Mackenzie and accurately represents the historical period which Diana Gabaldon seeks to portray. Diana Gabaldon told STV that \\"When the TV show began scouting locations, I suggested Leod as a possibility. It's entirely accurate as to period, of course, and has magnificent grounds, with a park of enormous, exotic trees planted by centuries of MacKenzies and their visitors. (Diana herself planted a \\"very modest\\" rowan, as her \\"own wee contribution\\" to the history). http://glasgow.stv.tv/articles/315281-best- selling-author-diana-gabaldon-talks-to-stv-about-her-love-for- scotland/?fromstreampost=218408 See also *Strathpeffer *Clan Mackenzie *Clan MacLeod of Lewis References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20061207032202/http://www.clan- mackenzie.org.uk/clan/leod.html * http://highlandhbt.org.uk/projects/castle- leod Category:Castles in Highland (council area) Category:Category A listed buildings in Highland (council area) Category:Listed castles in Scotland Category:Clan Mackenzie Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Historic house museums in Highland (council area) Category:Ross and Cromarty ","title":"Castle Leod"},{"id":"8129295","text":"Odette is a 1950 British war film based on the true story of Special Operations Executive French agent, Odette Sansom, living in England, who was captured by the Germans in 1943, condemned to death and sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp to be executed. However, against all odds she survived the war and testified against the prison guards at the Hamburg Ravensbr√ºck trials. She was awarded the George Cross in 1946; the first woman ever to receive the award, and the only woman who has been awarded it while still alive. Anna Neagle plays Odette Sansom and Trevor Howard plays Peter Churchill, the British agent she mainly worked with and married after the war. Peter Ustinov plays their radio operator Alex Rabinovitch. Colonel Maurice Buckmaster, who was head of the SOE's French Section, played himself in the film, as did Paddy Sproule, another FANY female SOE agent.Paddy Sproule obituary Plot In response to a radio broadcast request for photographs of France, mother of three Odette Sansom sends a letter to the Admiralty, but an addressing mistake brings her to the attention of the Special Operations Executive, who need French people to go back to their homeland as espionage agents. She completes her training in September 1942 and is sent to France. She travels to Cannes, where she is met by Captain Peter Churchill, her superior. She also meets \\"Arnauld\\" (Adolphe Rabinovitch), another agent. Her first assignment is to go to Marseilles to pick up plans for the docks there. Barely warned in time of a raid organized by Abwehr Colonel Henri (Hugo Bleicher) in Cannes, Odette, Peter and Arnauld are forced to relocate to Annecy, where they rendezvous with Jacques. Learning of the Maquis, Peter requests arms, medicines, etc. for them. He is then recalled to London. A large airdrop of supplies is arranged. Later, however, Henri finds Odette in Annecy. From a captured agent, he has learned all about Odette's network and claims that he and others, disaffected with Hitler, wish to make contact with the British. However, she suspects otherwise and orders the other agents to disperse. Shortly after Peter returns to France, she and Peter are captured in Annecy by Henri and eventually taken to Fresnes Prison, near Paris; Arnauld was away when the hotel where they were staying was raided. Odette is tortured by the Gestapo, but does not break and is sentenced to death. An apologetic Henri visits her; at her request, he arranges for her to see Peter one last time, though she hides her fate from him. She is then taken to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp on 26 July 1944 and immediately placed in solitary confinement. The Germans believe Odette's lies about Peter, that he is related to Winston Churchill and that she was the brains of the network, while he was a playboy dilettante, and he is merely imprisoned. With Germany invaded and collapsing, on 16 April 1945, the camp commandant is ordered to execute his prisoners, but he orders a subordinate to see to Odette's safety. When the inmates learn that Hitler is dead, they riot. A guard comes for Odette; she believes she is to be executed, but the commandant instead takes her to the advancing Americans, believing another of her lies, that she is Peter's wife and therefore related to the British Prime Minister. Back in England, she is reunited with Peter. The end of the film contains a title card saying as follows: > \\"It is with a sense of deep humility that I allow my personal story to be > told. I am a very ordinary woman to whom a chance was given to see human > beings at their best and at their worst. I knew kindness as well as cruelty, > understanding as well as brutality.

R. Wendhausen as Colonel  Production  The film was directed by Herbert Wilcox, and the screenplay by Warren Chetham-Strode was based on Jerrard Tickell's non-fiction book Odette: The Story of a British Agent. It was jointly produced by the husband and wife team Herbert Wilcox and Anna Neagle. Neagle was originally reluctant to play the role so Wilcox offered it to Mich√®le Morgan and Ingrid Bergman, both of whom turned it down. Eventually when the real Odette suggested Neagle play her, Neagle agreed. Both Odette Sansom (by then Odette Churchill) and Peter Churchill served as technical advisors during the filming, and the film ends with a written message from Odette herself. Sansom and Neagle spent considerable time in France, visiting locales associated with the story. Sansom later said that Neagle \\"was absolutely into it. In fact it took one year after the end of the film to get back to normal, she was more upset by doing that film than I was reliving the experience.\\" Sansom said that she lobbied intensely for the film not to be made in Hollywood, for fear that it would be fictionalised, and that she was pleased by the result. Reception It premiered at a Royal Command Film Performance before King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the Plaza Cinema, London on 6 June 1950. Box Office The film was the fourth most popular movie at the British box office in 1950. According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winners' at the box office in 1950 Britain were The Blue Lamp, The Happiest Days of Your Life, Annie Get Your Gun, The Wooden Horse, Treasure Island and Odette, with \\"runners up\\" being Stage Fright, White Heat, They Were Not Divided, Trio, Morning Departure, Destination Moon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Little Women, The Forsythe Saga, Father of the Bride, Neptune's Daughter, The Dancing Years, The Red Light, Rogues of Sherwood Forest, Fancy Pants, Copper Canyon, State Secret, The Cure for Love, My Foolish Heart, Stromboli, Cheaper by the Dozen, Pinky, Three Came Home, Broken Arrow and Black Rose. Wilcox later said it was his most profitable film.Wilcox p 193 Critical New York Times critic Bosley Crowther said that the film portrays \\"a pretty punk secret agent\\" who \\"lacks the wit or caution to avoid a most obvious trap that is set for her\\" by Henri. Crowther wrote that \\"the point of the picture, so far as we can see, is to get Miss Neagle into prison, as quickly as possible, so she can suffer elaborately. And this she does, like the stalwart and noble lady-actress that she is. For the rest of the picture, Miss Neagle is tortured‚Äîand so are we.\\" References  External links   Newsreel footage of film premiere Category:1950 films Category:1950s war films Category:1950s spy films Category:British films Category:British war films Category:British spy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the French Resistance Category:Spy films based on actual events Category:World War II films based on actual events Category:World War II spy films Category:Films directed by Herbert Wilcox Category:Films set in Cannes Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in Germany ","title":"Odette (1950 film)"},{"id":"8129325","text":"Bridgehead is a fair trade coffeehouse chain based in Ottawa, Ontario.

In November 2006, Bridgehead was voted Ottawa's \\"Best Coffee/Tea House\\" by readers of lifestyle weekly Ottawa XPress. Bridgehead also sells coffee by mail through its website.  History  Bridgehead was formed in Toronto, Ontario, originally as Bridgehead Trading, in 1981, by two United Church ministers and two social activists who were concerned with small-scale coffee farmers in Nicaragua. Bridgehead was the first company to offer Canadian consumers fairly traded coffee, as a group of volunteers sold coffee from the basements of churches in Toronto. The business grew rapidly and was soon acquired by Oxfam Canada in 1984. Under Oxfam Canada, Bridgehead became a formally incorporated, for-profit company. Oxfam Canada's aim was not to focus on the coffee that Bridgehead was funded and grew from, but to bring in a more diverse fair-trade product line. This eventually led to a decrease in profits and eventually a dip into losses. A profile of Bridgehead's post- Oxfam management in the Ottawa Citizen claimed that Oxfam Canada's Bridgehead ultimately failed in the mid-1990s due in part to a \\"lack of sound business practices.\\"Chianello, Joanne (2002) \\"Bridgehead bounces back: Sticking to your ethics can work as long as the business plan is based on more than good intentions\\" in Ottawa Citizen (May 4, 2002), p.H1, H4. In May 1998, Bridgehead was acquired by Shared Interest. This U.K. based lending society held the Bridgehead name in hopes of finding a buyer. Shared Interest only needed to hold the name for a year as in 1999; an offer arrived from Tracey Clark. Clark wanted to restore Bridgehead to its former status as a fair-trade coffee and tea company. In April 2000, Bridgehead Inc. was formed, and on June 17, 2000, the first Bridgehead Coffeehouse opened at 362 Richmond Road in Westboro, Ottawa, Ontario. Clark originally relied on financing from family and friends, but by 2002, Bridgehead was owned by 30 investors.Chianello, 2002:H4 Also in 2002, Clark opened a central kitchen to serve Bridgehead's line of food products. Bridgehead expanded from one outlet in 2000Cook, Gay (2000) \\"Bridgehead Offers Coffee with a Difference\\" in Ottawa Citizen (July 12, 2000) to nine by 2008,Bridgehead.ca \\"Locations\\" at http://www.bridgehead.ca/en/AboutUs/locations.asp and currently operates twenty outlets, requiring the company to provide calorie counts for all of its food products. June 2012 marked the opening of Bridgehead's own roastery, which is now where all of the coffee that is sold by the company is roasted. A further development is the introduction of alcohol to Bridgeheads beverage lineup. In July 2015, According to the reports, Bridgehead Coffee opened a 1,850-square-foot location in a six-storey office at the corner of Pinecrest road and Iris Street. As of September 2015, select Bridgehead locations began to offer beer from local breweries Beau's and Beyond the Pale, as well as wine and coffee-inspired cocktails. In 2017, Bridgehead began working with Carleton University's Mass Spectrometry Centre to uncover answers about how coffee beans age on a cellular level. In December 2019, the company announced it was being sold to Aegis Brands, parent company of the Second Cup coffee chain.  Locations  Bridgehead Coffee has 20 locations in the Ottawa region.

It runs from New York State Route 27 (NY 27, named the Sunrise Highway) exit 52A in North Patchogue to NY 25A in Mount Sinai. The road was to have to run further south along North Ocean Avenue and South Ocean Avenue through the village of Patchogue, but that proposal was canceled. CR 83 is known as North Ocean Avenue south of Granny Road in Medford and as Patchogue‚ÄìMount Sinai Road north of that point. Route description CR 83 begins at an interchange with NY 27 (Sunrise Highway exit 53) in the hamlet of North Patchogue in the town of Brookhaven. CR 83 proceeds north from NY 27 as a county-maintained continuation of North Ocean Avenue, retaining the moniker northward as a four-lane roadway. At Shaber Road, the route crosses into the center of North Patchogue, the route leaves the commercial hamlet for a junction with CR 99 (Woodside Avenue). CR 83 continues northward through the town of Brookhaven, crossing past multiple residences and the route turns northwest, crossing into the Summerfield section. The route becomes a divided highway, crossing under a line of the Long Island Rail Road just west of the hamlet of Medford. Just north of the tracks, CR 83 crosses into an at-grade interchange with Long Island Avenue, which parallels the tracks. CR 83 continues north along North Ocean Avenue as a four-lane highway through Brookhaven, reaching a junction with Express Drive South, marking an interchange with the Long Island Expressway (I-495; exit 63). The route crosses through another commercial section, crossing a junction with CR 16 (Horseblock Road). Becoming a four-lane divided highway, CR 83 crosses a junction with Granny Road, changing monikers to Patchogue-Mount Sinai Road. Turning northeast, the median widens as the route crosses past several residential neighborhoods. The route passes the Bald Hill Cultural Park, crossing an interchange with South Bicycle Path, crossing northward and soon northwest through Brookhaven. The median shrinks again, turning northward into a junction with NY 25 (Middle Country Road). Continuing north along Patchogue- Mount Sinai Road, CR 83 turns northeast past Hawkins Path, entering an interchange with NY 112.Signage marking the southern terminus of CR 83 in North Patchogue. The interchange with NY 27 is just ahead of the signAfter NY 112, CR 83 continues past Pine Ridge Golf Club, continuing northeast through Brookhaven as a divided highway. The route turns northward, crossing an interchange with Canal Road. The route passes multiple residential communities, crossing a junction with Mount Sinai-Coram Road. After another northwestern turn, CR 83 reaches a junction with NY 25A in Mount Sinai. This junction marks the northern terminus of CR 83, whose right-of-way terminates at the junction a couple miles southeast of Mount Sinai Harbor and the Long Island Sound. History Origins and former alignments CR 83 was assigned on December 13, 1949. Until the late 1950s, North Ocean Avenue followed a more westerly alignment between Austin Avenue, immediately south of the interchange with NY 27 in North Patchogue, to CR 99 (Woodside Avenue). Today, the old road is still intact for the most part as Old North Ocean Avenue. The expansion of the Sunrise Highway east of Oakdale cut off the southern terminus between Austin and Willmarth avenues in the 1950s, but a frontage road reconnected the old and new sections. When the interchange with NY 27 was reconstructed in the late 1980s, another frontage road connecting Old North Ocean Avenue replaced the one that was built in the 1950s. The intersection with Woodside Avenue was eliminated in the mid-1970s. North of Woodside Avenue, North Ocean Avenue initially utilized its present alignment up to Bayside Avenue in Patchogue Highlands. At a location between Bayside Avenue and Fairview Avenue, North Ocean Avenue broke from its present alignment, running parallel to the west of the modern routing between Fairview Avenue and Wrana Drive. Today, only two segments of the road remain in the form of First Avenue, a short, dead end street off Fairview Avenue, and Brookrun Drive, a street off Masonic Avenue with a dead end located south of the present CR 83‚ÄìWrana Drive intersection. At Wrana Drive, North Ocean Avenue rejoined the current alignment for before separating at a location near Robinson Avenue and Petty Lane. The road rejoined the modern routing at the Long Island Lighting Company High Tension Line right-of-way midway between I-495 and CR 16\\\\. This segment was completely abandoned as North Ocean Avenue was realigned to accommodate exit 63 along I-495 (the Long Island Expressway). Within Patchogue and North Patchogue, a trolley line used to run along South Ocean Avenue, North Ocean Avenue, and what is now Old North Ocean Avenue. This trolley line ran into Holbrook and veered to the northwest at Canaan Lake along what is known as Traction Boulevard, while the current Old North Ocean Avenue moved northeast. Extension to Mount Sinai A northward extension of North Ocean Avenue was built between 1971 and 1972 and named Patchogue‚ÄìMount Sinai Road.New Highway Opens Up in Central Brookhaven (Columnist Unknown); The Mid-Island News; December 21, 1972. A housing development that was being built along Granny Road almost blocked construction of the roadway. The section in the vicinity of the former Bald Hill Ski Bowl was built in similar fashion to a limited-access highway to make driving through hilly region of Farmingville much easier. The bridge over South Bicycle Path was actually installed at least twelve years before the road was laid out. Loftier plans once existed to extend the limited-access status north of Mooney Pond Road, but legend has it they were literally crossed out in pencil. Several junctions along the new road were once proposed to be upgraded into interchanges. Beyond Bald Hill, there was to be an interchange across NY 25\\\\. The northbound ramps to NY 25 were to be accessible to on and off ramps leading to a residential side street called New Lane. NY 112 had a proposed interchange as well that would have utilized Hawkins Road. For a short time, NY 112 acted as the northern terminus of CR 83\\\\. Farther north, the intersections with Canal Road and Coram‚ÄìMount Sinai Road would have been upgraded as part of the construction of two unbuilt highways, the Port Jefferson‚ÄìWesthampton Beach Highway (CR 111) and the North Brookhaven Expressway (NY 347), respectively. Upgrades and North Shore extensions Patchogue‚ÄìMount Sinai Road was built as a four-lane highway, while North Ocean Avenue was originally a two-lane road. In the late 1940s, the one-lane arch bridge that carried the Long Island Rail Road over North Ocean Avenue was replaced with a concrete slab bridge with provisions for a second lane. From the 1940s into the 1970s, this bridge had an empty right of way for an unbuilt southbound lane, implying that the proposal to widen the road dated back to the post-war era. Long Island Avenue was a divided highway at this intersection decades before North Ocean Avenue was. By the mid-1970s, North Ocean Avenue was finally widened to four lanes as well, at least as far south as the Sunrise Highway (NY 27). This widening filled the gap beneath the bridge, but eliminated a connecting road to Brookrun Drive. There were once plans to extend CR 83 northward beyond its northern terminus at NY 25A. Unlike most proposed highway extensions north of NY 25A, this proposal would have extended the highway north, then curve it east through Miller Place to Sound Beach. Another proposed spur would have led to the Cedar Beach Town Park, which lies on a peninsula separating Long Island Sound and Mount Sinai Harbor. The spur would have been designated CR 83A.

It can be debated if Zito was head of his own crime family or, he may have been a powerful capo of the Chicago Outfit with his own crew based in Central Illinois. This information is unclear and it seems as though the files on Mr. Zito lack the investigatory evidence that he was in fact the \\"Godfather of the Prairie.\\" In any case, Zito was a very powerful force in Springfield and the Central and Southern areas of Illinois. Born in San Giuseppe, Sicily, Zito immigrated with his family to Illinois. During Prohibition, Zito became involved in bootlegging, prostitution, and illegal gambling. During this period, Zito was convicted of violating federal liquor laws. Based in Springfield, Illinois, Zito and the St. Louis crime syndicate ran illegal gambling and drug trafficking operations in rural Illinois. While attending the 1957 Apalachin Conference in Apalachin, New York, Zito was captured with numerous other mobsters when the New York State Police raided the meeting. Although indicted in a federal investigation into organized crime in the Midwest, Zito remained in power into the 1970s.

Saltis was born in Budapest, Austro-Hungarian Empire to Slovaks Jakob Saltis (from Spi≈°) and Maria Polaczek (from ≈†ari≈°sk√°, Pre≈°ov)Illinois, Deaths and Stillbirths Index, 1916-1947 and immigrated to the United States in 1905, becoming a saloon owner in Joliet, Illinois.1920 United States Federal Census He moved to Chicago with the announcement of the Volstead Act in 1920. With the assistance of John \\"Dingbat\\" O'Berta, a candidate for the Illinois State Senate, Saltis began supplying illegal alcohol to Chicago's speakeasies in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. During this time, Saltis remained on good terms with Chicago crime boss and his South Side neighbor Al Capone, whose Chicago Outfit began dominating Chicago's bootlegging soon after his arrival in the early 1920s. Indeed, by the mid-1920s, only the Saltis-McErlane organization remained independent from the eight satellite gangs under Capone's control.Frank McErlane and the Chicago Beer Wars at http://www.crimemagazine.com However, soon becoming entrenched in territory disputes with many of Capone's satellite gangs, Saltis began talks for a secret alliance with Capone rival Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss's North Side Gang. at hymieweiss.com Throughout the next year, Saltis began preparing for war as smaller rivals such as the Southside O'Donnell's (for which an attempt would be made on his life in late-1925) and sometimes allied Sheldon Gang began to threaten Saltis's hold on the Back of the Yards neighborhood. Soon gunmen such as Frank \\"Lefty\\" Koncil, Charlie \\"Big Hayes\\" Hubacek, and Frank McErlane joined Saltis's ranks. On August 6, 1926, Sheldon Gang member John \\"Mitters\\" Foley was killed by Frank Koncil while in Saltis's territory. While Koncil, along with O'Berta and Saltis, were arrested and charged with murder O'Berta's considerable political influence (as well as assistance from WeissHymieweiss at hymieweiss.com) was able to get the case dropped on November 9. The following year O'Berta, with Saltis and many other of Capone's subordinates, managed to arrange a conference at the Hotel Sherman on October 20, which included Al Capone, George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, Vincent \\"The Schemer\\" Drucci, Jake \\"Greasy Thumb\\" Guzik, Ralph Sheldon, William Skidmore, Maxie Eisen, Jack Zuta, and Christian Betsche, and managed to agree on a general ceasefire of the various gang wars, specifically between the Chicago Outfit and the North Side Gang, as well as the gang war between Saltis-McErlane and the Sheldon Gang. The ceasefire lasted a little over two months before war broke out again when members of Saltis-McErlane gang killed Sheldon Gang member Hillary Clements on December 30. As the gang war continued between Saltis and the Sheldon Gang over the Back of the Yards neighborhood, Al Capone had begun to move in on Saltis's territory, as the war was beginning to turn in favor of the Sheldon Gang. When Koncil and Hubacek were lured into an ambush and killed on March 11, 1927, Saltis pleaded to Capone to negotiate peace between the Sheldon Gang in exchange for a large cut of Saltis's profits. By the end of the gang war, however, Saltis's gang began to disintegrate as Frank McErlane left Saltis in late 1929 over disagreements over McErlane's share. When O'Berta and his chauffeur, Sam Malaga, disappeared on March 25, 1930, allegedly taken for a \\"one way ride\\", O'Berta was later found dead of a gunshot wound to the head. With his associates gone and his organization all but destroyed, Saltis quickly retired to his home on Barker Lake in Winter, Wisconsin.Historic Barker Lake Lodge at www.barkerlakelodge.com Joe Saltis later died at age 53 from complications of a stomach ulcer in Chicago's Cook County Hospital in 1947. Despite his retirement, when Frank J. Loesch, chairman of the Chicago Crime Commission compiled his \\"Public Enemies\\" list of the top 28 people he saw as corrupting Chicago in April 1930, Saltis was listed. (Capone headed the list). The list was widely published, gaining Saltis a measure of nationwide notoriety. Further reading *Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of Chicago: An Informal History of the Chicago Underworld.

It has never been released on its own in the United States, as it was included on the 4AD/Rykodisc US reissue of Home Is in Your Head in 1992. History The Dirt Eaters represented a step forward in the evolution of His Name Is Alive. While still recorded at HNIA leader Warren Defever's home, the small success of his first two LPs for 4AD had allowed him to considerably improve his home recording studio. Much more so than the previous releases, The Dirt Eaters is a song-oriented effort, with mostly ethereal folk songs replacing the sound collages and avant-pop of Livonia and Home Is in Your Head. Four songs were recorded for the EP in late 1991, and a remix of \\"Are We Still Married?\\" was also included. Released early in 1992, the EP was somewhat meant to promote this remix, for which a video by the Brothers Quay had been made. Therefore, the front cover says \\"Are We Still Married - His Name Is Alive - The Dirt Eaters.\\" Track listing Original 4AD release The original 1992 release of The Dirt Eaters on 4AD (BAD2005) on vinyl and CD, contained the following track listing: #\\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" ‚Äì 3:37 #\\"Are We Still Married?\\" ‚Äì 2:59 #\\"Is This the Way the Tigers Do?\\" ‚Äì 3:37 #\\"We Hold the Land in Great Esteem\\" ‚Äì 4:03 #\\"The Dirt Eaters\\" ‚Äì 3:44 Only tracks one to four are listed on the sleeve, although \\"The Dirt Eaters\\", ostensibly a \\"hidden track,\\" is referred to in the liner notes. Lyrics are given for tracks one to four, although these are actually the lyrics for tracks two to five. This was probably done so as to not have to print the lyrics for \\"Man on the Silver Mountain,\\" a cover of the Rainbow song written by Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio. By not printing the lyrics, HNIA and 4AD avoided having to obtain permission. \\"Are We Still Married?\\" is remixed by Ivo Watts-Russell and John Fryer of This Mortal Coil. The duo had also done production work on HNIA's first two albums. This mix is sometimes called The Dirt Eaters Mix or the This Mortal Coil Remix. \\"The Dirt Eaters\\" contains a sample of Jack Nicholson from the movie Ironweed: \\"I'd eat all the dirt in this yard for you. And all the weeds. And all the dog bones too, if you asked me.\\" A later 4AD compilation called ...and dog bones too, which featured \\"The Dirt Eaters\\", was named after this part of the song. Besides the Rainbow cover, all of the other songs are written by Defever, credited as His Name Is Alive, except for \\"The Dirt Eaters\\" which is by Melissa Elliot, a member of HNIA at this time, and the leader, not coincidentally, of a band called The Dirt Eaters. Rykodisc US release and later 4AD reissue The Dirt Eaters EP was originally available in the United States only as an import. When Rykodisc reissued the band's back catalog for American release in the summer of 1992, the tracks from the EP were included on the CD for Home Is in Your Head. With the Rykodisc CD long out of print, this has made The Dirt Eaters EP a rarity in the United States. When 4AD reissued Home Is in Your Head on CD in 1998, they used the same track listing, instead of reissuing The Dirt Eaters EP on its own.

Biography Early life Born in New York City,Application for U.S. Passport, dated December 24, 1919, ancestry.com Morton grew up in Chicago in the Jewish neighborhood centering on Maxwell Street. As a young man, Morton won the admiration of the Jewish community for making a part of Chicago's West Side safe for them by creating a defense society to drive their enemies away.Landesco, John. \\"Organized Crime in Chicago\\" in The Illinois Crime Survey. The Illinois Association for Criminal Justice, 1929, p. 1031 The Chicago police also suspected him of at least two murders. World War I After the United States declared war on Imperial Germany, Morton enlisted in the American Expeditionary Forces. He served with distinction and was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French Republic. By the war's end, he had been promoted to Lieutenant. Death Morton died when he was thrown from his horse and trampled as he was riding in Lincoln Park. Grief-stricken members of the North Side gang, including George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, Vincent \\"The Schemer\\" Drucci, Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss, and Louis \\"Two Gun\\" Alterie took the offending horse from its stables, led it to the spot where Morton died, and then shot the horse \\"with four slugs to the head\\". Morton received a funeral with full military honors by the American Legion. He was seen off by prominent politicians, city officials, and gangsters. According to the Chicago Daily News, 5,000 Jews paid their respects to Morton that day. In popular culture Morton's death and its aftermath were later fictionalized in the film The Public Enemy. After a horse kicks to death his friend Samuel \\"Nails\\" Nathan (Leslie Fenton), Tom Powers (James Cagney) buys the horse and guns it down in the stables. The incident may also have inspired the infamous horse head scene in Mario Puzo's The Godfather. References Bibliography *English, T. J.

Carrollo was born in Santa Cristina Gela, a town in the province of Palermo, Sicily, and immigrated with his family to the United States when he was three years old, initially settling in New York City before moving to Kansas City. His father was Antonio Carrollo and his mother Rosa Maria Carrollo. At some time after 1917, Carrollo became a close friend and enforcer for future Kansas City mob boss John Lazia. During the early 1920s, when Lazia was arrested for bootlegging, Carrollo accepted responsibility for the crime and went to prison for a short time. By the late 1920s, Lazia controlled all organized crime in Kansas City and Carrollo was a top lieutenant. On the night of July 10, 1934, Carrollo drove Lazia and his wife Marie to their apartment building. When Lazia got out of the car, an unidentified \\"hit team\\" gunned him down in a hail of submachine gun fire. Lazia last word's were for Carrollo to drive Marie to safety. Carrollo and Marie Lazia escaped unharmed. The murder was never solved. With the aid of the Kansas City Pendergast political organization, Carrollo became the new mob boss. Carollo and newly appointed Kansas City police chief Otto Higgins became closely involved in numerous criminal activities. In 1939, Treasury Agents under Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. started pursuing Carrollo. Carrollo responded by refusing any warrants and sending his gunmen to harass the agents. However, on October 20, 1939, Carrollo, Higgins, and Tom Pendergast were convicted of income tax evasion and sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. While at Leavenworth, Carrollo was discovered trafficking in contraband within the prison and was transferred to Alcatraz, the high security prison in San Francisco Bay. Released from prison in 1954, Carrollo was eventually deported to Italy. In 1979, Carrollo died of natural causes in Kansas City. Further reading *Bernstein, Lee.

The most common kinetoplast structure is a disk, but they have been observed in other arrangements. Kinetoplasts are only found in Excavata of the class Kinetoplastida. The variation in the structures of kinetoplasts may reflect phylogenic relationships between kinetoplastids. A kinetoplast is usually adjacent to the organism's flagellar basal body, suggesting that it is tightly bound to the cytoskeleton. In Trypanosoma brucei this cytoskeletal connection is called the tripartite attachment complex and includes the protein p166. Trypanosoma In trypanosomes, a group of flagellated protozoans, the kinetoplast exists as a dense granule of DNA within the large mitochondrion. Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite which causes African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness), is an example of a trypanosome with a kinetoplast. Its kinetoplast is easily visible in samples stained with DAPI, a fluorescent DNA stain, or by the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with BrdU, a thymidine analogue. Structure The kinetoplast contains circular DNA in two forms, maxicircles and minicircles. Maxicircles are between 20 and 40kb in size and there are a few dozen per kinetoplast. There are several thousand minicircles per kinetoplast and they are between 0.5 and 1kb in size. Maxicircles encode the typical protein products needed for the mitochondria which is encrypted. Herein lies the only known function of the minicircles - producing guide RNA (gRNA) to decode this encrypted maxicircle information, typically through the insertion or deletion of uridine residues. The network of maxicircles and minicircles are catenated to form a planar network that resembles chain mail. Reproduction of this network then requires that these rings be disconnected from the parental kinetoplast and subsequently reconnected in the daughter kinetoplast.Torri, A., et al. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1996. pages=1029‚Äì42. This unique mode of DNA replication may inspire potential drug targets. The best studied kDNA structure is that of Crithidia fasciculata, a catenated disk of circular kDNA maxicircles and minicircles, most of which are not supercoiled. Exterior to the kDNA disk but directly adjacent are two complexes of proteins situated 180Àö from each other and are involved in minicircle replication. Variations Variations of kinetoplast networks have also been observed and are described by the arrangement and location of their kDNA. *A pro-kDNA kinetoplast is a bundle-like structure found in the mitochondrial matrix proximal to the flagellar basal body. In contrast to the conventional kDNA network, a pro-kDNA kinetoplast contains very little catenation and its maxicircles and minicircles are relaxed instead of supercoiled. Pro-kDNA has been observed in Bodo saltans, Bodo designis, Procryptobia sorokini syn. Bodo sorokini, Rhynchomonas nasuta, and Cephalothamnium cyclopi. *A poly-kDNA kinetoplast is similar in kDNA structure to a pro-kDNA kinetoplast. It contains little catenation and no supercoiling. The distinctive feature of poly-kDNA is that instead of being composed of a single globular bundle as in pro-kDNA, the poly-kDNA is distributed among various discrete foci throughout the mitochondrial lumen. Poly-kDNA has been observed in Dimastigella trypaniformis (a commensal in the intestine of a termite), Dismastigella mimosa (a free-living kinetoplastid), and Cruzella marina (a parasite of the intestine of a sea squirt). *A pan-kDNA kinetoplast, like poly-kDNA and pro- kDNA, contains a lesser degree of catenation but it does contain minicircles that are supercoiled. Pan-kDNA kinetoplasts fill most of the mitochondrial matrix and are not limited to discrete foci like poly-kDNA. Pan-kDNA has been observed in Cryptobia helicis (a parasite of the receptaculum seminis of snails), Bodo caudatus, and Cryptobia branchialis (a parasite of fish). *A mega-kDNA kinetoplast is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the mitochondrial matrix, but does not contain minicircles. Instead, sequences of kDNA similar in sequence to other kinetoplast minicircles are connected in tandem into larger molecules approximately 200kb in length. Mega-kDNA (or structures similar to mega-kDNA) have been observed in Trypanoplasme borreli (a fish parasite) and Jarrellia sp. (a whale parasite). The presence of this variety of kDNA structures reinforces the evolutionary relationship between the species of kinetoplastids. As pan-kDNA most closely resembles a DNA plasmid, it may be the ancestral form of kDNA. Replication Figure 8. Illustration of the location of the antipodal protein complex relative to kinetoplast disk (above) and the migration of minicircle to these complexes for replication (below). The replication of the kinetoplast occurs simultaneously to the duplication of the adjacent flagellum and just prior to the nuclear DNA replication. In a traditional Crithidia fasciculata kDNA network, initiation of replication is promoted by the unlinking of kDNA minicircles via topoisomerase II. The free minicircles are released into a region between the kinetoplast and the mitochondrial membrane called the kinetoflagellar zone (KFZ). After replication the minicircles migrate by unknown mechanisms to the antipodal protein complexes that contain several replication proteins including an endonuclease, helicase, DNA polymerase, DNA primase, and DNA ligase, which initiate repair of remaining discontinuities in the newly replicated minicircles. This process occurs one minicircle at a time, and only a small number of minicircles are unlinked at any given moment. To keep track of which minicircles have been replicated, upon rejoining to the kDNA network a small gap remains in the nascent minicircles, which identifies them as having already been replicated. Minicircles that have not yet been replicated are still covalently closed. Immediately after replication, each progeny is attached to the kDNA network proximal to the antipodal protein complexes and the gaps are partially repaired. Figure 9. Illustration of kinetoplast rotation during minicircle replication. Kinetoplast (K) divides first and then the nucleus (N) in dividing T. brucei As minicircle replication progresses, to prevent the build-up of new minicircles, the entire kDNA network will rotate around the central axis of the disk. The rotation is believed to be directly connected to the replication of the adjacent flagellum, as the daughter basal body will also rotate around the mother basal body in a timing and manner similar to the rotation of the kinetoplast. By rotating, the minicircles of the daughter kinetoplast are assembled in a spiral fashion and begin moving inward toward the center of the disk as new minicircles are unlinked and moved into the KFZ for replication. While the exact mechanisms for maxicircle kDNA have yet to be determined in the same detail as minicircle kDNA, a structure called a nabelschnur (German for \\"umbilical cord\\") is observed that tethers the daughter kDNA networks but eventually breaks during separation. Using FISH probes to target the nabelschnur, it has been found to contain maxicircle kDNA. Kinetoplast replication is described as occurring in five stages, each in relation to the replication of the adjacent flagellum. * Stage I: The kinetoplast has not yet initiated replication, contains no antipodal protein complexes, and is positioned relative to a single flagellar basal body. * Stage II: The kinetoplast begins to show antipodal protein complexes. The flagellar basal body begins replication, as does the kinetoplast. The association of the replicating kinetoplast to the two basal bodies causes it to develop a domed appearance. * Stage III: The new flagellum begin to separate and the kinetoplast takes on a bilobed shape. * Stage IV: The kinetoplasts appear as separate disks but remain connected by the nabelschnur. * Stage V: The daughter kinetoplasts are completely separated as the nabelschnur is broken. Their structure is identical to that seen in Stage I. DNA repair Trypanosoma cruzi is able to repair nucleotides in its genomic or kinetoplast DNA that have been damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by the parasite‚Äôs host during infection. DNA polymerase beta expressed in T. cruzi is employed in the removal of oxidative DNA damages by the process of base excision repair. It appears that DNA polymerase beta acts during kinetoplast DNA replication to repair oxidative DNA damages induced by genotoxic stress in this organelle.

He was a relative of Joseph Mangano and Philip Mangano, of Chicago, and a suspected relative of Mafia Don Vincenzo \\"Vincent\\" Mangano. Early years A prominent member of Al Capone's organization during Prohibition, Mangano oversaw criminal operations in the Near West Side of Chicago, including illegal gambling, fencing, extortion and prostitution. Although Mangano received police protection through bribery, in 1928, a number of Mangano's establishments were raided by police Captain Luke Garrick. Garrick's house was then bombed in retaliation. Although Garrick survived the bombing, no further interference was taken by local law enforcement in the district. Over the course of his life, Mangano claimed he had been arrested over 200 times without ever spending a night in jail, explaining, \\"They were all bum raps...and besides I had good lawyers.\\" After the end of Prohibition, in 1933, Mangano kept a very low profile. However, he was still involved in gambling and other criminal activities throughout the decade. Drive by shooting In August 1944, Mangano was driving back from Cicero, Illinois, with his lady friend, Rita Reyes, and his bodyguard, Michael Pontillo. They stopped for a brief drink at the all-night Paddock Lounge. Back in the car, someone in Mangano's group noticed that a black sedan was following them and they pulled over to the side of Blue Island Avenue. As the sedan pulled alongside them, several unidentified gunmen armed with shotguns shot and killed Mangano. The gunmen then turned the sedan around, drove back and killed Pontillo as he was pulling Mangano out of the street. An autopsy later revealed that Mangano's body contained over 200 shotgun pellets and six .45 caliber bullets. The bullets had been rubbed in garlic, supposedly believed by mobsters to cause infections (not that it was necessary in Mangano's case).Mangano bio Police officials and the media speculated that Mangano had been killed either in a dispute with the Outfit over a recent cigarette hijacking, or from withholding gambling revenue. Mangano's murder was never solved. Bibliography *Bernstein, Lee. The Greatest Menace: Organized Crime in Cold War America. Boston: UMass Press, 2002. *Chiocca, Olindo Romeo.

Notable leaders included Luciano Leggio, Salvatore Riina, Leoluca Bagarella and Bernardo Provenzano. Corleonesi affiliates were not restricted to mafiosi of Corleone. During the Second Mafia War in the early 1980s, the Corleonesi clan opposed the faction of the Palermitans represented, among others, by Gaetano Badalamenti, Stefano Bontate and Salvatore Inzerillo. The victory of the Corleonesi, and in particular the rise of Tot√≤ Riina, marked a new era in the history of the Sicilian Mafia. Between 1992 and 1993, the Corleonesi initiated a season of attacks against the state, followed by the State-Mafia Pact. History Beginnings In February 1971, the Corleonesi clan's first boss Luciano Leggio, ordered the kidnapping for extortion of Antonino Caruso, son of the industrialist Giacomo Caruso, and also that of the son of the builder Francesco Vassallo in Palermo.http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/02_rel_6.pdf Leggio was linked to the murder of the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo.http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/04_rel_02.pdf He became a fugitive, and was finally captured in Milan on 16 May 1974. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975. By the end of the 1970s, his lieutenant Salvatore Riina, who was also a fugitive, was in control of the Corleonesi clan. The Corleonesi's primary rivals were Stefano Bontade, Salvatore Inzerillo and Tano Badalamenti, bosses of various powerful Palermo Mafia families. Between 1981 and 1983, Bontade and Inzerillo, together with many associates and members of both their Mafia and blood families, were killed. There were up to a thousand killings during this period as Riina and the Corleonesi, together with their allies, wiped out their rivals. By the end of the war, the Corleonesi were effectively ruling the Mafia, and over the next few years Riina increased his influence by eliminating the Corleonesi's allies, such as Filippo Marchese, Giuseppe Greco and Rosario Riccobono. In February 1980, Tommaso Buscetta fled to Brazil to escape the brewing Second Mafia War instigated by Riina. Whereas Riina's predecessors had kept a low profile, leading some in law enforcement to question the very existence of the Mafia, Riina ordered the murders of judges, policemen and prosecutors in an attempt to terrify the authorities. A law to create a new offence of Mafia association and confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by Pio La Torre, secretary of the Italian Communist Party in Sicily, but it had been stalled in parliament for two years. La Torre was murdered on 30 April 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a general of the Italian Carabinieri, to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, he was gunned down in the city centre with his wife, Emanuela Setti Carraro, and his driver bodyguard, Domenico Russo. In response to public disquiet about the failure to effectively combat the organisation Riina headed, La Torre's law was passed ten days later.Inside The Mafia , National Geographic Channel, June 2005. On 11 September 1982, Buscetta's two sons from his first wife, Benedetto and Antonio, disappeared, never to be found again, which prompted his collaboration with Italian authorities. This was followed by the deaths of his brother Vincenzo, son-in-law Giuseppe Genova, brother-in- law Pietro and four of his nephews, Domenico and Benedetto Buscetta, and Orazio and Antonio D 'Amico. Buscetta was arrested in Sao Paulo, Brazil once again on 23 October 1983, and extradited to Italy on 28 June 1984. Buscetta asked to talk to the anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, and began his life as an informant, referred to as a pentito. Buscetta was the first high-profile Sicilian Mafiosi to become an informant; he revealed that the Mafia was a single organisation led by a Commission, or Cupola (Dome), thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes.Follain, p.19-21 Buscetta helped judges Falcone and Paolo Borsellino achieve significant success in the fight against organized crime that led to 475 Mafia members indicted, and 338 convicted in the Maxi Trial. In an attempt to divert investigative resources away from Buscetta's key revelations, Riina ordered a terrorist-style atrocity, the 23 December 1984 Train 904 bombing; 17 people were killed and 267 wounded. It became known as the \\"Christmas Massacre\\" (Strage di Natale) and was initially attributed to political extremists. It was only several years later, when police stumbled on explosives of the same type as used in Train 904 while searching the hideout of Giuseppe Cal√≤, that it became apparent that the Mafia had been behind the attack. Rapido 904: \\"Un intreccio tra mafia, camorra e politica\\", Il Fatto Quotidiano, 27 April 2011 As part of the Maxi Trial, Riina was given two life sentences in absentia. Riina pinned his hopes on the lengthy appeal process that had frequently set convicted mafiosi free, and he suspended the campaign of murders against officials while the cases went to higher courts. When the convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation in January 1992,Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino and the Procura of Palermo , Peter Schneider & Jane Schneider, May 2002, essay is based on excerpts from Chapter Six of Jane Schneider and Peter Schneider, Reversible Destiny: Mafia, Antimafia and the Struggle for Palermo, Berkeley: U. of California Press the council of top bosses headed by Riina reacted by ordering the assassination of Salvatore Lima (on the grounds that he was an ally of Giulio Andreotti), and Giovanni Falcone. Bombings of 1992‚Äì93 On 23 May 1992, Falcone, his wife Francesca Morvillo and three police officers died in the Capaci bombing on highway A29 outside Palermo. Two months later, Borsellino was killed along with five police officers in the entrance to his mother's apartment block by a car bomb in via D'Amelio.Interview of agent Vullo the day after the massacre. Both attacks were ordered by Riina. Ignazio Salvo, who had advised Riina against killing Falcone, was himself murdered on 17 September 1992. The public was outraged, both at the Mafia and also the politicians who they felt had failed adequately to protect Falcone and Borsellino. The Italian government arranged for a massive crackdown against the Mafia in response. News reports in May 2019, indicated that a Cosa Nostra insider revealed that John Gotti of the Gambino crime family had sent one of their explosives experts to Sicily to work with the Corleonesi. This individual allegedly helped plan the bombing that would kill Falcone. One mafia expert was surprised that the two groups would cooperate because the American Cosa Nostra was affiliated with the rivals of the Corleonesi. But another expert said the joint effort was understandable. \\"It may be that the Gambinos at a certain point recognised that the Corleonesi had been victorious in the war between rival families in Sicily ... there is nothing unusual in the traffic of personnel and ideas across the Atlantic ... they were cousin organisations,\\" according to John Dickie, professor of Italian studies at University College London and the author of Mafia Republic ‚Äì Italy‚Äôs Criminal Curse. Decline On 15 January 1993, Carabinieri arrested Riina at his villa in Palermo. He had been a fugitive for 23 years.Italy Arrests Sicilian Mafia's Top Leader, The New York Times, 16 January 1993Brother of top Mafia turncoat shot, BBC News, 21 March 1998Follain p212-213 After Riina's capture, a division emerged among the Corleonesi, and a series of bombings occurred by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland ‚Äî the Via dei Georgofili bombing in Florence, Via Palestro massacre in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, which left 10 people dead and 93 injured as well as severe damage. In total, Riina was given 26 life sentences, and served his sentence in solitary confinement. Giovanni Brusca ‚Äì one of Riina's hitmen who personally detonated the bomb that killed Falcone, and became a state witness (pentito) after his arrest in 1996 ‚Äì has offered a controversial version of the capture of Tot√≤ Riina: a secret deal between Carabinieri officers, secret agents and Cosa Nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of Riina‚Äôs faction of the Corleonesi. According to Brusca, Provenzano \\"sold\\" Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 233-34. Lodato, Ho ucciso Giovanni Falcone, p. 135-37 Some investigators believed that most of those who carried out murders for Cosa Nostra answered solely to Leoluca Bagarella, and that consequently Bagarella actually wielded more power than Bernardo Provenzano, who was Riina's formal successor. Provenzano reportedly protested about the terroristic attacks, but Bagarella responded sarcastically, telling Provenzano to wear a sign saying \\"I don't have anything to do with the massacres\\".Follain, (2012), Vendetta, pp. 230‚Äì231 On June 24, 1995, Bagarella was arrested, having been a fugitive for four years.Reputed Head of the Mafia Is Arrested in Palermo Chase, The New York Times, June 26, 1995 In total, Bagarella was given 13 life sentences plus 106 years and ten months, and solitary confinement for 6 years. Provenzano subsequently took the reigns of the Corleonesi. Provenzano had been a fugitive from the law since 1963. Provenzano was finally captured on 11 April 2006, by the Italian police near his home town, Corleone.\\"'Top Mafia boss' caught in Italy\\", BBC News, 11 April 2006. After the arrest of Provenzano, the power of the Corleonesi was decimated. Affiliation and power of the Corleonesi Corleonesi affiliates were not restricted to mafiosi of Corleone. The Corleone Mafia bosses initiated ‚Äúmen of honour‚Äù, not necessarily from Corleone, whose status was kept hidden from the other members of the Corleone cosca and other Mafia families. Members of other Mafia families who sided with Riina and Provenzano were called Corleonesi as well, forming a coalition that dominated the Mafia in the 1980s and 1990s, that can be considered as a kind of parallel Cosa Nostra. (Giovanni Brusca from the San Giuseppe Jato Mafia family was considered to be part of the Corleonesi faction for example) Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 117-19. The pentito (Mafia turncoat) Antonino Calderone provided first-hand accounts of the leaders of the Corleonesi: Luciano Leggio, Tot√≤ Riina and Bernardo Provenzano. About Leggio, Calderone said: \\"The Corleone bosses were not educated at all, but they were cunning and diabolical,\\" Calderone said about Riina and Provenzano. \\"They were both clever and ferocious, a rare combination in Cosa Nostra.\\" Calderone described Tot√≤ Riina as \\"unbelievably ignorant, but he had intuition and intelligence and was difficult to fathom and very hard to predict.\\" Riina was soft spoken, highly persuasive and often highly sentimental. He followed the simple codes of the brutal, ancient world of the Sicilian countryside, where force is the only law and there is no contradiction between personal kindness and extreme ferocity. \\"His philosophy was that if someone‚Äôs finger hurt, it was better to cut off his whole arm just to make sure,\\" Calderone said.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 230-31.

Early life Maurice Ronet was born Maurice Julien Marie Robinet in Nice, Alpes Maritimes. He was the only child of professional stage actors √âmile Robinet and Gilberte Dubreuil. He made his stage debut at the age of 14 alongside his parents in Sacha Guitry's Deux couverts in Lausanne. After attending the Parisian acting school Centre du Spectacle de la Rue-Blanche, he entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1944, where Jean-Louis Barrault was one of his mentors. When he made his film debut at 22 in Jacques Becker's Rendez-vous de juillet (1949) in a role that was written specifically for him by Becker, he had little interest in pursuing an acting career. After completing the film, he married Maria Pac√¥me (a French stage actress and playwright), and they departed to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie in Provence, where he tried his hand at ceramics. After completing his military service, he returned to Paris in the early 1950s where he took courses in philosophy and physics, and pursued his passion for literature, music (piano and organ), film and painting. His artwork, part of the peinture non figurative movement, was exhibited with friends Jean Dubuffet and Georges Mathieu. He also acted occasionally in small roles in the films of French directors like Yves Ciampi and Ren√© Wheeler, with ambitions of becoming a filmmaker himself. Gradually, however, he came to discover a freedom in acting and a creative satisfaction that provided a synthesis of all his interests. Career Maurice Ronet became one of European cinema's more prolific actors. Between 1955 and 1975 he appeared in over 60 films. He often portrayed characters who were in conflict with themselves or society. He first garnered acclaim at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival for a supporting role in Jean Dreville's Endless Horizons (Horizons sans fin) and over the next few years as the romantic lead in Andr√© Michel's La sorci√®re (The Blonde Witch/The Sorceress, 1956) and in Jules Dassin's He Who Must Die, (Celui qui doit mourir, 1957). It was at the presentation of \\"La Sorci√®re\\" at Cannes where he met a creative and an intellectual counterpart in Louis Malle. Two years later, he made his international box-office breakthrough as Julien Tavernier in Malle's first feature film Elevator to the Gallows (Ascenseur pour l'√©chafaud 1958), which features Jeanne Moreau. He originated the role of Philippe Greenleaf in Purple Noon (Plein soleil, 1960), Ren√© Cl√©ment's adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley . Ronet's defining role reunited him with Malle and Moreau in Le feu follet (The Fire Within, 1963). Playing an alcoholic writer, his indelible portrayal of depression and suicide garnered him the highest acclaim of his prolific career. He was awarded France's Crystal Star (√âtoile de Cristal) and the prize for Best Actor at the 1965 S√£o Paulo Film Festival; the film also won a Special Jury Prize at the 1963 Venice Film Festival. He also collaborated with Claude Chabrol in four films, including The Champagne Murders (Le scandale, (1966), for which he won the Best Actor award at the 1967 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, Line of Demarcation (La ligne de d√©marcation, 1966) and The Unfaithful Wife (La femme infid√®le, 1968). He co-starred with Alain Delon and Romy Schneider in The Swimming Pool (La Piscine, 1969) directed by Jacques Deray. Other highlights include Jacques Doniol-Valcroze The Immoral Moment (, 1962); The Victors (Carl Foreman, 1963); Three Rooms in Manhattan (Trois chambres √† Manhattan, (Marcel Carn√©, 1965); Lost Command (Mark Robson, 1966); ' (, 1967); How Sweet It Is! (Jerry Paris, 1968) starring Debbie Reynolds; Rapha√´l ou le d√©bauch√©, (Michel Deville, 1971); Beau-p√®re (Bertrand Blier,1981) and, one of his final films, Bob Swaim's La Balance, 1982. He was originally cast to play Ali in Lawrence of Arabia. However, he was replaced on location by Omar Sharif due to difficulties with his accent. Ronet made his directorial debut with The Thief of Tibidabo (Le voleur de Tibidabo, 1964), a self-reflexive, picaresque crime story shot in Barcelona, in which he also starred with Anna Karina. He followed it with two documentaries: Vers l'√Æle des dragons (1973), an allegorical journey to Indonesia to film the Komodo dragon and a report on the building of a dam in Cabora Bassa, Mozambique for French television. He directed and produced more programs for television: his own acclaimed adaptation of Herman Melville's Bartleby in 1976 (which was released theatrically in 1978) as well as adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe and Cornell Woolrich stories. He wrote two books: \\"L'ile des dragons\\" (1973), a personal recollection and a chronicle of the making of Vers l'√Æle des dragons, and \\"Le m√©tier de com√©dien\\" (1977), an honest and thorough discussion of the acting profession. Personal life His marriage to Maria Pac√¥me quickly ended in a separation, and they divorced in 1956. In 1966 he constructed his home in the village of Bonnieux, Vaucluse, Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur. He lived there, and in Paris, with Josephine Chaplin from 1977 until his death; their son Julien was born in 1980. He died in a Paris hospital, of cancer, aged 55. He is buried at the cemetery near his home.

Catalogue of life These butterflies mainly inhabit nature reserves, wastelands, mangrove areas and offshore islands. Description Banded Swallowtail Papilio demolion has a wingspan of .Butterflies of SingaporeSamui Butterflies Male upperside is brownish black. Forewings and hindwings are crossed by a broad prominent oblique pale greenish or yellowish-white band that commences just before the middle of the dorsal margin of the hindwing, crosses over on to the forewing and is continued as a series of spots that diminish in size in the upper interspaces to the apex of that wing. On the hindwing this is followed by a subterminal series of similarly-coloured lunules. Underside is fuliginous black, the transverse band that crosses the wings as on the upperside. Forewing: cell with a series of four slender longitudinal pale lines from base; the veins also picked out with pale lines; on the veins that run to the terminal margin these lines are conspicuous only at the apices; there are besides short similar lines between the veins that extend to the terminal margin. Hindwing: the interspaces beyond the transverse medial greenish-white band marked with broad jet-black streaks up to the subterminal line of greenish-white lunules; these streaks medially interrupted by a transverse line of blue scales and succeeded in interspaces 1 and 7 by preapical ochraceous-yellow spots; terminal margin beyond the line of lunules black. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen fuliginous black; beneath, the palpi and abdomen greenish white, the thorax dark grey. Life history In flight. Video clip Adults can be found from January to October. Females lay their eggs in a long string. Eggs hatch in about 3-4 days. Larva are \\"Similar to that of P. erithonius (i. e. Papilio demoleus). Anterior segments are scutellated, furnished with two tentacular processes on the 2nd segment and two short fleshy processes on the 9th and anal segments (Moore). Caterpillas are gregarious in all five instars. The main larval foodplants are Citrus species, Luvunga crassifolia, Luvunga scandens, Melicope lunu-ankenda and Acronychia pedunculata (Rutaceae). Pupa are \\"curved abruptly backwards; head bifid; thorax with a lengthened curved acute thoracic process\\" (Moore). After about twelve days of development the butterfly emerges.

Mass spectrometry In general, peptides can be identified by fragmenting them in a mass spectrometer. For example, during collision- induced dissociation peptides collide with a gas within the mass spectrometer and break into pieces at their peptide bonds. The resulting fragment ions (called b-ions and y-ions) have mass differences corresponding to the residue masses of the respective amino acids. Thus, a tandem mass spectrum contains partial information about the amino acid sequence of the peptide. The peptide sequence tag approach, developed by Matthias Wilm and Matthias Mann at the EMBL, uses this information to identify the peptide in a database. Briefly, a couple of masses are extracted from the spectrum in order to obtain the peptide sequence tag. This peptide sequence tag is a unique identifier of a specific peptide and can be used to find it in a database containing all possible peptide sequences. Peptide fragment notation Peptide fragmentation notation using the scheme of Roepstorff and Fohlman (1984). A notation has been developed for indicating peptide fragments that arise from a tandem mass spectrum. Peptide fragment ions are indicated by a, b, or c if the charge is retained on the N-terminus and by x, y or z if the charge is maintained on the C-terminus. The subscript indicates the number of amino acid residues in the fragment. Prime symbols indicate the number of protons or hydrogens added to the fragment to form the observed ion. For example, y denotes the singly charged ion analogous to a protonated peptide, (y')2+ is a doubly charged ion analogous to a doubly protonated peptide.

He was a member of JAB, which formed in Adelaide in 1976, and Bohdan and the Instigators, which featured in the Melbourne punk rock scene in the late 1970s. He was also a DJ on 3RRR community radio station from 1978 to 1995. Biography Bohdan X was born as Bohdan Roman Kubiakowski in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. By 1976 he had relocated to Adelaide, Australia. In January that year he formed JAB, on guitar and vocals; with Ash Wednesday on bass guitar, synthesiser and tapes; and Johnny Crash (Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and vocals. The band's name is an acronym ‚Äì using the founders' first initials. JAB began as an experimental, electronic rock band, with synthesisers and guitars, but adopted a punk rock style from 1977. He still wears the same pair of pants he used to wear on stage in the late 70's. In late 1977 Bohdan recorded his first solo single, \\"Time to Age\\"/\\"You Got Soul\\", on the Tomorrow label with JAB backing him. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the single as \\"not punk, however, being almost acoustic in a Roy Harper vein\\". JAB relocated to Melbourne the same year, joining an emerging new wave music scene and frequently playing live. He later recalled the scene was \\"pretty dull\\" and that they wanted to \\"wake the dead with punk music\\". JAB broke up in August 1978 and Bohdan formed two short-lived groups, Hong Kong and then Bex. In 1979 he formed Bohdan and the Instigators with former members of The Chosen Few, they disbanded by late 1980. As Bohdan X, his solo releases include a 12-inch extended play, Fear of Flying, on Rumour Records in December 1983. In 1988 he issued a mini-album, Kingsnake, on Rampant Records, which was produced by Ross Wilson and Tony Cohen. Session musicians include James Freud and Mark Ferrie (both ex-Models). Bohdan's performances included fire-eating, \\"at a Melbourne University gig I set the sprinklers off, twice! The fire brigade tried to charge me $150 per truck but I nipped out the window\\". An independent FM radio station was established at RMIT University in central Melbourne in 1976. It became 3RRR, as a community radio station. In 1978 Bohdan joined the station and began broadcasting a show, Punk with Bohdan X, according to Mark Phillips in Radio City, the program was a \\"mix of punk and new wave music, along with his unprofessional, shambolic style of announcing, quickly brought him to cult status among the station‚Äôs presenters\\". The shift to broadcasting from being a musician was \\"better than being in a bloody band, married to blokes who moan all the time\\".Triple R FM He was suspended for six months after playing the Sex Pistols' B-side track, \\"Friggin' in the Rigging\\" (February 1978), which uses the expletive, fuck. Bohdan lasted on 3RRR for 17 years and, when interviewed in November 2006, he reflected on being a radio presenter telling Larissa Dubecki of The Age, \\"I said I wanted a punk show. Greig Pickhaver (later known as the comic HG Nelson) said to come down. They got me to come in at 11am and I was on air that afternoon. Volunteers were a lot harder to come by in those days. But I fitted right in; it was like a family\\". In 1995, the manager, Steven Walker, tried to move Bohdan from his Friday night broadcasting slot ‚Äì he denounced Walker on-air before turning the power off and vacating the studio, leaving the station off air for over half an hour. As of August 2012 Bohdan has a phone-in slot on 3RRR's Vital Bits show on Saturday mornings, where he reports on his life as a sometime accountant, landscape gardener, taxi driver, farmer, and man of the people. On the state of the environment, in Mar 2008, he opined \\"even the dumb bastards are starting to realise something's wrong\\". The segment is notorious for Bohdan's railing against the modern world.

Early years Born in San Giuseppe Vesuviano, Province of Naples, Miranda immigrated with his family to the United States in 1905 and settled in New York. In later years, Miranda's official residence was in Forest Hills, Queens on Long Island.Feinberg, Alexander. \\"MIRANDA BALKS AT GANG INQUIRY; Auto Dealer Questioned in Anastasia Slaying Is One of 7 to Refuse Answers\\", The New York Times, December 15, 1957. Accessed June 18, 2009. \\"Miranda, who lives in Forest Hills, Queens, and has an automobile agency in Manhattan, took the Fifth Amendment thirty-two times as a witness before the Joint Legislative Committee on Government Operations, the so-called watchdog committee.\\" Becoming involved in crime as a teenager, his first arrest was for petty theft and assault in 1915. During Prohibition, Miranda became an associate of Gaetano \\"Tommy Brown\\" Lucchese and was affiliated with the Reina crime family of the Bronx. In 1931, following the end of the Castellammarese War, he became close to Luciano crime family underboss, Vito Genovese and became a made man, or full member, of that crime family. Enforcer for Luciano and Genovese Miranda frequently acted as enforcer for Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano and Genovese along with the occasional hit for the crime family. As the decade progressed, Miranda kept rising through the family ranks. In the 1940s, Miranda used his former ties with Lucchese as a stepping stone in becoming the Luciano family's overseer of their activities in Manhattan's Garment District. After the execution of Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter in 1944, Lucchese took control of Buchalter's garment industry rackets for the Lucchese crime family. Reaching the Top Rank Miranda soon became one of the top Capos in the family, a highly respected and feared gangster. Miranda had criminal interests in illegal gambling, loansharking, and labor racketeering. Throughout this period, Miranda kept close ties to his mentor and one of the top bosses in the family, Genovese. On May 2, 1957, Genovese ordered the assassination of Luciano crime family boss, Frank Costello. Even though the hit failed, Costello soon retired from the family, leaving Genovese in control. Genovese named Miranda as consigliere, making him the number three man after Genovese and underboss Gerardo \\"Jerry\\" Catena. On November 14, 1957, Miranda, Genovese, Catena, and about 60 other Mafia bosses were apprehended by federal agents at the famous Apalachin Conference in Apalachin, New York. Genovese in Prison In 1958, Genovese was indicted on narcotics charges and sentenced to 15 years at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. While serving his sentence, Genovese placed the family under the leadership of a \\"Three Man Ruling Panel\\", made up of acting boss Thomas \\"Tommy Ryan\\" Eboli, Catena, and Miranda. Genovese would relay orders from his prison cell to the panel members as they ran the day-to-day family activities. Law enforcement continued to pursue Miranda and other Mafia bosses. In October 1965, the New York Police Department (NYPD) arrested Miranda and Eboli for parole violations of consorting with known criminals, but all the men were released within a week. On September 22, 1966, Miranda and 12 other high level Mafia members, including bosses from New York, New Orleans, and Florida were arrested at the La Stella Restaurant in Queens, New York. Miranda was once again charged with consorting with known criminals. Each man had to put up $100,000 bail, a total of $1.3 million for all 13 men. Retirement In 1972, Miranda retired from active involvement in family affairs. On July 16, 1973, Michele Miranda died of natural causes in Boca Raton, Florida.

Another office nearby, Duck Holes, had opened in 1866, was renamed Monegatta in 1875, North Monegeeta in 1917, North Monegeetta around 1961 and closed in 1969. Monegeetta North, occasionally referred to as Duckholes, was historically a distinct locality, once featuring its own Hotel (1862-1896) and State school (1868-1903). The former Hotel building remains as a local landmark for travellers on the Melbourne-Lancefield Road. Both Monegeetta and North Monegeetta were stopping points on the Clarkefield-Lancefield railway which operated between 1881 and 1956. Today Monegeetta features Mintaro Homestead (1882), a smaller replica of Melbourne's Government House built by a Captain Gardiner. The main facilities used by the Land Engineering Agency of the Australian Department of Defence are located near the town. These facilities are used to test Australian Army equipment.

Trimsaran is six miles (10 km) from Llanelli, and from Carmarthen. It is close to Burry Port harbour, Pembrey Country Park and the Millennium Coastal Park. The community is bordered by the communities of: Llangyndeyrn; Llanelli Rural; Pembrey and Burry Port Town; and Kidwelly, all being in Carmarthenshire. Between 1909 and 1953 Trimsaran Road railway station on what had been the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway, served the miners and the residents of the village and locality. Trimsaran Colliery There are historical reports of mining activities taking place in the Trimsaran area dating back hundreds of years. By 1896, the Inspector of Mines noted that Trimsaran employed 144 men, producing coal, anthracite, and fireclay. By the early 1900s, three drift mines made up Trimsaran colliery: Caedean (deepest), Waunhir and the Upper slant; all connected underground and on the surface by a tramway. By 1908, Waunhir and Cadean employed 198 men, while by 1918 the workforce had grown to 435. By 1923 352 men employed at Caedean Slant, Upper Slant employed 63 men and Waunhir 126 men. There were three notable mining accidents: *February 1907, Waunhir slant - 6 men died when a coupling plate broke and full mine-cars ran down the drift - the men had no chance. *1909 - an explosion in the Caedean Slant killed 4 men, possibly caused by firedamp. *26 April 1923- 12 men died whilst travelling out of the mine the end of the day shift, when part of the journey of drams, in which they were riding suddenly careered back down the slope after a connecting shackle broke. By 1931 the mine was owned by Amalgamated Anthracite Ltd. and employed 700 men on the existing working. These drifts closed in 1934 and was replaced by the Waunffynhonnau drift (new drift or Wimpey drift), which employed over 300 men in 1945. The mine was closed by the National Coal Board in April 1954, with most of the workforce going to Carway or Pentremawr Colliery. The site was later opened up as part of Celtic Energy's move into opencast mining, called Ffos Las, but was closed in 1997. As part of the redevelopment of the site, it has been approved to become a coarse fishing lake, quad bike and mountain biking centre,Report - Proposed Use of Quad Biking and Paintball Recreational Facilities and Tea Rooms in Existing Dwelling at Culla Park, Culla Road, Trimsaran before proposed redevelopment of the site as a ¬£16 million/1000m horse racing course, training centre and a grandstand for 1,000 spectators. A hotel and up to 250 houses would also be built on the site of the site. Trimsaran Rugby Club Trimsaran is known for its rugby union involvement, and is a sport that plays a part in the local community.

The tradition was once widespread throughout England, but is now only practised in a few areas, particularly Lancashire and West Yorkshire. Background Pace Egg Plays, Upper Calder Valley St George slays Bold Slasher The name pace is derived from Latin pascha ('Easter') (c.f. the adjective paschal). The drama takes the form of mock combat between the hero and villain, in which the hero is killed and brought back to life, often by a quack doctor. In some plays the figure of St George smites all challengers, and the fool, Toss Pot, rejoices. Many Pace Egg plays died out after the Great War, when many of the men who took part in them were killed in action. In Middleton, North Manchester, Pace Egging (performing the Pace Egg Play) was revived in 1967. The Bury Pace Eggers were revived in 1970, and still perform in pubs and squares around the town and surrounding villages in the week before Easter. Midgley Pace Egg was performed by children from the village's primary school, but in recent decades older children from the nearby Calder High School took over. That school is no longer interested in such things, but ex-pupils maintain the tradition, performing in the original Midgley, West Yorkshire location as well as at the tourist magnet, Heptonstall. The plays enjoyed a renaissance in Heptonstall, West Yorkshire in recent decades. The origins are uncertain, but appear to be based on the Midgley tradition. Some versions of the plays have undoubtedly been performed over many hundreds of years. It has become an established Good Friday tradition, and hundreds come to Weavers Square to watch.

H&E; stain. An alveolar macrophage (or dust cell) is a type of macrophage, a professional phagocyte, found in the pulmonary alveoli, near the pneumocytes, but separated from the wall. Activity of the alveolar macrophage is relatively high, because they are located at one of the major boundaries between the body and the outside world. They are responsible for removing particles such as dust or microorganisms from the respiratory surfaces. Alveolar macrophages are frequently seen to contain granules of exogenous material such as particulate carbon that they have picked up from respiratory surfaces. Such black granules may be especially common in smoker's lungs or long-term city dwellers. The alveolar macrophage is the third cell type in the alveolus, the others are the type I and type II pneumocytes. Function Micrograph of carbon-laden macrophages in the lung, H&E; stain lung tissue showing the nucleus and other organelles including the Golgi body and mitochondria. Alveolar macrophages are phagocytes that play a critical role in homeostasis, host defense, and tissue remodeling. Their population density is decisive for these many processes. They are highly adaptive and can release many secretions, to interact with other cells and molecules using several surface receptors. Alveolar macrophages are also involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic and necrotic cells. They need to be selective of the material that is phagocytized to safeguard the normal cells and structures. To combat infection, the phagocytes facilitate many pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to help recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of pathogenic microorganisms. PAMPs all have the common features of being unique to a group of pathogens but invariant in their basic structure; and are essential for pathogenicity (ability of an organism to produce an infectious disease in another organism). Proteins involved in microbial pattern recognition include mannose receptor, complement receptors, DC-SIGN, Toll-like receptors(TLRs), the scavenger receptor, CD14, and Mac-1. PRRs can be divided into three classes: #signaling PRRs that activate gene transcriptional mechanisms that lead to cellular activation, #endocytic PRRs that function in pathogen binding and phagocytosis, and #secreted PRRs that usually function as opsonins or activators of complement. The recognition and clearance of invading microorganisms occurs through both opsonin-dependent and opsonin‚Äìindependent pathways. The molecular mechanisms facilitating opsonin- dependent phagocytosis are different for specific opsonin/receptor pairs. For example, phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized pathogens occurs through the FcŒ≥ receptors (FcŒ≥R), and involves phagocyte extensions around the microbe, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Conversely, complement receptor-mediated pathogen ingestion occurs without observable membrane extensions (particles just sink into the cell) and does not generally results in an inflammatory mediator response. Following internalization, the microbe is enclosed in a vesicular phagosome which then undergoes fusion with primary or secondary lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome. There are various mechanisms that lead to intracellular killing; there are oxidative processes, and others independent of the oxidative metabolism. The former involves the activation of membrane enzyme systems that lead to a stimulation of oxygen uptake (known as the respiratory burst), and its reduction to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), molecular species that are highly toxic for microorganisms. The enzyme responsible for the elicitation of the respiratory burst is known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which is composed of five subunits. One component is a membrane cytochrome made up of two protein subunits, gp91phox and p22phox; the remaining three components are cytosolic-derived proteins: p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. NADPH oxidase exists in the cytosol of the AM when in a quiescent state; but upon activation, two of its cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox, have their tyrosine and serine residues phosphorylated, which are then able to mediate translocation of NADPHox to the cytochrome component, gp91phox/p22phox, on the plasma membrane via cytoskeletal elements. Compared to other phagocytes, the respiratory burst in AM is of a greater magnitude. Oxygen-independent microbicidal mechanisms are based on the production of acid, on the secretion of lysozymes, on iron-binding proteins, and on the synthesis of toxic cationic polypeptides. Macrophages possess a repertoire of antimicrobial molecules packaged within their granules and lysosomes. These organelles contain a myriad of degradative enzymes and antimicrobial peptides that are released into the phagolysosome, such as proteases, nucleases, phosphatases, esterases, lipases, and highly basic peptides. Moreover, macrophages possess a number of nutrient deprivation mechanisms that are used to starve phagocytosed pathogens of essential micronutrients. Certain microorganisms have evolved countermeasures which enable them to evade being destroyed by phagocytes. Although lysosomal-mediated degradation is an efficient means by which to neutralize an infection and prevent colonization, several pathogens parasitize macrophages, exploiting them as a host cell for growth, maintenance and replication. Parasites like Toxoplasma gondii and mycobacteria are able to prevent fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes, thus escaping the harmful action of lysosomal hydrolases. Others avoid lysosomes by leaving the phagocytic vacuole, to reach the cytosolic matrix where their development is unhindered. In these instances, macrophages may be triggered to actively destroy phagocytosed microorganisms by producing a number of highly toxic molecules and inducing deprivational mechanism to starve it. Finally, some microbes have enzymes to detoxify oxygen metabolites formed during the respiratory burst. When insufficient to ward off the threat, alveolar macrophages can release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to call forth a highly developed network of defensive phagocytic cells responsible for the adaptive immune response. The lungs are especially sensitive and prone to damage, thus to avoid collateral damage to type 1 and type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages are kept in a quiescent state, producing little inflammatory cytokines and displaying little phagocytic activity, as evidenced by downregulated expression of the phagocytic receptor Macrophage 1 antigen (Mac-1). AMs actively suppress the induction of two of the immunity systems of the body: the adaptive immunity and humoral immunity. The adaptive immunity is suppressed through AM's effects on interstitial dendritic cells, B-cells and T-cells, as these cells are less selective of what they destroy, and often cause unnecessary damage to normal cells. To prevent uncontrolled inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages secrete nitric oxide, prostaglandins, interleukin-4 and -10(IL-4, IL-10), and transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤). Nitric oxide NO is a major source of immunomodulation in rodents, and is produced by enzyme nitric oxide synthetase type 2 (NOS2) in the alveolar macrophage. NO inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinases involved in production of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, the expression of which is fundamental for T cell proliferation. In humans, however, NOS2 activity has been difficult to verify. There are two explanations for the lack of responsiveness in the promoter of human inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) to NO activation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) + interferon gamma (IFNŒ≥). The first is that there are various inactivating nucleotide variations in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that regulates LPS/IFNŒ≥ induced expression of the mouse NOS2 gene. The second is because of the absence of a nuclear factor in human macrophages that is required for optimum expression of gene NOS2 (LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex). It is assumed that the difficulty in verifying NOS2 is due to a much more tightly controlled expression in human AMs as compared to that in the rodent AMs. NOS2 is part of an autoregulatory feedback loop, wherein an allergen or provoker stimulates inflammatory cytokine production, which in turn stimulates NO production, and NO down-regulates cytokine production. In rats, NO inhibits the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-mediated maturation of dendritic cells, and in humans it inhibits the TNF-alpha- mediated maturation of human dendritic cells, through cyclic GMP-dependent mechanisms. NO prolongs the ability of human dendritic cells to internalize antigens at sites of inflammation, therefore modulating the beginning steps leading to antigen-specific immune responses. NO production has been implicated as relevant to the pathology of asthma. Patients with asthma show an increased expression of iNOS in airway epithelial cells and an increased level of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Prostaglandin endoperoxide 2 (PGE2) Many other immunomodulating factors have been isolated, the most important of which are prostaglandins and cytokines. PGE2 was the first immunomodulator to be derived from macrophages and described. PGE2 functions in amplifiying peripheral blood lymphocyte IL-10 transcription and protein production; as well as in deactivating macrophages and T-cells. PGE2 is an immunomodulatory eicosanoid derived from the cell membrane component, arachidonic acid, and is processed in the arachidonic acid cascade: the successive oxygenation and isomerization of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and PGE2 synthase enzymes. The regulation of target cells by PGE2 occurs via signaling through four cell membrane-associated G-protein-coupled E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, named EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. PGE2 inhibits bacterial killing and ROI production by AM by impairing FcŒ≥-mediated phagocytosis through its ability to stimulate the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) effectors via EP2 and EP4 receptors signaling. EP2 and EP4 receptors signal primarily through stimulatory G protein (Gs), increasing adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and subsequent cAMP formation. cAMP is a second messenger that influences multiple cellular functions via the activation of two downstream effector molecules, protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac-1 and -2). Epac-1 and PKA are both important factors involved in the inhibition of AM bacterial killing. The effects of PKA results from its ability to phosophorylate serine and threonine residues on many cellular proteins, especially transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). cAMP/PKA/CREB axis mediates the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. The killing of phagocytosed bacteria by AMs is dependent upon several distinct microbicidal mechanisms, like the reduced NADPH oxidase-mediated release of ROI. ROI generation by NADPH oxidase is an important bactericidal mechanism after FcR-mediated phagocytosis. PGE2 activates both Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors by ligation, stimulating cAMP production and subsequent activation of downstream cAMP effectors, PKA and Epac-1; both which in turn impair the phosphorylation and phagosomal membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase component, p47phox, thereby inhibiting the respiratory burst. Interleukin-4 and -10 IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a key role in the development of T helper type 2(Th2) cells. IL-4 is important for the differentiation of na√Øve CD4-T cells into mature Th2 type cells; as well as for Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching to IgE and IgG4 during the development of immune responses. Ig is a class of antibody found only in mammals that plays an important role in allergy response and defense against many kinds of pathogens by protecting the body against them by complement activation, opsonization for phagocytosis, and neutralization of their toxins. IL-4 and IL-10 have both been shown to reduce the production of metalloproteinases (endopeptidases which break down collagen and other extracellular proteins) by human AMs. IL-4 has dual effects upon macrophage biological function, which may be either stimulatory or inhibitory. It enhances MHC class II antigen (extracellular protein complex that interacts exclusively with CD4-T cells as part of the exogenous pathway) and Mac-1(surface receptor as part of innate complement system) expression, thus promoting phagocytosis. IL-4 has also been shown to inhibit the production of PGE2 by reducing the expression of the enzyme, prostaglandin H synthase -2 (PGHS-2), which is critical in the production of PGE2. However, IL-4 inhibits production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and -6, which are all important cytokines in the proinflammatory response). IL-10 inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and INF-gamma, thus suppressing the proliferation of T-cells, NK cells, and AM. IL-10 shares similar immunomodulating mechanisms to TGF-Œ≤. It is thought that both cytokines reduce the rate of apoptosis in human alveolar macrophages, thus indirectly enhancing alveolar macrophage-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation. There is a significant increase in the basal rate of apoptosis upon activation by bacterial products. Apoptosis is particularly regulated by the presence of cytokines: IFNŒ≥ increases the rate of apoptosis, whereas IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤ decrease it. However, IL-10 has counterproductive effects on the immune system, and has been shown to actually promote infection by foreign pathogens. The role of IL-10 in bacterial and parasitic infection has been discovered as a strategy to evade host immune systems. There are bacteria which parasitize AMs by invading through their membranes, and thrive by growing and replicating inside of them, exploiting AMs as host cells. Normally, this infection can be eliminated by T-cells, which activate enzymes in alveolar macrophages that destroy the bacteria; but these bacteria have been shown to alter the cytokine signaling network to their advantage. As an inhibitory cytokine, IL-10 facilitates the infection of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes by completely reversing the protective effect of IFNŒ≥ against intracellular Legionella pneumophila replication. Yersinia enterocolitica has also been shown to releases virulence antigen LcrV, which induces IL-10 through Toll-like receptor-2 and CD14 (an accessory surface protein of TLR4-mediated LPS-signaling), resulting in the suppression of IFNŒ≥ and TNF-alpha suppression. Transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) In normal conditions, alveolar macrophages adhere closely to alveolar epithelial cells, thus inducing the expression of the Œ±vŒ≤6 integrin. Integrins are dimeric cell- surface receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits, which activates TGF-Œ≤.< TGF-Œ≤ is a multifunctional cytokine that modulates a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, extracellular matrix synthesis, inflammation, and immune responses. TGF-Œ≤ tightly regulates anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby inhibiting T-lymphocyte function. Integrins avŒ≤6 and avŒ≤8 sequester latent TGF-Œ≤ to the cell surface, where activation can be tightly coupled to cellular responses to environmental stress in the maintenance of homeostasis; integrins also localize activated TGFŒ≤ in the vicinity of the macrophages. Normally mature TGFŒ≤ is secreted as a latent complex with its N-terminal fragment, latency-associated peptide (LAP), which inhibits its activity. The latent complex is covalently linked to the extracellular matrix by binding to latent TGF-Œ≤-binding proteins. TGF-Œ≤ is activated by diverse mechanisms in the lung, ultimately involving either proteolysis or conformational alteration of the LAP. Œ±vŒ≤6 integrin is able to mediate activation of TGF-Œ≤ by binding to TGF-Œ≤1 LAP, which serves as a ligand binding site for the integrin, and is an essential component of the TGF-Œ≤ activation apparatus. Once activated, TGFŒ≤ leads to the suppression of macrophage functionality (cytokine production and phagocytosis). Binding of activated TGF-Œ≤ to its receptors expressed on alveolar macrophages induces a downstream signaling cascade, including phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (R-SMAD)homologs 2 and 3. Phosphorylated SMAD-2 and -3 then form heteromeric complexes with common-mediator SMAD 4 (co-SMAD-4). Once assembled, the complexes translocates into the nucleus via the nuclear pore with the assistance of importins alpha/beta. Once in the nucleus, these complexes accumulate and eventually act as a transcription factors, regulating the expression of TGF-Œ≤ target genes. Thus TGF-Œ≤ signaling involves a direct pathway from the receptors on the surface of a cell to the nucleus. Activation Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are signaling PRRs, capable of recognizing various bacterial proteins. Although bacteria have evolved means of evading host defense mechanisms, they express PAMPs, such as lipoglycans and lipoproteins that are recognized by cells of the innate immune system through the TLRs. Upon binding of PAMPs to TLRs, the TLR triggers inflammatory and defensive responses in the host cell, inducing actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages (a crucial component in endocytosis and motility). Actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages causes the suppression of integrin expression, which in turn causes the deactivation of TGF-Œ≤ and the downregulation of the basal phosphorylation level of SMAD 2/3; subsequently leading to the activation and detachment of alveolar macrophages from the alveolar epithelial cells [15]. Upon activation, macrophages become primed for phagocytosis and begin to secrete proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-Œ± and IL-6). The priming of macrophages involves the enhancement of respiratory burst activity by IFN-Œ≥ and TNF-Œ±. IFNŒ≥ induces both an increased affinity of the NADPH oxidase for NADPH in macrophages, as well as an increased rate of gene transcription and message expression for gp91phox protein. TNF-Œ± acts as an autocrine stimulus by increasing the expression of both p47phox and p67phox transcripts. The ROIs produced during the respiration burst response, in turn, enhance production of TNF-Œ± by macrophages.  Deactivation  Gas exchange must be restored as quickly as possible to avoid collateral damage, so activated lymphocytes secrete IFNŒ≥ to stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 by macrophages. AMs have been reported to produce MMP-9 partly via PGE2-dependent PKA signaling pathways, which are the pathways involved in the inhibition of phagocytosis. MMP-9 activates latent TGF-Œ≤, reinducing expression of Œ±vŒ≤6 integrins on alveolar epithelial cells, thereby returning the alveolar macrophage to a resting state. Activation of TGF-Œ≤ is also advantageous because its production stimulates collagen synthesis in interstitial fibroblasts, which is necessary for restoring alveolar wall architecture.

The film stars Robert Preston and Ellen Drew, with Otto Kruger and Stephen Geray. Night Plane from Chungking was a remake of Paramount's earlier film Shanghai Express (1932). The film was remade as Peking Express (1951). Plot In 1942, during the Japanese invasion of China, due to the carelessness of one of the passengers, Albert Pasavy (Otto Kruger), draws attention from Japanese bombers overhead, to a bus travelling to India along a muddy road. The Japanese bomb the road, hitting a munitions truck carrying Chinese troops. The Chinese officer in charge, demands his wounded be put on the bus and brought to a secret air field. Among the stranded passengers met by U.S. pilot Nick Stanton (Robert Preston), are a beautiful Red Cross nurse, Ann Richards (Ellen Drew), and her traveling companion, Madame Wu (Soo Yong), who is on a secret diplomatic mission. There is also Countess Olga Karagin (Tamara Geva), who is caught spying. Nick and his co-pilot, Captain Po (Victor Sen Yung), are ordered to fly the remainder of the passengers out to safety in India, but the transport aircraft is intercepted by Japanese fighter aircraft and shot down. Nick makes an emergency landing in a jungle. Over the radio, Nick learns that Olga has committed suicide, but the spy was trying to get top-secret information to her superior, who is still among the passengers. Another of the passengers, Doctor Van der Linden (Stephen Geray), goes missing, but returns with food he claims comes from a nearby monastery. The doctor leads everyone on a long hike to the monastery, only to reveal there that he is a Nazi collaborator working with the Japanese. He demands to know where Olga is, not knowing she is dead. All the survivors are captured and held at the monastery. It is up to Nick to try to come up with an escape plan. He convinces Van Der Linden to allow Po to repair the aircraft and to allow the hostages to be exchanged for Olga. A coded message is sent to Nick's headquarters, but the Nazi soon finds out that Olga is already dead. After Pasavy betrays the others and is coldly shot, Nick kills Van der Linden. With Japanese troops in pursuit, Major Raoul Brissac (Ernest Dorian) sacrifices himself to save the others by pulling the pin on a grenade, killing himself along with the Japanese. Nick, Po, Ann and Madame Wu then fly to safety. Having fallen in love, Nick and Ann vow to reunite after the war.

Upon leaving school, his first appearance in the ring was March 1979, aged just 15, using his own name as his shikona, or fighting name. Also starting at the same time was future yokozuna Futahaguro. Makuuchi It took him four years to reach the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1983, aged 19, the same time as fellow Tokachi district rival ≈ånokuni entered the top division. By this time his stablemate Chiyonofuji had been promoted to yokozuna. Hokutoumi made his debut in the top makuuchi division in September 1983. In March 1986 at sekiwake rank he won his first y≈´sh≈ç or tournament title with a record of thirteen wins and two losses. Despite this impressive result he was not immediately promoted to the second highest ≈çzeki rank as he had not done particularly well in the previous two tournaments, only managing 30 wins in the most recent three tournaments when 33 is generally required. It also did not help his cause that there were already five ≈çzeki, leaving the Sumo Association with no incentive to loosen the promotion criteria. However, he carried on producing excellent results with an 11‚Äì4 in May, and then went 12‚Äì3 in July, securing his promotion for the September tournament. Futahaguro was promoted to yokozuna at the same time. At this point he was still fighting under his real name, and his coach decided a new name was appropriate. He wished to acknowledge his home district of Tokachi, but the kanji for Tokachi (ÂçÅÂãù) literally mean 'ten wins' and it was felt that this might be bad luck, limiting his wins in any tournament to ten. As a compromise, he took the name Hokutoumi (ÂåóÂãùÊµ∑), taking the kanji Âãù ('win') from the second kanji of Tokachi but pronouncing it as the first kanji. Yokozuna After his second tournament title in March 1987 and a runner-up performance in May, he was promoted to yokozuna for the July tournament. In 1988 he suffered a severe back injury which kept him out of three tournaments. It also appeared he would miss the start of the January 1989 tournament, but it was delayed due to the death of the emperor, and he came back to win the tournament. He also won the May tournament. In July, he took part in an historic play-off with Chiyonofuji ‚Äì the first time ever that two yokozuna from the same stable had met in the ring (the rules of sumo state that wrestlers from the same stable can only fight each other in a play-off). On the last day of the March 1990 tournament, he fought in a rare three-way play-off with ≈çzeki Konishiki and sekiwake Kirishima (who was promoted to ≈çzeki after the tournament). In a play-off, wrestlers fight each other in turn, the first to win two consecutive bouts winning the tournament. First, Hokutoumi fought Konishiki and lost. Konishiki was then drawn up against Kirishima. Konishiki only needed to win this bout for the tournament, but Kirishima won. Next was Kirishima against Hokutoumi, Kirishima needing just this bout for his first y≈´sh≈ç. Hokutoumi won. Hokutoumi then beat Konishiki in the next bout, thus winning the tournament. On the fourteenth day of the March 1991 tournament, he injured his left knee during a bout with ≈ånokuni, but managed to go on to win the tournament with 13 wins. After this, Hokutoumi had many absences due to his knee. At this time there were four yokozuna, but Chiyonofuji retired in May 1991, ≈ånokuni in July and Asahifuji in January of the next year (1992), leaving Hokutoumi the sole yokozuna. Left with this responsibility he struggled on, but he withdrew from the March 1992 tournament after losing his first two matches to Mitoizumi and Kushimaumi, and announced his retirement shortly before the May 1992 tournament at the age of 28 years and 10 months. Citing shoulder, elbow and knee injuries, he said he had \\"lost my fighting spirit to continue training.\\" In the space of just one year, all four yokozuna had retired. Hokutoumi had fought 29 basho as yokozuna. Following his retirement, there were no yokozuna on the banzuke for the first time in 60 years, and sumo went without a reigning yokozuna for the next eight months, until the promotion of Akebono in January 1993. Retirement from the ring Following his retirement Hokutoumi became a member of the Japan Sumo Association with the toshiyori name Hakkaku-oyakata. He opened up his own training stable, Hakkaku stable, which has had four top division wrestlers, Hokut≈çriki, Kaih≈ç, Okinoumi, and Hokutofuji. He occasionally appears on NHK sumo broadcasts as a commentator and analyst. He proposed to a graduate of Konan Women's University in October 1989, and was married in March 1990. On December 18, 2015, he was appointed as chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, after former chairman Kitanoumi died in office on November 20, 2015. He had been serving as an executive director of the board under Kitanoumi since 2012. His appointment was until the end of March 2016. He then won a contested ballot on March 28, 2016, defeating Takanohana, and was confirmed for a further two-year term. He was re-elected on March 26, 2018, for another two- year term. Fighting style Hokutoumi was primarily a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques that got his opponents out of the ring as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or initial charge, and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the throat. To do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. He said in an interview with Channel 4 television that the technique he most enjoyed was tsuri-dashi or lift out, although he was only credited with this kimarite once in official tournament competition (against Terao in November 1989).

They found cult level acclaim and recognition in the 70s, but had little commercial success. Since then they have come to be regarded as prime movers who were forerunners of the later punk movement. Band history  1974: Formation, band members  The Doctors of Madness were formed in 1974 in a basement in Brixton, south London, by the band's composer and lead singer/guitarist Richard Strange, known as ‚ÄòKid‚Äô Strange. To provide a platform for his musical ideas and compositions, which analysed urban culture neurosis and systems of control, Strange joined forces with Stoner (Colin Bentley: bass guitar, vocals), Peter DiLemma (Pete Hewes: drums, vocals), and Urban Blitz (Geoff Hickman: electric violin, baritone violectra and lead guitar) to provide a link between the early 1970s progressive rock and glam rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music and the later 1970s punk rock of the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Strange cited The Velvet Underground and writer William S. Burroughs as major influences on the band's music, which fused avant-garde hard rock with warped quasi-classical tones.  1975: Manager Bryan Morrison  In March 1975 the band started playing gigs at a pub in Twickenham, south-west London, where they were spotted by a talent scout for music manager Bryan Morrison, who had managed Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett and Marc Bolan. Morrison came to see them and was impressed. Morrison and his then partner Justin de Villeneuve launched an intensive publicity campaign to promote the band, which included an appearance on the BBC's prime time UK television The Twiggy Show. They were the opening act at the three-day Great British Music Festival at Olympia in London on 31 December 1975. The band signed to Polydor Records for the UK and Europe. The Doctors of Madness were BBC Radio John Peel Show featured artists on 25 November 1976, and received British television exposure during 1975/76 on the Twiggy Show and also the Janet Street-Porter Show.  1975-1978: Tours, theatrical style  The Doctors of Madness toured extensively in Great Britain and continental Europe, gigging in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden. Their early stage shows, in which Strange appeared with dyed-blue hair and Stoner wore skeletal-style make-up, incorporated costumes, props, make-up, projected backdrop images, smoke, strobe lights, theatrical spot-lighting and taped sound effects. Stoner recalled that they had wanted to create \\"a really outrageous image to match the songs Richard was writing\\". Strange spoke of a cinematic style of song- writing, \\"where the images come in and out, not making much sense on a rational level, more on a sensory one ... very sleazy, underground and outrageous.\\" Support acts during their heyday included The Sex Pistols (Middlesbrough 1976), The Jam (London Marquee on several occasions 1976), Joy Division (as \\"Warsaw\\" Manchester 1976) and Simple Minds (as \\"Johnny and the Self Abusers\\" Falkirk 1976). Richard 'Kid' Strange was best man at Dave Vanian's (of the Damned) wedding. The band's tour manager and sound engineer was Dave 'Hobbs' Hilsden, who Strange called 'Obbsy'. Hilsden was subsequently sound engineer, road manager and crew boss for Mot√∂rhead for 30 years until his death in 2015.  1975-1978: Albums  Between 1975 and 1977, the Doctors of Madness recorded three albums for Polydor records: Late Night Movies, All Night Brainstorms [1976], produced by John Punter; Figments of Emancipation [1976], recorded at Abbey Road studios with producer John Leckie; and Sons of Survival [1978], recorded at Majestic Studios in Clapham, South London in late 1977. It was decided to give the band's third album a more 'punk' feel, and the tracks on Sons of Survival were mostly recorded as high- volume live performances in the studio. \\"Bulletin\\" from Sons of Survival, backed by \\"Waiting\\" from Late Night Movies, All Night Brainstorms, was released as a single in late 1977. A posthumous Doctors of Madness compilation, Revisionism, was released by Polydor in 1981, the band having split in late 1978. The band's first three albums were re-released on CD by Ozit Records.  1978: Urban Blitz, Dave Vanian, final gig  Early in 1978, immediately after the release of Sons of Survival, Urban Blitz left the band because of musical and personal differences. He was briefly replaced by singer Dave Vanian of punk rock band The Damned, who had temporarily split. The Doctors of Madness were known informally as 'the Doctors' (or 'the Dox'). After the release of Sons of Survival in 1978, Strange experimented with renaming the band 'The Doctors'. Kid Strange, Stoner and Peter DiLemma continued as a trio, minus violinist, before disbanding after disappointing sales of the latest album and withdrawal of record company support. They played their final gig at The Music Machine in Camden, North London, on 26 October 1978, with TV Smith of The Adverts as a guest. Later developments  2003-2006: Performances in Japan and UK  In later years, Richard Strange continued to promote and perform Doctors of Madness music while pursuing an extensive international career as a solo artist. In 2003 he performed in Japan, backed by ex-Pogues multi-instrumentalist David Coulter and Sister Paul, a Japanese Doctors of Madness tribute band based in Tokyo; and in Leeds and Doncaster, Yorkshire, England, with bassist Stoner in 2006.  2011: Recognition  Recognition of Doctors of Madness influence on the emergence of British punk rock was documented in the book An Unauthorised Guide to Punk Rock: The Early English Scene [2011], which included the Deviants, the Doctors of Madness, David Bowie, the Sex Pistols and the Clash. The band's reappraisal as an important influence in British punk rock had prompted the re-release of their albums on CD in 2002.  2014: Reunion  Doctors of Madness reunion in 2014. The original line-up of the Doctors of Madness - Kid Strange, Stoner, Peter DiLemma and Urban Blitz - reunited in London in October 2014 for a one-off performance at the South Bank Centre as part of Richard Strange's \\"Language is a Virus from Outer Space\\", a multi- media centenary celebration of satirical US writer William S Burroughs. Joe Elliott of Def Leppard made a guest appearance, duetting on \\"Suicide City\\". Bassist Stoner, who had been ill for some time, died a month after the reunion concert, and received an obituary in The Times newspaper citing his contributions to music.  2017: Album re-releases  In May 2017, Cherry Red Records released a comprehensive three-CD boxed set of the entire recorded works of the Doctors of Madness remastered, entitled Perfect Past - The Complete Doctors of Madness. The box set contained numerous bonus tracks, including an early version of \\"Out\\" and an out-take of \\"Doctors of Madness\\" from Figments of Emancipation, a previously-unheard \\"We Don't Get Back\\", a rehearsal version of Bob Dylan's \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", live recordings of songs the band never attempted in the studio, including those co-written with TV Smith of The Adverts, a prospective 1978 single made with Dave Vanian of The Damned, the unheard 1976 \\"Frustration\\" and an early version of \\"Don't Panic England\\".  2017-2019: Further performances and tours  The release of the Cherry Red three-CD box set was celebrated with a string of live performances by the band, featuring Richard \\"Kid\\" Strange, Urban Blitz, and the Japanese rhythm section of Susumu (bass) and Mackii (drums) from the band Sister Paul. This line-up toured in the UK and Japan. In November 2017 Strange and Urban Blitz, joined by protest singer Lily Bud, performed an evening of \\"Unplugged\\" Doctors of Madness songs in the neo-gothic chapel of The House of St Barnabas, in Soho, London. The event was filmed and released as a DVD, In The Afterglow. Strange occasionally tours in Japan, with the Japanese power duo Sister Paul taking bass and drum duties, and has also lectured students in Japan's Otaru University, Sapporo. He toured Japan with Sister Paul in September 2019.  2019: New Doctors of Madness album  In 2019, 42 years after recording Sons of Survival, Strange returned to the studio to record another album under the name 'Doctors of Madness'. The songs on the album were written by Strange in a short period of time, and were recorded at Doghouse Studios in Oxfordshire, England, with producer John Leckie, who had worked with Strange on the band's second album, Figments of Emancipation. The new album, entitled Dark Times, was released on 13 September 2019 on the Molecular Scream label through Cargo Records (except in North America, where it was to be released by Cherry Bomb/Mailboat Records). The \\"unashamedly political\\" album contained eight songs: \\"So Many Ways To Hurt You\\", \\"Make It Stop!\\", \\"Sour Hour\\", \\"Walk Of Shame\\", \\"This Kind Of Failure\\", \\"This Is How To Die\\", \\"Blood Brother\\" and \\"Dark Times\\". Guest musicians who participated in the recording of Dark Times included Joe Elliott of Def Leppard (vocals on five songs) and Sarah Jane Morris of the Communards (vocals on four songs). There were also contributions from Terry Edwards (Tindersticks, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Madness), Steve 'Boltz' Bolton (Paul Young, The Who, Atomic Rooster) and young protest singer Lily Bud. The Japanese power duo Sister Paul, comprising Susumu Ukei on bass and Mackii Ukei on drums, played on all eight tracks. The critical acclaim was unanimous. The record was released in the US on Cherry Bomb Records and in Japan via Crocus Records, and featured in end- of-year 'Top Albums of 2019' roundups.

Gameplay The player takes control of either Ruff or Tumble, a brother and sister who are sleeping and trying to free 40 \\"Winks\\" from a man named Nitekap and his accomplice, Threadbear. \\"Winks\\" are small, white creatures which make dreams, and \\"Hoodwinks\\", which are green and of a similar size are what are responsible for any nightmares. Throughout the game, the player can collect moon-shaped tokens, which are used to scream at dreamy apparitions, and Z-shaped tokens, which stop the player's character from waking up. Floating cogs are also collected to open doors, and in each of the three levels in each world, collect four dream keys to be placed on the clock face, in order to challenge the boss, before moving on to the next world. The character travels through dream worlds (Nightmare, Underwater, Space, Prehistoric, Castle, and Pirate). The player can also transform into various types of beings: Caveman, Robot, Jester (Ruff only), Fairy (Tumble only), and Ninja. Plot Nitekap, a bitter man deprived of sleep, decides to rid the world of good dreams by kidnapping small creatures known as \\"Winks\\", which are responsible for making good dreams. With the Winks kidnapped, Nitekap's minions known as \\"Hood-winks\\" are able to turn all good dreams into nightmares. Taking the role of Ruff or Tumble, the player must rescue all forty kidnapped Winks, which are imprisoned across six different \\"dream worlds\\". The player travels through each world and rescues the Winks along the way. At the end of each world, the player fights and defeats Nitekap's sidekick, an anthropomorphic teddy bear named Threadbear. After rescuing all forty Winks, Ruff and Tumble proceed to confront Nitekap himself. Nitekap sends Threadbear to stop them, but he is defeated once again. Threadbear accepts defeat and urges Nitekap to do the same, but Nitekap throws him out onto the streets, refusing to surrender. Threadbear tells Ruff and Tumble that Nitekap is unable to sleep due to a loud clock in his home. After Ruff and Tumble destroy the clock, Nitekap finally manages to sleep and feels very happy upon waking up in the morning. The game ends with Nitekap attempting to get rid of a Hood-wink.

Westermann (1922) classified it as one of the Togorestsprachen, a classification followed by Glottolog, while Heine (1968:300) leaves it unclassified.

A scion of the Georgian royal family Bagrationi, he was a brother of Pyotr Bagration, a notable Russian commander during the Napoleonic Wars. Son of Prince Ivan Aleksandrovich Bagration.  Career  Born in Kizlyar, Dagestan, Roman Bagration enrolled in the Chuguevsk Cossack regiment as an uryadnik (a Cossack NCO) at the age of 13 (1791). He saw his first action during the Persian Expedition of 1796 under Count Zubov and took part in the capture of Derbent. In 1802, he was commissioned in the Leib Guard Hussar regiment as a poruchik and fought against Napoleonic France during the 1805 War of the Third Coalition. At the request of his brother, Prince Bagration, he arrived, in 1806, in Georgia, to meet with a delegation of local nobility, which submitted him a petition expressing dissatisfaction with the Russian administration. Bagration was promptly recalled from Georgia, and sent to the army operating against the French in Prussia (1807).·Éë·Éê·Éí·É†·Éê·É¢·Éò·Éù·Éú·Éò, ·É†·Éù·Éõ·Éê·Éú (Bagration, Roman) in: ·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·É£·Éö·Éò ·É°·Éê·Éë·É≠·Éù·Éó·Éê ·Éî·Éú·É™·Éò·Éô·Éö·Éù·Éû·Éî·Éì·Éò·Éê (Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia), Vol. 2, p. 132.

During Napoleon's invasion of Russia (1812), he served in the 3rd Western Army and fought in the battles of Kobryn, Brest, and Gorodechno. For his valor in the Battle of Bautzen (1813), he received the rank of major general. He was then present at the sieges of Dresden, Hamburg, and Harburg (1813-1814). In the 1820s, he served in the Caucasus and took part in the wars against Turkey and Persia. He played a prominent role in the storming of Erivan, a Persian-held city of Armenia, in 1827 during the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), and was elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 1829. After the war, he settled in Tiflis where his mansion was frequented by the local elites and housed, in 1831, the first public performance of Woe from Wit, a play by Alexander Griboyedov, in which Bagration played the role of Colonel Skalozub. –§—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –∏ —Ñ–æ–ª—å–∫–ª–æ—Ä\\" (–§–≠–ë): –ò–ª—å–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –õ. \\"–ì–æ—Ä–µ –æ—Ç —É–º–∞\\" –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ü–µ–Ω–µ .

Biography  Hale was born in Colchester, England in 1797. He was self-taught although his grandfather, the educator William Cole, is believed to have tutored him. By 1827 he had obtained his first patent; he also won a first class Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in Paris for his paper on ship propulsion using an early form of jet propulsion. Hale was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 2004.  Rocketry  In 1844, Hale patented a new form of rotary rocket that improved on the earlier Congreve rocket design. Hale removed the guidestick from the design, instead vectoring part of the thrust through canted exhaust holes to provide rotation of the rocket, which improved its stability in flight. These rockets could weigh up to 60 pounds and were noted for their noise and glare on ignition. Hale rockets were first used by the United States Army in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848. Although the British Army experimented with Hale rockets during the Crimean War they did not officially adopt them until 1867.  References  *Frank H.

Henry Blunt, Archdeacon of St. Ogg's, in All Gas and Gaiters, late 1960s John Robertson Hare, OBE (17 December 1891 ‚Äì 25 January 1979) was an English actor, who came to fame in the Aldwych farces. He is remembered by modern audiences for his performances as the Archdeacon in the popular BBC sitcom, All Gas and Gaiters. Short in stature and of unheroic appearance, Hare made his stage career in character roles. From his early days as an actor he was cast as older men. One of his favourite parts, which he played in the provinces before achieving West End success, was \\"Grumpy\\", a retired lawyer, in which he toured before the First World War. After war service in the army, Hare got his big break. He was cast in a long-running farce with Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls. His meek and put-upon character was repeated in various incarnations in the eleven Aldwych farces presented by Walls between 1923 and 1933. He also appeared in film versions of most of the farces. After the Aldwych series came to an end, Hare continued to be cast in similar roles in new plays by Ben Travers and many others. Occasionally Hare took a break from farce, appearing in revue with Benny Hill and in a musical with Frankie Howerd. His final major role was on television in the late 1960s, as the Archdeacon of St Ogg's in the BBC comedy series All Gas and Gaiters. Life and career Early years Hare was born in Islington, London, the younger child and only son of Frank Homer Hare, an accountant, and his wife, Louisa Mary, n√©e Robertson.Midwinter, Eric. \\"Hare, (John) Robertson (1891‚Äì1979)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 12 February 2013 He was educated at Margate College in Kent and then studied drama with the actor and librettist Lewis Cairns James.Gaye, pp. 703‚Äì704 In 1911 Hare made his professional stage debut, playing the Duke of Gallminster in a provincial production of The Bear Leaders. The following year he made his London d√©but as one of the crowd in Gilbert Murray's version of Oedipus Rex at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In 1913 he had his first role in a West End production, as Kaufman in a detective play, The Scarlet Band, at the Comedy Theatre. He then toured the provinces for a number of years. His first leading part was the title role of Grumpy, by Horace Hodges and T. Wigney Percyval, which was one of his favourite roles.\\"Mr Robertson Hare\\", The Times, 16 November 1979, p. vi Even at this early stage of his career Hare was playing old men: \\"Grumpy\\" is an irascible retired lawyer.\\"Gaiety Theatre ‚Äì Grumpy, The Manchester Guardian, 26 October 1920, p. 14 In December 1915 he married (Alice) Irene Mewton (1890/91‚Äì1969); they had one daughter. Aldwych farce After war service with the army in France, Hare resumed his acting career, and came to the notice of the West End public as James Chesterman in a new farce, Tons of Money, in which he and the actor-manager Tom Walls played supporting roles, with Ralph Lynn in the lead.\\"Tons of Money\\", The Times, 15 April 1922, p. 10 The play ran for nearly two years, after which Walls recruited Lynn and Hare to join him in a series of new farces at the Aldwych Theatre. There were eleven plays in this series, which came to be known as Aldwych farces; they played continuously from 1923 to 1933.\\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 Hare played in them all; his roles were: William Smith (It Pays to Advertise); The Rev Cathcart Sloley-Jones (A Cuckoo in the Nest); Harold Twine (Rookery Nook); Hook (Thark); Oswald Veal (Plunder); Ernest Ramsbotham (A Cup of Kindness); Miles Tuckett (A Night Like This); Edwin Stoatt (Turkey Time); Clement Peck (Dirty Work); Montague Trigg (Fifty-Fifty); and Augustus Pogson (A Bit of a Test). His biographer, Eric Midwinter, writes of Hare's characters in these farces: Later years Hare appeared in films of most of the Aldwych farces, and played more than a dozen film roles in the post-war years. For the rest of his stage career he was usually cast in similar roles. After the last Aldwych farce in 1933 he played his customary types in more than twenty new farces over the next three decades. Among his most successful creations of this kind was Willoughby Pink in Travers's Banana Ridge in 1938, in which he played a British Empire builder with a dubious past. In 1947 he starred at the Apollo Theatre in She Wanted a Cream Front Door, 1954 saw him in the political farce The Party Spirit, while in 1956 was in John Dighton's Man Alive! at the Aldwych. The same year he appeared with Cicely Courtneidge in the long-running The Bride and the Bachelor at the Duchess Theatre. He made a few appearances in revue: his first was Fine Fettle (1959) in which he appeared with Benny Hill and Shani Wallis.\\"Benny Hill in a Musical Romp\\", The Times, 7 August 1959, p. 13 In 1963 Hare played in a long-running stage musical, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (762 performances), in which he was cast as Erronius to Frankie Howerd's Pseudolus.Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"A Funny Thing ... at the Strand\\", The Guardian, 4 October 1963, p. 9 In the 1960s Hare toured in Arsenic and Old Lace. In 1962 he briefly escaped type-casting, appearing with Wilfrid Hyde White in a comedy film Crooks Anonymous, in which he played an old lag, his familiar bald head disguised under a wig. In 1968 he joined Naunton Wayne in Oh, Clarence!, an adaptation of a P. G. Wodehouse Blandings novel, which he played in London, on tour in the provinces, and in South Africa. He reached a new public in the late 1960s in a television series, All Gas and Gaiters. He played the Archdeacon of St. Ogg's, the Ven Henry Blunt. His co-stars were William Mervyn as the Rt Rev Cuthbert Hever, Bishop of St Ogg's, Derek Nimmo as the Rev Mervyn Noote, the Bishop's chaplain, and John Barron as the Very Rev Lionel Pugh-Critchley, Dean of St Ogg's.Barron was succeeded in the role by Ernest Clark, but resumed the role later in the run of the programme. George Melly wrote: He was awarded the OBE in 1979. Hare died in London at the age of 87.

Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former being the most typical form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki). Today, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream sauce-tteokbokki, jajang- tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, galbi-tteokbokki and so on. Tteokbokki is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha (street stalls). There are also dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki (impromptu tteokbokki). It is also a popular home dish, as the rice cakes (garae-tteok) can be purchased in pre- packaged, semi-dehydrated form.  History  The first record on tteok-bokki appears in Siuijeonseo, a 19th century cookbook, where the dish was listed using the archaic spelling steokbokgi (). According to the book, tteok-bokki was known by various names including tteokjjim (steamed rice cakes), tteok- japchae (stir-fried rice cakes), and tteok-jeongol (rice cakes hot pot). The royal court version was made from white tteok (rice cakes), sirloin, sesame oil, soy sauce, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds, while the savory, soy sauce-based tteok-bokki was made in the head house of the Papyeong Yun clan, where high-quality soy sauce was brewed. In this version, ingredients such as short ribs were common. The name tteok- bokki also appears in the revised and enlarged edition of Joseon Yori Jebeop, where it is described as a soy sauce-based savory dish. It is believed that the spicy variant of tteok-bokki made with gochujang-based sauce first appeared in the 1950s. When Ma Bok Lim participated in the opening of a Chinese restaurant, she dropped tteok into hot sauce accidentally and ate it, and found that it was delicious. After that, she began selling it in Sindang and it has since become the most common variant of tteok-bokki. Today, the typical tteok-bokki purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) and pojangmacha (street stalls) are red and spicy, while the soy sauce-based, non- spicy version is referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (Í∂ÅÏ§ëÎñ°Î≥∂Ïù¥; \\"royal court tteok-bokki\\"). Rice tteok rose in popularity as the South Korean economy developed, and various versions of the dish have proliferated since. As it was once a working-class dish, wheat tteok was often substituted for rice tteok.  Varieties  Like other popular Korean dishes, tteok-bokki has seen numerous variations and fusions. Boiled eggs and pan-fried mandu (dumplings) were traditionally added to tteok-bokki. Ingredients such as seafood, short ribs, instant noodles, chewy noodles are also common additions to the dish.  Variations based on added ingredients  Haemul-tteok-bokki, (Ìï¥Î¨ºÎñ°Î≥∂Ïù¥; \\"seafood tteok-bokki\\") features seafood as its secondary ingredient. Galbi- tteok-bokki (Í∞àÎπÑÎñ°Î≥∂Ïù¥; \\"short rib tteok-bokki\\") features short ribs as its secondary ingredient. Ra-bokki (ÎùºÎ≥∂Ïù¥; \\"instant noodle tteok-bokki\\") and jol- bokki (Ï´ÑÎ≥∂Ïù¥; \\"chewy noodle tteok-bokki\\") are similar variants which add noodles to tteok-bokki. Ra-bokki adds ramyeon (ramen) noodles, and jjol-bokki adds chewy jjolmyeon wheat noodles.  Jeukseok-tteok-bokki  Jeongol (hot pot)-type tteok-bokki is called jeukseok-tteok-bokki (; \\"on-the-spot tteok- bokki\\"), and is boiled on a table-top stove during the meal. A variety of additions, such as vegetables, mandu (dumplings), and ramyeon or udong noodles are available at jeukseok-tteok-bokki restaurants. As jeukseok-tteok-bokki is usually a meal rather than a snack, it is often paired with bokkeum-bap (fried rice).  Variation based on sauce   Gochujang tteok-bokki  Piquant, red gochujang-based tteok-bokki is one of Korea's most popular snacks. While both soup-style gungmul-tteok-bokki (; \\"soup tteok-bokki\\") and dry gireum-tteok-bokki (; \\"oil tteok-bokki\\") are commonly enjoyed, the former is considered the de facto standard style. In gungmul-tteok-bokki, kelp- anchovy stock is often used to bring out the savory flavor. Gochugaru (chili powder) is often added for additional heat and color, while mullyeot (rice syrup) helps with sweetness and consistency. Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and diagonally sliced scallions are common additions to the dish. In gireum- tteok-bokki, the mixture of gochugaru, soy sauce, sugar or syrup, and sesame oil often replaces gochujang (chili paste). Soft tteok sticks are seasoned with the sauce mixture, then stir-fried in cooking oil with a handful of chopped scallions and served. Tongin Market in Jongno, Seoul is famous for its gireum-tteok-bokki. There are also many variations in gochujang tteok-bokki, such as a version that is season with perilla leaf.  Ganjang tteok-bokki  Gungjung-tteok-bokki Sweet and savory, brown soy sauce-based tteok-bokki is often referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (; \\"royal court tteok-bokki\\"). Its history dates back to a royal court dish before the introduction of chili pepper to the Korean peninsula in the mid-Joseon era (17th & 18th centuries). The earliest record of gungjung tteok-bokki is found in an 1800s cookbook called Siuijeonseo. Having a taste similar to japchae (stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables), it was enjoyed by the royals as a banchan and as a snack. Although traditional tteok-bokki was made with soup soy sauce, which is the traditional (and at the time, the only) type of soy sauce in pre-modern Korea, sweeter regular soy sauce has taken its place in modern times. Other traditional ingredients such as sirloin or short ribs, sesame oil, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds are still commonly used in modern gungjung-tteok-bokki. Other ingredients such as mung bean sprouts, carrots, onions, dried Korean zucchini, garlic, and shiitake mushrooms are also common. The dish is typically served with egg garnish.  Other variations  Gungmul (soup) tteok-bokki that are not based on either soy sauce or gochujang have also gained in popularity. There are some well- known variations. Curry tteok-bokki uses a yellow Korean-style curry base. It uses curry powder which includes turmeric, making it a healthier variation. Cream sauce tteok-bokki uses a base inspired by carbonara. Cream sauce and bacon are used instead of gochujang and fish cakes. Jajang'-tteok-bokki features a sauce based on jajang (sweet bean paste). Cheese tteok-bokki is a variant in which the tteok-bokki is either topped or stuffed with cheese. It is sold in snack bars and can also easily be made at home. Depending on personal preference, it can be eaten with seasonings such as green tea powder, herb powder, sesame, or parsley.  Gireum and gyeran tteok-bokki  Gireum tteok-bokki (; \\"oil tteok-bokki\\") is a variety of tteok-bokki that is stir-fried in oil and served with little or no sauce. This style is most famously found in Seoul's Tongin Market, where visitors can buy vendor coins, which in turn can be used to purchase food from various vendors around the market. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who visited Korea in February 2014, sampled gireum tteok-bokki at the Tongin Market. Gyeran tteok-bokki (Í≥ÑÎûÄÎñ°Î≥∂Ïù¥; \\"egg tteok-bokki\\") is another variation which features no sauce. Only tteok (rice cakes), eggs, vegetables and seasonings (primarily salt) are used. It differs from gireum tteok-bokki in that it is not spicy.  Brand  As Koreans enjoy tteokbokki very much, there are many tteokbokki brands in Korea.  Yeopgi Tteokbokki  The full name is 'Dongdaemoon Yeopgi Tteokbokki.' The brand was founded in 2002 and features a strong and spicy taste. Rice cakes, long fish cakes, cheese, and sausages are the main ingredients. Recently, the toppings that can be added to this have become very diverse. Examples include cheese, eggs, glass noodles, ham, bacon, etc. There is also a side menu to eat with tteokbokki. For example, there are seaweed roll, fried vegetables, hotdogs, steamed eggs, rice balls, sundae and cheese sticks. The spiciness can be adjusted according to individual tastes, and there are a total of five stages.  Sinjeon Tteokbokki  Sinjeon Tteokbokki was first established in Daegu in 1999, and as of January 2020, there are more than 670 franchises in Korea. Sinjeon Tteokbokki also has its own museum. There are regular tteokbokki and cheese tteokbokki. There are 15 kinds of fried foods, one of the side menus. There are also various kinds of rice, and 'Sinjeon Cheese Gimbap' is famous.

The town had been captured by the Jacobite army that invaded England in November 1745 and reached as far south as Derby, before turning back on 6 December. They re-entered Carlisle on 19 December; leaving a garrison of 400 men, the main army continued its retreat into Scotland the next day. Advance elements of the government army reached Carlisle on 21 December, but siege operations were delayed until their heavy artillery arrived six days later. They commenced firing on 28 December, and the Jacobites surrendered on 30th; 384 prisoners were taken, some of whom were later executed and many others sentenced to transportation to the West Indies. Background The Jacobites crossed into England on 8 November and reached Carlisle on 10th. Previously an important border fortress, its defences had been neglected since the 1707 Union but it remained a formidable challenge for the Jacobites, who had no siege equipment. They insisted on the surrender of both town and castle, threatening to burn them if not; although Jacobite officer O'Sullivan later admitted this was a bluff, Carlisle capitulated on 15 November. Leaving a garrison of 100 men under Colonel John Hamilton to hold the castle, the army continued south. After turning back from Derby on 6 December, the Jacobites reached Carlisle on 19 December and after considerable discussion, continued into Scotland on 20th, leaving a garrison of around 400. It is generally agreed Prince Charles did so to demonstrate his determination to return, but its wisdom was almost unanimously condemned, both at the time and by historians since. One Jacobite officer, James Johnstone, later recorded he refused an order to remain with the garrison, as he 'would never be a victim by choice.' The siege Despite years of neglect, Carlisle Castle remained a formidable obstacle Hamilton commanded the castle, with the town held by Colonel Francis Towneley, colonel of the Jacobite Manchester Regiment, the only significant unit recruited in England. He held a commission in the French army from 1728 to 1736, which had been renewed in 1744, and the Jacobite cavalry officer Sir John MacDonald viewed him as having \\"the greatest intelligence and prudence\\" of those on Prince Charles' staff. This opinion was not universally shared; he had a reputation for being hot-tempered and one of his subordinates James Bradshaw transferred to another unit, rather than continue serving under him. Government records show that of the 396 prisoners taken when the garrison surrendered, 114 were English members of the Manchester Regiment, 274 were Scots, mostly from Lowland units like Glenbuckets' and Lord Ogilvie's regiments, while 8 were French. The Duke of Newcastle later suggested the garrison was made up of 'the worst of their troops;' many of the Manchester recruits were unarmed, while a subsequent inventory showed most of the 46 pieces of artillery available were unused, as the defenders had plenty of powder but very little ammunition. On 21 December, advance elements of Cumberland's army arrived outside the town; over the next few days, their numbers increased to over 5,000, including a contingent from Newcastle under George Wade. In their attempts to catch up with the retreating Jacobites, the heavy guns had been left at Lichfield and Cumberland was forced to wait for additional artillery to be brought up; meanwhile, his troops blockaded the town and began constructing gun positions. An 18 pounder cannon, similar to those used by William Belford to fire on the castle Taking even a rundown fort was not easy, a fact acknowledged by Cumberland, who wanted to prosecute the civic officials who surrendered the town to the Jacobites in November, despite their complete lack of siege equipment. The Duke of Richmond, grandson of Charles II and one of Cumberland's officers, wrote to Newcastle on 24 December predicting the capture of Carlisle would take some time. Towneley reinforced the defences and his men fired 'upon every body who has shown himself;' while this did little damage, it demonstrated an assault would face determined resistance. The first battery of siege guns arrived on 25 December; more arrived on 27th from Whitehaven, along with 70-80 naval gunners under William Belford, an experienced artillery specialist who served under Cumberland in Flanders. On 28th, they began firing on the castle and apart from a short pause caused by shortage of ammunition, continued until the morning of 30 December, when Hamilton offered to surrender. In contests between regular armies, the garrison would have surrendered on terms, which at the minimum meant being treated as prisoners of war; as rebels, Cumberland only granted their lives, subject to the 'King's pleasure' ie they would not be summarily executed but receive a trial. Towneley opposed surrender and felt they could have held out for better terms; he was over ruled and the garrison capitulated on the afternoon of 30 December. Aftermath Lovat (front), Towneley and Hamilton Due to fears of a possible French invasion of south- East England, Cumberland returned to London, sending Henry Hawley to Edinburgh. His immediate objective was to secure Lowland Scotland but an attempt to lift the siege of Stirling Castle was defeated at Falkirk Muir on 17 January. The Jacobites were unable to follow up their victory and retreated to Inverness on 1 February; the rebellion ended on 16 April with defeat at Culloden. Two Irish officers, Captains Brown and Maxwell, escaped over the walls and made their way to Scotland. Prince Charles at first refused to believe their report but the loss of nearly 400 men for little gain placed further strain on the already poor relationship between him and his Scottish officers. Most of the Carlisle garrison were initially held in a dungeon in the castle without food or water for several days; in January, nearly 200 were transferred to York Castle, where they joined 80 prisoners taken at Clifton Moor. 27 members of the Manchester Regiment were executed, including nine officers who were hanged, drawn and quartered in London on 30 July 1746; they included Towneley, whose argument he was a French officer was rejected by the court. Hamilton, along with a number of others including James Bradshaw and Sir John Wedderburn, was executed on 28 November. In all, 3,471 Jacobite prisoners were indicted for treason; in addition to those from the Manchester Regiment, 93 suffered death, including 40 recaptured British army deserters. 33 of these executions were carried out between October and November 1746 at Harraby Hill outside Carlisle, most of whom are thought to have been members of the garrison. Of the remainder, 650 died awaiting trial, 900 pardoned and the rest transported; the 1747 Act of Indemnity pardoned any remaining prisoners, among them Flora MacDonald. One of those captured at Carlisle was Richard Riding, an 24 year old unemployed weaver who joined the Manchester Regiment in November 1745; in May 1747, he was one of 150 Jacobites transported to the West Indies. En route, the ship was taken by a French privateer and the prisoners released in the French colony of Martinique; some eventually made their way home, others went on to North America but the majority disappear from the historical record, including Riding.

The largest conventional-cab truck ever produced by General Motors, the product line was introduced for 1977, replacing the C/M 90/9500 trucks. After 1981, the Chevrolet Bison was discontinued, following the withdrawal of Chevrolet heavy-truck production. In 1986, General Motors entered a joint venture with Volvo to produce heavy trucks, leading GMC to end production of the General conventional and Astro cabover in 1987. As of 2020 production, the 1987 GMC General and Brigadier are the final Class 8 conventional-cab trucks produced by General Motors. The GMC General and Chevrolet Bison were assembled in Pontiac, Michigan at Pontiac East Assembly (alongside the Chevrolet Bruin and GMC/WhiteGMC Brigadier).  Background  In 1966, GMC Truck and Coach introduced its first dedicated heavy-duty trucks, moving away from trucks adapted from the smaller C/K line. The division introduced two lines using a common cab, the H/J-Series (93-inch BBC) and the C/M-Series (112-inch BBC). Using a longer hood, the C/M-series trucks were designed to accommodate larger diesel engines, such as the Cummins NH and Cummins V903, and the Detroit Diesel 8V71. The center-hinged \\"butterfly\\" hood of the H/J-series was replaced on the C/M by a front-hinged fiberglass hood. Following the introduction of the medium-duty C/K in 1973, the 112-inch BBC truck was consolidated to the M-Series. During 1977 and 1978, GMC Truck and Coach further split its heavy- duty truck range. The Chevrolet M90/GMC M9500 were replaced by the Chevrolet Bison and GMC General in 1977, with the H/J range renamed the Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Brigadier in 1978.  Design overview  1984 GMC General dashboard Similar in layout to the Ford LTL-9000, International Harvester Transtar 4300, and Mack Super-Liner, the Chevrolet Bison and GMC General are Class 8 conventional trucks. Produced with an all-aluminum cab built by Budd, the trucks were available in many different combinations. Two hood configurations were offered (108-inch or 116-inch BBC); along with a day cab, a 34-inch sleeper cab was offered, along with a walk-in sleeper cab (introduced in 1985). While no gasoline engines were available, several diesel powerplants were available, with the Detroit Diesel 6-71 (later replaced by the 6V92) as the standard engine. Alongside the 6-71, a buyer could choose the Cummins N-series, or Detroit Diesel 8V71 and 8V92. Following its introduction in the GMC Astro, the Caterpillar 3406 was introduced in 1982. When introduced in 1977, the Bison/General were available from dealers as vehicle gliders. Essentially a complete truck with the exception of the engine, transmission, and rear axles, the incomplete vehicles were designed for a dual purpose: to either reinstall an existing powertrain in a new truck or to allow for further customization not available from a dealership.  Discontinuation  Following the launch of the product line, the GMC General quickly overtook the Chevrolet Bison in sales and market share. In 1981, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan. A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of product support by Chevrolet dealers. In contrast to other GM brands, a key requirement of GMC franchisees of the time was the ability to sell and service the entire GMC product line. In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, the GMC motorhome, P-chassis, and school bus chassis. For a typical dealership, this meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars. In 1986, Volvo AB entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo taking an 85% stake. Having acquired White Motor Company in 1980, the joint venture would do business as Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, selling trucks under the combined WhiteGMC product badge. Under the joint venture, GMC trucks were phased out in favor of White-designed Volvo GM products. In 1987, the final GMC General was produced, followed by the Brigadier in 1988 (badged as a WhiteGMC); the withdrawal of the latter marked the exit of General Motors from the Class 8 truck segment. Following the GMC General, Volvo GM produced the WhiteGMC WC/WI Class 8 conventional, introduced in 1980 as the White Road Boss 2, the model line was produced through 2000 in various forms as a White, WhiteGMC, Autocar, and Volvo.

Gr√•sten Palace () is located at Gr√•sten in the Jutland region of southern Denmark. It is best known for being the summer residence of the Danish Royal Family. The main house has a modern, all-white facade, with Venetian doors opening onto sweeping, manicured lawns and gravel walkways. The grounds include a huge stables court. History Gr√•sten was in its first edition a small hunting castle built in the middle of the 16th century. The south wing of the present-day main house is believed to be built on the site of the second structure, that was built in 1603 to replace a hunting lodge which had been destroyed in a fire in the middle of the 16th century.Gr√•sten Palace Palaces and Properties Agency After about three and a half succeeding centuries of ownership by Danish nobles, Gr√•sten Slot was taken over by the State, extensively restored, and by 1935, it was the summer residence for then-Crown Prince Frederik, later King Frederik IX, and Crown Princess Ingrid, later Queen Ingrid, who adored the palace until her death in November 2000. It is the usual venue for the royal family's official summer photo shoot. In November 1845, Hans Christian Andersen visited Duke Christian August II at Gr√•sten Castle. Legend had it that Gr√•sten Palace was where Andersen wrote The Little Match Girl, during his visit. However that is not the case. Andersen wrote it when he visited Augustenborg Palace. Landscape and Palace Chapel  The estate area has an area of 6.6 km¬≤ (2.5 mile¬≤). The property includes a stables court, manicured lawns, and gravel walkways. Graasten Palace Chapel in the north wing is the only building remaining from the original baroque palace after a 1757 fire. Despite a badly damaged interior from the Second Schleswig War, the chapel is decorated with 80 paintings. The chapel has bilingual congregations, with German and Danish services to accommodate the mix of local culture.

Known for his opposition in the German Democratic Republic, he became Minister for Disarmament and Defense in the last cabinet. He is now a member of the CDU. The erection of the Berlin Wall forced him to drop out of the school he had attended in West Berlin in 1961 and he was forbidden from taking his Abitur exams in the East for refusing to join the Free German Youth movement. He then worked as an assistant to a roofer before doing a job training for bricklayer. He is a pacifist. In 1966, for refusing both regular service and Bausoldat (construction soldier in the National People's Army), he was arrested by the Stasi, and put into prison for eight months where he was tortured, abused and brutally beaten. Later, he studied Theology at the theological school in Berlin, an education he completed in 1974 with two exams. He then worked as a Lutheran pastor in Berlin- Friedrichshain and took part in the opposition, such as being the editor of samizdat publications with Thomas Welz. It has been claimed that during this period Eppelmann had contact with the CIA.Paragraph 6 of \\"DDR-Opposition bis 1989\\"Middle of \\"Ein Blick zur√ºck\\" In 1990, Eppelmann was one of the founding fathers of the Democratic Awakening, becoming its president. Thus, he took an active part in the round table of 1990, preparing the German reunification. From 18 March 1990 to 2 October 1990 (when it ceased to exist) he was a member of the Volkskammer. He became a Minister in the cabinet of Hans Modrow and later in the one of Lothar de Maizi√®re. When the Democratic Awakening joined the Christian Democratic Union in August 1990, Eppelmann became a member and, later, the assisting chairman of the worker's division of the CDU, the CDA. He was a member of the Bundestag from 1990 to 2005 for the Christian Democratic Union. Then, he was chairman of the commission that coped with the history of the German Democratic Republic. Eppelmann's trademark is his \\"Berliner Schnauze\\", an idiom that is supposed to bring him close to the people of Berlin. He is married and has five children.

It is the second remake of Paramount's earlier Shanghai Express (1932), remade as Night Plane from Chungking (1943) and the first film to be set in the newly emerged People's Republic of China (PRC). It was directed by William Dieterle and produced by Hal B. Wallis, from a screenplay by John Meredyth Lucas, based on the original screenplay by Jules Furthman and Harry Hervey. The film stars Joseph Cotten, Corinne Calvet and Edmund Gwenn with Marvin Miller. Peking Express is notable for its production values. The music score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, the cinematography was by Charles Lang, the art direction by Franz Bachelin and Hal Pereira and the costume design by Edith Head. Plot Doctor Michael Bachlin (Joseph Cotten), is in Shanghai investigating a missing shipment of medical supplies for the United Nation's World Health Organization. He must travel to Peking on the express train with other passengers, Father Joseph Murray (Edmund Gwenn), and Kwon (Marvin Miller), a mysterious businessman. Just before the train leaves, Kwon's son, Ti Shen (Robert W. Lee), attempts to board, but his mother, Li Eiu (Soo Yong), has him arrested by Nationalist agents, before boarding the train herself. Another passenger is nightclub singer and former lover, Danielle Grenier (Corinne Calvet) who Michael met earlier in Paris. Kwon invites her and Michael to join him in the dining car. Father Murray gets into an argument with a reporter, Wong (Benson Fong), an ardent Communist who also clashes with Michael. Danielle tells Michael after they broke up, she married but her husband died a year after. Li Eiu who shares Danielle's compartment is found beaten by her husband. The next day, when the train stops to pick up soldiers, Kwon passes a message to a vendor. Michael wants to resume their romance but Danielle hesitates, saying she has been involve with too many others. Li Eiu is discovered with a knife wound, although Kwon claims she attempted suicide, but Michael is suspicious after seeing her beating. Forced to halt by a blocked rail line, the train is attacked by counter- revolutionary forces with the soldiers on board surrendering, but summarily shot. Michael, Danielle, Murphy and Wong learn Kwon is the attackers' leader who has the passengers driven to a nearby farm house. Kwon, once a Communist, now deals in the black market, including stealing precious medical supplies Michael is trying to recover. Kwon knows Michael is going to Peking to treat a high-ranking general. Kwon forces Michael to contact Peking offering to release the train and its passengers in exchange for this son being freed. Michael arranges for Kwon's son to be flown to the farm hideout. Complicating matters, Danielle confesses to Michael she was a spy and her late husband was a Communist. The arrangement for release of the hostage and train is dependent on Peking bringing Ti Shen, without the aircraft being following to Kwon's base. When Wong confronts Kwon about his treachery, the reporter is tortured with his hands burned with a poker. After Ti Shen arrives, the pilot radios Peking that he will leave at dawn with Michael, but Kwon shoots and kills the pilot, reneging on the deal. Michael treats Wong's wounds, and tells Ti Shen his father has tried to kill his mother who has been frightened by her husband's actions and his influence over Ti Shen. Kwon wants Danielle for himself, sending Michael and Father Murray back to the train. Li Eiu confronts her husband, stabbing Kwon, before succumbing to her own wounds. Before dying, she begs her son to help Michael and the others escape. Under guard by Father Murray, Michael brings Ti Shen with him and tries to find Danielle, who has already returned to the farmhouse. Michael ties up Ti Shen, returns to Kwon's base, shooting two guards and taking Danielle away. At the train, Wong joins two soldiers in a jeep, and throws a hand grenade, which wounds Father Murray. Michael returns fire with a machine gun, killing the attackers. As the train gathers speed, more soldiers are in pursuit, but Ti Shen decides to help Michael, firing at the soldiers but is shot. As he dies, he reveals where the stolen medicine shipment can be found. Michael, Danielle and Father Murray are finally able to make good their escape.

Overview The songs on the album are regarded as the finest written by Bunny Wailer, and explore themes such as repatriation (\\"Dreamland\\"), and his arrest for marijuana possession (\\"Fighting Against Conviction\\", originally titled \\"Battering Down Sentence\\").Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (1999) Reggae: 100 Essential CDs, Rough Guides, \\"This Train\\" is very loosely based on the American gospel standard of the same name. The album features some of Jamaica's leading musicians and also contributions from Bob Marley and Peter Tosh of The Wailers on backing vocals, and the Wailers rhythm section of Carlton and Aston Barrett on some of the tracks. The origins of the album title goes back to Wailer's childhood in the Jamaican countryside, where he grew up in the same village as his friend Bob Marley. Wailer said: Bunny Wailer himself considers Blackheart Man to be his best solo album. As he told Jamaican newspaper The Daily Gleaner in June 2009: This is one of the three Wailers solo albums released in 1976, along with Peter Tosh's album Legalize It and Bob Marley's Rastaman Vibration. The album was listed in the 1999 book The Rough Guide: Reggae: 100 Essential CDs.  Release history  The original LP release of the album was released in two different mixes. The international mix is what is most widely available and has appeared on CD. The Jamaican mix has longer versions of songs and different overdubs. In particular, the Jamaican mix of This Train lasts a full minute longer. Although the Jamaican mix has not appeared on CD, it remains a favorite amongst reggae aficionados. The album has been released on compact disc several times; first in 1989 on Mango Records, then in 2002 on Island in a remastered edition.

It depicts the plight of Jewish refugees after World War II that contributed to the creation of the State of Israel. The film's emphasis is on the pitiful conditions for Jewish refugees in Europe after the war, as antisemitism was still rife and poverty was common. It also shows how emigration to the British Mandate of Palestine became a goal for many, but that British immigration rules often resulted in them being detained in camps in Cyprus. The eventual formation of the State of Israel is then shown, with emphasis on the debates in the White House between Palestinian Jews, President Harry S. Truman, and the United Nations. The Long Way Home is narrated by Morgan Freeman and features the voices of Edward Asner, Sean Astin, Martin Landau, Miriam Margolyes, David Paymer, Nina Siemaszko, Helen Slater, and Michael York.

It was sung by Asha Bhosle and chorus. The song was picturized on Zeenat Aman. It was written by Anand Bakshi and composed by Rahul Dev Burman. It has been remixed and sampled by many other artists. The song was a hit in the 1970s, and gained cult status in India. Personnel The song was originally intended to be a duet, with Lata Mangeshkar singing for the \\"good girl\\", and Usha Iyer (later Usha Uthup) singing for the \\"bad girl\\". However, due to some changes, the song ended up being a solo sung by Asha Bhosle. The sound aa..aa..aa.. at the end of each stanza is that of Usha Iyer, who also chants Hare Krishna Hare Rama with the chorus. The song presented the lyricist Anand Bakshi as a versatile lyricist and shaped his career. It also boosted the composer Rahul Dev Burman's career. Bhupinder played the guitar for the song. Charanjit Singh played the distinctive drone of the transichord that opens the song. Charts and reviews The song topped the Binaca Geetmala annual list 1972. In Binaca Geetmala, a song could appear for a maximum of 18 weeks, after which it was called a Sartaj Geet. On 15 March 1972, Dum Maro Dum became a Sartaj Geet while it was at #1 payddan (position). It had remained at #1 position for 12 weeks. Daniel Shiman, a reviewer wrote about the song, \\"It's a montage of creaking synthesizers, psychedelic guitars, and, of course, vocals nailed by Asha Bhosle in an ear-piercing exposition of sound.\\" Kishore Kumar once said that the song is powerful enough to bring a dead person to life. Picturization The song was picturized in Kathmandu. It shows Janice (Zeenat Aman) in her hippie attire, smoking cannabis or hashish and swaying under the effect of the herbs while hypnotically crooning the \\"Dum Maro Dum\\", encouraging one to 'take another toke'. She dances with a look of ecstasy on her face. Later in the movie, Dev Anand replies to the song by singing Ram Ka Naam Badnaam Na Karo (\\"Do not desecrate the name of Rama\\"), sung by Kishore Kumar. Other versions The song has been remixed and sampled by a number of artists. It has also been included in many compilations. Dev Anand did not include the complete version of Dum Maro Dum in Hare Rama Hare Krishna, as he was worried the song would overshadow the film. Usha Uthup (who sang the song \\"I Love You\\" with Asha Bhosle in Hare Rama Hare Krishna) has performed the song many times. British DJ, San-j Sanj has used the infectious guitar hook and created a dance track featuring Natty A called \\"So Real So Right\\". DJ Ritu and Bally Sagoo compiled the song for their collection The Rough Guide to Bollywood in 2002. In 2004, the hip-hop artist Method Man sampled the song in his third album Tical 0: The Prequel, for the track \\"What's Happenin'\\" featuring Busta Rhymes. It was featured in the 2003 Bollywood movie Boom, where Zeenat Aman once again sings and dances to Dum Maro Dum. The song was re-recorded for the album You've Stolen My Heart (August 2005) by Kronos Quartet and Asha Bhosle. The album was a tribute to Rahul Dev Burman. The song was also featured in the soundtrack to the 2005 video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Dum Maro Dum has been covered by Soul Funk Band Botown on the album 'The Soul of Bollywood'. Like the original, Botown's version was recorded completely live. It builds on the original's psychedelic soul leanings with a hypnotic laid-back groove. The song has recently been covered by Indian film enthusiasts \\"The Knockouts\\", from Luton, England, on their 4-track EP, The Remarkable Sounds of India. The Knockouts, who usually record lo-fi garage punk/surf instrumentals, have, for this release only, engaged the services of fellow Asha fan, Mick Sheridan, who has lived for several years in India. The iconic song has also been remixed as an item song and picturized on Deepika Padukone in the Hindi film Dum Maaro Dum.

The second generation of the H/J-series heavy-duty conventionals, the Brigadier was produced from 1978 to 1989.Meyer, p. 37 https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical- brochures/GMC/100_YR_GMC_HISTORY_MAR09.pdf Slotted between the largest medium- duty C/K trucks and the GMC General, the Brigadier was a Class 7-8 short-hood conventional similar to the Ford L-Series and Mack Model R. Configured in both straight truck and semi-tractor layouts, the Brigadier saw use in short-haul, vocational, and severe-service applications. All examples were assembled alongside medium-duty GM trucks and GM RTS buses at the GMC Truck & Coach Pontiac Central Assembly facility in Pontiac, Michigan. From 1978 to 1981, Chevrolet marketed the Brigadier as the nearly identical Chevrolet Bruin. Following the launch of Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, the Brigadier was marketed under the combined WhiteGMC branding through the 1989 model year.  Background  In 1966, General Motors split its heavy-duty trucks further apart from medium-duty models, giving them a distinct chassis and ending the use of the cab from the C/K-series pickup truck. The 1966 H/J-series (H=single; J=tandem) was designed with a model-specific 93-inch BBC cab and chassis. Alongside GMC V6 and Chevrolet 427 V8 gasoline engines, the H/J trucks were available with Cummins, Detroit Diesel, and Caterpillar diesel engines. The H/J-Series formed the basis of the C(later N)/M-series trucks; using a longer 114-inch BBC to accommodate larger diesel engines). In 1977, the N/M-series was replaced by the Class 8 Chevrolet Bison/GMC General semitractor. From 1966 to 1970, GMC would use a separate conventional school bus chassis from Chevrolet, basing it on the H6500 instead of the medium-duty Chevrolet C60 (in 1971, GMC would return to a medium-duty chassis).  Design overview  GMC Brigadier semitractor In the mid-1970s, General Motors began shifting away from its alphanumeric nomenclature for truck names. While still using the H/J name internally, the redesign brought new names to the vehicles. Chevrolet rebranded the H/J series as the Chevrolet Bruin, adopting a range of \\"frontier\\" nameplates for its truck range (Bison, Bruin, Kodiak, Blazer, Silverado, Scottsdale, Cheyenne). For its heavy trucks, GMC adopted a military-related nomenclature, with the H/J series becoming the Brigadier, joining the General and TopKick (a slang term). GMC introduced the Brigadier in a 9500 series; an 8000 series was introduced for 1979. Chevrolet offered the Bruin in 70, 80, and 90-series. While tilting-hood examples are nearly identical between brands, butterfly-hood versions are distinguished by their headlight configurations (Bruins have two headlights; Brigadiers have four).  Chassis/body  The Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Brigadier carried over the H/J 9500 cab introduced in 1966, but with a number of changes. Replacing the removable steel hood is a fully tilting fiberglass hood with a larger rectangular grille; the larger hood features a redesigned radiator, featuring better engine cooling. For durability, the previous-generation center-hinged \\"butterfly\\" hood remains available. While produced with an optional cab airfoil, the cab is sold with either a one-piece or a two-piece windshield. The Chevrolet 427 gasoline V8 would be the standard engine for the Bruin/Brigadier. In 1982, the Brigadier became powered exclusively by diesel engines. Alongside the Detroit Diesel 6V53, 6V71, 6-71, 8V71, and 6V92, the Caterpillar 3208 were used alongside the Cummins NTC diesels. In 1984, the Cummins L10 was introduced as an option.  Discontinuation  1980s GMC Brigadier in use as fire engine Following the launch of the product line, the GMC Brigadier quickly overtook the Chevrolet Bruin in sales and market share. After the 1981 model year, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan. A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of product support by Chevrolet dealers. In contrast to Chevrolet (and other General Motors brands), GMC required all franchisees to sell and service the GMC product line in its entirety. In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, P-chassis, the GMC Motorhome, and all bus chassis. For a GMC dealership, this requirement meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars. In 1986, Volvo AB entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo holding an 85% stake. To reflect the 1980 acquisition of White Motor Company by Volvo, the products of Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation were marketed under the combined WhiteGMC product nomenclature. While the slow- selling GMC General and Astro were discontinued, Volvo GM initially continued production of the Brigadier. For 1988 production, Volvo GM re-released the Brigadier as a WhiteGMC (the only GMC truck produced under the joint venture). Along with revisions to the badging, a sloped hood became an option (sharing its grille with the GMC TopKick). The WhiteGMC Brigadier was produced through the end of the 1989 model year, marking the retirement of the GM H/J chassis after 23 years. For WhiteGMC, the role of the short-hood Class 8 conventional was adopted by the WG series, slotted below the WIL/WCL (replacing the GMC General); all WhiteGMC conventionals were evolutions of the White Road Boss series. For 1990, General Motors redesigned its medium-duty C/K trucks for the first time since 1973, adopting the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick branding for the model lines. In 1997, the 8500-series TopKick was introduced, marking the first Class 8 truck produced by GM since 1989.

The DSCSC was formerly known as the Sri Lanka Army Command and Staff College (ACSC). The Commandant is a two-star appointment and the current Commandant of the DSCSC is Major General Jeewaka Ruwan Kulatunga RSP ndc psc.Cof N addresses the Student Officers of Defence Services Command and Staff College Objectives The above aim is met through addressing six principal objectives, which are as follows: * Know and be able to apply the functions and techniques of staff in war and peace. * Know and apply the principles and techniques involved in the employment of land forces in particular, and armed forces in general, in all types of military operations. * Analyze the function of command up to and including divisional level. * Know the structure, deployment, roles and interdependence of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. * Understand how the Sri Lankan defence policy is formulated and the relationship with military doctrine. * Analyze those issues in national and international affairs, which influence the defence policies of Sri Lanka and her allies. History Army Command and Staff College  Since the establishment of the Ceylon Army in 1949, mid career staff officers were sent to the British Army Staff College, Camberley and later to the 1960s to the Indian Army Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, as well as other overseas staff colleges. With the rapid espantion of the army during the Sri Lankan Civil War, the need for more 'Staff Qualified' officers was felt as the army began mounting multi-division military operations. As a response to this need the army established the Army Command and Staff College (ACSC) on 16 March 1998 with the first course consisting of 26 Student Officers. However, the College was officially inaugurated on 28 August 1998 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the request of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Rohan Daluwatte. At the inception, a British Army Training Team consisting of two Lieutenant Colonels was attached, in order to assist the faculty to formulate a curriculum similar to the British Joint Services Command and Staff College, but with emphasis on local requirements providing required training material and fine tuning the local faculty's teaching skills. The faculty was driven through an ‚Äòon the job‚Äô Training Programme. The ACSC was established with the aim of developing the professional knowledge and understanding of selected Student Officers both in command and on staff duties, for the Sri Lanka Army. However, a few selected Student Officers from the Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force too were trained on Army Command and Staff aspects from ACSC Course No 1 onwards. During the 9 years of ACSC (1998-2006), the College produced 253 graduates, of whom 207 were from the Army, 22 were from the Navy, 21 from the Air Force and one from the Police. This was in contrast to 58 ‚ÄòStaff Qualified Graduates‚Äô available in the Sri Lanka Army, in the year 1996. The change from ACSC to DSCSC could be perceived as an indication shown from the very inception on the importance of a Joint Services atmosphere. Moreover, the efforts of all military arms was felt imperative to be joint, in order to combat the adversary. Furthermore, changing tactics of adversaries compelled the military to revise its doctrines in war fighting, thus setting conditions for a sound ‚ÄòJoint environment‚Äô. Defence Services Command and Staff College On 22 January 2007, ACSC was re-designated as the Defence Services Command and Staff College, where all military doctrinal and strategic level planning and teachings were brought under one roof with Secretary to the President, Lalith Weeratunga serving as the Chief Guest. he first Commandant of DSCSC was Major General N A Ranasinghe RSP, VSV, USP, ndc, psc, Isc. DSCSC Course No 1 commenced immediately after the inauguration ceremony with 36 Student Officers from the Army, 8 Student Officers from the Navy and 10 Student Officers from the Air Force registering for the first course. The Student Officers from respective Services are functioning under three wings namely Army, Navy and Air, with greater emphasis on Joint Environment. The Course The Defence Services Command and Staff Course sets out to train officers in basic command and staff techniques, but just as important, it aims to develop the intellectual attributes to cope with their future appointments and the changes that are inevitable in the years ahead. By this process we seek to develop their breadth of understanding and their ability to analyse and evaluate issues in a logical sequence. The training course at the DSCSC runs for a duration of 11 months. The course is meant for Army, Navy and air force field/senior officers in the ranks of Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, Squadron Leader and Wing Commander. Officers who are recommended by their Regiment sand services for the course have to sit for a competitive entrance examination, after which a board of senior officers make final selections. Upon completion of the Defence Services Command and Staff Course, officers can use the post nominal letters psc. Student officers who gain psc can opt to gained a Master of Science in Defence and Strategic Studies if they have gained a Grade C and above for the subjects stipulated as Common and Wing Specific and in any two subjects excluding Commandant‚Äôs Research Paper.

The largest cabover trucks ever produced by GM, the Titan (and more common Astro) were introduced for 1969, replacing the 1960-1968 GMC \\"Crackerbox\\" COEs. The Astro and Titan would become the final trucks of the type assembled and marketed by General Motors, following the 1981 exit of Chevrolet from heavy truck sales and the 1986 creation of the Volvo GM joint venture. The Chevrolet Titan and GMC Astro were assembled at Pontiac Truck & Coach/Truck & Bus (Pontiac East Assembly) in Pontiac, Michigan, with the final GMC Astro produced in 1987.  Background  1959 GMC \\"Crackerbox\\" (with sleepercab) In 1959, GMC introduced its Class 8 cabover trucks, replacing the previous \\"Cannonball\\" fixed-cab COEs. Distinguished by its boxy appearance, it became nicknamed the \\"Crackerbox\\". Available in a 48-inch BBC (bumper to back of cab) length, the truck was produced with an all-aluminum fully tilting cab. Alongside a 702 cubic-inch GMC V12 gasoline engine, the truck was available with Detroit Diesel 6V71 and 8V71 diesels. Along with single or tandem axle configurations, the GMC \\"Crackerbox\\" was available with a sleeper cab. In the late 1960s, as American truck manufacturers introduced updated designs for cabover trucks, design work began on an all-new Class 8 cabover. Expanding the product line to the Chevrolet brand, the replacement for the GMC Crackerbox sought to expand interior space, visibility, and driver ergonomics. For the 1969 model year, the GMC F was replaced by the GMC Astro, while the Chevrolet Titan 90 was unveiled for the 1970 model year.See brochure See brochure  Design overview  1985 GMC Astro in Chile, showing the smaller grille of 1969-1979 U.S. models. 1980 Chevrolet Titan 90 on display in 1979 truck show at World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia. GMC Astro door emblem The GMC Astro/Chevrolet Titan are Class 8 cabover-engine (COE) trucks, sold in both single and tandem rear axle configurations. In contrast to the Crackerbox, the cab of the Astro was lengthened nearly six inches into a 54-inch BBC length with two sleeper cab configurations available. In what would be a distinguishing feature of the vehicle, the Astro/Titan was produced with a wraparound dashboard; the speedometer and tachometer were placed directly in the line of sight of the driver while most secondary gauges were placed off to the side, based on their level of use. In stark contrast to the boxy Crackerbox, the exterior of the Astro/Titan featured rounded body corners and wraparound windshield glass. In 1975, GMC introduced a Dragfoiler roof spoiler as an option. In an option that became standard a year later, in 1979, GMC and Chevrolet offered the SS (Special Series) package. Featuring a (much) larger radiator grille, improvements to exterior and interior trim, the SS package was meant to market the Astro/Titan towards owner-operators. In 1983, the Aero Astro option package was released, largely as an effort to improve fuel economy. Along with the Dragfoiler roof spoiler, the option package included body extension panels between the cab and trailer, an air dam below an extended bumper and an optimized radiator grille. In a major change from precedent, when introduced in 1969, the Astro/Titan were marketed exclusively with diesel engines. The base engine was the Detroit Diesel 6-71N, with the Detroit Diesel 8V71 and Cummins N-Series diesels as options. In 1972, the Detroit Diesel 12V71 became available as an option; though rarely ordered, the V12 engine would remain through 1978. Although Detroit Diesel had developed a gas-turbine version of the GMC Astro in the early 1970s, fuel-economy concerns would keep it out of production. In 1977, the Cummins KT450 and Caterpillar 3406 became options; the larger engines required the addition of a larger radiator. In 1979, the 6-71 was replaced by the 6V92, making all available Detroit Diesel engines V-engines; the 6V71 was discontinued after 1980.  Discontinuation  Following the launch of the cabover product line in 1969, the GMC Astro quickly exceeded the Chevrolet Titan in sales and market share. In 1981, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan. A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of support for heavy-duty trucks by Chevrolet dealers. In contrast to other GM brands, a key requirement of GMC franchisees of the time was the ability to sell and service the entire GMC product line. In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, the GMC motorhome, P-chassis, and school bus chassis. For a typical dealership, this meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars. In 1986, Volvo AB entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo taking an 85% stake. Having already acquired White Motor Company in 1980, the joint venture would do business as Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, selling trucks under the combined WhiteGMC product badge. Under the joint venture, GMC trucks were phased out in favor of White-designed Volvo GM products. The GMC Astro ceased production after the 1987 model year (coincidentally, two years after Chevrolet launched a van with the same name). Although Volvo GM would continue sales of COE trucks under the White GMC and Western Star brands (the WhiteGMC WH and Western Star Cabover; both versions of the White Road Commander II), the GMC Astro was never directly replaced by Volvo GM, Volvo, or General Motors.

Huwwarah if flanked by the ancient sites of Ramoth-Gilead (Ramtha, Jordan) in Gilead to the east and Arabella (Irbid) to the west. North, it is bordered by Sal and Bishra, and south and southeast it is bordered by Sareeh. , the village had a population of 23,929. The two major families (tribes or clans) in Huwarra are: the biggest Clan Al- Gharaibeh Family and Al-Shatnawi Family (in connecting with) the Al-Shara Family (The two Biggest tribes). Other (tribes/clans) include: Al-Shara (same) Al-Shar' or Al-Shroo', Al-Sawalha, Al-Ghuzlan, Al- Haddad, Al-Karasneh (thought to be the original settlers of the village), Al- Lawabneh and Al-Tanash. It is famous for its rich soil (rust colored mud soil) and wheat crops.  Geography  Houran Huwwarah is in North Jordan, about 5 km to the South-East of Irbid. It is part of the Mud Plains of Houran. The Houran lies west of Jabal ed Druze and stretches from the outskirts of Southern Damascus to the Zarqa River in Jordan. It is part of Bilad esh Sham.  History  The village contains numerous sites were some coins from Hellenistic or Roman periods were found. Furthermore, there is an agricultural section of east of Huwwarah called Dhahr El Muqhur (roofs of the caves) which is apparently a necropolis to a nearby settlement that may have been the village itself. This makes perfect sense in view of the fact that Huwwarah is in the heart of the area that contained the Decapolis union of ten famous trade towns, the most famous of which are Jerash and Gadara (Um Qais). It is unknown when Huwwarah was permanently settled. Some of the older stone buildings in the village suggest the mid-19th century. However, mud houses must have existed long before that, based on the number of generations the elderly reported through oral tradition. It is expected that there lived at least 12 generations so far in Huwwarah, making the estimated date of settlement between 1700 and 1750 CE. In 1596, during the Ottoman Empire, Huwwarah was noted in the census as being located in the nahiya of Bani Juhma in the liwa of Hawran, with a population of 21 households and 11 bachelors; all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 3,000 ak√ße. Half of the revenue, 1,500 ak√ße, was from the wheat.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 203 The history of Huwwarah is part of the history of Houran. See Johann Ludwig Burckhardt's Travels in Syria and the Holy Land for an account of a relatively recent history of the area (the winter of 1810).Burckhardt, 1822, pp. 50‚Äì120 Chapter 2: Journal of an Excursion into the Haouran in the Autumn and Winter of 1810 In 1838 Huwwarah was noted as a ruin.Smith, in Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 164 The Jordanian census of 1961 found 2,342 inhabitants in Huwwarah.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 14  The Jordanian dialect of Hourani or Hawarn√©  The Hawarn√© dialect is quite different from mainstream Jordanian Levantine, with several nouns changing. The biggest difference would be the pronunciation of the Q and K; Q is pronounced as a hard G, and the K is always pronounced as a √á (CH as in Charlie).

It has about 1,900 inhabitants. It lies on the Ston√°vka River, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Polish minority constitute 19.4% of the population. Etymology The name is of topographic origin, derived from the older name of a local Ston√°vka River, which itself denoted a murmuring river. History The village could have been first mentioned in 1388 as Stoena (Stozna?). As Stonawa it was then mentioned in 1432, a German name Steinau appeared in the 18th century. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Stinavia. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 26 March 1654. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2,040 in 1880 to 3,952 in 1910. In terms of the language spoken colloquially the majority were Polish-speakers (growing from 90.1% in 1880 to 99% in 1910), accompanied by Czech-speakers (at most 158 or 7.8% in 1880, then dropping to between 0.1% and 0.4%) and German-speakers (at most 43 or 2.1% in 1880). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (77.7%), followed by Protestants (21.1%), 3 Jews and 42 others. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect, additionally industrial growth lured a large influx of migrant workers, mostly from western Galicia. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

Biography Curr was born in Hobart, Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land), the eldest of eleven surviving children of Edward Curr (1798‚Äì1850) and Elizabeth (n√©e Micklethwaite) Curr. His parents had moved to Hobart from Sheffield, England in February 1820, where Curr's father went into business as a merchant. Curr's father left Tasmania for England in June 1823, and on his return voyage wrote An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land principally designed for the use of Emigrants, which was published in 1824, he later returned and became the chief agent of the Van Diemen's Land Company, and in November 1827, the family moved to the Circular Head region, where the company held substantial lands. Curr was sent to England for his schooling, and was educated at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, from 17 December 1829 to 10 August 1837, and the following year boarded at Douai School in northern France to study French. Curr returned to Tasmania in January 1839. Curr accompanied his father on an 1839 visit to Melbourne in the Port Phillip District (what is now the state of Victoria, which separated from New South Wales in 1851, after a campaign in which Curr's father was an important participant). From February 1841 Curr returned to the District to manage a handful of his father's sheep farming properties in northern and central Victoria, including several in the Goulburn Valley region. Curr also managed one property in a partnership with his brother William. Curr managed the properties until the end of 1850 and early 1851, when following his father's death the properties were sold. In February 1851 Curr and two of his younger brothers sailed to England, with Curr then embarking on travel around parts of Europe and the Middle East, before marrying Margaret Vaughan of County Kildare, Ireland, on 31 January 1854. Curr returned to Victoria in August 1854, staying in Melbourne for just a month before moving to Auckland, New Zealand, where he ran a business importing Australian horses. From 1856 to 1861, Curr made two unsuccessful attempts to return to work as a pastoralist, firstly in Queensland and then around the Lachlan River in central New South Wales. In November 1862 Curr traveled once more to Victoria, moving to a house in Chapel Street, St Kilda. In Victoria he worked as a government inspector of sheep, ultimately becoming Chief Inspector of Sheep on 17 May 1864. 1863 he published a book on Pure Saddle-Horses, and in 1865 won a prize Of ¬£150 for An Essay on Scab in Sheep. This was published in the same year, and the measures advocated by Curr were used with such success that the disease became rare. Curr was promoted to chief inspector of all stock on 16 January 1871, and in this role helped to stop outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in 1872 and of scab disease in sheep in 1876. Curr died in 1889 in St. Kilda, and was buried in the St Kilda General Cemetery. Publications and recognition Curr published many reports and several books throughout his career, including Pure Saddle Horses in 1863, an account of his travels through Europe and the Middle East in the early 1850s, and The Australian Race: Its Origins, Languages, Customs in 1886, an extensive work on the Aboriginal people, their habits and their dialects, compiled from numerous reports he had elicited from settlers, missionaries and others who had direct knowledge of Indigenous peoples of Australia, and who responded to his questionnaires. Curr also compiled the Australian Comparative Vocabulary, drawing on information from a network of farmers and rural workers who provided him with Aboriginal words matching those on a list he circulated. The Government of Victoria, recognising its great value, undertook the publication of the Vocabulary at the expense of the State. However, his most widely known work is Recollections of Squatting in Victoria, first published in 1883 but republished as an abridged version in 1965. This work recounts Curr's experiences managing his father's properties in northern Victoria forty years earlier, including his interactions with the local Aboriginal Australians.

The school had a comprehensive program with a specialized military academy magnet program. The academy, part of Prince George's County Public Schools, was notable as the only military academy in Prince George's County. Forestville High School was part of the United States Government's JROTC program. In addition to this, Forestville High School has been recognized in the 2006‚Äì2007 school year for making the Annual Yearly Progress (AYP). Also, around 50% of students attending FMA have passed the HSA exams. The principal of the school was Nathaniel Laney, a Prince George's County native. The JROTC program was first implemented for all grade levels in 2006, which was led by Major General Warren L. Freeman, the school's commandant. The school mandated JROTC as a class for all grade levels, based on Leadership Education Training (LET). All students began with a rank of cadet, ending with colonel. However, very few students progressed to the highest rank. In order to be promoted, one must merit it through a minimum of GPAs (depending on rank sought). Also, for the rank of Sergeant First Class and above promotions, students had to present themselves on the Promotion Board (based on peers). History Prior to 1982, the physical buildings that became Forestville High School housed Forestville Elementary and Spaulding Junior High School from 1965 - 1982, respectively. Among the faculty of Forestville Elementary was long-time principal, Mrs. Barbara Johnson and teacher Mrs. Dorothy Murray. In the Fall of 2002, the first military academy class was admitted to Forestville. Along with this came an increase in numbers of those who were members of the JROTC program. Forestville High School then moved from a Battalion JROTC level to a Brigade JROTC level, one of the largest in the state of Maryland. The first Brigade Commander was Cadet Colonel Rashonda Tangle and the highest ranking Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer was Cadet Command Sergeant Major Kiana Carr. In the fall of 2006 came more evolution. Forestville High School became Forestville Military Academy, with all students in grades 9 - 12 being enrolled in ARJROTC. In addition, with one of the largest populations of students enrolled in JROTC at a public secondary institution, Forestville became a Regiment of cadets. Cadet Colonel Jeshawna Wholley became the first Regiment Commander and Cadet Command Sergeant Major Valicia Demery became first regiment CSM of Forestville Military Academy. While members on the Board of Education of Prince George County are opposed to Forestville keeping its Military Academy status, the Academy still remains an Army Unit With Distinction. Former Cadets Colonel K. Holmes (Former Regiment Commander), Lt.Colonel A. Michel (Former Deputy Regiment Commander), Lt.Colonel E. Hunter(Former Regiment Executive Officer), and CSM. E.Boyd (Former Regiment CSM) led the charge of keeping Forestville a complete Military Academy. Although many people try to tear down the values and status of the school, FMA still keeps its national status of excellence. It welcomes new cadets every year and its main mission is to promote higher education and motivate young people into becoming better citizens. On March 8, 2016 CEO Dr. Kevin Maxwell sent a letter to parents that Forestville would be closed after the end of the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, despite protests against closing the school. PG County officials stated that the continued operations of the school could interfere with funding of nearby Suitland High School. At the time Forestville had fewer than 800 students. According to Maxwell, the primary rationale for closure was the decrease in the school's number of students. Students in the attendance zone of neighboring Suitland High were reassigned there for the 2016‚Äì2017 school year while others were reassigned to their neighborhood schools.\\"Welcome to the Forestville High School Transition Page.\\" Prince George's County Public Schools.

Because of the timing of the school's establishment, it has been categorized as a segregation academy, a term associated with private schools established in response to the court ordered racial integration of public schools. Although categorized as a segregation academy, the \\"founders of the school repeatedly stated that admission was open to all regardless of race.\\" Additionally, black students were enrolled in the school as early as 1974. The organization bought of adjacent land, for $500,000 in August 2003, to allow further expansion. Notable visitors to the school include Pat Buchanan, who spoke to the high school students in 1999.

The siege took place in Carlisle, Cumbria from October 1644 to 25 June 1645. Background For 500 years Carlisle Castle served as the principal fortress of England's north-western border with Scotland. In 1642 at the start of the First English Civil War, the castle was held and garrisoned by Royalist forces. Because of its location far to the north of England, the castle remained under the control of the Royalists for the first two years of the civil war. On 2 July 1644, the combined forces of the Covenanters and the Parliamentarians decisively defeated the Royalists at the Battle of Marston Moor near York. The Royalists lost 5,500 men along with all their ordinance, gunpowder, and supplies. Two weeks later the besieged city of York surrendered. The commander of the Royalist northern army, the Marquis of Newcastle, and other senior officers fled the country in embarrassment. As a result, the Royalist no longer had an army in the north. After the Parliamentarian victory at Marston Moor, Alexander Leslie who commanded the Covenanters began a campaign in the north to capture Royalist garrisons and urban centers. By 15 August, Leslie's Covenanter army had reached the important port city of Newcastle and resumed a siege that had ended unsuccessfully the previously February. The siege After the surrender of Newcastle on 27 October 1644, Leslie took 4,000 of his Covenanters, composed of both infantry and cavalry, to Carlisle and began the siege of the walled city and fortress. He quartered his force in the villages surrounding Carlisle and erected siege works on the four major roads leading to the city. The siege works blocking the road from the north was placed in the churchyard at the village of Stanwix and included three small cannons. All the other siege works seemed to simply be fortifications designed to hold 60 to 100 cavalry riders. Together the four siege works blocked access to the city and castle from all four directions of the compass. This initial encirclement of Carlisle was not particularly confining to the Royalists as it left a substantial amount of grazing ground for cattle and horses outside the walls of the city. Leslie, however, didn't seem to be in a hurry to take the garrison. For approximately six months, Leslie seemed content to sit and wait. All that while, the Covenanters never attacked the city. During that time the primary action between the two opposing forces were skirmishes that took place when the Royalist would sally outside the city walls to procure cattle and provisions. In the spring, the Covenanter forces were joined by Parliamentarian forces. About that time, at the end of April, Leslie began to move his siege works closer to the city and to erect additional fortifications. The contraction of the siege perimeter slowly reduced the number of successful sallies the Royalists were able to conduct diminishing their food supplies. Starvation set in on the garrison causing the besieged Royalist to eat whatever they could including horses, dogs and rats. Finally in the summer of 1645, King Charles and his Royalist army lost another major battle at Naseby. Out of provisions with a diminished hope of relief, the Royalist garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered on 25 June 1645. Aftermath The terms of the \\"Articles of Agreement for the Surrender of Carlisle Castle\\" included the following provisions: * The castle, city, and Citadel of Carlisle along with all forts, towers, canons, ammunition, and furniture shall be surrendered to Lieutenant General Leslie. * Sir Thomas Glennam, Sir Henry Stradling, their officers and men shall be allowed to march out of Carlisle as free men with their colours flying and drums beating. They shall be allowed to leave Carlisle with their firearms, bags, baggage, and twelve charges of powder each. They shall be allowed to march from Carlisle to join their King without the fear of being attacked. * The people of Carlisle shall not be harmed, nor shall their homes be looted or destroyed.

Wolf (Benjamin) ben Samson Heidenheim (1757 ‚Äì February 23, 1832) was a German exegete and grammarian. Biography Born at Heidenheim am Hahnenkamm, at an early age Heidenheim was sent to F√ºrth, where he studied Talmud under Joseph Steinhardt (author of Zikron Yosef) and, from 1777, under Hirsch Janow. Besides Talmudic literature, Heidenheim devoted himself to the study of Hebrew grammar, and particularly of the Masorah. In 1782 he left F√ºrth, probably on account of Janow's opposition to Mendelssohn's translation of the Pentateuch, of which Heidenheim was an admirer. He went to Frankfurt am Main, where he made the acquaintance of the most prominent scholars, among them and Solomon Dubno. There began his literary activity, which lasted fifty years. He died at R√∂delheim.  Works  Heidenheim, encouraged by Dubno, conceived the idea of issuing a revised edition of the Pentateuch, with a commentary of his own. The first work edited by him was Abraham ibn Ezra's Moznayim, to which he added a critical commentary (Offenbach, 1791). Seven years later Heidenheim began his critical edition of the Pentateuch, which he titled Sefer Torat Elohim. It contained the Targum, the commentaries of Rashi and Rashbam, the 'Min·∏•at Shai of Solomon Norzi, his own glosses and Masoretic references, and his supercommentary on Rashi, Havanat ha-Mi·∏≥ra. He based his commentary chiefly on the accents, adding numerous grammatical notes. But the undertaking, on the business side, was too difficult for him alone, and he was compelled to stop at Genesis 43:16.  His Mahzor  He next entered into partnership with Baruch Baschwitz, an energetic business man; through the assistance of Breidenbach they obtained from the Count of Solms-R√∂delheim, under favorable conditions, a license to establish a printing-press at R√∂delheim, where they relocated in 1799. Heidenheim immediately began an edition of the Ma·∏•zor, with a Hebrew commentary by himself and a German translation by himself and Breidenbach (1800). In order to give a correct text, Heidenheim had secured the most ancient manuscripts, among them being one of the year 1258, as well as the earliest Italian and German editions. At the end of the Ma·∏•zor to Shemini A·∫ìeret there is printed Heidenheim's Ha-Piyyu·π≠im veha-Paye·π≠anim, an essay on the liturgists. In 1806, Baschwitz having withdrawn, Heidenheim became sole proprietor. In that year he published his Mevo haLashon, a treatise on Hebrew grammar, and in 1808 his Sefer Mishpete ha-Ta'amim, a treatise on the accents according to the ancient grammarians. His Pentateuch editions Ten years later Heidenheim recommenced his edition of the Pentateuch, but with a larger scope. It was published in four separate editions between 1818 and 1821: * One edition, Me'or 'Enayim, contains the text, the commentary En ha-·∏≤ore, and the author's treatise (En ha-Sofer) on the square characters * Another edition, Moda' la-Binah, contains the text, the commentary of Rashi, and the author's supercommentary; * The third edition, Ti·∏≥·∏≥un Sofer, is an unvocalized text for scribes; * The fourth contains the text, with a German translation, and a commentary titled Min·∏•ah ·∏§adashah.  Other publications  Heidenheim also published: * The Pesa·∏• Haggadah (German transl.; 1822) * The Pir·∏≥e Abot (German transl.; 1823) * Siddur Safah Berurah, the daily prayers with a German translation (before 1800) * Ma'aseh Ta'tu'im, a polemic against the Kabbalist Nathan Adler (anonymous, but ascribed to Heidenheim) * Seder Tish'ah be-Ab (German transl., with notes; 1826) * Seli·∏•ot (German transl., with a Hebrew commentary; 1834) * Festt√§gliches Gebetbuch, hebr√§isch und deutsch.

The song became \\"an instant best-seller\\" Note: Veteran collectors of blues and jazz 78s of the 1920s and 1930s have pointed out that official sales figures do not exist for this particular record, and that sales of \\"over a million\\" (as previously reported here) is extremely unlikely. A more realistic figure is thought to be at least 100,000 copies, ranging upwards, perhaps, as much as 200,000 ‚Äì although again, we must stress this is purely conjecture, based on the evidence of the surviving copies. and one of the first blues standards, inspiring many blues songs of the era. It has been recorded by many artists, not only in blues but also country and western, pop, and jazz. Original song \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\" is based on \\"How Long Daddy\\", recorded in 1925 by Ida Cox with Papa Charlie Jackson. Leroy Carr (vocal and piano) and Scrapper Blackwell (guitar) recorded the song in Indianapolis, Indiana, on June 19, 1928, for Vocalion Records, shortly after they began performing together. It is a moderately slow-tempo blues with an eight-bar structure, notated in or common time in the key of C. The original recording is in E. Carr is credited with the lyrics and music for the song, which uses a departed train as a metaphor for a lover who has left: Carr's and Blackwell's songs reflected a more urban and sophisticated blues, in contrast to the music of rural bluesmen of the time. Carr's blues were \\"expressive and evocative\\", although his vocals have also been described as emotionally detached, high-pitched and smooth, with clear diction. Blackwell's single-string jazz guitar lines provided the role of a responsorial voice as well as rhythmic chording. \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\" was Carr and Scrapwell's biggest hit.Herzhaft 1992, p. 453. They subsequently recorded six more versions of the song (two of them, unissued at the time), as \\"How Long, How Long Blues, Part 2\\", \\"Part 3\\", \\"How Long Has That Evening Train Been Gone\\", \\"The New How Long, How Long Blues\\", etc. There are considerable variations in the lyrics, many of which have since fallen out of use in modern performances. Most versions begin with the lyric \\"How long, how long, has that evening train been gone?\\" Legacy \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\" became an early blues standard and \\"its lilting melody inspired hundreds of later compositions\\",Wald 2004, p. 37. including the Mississippi Sheiks' \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" and Robert Johnson's \\"Come On in My Kitchen\\". Although his later style would not suggest it, Muddy Waters recalled that it was the first song he learned to play \\"off the Leroy Carr record\\".Wald 2004, p. 58. In 1988, Carr's \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in the category \\"Classics of Blues Recordings ‚Äì Singles or Album Tracks\\". In 2012, the song received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, which \\"honor[s] recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance\\". Carr's partnership with guitarist Blackwell combined his light bluesy piano with a melodic jazzy guitar that was a progenitor of urban blues. His vocal style moved blues singing toward an urban sophistication and influenced such singers as T-Bone Walker, Charles Brown, Amos Milburn, Jimmy Witherspoon, Ray Charles, amongst others. Blackwell's jazz single-string guitar lines helped pave the way for electric guitarists such as Eddie Durham and Charlie Christian. Later renditions It has been noted that \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\" \\"enjoyed such immense popularity that it as seized upon by numerous blues singers and jazz artists, its impact spreading way beyond the boundaries of the purely black community\\". Some of these artists include Pigmeat Markham, who recorded the song for Blue Note Records in 1945 with Oliver \\"Rev\\" Mesheux's sextet; James Crutchfield, who recorded the song in 1955 (released on the 2000 CD Biddle Street Barrelhousin'); Lonnie Donegan (1956, Lonnie Donegan Showcase); Big Joe Turner (1956, The Boss of the Blues); Johnnie Ray (1956, The Big Beat); Lou Rawls (1962, Black and Blue); Dinah Washington (1963, Back to the Blues); Davy Graham (1963, The Guitar Player); Hot Tuna (1970, Hot Tuna); Grateful Dead, who performed it live once (February 12, 1989, at the Great Western Forum, with Spencer Davis as a guest);Several times during the Grateful Dead's 1970 acoustic sit-down sets, they covered the 1929 song \\"How Long\\" by Frank Stokes (not to be confused with Carr's \\"How Long, How Long Blues\\"). Eric Clapton (1994, From the Cradle); and Pinetop Perkins (1997, Born in the Delta). In 1963, Ella Fitzgerald included this on her Verve release These are the Blues.

The four members of the group were Karin Vlasblom (born August 10, 1967), Laura Vlasblom (born October 8, 1968), Mandy Huydts (born April 9, 1969) and Marjon Keller (born June 1, 1970). History Early years: Kinderen voor Kinderen The girls debuted in 1981 on the second album of Kinderen voor Kinderen, a children's choir whose ongoing television-shows are broadcast by VARA each November. All four of them were given a lead vocal; Karin in Gastarbeider (a song about a forbidden love between a Dutch girl and a Greek boy), Mandy in Bijna brugklas (about the transition from primary to secondary school) and Marjon in Roken, an anti-smoking tirade. Laura sang Verlegenheid (a reminder that shyness hits everyone at one moment) in an embryonic line-up of Frizzle Sizzle (minus Marjon). Due to their age (14 was the maximum), the Vlasblom sisters left after the second album; Mandy and Marjon paid further contributions to the third album. The former sang Ik ben verliefd (about being in love), the latter Op de wip (about being stuck in the middle between a pain-in-the-neck brother and a bossy sister). Marjon left after the fourth album on which she had minor roles in two tracks; Iedereen gaat voor z'n beurt (Nobody waits his turn) and 'Ziek zijn (which sums up the joys of pretending to be sick to miss a day of school). She also sang the first half of the call-for-exercise Trim trim trim. Breaking out and breaking through In 1984 the girls appeared on the fifth show to tell that they formed a girl group and sang about their days with the choir as a bridge between the interviews with the departures and the new batch of songs. Marjon contributed to the volumes 5 and 6 as a backing vocalist. Naming themselves Frizzle Sizzle they were selected to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 with Alles heeft een ritme (Everything has rhythm), a continuation of the original Kinderen voor Kinderen-sound. At the end of the night, they ranked 13th out of 20, receiving 40 points. In the Dutch charts, the song went to No. 21. Soon afterwards Frizzle Sizzle released songs in English (Never Give Up being the first). In early 1987 they had a No. 14 hit with Talk it Over, which was favourably compared to the established girl group Dolly Dots. Second Chance reached No. 38 the same year. Frizzle Sizzle were joint winners of the 1987 Silver Harp Awards for new bands with their first and only album First Date. In 1988 Frizzle Sizzle appeared on the educational TV-show Mijn Eerste Keer (My First Time) singing about their first bicycle-ride (backed by an on-location video). Solo activities In 1990 they broke up but not before lending their voices to the Herman van Veen-created cartoon series Alfred J Kwak and releasing the World Cup-themed Alles Is Oranje (Everything Is Orange). The girls remained active in showbusiness. *Karin made television programmes. Laura Vlasblom performing in 1999. *Laura pursued a solo career and lived with boyband singer-turned-musical actor Bastiaan Ragas. (She also does Dutch voice-overs & songs for many characters in animated movies. For example, she voiced Gloria in Madagascar, Prinses Jasmine in Aladdin, Thumbelina in Thumbelina (1994), Robyn Starling in Tom and Jerry: The Movie & Ariel in The Little Mermaid). In 1992 Laura participated in the Dutch heat of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Gouden Bergen (Gold Mountains); she had to settle for silver as it reached the second spot. In 1999 Laura appeared on RTL's live-music programme De Vrienden van Amstel; she performed three songs (two covers, one original) backed by Dutch-Moluccan percussion-rockers Massada. *Mandy Huydts became a backing vocalist for megastar Rene Froger although she continued to perform her own songs. *Marjon Keller, now hosting radio-shows as well as doing voice-overs for RTL, always insisted on not being lived by stardom. Back in 1988 she was quoted \\"It (was) fun being part of Frizzle Sizzle, but there are more things in life\\". In 1995 former members of Kinderen voor Kinderen were invited to attend the 15th show (hosted by Paul de Leeuw). The ex-Frizzle Sizzles were unavailable, but they later made an in- crowd appearance at De Leeuw's own TV-show; still barefoot, as in their heydays.

It has a population of around 5,400. It lies five kilometers north of the city centre of Karvin√°, on the border with Poland, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The Petr≈Øvka River flows through the municipality and enters the Olza River in Z√°vada. Administrative parts Formerly independent villages of Doln√≠ Marklovice, Prstn√° and Z√°vada are since 1952 administrative parts of Petrovice u Karvin√©. Etymology The name is patronymic in origin, derived from the personal name Petr/Piotr (locally Pieter), ending alternately with typically Slavic -(ow/ov)ice or with German -dorf meaning village. History The village was first mentioned in a written document as a seat of a Catholic parish in an incomplete register of Peter's Pence payment from 1335 as villa Petri and as such the parish was one of the oldest in the region. It was again mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Petirsdorff. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 14 April 1654. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,022 in 1880 to 1,444 in 1910. In terms of the language spoken colloquially the majority were Polish-speakers (at least 82.8% in 1880, at most 91.3% in 1900), accompanied by German- speakers (at least 6.7% in 1900, at most 15% in 1880) and Czech-speakers (at most 2.6% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (1,410 or 97.6%), followed by Protestants (20 or 1.4%) and Jews (14 or 1%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria- Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was invaded by Polish army and annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. Demography As of 2020, it had a population of around 5,384, which makes it the most populated municipality in the Czech Republic without the town status. 13% of the population are the ethnic Poles, 1,2% are Slovaks and also 1,2% Silesians. Around 22,7% of the population is religious (mostly Roman-Catholic), which is about the double of the national average.

Up until 1563 it was under the direct supervision of the Roman pontiff. In that year, the diocese of Urbino was elevated to metropolitan status, and Cagli became a suffragan see of Urbino.Ughelli, p. 810. The diocese was abolished as an independent entity in 1986, when it was incorporated into the diocese of Fano- Fossombrone-Cagli-Pergola. It was still a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino. The historical diocese of Cagli was renamed in 1819. Pergola, which had been in the diocese of Urbino, was raised to the rank of an episcopal city and united to the See of Cagli. History Bishop Egidio (1243‚Äì59) had many controversies with the municipality of Gubbio. Under his successor the Ghibellines revolted against the papal power. After the death of Bishop Jacopo (1276), the Ghibelline canons wished to elect a noble, Berardo Berardi, while the Guelphs elected Rinaldo Sicardi, Abbot of San Pietro di Massa. As a result the see remained vacant for some years. Finally Berardo was made bishop of Osimo, and Sicardi died, whereupon a certain Guglielmo was elected bishop (1285). Civil discords, however, did not cease, and after a terrible massacre, Cagli was burned by its own citizens. It was afterwards rebuilt on the plain of St. Angelo, and Pope Nicholas IV named it St. Angelo of the Pope (S. Angelo papale). Later on, however, the original name of Cagli was substituted. In 1297 the first stone of the cathedral was laid by the Bishop Lituardo Cervati, and in 1398 Niccol√≤ Marciari brought the building to completion. In 1503 the partisans of Cesare Borgia killed the Franciscan bishop Gasparo Golfi. His successor, a Spanish Dominican, Ludovico di Lagoria, was nearly killed by the people. End of the diocese In a decree of the Second Vatican Council, it was recommended that dioceses be reorganized to take into account modern developments.Directoriae normae clare a Concilio impertitae de dioecesium recognitione; indicia atque elementa apta ad actionem pastoralem aestimandam ab episcopis suppeditata quibus plurium dioecesium regimen commissum est. A project begun on orders from Pope John XXIII, and continued under his successors, was intended to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy. The change was made urgent because of changes made to the Concordat between the Italian State and the Holy See on 18 February 1984, and embodied in a law of 3 June 1985. The reorganization was approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Papal Curia on 30 September 1986. The diocese of Fano was united to the dioceses of Cagli e Pergola and of Fossombrone. Its name was to be Fanensis-Forosemproniensis-Calliensis-Pergulanus. The seat of the diocese was to be in Fano. The former cathedral in Cagli and the former cathedral in Fossombrone were to have the honorary title of co-cathedral, and their chapters were to be called the \\"Capitulum Concathedralis\\". There was to be only one episcopal curia, one seminary, one ecclesiastical tribunal; and all the clergy were to be incardinated in the diocese of Fano-Fossombrone- Caglia-Pergola.Acta Apostolicae Sedis An. et Vol. LXXIX (Citt√† del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 701-704.

Biography  Boris de Zirkoff was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia on March 7, 1902. His father was Mihail Vassilyevich de Zirkoff, a Russian general. His mother was Lydia Dmitriyevna von Hahn, who was a second cousin to Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. The Russian Revolution forced his family to flee in 1917 to Stockholm across Finland. Boris studied in some European universities, where he specialized in languages and classics. \\"At Baden-Baden in Germany, he met a Russian American, Nikolai Romanoff, and learned from him about the existence, at Point Loma, close San Diego in California, of the organization, named Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society. He wrote a letter to Mrs. Katherine Tingley, then head of the Society, and when she visited Europe, they met in Finland. Mrs. Tingley, who had learned that Boris was Blavatsky's relative, invited him to come to the headquarters at Point Loma and promised him all the necessary help in regard to his travel to America.\\" He performed this journey towards the end of 1923.  Blavatsky's Collected Writings  In 1924, while residing at the Headquarters of the Point Loma Theosophical Society, Boris resolved to compile Blavatsky's writings. This plan led to a worldwide correspondence and over 50 years of research. The first four volumes were published between 1933 and 1936 by \\"Rider & Co.\\" as The Complete Works of H. P. Blavatsky, however, this edition forms were destroyed during World War II. These volumes were recovered only in 1966‚Äì69. Between 1950 and 1981, Boris managed to publish the first 12 volumes of Blavatsky's Collected Writings. \\"From his manuscripts for Volumes XIII and XIV the remaining numbered series were completed in 1982 and 1985. And a Cumulative Index Volume XV was then published in 1991.\\" From 1944 to 1981, De Zirkoff edited in Los Angeles a magazine Theosophia. According to WorldCat, Boris had written 49 works.

He is a dual-code rugby international centre who represented the British and Irish Lions at rugby union, and Great Britain at rugby league. Life and career Born in Caerau near Maesteg in the north of the Llynfi Valley, Bateman was a precocious rugby talent playing for his Primary and Junior school team, Plasnewydd (coached by David Rogers), and the Maesteg Town team in the 1970s. He excelled at both rugby and soccer, being a very fast sprinter, and also possessing a very large lung capacity which allowed him to recover from physical exertion rapidly. He was an outstanding player for Maesteg Comprehensive School where he was coached by Peter Williams, brother of Wales and British Lions superstar J.J. Williams (also from the Llynfi Valley), and by Wales back row international Gareth Williams. He began his senior rugby career for Maesteg RFC \\"The Old Parish\\" at their Llynfi Road ground. As a centre for Neath, Bateman gained four caps for Wales in 1990 before moving to rugby league with Warrington Wolves, Bateman played right-, i.e. number 3, in Warrington's 12-2 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1990‚Äì91 League Cup (rugby league) Final during the 1990‚Äì91 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 12 January 1991, and played right-, i.e. number 3, in the 10-40 defeat by Wigan in the 1994‚Äì95 League Cup (rugby league) Final during the 1994‚Äì95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 28 January 1995. He returned to rugby union after it went professional in 1996 to gain a further 31 Wales caps and one for the British and Irish Lions in 1997. In rugby league he played for Wales 13 times and Great Britain twice. He also had a successful spell in Australian rugby league with the Cronulla Sharks. During his short stint at Northampton Saints he was a key figure in their Heineken Cup triumph in 2000. He became known as \\"The Clamp\\" in his rugby league days because of the ferocity of his tackling. He follows in a tradition of rugby talents from the Llynfi Valley including Ray \\"Chico\\" Hopkins, J.J. Williams and Gwyn Evans. Career Record in Rugby Union for Wales: Played 35: Won 22, Lost 13 Test Points: 50 Tries: 10. Following his retirement from professional rugby, Bateman continued to play for his hometown club of Maesteg. Putting his education to good use, he now works in the Hematology Department of Princess of Wales Hospital but still plays at an amateur level for local club Heol-y-Cyw.

Family background His uncle was Alfred Beit, a South African mining millionaire, after whom he was named when he was born in London on 19 January 1903. His father Otto Beit (1865‚Äì1930) was awarded the in 1920 and was created a baronet in February 1924. His mother was Lilian, daughter of Thomas Lane Carter of New Orleans, US. On Sir Otto's death in 1930, Alfred inherited a large fortune as well as numerous works of art, including works by Goya, Vermeer, Rubens and Gainsborough. Having lived at 49 Belgrave Square, he bought a mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens (the most exclusive address in London), where these paintings were put on display. Beyond personal wealth, by 1930 the Beit family had philanthropically supported primarily the Imperial College of Science and Technology, the Rhodes Trust and had established the Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical Research, besides many smaller donations to other groups. Political career Known from 1930 as Sir Alfred Beit, he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for St Pancras South East at the 1931 general election and re-elected in the 1935 general election. When the Second World War started he joined the Royal Air Force serving in Bomber Command.Lady Beit -- Daily Telegraph obituary, 9 September 2005. In 1944 he was appointed PPS to Oliver Stanley, the Colonial Secretary. Beit lost his seat in the 1945 general election. Disillusioned with British politics and strongly opposed to the new Labour government, he and his wife moved to South Africa. However they were appalled by the apartheid system that developed there after 1948, and soon returned to the UK.Obituary: Clementine, Lady Beit -- The Independent obituary, 27 August 2005. Family life In 1938 he married Clementine Mabell Kitty Freeman-Mitford, born on 22 October 1915, who was the posthumous daughter of Major Clement Mitford (d.1915), a granddaughter of the 1st Lord Redesdale and a cousin of the Mitford sisters. Another first cousin Clementine Hozier had married Winston Churchill. Clementine's widowed mother spent long periods in Africa after marrying Captain Courteney Brocklehust, a game warden. Clementine and her sister were frequently sent to stay with their cousins. She was a contemporary of Unity Mitford at St Margaret's School, Bushey, and also went to Berlin to learn German, where she met Hitler through her cousin. She was occasionally escorted by a handsome young stormtrooper, and was asked by Unity to \\"waggle a flag\\" as \\"the darling F√ºhrer\\" passed in the street. Given the Beits' Jewish origins, this chance encounter with fascism did not last. Despite a happy marriage, the Beits had no children. Later life Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid by Vermeer, one of the paintings Beit donated to the National Gallery of Ireland in 1987. Alfred Beit bought Russborough House in County Wicklow, Ireland in 1952, following a suggestion by Randal, 19th Lord Dunsany, and moved his art collection there. He had copied a mantelpiece from Russborough in his London home in the 1930s, and was aware of the beauty of the house long before they moved there. The Beits continued to visit Africa in the 1950s and, having no children of their own, they paid for schools, libraries and health clinics in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Botswana. However, by the late 1970s they were saddened that many of these improvements had not been maintained by the post-colonial governments. Living quietly in Ireland, their main interests centered on supporting the fine arts and the Wexford Festival Opera. Art thefts In 1974, an IRA gang led by Rose Dugdale broke into Russborough House, making off with nineteen paintings, including a Goya, a Vermeer and a Gainsborough. The stolen paintings were notionally valued at more than IR¬£8 million.Russborough House has history of art thefts -- RT√â News, 26 June 2001. In the process, the Beits were pistol-whipped, tied up and pushed down a flight of stone stairs. The IRA intended to hold the paintings to ransom in exchange for the transfer of Dolours Price and Marian Price, IRA members who had been convicted of car- bombings in England. All the stolen paintings were recovered in County Cork a few weeks later.An Artful Dodge -- Time magazine article, 8 December 2002. In 1986, the house was robbed again, this time by the Dublin criminal Martin Cahill (known in the tabloid media as \\"The General\\"). Cahill and his gang stole 18 paintings notionally valued at IR¬£30 million, all but two of which were recovered in police operations in Britain, Belgium and Turkey. In 2001, two more paintings (a Bellotto and a Gainsborough) were stolen in another robbery. Both were recovered in 2002. In 2002, another robbery took five paintings, including two Rubens. As a result of the thefts, the Irish state had to move the unique collection to Dublin, making Russborough less attractive to tourists. Award for unique donation Beit was made an honorary Irish citizen in 1993, in recognition of his philanthropy, including a 1987 donation of seventeen masterpieces to the National Gallery of Ireland. The paintings donated had an estimated value of between IR¬£50 million and IR¬£100 million.Seanad √âireann - Volume 118 - 20 January 1988, Appropriation Act, 1987: Motion -- Senator Katharine Bulbulia addressing Seanad √âireann. The gallery described the donation as \\"among the greatest single gift to any Gallery in the world in that generation\\". The Beit Wing of the National Gallery on Merrion Square is named in honour of the Beits, who also served on the Board of Directors of the gallery.National Gallery of Ireland -- National Gallery of Ireland website, retrieved 26 November 2006. When his wife Clementine died in 2005, her will stated that Alfred Beit's diaries should be kept secret until 21 years after Queen Elizabeth II's death or 70 years after Lady Beit's own death, a clause which sparked speculation in the media that her diaries might refer to the private life of the queen. However, it is also typical of such a family to refer in their wills and trusts to a future unknown date that would become well-known, for example the date of death of a public personage. She and Sir Alfred are both buried in Blessington, County Wicklow. Alfred Beit Foundation The Beits' cultural work is carried on by the Alfred Beit Foundation, founded in 1976 and based at Russborough.Russborough House, Blessington In December 2006 the Foundation sold a collection of Italian medieval bronzes for ¬£2,000,000 at Christie's in London to support ongoing repairs at Russborough.The Beit Collection of early Italian Bronzes (catalogue ref 7288A) October 2006.

The theory posits that a small minority, consisting of members of the economic elite and policy-planning networks, holds the most power‚Äîand that this power is independent of democratic elections.\\"Theories of American Democracy\\" Through positions in corporations or on corporate boards, and influence over policy-planning networks through financial support of foundations or positions with think tanks or policy-discussion groups, members of the \\"elite\\" exert significant power over corporate and government decisions. The basic characteristics of this theory are that power is concentrated, the elites are unified, the non-elites are diverse and powerless, elites' interests are unified due to common backgrounds and positions and the defining characteristic of power is institutional position. Elite theory opposes pluralism (more than one system of power), a tradition that emphasized how multiple major social groups and interests have influence upon and various forms of representation within more powerful sets of rulers, contributing to decently representative political outcomes that reflect the collective needs of a society. Elite theory argues either that democracy is a utopian folly, as it is traditionally viewed in the conservative Italian tradition, or that democracy in its idealized form is not realizable within capitalism (a common view of Marxist-inspired elite theorists). Even when entire groups are ostensibly completely excluded from the state's traditional networks of power (historically, on the basis of arbitrary criteria such as nobility, race, gender, or religion), elite theory recognizes that \\"counter-elites\\" frequently develop within such excluded groups. Negotiations between such disenfranchised groups and the state can be analyzed as negotiations between elites and counter-elites. A major problem, in turn, is the ability of elites to co-opt counter-elites. History Italian school of elitism Vilfredo Pareto (1848‚Äì1923), Gaetano Mosca (1858‚Äì1941), and Robert Michels (1876‚Äì1936), were cofounders of the Italian school of elitism, which influenced subsequent elite theory in the Western tradition.Robert A. Nye, The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels, Sage, 1977.J. J. Chambliss (ed.), Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2013, p. 179. The outlook of the Italian school of elitism is based on two ideas: # Power lies in position of authority in key economic and political institutions. # The psychological difference that sets elites apart is that they have personal resources, for instance intelligence and skills, and a vested interest in the government; while the rest are incompetent and do not have the capabilities of governing themselves, the elite are resourceful and strive to make the government work. For in reality, the elite would have the most to lose in a failed state. Vilfredo Pareto Pareto emphasized the psychological and intellectual superiority of elites, believing that they were the highest accomplishers in any field. He discussed the existence of two types of elites: # Governing elites # Non-governing elites He also extended the idea that a whole elite can be replaced by a new one and how one can circulate from being elite to non-elite. Gaetano Mosca Mosca emphasized the sociological and personal characteristics of elites. He said elites are an organized minority and that the masses are an unorganized majority. The ruling class is composed of the ruling elite and the sub-elites. He divides the world into two group: # Political class # Non-Political class Mosca asserts that elites have intellectual, moral, and material superiority that is highly esteemed and influential. Robert Michels Sociologist Michels developed the iron law of oligarchy where, he asserts, social and political organizations are run by few individuals, and social organization and labor division are key. He believed that all organizations were elitist and that elites have three basic principles that help in the bureaucratic structure of political organization: # Need for leaders, specialized staff and facilities # Utilization of facilities by leaders within their organization # The importance of the psychological attributes of the leaders Contemporary elite theorists Elmer Eric Schattschneider Elmer Eric Schattschneider offered a strong critique of the American political theory of pluralism: Rather than an essentially democratic system in which the many competing interests of citizens are amply represented, if not advanced, by equally many competing interest groups, Schattschneider argued the pressure system is biased in favor of \\"the most educated and highest-income members of society\\", and showed that \\"the difference between those who participate in interest group activity and those who stand at the sidelines is much greater than between voters and nonvoters\\".Woolley and Papa 1998, 165 In The Semisovereign People, Schattschneider argued the scope of the pressure system is really quite small: The \\"range of organized, identifiable, known groups is amazingly narrow; there is nothing remotely universal about it\\" and the \\"business or upper-class bias of the pressure system shows up everywhere\\". He says the \\"notion that the pressure system is automatically representative of the whole community is a myth\\" and, instead, the \\"system is skewed, loaded and unbalanced in favor of a fraction of a minority\\".Schattschneider 1960, 30-36 C. Wright Mills Mills published his book The Power Elite in 1956, in which he claimed to present a new sociological perspective on systems of power in the United States. He identified a triumvirate of power groups‚Äîpolitical, economic and military‚Äîwhich form a distinguishable, although not unified, power-wielding body in the United States. Mills proposed that this group had been generated through a process of rationalization at work in all advanced industrial societies whereby the mechanisms of power became concentrated, funneling overall control into the hands of a limited, somewhat corrupt group. This reflected a decline in politics as an arena for debate and relegation to a merely formal level of discourse. This macro-scale analysis sought to point out the degradation of democracy in \\"advanced\\" societies and the fact that power generally lies outside the boundaries of elected representatives. A main influence for the study was Franz Leopold Neumann's book, Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933‚Äì1944, a study of how Nazism came to power in the German democratic state. It provided the tools to analyze the structure of a political system and served as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalistic democracy. Floyd Hunter The elite theory analysis of power was also applied on the micro scale in community power studies such as that by Floyd Hunter (1953). Hunter examined in detail the power of relationships evident in his \\"Regional City\\" looking for the \\"real\\" holders of power rather than those in obvious official positions. He posited a structural-functional approach that mapped hierarchies and webs of interconnection within the city‚Äîmapping relationships of power between businessmen, politicians, clergy etc. The study was promoted to debunk current concepts of any \\"democracy\\" present within urban politics and reaffirm the arguments for a true representative democracy. This type of analysis was also used in later, larger scale, studies such as that carried out by M. Schwartz examining the power structures within the sphere of the corporate elite in the United States. G. William Domhoff In his controversial book Who Rules America?, G. William Domhoff researched local and national decision making process networks seeking to illustrate the power structure in the United States. He asserts, much like Hunter, that an elite class that owns and manages large income-producing properties (like banks and corporations) dominate the American power structure politically and economically. James Burnham Burnham‚Äôs early work The Managerial Revolution sought to express the movement of all functional power into the hands of managers rather than politicians or businessmen‚Äîseparating ownership and control. Many of these ideas were adapted by paleoconservatives Samuel T. Francis and Paul Gottfried in their theories of the managerial state. Burnham described his thoughts on elite theory more specifically in his book, The Machiavellians, which discusses, among others, Pareto, Mosca, and Michels. Burnham attempts a scientific analysis of both elites and politics generally. Robert D. Putnam Putnam saw the development of technical and exclusive knowledge among administrators and other specialist groups as a mechanism that strips power from the democratic process and slips it to the advisors and specialists who influence the decision process. > \\"If the dominant figures of the past hundred years have been the > entrepreneur, the businessman, and the industrial executive, the ‚Äònew men‚Äô > are the scientists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers of > the new intellectual technology.\\" Thomas R. Dye Dye in his book Top Down Policymaking, argues that U.S. public policy does not result from the \\"demands of the people\\", but rather from elite consensus found in Washington, D.C.-based non-profit foundations, think tanks, special-interest groups, and prominent lobbying and law firms. Dye's thesis is further expanded upon in his works: The Irony of Democracy, Politics in America, Understanding Public Policy, and Who's Running America?. George A. Gonzalez In his book Corporate Power and the Environment, George A. Gonzalez writes on the power of U.S. economic elites to shape environmental policy for their own advantage. In The Politics of Air Pollution: Urban Growth, Ecological Modernization and Symbolic Inclusion and also in Urban Sprawl, Global Warming, and the Empire of Capital Gonzalez employs elite theory to explain the interrelationship between environmental policy and urban sprawl in America. His most recent work, Energy and Empire: The Politics of Nuclear and Solar Power in the United States demonstrates that economic elites tied their advocacy of the nuclear energy option to post-1945 American foreign policy goals, while at the same time these elites opposed government support for other forms of energy, such as solar, that cannot be dominated by one nation. Ralf Dahrendorf In his book Reflections on the Revolution in Europe,Dahrendorf, Ralf (1990) Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: In a letter intended to have been sent to a gentleman in Warsaw. New York: Random House Ralf Dahrendorf asserts that, due to advanced level of competence required for political activity, a political party tends to become, actually, a provider of \\"political services\\", that is, the administration of local and governmental public offices. During the electoral campaign, each party tries to convince voters it is the most suitable for managing the state business. The logical consequence would be to acknowledge this character and openly register the parties as service providing companies. In this way, the ruling class would include the members and associates of legally acknowledged companies and the \\"class that is ruled\\" would select by election the state administration company that best fits its interests. Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page In their statistical analysis of 1,779 policy issues professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page found that \\"economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.\\"Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens (Fall 2014) Thomas Ferguson The political scientist Thomas Ferguson's Investment Theory of Party Competition can be thought of as an elite theory. Set out most extensively in his 1995 book Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-driven Political Systems, the theory begins by noting that in modern political systems the cost of acquiring political awareness is so great that no citizen can afford it. As a consequence, these systems tend be dominated by those who can, most typically elites and corporations. These elites then seek to influence politics by 'investing' in the parties or policies they support through political contributions and other means such as endorsements in the media.

The archbishop's seat is in Basilica Cattedrale di S. Eusebio, a minor basilica dedicated to its canonized first bishop, in Vercelli, Piemonte (Piedmont). The city also has two Minor basilicas: Basilica di S. Andrea and Basilica di S. Maria Maggiore  Ecclesiastical province  The suffragan dioceses under the Metropolitan of Vercelli are: * Roman Catholic Diocese of Alessandria (della Paglia) * Roman Catholic Diocese of Biella * Roman Catholic Diocese of Casale Monferrato * Roman Catholic Diocese of Novara.  History  * 300: Established as Diocese of Vercelli / Vercellen(sis) (Latin adjective) * Lost territories on 1474.04.18 to establish Diocese of Casale Monferrato and on 1772.06.01 to establish Diocese of Biella * Gained territory (back) on 1803.06.01 from the suppressed Diocese of Biella * Promoted on 1817.07.17 as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vercelli / Vercellen(sis) (Latin), having lost territory to (re-)establish Diocese of Biella * Lost territory on 1874.08.01 to suffragan daughter Diocese of Casale Monferrato According to an ancient lectionary the Gospel was first preached in Vercelli in the second half of the third century by Saints Sabinianus (Savinian) and Martialis, bishops from Gaul, when they were returning to their dioceses. The episcopal see was not established till after the Peace of Constantine. The first bishop was Saint Eusebius (354‚Äì370), a Sardinian lector of the Roman Church and a strenuous opponent of Arianism. From Vercelli the Gospel spread through the valley of the Po and its environs; towards the end of the fourth century, perhaps even during the episcopate of Saint Eusebius, new dioceses were erected. From Eusebius to Nottingo (830) there were forty bishops, whose images were preserved in the Eusebian basilica, predecessor of the present cathedral, so called because Saint Eusebius, who dedicated it to the martyr Saint Theonestus, was interred in it. He introduced the common and monastic life among his clergy, from whom bishops for the surrounding territory were often selected. In 1817 the Diocese of Vercelli, then suffragan of the archbishopric of Turin (but previously of the archbishopric of Milan) was made an archdiocese, the first archbishop being Giuseppe di Grimaldi. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, Secretary of State (2006 onwards) served as archbishop of Vercelli (1991‚Äì1995). * It enjoyed a Papal visit from Pope John Paul II in May 1998.

He joined the French Navy in 1804, where he was a cabin boy in the Boulogne fleet. Naval career He was the captain of the Inconstant from 1823 to 1825. He sailed her to Brazil, and remained her captain on station in Brazil. He was promoted to Commander (Capitaine de fr√©gate) in 1824. Du Petit- Thouars frequently travelled to Algeria, and had a decisive role in the conquest of Algiers, where he developed the attack plans. During the battle, he commanded the 20-gun Griffon. He was later put in charge of the Southern Seas command, in the Pacific Ocean. In 1834 he played a key role in protecting French shipping interests against the Peruvians. Meeting with Hawaiians in July 1837 He became \\"Capitaine de vaisseau\\" on 6 January 1834, and accomplished a circumnavigation between 1836 and 1839 on the frigate V√©nus. Also on board were the hydrographer Urbain Dortet of Tessan, the doctor- naturalist Adolphe Simon Neboux, and the surgeon Charles Ren√© Augustin L√©clancher. During this voyage the Marquesas were explored.

Agent X come close to being undone once by a woman who could recognise him no matter what his disguise. She turned out to be blind and recognised his manner of walking. Originally X was bank-rolled by an anonymous group of millionaires who made any amount of money he might need available. He maintained a number of identities and had bank-rolled a failing detective business into a thriving business where alongside their usual work, they did work for him, gathering news reports, getting information, leg work, guarding people, etc. They did not know his real identity. Later X became more of a mysterious government figure. His weapon of choice was a gas gun which quickly rendered people unconscious for a short time without any side effects. Although ostensibly in the crime genre, the Secret Agent X stories were situated at the more far-fetched end of the spectrum, with a number of science fiction elements such as futuristic weapons and mad scientists. They were generally given highly sensational titles such as The Ambassador of Doom (May 1934), Servants of the Skull (November 1934), The Golden Ghoul (July 1935), Satan‚Äôs Syndicate (August 1937) and Curse of the Crimson Horde (September 1938). There were a number of similarities between Secret Agent X and other pulp heroes of the time such as The Shadow, the Green Lama and Operator No. 5. Authors such as Tepperman and Rogers produced stories for Operator No. 5 magazine as well as for Secret Agent X. Ace Comics also published a short- lived character based on Secret Agent X, but called him \\"X- The Phantom Fed\\". All stories were based on early novels.

Fleming-Roberts Reprints & New Stories Several Secret Agent X novels have been reprinted over the years. In the 1960s, at the height of the camp craze and the success of the Doc Savage reprints, Corinth Press (an imprint of soft porn publisher Regency) issued seven Secret Agent X adventures in paperback. Their low distribution made them collector's items almost from the very first, but didn't generate enough sales to continue the series. Since then, several other small presses have reprinted different stories. Small press Altus Press has begun an ambitious reprinting of the entire Secret Agent \\"X\\" series in nine volumes. All nine volumes have appeared. Beginning in 1996 Secret Agent X became the latest in a series of pulp heroes to be revived. In Tom Johnson's short story \\"Horror's Monster,\\" published in Classic Pulp Fiction Stories #9, Agent X's saga moved into the early days of World War II. Here he squared off against criminals who employed giant spiders to achieve their nefarious ends. Since publication of Johnson's tale, Stephen Payne has penned three novels starring the Secret Agent: The Freezing Fiends (CPFS #12-17), Master of Madness (Double Danger Tales #1-3), and Halo of Horror (Double Danger Tales #21-23), all appearing under the aegis of Tom Johnson's Fading Shadows books. Halo of Horror and Master of Madness has since been reprinted in a pulp facsimile format by Altus Press. Altus Press has also published other Secret Agent X material: The Stolen Formula, a rewrite of a Secret Agent X story written specifically for the Greek audience and published in their \\"magazine\\" Triple Detective #1, and reprinted The Secret Agent X Companion, a comprehensive history of the character by Tom Johnson and Will Murray. In addition, Wild Cat Books issued two collections of novellas showcasing the Agent; Secret Agent X Volumes 1 & 2\\\\. These were edited by pulp historian/writer, Ron Fortier and are currently Airship 27 Productions and published by Cornerstone Books Publisher. It is a continuing series of all new stories with future volumes in production. The third, fourth, and fifth volumes have already appeared, with Frank Schildiner's take on the hero as the cover tale. Stephen Payne wrote a fourth new Secret Agent X novel, The Resurrection Ring, which revealed new facts about the origin of the Man of a Thousand Faces. It also starred some old friends and even an old enemy who had not been featured since the 1930s. Altus Press released it in Summer 2014, at Pulpfest. More recently, Payne has completed his fifth novel of the Secret Agent, League of the Seventh Son. Set in New Orleans in 1932, it will showcase an adventure from before the Agent's recorded career, wherein the Man of a Thousand Faces battles the terrible Mister Seven, a variant of an ancient European legend. In addition it will show the specific reason that Agent X faked his own death, in order to become a nameless, faceless crime-buster. The novel will premiere sometime in 2017. Payne is also writing his sixth novel, Agents of Apollyon. In this crossover tale set in 1938, X battles a 19th- century villain who has somehow survived to the 20th century. In the process the character has gained a deadly weapon with which he can bring the entire world to its knees. Payne will follow this novel with The Satan of the Sky, wherein the Agent faces an airborne menace in 1940 Phoenix. Future tales will include a pair of Cold War adventures: Fear's Flotilla and Time of the Terrible People. Also Payne is working on the outline for a story tentatively entitled Silence for Sale. In it the Man of a Thousand Faces will battle the Man of Silence, a weird villain who does not speak, but uses a form of sign language to communicate with his underlings. Age of Adventure published a full-length Secret Agent X novel set during World War II, The Sea Wraiths by Sean Ellis. This has been reprinted by Retrograde Press recently.

It has a population of around 7,200. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. History The settlement was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Petirwalde. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay tithe from was not yet precised). The walde (German for a wood) ending of its name indicates that the primordial settlers were of German origins. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as Petirswalde. After 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 26 March 1654. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

The two meanings are related in that in both, pages of memory may be in primary storage (RAM) or in secondary storage (disk); however, the current actual physical location of a page is unimportant to a process. It originally meant what is now usually called virtual memory, which was introduced in 1962 by the Atlas system at Manchester.One-Level Storage System, T. Kilburn, D.B.G. Edwards, M.J. Lanigan, F.H. Sumner, IRE Trans. Electronic Computers April 1962 Accessed 2014-Aug-07 It now usually refers to the organization of a computing system in which there are no files, only persistent objects (sometimes called segments), which are mapped into processes' address spaces (which consist entirely of a collection of mapped objects). The entire storage of the computer is thought of as a single two- dimensional plane of addresses (segment, and address within segment). The persistent object concept was first introduced by Multics in the mid-1960s, in a project shared by MIT, General Electric and Bell Labs.Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in Multics, Robert C. Daley, Jack B. Dennis Accessed 2014-Aug-07 It also was implemented as virtual memory, with the actual physical implementation including a number of levels of storage types. (Multics, for instance, had three levels: originally, main memory, a high- speed drum, and disks.) SLS is now most often associated with IBM i (formerly known as i5/OS or OS/400), the operating system of the IBM System i, although IBM first implemented SLS in 1978 in the System/38 and its Control Program Facility (CPF) operating system, the predecessor to IBM i.  Design  With a single-level storage the entire storage of a computer is thought of as a single two-dimensional plane of addresses, pointing to pages. Pages may be in primary storage (RAM) or in secondary storage (disk); however, the current location of an address is unimportant to a process. The operating system takes on the responsibility of locating pages and making them available for processing. If a page is in primary storage, it is immediately available. If a page is on disk, a page fault occurs and the operating system brings the page into primary storage. No explicit I/O to secondary storage is done by processes: instead, reads from secondary storage are done as the result of page faults; writes to secondary storage are done when pages that have been modified since being read from secondary storage into primary storage are written back to their location in secondary storage. System/38 and IBM i design IBM's design of the single-level storage was originally conceived and pioneered by Frank Soltis and Glenn Henry in the late 1970s as a way to build a transitional implementation to computers with 100% solid state memory. The thinking at the time was that disk drives would become obsolete, and would be replaced entirely with some form of solid state memory. System/38 was designed to be independent of the form of hardware memory used for secondary storage. This has not come to be, however, because while solid state memory has become exponentially cheaper, disk drives have also become similarly cheaper; thus, the price ratio in favour of disk drives continues: very much higher capacities than solid state memory, very much slower to access, and much less expensive. In IBM i, the operating system believes it has access to an almost unlimited storage array of 'real memory' (i.e., primary storage). An address translator maps the available real memory to physical memory, residing on disk drives (either 'spinning' or solid-state), or on a SAN server (such as the V7000). The operating system simply places an object at an address in its memory space. The OS \\"doesn't know\\" (or care) if the object is physically in memory or on a slower disk-storage device. The Licensed Internal Code, atop which the OS runs, handles page faults on object pages not in physical memory, reading the page into an available page frame in primary storage. With the IBM i implementation of single-level storage, page faults are divided into two categories. These are database faults and non-database faults. Database faults occur when a page associated with a relational database object like a table, view or index is not currently in primary storage. Non-database faults occur when any other type of object is not currently in primary storage. IBM i treats all secondary storage as a single pool of data, rather than as a collection of multiple pools (file systems), as is usually done on other operating systems such as systems like Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows. It intentionally scatters the pages of all objects across all disks so that the objects can be stored and retrieved much more rapidly. As a result, an IBM i server rarely becomes disk bound. Single-level storage operating systems also allow CPU, memory and disk resources to be freely substituted for each other at run time to smooth out performance bottlenecks.

(Bilbao, December 8, 1934 - Guatemala City, December 12, 2005) was a Jesuit priest, engineer, and activist, founder of Pro-B√∫squeda, an organization dedicated to searching for the missing children of the Salvadoran Civil War. He was a professor at Central American University (UCA), the Jesuit university of El Salvador, and escaped the massacre of the Jesuit community at the university in November 1989. Life Cortina was born in Bilbao, Spain, in 1934, but his family fled to France as refugees from the Spanish Civil War, later returning. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1954, at the age of 19. The following year, while still a novice, he was sent to serve in El Salvador. After a year in the mission there, he went to the United States to do his university studies, following by seminary studies in Germany. He was ordained a priest in 1968. He then returned to Spain, where he earned a Doctorate in Engineering from the Polytechnical University of Madrid in 1973. After completing his studies, Cortina was again sent to El Salvador, where he taught strength of materials and other civil engineering courses at the Jesuit university in San Salvador. In addition to his academic duties, he served as a priest for the small peasant villages surrounding the capital. During a period of military dictatorship supporting the Salvadoran elite, he and his fellow Jesuits taught peasant communities to stand up for their rights. The government's response was a \\"scorched earth\\" campaign against the peasant population, deemed either to be terrorists or their supporters, with widespread massacres of civilians, even children. The military also targeted the clergy who spoke up for human rights. When a fellow Jesuit, Rutilio Grande was murdered by government forces in 1977 while returning to his parish church in Aguilares, Archbishop √ìscar Romero (who was himself assassinated in 1980) appointed Cortina to succeed him as the pastor of the village. In this role, Cortina continued to be an outspoken critic of the government's repression of the rural population. Cortina continued to serve on the faculty of the university, where he kept his primary residence. On the night of 16 November 1989, however, he was at his rural parish. While driving back to the capital the next day, he heard on his car radio the news that all occupants of the Jesuit resident at the university had been executed overnight by a large contingent of government soldiers. This included six Jesuit priests who taught at the university as well as their housekeeper and her 16-year-old daughter. He heard his own name listed among the dead. International outrage over this massacre eventually pressured the government to work out a ceasefire with the guerrilla rebels they had been fighting. After the civil war came to an end in 1992, Cortina began to hear reports from refugees that many children were unaccounted for, their bodies not being among those slain in the massacres. He also heard rumors from soldiers that some of the children from these villages had been taken and later \\"sold\\" to childless couples from the United States and Europe who were looking to adopt. He then set up the organization Pro- B√∫squeda (For the Search) to try to locate these children. The group's policy was not to retrieve the children, but simply to locate them in order to provide their birth parents the comfort of knowing that their children were still alive. Initially simply using standard investigative techniques, the organization was eventually able to use DNA to trace the children. 1 Cortina died in 2005, of a massive stroke, while at a conference in Guatemala City. In 2007, he was posthumously awarded the Jaime Brunet international human rights award.Universidad P√∫blica de Navarra: Jon Cortina Garaigorta, Premio Internacional Jaime Brunet 2007.

Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within the 'Wookey and St Cuthbert Out West' electoral ward. The ward starts near Wells and stretches via St Cuthbert Out to Godney. The total population of this ward taken from the 2011 census was 2,510. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites St Matthew's church dates from the twelfth century and is a Grade I listed building. It was granted to the dean of Wells by Bishop Robert, rebuilt by Bishop Reginald and assigned to the sub dean of the cathedral in 1209. The south chancel is thought to have been built to house the memorial to Thomas Clerke in 1556. Beside the church stands the Mellifont Abbey, which was once home to Sir Jacob Wolff, 1st Baronet, where a monument to him and his wife can be seen in the church. Mellifont Abbey is named after the abbey of the same name in Ireland. Notable residents Wookey was the birthplace of the trade unionist A.J. Cook, and of Sir Arthur Pearson, the publisher and philanthropist.

A prominent hitman during the 1980s, Boriello participated in the 1990 murder of Gambino soldier Louis DiBono. Early years Boriello grew up in South Brooklyn, New York, surrounded by mobsters from the Gambino, Genovese, and Colombo crime families. His younger brother Stevie was a close friend of neighborhood gangsters Joseph \\"Crazy Joe\\" Gallo, Albert Gallo and Frank Illiano, and after Joey's murder, Stevie was instrumental in securing the crew's South Brooklyn rackets. A burly, 6-foot, 3-inch man, Boriello was a feared enforcer for the Gallo gang.  Gambino crime family  Between 1967 and 1972, Boriello was arrested six times, on charges of weapons possession, assault, larceny and gambling. In the 1980s, Boriello became a made man, or full member, in the Gambino family. He quickly developed close relationships with Gotti, Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano and two brothers, Nicholas Corozzo and Joseph \\"Jo Jo\\" Corozzo. Boriello and Gotti would often spend weekends together on Long Island, New York, partying, gambling, and attending performances by singer Jay Black, a childhood friend of Gotti. Boriello also conducted business at the One Over Golf Club, a social club in Carroll Gardens, operated by Gambino soldier Joseph \\"Joe Pits\\" Conigliaro, a paraplegic gangster involved in loan sharking and gambling in the neighborhood who was killed a few years ago. During his early days, Boriello was suspected in several gangland slayings, as well as involvement in extortion, loan sharking and drug trafficking.  Making ceremony  Former Gambino capo Michael \\"Mikey Scars\\" DiLeonardo testified that on December 24, 1988, he was led into an apartment located on Mulberry Street (the apartment belonged to Joe Butch Corrao's mother). Inside were the other men who were going to be inducted that evening, including Bobby Boriello, John Gotti, Jr., Dominick \\"Skinny Dom\\" Pizzonia, Craig DePalma and Nicholas LaSorsa. The men stood there with family capo John \\"Jackie Nose\\" D'Amico, along with other capo Gene Gotti. Sitting at the table, administering the oath was Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano, and Pasquale \\"Patsy\\" Conte.  Junior Gotti crew  After John Gotti promoted his son to capo at the behest of Sammy Gravano, and gave him his own crew, Gotti assigned Bobby Boriello to the Junior Gotti crew. Other crew soldiers included John \\"Jackie\\" Cavallo, Charles Carneglia, Thomas \\"Tommy Twitch\\" Cacciopoli, and later on the crew included Dominic \\"Fat Dom\\" Borghese, Vincent \\"Vinnie Butch\\" Corrao, Carmine Agnello, and Craig DePalma. The crew's associates included Steve Kaplan, Frank Lividisi, Michael McLaughlin, David Pietras, Jeff and Steve Dobies, John Ruggiero, John Alite, Louis Casaneti. Boriello's business dealings were conducted in Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, and throughout Brooklyn, especially South Brooklyn, where he associated with Gambino family wiseguys Angelo Paccione, Anthony \\"Toddo\\" Anastasio, Joseph Chirico, Anthony \\"Sonny\\" Ciccone, and many others, with interests in trucking, construction, and loan sharking. Steven Kaplan was paying Boriello and Junior Gotti tribute for his investments in strip clubs up and down the East Coast. In 1987, Boriello crew member and close associate Anthony \\"Shorty\\" Mascuzzio from Carroll Gardens was killed in a New York nightclub owned by Kaplan. Low level mob associate David Fisher had been in a physical altercation with Mascuzzio, over a business squabble, and ended up shooting him to death.  Promotion  Boriello, being the most powerful and closest ally to John Gotti in the crew, was appointed acting capo of the Junior Gotti crew. In December 1990, soon after Junior became a capo, his father was indicted and set up a 5-man ruling panel to which Junior was appointed. Boriello operated his rackets from his Brooklyn social club on Sackett Street where he was about to rechange the order of rank of crew members from club at the time he was killed.  Mob hit  In 1990, Gotti told Boriello to murder Gambino soldier Louis DiBono. DiBono had secured the lucrative contract to install fireproofing foam on the infrastructure of the Twin Towers of the New York World Trade Center. After DiBono's death, Gravano took over the business. On another occasion, Boriello unsuccessfully tried to kill Genovese crime family associate Preston Geritano on a Brooklyn street, firing shots at him in public. Since Geritano had relatives in Genovese crime family, Genovese and Gambino representatives met to discuss his fate. Eventually the Gambinos released Geritano to the Genovese with the condition that he be killed if he tried to retaliate against Boriello. In 2004 Geritano's own brother-in-law Andrew Gargiulo stabbed him to death in broad day light. Assassination On April 13, 1991, Boriello was shot to death outside his Bensonhurst, Brooklyn home, on orders from Lucchese crime family underboss Anthony Casso. Casso received information to perform the Boriello murder from Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, two New York City Police Department officers working for the mob. The hit was carried out by Lucchese captain Frank \\"Big Frank\\" Lastorino. Lastorino shot Boriello twice in the head, and five times in the torso. Boriello died in the street beside his 1991 Lincoln Town Car, outside his home on Bay 29th Street. Borriello's wife, Susan, and their two young children were inside the home at the time of the shooting. At the time of his murder, Boriello had been under investigation by multiple federal agencies and the Kings County District Attorney's Office for directing a cocaine trafficking conspiracy, as well as his suspected involvement in the murder of former family boss Paul Castellano. In fact, Gambino informant Dominick LoFaro, fingered Boriello as one of the shooters in the slaying, reasoning that Boriello had been one of the more accomplished \\"hitters\\" in the family. In jail at the time, Gotti ordered Gambino family members to meet with the leaders of the Genovese family after Boriello's assassination. Keeping to their earlier agreement, they agreed to kill Geritano. However, it wasn't until 2004 that Geritano was stabbed to death outside a Bay Ridge, Brooklyn restaurant by his brother-in-law Andrew Garguilo. Earlier that day, Preston broke Gargiulo's arm with a baseball bat. The murder was unrelated to Boriello's murder and it was later discovered that Lucchese captain Frank \\"Big Frank\\" Lastorino was ordered to kill Boriello as a message to Gotti. Sammy Gravano attended a sit-down with Genovese family acting boss Liborio Bellomo, seeking Geritano's execution. John Gotti sent word to Stevie Boriello that he had permission to avenge his brother's death by killing whomever he needed to, and had the backing of Gotti. Stevie Boriello remained involved with the family after his brother's death, handling loan sharking, gambling, and extortion rackets in Brooklyn and Staten Island, where he currently resides.

It was once known as \\"St. Mary of the Fertile Rock\\", a reference to the Burren's fertile soil. The Romanesque ruins feature stone carvings that are considered to be among the finest in a Cistercian church in Ireland. The abbey appears in W.B. Yeats' play The Dreaming of Bones. They constitute a National Monument and are open to the public. Geography Location The ruins are located around 800 metres east of the village of Bellharbour in Glennamannagh, a valley of the Burren. The closest large village is Ballyvaughan, a few miles further west. The L1014 road passes close by the abbey. About a kilometer from the abbey are the ruined churches of Oughtmama. Although no stream was present at the site, several wells are located in the townland where the abbey stands, which probably provided water to the monastic foundation. History View of Corcomroe from Oughtmama with Galway Bay in the background A band of Cistercian monks came to the area from the abbey at Inislounaght in County Tipperary in the late 12th century. Sources vary as to the exact founding date (1180‚Äì1200). The foundation is attributed either to Donal M√≥r Ua Briain (Donald O'Brien), the patron of a number of other religious structures in the historic Thomond region, who died in 1194 or his successor Donough Cairbreach. If it is true that Corcomroe established a daughter-house in 1198 at Kilshane (County Limerick) the former is more likely. Alternatively, Kilshane may have been the first attempt by this group of monks to set up a monastery and after that failed in 1200, Corcomroe may have been the site of their second try. On stylistic grounds, the founding is thought to have occurred around 1205‚Äì10. Construction of the abbey used local limestone. Legend maintains that the building was indeed commissioned by King Conor na Siudane Ua Briain (see below). According to the legend, Ua Briain executed the five masons who completed the abbey to prevent them from constructing a rival masterpiece elsewhere. The documentary evidence on Corcomroe Abbey is scanty. Moreover, since the Cistercians did not engage in pastoral work to the same extent as some other orders, few traditions on the abbey were maintained by local folklore. In 1226, a papal mandate addressed to the Bishop of Kilfenora and the abbot of Corcomroe shows that the abbey was integrated into the Cistercian network at that time and that the abbot was an important functionary in the local church. Another missive, from 1359, concerned the finances of the archdiocese of Tuam and the diocese of Kilmacduagh. In between, in 1228, the relationship with the mother-house at Inislounaght was ended and Corcomroe became subservient to Furness Abbey. This was part of an attempt by the order to bring the more remote houses of the order in Ireland under closer control. In 1227, 1280 and 1287 there were complaints that the abbot of Corcomroe had failed to appear at the General Chapter at Citeaux for a long time. According to a 15th-century report, in 1268 a battle was fought at Siud√°ine, close to Corcomroe in which Conor O'Brien (Conor na Siudane Ua Briain), King of Thomond was surprised by Conor Carrach O'Loughlain and slain with many of his retainers. His body was retrieved from the battlefield and buried at Corcomroe by the monks. Another battle reportedly took place nearby in 1317, when there was internal feuding between the O'Briens and their allies. The abbey was used as a barracks by Dermot O'Brien. By the end of the 14th century, the local area was held by a branch of the O'Cahans (O'Kane or Keane) from Derry in Ulster. It is not clear exactly how this occurred. Earlier that century, the wool trade had boomed but then fell into decline. Selling off/mortgaging land may have been a way tried by the abbey to improve its economic circumstances. In any case, the O'Cahans became stewards of the abbey's lands. Papal letters of the early 15th century refer to issues around appointments at Kilfenora and Killilagh. In 1419, the abbot John became Bishop of Kilmacduagh. Papal correspondence became more frequent after this time, mostly for reasons of local abuses of order rules notably the ban against marriage. Church dynasties had become quite common in Ireland at that time, and were also present at Corcomroe. Through the 15th century, the abbey and several parishes were controlled by the Tierney family. These practices of hereditary succession of abbots and use of abbey resources by powerful families resulted in a decline of monasteries' fortunes. The number of monks fell, monastic churches were reduced in size. At Corcomroe, the church was shortened by 13 metres in the 15th century. There is also evidence that suggests that at the time the monks' dormitory had been in disuse. The English Reformation led to the dissolution of Catholic monasteries in England and Ireland. In 1554, the abbey and its land (15 quarters) was granted to the Earl of Thomond/Baron Inchiquin, Murrough O'Brien. The property is last mentioned in the family papers in 1702, when they were mortgaged By William, Earl of Inchiquin to Donat O'Brien of Dromoland. The monks continued to tend the fields and maintain the abbey as circumstances allowed, but the political climate led to continued decline. In 1625, Father Daniel O'Griffy of Dysert O'Dea Monastery was appointed as \\"commendatory abbot\\" of Corcomroe, but that may have been purely titular. This was also true of the last abbot, the Reverend John O'Dea, a monk of Salamanca, appointed in 1628. In 1879, the Office of Public Works acquired the ruins.

The construction used the standard plan of Cistercian foundations, but on a reduced scale. The cruciform church, facing east, features just one side chapel in each transept and a small cloister court. The church, though lacking a roof, is largely intact with an aisled nave (of which the north aisle has all but disappeared or was never completed). Of the abbey's domestic buildings only a few traces remain. However, significant pieces of the high wall surrounding the five acre monastic precinct are still visible. The arched gate through this wall was blown down by a storm in 1839. Its remains and those of a gatehouse lie about 100 meters west of the church. The abbey is noted for its detailed carvings and other rich ornamentation, which are not commonly found in structures from this period. This includes columns, capitals and ribs that support the vaulted sanctuary (or choir) ceiling. The sanctuary also contains the tomb of Conor O'Brien (or Conor na Siudane Ua Briain), King of Thomond, located in an arched recess. The limestone effigy (close to life size) is one of the few contemporary representations of an Irish chieftain. Although vandalised in the early 19th century, the monument is in fairly good condition. A late addition is the Neoclassical \\"O'Loughlin King of the Burren Family Tomb\\", from the late 18th or early 19th century. It is located in the floor in front of the recess with Conor O'Brien's tomb. Today The abbey today is a tourist attraction and is accessible to the public.

When these arteries then reach the white pulp, and become covered with periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths, the name changes again to central arteries (or central arterioles). Branches of the central arteries are given to the red pulp, and these are called penicillar arteries). Details The lienal artery is remarkable for its large size in proportion to the size of the organ, and also for its tortuous course. It divides into six or more branches, which enter the hilum of the spleen and ramify throughout its substance, receiving sheaths from an involution of the external fibrous tissue. Similar sheaths also invest the nerves and veins. Each branch runs in the transverse axis of the organ, from within outward, diminishing in size during its transit, and giving off in its passage smaller branches, some of which pass to the anterior, others to the posterior part. These ultimately leave the trabecular sheaths, and terminate in the proper substance of the spleen in small tufts or pencils of minute arterioles, which open into the interstices of the reticulum formed by the branched sustentacular cells. Each of the larger branches of the artery supplies chiefly that region of the organ in which the branch ramifies, having no anastomosis with the majority of the other branches. The arterioles, supported by the minute trabeculae, traverse the pulp in all directions in bundles (penicilli) of straight vessels. Their trabecular sheaths gradually undergo a transformation, become much thickened, and converted into adenoid tissue; the bundles of connective tissue becoming looser and their fibrils more delicate, and containing in their interstices an abundance of lymph corpuscles. The altered coat of the arterioles, consisting of adenoid tissue, presents here and there thickenings of a spheroidal shape, the white pulp. The arterioles end by opening freely into the splenic pulp; their walls become much attenuated, they lose their tubular character, and the endothelial cells become altered, presenting a branched appearance, and acquiring processes which are directly connected with the processes of the reticular cells of the pulp. In this manner the vessels end, and the blood flowing through them finds its way into the interstices of the reticulated tissue of the splenic pulp. Thus the blood passing through the spleen is brought into intimate relation with the elements of the pulp, and no doubt undergoes important changes.

He was appointed City Engineer and Surveyor for Bradford in January 1946. Wardley House, the building that houses the National Media Museum among other things, was named after him. Redevelopment Wardley's vision was for a new city 'with provision for a continuous self-regulating flow of traffic', and the buildings that were erected were modernist. The local sandstone was rejected as a building material. Many much-loved buildings were demolished to make way for the 'city of the future', and there was eventually considerable opposition. J. B. Priestley and David Hockney were among those who protested in vain against the demolition of the Swan Arcade in 1962. In 2005 one of the icons of Wardley's redevelopment, Forster House, was demolished as part of the 'Broadway development' (see Forster Square, Bradford). Other recent changes have seen reversals of 1960s planning in Bradford, e.g. filling in of pedestrian under-passes and promotion of traffic-calming measures, and attempts to promote residential use of the city centre, as opposed to 1960s zoning.

Biography He was born at Dubno, Volhynia, then Kingdom of Poland. When he was 14 years old his parents married him to the daughter of the Talmudist Simhah ben Joshua of Volozhin. Having exhausted the knowledge of his Volhynian instructors, Dubno went to Galicia, studying there for several years Biblical exegesis and grammar under the direction of Rabbi Solomon of Cholm. Dubno soon became proficient in these branches of Jewish science, and was charged by his master with the revision and publication of his work on the Hebrew accents, Sha'are Ne'imah (Frankfort- on-the-Main, 1766). From 1767 to 1772 Dubno lived at Amsterdam, attracted by its rich collections of Hebrew books. On leaving Amsterdam he settled in Berlin, earning a livelihood by teaching. Among his pupils was the son of Moses Mendelssohn, who, highly appreciating Dubno's scholarship, became his patron and friend. Dubno wrote a commentary for Mendelssohn's translation of the book of Genesis. This was published in the first volume of Mendelssohn translation of the Pentateuch. In 1782‚Äì3, he spent about six months in Wilno, living with the wealthy Jewish financier Joseph Pesseles. (He alludes to this in his work Birkath Yosef, published at Dyhernfurth, 1783.) After the death of Mendelssohn, Dubno stopped for a short time in Frankfort-on-the-Main, and then returned to Amsterdam. There, at first f√™ted, and later ignored, deriving a scanty income from the loan of the books from his rich library, he remained until his death on June 26, 1813. Other works In addition to the works mentioned above, Dubno wrote the following: * Poems, appearing (p. 34) among those of Immanuel, published by L√∂b Wolf at Berlin, 1776; in the Bikkure To'elet (pp. 4, 114), published by the Anshe To'elet Society of Amsterdam; and in Heidenheim's Sefer ·∏≤erobot. * Ebel Ya·∏•id, an elegy on the death of Jacob Emden, published at Berlin, 1776. * A preface to Moses ·∏§ayyim Luzzatto's poem La-Yesharim Tehillah, ib. 1780. * A work on the geography of Palestine, promised by him in his commentary on Genesis, where he displayed a profound knowledge of the subject. Luncz (Jerusalem, 1892, pp. 137 et seq.) identifies this work with the Ahabat ·∫íiyyon of Dubno's father-in-law, Sim·∏•ah ben Joshua, but as this is a mere plagiarism from the Karaite Samuel ben David's story of his voyage to Palestine, published in Gurland's Ginze Yisrael, it is probable that Lehren (Catalogue, p. 247) is right in doubting the identification. * Reshimah (Register), catalogue of his library, published at Amsterdam, 1814. It contains 2,076 printed works and 106 manuscripts. * Dubno left a great number of essays, poems, etc., which are still extant in manuscript.

Biography Cytter, born 22 August 1977, spent her childhood in Israel and went on to study visual arts at the Avni Institute of Art and Design, Tel Aviv. After finding success in various galleries in her home country, she moved to Amsterdam on a scholarship from De Ateliers where she studied with Willem de Rooij and Marlene Dumas.Keren Cytter biography . Noga Gallery Her scope of work includes film, video installations, performance, drawings and photography. She is also a writer of novels, theatre plays and poetry. Work Video Art Cytter is best known for her textually based video art. Her narratives, although extremely fragmented, have a tendency to embody the post-modern self-awareness of the characters in her films. Through the development and execution of Cytter's unique style, she has found herself a niche in the art world which has brought her more and more critical attention and made her one of the most renowned artists of her generation.\\"[citation needed]\\" After graduating from De ateliers in Amsterdam, Cytter made several works which went on to be shown internationally including The Date Series (2004, a series of short narratives written, filmed and produced in the period of one year), The Victim (2006), Repulsion (2005, based on Polanski's Repulsion), and The Milk Man (2003). Among her most famous work is Der Spiegel from 2007. In just one long shot she stages a Shakespearean drama in a stripped contemporary Berlin apartment in which a middle-aged woman is forced to confront the realities of her fading sexual attractiveness by a sadistic pair of younger women. Four Seasons (2009) is another example of essential Cytter: the absurdist low-fi mixture of a variety of film genres, from Film noir to Melodrama, culminates in the iconic shot of a burning Christmas tree set to the dramatic music of Ferrante & Teicher.Keren Cytter - Four Seasons . Schau Ort. Dance and Theatre In 2008 Cytter formed a dance company called D.I.E NOW (Dance International Europe Now) consisting of 5 non- professional dancers. Their first production History in the Making - The True Story of John Webber, which was based on a wide range of influences including Pina Bausch, Samuel Beckett, Disney on Ice, Michael Jackson, Yvonne Rainer and the 1980s dance-floor filler Lambada, went on an international tour and was presented in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in London, The Kitchen in New York City, Tramway in Glasgow and Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin.Keren Cytter on D.I.E NOW Mousse MagazineKeren Cytter at HAU Berlin Texte zur Kunst The same year the British magazine Art Review ran a cover story on her entitled \\"I just wanted to attract attention\\".Keren Cytter Portrait Art Review She initiated her foundation APE - art projects era together with Dutch curator Maaike Gouwenberg in 2010. The aim of the organization is to develop projects (performances, exhibitions, printed matter, meetings) that cannot necessarily be realized within traditional institutional formats or frameworks.About APE. art projects era Later that year she wrote and directed the play Show Real Drama, produced by APE and partly based on the lives of its two actors, Susanne Meyer and Fabian Stumm. In the piece, which uses videos and repetitive dialogue and movements creating a fractured yet empathetic storyline, they are struggling with the demanding entertainment business while their relationship is slowly falling apart. The production met with great success, the Houston Chronicle calling it \\"intriguing (...) something deconstructionist architect Frank Gehry might conjure if he were a playwright; a story pulled apart at the seams then re-configured with cool wit and 21st-century angst.\\" As of 2014, the play has been performed all around the world from London, New York City and Houston to Shanghai, Beijing and Seoul.Show Real Drama art projects eraShow Real Drama Review Houston ChronicleShow Real Drama Review Tip Berlin In the spring of 2010 her work was featured on the cover of the American Art Magazine Artforum, which ran an extensive story on her body of work.True Lies - The Art of Keren Cytter Artis Contemporary/Artforum Her next play Anke is Gone or I Eat Pickles At Your Funeral opened in Berlin at Hebbel am Ufer in 2011 and was invited to the Images Festival Toronto in 2012.Keren Cytter Images Festival In 2013 Cytter collaborated with musicians Keira Fox, Charlie Feinstein and David Aird on Vociferous, a fluid combination of musical concert, video work and performance which was presented at the ICA Institute of Contemporary Art, London. Adrian Searle wrote in his The Guardian review: \\"As a mix of live performance and video, the recent collaboration between Adam Curtis and Massive Attack at the Manchester International Festival set a standard. Vociferous is both more intimate, more alienating, and more of a mash-up (...) After a bit I gave up trying to follow anything like a story, if there was one, or to chase the projected imagery, which came and went intermittently, first on one screen, then another. I felt a bit of a berk, running through the crowd with a notebook, trying to keep up, like an undercover cop blowing my own cover. Towards the end, Fox and Feinstein take up the electronic drums, and Fox starts singing from a ragged sheet of lyrics, the music hitting such a pitch that my nostril-hairs start to vibrate in sympathy.\\"Keren Cytter's Vociferous The Guardian Recent projects After six years in Berlin, Cytter relocated to New York City in 2012 where she initiated a quarterly publication focusing on art and poetry. Published by APE, it has so far featured Nora Schultz, John Kelsey and writings of Josef Strau, Matthew Dickman, Roman Baembaev, Roger van Voorhees and Sylvia Mae Gorelick.Publications art projects era Her 2013 solo exhibition at Pilar Corrias Gallery in London presented an ambitious new body of work called MOP (Museum of Photography) - a large archive of Polaroid photographs documenting her life as she travelled from Berlin and London, to the United States and Israel from 2012 to 2013. Taken with her 1200i and One step 600 Polaroid camera, the photographs are carefully categorised by geography and chronology and then arranged into sub-sections, titled A, B, C and D and so on, via their aesthetic. Images of friends, colleagues, curators she encountered, museums she worked in, landscapes she passed through, and her own performances are all featured. The collection consists of more than 800 polaroids.Keren Cytter and her 800 polaroids Another Mag In May 2019, Cytter had her first institutional solo presentation in Israel, titled ‚ÄúSponsored Content.‚Äù The exhibition carries a deep autobiographical tone, although, as always in her work, this very tone is hinted and suggested, avoiding any direct references. For this exhibition, which is articulated in two galleries, the artist has conceived an immersive display that invites the viewer to have an unusual physical encounter with her work, generating a space for reflection, bringing up all the different life stages, from childhood to teenage, from adulthood to middle age, till old age. ‚ÄúKeren Cytter: Sponsored Content‚Äù is curated by Nicola Trezzi and it follows ‚ÄúMature Content,‚Äù her exhibition at Museion in Bolzano (Italy) curated by Letizia Ragaglia.

He is principally known for the links he created between French and Japanese art, in both painting and ceramics. Early life Collin studied at the school of Saint-Louis, then went to Verdun where he was at school with Jules Bastien-Lepage; they became close friends. Collin then went to Paris and studied in the atelier of Bouguereau and then joined Lepage at Alexandre Cabanel's atelier where they both worked alongside Fernand Cormon, Aim√© Morot and Benjamin Constant. Collin painted still-lives, nudes, portraits and genre pieces, and preferred to render his subjects en plein air with a clear and luminous palette. Career Around 1873 he began successfully exhibiting at the Salon. He won a number of prizes that helped launch his career, and before long he was receiving increasingly prestigious commissions to paint large scale murals in major public buildings around Paris, including some of the most prominent cultural centers of Paris: the H√¥tel de Ville, the Th√©atre de l'√©on, and the Op√©ra-Comique. He provided designs for decorative plates made by Th√©odore Deck. Collin's early work closely followed the essential tenets of French academism. Like the Renaissance painters they admired, the nineteenth- century academicians used historical, religious, or allegorical painting to communicate an idea. Within the parameters of this literary art, Collin made subtle modifications to the accepted academic style, introducing elements of the impressionist technique into his allegorical scenes. Such formal techniques as formal composition and bright color evoked the light filled landscapes of impressionism rather than the dark chiaroscuro of Renaissance painting. During the last few decades of the nineteenth century, academic painting in France was in crisis, eclipsed by the new artistic movements of impressionism and symbolism. Collin's friendship with members of the impressionists provided him with insights into the new direction contemporary painting was taking. He adapted his work accordingly and in such paintings as Young Woman, he found a compromise between the academic style and the new painterly innovations of the impressionists and the Nabis. Collin began to emphasize the picture surface by reducing the spatial depth of his paintings as well as composing with areas of concentrated color. Yet he never completely abandoned the hallmarks of academicism: allegory and naturalism. Daphnis et Chlo√© Collin figured prominently in artistic exchanges between Paris and Tokyo during the late nineteenth century as Kuroda Seiki, Kume Keiichir≈ç, and Okada Sabur≈çsuke, among others, studied in his studio and at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, where Collin was associated. Kuroda and Kume, who subsequently assumed professorships at the Tokyo Fine Arts School (Tokyo Bijutsu Gakk≈ç), were especially instrumental in introducing to Japan Collin's academic teaching methods as well as the lighter palette, brushwork, and plein air approach he espoused. This mentorship of the first generation of Japanese oil painters contributed to the special respect he continues to enjoy in Japan. Collin also illustrated many books, notably Daphnis and Chlo√© (1890) and Chansons de Bilitis (1906).

Its origins can be traced back to the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies in 1833. The league emphasized moral reform and self-help, aiming \\"to encourage sound morality, education, temperance, frugality, industry, and promote everything that pertains to a well-ordered and dignified life.\\" Black leaders formed state and local branches of the league which drew many members, which caused the society to grow quickly, in areas such as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where people such as Thomas Morris Chester joined. Organizational history Origins As a result of the 1833 British West Indies emancipation, a large celebration of pro-abolitionist, free black men was held in Buffalo, New York. During this celebration, planning began for the creation of a wholly black organization to fight for the human rights for blacks in the United States. Ten years later, in 1843, after the establishment of several state conventions, the first National Convention of Colored Men of America was held in Buffalo with several hundred delegates, free black men and escaped slaves, from throughout the U.S. At this convention, the Chairman Samuel H. Davis defined their purpose: > \\"... we wish to secure for ourselves, in common with other citizens, the > privilege of seeking our own happiness in any part of the country we choose > ... unconstitutionally denied us in part of this union. We wish also to > secure the elective franchise in those states where it is denied us - where > are rights are legislated away, and our voice is neither heard nor regarded. > We also wish to secure, for our children especially, the benefits of > education, which in several States are entirely denied to us, and in others, > are enjoyed only in name. These, and many other things, of which we justly > complain, bear most heavily upon us as a people; and it is our right and our > duty to seek for redress, in that way which will lead most likely the > desired end.\\" Buffalo Evening News, April 3, 1973, page B3. The NERL founding members included Henry Highland Garnet, Fredrick Douglass, and John Mercer Langston. The organization originated in New York but quickly expanded at the conclusion of the civil war. Several resolutions were passed endorsing the abolition of slavery, legal equality regardless of color or race, and black manhood suffrage. The members also wrote their own constitution and founded the National Equal Rights League (NERL), and its subsidiary state Equal Rights Leagues. The NERL used the susu economics practices of its many West Indies immigrant members to fund its activities, which included the establishment of self-sufficient black communities (Black Wall Streets) throughout the U.S. The work of the membership of the NERL created such other organizations as the National Negro Business League, the National Negro Bar Association, and the Pan-African Conference. The NERL also had significant international influence. Its leadership was received by heads of state, and they even had a delegate attend the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The two best-known leaders of the organization were John Mercer Langston and William Monroe Trotter. Other notable members included Madam C.J. Walker, Ida B. Wells-Barnett (who founded its Anti-Lynching Bureau), Mary Church Terrell, Marcus Garvey, Octavius V. Catto, Charles Lewis Reason, John Rock, William Cooper Nell, Moses Dickson, and Frederick Douglass. Formation of a rival organization In 1905, NERL leaders met with other black leaders, in what is now known as the Niagara Movement, to discuss the growing debate between followers of Booker T. Washington and followers of W. E. B. Du Bois, who called for an end to discrimination, and to develop a new strategy for dealing with race relations at the turn of the 20th century. At this meeting, Du Bois unsuccessfully tried to convince the NERL members present, Trotter and Wells-Barnett, that white Americans should be permitted to join the NERL. When his pleas went unheeded, Du Bois left the organization and joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. With the continued growth of the NAACP, the NERL lost prominence and by 1921 most members had joined the NAACP.

It was created on 30 July 1641 for the politician William Strickland. The first baronet was summoned to Oliver Cromwell's House of Lords as Lord Strickland. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Beverley during the Commonwealth. The third baronet was a politician and racehorse owner. The fourth baronet was also a politician and served as Secretary at War from 1730 to 1735. The first through fifth baronets all sat in Parliament. The seventh baronet was a barrister and Whig politician. He married Mary, daughter and heiress of Reverend Charles Constable, of Wassand. In 1865, he succeeded to the substantial estates of Nathaniel Cholmley and assumed the same year by Royal permission the surname of Cholmley in lieu of his patronymic for himself and those of his heirs male who may succeeded to the Cholmley estates. However, his son and successor, the eighth Baronet, kept the surname Strickland. The ninth baronet became a Czechoslovakian citizen and was known as the \\"Anarchist Baronet\\" for his radical views. Since the tenth Baronet succeeded to the title in 1938, the baronets have used the surname of Strickland-Constable, which his grandfather (third son of the seventh baronet) had adopted by royal licence in 1803 to succeed to his maternal grandfather's estates. The first baronet's grandfather, navigator William Strickland, acquired the manor of Boynton in 1549 and the quarries at Hildenley, where the family built a mansion. Walter Strickland, younger brother of the first baronet, was a politician and diplomat. Another member of the family to gain distinction was Henry Strickland (1873‚Äì1934), fourth son of the eighth baronet. He was a Captain in the Royal Navy. The Boynton estate remained in the family until the 1950s. The stone-built Boynton Hall dates to the 15th century and Sir William Strickland, 4th Baronet was largely responsible for the interior refurbishment and landscapes of the present-day gardens.

The seven stone houses and several accompanying structures in the 10-acre National Landmark Historic District were likely built in the early 18th century by Huguenot settlers fleeing discrimination and religious persecution in France and what's now southern Belgium. After negotiating with the Esopus Indians, this small group of Huguenots settled on a flat rise on the banks of the Wallkill River in 1678. The settlers named the site in honor of Die Pfalz, the region of present-day Germany that had provided them temporary refuge before they came to America.Eric J. Roth, \\"History of New Paltz\\", New York History, 1989, Issue 4, at History Cooperative Recent archaeological finds indicate that the immediate area settled by the Huguenots was occupied by Native Americans prior to European contact. The site is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the United States. The house museums of Historic Huguenot Street are in their original village setting. The street has been included in the National Register of Historic Places since the Register was created in 1966, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and In addition to the houses, the site features a burying ground dating to the earlier 18th century, a reconstructed 1717 stone church, a visitor center, a library and archives, and spaces for other programming. The site is owned and operated by Historic Huguenot Street (HHS), which was founded in 1894. In 1899, Historic Huguenot Street purchased the Jean Hasbrouck House as the first house museum on the street. In the 1950s and 60s, the organization and related family associations purchased most of the remaining stone houses in the district and subsequently opened them as museums. These acquisitions were funded in large part by descendants of the original Huguenot founders. Their family associations play a key role in supporting the institution today. In the 1980s, the organization began offering related educational and informative programming to the public‚Äîwhich it continues to do today. The site is open to the public and programming is offered year-round. \\"In the Moment\\" interpretations, delivered by staff in authentic historical clothing, are now part of the core experience, along with other types of programming. Visit the official website for current schedules & rates. Individual houses Bevier-Elting House Bevier-Elting House Dating to the very early 18th century, the house was originally a one-room building built with the narrow or gable end facing the street‚Äîthen the prevailing style of the low countries of Northern Europe. Two expansions were built later, as was a small cellar that was used to house African slaves. The house was built by the Bevier family, one of the founding families, and subsequently sold to the Dutch Elting family. Abraham Hasbrouck House The Abraham (Daniel) Hasbrouck House The structure known as the Abraham Hasbrouck House was built in three phases in the 1720s and 30s. The first room of the house‚Äîthe center room‚Äîwas constructed in 1721 by Daniel Hasbrouck, the son of Abraham Hasbrouck the patentee. The date 1721 is based on recent dendrochronology, which is a process by which wooden structural members are dated. This house represents a New World innovation in Dutch-style architecture. The initial houses in the Dutch region of New York, such as New Amsterdam, Albany, and Kingston, were built in the tradition of Dutch cities, with the gable-ends to the street, which conserves street frontage. The basic structure of the house consists of a series of H-bents which spread the weight of the house across the entire expanse. The original one-room house exhibited several defining elements of Dutch architecture, the jambless fireplace being the principal and most recognized feature in the house. Recently re-opened to the public in July 2012 following a restoration and reinterpretation focusing on the life of Widow Wyntje. Jean Hasbrouck House The Jean Hasbrouck House Also built in 1721 by Jean's son Jacob (and perhaps incorporating elements of an early home built by New Paltz founder Jean Hasbrouck), this home is an excellent example of Hudson Valley Dutch architecture and the showpiece of Historic Huguenot Street. A National Historic Landmark in its own right, it boasts the only remaining original jambless fireplace of any of the Huguenot Street houses, and is one of the few surviving examples in what was formerly the New Netherland. In 2006, the north wall of the house was carefully dismantled, repaired and reconstructed. Reproduction Dutch-style casement windows were installed. Interior restoration followed, resulting in a house that is an excellent example of how a comfortable family in the region lived in the mid-18th century. DuBois Fort Louis DuBois House (aka the DuBois Fort) built 1705. Pictured circa 1900. Built ca 1705 for the DuBois family, it might have served as a fortified place for protection for the small community if needed. Originally a smaller 1¬Ω story structure, this building was expanded to its current size in the late 1830s. Some historians and antiquarians believe that the presence of \\"gun ports\\" made it a fort, but there is no evidence of the presence of any such portholes before the 19th century. The DuBois Fort currently serves as the orientation center and gift shop, as well as a location for special events. Guests can purchase their admission tickets and memberships at this building. Over the last 300 years, it has also been used as a residence and a restaurant. Freer House The Freer House is one of the six 18th-century stone houses owned by Historic Huguenot Street. It was altered in various points in its approximately 250 years of occupancy, with its most recent major alterations occurring in 1943 when it was purchased by Rev. John Wright Follette, a direct descendant of its original builder, Hugo Freer. Over the years, the interior was modernized into a 20th-century idea of a colonial home. This structure is not currently open to the public. Deyo House Deyo House (circa 1720) with large nineteenth century addition The original portion of the house was built around 1720 by Patentee Pierre Deyo. It began as a one-room house, was subsequently expanded to two rooms, and ultimately to three when a stone addition was added off the rear by Pierre's grandson Abraham. Circumstances for this house changed dramatically when, at the height of the Colonial Revival movement, two descendants of Pierre Deyo, Abraham and Gertrude Brodhead, inherited the house. Wanting to live on the street of their ancestors but also wanting a modern, gracious home that reflected their affluence, the Brodheads partially dismantled the original stone house and built a grand Queen Anne home around it in 1894. They also significantly changed their surrounding property, in essence changing a small, village farm into a handsomely appointed and landscaped mini-estate. The house first passed out of Deyo family ownership in 1915. It was a private home until 1971, when it was purchased by the Deyo Family Association and donated in order to be opened to the public as a house museum. The home was most recently restored in 2003 and features circa 1915 interiors. The patentee Pierre Deyo died in 1700, so couldn't have built the house in 1720 as stated. Per the plaque mounted outside the house it was built in 1692.  Crispell Memorial French Church Reconstructed French Reformed Church of 1717, and burying ground Current (1839) church building used by the Reformed congregation founded in 1678 Since the community's founding, there have been four sanctuaries built on what is today called Huguenot Street. The French-speaking Protestants who settled New Paltz built their first church in 1683‚Äîa simple log building. This was replaced in 1717 with a straightforward, square stone building that reflected the permanence of the settlement. The existing building in the burying ground is a highly conjectural reconstruction of the 1717 building near its original location. As the New Paltz community increased in size throughout the 18th century, a larger church became necessary. A second stone church was built down the street in 1772. When it became too small, it was demolished and replaced by a third church built in 1839. This church survives today and is home to an active Reformed congregation. The reconstructed church is named in honor of Antoine Crispell, one of the twelve founders or patentees of New Paltz. It was built as the result of a fundraising campaign led by the Crispell Family Association. The Crispell Family Foundation opted to create this reconstructed church in their ancestor's honor. It was completed in 1972. The 1717 church was designed to reflect Reform thinking: the pulpit was placed in a central location, and the pews were placed so that everyone could see and hear more equally. This expressed the concept that each person had a direct relationship with God, rather than one mediated through a church hierarchy. LeFevre House Built in 1799 by Ezekiel Elting, a prosperous merchant who was born in the Bevier- Elting House, this stone and brick building is quite different from the earlier stone houses on Huguenot Street. Its Georgian-style architecture reflects the transition of New Paltz from a French and Dutch settlement to an Anglo-American community, and increasing refinement in architecture in this period as settlements matured. The house shows the changes in architectural style from the early 18th century. This house reflects the several changes in the society and home life of New Paltz in the early 19th century. Deyo Hall Formerly a glass factory, Deyo Hall is the site of event and meeting facilities and public restrooms. Collections storage is also housed in this building. Roosa House Library and Archives Located in the Roosa House, the Library and Archives at Historic Huguenot Street is a research facility devoted primarily to the history and genealogy of the Huguenot and Dutch Settlers of the Hudson Valley. It also functions as a general repository for local history, regardless of ethnicity or religious persuasion. The collections consist of family genealogies, church, cemetery and bible records, wills and deeds, census records, genealogical periodicals, county histories, and publications relating to Huguenot ancestry. Genealogists, local historians, and other interested parties can access the collections by appointment. The colorful paint replicates the original colors of the house in 1891. Native American presence on Huguenot Street Historians and archeologists have learned more about the continuing relations between the Esopus, the original inhabitants of the area, and the Huguenots. Some results of research can be found at the HHS site at \\"Relations between the Huguenots of New Paltz, NY and the Esopus Indians .The \\"Before Hudson\\" exhibit, currently on view at the DuBois Fort Visitor Center, shows some of the highlights of archaeological excavation in our area with artifacts dating back 6,000-8,000 years ago. Slavery in New Paltz The historical record of slavery in New Paltz begins in 1674, three years before its founding, when Louis DuBois purchased two African slaves at a public auction held in Kingston (then called Esopus). The two slaves ran away the following spring and were captured in the colony by Lewis Morris of Barbados. From 1675 to 1680, Morris and DuBois engaged in a lengthy custody battle for the two slaves. Settlers continued to buy slaves to serve as laborers in New Paltz to support the settlement's growth. The Deyo family bought slaves in 1680 and 1694. Throughout the next 125 years, historical records of the settlement included references to slaves. In 1703, the population included nine slaves out of a total of 130 residents. Jean and Jacob Hasbrouck owned several slaves; they were named in Jean's will as \\"Gerritt,\\" \\"James,\\" and \\"Molly.\\"1712 Jean Hasbrouck Will document (accessed August 18, 2008) By 1755, slavery was a well-established part of the New Paltz community: the census from that year lists 28 slave holders, who collectively owned 78 slaves over the age of 14 years. The majority of slave holders (82%) owned between one and four slaves, and used them as domestic servants and farm laborers.\\"The Society of Negroes Unsettled\\": The History of Slavery in New Paltz, NY, Huguenot Street Society The overall population of New Paltz grew rapidly to 2,309 in 1790, by when 77 slave holders owned a total of 302 slaves, or 13% of the population.

It was developed by TalonSoft in conjunction with Volition, who later took the then unfinished beta and ported it for launch on the PlayStation 2 under the name Red Faction. The game went into development in late 1999, it used a new type of geographic software called \\"re-flex\\" (renamed Geo-Mod by Volition) which allowed the integration of fully destructible level maps. It also took the physics engine from the highly successful Unreal, series as well as its graphics engine, with some key tweaks, that allowed the game to take full advantage of the Dreamcast power, with limited slowdowns and no in-level loading, a problem that plagued the PS2 release of Red Faction. It also took advantage of the Dreamcast's online support at the time, allowing up to 8 people to take part in an online version of the game's mission mode, as well as up to 18 people in the online arena brawl. It also incorporated a 2 player mission mode as well as support for four player battle modes. Story The game takes place in a fictional universe during a galactic cold war between the GFR (Galactic Federation of Republics) and the GUSP (Galactic Union of Socialist Planets). The GUSP has been in opposition to the Galactic Senates allowance of the GFR to set up labor colonies in the Orion system, which had been determined part of the GUSP's territory after the GFR-backed invasion of the Degas system which the GUSP successfully repelled. The conditions in the labor camps have worsened over the past 5 years as the guards begin to crack down on miners who have begun to openly speak of revolution, as well as killing random laborers to keep the others in line. The tension between the guards and the laborers is at boiling point, and it appears that a revolution is the only way for the laborers to free themselves, and for the GUSP to push the GFR out of their backyard. The story starts deep in an underground mining facility on the distant planet of Oovoo IV (in the Orion system) were the main character is resting in the barracks with the other miners, when there is a large explosion followed by heavy gunfire. A group of rebel miners break down the doors to the barracks and proceed to distribute weapons to the slightly shaken miners who eagerly join the revolt. The player attempts to enlist other miners, and fights the guards to reach the surface, and head toward the rebel outpost. Once the player reaches the rebel base it is revealed that the team of laborers that helped liberate Mine 4 (M-4) were aided by a team of GUSP mercenaries, and that the GFR is sending troops to help suppress the miner rebellion on Oovoo IV before it spreads to the neighboring planets in the system. Characters Sgt. James Mcloud (Playable character): Leader of the GUSP mercenaries, a veteran of numerous military engagements (chiefly the defence of the Degas system) Sgt. Mcloud is not afraid to use military tactics that are frowned upon in the GFR's world of \\"civilized combat\\". Fara Sopot: Female leader of the rebel uprising, Fara is not afraid to get her hands dirty and is quite often seen leading troops into the fray. Although she usually butts heads with Sgt. Mcloud she seems to have a soft spot for him and vice versa. Victor Ryhnhold (Playable character): Main character witnesses the murder of his best friend at the hands of power drunken guards. Re-Flex One of the major software developments for Project: Revolution was the Re-Flex geographic software which unlike past games which only allowed limited level alteration via scripted events in the game, or specifically pre-rendered sections of the level, allowed unlimited alteration of the environment. This was possible because of the way it designates altered (or \\"Re-flexed\\") areas. Whereas other game engines would have to modify the shape of the altered object to create a similar effect, Re-flex creates special objects which represent empty space. When, for example, an explosion blows a hole in a rock wall, the Re-flex technology creates an \\"empty space\\" object which is the approximate size and shape of the explosion. The use of a specially designed test level in the beta version shown at E3, and the decision to release it exclusively for the Dreamcast, was chiefly to demonstrate the unlimited possibilities that the Re-Flex geography system was capable of; which was once thought impossible to do on a home console.

Biography  Brenner is a native of New York City. Since his ordination at the New York campus of the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion in 1964, he has been a U.S. Army chaplain stationed in West Germany, senior staff chaplain at the clinical center of The National Institutes of Health(NIH), and served a number of congregations, including Bet Chesed in Maryland. As the first rabbi on the faculty of St. Vincent College and Seminary in Latrobe, PA, he taught Jewish religious thought and philosophy. His first major work, American Jewry and the Rise of Nazism, received the YIVO Jewish Scholarship Prize. His book, The Faith and Doubt of Holocaust Survivors, is the result of nine years of research conducted among survivors in Israel in order to explore the ramifications of the Holocaust upon their own personal belief and practice as Jews. This book was a finalist for the 1981 National Jewish Book Awards. Brenner is also the author of The Jewish Riddle Collection: A Yiddle's Riddles, and the books Jewish, Christian, Chewish, and Eschewish: Interfaith Pathways for the New Millennium an outgrowth of his extensive work with interfaith couples, and his defense of the reality of the Exodus entitled While the Skies were Falling. Inspired by his young cousin, Janis Furmansky, who uses a wheelchair after an automobile accident, Brenner came up with a new sport called Bankshot while living in Israel in 1981. He wanted to develop a non-exclusionary basketball contest that entire families, including those with disabled members, could play. Sports Illustrated featured him in an article called \\"The Rabbi of Roundball; Rabbi Creates a new sport\\". He also serves as foundation president and founder of the National Association for Recreational Equality (NARE) and serves as the commissioner of the National Association of Bankshot Operators (NABO).  Works  *The Faith and the Doubt of Holocaust Survivors The Faith and Doubt of Holocaust Survivors\\" is without question an extraordinary achievement. When it was first published the book was clearly a classic, and now, in its revised and updated version it is even more valuable as a resource for our understanding and awareness of the thinking and feelings of those who went through one of the worst tragedies of human history. The dictionary defines the word ‚Äúclassic‚Äù as a work of enduring excellence, something perfect of its kind; regarded as of first historical significance; having recognized and permanent value. To be classified as a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, a book must be singular, irreplaceable and not possibly replicated. We know and acknowledge immediately that there are none others like it. For a Jewish book to be classified as a classic it must also address ultimate issues profoundly and it must be equal to the task, that is, equal to capturing and disclosing the enormity of the subject it addresses. The Faith and Doubt of Holocaust Survivors is a book that cannot be rewritten principally but not solely because the subjects are no longer with us. The generation studied for their experience of the trauma of the Shoah is no more. Besides as Prof. Alan Zuckerman has written, the book may be ‚Äúthe single most important research study of 20th century Jews and Judaism.‚Äù Brenner has provided us with a rare genuine classic, meeting the above stated criteria. Replication is impossible for a study of Holocaust survivors who were teenagers before the war. Before, during, directly after and 30 years later, like stopping places at critical stages of their life‚Äôs journey, register the timeline of the longitudinal study. - Task, Arnold, Rabbi; book review in The Reform Jewish Quarterly, (Summer 2015) *The Jewish Riddle Collection: A Yiddle's Riddles *American Jewry and the Rise of Nazism *Jewish, Christian, Chewish, and Eschewish: Interfaith Pathways for the New Millennium *While the Skies were Falling: The Exodus and the Cosmos \\"Mind- boggling is my initial response to this magnum opus by Reeve Brenner. As I am one who claims respectable familiarity with Jewish sources, but only a layman's awareness of Catastrophic Uniformitarian theories about the cosmos, I find Reeve Brenner's focused compendium particularly challenging. His work presents as a thoroughly researched advocate for Immanuel Velikovsky's multi- works in advancing Catastrophic theories forcing the reevaluation of critical appraisals of what the biblical record really shows.

Angrense) is a multi- disciplinary sports club, located in the municipality of Angra do Hero√≠smo, on the island of Terceira, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The S.C. Angrense soccer team plays in the Campeonato de Portugal. History The origins of the Sport Club have their origin in the beginning of the 20th century, when its football players first played with a ball that arrived from England, in the fields of Relv√£o, alongside the Bay of Angra near the walls of the Fort of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista. The first teams that developed in Terceira were unorganized, but slowly developed into a formal union of teams, leading to the creation of the Associa√ß√£o de Foot-Ball de Angra do Hero√≠smo on 4 August 1921. At that time the Uni√£o Desportiva dos Empregados do Com√©rcio (Sporting Union of Commercial Workers), one of the oldest football clubs on Terceira, that would form the nucleus of Sport Club Angrense. In the beginning this group only accepted enthusiasts linked with commerce, but later accepted a series of players who had difficulty in being recruited by other teams. The growth in the interest in organized football increased markedly, resulting in the construction of the Campo de Jogos de Angra do Hero√≠smo (Angra do Hero√≠smo Game Field), inaugurated on 24 June 1924. But, due to disagreements on the direction of the club, the Commercial Workers Union was dissolved, resulting in the appearance of several new teams, that included Club Desportivo Angrense (Angrense Sports Club), known locally as Os Caveiras (the skulls), and Sporting Club da Terceira. Union For many of its early years, the Terceira Sporting Club just practised physical education, with its seat in the old Convent of Graca, in Alto das Covas. On 22 November 1929, through the initiative of the members of the Terceira Sporting Club, these clubs merged to form Sport Club Angrense. Officially, the club was organized on 1 December 1929, and approved by the Governor of the Autonomous District of Angra do Hero√≠smo (on 16 January 1942).The only revision to this charter was approved on May 2005, during a general assembly. A letter from the Administrative Council, signed by President Lieutenant Gil Gon√ßalves and dated 2 December 1929, was published in the weekly publication A P√°tria (14 December 1929) to the creation of the new club. Apart from President Gil Gon√ßalves, the administrative council consisted of: Jacinto da C√¢mara Teixeira (Vice- President), Ant√≥nio Mendes Linhares (Tresurer), Armando Magalh√£es de Mendon√ßa (first Secretary), Jos√© Elias do Amaral (second Secretary), Ant√≥nio Lino dos Santos Ramos Moniz (Director) and Jos√© Correia Berbereia (Director). In addition to corresponding publications in O P√°tria, acknowledge the teams training schedule in the city field on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with the season opener dated for 22 December 1929, against the Lusit√¢nia Sport Club. This game, which would be the first of an ongoing rivalry between the two teams, was won by Angrense (4-3), and included the following players: Jos√© C. da Silva Freitas (Jos√© Baptista), Pedro Jos√© Pimentel (Pedro Brasileiro) and M√°rio Pereira de Aguiar; Jos√© Lu√≠s Gon√ßalves (Jos√© das Terras), Eug√©nio Pereira de Aguiar and Ildefonso Borges; Manuel Serpa Bulc√£o, Manuel Pereira, Ant√≥nio Lino dos Santos Moniz, Jo√£o Borges and Jos√© Ant√≥nio √Åvila. The goals were marked by Manuel Pereira, Jo√£o Borges (captain of the team at the time) and Ant√≥nio Lino (who scored twice). The first team was equipped with a red jersey, with black vertical stripes, taking on some of the characteristics of the former Sporting Club of Terceira (red jerseys and white shorts) and Club Desportivo Angrense (all black jerseys). Champions The importance of Angrense within Azorean football was consolidated between the 1930s and 1950s, with a total of eight district championships. By the time Angrense captured its first title, in the district championship of Angra do Hero√≠smo (1931-1932), the team had already adapted its recognizable red shirt, white shorts and red socks, that was comparable to the early Sporting Club of Terceira. At the end of the 1933-1934 season, Angrense won the Azorean championship in Ponta Delgada, against rivals Uni√£o Micaelense and Ang√∫stias da Horta. This championship was never recognized officially, because the Azorean tournament (which began to serve as the regional championship), for the Portuguese Cup, only began in the following season. In the 1936-1937 season, Angrense was the first team from Terceira to capture the Azorean title, on home soil, in the Angra do Hero√≠smo. Game Field. In addition to winning this title, within the same epoch Angrense became a farm team of S.L. Benfica, based on Benfica's annual accounts and report (1936‚Äì37). From here Angrense began to use the same equipment and colors, including the eagle and motto E Pluribus Unum.In 1965, Benfica separated its branches and Angrense became a local delegation of the team. On 1 December 1954, Angrense commemorated its silver anniversary under the presidency of Major Miguel Cristov√£o de Ara√∫jo. Part of these celebrations included an honorary game with Uni√£o Praiense, and solemn ceremony and speech by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederico Lopes J√∫nior, one of the early club players. In May 1958, Angrense brought to Terceira the Senhor Santo Cristo do Milagres Cup, after winning a four-way tournament between Santa Clara, Uni√£o Micaelense and Mar√≠timo sport clubs. It was in the 1960s, that Angrense achieved its highest point, when it won the insular, Azorean and district championships during the 1959-60 seasons. A large crowd was present on 3 May 1960, in the Angra do Hero√≠smo Game Field, to watch the game between Angrense and Mar√≠timo of Madeira, during the quarter finals of the Portuguese Cup. Angrense won this championship over Mar√≠timo 2-1, while the secondary game was decided in a draw. For the first time in regional football history, an Azorean team participated in the Portuguese Cup, against the national champion and benefactor, Benfica. Benfica's first trip to the Azores for a championship, the team arrived on 4 June 1960, to the enthusiasm of local spectators and supporters, and members of the team travelled, not only to Terceira, but to the islands of Faial and S√£o Miguel, where they were met was adulation. In the final, Benfica won 2-0 on 5 June 1960, and later soundly defeated Angrense 10-0 in the return engagement in the Est√°dio da Luz, Lisbon, on 12 June. Two seasons later, after capturing the island title, Angrense once again captured the district title in Angra do Hero√≠smo, during the 1961-62 season.

She has released four cookbooks about preparing food for families, and is the founder of the GOOD+ Foundation (formerly Baby Buggy), a New York City-based charitable organization that provides essential items for families in need throughout New York City. She is married to comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Early life \\"Jessica\\" Nina Sklar was born in Oyster Bay, New York, the middle child of three daughters, and grew up in a middle-class household in Burlington, Vermont. Her mother was a Victims Service Advocate for more than fifty years and an attendance officer at Hunt Middle School, while her father was a computer software engineer.  Career  After graduating from the University of Vermont, Seinfeld worked in public relations for Golden Books Entertainment and Tommy Hilfiger.  Baby Buggy  Seinfeld founded Baby Buggy in 2001 following the birth of her first child. She started with a donation drive, whereby she asked people for their used baby supplies after realizing that her first child's products, no longer of use to her own family, could certainly be used by others. With a motto of \\"Love. Recycled\\", Baby Buggy's goal is to help families in need be able to access the essentials for ensuring their safety and well-being. By providing concrete resources to families through a network of social service professionals, Baby Buggy seeks to alleviate the stress of living in poverty and help in the prevention of crisis. As of May 2013, Baby Buggy has donated over six million items to New York families since the organization was established. Baby Buggy works with a network of over 50 community-based organizations (CBOs) that are carefully selected‚Äîeach applies annually to become a recipient. Some of the organizations that have partnered with Baby Buggy include organizations working with victims of domestic violence such as Safe Horizon and New York Asian Women's Center, now known as Womankind; multi- service sites including Single Stop East Harlem and Lenox Hill Neighborhood House; prenatal and NICU units at hospitals such as Woodhull and NY Presbyterian; immigrant and refugee-serving organizations including the International Rescue Committee; and parenting programs, such as the Nurse- Family Partnership program and the Harlem Children's Zone's Baby College. About $2 Million of Baby Buggy's budget is made up of in-kind product donations from individuals and corporations. Financial support for the organization comes from its board of directors, the Friends of Baby Buggy group, private individuals, corporations and foundations. As of 2008, 88 cents of every dollar received by Baby Buggy went straight to programs. In 2013, Baby Buggy received its fourth Four Star rating from Charity Navigator. The charity is also an Accredited Charity of the Better Business Bureau. In July 2010, Baby Buggy launched a layette collection with Target Corporation, with 10% of sales going to help families in need. The layette line was designed by illustrator and children's book author Maira Kalman. In 2016, Baby Buggy was rebranded as the Good Plus Foundation (also seen as Good+ Foundation). As Baby Buggy, the nonprofit had seen 20 million items donated to families across the United States. Seinfeld shared with \\"Good Morning America\\" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos that the charity had outgrown its name. The Good Plus Foundation pairs goods and services in an incentives program. For example, a parent who opens an education savings account will also receive a stroller.  Cookbooks  Comedian Alexandra Wentworth and Seinfeld at the 2012 premiere of What to Expect When You're ExpectingIn October 2007, Seinfeld released her first cookbook, Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food, which contains strategies and recipes for making healthy food appealing to young children. The book features traditional recipes, such as mac and cheese and spaghetti and meatballs, that get a nutritional boost from vegetable purees. Deceptively Delicious was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, remaining on the list for five months after its release.William Morrow The book also reached No. 1 on Amazon.com and No. 2 on the USA Today bestseller list. Expert Joy Bauer added nutritional advice to the recipes, while Dr. Roxana Mehran and Dr. Mehmet Oz penned the foreword. A portion of the royalties from Deceptively Delicious was donated to Baby Buggy. In October 2010, Seinfeld released her second cookbook, Double Delicious! Good, Simple Food for Busy, Complicated Lives, which shared more healthy twists on traditional recipes, and incorporated vegetable purees, whole grains, and alternatives to processed sugars and flours. Like her first book, Double Delicious! was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.http://www.oprah.com/packages/jessica-seinfeld.html In 2013 she released her third cookbook, The Can't Cook Book, billed as \\"100 recipes for the absolutely terrified!\\" In 2017 she released her fourth cookbook, Food Swings.  Do it Delicious  In October 2010, Seinfeld launched a website for beginner cooks called \\"Do it Delicious.\\" The website teaches at-home viewers how to prepare particular dishes or meals step-by-step, as well as a kitchen guide, store, blog, and community forum where users can submit tips and ask how-to questions. Personal life Jessica and her husband Jerry Seinfeld in New York, April 2010 In June 1998, she married Eric Nederlander, a theatrical producer and the son of theater owner Robert Nederlander. Several months before the wedding, she met Jerry Seinfeld at a Reebok Sports Club. After returning from a honeymoon in Italy with Nederlander, she began dating Seinfeld. Nederlander filed for divorce in October 1998, only four months after marriage. Sklar and Seinfeld became engaged in November 1999, and were married on December 25, 1999. Comedian George Wallace was the best man at the wedding. After much criticism from Nederlander on Sklar's divorce and subsequent marriage, the Seinfelds gave a personal account of their relationship to Vogue in 2004. Jessica Seinfeld is quoted as having said, Jerry Seinfeld has said, \\"If it wasn't for Jess and the kids, I'd really blow my brains out. Jessica saved my life. She gave me something to care about.\\" The Seinfelds have three children, all born in New York City. Daughter Sascha was born November 7, 2000; son Julian Kal on March 1, 2003; and Shepherd Kellen was born on August 22, 2005. Lawsuit and dismissal Seinfeld's first book Deceptively Delicious was published by HarperCollins on January 7, 2008, and contained a series of recipes to hide pureed fruits and vegetables inside children's meals. Following her book's release, another cookbook author, Missy Chase Lapine, sued both Seinfelds, accusing Jessica of copyright and trademark infringement. Lapine had unsuccessfully shopped her own manuscript, The Sneaky Chef, to several publishers, including HarperCollins, before publishing with Running Press.How to Get Junior to Eat His Veggies Turns Out to Be (Too) Common Knowledge The New York Times. In response to the accusations, Seinfeld denied that either author had invented the idea of hiding fruits and vegetables in children's meals, and asserted that \\"countless prior works utilized this very same unprotectable idea\\" in cookbooks dating back to 1971. She claimed, \\"My book came from years of trying to get my own children to eat healthy foods‚Äîmy own trial and error in my own kitchen. The idea of pureeing vegetables has been around for decades.\\" In the same lawsuit, Lapine also accused Jerry Seinfeld of defamation, after he appeared on Late Show with David Letterman on October 29, 2007 and called Lapine \\"angry and hysterical,\\" a \\"wacko,\\" a \\"stalker\\" and a \\"nut job,\\" and suggested that \\"people with three names ... become assassins.\\" In 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed all claims against Jessica Seinfeld, but left open the claim of defamation against her husband, to be tried in New York state court. The federal judge ruled that \\"no reasonable fact finder could conclude\\" that any copying occurred, and that the books were \\"very different\\" and had \\"a completely different feel.\\" Lapine appealed the decision, but the dismissal was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2010. In 2011, the state court dismissed the remaining defamation claim against Jerry Seinfeld.

The fifth in a line of major indoor venues built in Sioux City, it was designed by Knute E. Westerlind in 1938 and finally completed after many delays in 1950. In the building's original form, it was an arena that seated up to 3,500 people. In 2003, the building was replaced by the Tyson Events Center, built around the northeast corner of the Municipal Auditorium. The building was then converted to its current use as a recreation center though much of the exterior was preserved and retained the Auditorium name on the building. History For countless generations, the Native American residents at the confluence of the Big Sioux River with the Missouri River held their ceremonies, performances, and sporting events primarily outdoors, without need of specialized structures. The fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1830 forced them to leave Iowa, and forty years later the new White residents built the first in a series of five major indoor venues for Sioux City: the Academy of Music of 1870, the Peavey Grand Opera House of 1888, the Old Municipal Auditorium of 1909, this one completed in 1950, and Gateway Arena of 2003. The Academy of Music was located between Pierce and Douglas Streets on the southern side of Fourth Street. Designed by local architect H.O. Ball and erected by the firm of Sharp and Beck, it employed cast iron columns, a brick exterior, and terra cotta. The first floor included the city post office and commercial space, with an 800-seat performance space on the second floor. As the city's only large hall, it held high school graduations, theatrical performances, concerts, and speeches, including at least two by Susan B. Anthony speaking on behalf of women's suffrage. The building ended its life as part of the growing Davidson Brothers Department Store, and was demolished in 1910 to make way for a better structure for the store. The Peavey Grand Opera House was built in 1888, and \\"this elegant facility replaced the Academy of Music as the city's cultural center\\". The limitations of the Academy of Music were clear by 1881, but it wasn't until it was combined with the desire for a new chamber of commerce building that it became a viable project. Architects James W. Martin and Oscar Cobb joined forces to design the resulting Romanesque revival building with a mansard roof, located on the northwest corner of Fourth and Jones Streets. A bank and a drug store occupied either side of the theater lobby on the first floor, while the chamber of commerce, local weather bureau, real estate and other offices filled the upper floors. The opera hall itself was in back, and seated over 1300 in lavish style. During its heyday, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"the most famous actress the world has ever known\\", and Edwin Booth, the greatest Hamlet of the 19th Century, each played the Peavey. After 1909 the hall was no longer in demand, and the deteriorating hall was eventually relegated to Hans Esperson's auto repair garage, while the elegant front offices housed the seedy Grand Hotel and Harry Zanfes' Cafe. The whole thing went up in flames on November 3, 1931. The Old Municipal Auditorium of 1909 was built on the southwest corner of Seventh and Douglas Streets, directly across Douglas from the site where construction would begin seven years later on the outstanding Woodbury County Courthouse. Designed by architect George W. Burkhead, this was the first of the buildings dedicated exclusively to the performance hall. Its most distinctive features are the pediment high over the main entrance, above the brick cornice, and prominent keystones over the entrances. It was undistinguished architecturally; soon after its construction, The Western Architect characterized it as \\"an ugly, barn-like structure dignified by the name of 'Auditorium'.\\" It was the home of television station KCAU-TV (original call letters KVTV) from 1955 until early 2017. The cornerstone at the southeast shows the year completed rather than begun.The Old Municipal Auditorium of 1909 was no longer meeting the needs of Sioux City by the 1930s, but the Sioux City Auditorium was a long time in coming. Originally designed by architect Knute E. Westerlind in 1938, it took nearly 12 years to complete. In the election of 1938, city voters approved a $590,000 bond referendum, but the city postponed action in an ultimately fruitless bid to secure federal assistance. Finally issuing the bonds in April 1941, the basement was dug and pilings driven before World War II shortages caused the project to grind to a halt in 1943. Work resumed in 1947, but only after the electorate approved an additional $975,000 bond referendum. Post-war inflation, cost over-runs, poor planning, and other problems resulted in the need for a third bond referendum, this time for over $1.4 million on April 26, 1949. Ultimately costing more than $2.7 million, the new facility was dedicated on September 9, 1950. For over 50 years, the auditorium routinely hosted graduations, concerts, and sporting events, including the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra and (since 1972) the Sioux City Musketeers ice hockey team. Until 1982 it served as the home arena for the Briar Cliff College Chargers. Among those appearing on its stage were Elvis Presley, Robert Plant, Richard M. Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Van Cliburn. In 2001, the Sioux City Symphony moved to the newly restored Orpheum Theater, and in 2003 the venue was replaced for large concerts and sporting events by Gateway Arena. The new Events Center was built around to the northwest corner of the Municipal Auditorium, with doors added to connect the buildings. Part of the former Municipal Auditorium is used by the Events Center for storage, and the dressing rooms are still being used for Events Center acts. A historical preservation group wanted to maintain the history of the arena and decided to use it for recreation, naming it the Long Lines Family Recreation Center, being sponsored by Long Lines. Among other attractions, the center offers volleyball and basketball courts, a batting cage, and a climbing wall; and hosts weddings, receptions, and other events. Architecture The Auditorium's smooth brick walls, rounded corners, and deeply incised openings typify the Moderne style.Terra cotta panel on the Auditorium's south exterior, east of the main entranceKnute E. Westerlind's design is fundamentally PWA Moderne, a style in vogue in the 1930s when it was originally designed. In keeping with Moderne style, Westerlind employed smooth brick walls, rounded corners, glass block windows, patterns of horizontal lines, and openings that appear \\"cut into the building\\". However, Westerlind, a protege of prominent Prairie School architect William L. Steele, brought a Beaux-Arts approach to determining its massing, symmetry, proportions, and details. In this divergence of style with approach, he was in keeping with his mentor, since Steele often brought a Beaux-Arts sensibility to his fundamentally Prairie School compositions. The building is rich in details, including relief sculptures of stylized Native Americans on the northern exterior, and a number of terra cotta panels on the southern exterior, each depicting a person involved in a sporting or musical activity. There are inscriptions above the entrances: the one on the west reads \\"There is No Greater Conquest Than That of Self\\", while the one on the east reads \\"Art at Its Highest and Nature at Its Truest are One\\".

She was considered a capable instructor and flew everything except flying boats. Early life Hughes was born in West Ham, Essex in 1918. Her mother was Lily Amelia Lekeup and her father Arthur Edward Hughes manufactured braids. She and her brother started flying training when she was fifteen and their parents paid the East Anglian Aero Club ¬£2/10s and hour. At that time you could fly a plane at any age and so by 17 had she become the youngest qualified female pilot in Britain. Air Transport Auxiliary As an experienced aviator, Hughes was one of the first eight female pilots accepted into the Air Transport Auxiliary on 1 January 1940 and Hughes was the youngest female pilot to join the service. Hughes initially flew Tiger Moths from Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire and soon Hughes had more than 600 hours' experience ferrying aircraft around the country. Though small in stature, she ferried all types of aircraft including heavy four-engined bombers such as the Short Stirling. She became both a senior pilot and the only woman qualified to instruct on all types of military aircraft then in service. Post war First 8 women pilots in front of their De Havilland Tiger Moths (right to left): Pauline Gower (Commandant), Margaret Cunnison (obscured), Winifred Crossley, Hon.Margaret Fairweather, Mona Friedlander, Joan Hughes, G Patterson and Rosemary Rees. Hughes continued to fly after the war, using her talents as an instructor. She was featured in \\"The Eagle Special Investigator Meets Joan Mills in 'Special Investigator Flies Solo'\\" in the 1953 book Eagle Special Investigator.Macdonald Hastings, Eagle Special Investigator by Macdonald Hastings, page 61, published by Michael Joseph. In the 1960s, Hughes served as a flying instructor with the Airways Aero Association, first at White Waltham Airfield, and then at Booker Airfield. In early 1964, due to her low weight and considerable experience, Hughes was recruited for testing a near-replica of the 1909 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle monoplane, ultimately flying it for the shooting of the 1965 film Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. She also flew replica World War I aircraft for the film The Blue Max (1966) and a Tiger Moth bi-plane for the live-action flying shots in Thunderbird 6 (1968). In the latter film she ended up in court as it was alleged that she had flown under a motorway bridge in a dangerous manner. The case was abandoned after they heard that she had flown, rather than taxied under, the bridge because this was the safest choice. During the 20 June 1966 episode of To Tell The Truth television panel show, Hughes appeared as herself; two of the four panelists correctly picked her as the contestant. She retired at Booker Airfield in 1985, after spending ober 10,000 hours instructing other pilots making up 11,800 flight hours in her logbook. Honours Hughes was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1946 for her war work. A bus company in Hatfield named its eight buses after the \\"first eight\\" of the Tiger Moth pilots in the ATA, including Hughes. In 2008, the fifteen surviving women members of the ATA (and 100 surviving male pilots) were given a special award by the Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

The College offers undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of public policy, international studies, and political management. These include the Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management (BPAPM),the Bachelor of Global and International Studies (BGInS), the Master of Political Management (MPM), and the MA in Migration and Diaspora Studies (MDS). The College was established in 1999 and is named for the late Arthur Kroeger, a senior Canadian public servant and former Chancellor of Carleton University.  History  Prior to the formation of the Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs, Carleton University had an established reputation for studies in public policy and administration. As the Canadian government became increasingly focused on reintegrating veterans into civilian life toward the end of World War II, a need arose to meet the needs of an expanding federal public service. The university, then called Carleton College, introduced a Bachelor of Public Administration (B.P.A.) degree under the Institute of Public Administration in 1944, becoming the first category of undergraduate degree issued by the university. Initial coursework covered a broad spectrum of disciplines, including public finance, statistics, political science, and organizational management. In 1999, Carleton created the new Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management (B.P.A.P.M.) The degree was housed in the new Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs. The program was conceived to prepare students for leadership roles at the nexus of the private, public, and non-profit sectors, providing students with strong foundations in the theory and application of public policy, with the College serving as its intellectual home. A fundraising steering committee, led by prominent Toronto businessman George Anderson, embarked on an ambitious campaign to raise $1.5 million to support the College‚Äôs activities, including an endowment fund, visiting fellowships, and leadership conferences to enhance student experience Computer lab at the Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs, 2018The College's namesake, Arthur Kroeger, was a reputed public servant who held a number of senior positions within the Canadian public service prior to his appointment as Chancellor of Carleton University in 1993. The College formally opened on October 2, 1999 with a reception attended by then-leading figures in Canadian public affairs, including former NDP leader Ed Broadbent, journalist Trina McQueen, and former Clerk of the Privy Council Gordon Robertson. During its first year, the B.P.A.P.M. program received nearly two hundred applications for its first class, with 67 students admitted to the program that year The program produced its first cohort of graduates in 2003. From 1999 to 2012, the Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management was the sole program housed in the Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs, until a $15 million donation from petroleum magnate Clayton Riddell helped establish a Master in Political Management program, a graduate degree focusing on strategic planning and communications related to managing political campaigns and offices. In 2015, the College received an additional undergraduate program, the Bachelor of Global and International Studies (BGInS) program, focusing predominantly on academic disciplines related to international affairs, ranging from political science, economics, anthropology, and sociology. Unlike the other two programs associated with Arthur Kroeger College, the Bachelor of Global and International Studies received its own office and administrative staff separate from Arthur Kroeger College housed in Richcraft Hall.  College  Since its inception in 1999, Arthur Kroeger College has had a dedicated space on the first floor of the Loeb Building housing the College's administrative offices and other student spaces. The College is used largely by students in the Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management and Master of Political Management program. The College contains a reception area for visitors, as well as the private offices of the Director and other administrative staff. Copies of leading news magazines, periodicals, and academic journals are available for students to peruse in this area. The College contains a computer lab reserved for use by students in the Public Affairs and Policy Management program, containing several computer stations and a complimentary printer. The computer lab is accessible through a secured exterior door outside of business hours. The College is also home to the Donald J. Carty Boardroom, which hosts meetings of the College administration and seminars for Public Affairs and Policy Management courses.

For much of the College's existence, the BPAPM has been its flagship program. Compared to similar programs at Carleton, the program has higher admission requirements and limited enrollment, with typical first year cohorts not exceeding 120 students.  Academics  Students completing a Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management are required to complete core courses throughout their undergraduate career. Course content covers topics such as political and economic theory, public policy analysis, program evaluation, research methods, and organizational theory. Depending on a student‚Äôs specialization, other coursework encompasses fields such as law, political science, business, economics, sociology, and political science. Students must complete courses in French language reflecting an intermediate proficiency in the language by their graduation. In their fourth year, students must complete a semester-long (0.5 credit) Capstone Seminar, in addition to an Honours Research Essay (HRE) in order to graduate. Students typically conduct research in a field related to their specialization to complete their HRE.  Areas of specialization  Former specializations Prior to September 2016, the Public Affairs and Policy Management offered seven specializations to students:. Students admitted prior to the 2016-17 academic year retain these specializations throughout their courses and during graduation. *Communication and Information Technology Policy *Development Studies *Human Rights *International Studies *Public Policy and Administration *Social Policy *Strategic Public Opinion & Policy Analysis Current specializations Beginning in the 2016-17 academic year, students entering the Public Affairs and Policy Management program are required to choose a specialization, in addition to a narrower Policy Stream within their specified field of study. This change was prompted by a growing desire among students for a more personalized learning experience better suited toward their career needs and research interests within the program. *Communication and Policy Studies **Communication Technologies Regulation **Strategic Public Opinion *Development Policy Studies **Rights and Human Development **Global Economic Relations *International Policy Studies **International Relations & Conflict **Security and Intelligence *Public Policy & Administration **Economic Policy **Social Policy **Environmental & Sustainable Energy Policy  Experiential learning  Students can complete a co-op designation as a part of their degree. This offers students the ability to gain valuable experience working directly in public policy and administration. Carleton's location in Ottawa ideal for allowing students to access opportunities within the Government of Canada, non-profit organizations, research firms, and consulting groups. Many students, following the completion of their summer terms, are occasionally retained for part-time work during study terms. To graduate with co-op designation, it requires three four-month work terms, with the option for a fourth term. With the work-study schedule for B.PAPM, graduating with the co-op designation can take an additional 1-3 semesters to complete the program, dependent on course requirements and the number of work terms.  Student experience and alumni  The Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management is consistently regarded as one of Carleton's top undergraduate programs, alongside Journalism, Architecture, Global and International Studies, and International Business. Students in the program continue to be recognized for their academic merit. Since 2012, six PAPM students have been awarded the prestigious Killam Undergraduate Fellowship by Fulbright Canada for academic exchange in the United States. PAPM students are represented by a student government, the Arthur Kroeger College Educational Students‚Äô Society (AKCESS). Established in 2003, it is composed of a President, six Vice Presidents, and Year Representatives for the freshman and sophomore cohorts. The organization hosts social events, networking opportunities, and other initiatives to promote community within the program. The Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management has produced many successful alumni in the fields of law, public administration, and politics, including two sitting Members of Parliament.  Bachelor of Global and International Studies  The Bachelor of Global and International Studies (BGInS) is a specialized, interdisciplinary four-year program, offering both general and honours degree options. The program was conceptualized and developed by former Program Director Chris Brown. On top of selecting one of 17 different streams, students are required to complete a variety of core courses in global history and ethnography to gain a nuanced understanding of global and international processes from a multidisciplinary perspective. The BGInS degree also has a mandatory second-language requirement Academics Although a relatively new degree program offered through the College, having received its first cohort of students in the 2015-16 academic year, the program has attracted high rates of applications. In its inaugural year, the program saw 505 applications. Along with the core faculty the degree is taught by over 120 affiliated faculty members from 19 different academic units across the university (such as law, politics, and history) to provide larger breadth of knowledge for students to draw upon, and they often also supervise Honours Research Essays that students complete in their fourth year of study. International Experience Requirement Students completing an honours Bachelor of Global and International Studies must complete an International Experience Requirement. This component of the degree offers students immersive learning in diverse global settings, exposing them to cross-cultural perspectives across different academic disciplines. Students have access to dedicated staff to assist them with identifying and applying for international opportunities relevant to their field of study. Students are able to choose one of six pathways to complete this requirement: *International Exchange *Carleton Course Taught Abroad *Global and International Group Project *Experiential Learning Abroad *Letter of Permission *International Placement  Areas of specialization  The BGInS degree is multidisciplinary, composed of 18 specializations (called 'streams' in the general degree) that range from regional to thematic. They are listed below:  Thematic specializations and streams  * French and Francophone Studies * Global and Transnational History * Global Development * Global Genders and Sexualities * Global Inequalities and Social Change * Global Law and Social Justice * Global Literatures * Global Media and Communication * Global Politics * Global Religions: Identity and Community * Globalization and the Environment * Globalization, Culture, Power * International Economic Policy * Migration and Diaspora Studies * Teaching English in Global Contexts  Regional specializations and streams  * Africa and Globalization * Europe and Russia in the World * Latin American and Caribbean Studies  Graduate programs   Master of Political Management  The Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management, otherwise known as the Master of Political Management (MPM) program, is a one-year graduate program focusing on political management, preparing students for leadership roles in campaigns, political parties, political offices, and non-governmental organizations. The program is the first of its kind to be offered in Canada. Students receive experiential learning through a ten-week practicum in political offices, consulting firms, and non-governmental organizations within the National Capital Region. The program offers several core courses in Institutions and Governance, Strategic Communications, and Political Management. Other courses include communications, management, and political marketing. The program was made possible by a $15 million donation from Clayton Riddell, after whom the program is named. The implications of this donation was later criticized for allowing donor influence over the budget, hiring, and curriculum. The agreement was later rewritten to clarify that the five-person steering committee does not have the power to \\"approve\\" hiring and curriculum decisions and instead only provides advice.  MA in Migration and Diaspora Studies  The MA in Migration and Diaspora Studies is a two-year graduate program in migration studies, examining the social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions of international migration and diaspora communities globally. The program allows studies to complete the program through coursework, a research essay, or thesis.

Their capital, Noviomagus Nemeton (or Civitas Nemetum), was close to the site of medieval Speyer.Civitas Nemetum was destroyed in the 5th century, and Villa Spira was a Frankish settlement established in the 7th century outside the confines of the ancient settlement. Both are within the confines of the modern city of Speyer. Their area of settlement was the contact zone between Celtic (Gaulish) and Germanic peoples. According to Tacitus, the Nemetes were \\"unquestionably Germanic\\".Tacitus. Germania 28. The name of the tribe, however, is Celtic as the name of its main town Noviomagus meaning noviios 'new' and magos 'plain', 'market' (cf. Welsh maes 'field', Old Irish mag 'plain'), as are those of several gods worshipped in their territory, including Nemetona, who is thought to have been their eponymous deity.John T. Koch (2006).

Their territory on the left bank of the Rhine had belonged to the Mediomatrici during the time of Caesar and Strabo, but the Nemetes must have crossed the river and settled there sometime afterward.George Long. \\"Mediomatrici\\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. Under the Roman administrative organization of Gaul, the Nemetes constituted a civitas of the province of Upper Germany with a relatively small territory extending from the Rhine into the Palatinate Forest and an administrative centre at Speyer. Ptolemy mentions Neomagus (i.e. Noviomagus) and Rufiniana as the towns of the Nemetes;Claudius Ptolemaeus. Geographia, II:8. if the latter is to be identified with Rouffach, Ptolemy is mistaken in attributing it to the Nemetes, for Rouffach is far to the south in Rauracan territory.George Long. \\"Rufiniana\\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.In fact, the mistake comes from more modern historians, because Rufiniana cannot be the former name of Rouffach. It is impossible for three reasons : 1 - The ancient forms of this place-name are known as Rubiaco en 662, Rubac 912, Rubiacum 12th. 2 - The end of Rufiniana supposes two suffixes -ini(us?)-ana and Rubiaco has only one -aco. 3 - The first element Ruf- cannot change to [b] into Latin Rub-. On the contrary, the shift from [b] to [p] and finally to [f] (Rubac > *Rupach > Rouffach) is the typical result of the High German consonant shift, that took place a long time after Ptolemy's death. It may also be supposed that Saletio (Seltz) belonged to the Nemetes, as in modern times it belonged to the diocese of Speyer; Saletio would have been near the northern limits of the Triboci, whose civitas later became the diocese of Strasbourg.George Long. \\"Triboci\\", from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.

He works in varied media ‚Äì video, installation, drawing, sculpture, and painting ‚Äì with no uniting stylistic tendency, though the Saatchi Gallery finds a uniting theme of \\"a sentiment of excess, corruption, and aggression reflective of cultural anxiety\\".Liu Wei, Saatchi Gallery Conceptualism, satire, and humor are the hallmarks of his works. His works include the Super Structure series of model cityscapes constructed from dog chews; the Purple Air oil paintings of stylised skyscraper cityscapes; the Landscape Series of landscapes made from photographic composites of human buttocks; and Indigestion II, a two- metre model turd. He has shown work in exhibitions including 21: World Wide Video Festival in Amsterdam, Cinema du Reel at the Pompidou Centre in France, Over One Billion Served at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, and Between Past and Future at the International Center for Photography in New York City. His dog chew structures were in 2010 once again shown during the exhibition Dreamlands at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Early career Liu graduated from China Academy of Art in Hangzhou in 1996.Xiaoyan, Guo. Breaking Forecast: 8 Key Figures of China's New Generation Artists. \\"LIU Wei.\\" Hong Kong: Timezone 8, 2010. He stated that he \\"really began doing art after [he] graduated in 1996.\\" Between 1996 and 1998, he experienced a post-graduate period of transition in which he was producing idealistic oil paintings. In 1998 and 1999, he also began producing installation works as well as video projects. The majority of these video projects were related to the human body.He described these works as impulsive and intuitive; works of a still young and impulsive artist. After graduation, he returned to Beijing, where he turned from painting to experiments in other types of media, such as videography. He participated in several DIY exhibitions while supporting himself as an editor at Beijing Youth Daily. In 1999, he was involved with a group of subversive artists known as the ‚ÄúPost-Sense Sensibility‚Äù group and participated in an exhibit known as ‚ÄúPost-Sense, Sensibility, Alienated Bodies, and Delusion.‚Äù Then in 2003, he was invited by Hou Hanru to participate in the Fifth Shenzhen International Public Art Exhibition, which was to be called ‚ÄúThe Fifth System: Public Art in the Age of Post-planning.‚Äù Before, Liu Wei had only worked collaboratively with other student artists. This was his first opportunity to create a solo project with an internationally known curator. At the exhibition, he initially meant to procure and transport an airplane boarding bridge to the exhibition site. However, the endeavor was too expensive and too ambitious and never came to pass. This was his first encounter with ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and its ability to impede on his work. He has cited the mishap as a turning point in his artistic career towards a more pragmatic approach. By 2006, Liu Wei began producing the kinds of works that would characterize his art for the next decade: art concerned with objects of daily life and the systems that govern everyday existence. The \\"Post-Sense Sensibility\\" group Liu began his career as a member of the subversive movement known as Post-Sense Sensibility. Art trends that had been popular in the early 1990s, such as Political Pop and Cynical Realism, seemed outdated and ineffective to many of the younger generation artists. Later in the 1990s, new art forms such as installation, performance art, video art, and conceptual photography were widely embraced and were used to demonstrate Conceptual art that came to dominate contemporary Chinese art. The 1999 show ‚ÄúPost-sense, Sensibility, Alien Bodies and Delusion‚Äù in Shaoyaoju, Beijing, was one that included artists from all over China, notorious for visceral sculptures of human and animal corpses, ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù cadavers juxtaposed with stillborn fetus, severed human arms hanging from meat hooks, and the sounds of a goose, starving to death with its feet glued to the floor. The purpose of the exhibition was to create art that wouldn't be collected by Western audiences, which reveals the extent of resentment against Western powers. The young generation of artists accused foreign collectors of ‚Äúplotting to control Chinese art.‚Äù The Post-Sense Sensibility artists had a shared distaste for the political idealism and rationality of their predecessors. They embraced irrationality, improvisation, intuition, and aimed create extreme experiences. Their shows were held in makeshift venues between 1999 and 2003, and in an effort to have spontaneous context-specific responses, their exhibitions were premised on self-imposed rules that each artist reacted to individually at the exhibition site. Since China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the artists have become more tolerant of Western collectors.‚Äù Liu Wei‚Äôs contribution to the 1999 exhibition was a multichannel video called Hard to Restrain. In the video, naked human figures scurry around ‚Äúlike insects under a spotlight\\". Themes and motifs in art The city A particular constellation of ideas have been circulating within Liu Wei's artwork since 2006. First, Liu has used urban architecture and city landscapes in many of his works, such as Love it! Bite it! or Purple Air, and Outcast. His works present ideas of corruption, alienation, or the immense verticality of a megalopolis‚Äôs infrastructure. About the influence of the city on his art, Liu Wei has said, ‚ÄúCities are reality; all of China is a city under construction, and of course this influences me.‚Äù He also has acknowledged that the reality of the city is powerful and that we ‚Äúfeel numbed most of the time.‚Äù Liu Wei's city is ahistorical. It shows mindless material changing, decay, demolition, and construction. Thus, people are subjected to a constantly changing environment and an overwhelmingly perpetual present. In Liu Wei's city, a person can no longer organize his or her experiences based on a historical narrative. One can only live in the chaotic present. The everyday Liu Wei has produced artworks consisting of everyday ‚Äúreadymade‚Äù materials. Art series such as Anti-Matter (2006) and As Long as I See It (2006) are composed of household objects like washing machines, exhaust fans, and televisions, many of which have been altered, cut out, or ‚Äúblown apart‚Äù by some unspeakable force. These works speak to the mass production and consumerism of modern society, using objects that represent the luxury of contemporary capitalist society. His use of everyday household objects and ‚Äúreadymades‚Äù also suggests a reinvestment in materials. The works demand that, even as new technologies and machines produce new and more ephemeral types of knowledge, humans acknowledge the forms of the everyday objects. Artistic process At Liu Wei's studio in Beijing, little of the artwork is performed by the artist. In 2006, Liu began hiring nearby villagers to assist with the artworks and the number of workers in his studio has continued multiplying. All of his artworks are now produced by teams of assistants and fabricators. Even Liu's representational paintings are digitally generated by the artist and then transferred to a canvas, where they are filled in by studio workers. However, despite Liu Wei's studio work, he has chosen to stop short of mechanizing his artwork, apparently preferring the slight imperfections that come from human hands. He instructs his assistants step by step, and as the assistant performs the instruction, Liu Wei watches and determines the next instruction accordingly; allowing for some improvisation to enter into the work. In sculpture, Liu Wei asserts even less control, which are put together in sections by workers who follow short verbal instructions. His artworks and installations are produced through a process of tinkering as workers add and manipulate the forms in a theatrical experience. He often revisits sculptures and installations, making significant alterations later on. His artworks are constantly in flux, morphing and changing, like any other form of matter. Artistic style In an interview from 2010, Liu Wei was asked, \\"How would you define your work?\\" to which he replied, \\"I couldn't. There's no way to define it.\\" Rather than beginning with a material or a technique, Liu Wei brings his artistic endeavors with ideas and then considers how best to express them. When he becomes comfortable and \\"fluent\\" with a particular type of work and no longer finds any obstacles or problems within that material type and the style it achieves, he changes his materials and styles. Yet Liu Wei readily admits that there is no way to completely \\"kill\\" the idea of style. \\"Actually, there is always still something beneath,\\" he has said, \\"But I could never use some surface things ‚Äì for example, the way lots of artists use a representative form, almost like a symbol or emblem ‚Äì as a way to define my work, or to prove that I had a style of position.\\" Liu Wei suggested that, much like physics, \\"when a structure is at rest, it no longer has any energy, but when the structure is broken, and its parts begin to move around again, it is filled with energy, power, and vitality.\\" It is through continually moving from one style and material to another that Liu Wei perceives his artwork as maintaining interest. Selected artworks Looks Like a Landscape (2004) Digital B/W Photograph 304.8 x 121.9 cm Looks Like a Landscape is a black and white photograph of upturned male buttocks meant to resemble a Chinese mountain landscape.http://www.artnews.com/2014/02/26/liu-wei-chinas- trickster-mixer-upper-artist/ The photograph was entered and accepted in the Shanghai Biennale after organizers of the exhibition requested he make adjustments to his original submission idea, a train car on a rotating turntable.http://www.lehmannmaupin.com/artists/liu-wei/press/1416#9 Rather than accommodate the wishes of the organizers, Wei submitted Looks Like a Landscape. In his description of the work Liu Wei has said \\"I was really angry, really angry, so I decided to show them an ass.\\" Despite the subject matter, the organizers of the Shanghai Biennale were pleased with the traditional Chinese tone of the work and accepted it into the exhibition. After the Biennale, Liu Wei became a known figure in the world of contemporary Chinese art. In an interview with Barbara Pollack, Wei attributes his initial career success to Looks Like a Landscape. In the interview Wei said \\"This photograph changed my life and made it possible for me to live off my work\\". Indigestion II (2004) Mixed Media 83 x 214 x 89 cm Indigestion is meters-high pile of excrement made of tar, one of the petrochemical industry's residual products. In his description of the work, Liu Wei has said \\"The idea behind the work originates from a picture of a giant that has gobbled up everything that crossed his path and who has excreted it all again just before the visitor passes by. If you take a good look at the excrement, it turns out that not everything he so greedily swallowed was digestible. The indigestible leftovers compose a miniature war scene.\\" On closer inspection, one can see that the indigestible \\"kernels\\" of the excrement are actually hundreds of toy soldiers, airplanes, and instruments of war. A comic overstatement, Liu's enormous pile of excrement is a statement of rejection. Typically, a gigantic pile of excrement might serve as a monument of people who are eating well. Yet the war technology and instruments suggest that society is not properly digesting the new technology that has created. Humans think that problems can be solved quickly, through faster and more innovative technology. But in reality, fast \\"digestion\\" only creates more problems and misunderstandings; more indigestion. The work most certainly concerns itself with themes of consumerism, consumption, technology. There also exists a connection between this work and the current global conflict over energy resources. Love it! Bite it! (2006) Edible Dog Chews Dimensions variable Love it! Bite it! is an urban city scene of miniature buildings composed from pieces of dried gut, the type sold in pet shops for dogs to chew on. At the time it was revealed to the public, Liu Wei was surprised by the reaction. The viewers were meant to notice immediately that these buildings were parliament buildings; symbols of power. Instead, they focused on the aesthetic \\"beauty\\" of the buildings, even though Liu Wei had deliberately had his studio produce the tiny buildings in a \\"slipshod\\" way. Liu intended the artwork to show the connection between the material used to construct the buildings and power itself. The comparison he was hoping his audience would make has to do with the human will to power being like a dog to a bone; an animal-like reaction, commenting on the inevitable corruption of power figures.

At the age of 10, Gurland entered the rabbinical school of Wilna, from which he graduated as rabbi in 1860. He then went to St. Petersburg, and was admitted to attend the lectures of the philological faculty, devoting himself to the study of Semitic languages under the direction of Daniel Chwolson. During his stay at the university Gurland translated the fables of Lokman into Russian and published a dissertation on the influence of Arabian philosophy on Moses Maimonides, a subject proposed by the faculty. For his treatment of this, Gurland received a gold medal. In 1864, on obtaining his first degree (\\"candidatus\\") from the university, Gurland devoted three years to the study of the Firkovich collection of Karaite manuscripts in the Russian Imperial Library. The result of this study was the publication, in Russian, of a work on the life of Mordecai Comtino and his contemporaries. For this, Gurland was awarded the degree of \\"magister\\". Gurland was then charged with the cataloging of the Hebrew books of the Imperial Library. In 1869 he went to Yekaterinoslav, where he was appointed examining magistrate in one of the precincts. In 1873 Gurland was appointed inspector of the normal colleges for teachers at Jitomir, a position which he held for seven years. The government conferred upon him two orders and the title of \\"college councilor\\". In 1880, as a consequence of illness, Gurland went to Germany, where he sojourned for three years. On his return, he settled at Odessa, and founded there a classic and scientific college of eight classes, with a curriculum including Jewish history and Hebrew literature. In 1888 Gurland was elected government rabbi of Odessa. He died there on March 14, 1890. Works Gurland was the author of the following works: * O Vliyanii Filosofii Musulmanskoi Religii na Filosofiyu Religii Moiseya Maimonida, St. Petersburg, 1863. * Ma'amar ha-Tammuz, Chwolson's explanation of the term \\"Tammuz\\" as it is used by the prophet Ezekiel, translated from German into Hebrew, Lyck, 1864. * Ginze Yisrael be- Sankt Petersburg, on the Karaite manuscripts of the Imperial Library of St. Petersburg.

It drains the blood collected in the sinuses of the pulp. Details The blood is collected from the interstices of the tissue by the rootlets of the veins, which begin much in the same way as the arteries end. The connective-tissue corpuscles of the pulp arrange themselves in rows, in such a way as to form an elongated space or sinus. They become elongated and spindle-shaped, and overlap each other at their extremities, and thus form a sort of endothelial lining of the path or sinus, which is the radicle of a vein. On the outer surfaces of these cells are seen delicate transverse lines or markings, which are due to minute elastic fibrill√¶ arranged in a circular manner around the sinus. Thus the channel obtains an external investment, and gradually becomes converted into a small vein, which after a short course acquires a coat of ordinary connective tissue, lined by a layer of flattened epithelial cells which are continuous with the supporting cells of the pulp. The smaller veins unite to form larger ones; these do not accompany the arteries, but soon enter the trabecular sheaths of the capsule, and by their junction form six or more branches, which emerge from the hilum, and, uniting, constitute the lienal vein, the largest radicle of the portal vein.

He was born into a wealthy family with a high social status. In the 1990s, there was a cultural movementL√º, Peng. \\"21-New Art and Artists.\\" A History of Art in 20th-Century China. Milano: Charta, 2010. ]}} in China referred to as Cynical Realism of which Fang Lijun was a member. Living in China during this critical time shaped his worldview in terms of his views on art, human values and morality. Biography Fang Lijun attended Children Cultural Place school. During his time at school, he met Li Xianting (who would later be a famous critic) and was introduced to watercolors, oil paints and ink. Fang Lijun decided to leave high school to pursue his artistic dream. He made a decision to go to Hebei Light Industry Technology school to study ceramics for three years. However, Fang Lijun did not want to stop his studies there. Instead of having an intellectual job in the ceramics department, he prepared himself to take the entrance exam to enroll at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. He was fascinated by the medium of oil painting and chose it for his final graduation project. At the beginning of 1992, Fang Lijun moved to Yuanmingyuan village in north-west Beijing. Due to the economy and other difficult cultural issues, painters wanted to create a utopia where they could freely paint and express themselves. That was when Yuanmingyuan village drew artists' attention. At the time, painters like Fang Lijun had to face many obstacles and challenges, particular financial issues. In order to be able to paint, they needed to have funds to buy materials. However, there was no certainty that they would receive any funding, so it was extremely difficult for painters to be able to follow what they love. Fang Lijun and other artists like him had to paint for a living due to the economic pressure. Style Fang Lijun made a large number of works featuring the subject \\"bald heads\\". Under the influence of his family and friends, his art expresses the freedom, the integrity in two different settings: traditional and modern era, and the will of making a change. He explained in an interview that he wished to send a message about the lives of painters through bald-head figures. The bald headed traditional Chinese men are viewed as dumb or stupid. Through these figures, he is sending a message about morality and how people define what is normal based on physical appearance, rather than internal moral character. Fang Lijun values the individual stories of each person. He is asking the society to look at painters as normal people, as people who are making a change, rather than as eccentric outcasts. In his paintings, he also uses elements of water and flower a lot. Water plays a big role in Fang Lijun's paintings. In an interview, he explained that water is helping him convey a message about his feeling and his voice about the truth and what is going in Chinese society. His famous work with water is a man being drowned in water. Part of the reason for this painting relates to his childhood experience when he was almost drowned. The second and most important part in relation to this painting is that he is expressing his feelings about the Chinese society. When the man is drowning in the water, it represents painters like Fang Lijun. He feels like he does not have a voice, that he is powerless in this societal structure and that he cannot even make his own decision or speak the truth. Also, his hope is to freely go and move in the water metaphorically. He is hoping to be able to speak for himself, for other artists and to inspire everyone. He is one of the artists who is standing in the middle line between traditional and modern practice. For example, he still follows the process of the carving of wood with the negative image, coats it with ink and then impresses the image on the paper. Because art projects require different color immersion, Fang uses different plates and a set order of printing on different adjoined scrolls. Each scroll represents one individual against the mass which leads to \\"personal probity\\" in facing adversity. Cynical Realism The earliest exhibition about the Cynical Realism was by Fang Lijun and Liu Wei. \\"Wanshi\\"-Cynical Realism'. The figures in Cynical Realism's paintings were cynical, distorted and accidental. In each of these painting, there is a sense of \\"self - mockery and ridiculous snippets of the surrounding circumstances\\". Different metaphysical questions and searches were discarded by this Cynical Realism. Fang Lijun said: \\"The bastard can be duped a hundred times but he still falls for the same old trick. We'd rather be called losers , bores, basket cases, scoundrels, or airheads, than ever be cheated again\\". Fang Lijun is famous with his \\"illustrative style and bald-headed\\" figures.Lu, Peng, and Bruce G. Doar. \\"11-The Reborn Modern.\\" A Pocket History of 20th- century Chinese Art. Milano: Charta, 2010. 482-85. Print. In these paintings, bald headed young men are in different motions: yawning, smiling, swimming, etc. Some of the figures are described as confusion or considered \\"dumbfounded by modern society\\". His figures represent the loss in direction of youths in China after 1989. Further more, some critics view these figures as inward looking monks which challenge the idea of orthodoxy. He has repeated painting stereotypical bald headed Chinese men with a \\"stupid\\" smiles. There was a shift in his painting before the 1990s and after the 1990s. Before, the relationship between the figures was easy to predict. The background was clearer with different details to help the \\"picture-reader\\" understand the paintings. However, after the 1990s, there was a big shift in the way he portrayed these figures. The relationship is hard to interpret when there usually was a big figure in the front and other small figures in the back. The background was not the main focus of the painting, but it still played a role. This shift leads to a new way of interpreting painting and allows everybody to read and challenge the idea of \\"representation\\" . For some people this shift is considered a self-mockery and dealt with at a distance. 1991.6.1. painting It is a woodblock print which consists of five fabric scrolls (490.9 cm x 606.2 cm in total approximately) . This painting is a composition of a bald headed crowd with sky and clouds in a gray scale. The most important detail in this picture is the large head with an anonymous finger pointing to the sky. This figure is turning so only his left face is shown. He is looking at his finger with a very distinct smirk on his face . His right side is frozen and only some upper teeth are shown. Within a crowd, there are all bald heads facing upward to look to the sky or where the finger is pointing. Some of them have strong emotion by the facial expressions, some are reaching their hands and some look confused. The crowd is painted in a much denser level. This painting reveals confusion and lost. The crowd does not know where to go and where to look. The gray scale of this painting reflects the uncertainty as well as the strong emotion of people during this era. There is a sense of loss in direction which represents the youths and artists in China who are uncertain about the future. Fang Lijan painted the crowd with non distinctive figures to reveal his feeling during that time. The definitions of self- identity and nation-identity are lost. The figures' faces are distorted from suffering through searching for something that is nowhere to be found. Some other critics view the large figure as a Christ-like image because Fang Lijun is influenced by Western culture and style Other paintings The Working Class Must Exercise Leadership in Everything, 1970: This painting has similar figures to the 1991.6.1 . There is a crowd with a large figure of Chairman Mao. However, instead of having a gray scale, this painting is painted in bright colors to represent a new hope that leads to empowerment and happiness. In this painting, Chairman Mao is considered a bright leader who will bring joy and peace to the country. People in the crowd have a happy and confident look under the direction or plan of Chairman Mao. The Chairman is drawn bigger than the other figures. The artist intentionally puts more focused details on the Chairman character to emphasise his role as a big brother or father that is pointing or leading people to a better place. 30th Mary: This painting is still under the Cynical Realists and bald head figures . In this painting, the background and the children are painted in bright colours . Besides, figures are located in the spiral pattern in which children are flying back to heaven. There are two different critical approaches to this picture. One approach is that this painting reveals a new hope for the young generation that can change the future of China. People have hopes on the youths that they can restructure or remodel the society so that everybody can have a voice and everybody lives in freedom. The other approach describes death as a relief from this life. Because life is too stressful or too complicated, death becomes the best solution to escape from this world to go to a more peaceful place such as heaven. \\"China/Avant-Garde\\" exhibition This exhibition took place in February 1989. It was first denied access by the government. Some of the artists decided to move the artist's villages to begin to make a \\"department art\\". The target audience of the artists was not the public but other artists/painters among their circle of friends. Fang Lijun's works were shown during this exhibition. Due to the different economic and political times, there was a lot of attention that was being drawn from this exhibition among the artists. The intention was to motivate the movement of the society to reinforce a new structure of China. When the corruption happened, people started getting lost in direction of where to go or how to change the country. The China/Avant-garde called people together to make a bigger change, to fire up different movements that happened right after this exhibition New Generation exhibition This New Generation exhibition was held to draw people's attention to the Cynical Realism. This took place in July 1991 in the National History Museum in Beijing. There were many new major painters such as Fang Lijun, Liu Wei, Song Yonghong, who participated and helped with this event. This exhibition is known as a starter for the trend of realistic painting. In this event, Fang Lijun and other new painters introduced new ideas on society, painting and art critique. His paintings in this exhibition mostly focused on the national identity, cultural change and other related issues through stereotypical bald head men, family style and people's faces.  Reception in Europe  In October 2002, when Rolf Lauter became director of the Kunsthalle Mannheim, he met Alexander Ochs, an art dealer from Berlin, and asked him about showing young artists from Asia, especially China, with his support in the museum. In 2003, Lauter presented loans from Fang Lijun, Yue Minjun and Yang Shaobin in his second re-presenting of the collection in a temporary exhibition on the subject of \\"SelfSpace\\" with 19th century portrait sculptures by Maillol and Rodin, light boxes by Jeff Wall and works by Alex Katz. Especially the work \\"SARS\\" (later named \\"Untitled\\") by Fang Lijun, a large-format woodcut, attracted attention. Lauter wrote in his introductory text: \\"Opposed to the pictures by Katz is a work composed of seven printed scroll paintings in the size 400 x 854 cm by the Chinese artist Fang Lijun. In addition to a rising tendency towards \\"de-individualisation\\" of people, his work labeled \\"SARS\\" also addresses the \\"glowing\\" danger of the virus for the crowds in China\\"Rolf Lauter, Die Neue Kunsthalle II: nat√ºrlich ‚Äì k√∂rperlich ‚Äì sinnlich / The New Kunsthalle: natural - physical - sensual, Kunsthalle Mannheim, November 24, 2003 ‚Äì March 7, 2004, Booklet of the exhibition.

Their senior men's team currently plays in the Ulster Senior League. In 1986‚Äì87 they were both founding members and inaugural champions of the USL. They remain the USL's most successful club, having won fourteen titles. They also field teams in both the Donegal Youth League and the Donegal Women's League. They have previously fielded teams in both the A Championship and the League of Ireland U19 Division. They have also played in the FAI Cup, the League of Ireland Cup and the FAI Intermediate Cup. They have won the latter competition on two occasions, in 1987‚Äì88 and 1994‚Äì95. History Early years Fanad United was founded in 1972 by Fr. Michael Sweeney, a pioneer of junior and intermediate association football in County Donegal. In addition to founding Fanad United, Sweeney was also instrumental in establishing two leagues the club initially played in, the Donegal League and the Ulster Senior League. He has also served on the board of Finn Harps. Between 1972 and 1973 and 1983‚Äì84 Fanad United were Donegal champions five times before becoming both founding members and the inaugural champions of the USL in 1986‚Äì87. They subsequently became the USL's most successful club, winning fourteen league titles and ten league cups. National cups Fr. Michael Sweeney also served as Fanad United's team manager and he was responsible for guiding the club to victory in two national cup competitions. In 1978‚Äì79 United won the FAI Youth Cup after defeating Shelbourne U19 3‚Äì1 in the final at Swilly Park. In 1987‚Äì88 they won the FAI Intermediate Cup after defeating Tramore Athletic 1‚Äì0 at Dalymount Park. Under player-manager Eamon McConigley, Fanad United won the FAI Intermediate Cup for a second time in 1994‚Äì95, this time defeating College Corinthians in the final at Terryland Park. In 1995‚Äì96 they were finalists for a second successive season but lost to Wayside Celtic. As winners of the Ulster Senior League, Fanad United have regularly been invited to participate in the League of Ireland Cup. Their best performance in this competition came in 1987‚Äì88 when they reached the semi- finals. After they finished top of their group, following three wins against Sligo Rovers, Derry City and Finn Harps, they qualified for the quarter-finals where they defeated Galway United 1‚Äì0. In the semi-final they lost 4‚Äì1 to Shamrock Rovers. Fanad United have also achieved some notable results in the FAI Cup. In 1991‚Äì92, despite going down to nine men, they defeated Home Farm 2‚Äì0 away from home in the first round. In the second round they held St James's Gate to two 1‚Äì1 draws before eventually losing 3‚Äì2 in the second replay. In 1995‚Äì96 they defeated Bray Wanderers 4‚Äì0 at the Carlisle Grounds before losing 3‚Äì0 to St Patrick's Athletic in the round of sixteen. In the 2005 FAI Cup they played Shamrock Rovers at Dalymount Park losing 2‚Äì0. National leagues In 2011 Fanad United entered a team in the A Championship. They subsequently finished fourth in their group of eight. When the A Championship was disbanded Fanad United joined the League of Ireland U19 Division. Buncrana tragedy In March 2016 Fanad United player Davitt Walsh came to national attention when he rescued a baby, Rioghnach-Ann McGrotty, following a tragic incident in Buncrana. Walsh risked his life while saving Rioghnach-Ann from drowning after the family car she was in accidentally slipped off the pier. Her two brothers, father, aunt and grandmother all lost their lives in the accident. Walsh's bravery was recognised by the Irish Government and he was awarded a gallantry medal by Shane Ross, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

It peaked at #20 on the Top Independent Albums chart and at #186 on the Billboard 200. Music The music of Only in Amerika incorporates elements of hip-hop, hardcore punk and heavy metal. Johnny Loftus wrote that Only in Amerika is a \\"thrash-hop spew [which] takes cues from Anthrax, Korn, Dirty South, pre-acting career Ice-T, and the uncompromising Psychopathic Records collective.\\" Lyrical themes Jared Gomes later revealed that the brash, offensive lyrical content was an intentional backlash against the more commercial and radio friendly sound of Blackout, the band's previous album, which Gomes said was the product of Jive Records trying to shape the band into a mainstream act and shift its sound away from its punk rock roots. According to Gomes, \\"With Only in Amerika, I was trying to push buttons and provoke people. I was exercising my right to freedom of speech\\". Gomes expresses nationalistic themes in the song \\"War\\", and elsewhere on the album, calling for retaliation against Al Qaeda for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Reception In his review of the album, Johnny Loftus wrote that \\"[the album] wants to be a confrontational megaphone in the ear of conservatives, but Jahred's torrential rhetoric is too messy and blatantly offensive to incite anything but superficial anger, and the music -- though occasionally explosive -- takes a backseat to the ranting.\\" Track listing Personnel ;(Hed) Planet Earth *Jahred (Jared Gomes) - Vocals *Mawk (Mark Young) - Bass *Jaxon (Jaxon Benge) - Guitar *Moke (Mark Bistany) - Drums *DJ Product ¬© 1969 (Doug Boyce) - Turntables ;Production *Produced by Jahred Gomes & Sean E *Mixed by Jahred Gomes, Chris Holmes & Ryan Boesch *Drum mix by Chris Holmes & Ryan Boesch *Drums engineering by Ryan Boesch *A&R; by Cliff Cultreri *Marketing by John Franck *Management by DAS Communications, Ltd. *Design by Jeff Gilligan *Artwork by DJ Product ¬© 1969 *Logo by Stuart Chamberlain & Jahred Gomes *Photo by Greg Watermann References Category:2004 albums Category:Hed PE albums Category:Rap rock albums by American artists ","title":"Only in Amerika"},{"id":"8132272","text":"Sheridan Road is a major north-south street that leads from Diversey Parkway in Chicago, Illinois, north to the Illinois-Wisconsin border and beyond to Racine. Throughout most of its run, it is the easternmost north-south through street, closest to Lake Michigan. From Chicago, it passes through Chicago's wealthy lakeside North Shore suburbs, and then Waukegan and Zion, until it reaches the Illinois-Wisconsin state line in Winthrop Harbor. In Wisconsin, the road leads north through Pleasant Prairie and Kenosha, until it ends on the south side of Racine. From North Chicago to the state line, Sheridan Road is signed as part of Illinois Route 137 in Illinois, and Wisconsin Highway 32 through Kenosha and Racine in Wisconsin. Sheridan Road is known for its historic sites, lakefront parks, and gracious mansion homes in Evanston through Lake Bluff. Chicago path * It runs at 400 west from 2800 north (Diversey Pkwy) to 3181 north (Belmont Ave). * It runs at 3900 north from 600 (Lake Shore Dr) west to 956 west (Sheffield Ave). * It runs at 1000 west from 3900 north (Byron St) to 6356 north. * It runs at 6400 north from 970 west to 1158 west (Broadway). * It runs at 1200 west from 6400 north (Broadway/Devon Av) to 6756 north (Pratt Blvd). * It runs from 1200 west at 6800 north to 1400 west at 7800 north (northern city limit). History A suburban extension of Chicago's Lake Shore Drive to Waukegan was first promoted by the North Shore Improvement Association in the late 1880s. In 1889 this road was named Sheridan Road for Philip Henry Sheridan, a general in the Civil War who coordinated military relief efforts in Chicago following the Great Chicago Fire. Much of the route had been laid out by 1893, and in 1894 it was proposed that the new road should be extended to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Progress on the construction of the road was slowed by local opposition in some of the communities that it was to pass through, and construction was not completed until 1918. A statue of Sheridan by artist Gutzon Borglum was placed alongside Sheridan Road and Belmont Avenue in Chicago's Lincoln Park in 1924. Sheridan Road in Illinois was once signed as Illinois Route 42. The route was first shown on official maps in 1924; the original route ran along Sheridan Road from the Wisconsin border to Waukegan, then turned west along Washington Street, south along Green Bay Road (now part of IL 131), east along Rockland Road (now part of IL 176) before running south along Waukegan Road (now mostly part of IL 43). In 1925, Route 42 was realigned to include all of Sheridan Road in Illinois; the route continued south to the Indiana border at Hammond, and the old route became Illinois Route 42A. In 1929, the southern terminus of Route 42 was changed to the south end of Sheridan Road as US 41 supplanted the southern part of the route. This made the route coextensive with the Illinois portion of Sheridan Road. Sheridan Road was marked as Route 42 until the highway was removed from the state highway system in 1972.

The dotted green line in the Aegean Sea notes the Italian Islands of the Aegean, already under Italian control. Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne; version ratified between the Allies, subject to the consent of Russia (which was never achieved), in August 1917 The Agreement of St.-Jean-de-Maurienne was an agreement between France, Italy and Great Britain, which emanated from a conference in a railway car at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne on April 19, 1917, and signed by the allies between August 18 ‚Äì September 26, 1917. The 19 April meeting was attended by British and French Prime Ministers, David Lloyd George Alexandre Ribot, and the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Paolo Boselli and Sidney Sonnino. It was intended as a tentative agreement to settle the Italian Middle Eastern interest - specifically article 9 of the Treaty of London (1915). The agreement was needed by the allies to secure the position of Italian forces in the Middle East. The goal was to balance the military power drops at the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I as Russian (Tsarist) forces were pulling out of the Caucasus Campaign, even though they were replaced with what would be named as Democratic Republic of Armenian forces.C.J. Lowe, and M.L. Dockrill, The Mirage of Power: British Foreign Policy 1914-22 (vol 2 1972) pp 223-27 Russia was not represented in this agreement as the Tsarist regime was in a state of collapse (see Russian Revolution of 1917). However, the lack of Russian consent to the Saint-Jean- de-Maurienne agreement was used by the British at the 1919 Paris Peace conference to invalidate it, a position that greatly incensed the Italian government.Helmreich, p.131: \\"Given these facts, plus the circumstances surrounding the fall of the Russian government and its withdrawa'l from the war in late 1917 and early 1918, it is easy to understand why Sonnino was so incensed, particularly at the British, for their invocation of the Russian consent clause as a means of invalidating the St. Jean agreement at the Peace Conference in 1919.\\" Background The representatives of Great Britain, France, Russia and Italy met in London in 1915 to sign an agreement providing for Italy‚Äôs entrance to the First World War. Italy‚Äôs part in the Middle East was left unsettled; the agreement stated that if the Ottoman Empire was partitioned, Italy should receive a \\"just share\\" in the Antalya district. The borders of this occupation were to be decided at a later time. 19 April Meeting Six days after the meeting, the British War Cabinet approved a note to be sent to the Italians stating that they \\"agree conditionally\\" to the proposal made at the conference, whilst pointing out that the Italian contribution the war was yet to justify it. Helmreich, p.110 The French government sent a similar communication on 10 May. Helmreich, p.110 The 19 April meeting discussed the concept of Italian influence after the war. It was clear to the Italians that the area allotted to them may not be easily given up by the Turkish Empire, such that the British Prime Minister proposed a vague formula for post-war adjustment should the actual post-war allocation not appear to be balanced. The minutes of the meeting are below: > M. Ribot made objections regarding assignment of Mersina and Adana to Italy, > but admitted facilities should be granted to commerce of the Interior in the > direction of Mersina as in the case of Alexandretta and Haifa. The Italian > zone will commence at a point to be determined west of Mersina. Baron > Sonnino asked for the inclusion in Italian zone of occupation of everything > which so figures on Mr. Balfour's map. He asked, besides, that the northern > part of the vilayet of Smyrna be also included. Mr. Lloyd George and M. > Ribot undertake to submit this claim to their Governments. It was agreed > that the interests of the other Powers already established in the different > zones shall he scrupulously respected, but that the Powers concerned in > these interests shall not make use of them as a means of political action. > An exchange of views took place as to the situation which might result for > the Allied Powers at the moment of peace with respect to the Ottoman Empire. > After the discussion. Mr Lloyd George made the following proposal. which was > accepted: ‚Äî :It is agreed that if, at the time when peace is made, the total > or partial possession of territories contemplated in the agreements > concluded between France, Great Britain, Italy and Russia as regards > attribution to them of a part of the Ottoman Empire, could not be granted > entirely to one or several of the Powers in question, then the interests of > those Powers would he taken afresh into equitable consideration In a general > way. the Ministers undertook to recommend the above decisions to their > Governments. Subsequent discussions The British and French governments added a number of conditions to the proposed Italian sphere of influence which had not been discussed between the prime ministers at the 19 April conference.

Zuckschwerdt preempted the confiscation of his ship by the Americans by igniting preplanted explosives and scuttling her in Apra Harbor. Seven of the German sailors on board died, and Zuckschwerdt spent the rest of the war as a POW.  Career before the SMS Cormoran incident  Zuckschwerdt joined the Imperial German Navy on 4 April 1893 and served in different positions on land and sea. From 1902 to 1904 he served as navy officer in the German Colony Kiautschou Bay concession.

He arrived at the city harbour on 30 May 1914. At the beginning of World War I Zuckschwerdt's ship was decommissioned and he and his crew switched to a newly commissioned German Raider, a former civil vessel, captured by the German Cruiser shortly before. The new ship was also named SMS Cormoran.  After World War I  Zuckschwerdt was set free in 1919 and returned to Germany, where he got promoted to the rank of Fregattenkapit√§n. After being shortly dismissed he joined the newly founded Reichsmarine (the German Navy in the Weimar Republic). On 19 February 1920 he received the promotion to the rank of Captain at sea (Kapit√§n zur See).

Career Peterson was vice chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1961 to 1963 and a candidate for U.S. Senator from Michigan in 1964. Asked to run by Governor George W. Romney, Peterson would later comment that she picked up the gauntlet and ran for the Senate because no one else would run against the popular incumbent, Philip Hart, particularly in a year with her party divided over its presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater. Winning just 35.3 percent of the vote, she nevertheless bettered Goldwater's tally in Michigan‚Äî33.1 percent‚Äîand did so with little funds; to accomplish that much was a tribute to her energy, organization and down-to-earth appeal. In 1965, Peterson became the first woman to serve as chair of the Michigan Republican Party. In 1965, Peterson was also the first woman in U.S. history to chair a Republican state central committee, until 1969.

Inquisitive and probing, she was also quick to laugh and often referred to as \\"mother\\" by her interns, such as Christine Todd Whitman. Friendly and un-dogmatic, while in Washington she shared a house with the prominent Democrat Liz Carpenter, who'd been press secretary for Lady Bird Johnson and a speech-writer for Vice President Lyndon Johnson. An egalitarian by philosophy and example, Peterson was a national co-chairwoman of ERAmerica, a private national campaign organization, during the fight to get the Equal Rights Amendment ratified. Peterson also strongly supported abortion rights and was a charter member in the National Women's Political Caucus. At this time, in the early 1970s, the conservative wing of the Republican Party was beginning to create friction with the liberal members, Peterson amongst them. She successfully battled to keep Phyllis Schlafly from seizing control of the National Federation of Republican Women, but she was experiencing reduced affinity with the Republican National Convention platform and by 1983 endorsed James Blanchard, the Democrat running for governor of Michigan, rather than the conservative Republican.

(Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana) Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201 ‚Äì ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouv√®re perhaps best known for the Bestiaire d'amour (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\").Master Richard's Bestiary of Love and Response, trans. Jeanette Beer (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1986; reprinted West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press, 2000). Life Richard de Fournival was born in Amiens on October 10, 1201. He was the son of Roger de Fournival (a personal physician to King Philip Augustus) and √âlisabeth de la Pierre. He was also half-brother of Arnoul, bishop of Amiens (1236‚Äì46).L'Oeuvre lyrique de Richard de Fournival, ed. Yvan G. Lepage (Ottawa: √âditions de l'Universit√© d'Ottawa, 1981), p. 9. Richard was successively canon, deacon, and chancellor of the cathedral chapter of Notre Dame d'Amiens. He was also a licensed surgeon, by the authority of Pope Gregory IX and this privilege was confirmed a second time in 1246 by Pope Innocent IV.Lepage, p. 10. He died on March 1, either 1260 or 1259.Lepage, p. 11. Writings Richard also wrote several other works besides the prose Bestiaire d'amour: the , , , De vetula and Amisti√© de vraie amour. In addition, he composed a list of his own books entitled the Biblionomia, the Nativitas (an astrological autobiography), and the De arte alchemica.Lepage, pp. 12-14. The Biblionomia The Biblionomia is a list of 162 volumes (some containing more than one work), divided into grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry and arithmetic, music and astronomy, philosophy, and poetry.The Latin transcription was printed by L√©opold Delisle, Le cabinet des manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que nationale (Paris, 1874), vol. 2, pp. 518-535. This was reprinted, along with a facsimile of the manuscript from the Sorbonne, in H. J. De Vleeschauwer, ‚ÄúLa Biblionomia de Richard de Fournival‚Äù, Mousaion (Pretoria: University of South Africa), vol. 62 (1965). Whether this was an ideal library or a real one is uncertain. But we can say, however, that at least 35 volumes have been identified as items in medieval libraries (e.g., the Sorbonne) and still existing in various modern libraries (e.g., the Biblioth√®que nationale de France),For instance, BnF, ms lat 6602 (Fournival‚Äôs no. 31), ms lat 16646 (no. 37), ms lat 16647 (no. 38), and ms lat 16648 (no 40).

The list (and its latest possible date of 1260) does allow us to date certain medieval writings. For instance, the inclusion of various works by Jordanus de Nemore ‚Äì his Liber philotegni (Fournival no. 43), the De ratione ponderis (no. 43), an Algorismus (no. 45), his Arithmetic (no. 47), the De numeris datis (no. 48) and the De plana spera (no. 59) ‚Äì is our only information on when Jordanus must have lived, i.e., before 1260. His library Richard's library (of which the Biblionomia must be in part a catalogue) passed to G√©rard d'Abbeville, an archdeacon at Amiens, who then left many of them to the recently established Coll√®ge de Sorbonne. Some of these volumes then passed to the Royal Library (now the Biblioth√®que nationale de France) in the 18th century.Birkenmajer, pp. 167 and 214.

Ferguson Marine (Port Glasgow) Ltd. is a shipbuilding company, with a yard located in Port Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde in Scotland. It is the last remaining shipbuilder on the lower Clyde, and is currently the only builder of merchant ships on the river - the company's mainstay has long been Roll-on/roll-off ferries, primarily for Caledonian MacBrayne, the largest of which will operate between Ardrossan and Isle of Arran. Ferguson's also built three of the world's first roll-on/roll-off Hybrid powered car ferries , and . As of June 2020, work is in progress on MV Glen Sannox, which is also Ferguson's largest product ever built. History The Ferguson shipyard was founded as a partnership by four Ferguson Brothers (Peter, Daniel, Louis and Robert) who left the Fleming & Ferguson shipyard in Paisley to lease the Newark yard in Port Glasgow in March 1903. Ferguson Brothers acquired the freehold in the yard in 1907 and was incorporated as Ferguson Brothers (Port Glasgow) Ltd in 1912. The company was purchased by John Slater Ltd (Amalgamated Industries) in 1918 but returned to control of the Ferguson family in the late 1920s. Lithgows Ltd purchased an interest in the business after Bobby Ferguson's death in 1954 and took control of the Company in 1961. Ferguson Brothers remained a separate entity within the Scott Lithgow group from 1969 to 1977. Entrance to Ferguson Shipbuilders, with the original office building and fabrication shed built to the line of the railway branch which once served the harbour. The company was nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977, then merged with the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company to form Ferguson- Ailsa Ltd in 1980. Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd Ferguson and Ailsa were separated in 1986 when the latter yard was sold and Ferguson was merged with Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon to form Appledore Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd. By the late 1980s only the Appledore Ferguson yards were still held in state ownership. Ferguson was demerged from Appledore and acquired by Greenock-based engineering firm Clark Kincaid in 1989 and started trading as Ferguson Shipbuilders. Clark Kincaid itself was acquired by Kvaerner and became Kvaerner Kincaid in 1990, and the Ferguson yard sold to Ferguson Marine plc in 1991. The entire shareholding in Ferguson Marine was acquired by the Holland House Electrical Group in 1995. The sign above the main gate continued the name Ferguson Shipbuilders Limited. Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd. New office building and entrance moved near the A8 road, Glen Sannox and Hull 802 in 2017. In August 2014, the shipyard placed the company into administration and the following month Clyde Blowers Capital, an industrial company owned by Jim McColl, purchased the yard for ¬£600,000 and renamed it Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL). In August 2015, government-owned Caledonian Maritime Assets announced that an order for two ferries for Caledonian MacBrayne service, capable of operating on either marine diesel oil or liquefied natural gas, had been won by Fergusons. Originally intended for delivery during 2018, construction difficulties (the reasons for which are in dispute) have led to a two-year delay for the first ship, Glen Sannox, which was launched in November 2017. FMEL was part of two consortia's bids for the programme for five type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy, worth some ¬£1.25 billion. The consortia are those led by Babcock International and Atlas Elektronik UK. After their bid was selected, a contract was formally awarded to Babcock Group on 15 November 2019, for an average production cost of ¬£250 million per ship and an overall programme cost set to be ¬£2 billion. On 30 October 2018, FMEL secured a contract to construct a large air cushioned barge for Mangistau ACV Solutions Ltd, part of the CMI Offshore Ltd Group, with estimated completion scheduled in 2019. In December 2018 FMEL announced that two orders worth ¬£5.4 million had been secured from Inverlussa Marine Services for fish farm support ships, to be completed in May 2019, and that three more for fishing vessels, totaling ¬£11 million, were in the pipeline. By July 2019 the ferry dispute had led to delays in closing the trawler contracts. Ferguson Marine from the east, across Coronation Park, with MV Glen Sannox still at Newark Quay, lacking progress since being launched. Attempts by Clyde Blowers Capital to negotiate with the Scottish Government over the increased costs and delays to ferries failed, and on 9 August 2019 the directors of FMEL gave notice that the company would be put into administration. A week later the Scottish Government announced that they would take over management of the yard to allow work to continue on current orders, and that if no private buyer could be found in four weeks, the yard would be nationalised by purchase. At the start of December, after three private bids to purchase the yard were rejected as being insufficiently favourable to creditors, the government formally took ownership of the shipyard, and in the process wrote off about ¬£50 million of previous loans. Ferguson Marine (Port Glasgow) Ltd. The newly nationalised shipyard was renamed Ferguson Marine (Port Glasgow) Ltd. as of 2 December 2019. The costs and viability of completing contracts was investigated, and Tim Hair was appointed as turnaround director. On 22 January 2020 he told a Scottish Parliament inquiry that the large ferries and Hull 802 were \\"significantly less than half built\\", with 95% of their design still to be agreed with the client body Caledonian Maritime Assets. Additional naval architects and marine engineers had been engaged to complete this design work. In March 2020 Ferguson Marine announced that they had taken a four year lease on a large warehouse sited at Greenock waterfront, and would use it to consolidate stock and materials which had been stored in several warehouses near Glasgow Airport. The large air cushioned barge for CMI Offshore Ltd (ordered from FMEL in 2018) was launched on 24 June 2020, to be taken to the Caspian Sea to be completed and outfitted for oil exploration work in that area. The company's board of directors with six non‚Äìexecutive members, including Alistair Mackenzie as chairman, was appointed in June 2020 by the Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary Fiona Hyslop.

He later served in the New Mexico Territory. Early military career Dudley led the 30th Massachusetts Volunteers and spent time as an aide to Nathaniel Prentice Banks, Major General of Volunteers and commander of the XIX Corps. At the beginning of the War he was serving as a regular army captain, commanding Company E of the 10th U.S. Infantry Regiment. On January 19, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Dudley for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from the same date, January 19, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 744 After the war he reverted to his regular rank and transferred to the Third U. S. Cavalry. He eventually was promoted to Lt. Colonel of the Ninth Cavalry and finally to Colonel of the First U. S. Cavalry. He spent much of his career on the Indian frontier and did much good service which has been somewhat overshadowed by his part in the Lincoln County War. He was well-liked by his men but often not so well-liked by his fellow officers. He was convicted at two Courts-Martial of offenses that could have ended his career, and Colonel Hatch of the Ninth Cavalry tried to get Dudley retired as being unfit for service due to alcohol. Dudley, however, had friends in high places. Lincoln County War Dudley's part in the Lincoln County War of 1877‚Äì1879 in New Mexico Territory is at best controversial and at worst despicable and incompetent. He was the commanding officer of the local Fort Stanton. Despite orders not to interfere in civilian matters, he did, nominally to protect civilians, but in fact, he seems to have favored the Murphy-Dolan faction throughout the range war. Attempts to have him removed as commander went all the way to the Secretary of War, but were refused. Susan McSween, the wife of one of the key participants, Alexander McSween, had charges filed in 1879 against Dudley. Dudley was removed by General Hatch as commander on March 7, 1879, and a court of inquiry into his actions was commissioned. In July 1879, the inquiry ruled that a court martial against Dudley was not justified, and Dudley was transferred to Fort Union, also in New Mexico Territory. In November 1879 Dudley was also found not guilty in his trial for an arson, a crime committed during the Battle of Lincoln. Susan McSween's husband, Alexander, was shot and killed while unarmed, and in the presence of Col. Dudley, while McSween was fleeing the burning house. Subsequent career Towards the end of his career, he assisted Colonel George Buell's expedition against the Apache chief Victorio, which indirectly led to Victorio's death at the hands of the Mexican army. In 1887, as a colonel of the 1st Cavalry, he helped suppress the rebellion on the Crow reservation, during which the leader of a faction of the Crow, Sword Bearer, was killed. Promoted in 1904, during his retirement, to regular army brigadier general, Dudley died in 1910, aged 84, and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery under an ornate tombstone of his own design.

Life Born at Highbury Place, Islington, 24 July 1787, he was the second son of George Ward (died 1829), of Northwood Park, Cowes, a London merchant and large landowner in the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, by his wife Mary (died 1813), daughter of Henry Sampson Woodfall. Robert Plumer Ward was his uncle. He was educated at Winchester College. Ward was destined for commerce, and spent some time at Antwerp in a banking-house. On his return his father took him into partnership in 1810. In 1817 he was elected a director of the Bank of England, known as an expert on foreign exchanges. In 1819 he gave evidence before the parliamentary committees on the restrictions on payments in cash by the Bank of England. On 9 June 1826 he became Member of Parliament in the Tory interest for the City of London, and in 1830 at the request of the Duke of Wellington, he acted as chairman of the committee appointed to investigate the affairs of the East India Company, before the opening of the China trade. In 1831, discontented at the spirit of reform, he declined to stand for parliament. In 1835 he presented himself as a candidate, and was defeated by the Whigs; and retired from public life. Ward died on 30 June 1849 in London at Wyndham Place. Cricketing career William Ward was a prominent right-handed batsman and an occasional slow lob bowler. His first-class career began in the 1810 English cricket season but it was interrupted by the Napoleonic War until 1816. Ward played until 1845. His score of 278 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) v Norfolk at Lord's in 1820 was the highest individual innings in first-class cricket until W. G. Grace scored first-class cricket's first triple-century in August 1876, more than 27 years after Ward's death. The ball used is thought to be the oldest in existence and is kept in the MCC Museum. In 1825 Thomas Lord was negotiating the sale of his cricket ground as a building estate when Ward stepped in and saved Lord's for cricket. The price was ¬£5000. He was celebrated in the following anonymous poem. > :And of all who frequent the ground named after Lord, :On the list first and > foremost should stand Mr Ward. :No man will deny, I am sure, when I say > :That he's without rival first bat of the day, :And although he has grown a > little too stout, :Even Matthews is bothered at bowling him out. :He's our > life blood and soul in this noblest of games, :And yet on our praises he's > many more claims; :No pride, although rich, condescending and free, :And a > well informed man and a city M.P. John Nyren dedicated his famous book The Young Cricketer's Tutor to Ward when it appeared in 1833. He described Ward as \\"the most worthy man of the day to reflect credit upon my choice as a patron\\".Barclay's World of Cricket ‚Äì 2nd Edition, 1980, Collins Publishers, , p. 9. More recently, Ward was mentioned in The Duckworth Lewis Method's song, \\"Gentlemen and Players\\". > :A bored young William Ward MP. :Bought Lord's from Thomas Lord :In eighteen > twenty five. The lyric is slightly inaccurate since Ward did not become an MP until 1826. Works In 1847 Ward published Remarks on the Monetary Legislation of Great Britain (London), in which he condemned the act of 1816 establishing an exclusive gold standard, and called for a bi-metallic currency. Family On 26 April 1811 he married Emily, fifth daughter of Harvey Christian Combe, a London alderman.

The new parish, also established in 1838, was created out of part of the parish of St Mary de Castro Church. In 1872, Holy Trinity was completely redesigned by Samuel Sanders Teulon in a High Gothic style, with spire and side turrets in red-purple brick with limestone decoration. During the 19th century the church had wooden pews and a single central aisle, with balconies on both sides of the church; the central aisle was occupied by the middle classes and the balconies by their servants. Access to ground floor was via the main church entrance, with two side entrances for the balconies.

The chancel end wall has five arched stained glass windows featuring contemporary designs of the Parable of The Sower (see Matthew 12:1-24), above which there is a more traditional floral design including an emblem of the Trinity, with smaller windows featuring \\"The Truth\\" and \\"The Life\\", but there is not a window depicting \\"The Way\\" (see John 14:6). The chancel marble end wall also features a depiction of the Last Supper. The pipe organ was transferred to a church in the Netherlands in mid-2018. The church and nearby buildings are now part of the New Walk conservation area.  Present  Holy Trinity is a Mission-Shaped church, where church members belong to mid-sized Mission Shaped Communities (MSCs) based around geographical locations, social networks or interests. Holy Trinity states that its vision is to \\"be a community that glorifies God by transforming Leicester and beyond.\\" The church community is made up of a range of different ages, including many children and young people and a large population of University Students. Holy Trinity is also connected with the ministry of the Charismatic Evangelical movement New Wine and John McGinley, the Vicar, is New Wine's designated leader of Church Planting. The church is actively involved in outreach into the local communities in Leicester including an expanding ministry to the city's Homeless called \\"Triangle\\". Holy Trinity runs the Alpha course throughout the year as well as a multimedia and arts table-talk style event called \\"Questions\\", pioneered by the previous vicar, Roger Morgan. The Sunday services follow a theme during each term. The morning services are family-oriented with music by a live band, and the evening tends to attract more students and young adults. At each service the sermon is recorded and later made available as a podcast; sermons can be downloaded individually from the church website in MP3 audio format. Average attendance at the Sunday services totals 500. Organ The organ of 1901, by J. Porritt of Leicester The organ was removed in May 2018.

This song also has been used as a running cadence in the military.Francke, Linda Bird. Ground Zero: The Gender Wars in the Military. 1997. pgs. 190-91.  Lyrics and copyright  According to the Harry Fox Agency, BMG & ASCAP the song has not been registered for royalty purposes although there is a song titled \\"The S&M; Girl\\" in the BMG database. Since this is a modern song, it might be copyrightable; however, as a parody, it is a derivative work and could be subject to questions of fair use by a parody. Like sung limericks, many, if not most verses to \\"The S&M; Man\\" are bawdy or at least off-color. Each person offers up a verse which was spontaneously created or modified and, also like limericks, the chorus is sung collectively allowing someone time to pick out a new individual to sing the next verse. Each time the song is sung it is different based upon the people present and the verses they remember or create.  History of the song  The earliest print date for this song is 1990 in the public domain book The Official Rugby Book (and Other Strange Stuff) issued by Cap Pelletier. The song is found on page 203 of the first edition, ninth revision of that book. Since that date, \\"The S&M; Man\\" has appeared in many printed and digital songbooks. Some of these books are listed below: * 7440th Combat Song Book (28 February 1991) * The Songbook of Sigma Pi (ca 1990) * Definitive Hash Songbook (January 1994) by ZiPpY * Untitled Text Files (1994) deposited at the Library of Congress Folklife Archive by Paul Woodford. This is song #164 of that collection (American Folklife Collection accession number AFC 1995/023). * Half-Mind Hymnal (1996-2008) by Flying Booger *McMaster Engineering Song Book 2014 by Mac Eng. This song book was made public in early 2014, which was followed by the immediate suspension of all those involved. Obviously the song book was published as soon as possible. The S&M; man is found on the last page. By 1994 the song was so well known that a version for women, \\"The S&M; Girl\\", started appearing in songbooks.  References  * Cray, Ed.

History The Stern School was founded by Charles Waldo Haskins (an alumnus of New York University Tandon School of Engineering) in 1900 as the Undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance on the University's Washington Square campus. In 1913, Jeanette Hamill, J.D., M.A., joined the school's Economics department, becoming its first female faculty member. In 1936, women comprised 15 percent of the total enrollment. Graduate School of Business Administration The Graduate School of Business Administration was launched in 1916, and was housed in the NYU's School of Commerce's Wall Street branch.\\"In 1916, the School of Commerce's Wall Street branch became the home of New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration (GBA).\\" Located in New York's downtown business district, the school's \\"Wall Street Division\\" served both full-time and currently employed students. The graduate school's first dean was appointed in 1921. By 1945, the school's enrollment was well over 10,000 with graduates hailing from 36 countries and 48 states. In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959‚Äì1966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970. Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration The School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster (see also: Bobst Library and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college. Stern's donation In 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated. In 1998, a $10 million gift from Henry Kaufman (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor Kenneth Langone (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid. Peter Blair Henry became dean of the school in January 2010. In 2010, the renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed. This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.

There are three Michels mentioned in connection with this work. There is Bishop Jean Michel of Angers (died 1447), a \\"Maistre Jehan Michel\\" who was first physician of King Charles VIII (died 1495), and the physician to the dauphin, son of Charles VIII (died 1501). The bishop is considered the least likely candididate for being the poet, having died too early, while the physician to the dauphin is the most likely, due to the latter also being associated with Angers, and the work being produced for the first time in its new shape at Angers in 1486. Besides his contributions to Gr√©ban's Passion, Jean Michel composed another mystery, a Resurrection, which was played at Angers on the occasion of King Ren√©'s visit to that city. Jean Michel has not the dryness of his predecessor; on the other hand he lacks his accuracy. He incorporates into his mysteries the most extravagant legends and the fantastic information found in the apocryphal writers. He delights in pictures of low city life in the fifteenth century, and his language is often realistic in the extreme.

Farming and fishing are the two main resources in the area. History The Mi'kmaq gave it its name which means \\"big marshes\\" because of the 343 hectares (837 acres) of salt marshland along the Chebogue River beginning at Arcadia. Other meanings for the area of Chebogue include \\"large tranquil river\\" and \\"narrow passage\\". Mi'kmaq stone tools were found nearby, dating from 5000 to 7000 years ago. Chebogue's known European history began in 1614 with the establishment of a permanent Acadian settlement. However the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, on a map dated 1607, has drawn buildings on both sides of a river which is probably the Chebogue River. That would make Chebogue the third oldest European settlement in Canada after Sainte-Croix in 1604 and Port Royal, Nova Scotia in 1605. An habitation or fort and trading post was built here by David Lomeron, a merchant from La Rochelle, France. It was however destroyed by the Kirke brothers in 1628. Chebogue was also referred to as Port Lomeron and Fort Lomeron in some accounts of the time. The Acadian community of Chebogue received an influx of settlers in 1740. A chapel, Sainte-Anne, was constructed on Durkee Island. It was one of the most important Acadian communities in south western Nova Scotia at the time. However in 1758 the entire settlement was destroyed and the Acadian inhabitants deported. In 1761, English settlers from New England, called Planters, landed at Chebogue. They consisted of Captain Moses Perry, Ebenezer Ellis and Sealed Landers and their families. A plaque mounted besides the cemetery gate at Town Point in Chebogue commemorates this event. Another prominent initial settler was Ephraim Cook (mariner).

It was a best-of-seven series, with the East Division champion Boston Red Sox facing the Central Division champion Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox came back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit to defeat the Indians 4‚Äì3, outscoring them 30‚Äì5 over the final three games of the Series. The Red Sox had swept the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in three games in the AL Division Series, while the Indians had defeated the New York Yankees three games to one. The series marks the fourth postseason meeting of the two teams, following the 1995 and 1998 AL Division Series, both of which were won by the Indians, and the 1999 ALDS, won by the Red Sox (in a similar fashion to this series). It was the eighth ALCS appearance for Boston, and the fourth for Cleveland. The Red Sox would go on to sweep the Colorado Rockies in the World Series, winning their seventh World Series championship. The series was broadcast on Fox television. __TOC__ Summary Boston Red Sox vs. Cleveland Indians Game summaries Game 1 Friday, October 12, 2007 at Fenway Park in Boston In Game 1, the Cleveland Indians took the lead when Travis Hafner hit a home run to deep right field in the first inning against Josh Beckett, who retired the next ten batters in a row, finishing by striking out seven while allowing only two runs in six innings pitched. The Red Sox tied the game in the bottom of the inning off of CC Sabathia on three straight one-out singles by Kevin Youkilis, David Ortiz, and Manny Ramirez. In the third, the Red Sox loaded the bases with one out on a double, walk, and hit by pitch before Ramirez walked to force in a run, then Mike Lowell's ground-rule double scored two more. After Bobby Kielty was intentionally walked, Jason Varitek's groundout put Boston up 5‚Äì1. In the fifth, the Red Sox again loaded the bases on a single and two walks when Kielty's single scored two with Lowell being tagged out at third. Jensen Lewis relieved Sabathia and allowed an RBI double to Varitek. Sabathia was charged with eight runs on seven hits in innings. Casey Blake doubled to lead off the top of the sixth and scored on Asdr√∫bal Cabrera's single one out later. Dustin Pedroia and Youkilis hit back-to-back singles to lead off the bottom of the sixth. Aaron Fultz relieved Lewis and walked two to load the bases and force in a run. Tom Mastny relieved Fultz and allowed a sacrifice fly to Lowell to put the Red Sox up 10‚Äì2. The Indians scored their last run in the top of the eighth off of Javier L√≥pez when Blake hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a fly out, and scored on Cabrera's sacrifice fly. They loaded the bases with two outs off of √âric Gagn√© in the ninth, but Grady Sizemore struck out on a full count to end the game as the Red Sox went up 1‚Äì0 in the series. Game 2 Saturday, October 13, 2007 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts Game 2 was billed as a matchup of aces in 19-game winner Fausto Carmona and veteran postseason ace Curt Schilling. However, both starters were out by the fifth as both offenses took charge in what evolved into an 11-inning, run-scoring saga that clocked in at 5 hours and 14 minutes. After the Indians took the lead in the first on a Victor Martinez RBI double after a leadoff double by Grady Sizemore, the Red Sox loaded the bases in the third on two singles and a walk before a Manny Ram√≠rez walk tied the game, then Mike Lowell's two-run single put them up 3‚Äì1. In the top of the fourth, Jhonny Peralta hit a three-run blast into the camera well in center field off Schilling, giving the Indians a 4‚Äì3 lead. Sizemore's home run next inning made it 5‚Äì3 Indians. In the bottom of the inning, Manny Ramirez hit an opposite-field two-run home run to tie the game followed by a go-ahead Mike Lowell home run over the Green Monster, both off Indians reliever Rafael P√©rez. In the top of the sixth, Peralta drew a leadoff walk off of reliever Manny Delcarmen, moved to third on a single and scored on Franklin Gutierrez's groundout to tie the game 6‚Äì6. Each team's bullpen put up scoreless frames after the sixth inning, leading to extra innings. The 11th inning proved to be a historic one as Cleveland took advantage by scoring seven runs off a shaky Sox bullpen, a postseason record for runs in an extra inning by one team. One of the highlights was the go- ahead RBI base hit by former Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon off Boston's lefty specialist Javier L√≥pez after a one-out and single off of Eric Gagne. What made the base hit significant was that Nixon has historically struggled against left-handed pitching, but manager Eric Wedge left Nixon in to hit against L√≥pez, and the move paid off. A wild pitch allowed another run to score. After retiring V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez, L√≥pez gave up a single to Ryan Garko and was lifted for Jon Lester, the only pitcher left in the Boston bullpen. Lester did not fare much better; Peralta greeted him with a run-scoring double, which was followed one out later by Franklin Guti√©rrez's three-run homer, capping the scoring as the Indians took Game 2 by a score of 13‚Äì6, tying the series heading to Cleveland. Game 3 Monday, October 15, 2007 at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio Coming off a lopsided 13‚Äì6 loss in 11 innings, Boston sent Daisuke Matsuzaka to the mound to face off with Jake Westbrook for Game 3 at Jacobs Field. Kenny Lofton's two-run home run gave the Indians a 2‚Äì0 lead in the second inning. Dice-K would be knocked out after allowing RBI singles to Asdr√∫bal Cabrera and Travis Hafner to make it 4‚Äì0 in the fifth inning. Jason Varitek's two-run home run in the seventh inning off Westbrook cut the lead to 4‚Äì2, but the Sox could get no closer as Cleveland's closer Joe Borowski, who led the AL in saves during the regular season, shut the door on the Sox, giving the Indians a 2‚Äì1 lead in the series. Game 4 Tuesday, October 16, 2007 at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio After being confounded for four innings by Tim Wakefield's knuckleball, the Indians scored seven runs in the bottom of the fifth in Game 4. Casey Blake led off the inning with a homer off Wakefield, Franklin Guti√©rrez singled, Kelly Shoppach was hit by a pitch, and Grady Sizemore reached on a fielder's choice. After Kevin Youkilis bobbled and dropped a foul ball, Asdr√∫bal Cabrera reached on an infield single as Guti√©rrez scored. Travis Hafner struck out, and then V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez hit an RBI single to left. At that point, Boston skipper Terry Francona yanked Wakefield for reliever Manny Delcarmen, who gave up an opposite-field home run to Jhonny Peralta on a 2‚Äì1 pitch. Kenny Lofton followed with a single, then stole second‚Äîhis 34th career postseason stolen base, passing Rickey Henderson for first place on the all-time list‚Äîand scored on Blake's second base hit of the inning. Guti√©rrez struck out to end the inning, but the Indians had already scored seven runs‚Äîthe second time in this series in which the Indians plated seven in one inning. This also marks the third consecutive game in this ALCS wherein Boston's starter lasted only innings. The Red Sox answered immediately when Youkilis and David Ortiz hit back-to- back homers, chasing Indians starter Paul Byrd in favor of rookie reliever Jensen Lewis. Manny Ram√≠rez followed with another homer‚Äîthe Red Sox' third consecutive home run, something that had never before been accomplished in LCS history‚Äîin the top of the sixth inning. However, that would be all the offense the Red Sox could muster as the Indians took a three games to one lead in the series behind Lewis and fellow reliever Rafael Betancourt. Game 5 Thursday, October 18, 2007 at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio Danielle Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and Indians. Beckett was the starting pitcher in that game, and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett, since the pair had dated the previous summer. The Indians denied this claim. Cleveland also played the All American Rejects hit song \\"It Ends Tonight\\" before the game, predicting that the Indians would win and eliminate the Red Sox that evening. Facing elimination in Game 5, the Sox struck first with a home run from Kevin Youkilis in the top of the first inning off of CC Sabathia. The Indians answered right away, putting runners on first and third with nobody out but could only muster one run on Travis Hafner grounding into a double play. The Red Sox regained the lead in the third on a Manny Ram√≠rez RBI single, scoring David Ortiz from first. On the play, Ram√≠rez stopped at first base believing the ball hit beyond the yellow line on the outfield wall, but after discussion among the six umpires, the home run was disallowed and Ram√≠rez was left at first with a single. Meanwhile, Josh Beckett pitched eight dominant innings for the Red Sox, and collected 11 strikeouts, tying a career post-season high. Dustin Pedroia doubled to lead off the seventh and scored on Kevin Youkilis's triple. Rafael Betancourt relieved Sabathia and allowed a sacrifice fly to Ortiz to put Boston up 4‚Äì1. Next inning, Boston loaded the bases off of Rafael Perez on a walk, error, and single. Tom Mastny relieved Perez and threw a passed ball to Pedroia that let one run score. Mastny then walked Pedroia and Youkilis to reload the bases and force in another run. Ortiz's sacrifice fly then scored Boston's final run. Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth despite allowing a double and walk as the Red Sox's 7‚Äì1 win ensured a return trip to Boston for Game 6. Game 6 Saturday, October 20, 2007 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts After Curt Schilling retired the Indians in the top of the first, the Red Sox loaded the bases on infield hits by Dustin Pedroia and Kevin Youkilis plus a full-count walk to David Ortiz. Fausto Carmona struck out Manny Ram√≠rez and got Mike Lowell to pop out, but J. D. Drew then hit a grand slam to center field to give Boston a 4‚Äì0 lead. V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez got the Tribe on the board with a lead-off home run to cut the Sox lead to three. The Sox had a chance to pile on more runs in the bottom of the inning but a key double play ended the threat. The Indians threatened in the top of the third after two hits to lead off the inning but Schilling got the next three batters to work out of it. The Sox put the game away with a six-run explosion in the bottom of the inning. After two leadoff walks, Drew drove in his fifth run of the game with a single in the third inning that ended Carmona's pitching that night. Jacoby Ellsbury followed with another single off of Rafael Perez, driving in Boston's sixth run. Julio Lugo then drove a double down the third-base line to make it 8‚Äì1. After a walk, Youkilis added two more with a single compounded with a throwing error to make it 10‚Äì1. Ryan Garko started the top of the seventh with a triple and scored on a Jhonny Peralta sacrifice fly, but that would be all the offense Cleveland could muster against Schilling on the night. The Red Sox scored two more runs in the eighth off of Joe Borowski when Youkilis walked with one out, moved to third on Ortiz's double and scored on Ramirez's sacrifice fly before Lowell's RBI single scored their final run, tying the series at three games apiece. Game 7 Sunday, October 21, 2007 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts The pitching matchup for Game 7 was a rematch of Game 3, featuring Jake Westbrook for Cleveland and Japanese rookie Daisuke Matsuzaka for Boston. The Red Sox returned Cleveland's favor from Game 5 by playing \\"It Ends Tonight\\" before the game, poking fun at the Indians' untimely prediction. In the first three innings, Matsuzaka looked like the more dominant starting pitcher of the night retiring the first eight batters he faced before giving up a base hit to number-nine hitter Casey Blake; he then struck out Grady Sizemore to end the inning. Meanwhile, during those same first three innings, Westbrook gave up seven hits, one walk (intentionally), and three runs (on Manny Ramirez's RBI single in the first after two leadoff singles, Julio Lugo's double play in the second after a leadoff single and double, and Mike Lowell's sacrifice fly in the third with two on). Westbrook settled down and pitched three shutout innings, striking out four, and their offense began to take advantage of Matsuzaka putting up single runs in the top of the fourth (on Ryan Garko's RBI double after a Travis Hafner double) and fifth (on Grady Sizemore's sacrifice fly). Boston's top two relief pitchers took over after Matsuzaka's exit following the fifth inning; Hideki Okajima and Jonathan Papelbon were able to hold Indians hitters scoreless over the final four frames, giving up just four hits combined, all singles. In the seventh inning with one out and Kenny Lofton at second base, Franklin Guti√©rrez singled over the third base bag, into foul territory, with the ball ricocheting back into left field off the infamous angular foul territory fence of Fenway Park. Shortstop Julio Lugo and outfielder Manny Ramirez went after the ball. As he was about to turn toward home plate, third base coach Joel Skinner held Lofton at third. The Indians' at-bat ended when Casey Blake hit into a 5‚Äì4‚Äì3 double play. Rookies Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia were the center of the offense in the seventh with Ellsbury reaching second on a Blake error then Dustin Pedroia hit a two-run home run off of Rafael Betancourt into the Green Monster seats, giving the Red Sox some insurance runs, before they put up a six-spot in the bottom of the eighth. Lowell doubled with one out and scored on J.D. Drew's single. After a ground-rule double, intentional walk, and strikeout, a three-RBI double by Pedroia knocked Betancourt out of the game, then a two-run Kevin Youkilis home run off of Jensen Lewis made it 11‚Äì2 Red Sox, which cemented their victory and led to their second American League championship and World Series appearance in four years. This marked the third time Boston came back from a three games to one deficit in a League Championship Series. They had previously done so in 1986 and in the historic 2004 series from which they came back from a 3‚Äì0 deficit. It was a painful defeat for Cleveland, as they had blown such a big lead in games to cost them a shot at going to their first World Series in 10 years. The Indians would not return to the playoffs for the next six years.

It's so easy to lose yourself attempting to meet the expectations of others. Certainly there are practical matters that make it difficult to spend the entire day playing with Play-Doh and paste, but there are no reasons why you can't break it out on occasion. I doubt my dad realized the wheels he was setting in motion, but ultimately he began weaving the tapestry that was to become Playground Philosophy. The album's subject matter deals largely with the idea of following your path despite the nay-sayers. The exploration of Playground Philosophy was a learning experience that I will always treasure.

Clark Regional Park is an urban park located in the cities of Fullerton and Buena Park, California. The park is maintained by Orange County Regional Parks, the government division that controls the regional parks in Orange County. The park is south of Rosecrans Avenue at the southern edge of the West Coyote Hills in Buena Park, but both a small section named Camel Hill next to the main park area south of Rosecrans and another small section of the park with six softball fields and a trail located north of Rosecrans Avenue are within Fullerton city limits. The park was originally opened as Los Coyotes Regional Park in 1981, and was renamed in 1987 after then-retiring Orange County Supervisor Ralph B. Clark (1917‚Äì2009). Park facilities and activities Amphitheater, barbecues, baseball/softball fields, bicycling, fire rings, fishing, group picnic areas, hiking trails, horseshoe pits, Interpretive Center, interpretive programs, model sail boating, picnic tables, picnic shelters, playground equipment, tennis courts, volleyball courts. Interpretive center The interpretive center is a small museum which featured ice age fossil and local geology exhibits. The small but well curated museum is open Tuesday and Saturday 10am-2pm.http://www.ocparks.com/parks/ralph/interpretive OC Parks The center has an impressive mural of ice age mammals by Mark Hallet. Among the fossils on display is a 9-million-year-old baleen whale skeleton that was recovered from a local construction site. It is reputed to be one of the only complete Miocene whale fossils in existence. Trails The park has a pleasant tree shaded trail that runs about along its periphery (including a walk along the north edge of the park). The trail rises to the top of Camel Hill (located in the north east corner of the park). Sights from the top of Camel Hill include Catalina Island, the Long Beach port, Signal Hill, Palos Verdes Peninsula, the KFI radio tower, Hawks Point Bluff, Mount Baldy, the Los Coyotes Country Club, the Santa Ana Mountains and the Huntington Beach Power Plant structures. Nearby Trails The trail head for the Emery Ranch Trail lies just to the west of the portion of the park which is north of Rosecrans Avenue. This is a somewhat steep trail that winds its way up through the local coastal sage scrub plant community. The trail ends at the peak of the hill near a water storage tank. The trail head for the Castlewood Trail and the Rosecrans Trail are on the northern side of Rosecrans about east of the park entrance. These trails are part of the Fullerton loop, a popular mountain biking route. Wildlife The park has a surprising variety of wildlife, given its small size. More than 130 species of birds have been sighted in the parkBirds at Clark Regional Park and adjacent areas, compiled by Jenisch et al and there are resident populations of squirrels, rabbits, fish, lizards and turtles. In the evening, just after sundown, bats can be seen feeding on the insects that fly over the pond. On occasion coyotes, raccoons and opossums visit the park. Fishing The pond is stocked with catfish and trout. In addition, there is a resident population of Largemouth bass and bluegill. Catch and release rules apply to the bass. Fishing licenses are required for people sixteen years and older. Gallery References External links * Official Ralph B.

It was a best-of-seven series, with the West Division champion Arizona Diamondbacks facing the wild card Colorado Rockies, also from the West Division. The Rockies swept the series in four games to win their first ever pennant, extending a 17‚Äì1 run to 21‚Äì1 in the process. The Rockies won the opportunity to play the American League champion Boston Red Sox in the 2007 World Series. Colorado's NLCS sweep was only the second NLCS sweep since the seven-game format was adopted in 1985, with the first being the Atlanta Braves' sweep in 1995. The Rockies had swept the Philadelphia Phillies in three games in the NL Division Series, while the Diamondbacks had swept the Chicago Cubs. The Diamondbacks had home-field advantage due to winning the division. The series marked the first time the Rockies ever advanced to the NLCS and the second time for the Diamondbacks, in the first postseason matchup between the two teams; the Rockies' only prior postseason appearance was in 1995. It was the first time that two West Division teams had ever met in the NLCS, only the second to feature expansion franchises (the first being 1986) and the first of only two postseason meetings of any kind between teams that joined MLB in the 1990s (the other meeting being the 2017 Wild Card Game between the same two clubs). The series was telecast on TBS, the first time a League Championship Series was ever shown exclusively on a cable network. The Rockies would go on to lose in a sweep to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series in four games. Summary Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Colorado Rockies Game summaries Game 1 Thursday, October 11, 2007 at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona The Rockies took a 1‚Äì0 series lead behind a strong innings from starter Jeff Francis. Arizona scored first when Stephen Drew singled with one out in the first and scored on Eric Byrnes's RBI double, but the Rockies tied the game in the second when they loaded the bases off of Brandon Webb on two hits and a walk with no outs and Troy Tulowitzki hit into a double play that scored Todd Helton. Next inning, Willy Taveras singled with one out, stole second, and scored on Kazuo Matsui's RBI single. Matt Holliday then singled before Helton lined out to center. A wild pitch and walk loaded the bases, and Brad Hawpe's two-run single made it 4-1 Rockies. In the seventh, reliever Juan Cruz issued a leadoff walk to Yorvit Torrealba, who moved to second on a wild pitch and then to third on Francis's sacrifice bunt. After Taveras struck out, Diamondbacks first baseman Conor Jackson's fielding error on Matsui's ground ball allowed Torrealba to score to make it 5-1 Rockies. In the bottom of the inning, Francis allowed a leadoff double to Chris Snyder and hit Justin Upton with a pitch, but the Diamondbacks were taken out of a potential rally when a disputed interference call resulted in a double-play groundout for Augie Ojeda. Chase Field patrons responded by throwing objects onto the playing field, briefly stopping play. Though they loaded the bases on Jeff Cirillo's bunt single and Chris Young's walk off of reliever Matt Herges, Jeremy Affeldt got Drew to fly out to right to end the inning. Pinch hitter Miguel Montero singled with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off of Manny Corpas, but was tagged out at second to end the game. Game 2 Friday, October 12, 2007 at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona The Rockies struck first in Game 2 off of Diamondbacks' starter Doug Davis when Todd Helton reached on third baseman Mark Reynolds's ground ball fielding error, moved to third on Brad Hawpe's single two outs later, and scored on Yorvit Torrealba's single. The Diamondbacks tied it in the third when Davis hit a leadoff double off of Ubaldo Jim√©nez and scored on Chris Young's single. Willy Taveras walked to lead off the fifth off of Davis and moved to second on Kazuo Matsui's single. Matt Holliday's fly out moved the runners up one base before Helton's sacrifice fly put the Rockies up 2-1. In the bottom of the ninth, Manny Corpas hit Young with a pitch with one out and subsequently allowed a single to Stephen Drew. Eric Byrnes grounded to third baseman Matsui, who made an errant throw to second, allowing Young to score and tie the game, but unaware of this, Drew wandered off second base, allowing shortstop Troy Tulowitzski to tag him out at third. Tony Clark grounded out to send the game into extra innings. Jose Valverde retired the Rockies in order in the 10th, but in the 11th, allowed a single and two walks to load the bases with two outs before walking Taveras to put the Rockies up 3-2. Doug Slaten in relief got Matsui to line out to right to end the inning, but Ryan Speier, in relief of Corpas, retired the Diamondbacks in order in the bottom of the inning to end the game and put the Rockies up 2-0 in the series shifting to Coors Field. Game 3 Sunday, October 14, 2007 at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado The Rockies moved to within one win of the World Series for the first time in franchise history by winning Game 3 by a score of 4‚Äì1. Matt Holliday gave them a 1‚Äì0 lead in the first with a two-out solo home run off Arizona starter Liv√°n Hern√°ndez, but Mark Reynolds tied the game in the fourth with a tape measure home run to left off of Josh Fogg. The decisive blow was delivered in the bottom of the sixth when Yorvit Torrealba battled in an eight-pitch at-bat to drive a three-run home run to left field off of Hernandez that sent Coors Field into a frenzy. Memorably, Torrealba pumped his fist in the air while rounding second base. The Rockies now held a 3‚Äì0 lead in the series. Despite them eventually sweeping Arizona, this was the only game where they outhit them. Game 4 Monday, October 15, 2007 at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado The Rockies won their first pennant in franchise history with a 6‚Äì4 win in Game 4, completing a sweep of the number one seed Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks struck first when Micah Owings singled to lead off the third off of starter Franklin Morales, moved to second two outs later on a walk, and scored on Conor Jackson's single. The Rockies struck back with a six-run fourth inning. Owings walked Brad Hawpe and Troy Tulowitzski with one out. Yorvit Torrealba's ground out moved them one base each before pinch hitter Seth Smith's two-run bloop double down the left-field line one out later put the Rockies up 2-1. Arizona first baseman Jackson's fielding error allowed Willy Taveras to reach base and move Smith to third. Kazuo Matsui's single scored Smith before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday's three-run home run to deep center put the Rockies up 6-1. Juan Cruz and Brandon Lyon held them hitless for the rest of the game. Brian Fuentes allowed a leadoff single to Stephen Drew in the eighth, then another single to Jackson one out later before Chris Snyder cut the Rockies lead to 6-4 with a two-out, three-run home run to left that stayed just fair. After Justin Upton tripled, Manny Corpas then came on and struck out Tony Clark to end the inning. Corpas allowed a one-out double to Young in the ninth, but got Drew to pop out to second and Eric Byrnes, the center of controversy before Game 3, to hit a check-swing roller to Troy Tulowitzki, who fired to Todd Helton at first to retire the diving Byrnes and send Colorado to the 2007 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. No team had ever swept their way to the World Series since the Division Series began in 1995. Colorado was also the first team to have a 7‚Äì0 start to a postseason since the 1976 Cincinnati Reds finished the playoffs 7‚Äì0 sweeping both the LCS and World Series.

He was the grandson, on his mother's side, of Isaiah (ben Mali) di Trani the Elder. He is usually quoted as ◊®◊ô◊ê\\"◊ñ (= \\"R. Isaiah A·∏•aron, ◊ñ\\"◊ú\\"), or (◊®◊ô◊ë\\"◊ê = \\"R.

Works  He wrote commentaries on the books of Joshua,Leipsic, 1712 Judges and Samuel,Printed in Mikraot Gedolot KingsI Kings 4:4,5,19, and 5:17 only being included in the principal editions of Mikraot Gedolot and Job.printed in J.

Nos. 217‚Äì218, in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, contain commentaries by him on the prophetical books and on Psalms; the Rome MSS. contain a commentary on the five Megillot.Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. ix. 137 The last-named are sometimes ascribed to his grandfather, but G√ºdemann advances several reasons in support of Isaiah ben Elijah's authorship, the principal being their identity of style with Isaiah's acknowledged commentaries.Berliner's Magazin, i. 45 et seq. Isaiah's commentaries are confined to simple, concise, and rational exegesis. Their importance lies in the fact that they were the first to be issued in Italy that were free from allegorical interpretations. In them he quotes the Spanish grammarians Ibn Jana·∏•, Ibn ·∏§ayyuj, and Abraham ibn Ezra. More important, however, is his Pirkei Halakhot,Halberstam MSS. and other incomplete MSS.; Paris MSS. Nos. 395, 396; Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. Nos. 643-650; Parma, De Rossi, MSS. Nos. 793, 934 a ritual code, the first produced in Italy. Extracts from it are printed in Joshua Boas's Shil·π≠e ha- Gibborim, Sabbionetta, 1554, and in the editions of Isaac Alfasi's Halakhot. On the basis of the Talmudical treatises and following their sequence the Halakot are derived from the Mishnah rather than from the Gemara, and are clearly arranged in a precise way. The author ascribes great authority to the Jerusalem Talmud. He is independent in his criticisms of older authorities, his grandfather not excepted, whom he often quotes (with the abbreviation ◊û◊ñ\\"◊î = \\"Mori Ze·∏≥eni ha-Rav\\"). As a sort of preliminary work to the Halakhot he wrote a book, Kontres ha-Re'ayot, which contained and discussed the proofs for his halakic decisions. Isaiah also wrote a Tachanun prayer.Zunz, Literaturgesch. p. 363 Two other prayers, signed merely \\"Isaiah\\", may be ascribed to him or to his grandfather, who also was a liturgical poet.See Landshuth, Ammudei haAvodah, p. 134 Unlike his grandfather, Isaiah was an opponent of Aristotle and of the rest of the Greek philosophers who \\"denied the Torah.\\" Religious conceptions are, according to him, a matter of tradition more than of individual meditation. He advised against religious disputations with the Gentiles and against teaching them the Torah. He endeavored to shield the grotesque midrashim from derision on the part of Christian theologians and baptized Jews by interpreting them as symbolic or hyperbolic.

He is currently working as a goalkeeping coach for the youth teams of AGF. He played 54 games in the Danish Superliga championship from 2003 to 2010, representing FC Midtjylland, Viborg FF, and AGF. He had good reaction skills, but was insecure in the air. Biography Rasmussen started his career in the Danish club Aarhus Gymnastik Forening (AGF) in 1997, playing in the secondary Danish 1st Division. He stayed two years with AGF, but did not get on the pitch for the club. He moved on to league rivals AC Horsens in 1999. In 2001, Rasmussen was brought to FC Midtjylland (FCM) in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship. He was initially a reserve for Danish international goalkeeper Peter Skov-Jensen. Rasmussen did not get a chance for an extended run in the team, before FCM sold Peter Skov-Jensen in January 2005. After the sale, Rasmussen became the first choice goalkeeper, and helped FCM win bronze medals in the 2004‚Äì05 Superliga season. For the 2005‚Äì06 season, Rasmussen was in contention with Swedish goalkeeper Ola Tidman, and Rasmussen eventually won a place in the starting line-up. In the first half of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Rasmussen played 13 of FCM's first 18 games. In January 2007, FCM bought Czech goalkeeper Martin Ra≈°ka, to be the new first choice keeper. Rasmussen wanted to secure a move away from FCM, and tried to get a contract with the Norwegian club Fredrikstad FK. He did not succeed, and returned to FCM, where he found himself surpassed by Martin Ra≈°ka and the ten years younger Lasse Heinze. Rasmussen moved on to Superliga club Viborg FF, playing there for two years. He moved back to AGF in January 2009, as the second- choice keeper behind Steffen Rasmussen.http://www.agf.dk/agf- fodbold/nyhedsarkiv/2009/1-kvartal/rutineret-maalmand-til-agf/ He played three games in the 2009-10 Danish Superliga season.http://www.danskfodbold.com/spiller.php?ligaid=2001&spillerid;=10213 In February 2011, Rasmussen was given the position of goalkeeping coach for the AGF youth teams.

Racing at age three in 1948, he was overshadowed by stablemate Citation, finishing second to him in the Kentucky Derby. Citation became the 8th U.S. Triple Crown Champion. Coaltown, meanwhile, won eight of his thirteen starts. He won the Blue Grass Stakes in track record time and at the end of the year was voted 1948's U.S. Champion Sprint Horse. In 1949, injuries kept Citation from racing, allowing Coaltown to show how good he really was. He won twelve of his fifteen races, and set or matched several U.S. and world records including: # A new world record for the mile at Washington Park Race Track in the Whirlaway Stakes. # Equaled the world record and set a new track record for 1 miles at Gulfstream Park # Equaled the world record and set a new track record for 1 miles at Hialeah Park # Set a new track record for 1 miles at Arlington Park # Equaled the track record for six furlongs at Hollywood Park Racetrack In his final race of 1949, Coaltown was a badly beaten 2nd to 1949 arch-rival Capot in the Pimlico Special. Nonetheless, his performances that year earned him Handicap Horse of the Year honors. He was voted United States Horse of the Year in a nationwide poll in which he defeated Capot by 102 votes to 71. Capot had earlier been named Horse of the Year by the Daily Racing Form. After mediocre performances in 1950 and '51, Coaltown was retired to stud at Calumet Farm, where he had only limited success as a sire. In 1955, he was sold to Haras de Jardy in Marnes-la- Coquette, France where he died at the age of 20 in 1965.

Now, one has the necessary information for a preliminary determination of which states have abnormally tall or short men by comparing the means of each state to the grand mean ¬± some multiple of the standard deviation. In ANOVA, there is a similar usage of grand mean to calculate sum of squares (SSQ), a measurement of variation. The total variation is defined as the sum of squared differences between each score and the grand mean (designated as GM), given by the equation :SSQ_{total} = \\\\sum (X-GM)^2  Discussion  The term grand mean is used for two different concepts that should not be confused, namely, the overall mean and the mean of means. The overall mean (in a grouped data set) is equal to the sample mean, namely, \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ig}. The mean of means is literally the mean of the G (g=1,...,G) group means \\\\bar{x}_g, namely, \\\\frac{1}{G}\\\\sum_{g=1}^G \\\\bar{x}_g. If the sample sizes across the G groups are equal, then the two statistics coincide.

Russian Ambassador Mikhail Nikolaevich Giers initiated the building of a Russian Orthodox church in central Bucharest in 1905. It was meant mainly for the use of the legation employees, as well as for Russians living in the capital city of the Kingdom of Romania. The Court of Emperor Nicholas II provided the funds needed for the building (600,000 gold rubles). The structure occupies a surface of 350 m2 and it was set in brick and stone. The seven domes (taking the shape of onion domes -- characteristic of Russia, but unusual in Romania) were initially covered in gold. The iconostasis was carved in wood and then covered in gold, following the model of Church of the Twelve Apostles in the Moscow Kremlin. The church was finished in 1909, and it was sanctified on November 25, 1909. During World War I, just before the start of the occupation of Bucharest by the Central Powers, it was closed, while all valuables and the archives were transported to Ia≈üi and then farther to Saint Petersburg, where they vanished during the Russian Revolution of 1917. After the war, physical damage was repaired by the Russian community in Bucharest, with services starting again in 1921. As the service was held in Old Church Slavonic, it was also attended by ethnic Bulgarians and Serbs in the Romanian capital. As the old Russian priest had died, in 1935 the church was transferred under the authority of the Romanian Government, which meant it for the use of the students and professors at the University of Bucharest. In 1947, at the request of Soviet authorities, the church passed once again under the Patriarchate of Moscow, which named a new Russian priest, also providing the funds for its refurbishment. In 1957 Patriarch Alexius I decided to pass it again to the Romanian Orthodox Church, which had it restored once again. It was sanctified again in 1967 and in 1992 it was again given for the use of the students and professors at the University of Bucharest. Because of its present congregation it is also known as Biserica studen≈£ilor (\\"The students' church\\"). On 25 November 1909 St. Nicholas Church remained under the jurisdiction of the Russian Patriarchate until 1934, when Nicolae Titulescu, at that time the head of the Romanian diplomacy, obtained it to be given to the administration of the University of Bucharest. On May 5, 1947, the retreat came under the jurisdiction of Moscow until 1957 when it again became the property of the Romanian Orthodoxy, having the status of the church of exaltation. In 1947, Pavel Statov, a representative of the Moscow Patriarchate, was repaired and the painting was renovated in 1948 by the painter Anatolie Cudinov, and the repairs in 1967 by the painters Eugen Profeta, Victor Zenlichika and Victor Kostyurin. After the 1977 earthquake, the great tower was cracked, consolidating the entire edifice and reconditioning the painting. Work began in 2000, being a time-lag due to lack of funds. In 1992, the Blessed Teoctist Father, Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, attributed to the students the Church of Saint Nicholas (formerly the Russian Church), who thus regains, after 45 years, the Paraclis of the University of Bucharest. Thus, with care and parental love, students welcomed the strong desire to have a church dedicated to missionary work in the student environment.

The characters were inspired by the superhero Batman to fight crime in their respective countries. The group first appeared in Detective Comics #215. Later the Batmen of All Nations were renamed the International Club of Heroes, often known as just the Club of Heroes. Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths, they were named the Dome (see Global Guardians) and were not inspired by Batman but the Justice Society of America. Grant Morrison featured them in his 2007 run on Batman (#667-669). Morrison revealed the modern period fates of the \\"Club of Heroes\\". Organization history In the 1950s, the legend of the Batman had reached the whole world. Many people in other countries were inspired by this to become superheroes themselves. Years later, Batman decided to hold the first meeting with his counterparts in Gotham City. First, in Batman #56, Batman trained Bat-Hombre at the request of a South American president but he turned out to be a member of an outlaw band. Batman took the identity himself and the original Bat- Hombre was killed fighting him. In Batman #62, he met the Knight and the Squire in England. In Batman #65, he trained Wingman. In Batman #86, he met the Sioux Man-of-Bats and his son Little Raven. In Detective Comics #215, Batman invites the Knight and Squire, the Musketeer, the Gaucho, the Ranger, and the Legionary. In World's Finest Comics #89, philanthropist John Mayhew invites Batman and Robin, Superman, the Legionary, the Musketeer, the Gaucho, and the Knight and the Squire to award them membership in his Club of Heroes. The Knight and Squire then joined the Ultramarine Corps in JLA #26 and had an adventure with them in JLA Classified #1-3. Recent history right A three-issue story arc in Batman #667-669, written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by J. H. Williams III, shows what has become of the Batmen of All Nations. * The Knight, a.k.a. Cyril Sheldrake, Earl of Wordenshire, is the adult Squire, having taken up his father's mantle after the original Knight was killed by Spring-heeled Jack, who forced him to swallow a small explosive. As the Squire, Cyril sunk into a depression following his father's death, spending his father's fortune and ending up in the gutter until given help by a young lady named Beryl Hutchinson and her mother. Upon becoming the new Knight, Cyril has appointed Beryl as his Squire. The new Knight is made to suffer a similar fate to his father by John Mayhew, but Man-of-Bats operates on him and removes the explosive before it detonates. * The Musketeer was sent to an asylum after he accidentally killed a man in battle. After he was released, he wrote a book about the experience, sold off its movie rights, and became rich. Bilal Asselah, a Sunni Muslim and expert parkour exponent who assumes the identity of Nightrunner, was eventually chosen as Batman Inc.'s representative in Paris, France. * Native American Man-Of-Bats and his son Little Raven, who has grown up and changed his name to Raven Red, have a strained relationship. Man-of-Bats has some medical expertise. Raven Red almost dies at the hands of John Mayhew but is saved by his father, Robin, and the Squire. They later join Batman Incorporated. In that series, they are given names (Dr. Bill Great Eagle and Charlie Great Eagle) and Man-of-Bats is said to have fought in Iraq; the two of them protect and aid an Indian reservation in South Dakota where their identities are publicly known.Batman Incorporated #7 * Wingman has changed his look and resembles Batman even more than he originally did. He refuses to admit he worked with Batman and claims he came up with his superhero identity a year before Batman debuted. With his accomplice, billionaire John Mayhew, he kills the Ranger and tries to kill the others. He is later killed by John Mayhew. In Batman Incorporated a new Wingman is shown with his identity a mystery, who is later revealed to be Jason Todd in 2012's Batman Inc. #4. * El Gaucho has become a serious superhero in Argentina and has changed his look. He is wounded in action but manages to apprehend the traitorous Wingman with one of his trademark boleadoras, saving the life of Batman. He is shown becoming a new member of Batman Incorporated; in the series, he is given a civilian identity as horse- breeder and playboy Santiago Vargas; and a history as a secret agent for the UN spy agency Spyral, where he worked with the first Batwoman and for the villainous Dr. Dedalus.Batman Incorporated #3-4 * The Ranger changes his costume and methods in order to keep up with the increasingly violent villain community. Now calling himself the Dark Ranger, he wields a jetpack and a pulse weapon. He is killed by Wingman, who then steals his identity. Following this, his former sidekick, the Scout, has taken up the mantle as the new Dark Ranger.Batman #681 The new Dark Ranger that used to be Scout is Johnny Riley, an aboriginal tattoo artist in Melbourne's St. Kilda.Batman Incorporated: The Deluxe Edition; Paperwork section * The Legionary has not maintained his physique and loves to reminisce on his past as a superhero. He is stabbed twenty-three times (√† la Caesar) by John Mayhew. In the arc, the group was reunited on John Mayhew's island resort in the Caribbean. The heroes were confronted with a disturbing video showing Dr. Hurt (see below), purportedly wearing the severed skin of Mayhew over his face. On behalf of the Black Glove organization, he challenges the club as representatives of 'good' against his 'evil', destroying their means of transport and threatening to kill them all. The various members of the club are killed or injured in the styles of their various archenemies, causing some to suspect that a 'Club of Villains' has been assembled. In a traumatic flashback, the Knight reveals the reason that the Club originally disbanded and never succeeded as an international superteam; after losing Batman's commitment, the Club was brought down by scandal when the original Knight discovered that Mayhew had killed his wife and framed Mangrove Pierce, an actor with whom she had been having an affair, for her death. Cast out of the team for his accusations, the Knight lost focus and was murdered by Spring-Heeled Jack; the other heroes went their separate ways, their faith in Mayhew and the team as a whole similarly shattered. Batman, the Gaucho, and Dark Ranger appear to be the last ones left alive, but Batman realizes that Dark Ranger is in fact Wingman, having swapped suits with the real Ranger and faked his own death. Wingman has been working in concert with the sadistic Mayhew to do the bidding of the Black Glove, having always been jealous of Batman's prowess. Despite injuring the Gaucho, Wingman is defeated by the Argentinean hero and Batman and executed by the Gaucho's archenemy, El Sombrero. As El Sombrero escapes the island, Batman follows him to unmask him as an impostor, none other than John Mayhew, whose death was also faked by the Black Glove (Dr. Hurt was later to claim that the skin used in the video was that of Mangrove Pierce, who was the star of The Black Glove, a film which Mayhew produced and directed). Mayhew reveals his motivation behind joining the Black Glove and gambling with lives is his boredom at being an aimless socialite; he appears to escape via an ejector seat, leaving his helicopter for Batman to use to rescue the survivors of the Club of Heroes. Mayhew is summarily killed by the Black Glove in the destruction of his island, having foolishly bet that 'evil' would win against 'good'. Members * Batman and his sidekick Robin (United States) * Man-Of-Bats and his sidekick Little Raven (USA‚ÄìSioux Indian) * El Gaucho (Argentina) * The Knight and his sidekick the Squire (England) * The Musketeer (later replaced by the Nightrunner) (France) * The Legionary (Italy) * The Ranger (later the Dark Ranger) and his sidekick the Scout (Australia) * Wingman (Sweden) Club of Villains In the storyline \\"Batman R.I.P.\\", the Batman family fights against the Club of Villains, a counter-group specifically built by the Black Glove Organization to destroy Batman, followed by the remaining Club of Heroes members. The Club was composed of: * Dr. Simon Hurt: A deranged psychiatrist heading the Black Glove to destroy Batman, body and soul. He claims to be Thomas Wayne and wears the Bat-suit that Bruce's father once wore to a costume party; later, Batman accuses him of being Mangrove Pierce, an actor who was framed for murder by John Mayhew. Hurt denied this, stating that he had skinned Pierce alive and worn \\"him to Mayhew's party\\", which probably refers to the events of Batman #667‚Äì669 (see above). From Batman's final entry in his Black Casebook (see Batman #681), it is implied that Hurt is, in fact, the Devil, as others had previously claimed. * Le Bossu (Guy Dax): A French villain dressed as a hunchback, with henchmen dressed as gargoyles, whose real identity is brilliant neurosurgeon and 'family man' Guy Dax. He uses the Bossu identity to indulge his violent fantasies. He is shown to admire the Joker until the latter disfigured him with a razor. He sees his disfigurement as an opportunity to give up his old life and become a sadistic monster permanently. * Pierrot Lunaire: A foe of the Musketeer who dresses as the Commedia dell'arte character Pierrot. Owing to the tradition of mimes, he never speaks.Batman #668 * King Kraken: A masked deep sea diver whose weapon of choice is a high voltage electric rifle. A foe of Wingman. He believes that \\"henchmen are for wussies\\".Batman #669 * Charlie Caligula: A madman whose schemes are inspired by Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. A foe of the Legionary. He was briefly tortured and left for dead by Batman while the crimefighter was in his \\"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh\\" persona. * El Sombrero: Archenemy of El Gaucho, a lunatic in a luchador mask who designs deathtraps for anyone who is willing to pay. John Mayhew posed as him in order to attempt at escaping culpability for his crimes shortly before the Black Glove executed him. The real Sombrero was believed to be murdered by the Joker, but was later revealed to be alive in Batman, Inc. * Jezebel Jet: A wealthy woman of African descent who had lost her parents. She is said to own an African province. Pretended to be in love with Batman, though Batman told her to thank Alfred for his acting lessons when the topic was brought up between the two. * Scorpiana: A sultry assassin who uses a blue scorpion as her calling card. A foe of El Gaucho. * Swagman: A gunman who speaks in an Australian accent and wears a costume based on the clothes of Australian bandit Ned Kelly. An enemy of Dark Ranger. * The Joker was briefly recruited by the Club as the ma√Ætre for Batman's danse macabre. Other versions Kingdom Come A different version of the Batmen of All Nations appears in the critically acclaimed Kingdom Come comic series. The members of this group include \\"Cossack, the Champion of Russia\\", \\"Samurai, the Champion of Japan\\", and \\"Dragon, the Champion of China\\". They were joined by \\"Batwoman, a Batman admirer from the Fourth World\\". International Delegation of Masked Archers The International Delegation of Masked Archers (also known as The Green Arrows Of The World) were a similar group based on Green Arrow rather than Batman. They appeared in Adventure Comics #250 (July 1958), in a story very similar to the Detective Comics story that introduced the Batmen of All Nations. The members included: * Ace Archer (Japan) * Bowman of Britain (United Kingdom) * Bowman of the Bush (Africa) * Green Arrow (America) * Phantom (France) * Unnamed Green Arrows of Austria, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Spain International Sea Devils The International Sea Devils were a similar group based on a team known as the Sea Devils. * Miguel (South America) * Molo (Africa) * Sikki (India) In other media The Club of Villains are featured in a cameo appearance in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Knights of Tomorrow!\\". Pierrot Lunaire, El Sombrero, Swagman, King Kraken, Charlie Caligula, and Scorpiana all appear as part of montage showcasing villains that were defeated by the future Batman and Robin. The Batmen of All Nations appear in the episode \\"Powerless\\" with Musketeer voiced by Diedrich Bader, El Gaucho voiced by Jeff Bennett, and Legionnaire voiced by John DiMaggio. The Batmen of All Nations featured are El Gaucho, Musketeer, Knight, Legionnaire, Ranger, and Wingman. Additionally, a previously unseen black Batman from South Africa (who resembles Impala) was also seen as part of the team. They faced another counter-group formed by The Joker called \\"The Jokers of All Nations\\" (made up of an Inuit, a Canadian Hockey player, a Scotsman, a Cossack, and a Sumo wrestler, all unnamed and Jokerized). The Batmen of All Nations fight The Jokers of All Nations and managed to defeat them.

It is separated from the city of Boston by the Neponset River, and borders the Quincy neighborhoods of Squantum, Montclair and Wollaston. It contains the smaller neighborhoods of Atlantic (sometimes used as a metonym for North Quincy) and Norfolk Downs, as well as much of Wollaston Beach.  History  Originally referred to as Billings Plain, the area - once largely marshland and part of the Neponset River drainage - was utilized as training and parade grounds by local militia. It was subsequently home to a race track operated by the Jockey Club of Boston in the 19th century.http://www.quincyma.gov/Living/neighborhoods.cfm Starting in the late 1970s, North Quincy has seen a large influx of Chinese American and Eastern Asian immigrants and is predominantly Asian today. The neighborhood was once home to a large Navy population, housed in a large development north of Quincy Shore Drive and intended to serve the Squantum naval air base. After NAS Squantum closed, the site continued to house Navy personnel and their families based at the South Weymouth NAS until that base's closure in 1997; it has since been converted to senior housing. The major employers in the neighborhood are Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and State Street Corporation, which have their operations centers on Newport Avenue adjacent to the rapid transit station.  Transportation  North Quincy MBTA station Starting in 1845, the Old Colony Railroad began servicing the area. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the system - which extended through the South Shore, Norfolk and Plymouth Counties - starting in 1893. The neighborhood had two Old Colony stations; the Norfolk Downs station, situated at the end of Billings Road, and Atlantic Station, at the end of Atlantic Street. The Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway ran streetcar routes from Neponset Station in Boston along Hancock Street to Quincy Center and points south through the 1930s; a branch route went from Atlantic Station to Squantum.Derrah, p.44. The North Quincy station of the MBTA's Red Line, situated across from North Quincy High School on Hancock and West Squantum Streets, opened in 1971. Several MBTA bus routes also serve the neighborhood; the 211 Squantum-Montclair route passes through North Quincy Station down East Squantum Street to Squantum, the 210 Quincy Center-Fields Corner route travels down Hancock Street and the 212 North Quincy-Quincy Center route travels down Billings Road. State Route 3A traverses the length of Hancock Street, crossing the Neponset River Bridge into Boston.  Education  Quincy Elementary School The public schools serving North Quincy are F. W. Parker Elementary School and Atlantic Middle School. A second elementary school, Quincy Elementary School on Newbury Avenue, was closed in 1981 following the passage of Proposition 2¬Ω and converted to condominiums; the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. North Quincy High School, between Hancock and Hunt Streets, is the high school of North Quincy and the surrounding neighborhoods. It underwent extensive renovation in 1970-72, expanding significantly and requiring the razing of Oliver Street.Quincy, Mass. Historical and Architectural Survey A since-closed annex was also built on Newbury Avenue.

The term can also refer to a scale on a psychometric test, or a type of adult in attachment theory psychology. The fear of intimacy is the fear of being emotionally and/or physically close to another individual. This fear is also defined as \\"the inhibited capacity of an individual, because of anxiety, to exchange thought and feelings of personal significance with another individual who is highly valued\\".Descutner, Carol J., Thelen, Mark H. \\"Development and Validation of a Fear-of-Intimacy Scale\\". P 219 Fear of intimacy is the expression of existential views in that to love and to be loved makes life seem precious and death more inevitable.Firestone, Robert W. and Catlett, Joyce. Fear of Intimacy. p. 5 It can result from any number of dysfunctional bonding experiences ranging from early childhood parental attachments to relationship failures in adulthood.  Symptoms  People with this fear are anxious about or afraid of intimate relationships. They believe that they do not deserve love or support from others.Kim Bartholomew. \\"Avoidance of Intimacy: An Attachment Perspective.\\" P. 147 Fear of intimacy has three defining features: content which represents the ability to communicate personal information, emotional valence which refers to the feelings about personal information exchanged, and vulnerability signifying their regard for the person they are intimate with. Bartholomew and Horowitz go further and determine four different adult attachment types: \\"(1) Secure individuals have a sense of worthiness or lovability and are comfortable with intimacy and autonomy; (2) preoccupied persons lack this sense of self-worthiness yet view others positively and seek their love and acceptance; (3) fearful people lack a sense of lovability and are avoidant of others in anticipation of rejection; (4) dismissing persons feel worthy of love yet detach from others whom they generally regard as untrustworthy\\".Bartholomew, K., & Horowitz, L. M. \\"Attachment style among young adults: A test of a four-category model\\"  Fear of Intimacy Scale  The Fear of Intimacy Scale (FIS) is a 35-item self- evaluation that can determine the level of fear of intimacy that an individual has. This test can determine this level even if the individual is not in a relationship. It was found by Doi and Thelen that FIS correlated positively with confidence in the dependability of others and fear of abandonment while correlating negatively with comfort and closeness.Alperin, Richard M. \\"Barriers to Intimacy: An Object Relations Perspective\\" A high score represents a high level of fear of intimacy.  Among women  A study conducted by Reis and Grenyer found that women with depression have much higher levels of fear of intimacy.Mark H. Thelen, Michelle D. Sherman and Tiffany S. Borst. \\"Fear of Intimacy and Attachment among Rape Survivors.\\" P. 114 Another study found that fear of intimacy among women might be strongly associated with actual intimacy instead of desired intimacy.Bumby, Kurt M.; Hanseny, David J.. \\"Intimacy Deficits, Fear of Intimacy, and Loneliness Among Sexual Offenders.\\" This study also found that the level of the woman's fear of intimacy is a good indicator of the longevity of a couple's relationship.Mark H. Thelen, Jillon S. Vander Wal, Ann Muir Thomas and Robert Harmon. \\"Fear of Intimacy among Dating Couples.\\" Another study determined that women who fear intimacy generally perceive less intimacy in their dating relationships even if their partner does not have this fear. This study also found that fear of intimacy in women plays a key role in the intimacy of the relationship and in the relationship's likelihood of survival. Also, it was determined that \\"[fe]males who were taught not to trust strangers consistently experienced greater fear of intimacy and more loneliness than did those who were not trained to distrust strangers\\".Von Drashek, Susan R.; Terrell, Francis; Terrell, Ivanna S. \\"Loneliness and Fear of Intimacy Among Adolescents Who Were Taught Not to Trust Strangers During Childhood\\"  Among abused women  Mark H. Thelen, Michelle D. Sherman and Tiffany S. Borst conducted a study in 1998 \\"to determine if rape survivors have difficulties with attachment and fear of intimacy\\". In the study, they used the FIS and other methods to compare rape survivors with other non-abused controls. When trait anxiety was ruled out, it was found that there was \\"no significant differences on fear of intimacy, confidence in others' dependability, and comfort with closeness\\". The results of this study showed that \\"Confidence in others' dependability and comfort with closeness were negatively correlated with the FIS whereas fear of abandonment was not correlated with the FIS. ‚Ä¶The attachment dimensions and the FIS were significantly correlated in the predicted direction with trait anxiety\\". The results of this study showed that \\"the rape survivors differed from the controls in reporting higher fear of intimacy‚Ä¶ suggesting that the experience of rape is related to women's discomfort in close relationships\\". It was also found that \\"those who disclosed the rape did not differ significantly from those who did not disclose on fear of intimacy or the attachment measures, although the differences were in the predicted direction\\". Another study found that \\"abused women exhibited significantly higher levels of externalized self-sacrifice, silence, and disconnection intimate relationships when compared to nonabused women\\". They also found that the challenge of trying to help these women \\"are magnified when working with battered women because of the betrayal of trust they have experienced within interpersonal relationships\\".Woods, Stephanie J. \\"Normative Beliefs Regarding the Maintenance of Intimate Relationships Among Abused and Nonabused Women\\"  Childhood sexual abuse victims  \\"CSA patients have... an extreme fear of allowing others to see them as they truly are\\". They have a high \\"fear of being revictimized as a consequence of being trusting and open to someone in authority\\".Farber, Barry A., Khurgin-Bott, Rachel, Feldman, Sarah. \\"The Benefits and Risks of Patient Self-Disclosure in the Psychotherapy of Women with a History of Childhood Sexual Abuse.\\" Because of their experience, \\"intimacy feels...very frightening to most CSA survivors... To feel close to another again is to remember that this position is a dangerous one, one that might lead to being taken advantage of\\".  Among child molesters and abusers Current studies show that people who have an insufficient amount of intimacy or are lonely are more vulnerable to exhibit sexually offending behaviors. One recent study determined that child molesters exhibited significantly higher levels of fear of intimacy than rapists, nonsexually abusing inmates, and a control group of law-abiding citizens.Reis S, Grenyer BF. \\"Fear of Intimacy in Women: Relationship between Attachment Styles and Depressive Symptoms\\" It was also found that \\"men with attachment anxiety would have a different goal in a conflict: to stay connected, which may temper the use of severe violence but not mild violence and psychological abuse\\".Mark H. Thelen, Michelle D. Sherman and Tiffany S. Borst. \\"Fear of Intimacy and Attachment among Rape Survivors.\\" P. 115  Intimacy anxiety disorder  Intimacy anxiety disorder is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by an intense anxiety or fear in one or more intimate (sexual) or partner- social interactions, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. Examples of sexual interaction are kissing, sexual touching, and sexual intercourse. The cognitions behind the intense anxiety include fears of being incompetent, of making mistakes, of being judged on how they carry out sexual interactions, causing harm, or being harmed during sexual interaction. Examples of partner-social interactions are talking to a romantic interest, asking/going on a dinner date, hugging, holding hands, and kissing. The cognition behind the anxiety is about being afraid of making mistakes, being incompetent, failing, or being judged on how they carry out partner-social interactions. In order to meet the criteria for intimacy anxiety disorder, either high anxiety in partner-social interactions and/or high anxiety in sexual interactions are present.

Epiphyllum anguliger), commonly known as the fishbone cactus or zig zag cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. The species is commonly grown as an ornamental for its fragrant flowers in the fall. Taxonomy and etymology This species was formerly placed in the genus Epiphyllum as Epiphyllum anguliger. However, according to recent molecular research, it is actually a species of Disocactus. The specific name derives from the deeply toothed stems (\\"anguliger\\" = \\"angle bearing\\"). Description This epiphytic cactus has smooth green skin and extensively branched stems. The primary stems are often woody. Secondary stems are flat and succulent, 20‚Äì30 cm long, 3‚Äì5 cm wide, and deeply lobed. The lobes are rectangular or slightly rounded. The white or pale yellow flowers bloom nocturnally, exuding a strong, sweet scent; they are 6‚Äì20 cm long and 6‚Äì7 cm wide. The fruit, 3‚Äì4 cm thick, are ovoid and brownish, greenish or yellowish. The interior of the fruit is reminiscent of kiwifruit, with green pulp and small black seeds. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to Mexico, occurring as an epiphyte in evergreen forests in Guerrero, Jalisco, Nayarit and Oaxaca. It can be found at elevations between 1,100 and 1,800 m. This plant was first distributed by the Horticultural Society of London which obtained it from the collector T. Hartweg in 1846. Cultivation This easily cultivated, fast growing epiphyte requires a compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. It should be kept at , but temperatures may drop to for shorter periods. It is best grown in semi-shade. It flowers in late autumn or early winter. Cultivars and hybrids There are a large number of cultivars and hybrids in existence with more added each year, just a few are listed here. * E. anguliger 'El Tecolote' WC (REDC) 1997.

He was recognised as one of the most wide-ranging of global historians. While his middle name came from one of British imperialism's greatest heroes, General 'Chinese' Gordon of Khartoum, he emerged as one of Britain's foremost ideological warriors against empire. Life Born in Ashton-on-Mersey, a southern district of Manchester, Kiernan was one of three children born to Ella n√©e Young and John Edward Kiernan, who served as a translator of Spanish and Portuguese for the privately owned Manchester Ship Canal. His family came from a congregationalist, non-conformist religious tradition that he later suggested played a role in his socialist formation and that of many of the Communist Party Historians Group founded in 1946. A scholarship student at the Manchester Grammar School, Kiernan developed a passion for the classics, as he added ancient Greek and Latin to the modern European languages he had already learned at home. Propelled with three new scholarships, he went on to Trinity College, Cambridge where he achieved a double-starred First in History (B.A.,1934; M.A., 1937). Recruited by Guy Burgess during a time of radical ferment among Cambridge students, Kiernan joined the Communist Party in 1934. He found his radicalism subsequently reinforced by what he regarded as the treachery of Britain's elites. Perhaps the greatest influence on Kiernan was Maurice Dobb. A lecturer in economics at Cambridge, he had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920 and was open with his students about his communist beliefs. Kiernan later wrote: \\"We had no time then to assimilate Marxist theory more than very roughly; it was only beginning to take root in England, although it had one remarkable expounder at Cambridge in Maurice Dobb.\\" In 1938, as a junior fellow, Kiernan departed for Bombay in to continue his political activities and to teach at the Sikh National College and Aitchison College in Lahore, India (now Pakistan). Shortly after his arrival he married the theatre activist and childhood friend of Indira Nehru, Shanta Gandhi. Though they remained friends, they split up when Kiernan returned to Cambridge in 1946 to complete his Fellowship. Spurned by both Cambridge and Oxford, Kiernan was offered a lectureship in 1948 at the University of Edinburgh, thanks to the intervention of the distinguished historian Richard Pares. In 1970, Kiernan was given a Personal Chair in Modern History; a position he held until his retirement in 1977. Having joined the CPGB in 1934, he finally left in 1959, chiefly in disgust at the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, after which, he said: \\"I waited in hopes the party might improve. It didn't.\\" In 1993 at the age of 80, Kiernan produced Shakespeare: Poet and Citizen a book he had been working on since 1947. A second volume, Eight Tragedies of Shakespeare, followed in 1996. His final book, Horace: Poetics and Politics appeared in 1999. Kiernan died peacefully in his sleep, aged 95, in Stow, Scotland. Intellectual legacy Kiernan made immense contributions to the post-war flowering of British Marxist historiography that transformed the understanding of social history. Seeking escape paths from a congealing Stalinism, this intellectual movement grew from several figures among them - E.P. Thompson, Christopher Hill, Rodney Hilton, Kiernan and Eric Hobsbawm. Brash and confident in wielding the best of the British Left's cultural arsenal, they welcomed open-ended dialogue with non- Marxist traditions. Some of this dialogue was on display in the journal Past & Present, a journal of social history that became the most prestigious in the English-speaking world. Kiernan wrote a major essay in 1952 for the first issue of the journal (\\"Evangelicalism and the French Revolution\\"), produced several landmark articles, and later served on its editorial board from 1973 to 1983. He also contributed to New Left Review throughout the journal's transitions. While Thompson, Hill and Hilton were rooted in English social history, Kiernan and Hobsbawm practised a historical craft with more global aspirations. Kiernan's distinctive contributions included the study of elites in history, the mythologies of imperialism, the folklore of capitalism and conservatism, and literature and social change. Kiernan and Urdu poetry While steeped in Western literature and the classical heritage of Horace, Kiernan called for an appreciation of Urdu poetry, as he translated works from its literary golden age spanning from Ghalib (1796-1869) to Allama Iqbal (1877-1938) to Faiz Ahmad Faiz (1911-1984). He elevated writers from the East who had been largely banished by guardians of the Western canon and then overlooked by stylish post-modern literary figures looking for more transgressive exemplars of literary craft. Marriages He was married twice: to the Indian theatre director, dancer and playwright Shanta Gandhi (Bollywood actress Dina Pathak's sister), from 1938 to 1946; and to the Canadian scholar Heather Massey, from 1984 until his death.

Chapman by artist Raymond Persinger located at the entrance of Chapman University Charles Clarke Chapman (1853‚Äì1944) was the first mayor of Fullerton, California and a relative of John Chapman, the legendary \\"Johnny Appleseed\\". He was a native of Illinois who had been a Chicago publisher before settling in Southern California. Chapman was a supporter of the Disciples of Christ, who was a primary donor and fundraiser for California Christian College, which in 1934 changed its name to Chapman College, and is now Chapman University, in his honor. Chapman Avenue, a major Orange County thoroughfare, is also named in his honor. Chapman's citrus empire Early involvement in the California citrus industry Charles Chapman was born in Macomb, Illinois on July 2, 1853. In 1894, Chapman moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles. There, he bought an orange grove in Placentia as a hobby; this was his first foray into the citrus business. Chapman's innovation in regards to oranges contributed to his success in the industry. He had his workers wear gloves and use rounded-tip clippers to prevent the creation of small holes in the orange, as these holes could increase the likelihood of the presence of mold. Due to Chapman's innovative spirit, he soon became incredibly successful within the citrus industry and was given the nickname of the \\"Orange King\\". However, he was concerned about how his oranges would compete with European oranges from Spain and Italy. Because of this, in 1906, he and a few other citrus growers successfully lobbied the House Ways and Means Committee for a one-cent-per-pound tariff on European oranges. Valencia oranges Chapman found that Valencia oranges could be left on the trees for an extra six months after ripening. This allowed him to ship oranges to customers in months that were previously thought to be out of season for oranges. This was in contrast to the more famous Washington navel oranges that dominated the citrus business at the time. Valencia oranges grown in Orange County, at one time, made more profit than the oranges of any other location.Chapman, Charles C., \\"Citrus Talks-The Wealth of the Valencia\\" (1922). Charles C. Chapman Citrus Speeches. 29. Use of fertilizers While growing his business, Chapman experimented with different types of fertilizers to see which ones would yield the best orange crops. While Chapman was unsure about a fertilizer's ability to create better oranges than the more traditional method of growing oranges (i.e., plowing, irrigation, cultivation), he vowed to experiment with giving his oranges \\"plant food.\\" He tested several different fertilizers: sheep manure, lime cake, bone meal, commercial fertilizers, and a combination of each. He found that there were no discernible quality differences between the crops yielded with fertilizers use. He eventually concluded that none of the tested fertilizers' crops resulted in a better orange than the crops grown without fertilizer aid. He attributed these results to sufficient nutrients already present in the soil paired with proper farming techniques.Chapman, Charles C., \\"Citrus Notes- Fertilization\\" (2014). Charles C. Chapman Citrus Speeches. 14. Marketing Chapman firmly believed that the marketing of oranges should begin as soon as it is taken off the tree. In the packinghouses, the oranges must be clean and handled properly since too much fruit arrives in the markets in poor conditions. According to Chapman, shipments sent to the markets should include only the very best oranges. Chapman also thought that orange brands should build up their reputations and establish trade in specific markets instead of pandering to many different markets, as a brand of any item that is met with favor in a particular market will sell better in that market. He also believed in creating demand for oranges by advertising them as delicious, healthful items of luxury.Chapman, Charles C., \\"Citrus Talks-Marketing the Orange\\" (1904). Charles C. Chapman Citrus Speeches. 18. In addition to this, Chapman built his brand's popularity through his impressive crate label design. His \\"Old Mission\\" brand oranges' crate labels borrowed their name and imagery of Catholic monks and outdoor scenery from a famous novel at the time, Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson. Politics A Republican, Chapman was the first mayor of Fullerton, California, serving from 1904 to 1906. Personal life Chapman married Lizzie Pearson in Texas on October 23, 1884, and they had two children. She died in Los Angeles on September 19, 1894. He remarried, to Clara Irvin, on September 3, 1898. He died at his ranch in Fullerton on April 5, 1944.

A British branch was also active in the 1960s and 1970s. Bell Records was reorganized in November 1974, which was the birth of Arista Records. 1950s 7-inch 78 of \\"Cara Mia\\" by Helen Forrest for 39 cents, in a sleeve promoting the Dorsey brothers At its inception in 1952, Bell specialized in budget generic pop music, with the slogan \\"music for the millions\\". Originally sold on seven-inch 78rpm and 45rpm records for 39 cents (US), this style of music went out of fashion as rock and roll became more prevalent. Sound-alike cover versions of hit records were also issued on 78rpm as well as 45rpm disks priced at 49 cents. One of these records was by \\"Tom & Jerry\\" who would later become known using their real surnames, Simon & Garfunkel. Instead of being pressed into vinyl like a normal 7-inch disc, these records were injection molded by Bestway Products using polystyrene, which either had glued-on labels or the label information was printed directly on the polystyrene, rendering many copies almost unreadable years later. Most (but not all) Bell and associated label 45rpm records were similarly injection-molded all the way into the 1970s. As Al Massler, the head of record manufacturer Bestway Products, had become head of Bell Records in 1959, Mala Records was then formed as a Bell subsidiary label, specializing in rock and roll along with rhythm and blues. 1960s Side label of \\"Angel of the Morning,\\" with the logo used from 1964 to 1969 In 1960, Amy Records was formed as another subsidiary label, focusing on soul and/or blue-eyed soul acts. The following year, Larry Uttal folded his Madison Records label into Bell after purchasing the label, along with its Amy and Mala subsidiary labels. Concentrating his efforts on the Amy and Mala labels, Uttal rendered the Bell parent label dormant until 1964, when the label was revived, featuring a logo utilizing a stylized \\"BELL\\" word mark shaped like a bell. In 1966, the Bell label was expanded internationally and the company decided to issue all their albums, even for Amy and Mala acts, on the Bell label, and went on to issue several hit singles, including: \\"Little Girl\\" by Syndicate of Sound (#5 CB/#8 BB), \\"I'm Your Puppet\\" by James and Bobby Purify in 1966, \\"The Letter\\" by the Box Tops (the single on Mala, the album on Bell) in 1967, \\"Angel of the Morning\\" by Merrilee Rush & the Turnabouts in 1968, and \\"Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'\\" by Crazy Elephant in 1969. In March 1969, Columbia Pictures Industries (CPI) purchased Bell for $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retaining Larry Uttal as label president. Later that year, the Mala, Amy, and Bell labels were merged into a single unit, keeping the Bell moniker. By mid-1971, the assets of the Columbia Pictures owned, but RCA Records distributed, Colgems Records were integrated into the label. Uttal was instrumental in signing many soon- to-be-famous acts such as the Partridge Family, David Cassidy, Ricky Segall, the 5th Dimension, Barry Manilow, Melissa Manchester and Tony Orlando & Dawn, as well as adopting a new \\"thick-stripe\\" logo. 1970s 1970s thick-stripe version of the US record label. The UK label had a similar design. By 1970, the Bell label was more successful with pop music singles, and less successful with more lucrative pop LPs. After a year of declining revenues, Uttal resigned from Bell at the end of May 1974 to begin his own label, Private Stock, financed and distributed outside North America by EMI. Uttal was replaced as president a week later by Clive Davis, who had originally been hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures. Davis's real goal was to reorganize and revitalize Columbia Pictures's music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures's new record division, Arista Records, in November 1974 with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Bell had its final No. 1 hit in January 1975 with Barry Manilow's \\"Mandy\\" (Bell 45,613), followed shortly by the label's final hit, as well as its final single, \\"Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman\\" by Tony Orlando and Dawn (Bell 45,620‚ÄîUS #11) after which the more successful Bell albums were reissued on Arista. The very last releases utilizing the Bell imprint have the designation \\"Bell Records, Distributed by Arista Records, 1776 Broadway, New York City 10019\\" around the rim of the label. Bell Records also had a division in Japan that was notable for reissuing Colgems original recordings, most notably the Monkees, who enjoyed considerable success in the country well into the 1970's. In 1974, while the US Bell label released Re- Focus (a greatest hits compilation that was subsequently re-released several times on the Arista label as \\"The Monkees Greatest Hits\\"), The Japanese Bell label re-released the entire original Colgems LP catalog along with EP's, Box Sets and several Greatest Hits collections (including Re-Focus). While Bell Japan ignored the original Colgems single releases, they did however release the last single recorded by Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz (\\"Do it in the name of love\\"/\\"Lady Jane\\") as \\"the Monkees\\" unlike Bell in the US and UK, who opted to use their individual names. In 1973, Bell Japan also utilized the \\"Gold Disc\\" subsidiary label to release the 45 single \\"(Theme from) The Monkees\\"/\\"Daydream Believer\\" (released in the US on the Arista label). The third and final Monkees 45 released in 1973 featured the songs \\"I Wanna Be Free\\"/\\"Take A Giant Step\\".  Bell Records UK  The British branch was established in 1967. Previous British releases of Bell recordings were issued on EMI's Stateside Records. Bell/Amy/Mala's association with EMI dates back to 1964. Bell Records UK was opened as an independent label on January 1, 1972 in London, headed by Dick Leahy (general manager of the British branch in the previous year), continuing a three-year pressing and distribution agreement with EMI. (In other countries, apart from the United States, Polydor handled distribution which later picked up British distribution.) Artists signed to them included the Bay City Rollers, Showaddywaddy, The Glitter Band, and American acts Reparata and the Delrons and The Partridge Family with David Cassidy.

It underwent constant and massive changes in its script and score during out-of-town tryouts. The original book by Abe Burrows was seen in Philadelphia, then scrapped completely, and Edward Albee, an unlikely choice, was hired to re-write before a Boston tryout. Burrows was the original director but left when Albee was brought in. He was replaced by Joseph Anthony. On a daily basis, the cast was given new material hours before curtain time, and the piece was overly long, running nearly four hours.

Retrieved 22 April 2015. Cells from both the mesodermal and the ectodermal tissues contribute to the formation of the eye. Specifically, the eye is derived from the neuroepithelium, surface ectoderm, and the extracellular mesenchyme which consists of both the neural crest and mesoderm. Neuroepithelium forms the retina, ciliary body, iris, and optic nerves. Surface ectoderm forms the lens, corneal epithelium and eyelid. The extracellular mesenchyme forms the sclera, the corneal endothelium and stroma, blood vessels, muscles, and vitreous. The eye begins to develop as a pair of optic vesicles on each side of the forebrain at the end of the 4th week of pregnancy. Optic vesicles are outgrowings of the brain which make contact with the surface ectoderm and this contact induces changes necessary for further development of the eye. Through a groove at the bottom of the optic vesicle known as choroid fissure the blood vessels enter the eye. Several layers such as the neural tube, neural crest, surface ectoderm, and mesoderm contribute to the development of the eye. Eye development is initiated by the master control gene PAX6, a homeobox gene with known homologues in humans (aniridia), mice (small eye), and Drosophila (eyeless). The PAX6 gene locus is a transcription factor for the various genes and growth factors involved in eye formation.Keller, A. M. V., \\"Embryonic Development of the Eye\\". Retrieved 22 April 2015. Eye morphogenesis begins with the evagination, or outgrowth, of the optic grooves or sulci. These two grooves in the neural folds transform into optic vesicles with the closure of the neural tube.Fuhrmann, S., Levine, E. M. and Reh, T. A. (2000). \\"Extraocular mesenchyme patterns the optic vesicle during early eye development in the embryonic chick\\". Development 127, 4599‚Äì4609. The optic vesicles then develop into the optic cup with the inner layer forming the retina and the outer portion forming the retinal pigment epithelium. The middle portion of the optic cup develops into the ciliary body and iris.LifeMap Science, Inc. \\"Embryonic and Postnatal Development of the Eye\\". Retrieved 22 April 2015. During the invagination of the optic cup, the ectoderm begins to thicken and form the lens placode, which eventually separates from the ectoderm to form the lens vesicle at the open end of the optic cup. Further differentiation and mechanical rearrangement of cells in and around the optic cup gives rise to the fully developed eye. Sequential inductions This development is an example of sequential inductions where the organ is formed from three different tissues: Neural tube ectoderm (neuroectoderm) First, there is an outpocketing of the neural tube called optic vesicles. Development of the optic vesicles starts in the 3-week embryo, from a progressively deepening groove in the neural plate called the optic sulcus. Some studies suggest this mechanism is regulated by RX/RAX transcription factor.Fuhrmann, S., ‚ÄúEye Morphogenesis and Patterning of the Optic Vesicle‚Äù Current Topics in Developmental Biology 93, 61-84 (07 October 2010) The proteins Wnt and FGF (fibroblast growth factor) play a part in this early stage and are regulated by another protein called Shisa. As this expands, the rostral neuropore (the exit of the brain cavity out of the embryo) closes and the optic sulcus and the neural plate becomes the optic vesicle.\\"eye(vertebrate) McGraw-Hil; Encyclopedia of Science and Technology (2007), vol.6, pp.801-802 Optic nerves arise from connections of the vesicles to the forebrain. Neuroectoderm gives rise to the following compartments of the eye: *retina *epithelial lining of ciliary body and iris *optic nerves Surface ectoderm Lens development is closely related to optic vesicle development. The interaction between the growing vesicle and the ectoderm causes the ectoderm to thicken at that point. This thickened portion of the ectoderm is called the lens placode. Next, the placode invaginates and forms a pouch referred to as the lens pit. Scientists are studying the tension forces necessary for invagination of the lens placode and current research suggests that microfilaments might be present in early retinal cells to allow for invagination behavior. Research has also shown that Rho GTPase dependent filopodia from the precursor lens ectoderm play an important role in the formation of the lens pit.Fuhrmann, Sabine, ‚ÄúEye Morphogenesis and Patterning of the Optic Vesicle‚Äù Current Topics in Developmental Biology 93, 61-84 (07 October 2010) Eventually, the pit becomes completely enclosed. This enclosed structure is the lens vesicle. Studies have shown that lens development requires the presence of the Pax6 gene, which is the master regulatory gene for eye morphogenesis.Hill, M.A. (2015) Embryology Vision - Lens Development. Retrieved April 22, 2015. This master regulatory gene is not necessary for the closely associated optic vesicle development.Adler, R., Canto-Soler, M.V., ‚ÄúMolecular mechanisms of optic vesicle development: Complexities, ambiguities and controversies‚Äù, Developmental Biology 305,1,1-13 (1 May 2007) Additionally, Ras activation has been shown to be sufficient for starting lens differentiation, but not enough for its completion. The optic vesicles then begin to form the optic cup . Optic cup morphogenesis is the invagination process occurring after neuroectoderm movement forms the spherical optic vesicle (Phase 1). Invagination is when a tissue folds back on itself. Over the course of approximately 12 hours, the distal end of the optic vesicle inner layer begins to flatten (Phase 2). Over the following 18 hours, both the inner and outer layers begin to flex inward at sharp angles, beginning the formation of a C-shaped edge (Phase 3). The final 18 hours involve continuing this apically convex invagination to form the optic cup . At this point, morphologies such as columnar epithelial cells, pseudo-stratified cells, and apically narrow wedge-shaped cells can be observed.Eiraku et al., \\"Self- organizing optic-cup morphogenesis in three-dimensional cell culture\\", Nature 472, 51‚Äì56 (07 April 2011) The inner layer of the optic cup is made of neuroepithelium (neural retina), while the outer layer is composed of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Experiments have determined that RPE cell differentiation and maintenance requires interaction with neighboring tissues, most likely canonical Wnt signaling, while neural retina differentiation is driven by tissue-autonomous factors. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of optic cup development. In fact, research studies have shown that BMP agonists and antagonists are necessary for precision of optic cup development. Interactions between tissues and signaling pathways also play a major role in morphogenesis of the optic cup. It is of interest to note that research has shown isolating the optic cup from neighboring tissue after completed invagination in tissue culture medium can lead to the development of most major parts of the eye, including photoreceptors, ganglion cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells and Muller glia. This indicates that morphogenesis of the optic cup occurs independently of external cues from its environment, including presence of lens. However, the lens is necessary to act as an inducer for the ectoderm to transform it into the cornea. Surface ectoderm produces the following parts: *lens *corneal epithelium *skin of eyelid Neural crest Neural crest cells are themselves derived from the ectoderm and lie close to the neural tube: *sclera *Cornea: Descemet's membrane and endothelium *connective tissue and bony structure of the orbit Mesoderm Mesoderm contributes to the following structures: *extraocular muscles *endothelial lining of blood vessels of the eye *blood vessels in sclera & choroid *Sclera & Choroid *Vitreous *Suspensory fibres *Cornea: Bowman's membrane and stroma Developmental cascade According to Liem et al., the organogenesis of the eye is pointed out as an example of a developmental cascade of inductions. The eye is essentially a derivative of the ectoderm from the somatic ectoderm and neural tube, with a succession of inductions by the chordamesoderm. Chordamesoderm induces the anterior portion of the neural tube to form the precursors of the synapomorphic tripartite brain of vertebrates, and it will form a bulge called the diencephalon. Further induction by the chordamesoderm will form a protrusion: the optic vesicle. This vesicle will be subsequently invaginated by means of further inductions from the chordamesoderm. The optic vesicle will then induce the ectoderm that thickens (lens placode) and further invaginates to a point that detaches from the ectoderm and forms a neurogenic placode by itself. The lens placode is affected by the chordamesoderm making it to invaginate and forms the optic cup composed by an inner layer of neural retina and outer layer the pigmented retina that will unite and form the optic stalk. The pigmented retina is formed by rods and cones and composed of small cilia typical of the ependymal epithelium of the neural tube. Some cells in the lens vesicle will be fated to form the cornea and the lens vesicle will develop completely to form the definitive lens. Iris is formed from the optic cup cells. Responsivity of head epidermis Only the epidermis in the head is competent to respond to the signal from the optic vesicles. Both the optic vesicle and the head epidermis are required for eye development. The competence of the head epidermis to respond to the optic vesicle signals comes from the expression of Pax6 in the epidermis. Pax6 is necessary and sufficient for eye induction. This competence is acquired gradually during gastrulation and neurulation from interactions with the endoderm, mesoderm, and neural plate. Regulation and inhibition Sonic hedgehog reduces the expression of Pax6. When Shh is inhibited during development, the domain of expression for Pax6 is expanded and the eyes fail to separate causing cyclopia. Overexpression of Shh causes a loss of eye structures. Retinoic acid generated from vitamin A in the retina plays an essential role in eye development as a secreted paracrine signal which restricts invasion of perioptic mesenchyme around the optic cup. Vitamin A deficiency during embryogenesis results in anterior segment defects (particularly cornea and eyelids) that lead to vision loss or blindness. There is some evidence that LMX1B plays a role in periocular mesenchymal survival.

C√¢mpineanu Inn (Romanian: Hanul C√¢mpineanu) once stood in the place nowadays occupied by the passage. The old Inn was bought by Petros Seraphim, who gifted it to two of his daughters as dowries. Daughter Polixena married in 1843 Xavier Vilacrosse, Chief Architect of Bucharest, 1840‚Äì1848, the Inn renamed after him. Daughter Anastasia married Mihalache Macca, who built luxury shops on their part. In the late 1880s, the city decided to buy the sites to build a Western style passage to relieve congestion. It was designed by architect Felix Xenopol, and opened in 1891. Because the central part of the site was occupied by the Pesht Hotel, which the owner refused to sell, the passage was executed as a two- tined, fork-like shape with two wings around the two sides of the hotel. The narrow streets were covered with a glass roof, allowing the entry of natural light while providing shelter from the rain. The ground floor was meant for shops, while the rooms on the first floor were for rent. One branch of the passage was called Vilacrosse, while the other one was called Macca, after the old owners. The two-tined end opens onto Calea Victoriei, one of Bucharest's main avenues; the other end opens toward the National Bank in the historic Lipscani district. Pasajul Macca-Vilacrosse hosted the first Stock Exchange House of Bucharest, before a larger and more appropriate structure was built. Between 1950 and 1990 the passage was called Pasajul Bijuteria (\\"Jewelry Store Passage\\"), but the initial name was restored afterwards. Today it hosts several indoor/outdoor eating establishments, including an Egyptian-themed bar/restaurant, the Blues Cafe, a bistro, a Chinese restaurant and a wine bar.Inside the Macca Villacrosse Passage Image:Macca_Villacrosse_Passage.jpgImage:Pasajul Macca-Villacrosse - Vedere Interior.jpgImage:Pasajul Macca- Villacrosse.jpgImage:Macca-Villacrosse.jpgImage:Bucuresti, Romania, Pasajul Macca-Vilacrosse (3); B-II-a-A-19837.JPGImage:Wise Architectural Option.jpgImage:Pasajul Macca- Villacrosse, Bucure»ôti.jpgImage:Ansamblul arhitectural Pasajul Macca- Villacrosse, detalii.jpgImage:Lipscani 1.jpgImage:Pasajul Macca 4.jpgReferences Category:Buildings and structures in Bucharest Category:Historic monuments in Bucharest Category:Tourist attractions in Bucharest Category:Calea Victoriei ","title":"Pasajul Macca-Vilacrosse"},{"id":"8133345","text":"Live at Ronnie Scott's is a live album by British jazz singer Jamie Cullum.

It runs two acute hospitals in University Hospital of North Durham and Darlington Memorial Hospital as well as further non-acute centres at Shotley Bridge Hospital, Sedgefield Community Hospital, Richardson Community Hospital, Weardale Community Hospital, Bishop Auckland Hospital and Chester-le-Street Hospital. The Chief Executive is Sue Jacques. The most recent review of the Trust by the Care Quality Commission in 2019 provided an \\"Overall: Good\\" rating. In 2015 the trust established a subsidiary company, Synchronicity Care Ltd. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits, as well as pay bill savings, by recruiting new staff on less expensive non-NHS contracts. VAT benefits arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services. In 2018 it made a 14-year managed service agreement with Royal Philips Electronics to run imaging and cardiology services across four sites. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The Trust logged 1570 breaches of the 30 minute handover rule from ambulances to its A&E; department during the same period as well as 360 breaches of the 60 minute target, triggering fines of ¬£674,000. A Care Quality Commission survey found that the Trust was among the best in England for its maternity services in December 2013. A subsequent review by the CQC noted that \\"People were not being protected from the risks of unsafe or inappropriate care and treatment because accurate and appropriate records were not always being maintained.\\" From September 2017 all referrals to the trust are made electronically using the NHS e-Referral Service. This has reduced the rate of patients missing appointments from 10% to 5%.  Research  The Trust set up trial of a digital self-testing service for patients using Warfarin in 2013. They are given a Roche CoaguChek XS monitor and testing strips. This gives a reading of their international normalised ratio, a measure of how quickly blood clots ‚Äì which they can share with clinic staff via an automated phone call. The software which drives the automated process is produced by Inhealthcare Ltd. The 200 patients on the trial improved the time they were in therapeutic range from 60% of the time to 75% which reduces the risk of complications. They no longer have to come to the hospital every two weeks and are less likely to be admitted. Patients are enthusiastic about the benefits.

In 2008, BAMPFA unveiled plans for a new visual arts center, to be designed by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito and located in downtown Berkeley, across the street from UC Berkeley's main entrance. In 2009 those plans were cancelled. Citing the weak economy and trouble raising necessary funds, BAMPFA decided to retrofit and enlarge (rather than demolish) the former University of California Press printing plant at that site, a 1939 Art Deco building on the California Register of Historic Resources and qualified to be on the National Register of Historic Places. Sign for the new Berkeley Art Museum (detail), photo by Steven SaylorIn 2011, BAMPFA presented the schematic design for the $100 million transformation of the former printing plant into its new home, designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Located at 2120 Oxford Street in downtown Berkeley, the building combines the existing concrete structure with a new metal-clad, skylighted addition that includes several galleries, a 232-seat theater, a store and a learning center. Construction began in 2013. The museum re-opened to the public on January 31, 2016. The building totals 83,000 square feet, with 25,000 square feet of gallery space.

Its goal is to ease the distribution of existing model checkers. It has also been designed to provide the most generic interfaces, without sacrificing performance, thanks to the C++ language. Model checking offers a way to automatically prove that a modeled system behavior is correct by verifying properties. However, it suffers from the so-called state space explosion problem, caused by an intensive use of memory. Many solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem (e.g. symbolic representations with decisions diagrams - like BDD) but these methods can rapidly lead to an unacceptable time consumption. Distributed model checking is a way to overcome both memory and time consumptions by using aggregated resources of a dedicated cluster.

In a productive region of a state with 100% of its coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers, one mine owner attempted to open a non-union shop. In the resulting conflict, mines were flooded by sabotage, and on July 17 a crowd of union miners and sympathizers destroyed the surface plant of the Prairie Creek coal mine #3 and murdered two non-union miners. Resulting litigation in federal courts stretched to an out-of-court settlement of a nominal $27,500 in 1927. Background The coal fields and economic prosperity in Sebastian County, Arkansas peaked between 1910 and 1920, with the population in Hartford, Arkansas reaching 4,000 at one point. The clean burning coal yielded from the mines that stretched all along the Hartford/Hackett/Huntington corridor attracted mining interests. Incoming miners were mostly of Italian, German, Polish and Greek heritage. Local miners had first organized under the Knights of Labor and were, by 1914, earning union wages and benefits under representation of the UMW District 21. All of the mines in the entire state were operated under union representation, except for operations owned by Franklin Bache and Heber Denman. Since 1910 Bache had been using shell companies to try to circumvent UMW's joint interstate contract and scale of wages for District 21. As that governing agreement was scheduled to expire July 1, 1914, Bache announced in March that he intended to turn his mines into non-union operations. Bache informed Pete Stewart, executive with the UMW, then shut down his mines and prepared to reopen them on an open shop basis on April 6. Anticipating trouble, Bache employed three guards from the Burns Detective Agency and a number of others to aid him. Hearing rumors of a possible armed confrontation with the disgruntled miners, Bache bought a number of Winchester rifles and ammunition, and surrounded his principal mining plant at Prairie Creek, No. 4, with cables strung on posts. Bache then had notices prepared and sent to all of his employees who occupied the company's houses that they should vacate unless they remained in his employ under the new conditions. About 30 nonunion men had agreed to show up for work on the date fixed for the mines to be reopened. The people in the area were urged by the members of the local unions to come to a meeting at the schoolhouse, a short distance from the Prairie Creek mine, for a public protest to the Bache‚ÄìDenman plans, which they felt would lead to the weakening of the union power throughout the region. The union officials appointed a committee to visit Bache and insist that the mine under his control remain a union shop. The guards, directed not to use their guns save to defend their own lives, were at the mercy of the union miners, who assaulted them, took their guns away, and injured a number of them. As the union men advanced on the site, the employees deserted the mine which filled with water once the rioters had destroyed the main pumps at the operation. Bache obtained from the federal District Court an injunction against the union miners and others taking part in the violence, including among them the president of No. 21, Pete Stewart, and other union officials. Bach then prepared to resume mining, with the work progressing under the protection of United States deputy marshals. Meanwhile nonunion miners and other employees were brought in from out of the state and the equipment was repaired and rebuilt. The United States Marshals were withdrawn from the property on July 15, leaving only private guards and the Burns Detectives. Meanwhile the water had been pumped out and the mining and shipping of coal were about to begin. Riot On Sunday night, July 12, about midnight, there was a fusillade of shots into the homes in the small village of Frog town, about a mile and a half from Prairie Creek mine. A number of people, in fright at the cry that ‚Äúthe scabs were surrounding the town,‚Äù left and went to Hartford, which was about two miles away, and union employed guards were dispatched to Hartford to defend the town against the expected attack by the guards from Prairie Creek. According to eyewitnesses, the assault upon Frog town was merely a subterfuge and the shooting into the miner‚Äôs homes had been done by the Hartford constable ‚Äî a man named Slankard ‚Äî and another union miner in an effort to arouse the hostility of the neighborhood against the men at Prairie Creek. On the night of the 16th, the union miners' families who lived in Prairie Creek were warned by friends to leave that vicinity in order to avoid danger, and at 4 a.m. a volley of many shots fired into the premises began the following morning the attack. A large force of union miners of the local unions and those from other mines in District No. 21, as well as their sympathizers, armed themselves with rifles and other guns furnished and paid for by District No. 21 funds, and before daylight on July 17 began an attack upon the men whom Bache had brought together, and proceeded to destroy the property and equipment again. A large, union backed force with guns attacked the Prairie Creek site and other properties belonging to Bache, from all sides later on in the day. The first movement toward destruction of property was at Mine No. 3, a short distance from No. 4, where the coal washhouse was set on fire. The occupants of the premises were driven out, except a few who stayed and entrenched themselves behind coal cars or other protection. Most of the employees and their families fled to the ridges, behind which they were able to escape danger from the flying bullets. The forces surrounding the mine were so numerous that by 1 p.m. they had driven out practically all of the defenders, and set fire to the coal tipple of mine No. 4, and destroyed all the plant by the use of dynamite and torches. The assailants took some of Bache's employees prisoners as they were escaping, and took them to a log cabin behind the schoolhouse near the mine where the first riot meeting was held. The four or five prisoners were taken out of the cabin where they had been for a short time confined, and two of them, one a former union man, were deliberately murdered in the presence of their captors. The two were identified as 23-year-old J.E. Sylesberry and 45-year-old John Baskins, both mine guards.  Aftermath  Bache declared his ten businesses bankrupt on July 25, resulting in a decisive victory for the union. Litigation arising from the strike and riot reached the Supreme Court not once but twice, in 1922 as Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U.S. 344 and in 1925 as Coronado Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 268 U.S. 295. The receivers of the mine owners had alleged restraint of trade against the union. Ultimately the parties settled out of court in 1927 for $27,500, reversing prior awards of more than $700,000. By that time, mine workers' unions in Arkansas had completely collapsed. Federal indictments came down on a number of prominent labor figures. In a plea deal arranged between prosecutors and the UMW, a few defendants received jail time of up to two years, and fines of up to $1000. The union paid the fines. Two men were tried for the murders of Sylesberry and Baskins in January 1915. Partly because \\"most of the state's witnesses could not be found when it came to trial\\", both were acquitted.

The Bald Eagle Valley lies in the central portion of Centre County and the southern portion of Clinton County. It runs from Port Matilda down to Lock Haven PA, It includes most of the Bald Eagle Area School District and Bald Eagle Township. The Bald Eagle State Park is also in the valley.

From Southwest to Northeast, down stream along the Bald Eagle Creek: *Port Matilda *Julian *Unionville *Milesburg *Howard *Beech Creek *Mill Hall *Lock Haven Agriculture In the upper valley, the Bald Eagle Creek runs at the foot of the ridge in a narrow floodplain. Long narrow farm fields lie along the river, and along the perpendicular side vallies of the creek's tributaries. Smaller irregular sloped fields also lie on the small hills near the floodplain. Further down stream, the flood plain becomes wider, and larger farm fields are found there. Between the flood plain and the plateau, there are two distinct regions. Nearer the flood plain, there are steeper wooded hills, generally not suitable for farming. Closer to the plateau, there are more gently rolling hills, with fields and pastures mixed with woodlots. Corn, hay, alfalfa, and winter wheat are crops commonly grown in the valley. Transportation The Ridge Soaring Gliderport in the Bald Eagle Valley, looking southwest toward Julian.

The road north of there is now known as U.S. 220 Alternate. I-80 runs east-west across the valley between Snow Shoe, Pennsylvania and Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. U.S. Route 322, Skytop Mountain Road, also crosses the valley through Port Matilda, and across the ridge in a cut at \\"Skytop\\". I-99 runs through the upper valley mostly along the ridge, then wraps around Port Matilda to pick up U.S. 322 in a tandem alignment, before crossing the ridge in the now expanded Skytop cut. Canal The Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation began building up the Bald Eagle Valley from Lock Haven in 1834. It reached Howard in 1837, but construction stalled, and it only reached Milesburg in 1847, and Bellefonte in 1848. Initially successful, the canal began to face railroad competition during the American Civil War, and was not rebuilt after its destruction by flooding in 1865. Rail Construction began in 1858 on Centre County's first railroad, the Bellefonte and Snow Shoe Railroad, which entered the valley through the Spring Creek water gap at Milesburg. By 1862 the line up the Wallace Run side valley, from Wingate to the timber and coal resources of Snow Shoe, was completed. It ran along the stream bed to the foot of the Allegheny Front, then climbed half of the line's vertical rise via a unique series of switchbacks in a steep box canyon near . The Pennsylvania Railroad financed the construction of the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad line through the valley, along the flood plain from Tyrone to Lock Haven. When completed in 1865, it used the Bellefonte & Snow Shoe Railroad track between Wingate and Milesburg. The Pennsylvania Railroad bought the Bellefonte & Snow Shoe Railroad in 1881, making its former line the Snow Shoe and Bellefonte branches. The Snow Shoe branch has been abandoned, but the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad short line still runs the lines from Tyrone to Lock Haven and Bellefonte. Air Ridge Soaring Gliderport, the only airport in the valley, is active (except in winter) with pilot training and glider rides. The former Peterson Memorial Airport, near Tyrone, closed in 1976, and was converted to an industrial park. Geology Bald Eagle Valley is in the western part of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. During the Appalachian orogeny, sedimentary rock layers on the supercontinent of Pangaea were folded, forming a huge mountain range. The Nittany Arch was an ancient Himalayan-scale mountain that once towered above what is now the adjacent Nittany Valley. The oldest rock layers from deep within the eroded mountain are now exposed on the east side of the Bald Eagle ridge. Younger rocks from the outer layers of the arch are exposed in the Bald Eagle Valley, with the youngest at the foot of the Allegheny Front. The rock layers in the valley were folded from horizontal to almost vertical, and now read like pages in a geologic history book covering the entire Devonian period. The vertical attitude of the rocks also contributes to the straightness of the valley. Erosion resistant Silurian Tuscarora Formation Quartzite left the Bald Eagle ridge standing above the valley. The Bald Eagle Creek runs at the foot of the ridge on a bed of Devonian Hamilton Group Shale. Durable Lock Haven Formation Mudstone forms a parallel series of steep elongated knolls running west of the floodplain, some almost as high as the ridge. Catskill Formation Sandstone underlies a series of lower gently rolling hills at the foot of the plateau, which is in turn formed from uplifted Mississippian Sandstone.

As traditionally described, it is a four strand diamond knot in which six of the eight ends loop back into the knot, thus allowing it to be tied with a single line. While a specific knot is discussed in this article, the fiador knot has also been treated as an entire class of multi-strand knots similarly made with a single line. Etymology The origin of the variant name \\"Theodore knot\\", used in the United States, is a corruption of the Spanish fiador. American cowboys likewise corrupted a number of other closely related terms, substituting \\"hackamore\\" for jaquima and \\"McCarty\\" for mecate. Knotting authority Clifford Ashley relates Philip Ashton Rollins's suggestion that, \\"When Theodore Roosevelt, 'the hero of San Juan Hill,' visited the Southwest, shortly after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, it was a foregone conclusion that the Spanish name 'Fiador' would be corrupted to 'Theodore' in his honor.\\" Tying Considered a difficult knot to tie, cowboys were said to have been able to collect a fee for tying it. Ashley went so far as to include it in a chapter covering trick knots in The Ashley Book of Knots stating archly, \\"the trick is to succeed in tying it.\\"Ashley, p. 413 Many methods have been devised to tie the fiador knot, including fixtures used to hold the parts in shape while tying. More recent sources have shown a simpler method of forming the fiador knot using a flat precursor knot.Ulrich(1986), p. 32 The following images show a method for tying the fiador knot: File:Fiador_knot_ABOK_1110_Tying_Step_1.jpg File:Fiador_knot_ABOK_1110_Tying_Step_2.jpg File:Fiador_knot_ABOK_1110_Tying_Step_3.jpg File:Fiador_knot_ABOK_1110_Tying_Step_4.jpg Tight face and loose face Careful inspection reveals the two faces of the completed fiador knot, where the four strands emerge, are not identical. One has the appearance of a crown knot surrounding the emerging strands and is somewhat resistant to spreading when they are pulled apart. By comparison, the strands emerging from the other face of the knot are not nearly as well-contained and if pulled apart, the fiador knot easily distorts and splays. Depending on how the fiador knot is tied, these distinct faces can be positioned differently with respect to the side of the knot with the two loops and the side with a single loop and the two free ends. While most sources fail to discuss and differentiate the two faces, those that do suggest the tight face is best oriented towards single loop and two free ends if the knot is to be used in a rope fiador.All photos on this page show the completed knot in this configuration. The rationale stated is that the single loop and free end side of the knot will be subject to more spreading when it passed around the neck of the horse. By contrast, the strands on the two-loop side of the fiador knot will generally be kept together by the double hackamore knot immediately below it.Ulrich(1986), pp. 3‚Äì4Schaake, et al.(1990), pp. 8 & 15 Regardless of the original tying method, the orientation of the tight and loose faces can be swapped in the completed knot. By loosening the fiador knot, the tight face can be pressed towards, over, and around the rest of the knot. The knot will invert, \\"much the same as a mitten is turned inside out.\\"Ulrich(1986), p. 25 When retightened, the tight and loose faces will have been exchanged. Uses by equestrians A mockup of the three knots used on a hackamore's fiador with the fiador knot in the center. There are several ways the fiador knot is used with certain types of horse tack: *The knot is used on, and shares its name with, the fiador of a hackamore.Grant, Bruce and Rice, Lee. How to Make Cowboy Horse Gear Cornell Maritime Press; 2nd edition (June 1956), , The fiador knot holds the four strands of the fiador together under the horse's jaw, while a doubled bottle sling‚Äîsometimes called a \\"hackamore knot\\" in this context‚Äîis used to attach the fiador to the heel knot of the bosal, or noseband, of the hackamore. A becket hitch is used to secure the fiador around the throatlatch of the horse. In North America, again according to Ashley, \\"...the method originated in the South American pampas and worked its way, via Mexico, to the Southwestern cow country, arriving there soon after the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.\\" *On knotted rope halters, the knot often is used under the jaw both as a decorative knot, and also to fashion the lower loop onto which a lead rope is attached. On a rope halter, the fiador knot is made from one continuous piece of rope, and is, along with a series of double overhand knots, one of two types of knots that comprise most rope halters. *For one style of rope hobbles, a brass ring may be attached to the double loops on one side of the knot to join the hobble for the horse's other front foot. On the other side, a diamond knot terminates the two loose ends and the single loop is placed over this to encircle the horse's fetlock. A small rope slide (melted with a solder iron) on this single loop is pushed against the diamond knot to prevent the loop from slipping off the foot.

Typically, the pain is in the right upper part of the abdomen. Pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to a few hours. Often, it occurs after eating a heavy meal, or during the night. Repeated attacks are common. Gallstone formation occurs from the precipitation of crystals that aggregate to form stones. The most common form is cholesterol gallstones. Other forms include calcium, bilirubin, pigment, and mixed gallstones. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include appendicitis, stomach ulcers, pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Treatment for gallbladder attacks is typically surgery to remove the gallbladder. This can be either done through small incisions or through a single larger incision. Open surgery through a larger incision is associated with more complications than surgery through small incisions. Surgery is typically done under general anesthesia. In those who are unable to have surgery, medication to try to dissolve the stones or shock wave lithotripsy may be tried. it is not clear whether surgery is indicated for everyone with biliary colic. In the developed world, 10 to 15% of adults have gallstones. Of those with gallstones, biliary colic occurs in 1 to 4% each year. Nearly 30% of people have further problems related to gallstones in the year following an attack. About 15% of people with biliary colic eventually develop inflammation of the gallbladder if not treated. Other complications include inflammation of the pancreas. Signs and symptoms Pain is the most common presenting symptom. It is usually described as sharp right upper quadrant pain that radiates to the right shoulder, or less commonly, behind the breastbone. Nausea and vomiting can be associated with biliary colic. Individuals may also present with pain that is induced following a fatty meal and the symptom of indigestion. The pain often lasts longer than 30 minutes, up to a few hours. Patients usually have normal vital signs with biliary colic, whereas patients with cholecystitis are usually febrile and more ill appearing. Lab studies that should be ordered include a complete blood count, liver function tests and lipase. In biliary colic, lab findings are usually within normal limits. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase are usually suggestive of liver disease whereas elevation of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggests common bile duct obstruction. Pancreatitis should be considered if the lipase value is elevated; gallstone disease is the major cause of pancreatitis. Causes Biliary pain is most frequently caused by obstruction of the common bile duct or the cystic duct by a gallstone. However, the presence of gallstones is a frequent incidental finding and does not always necessitate treatment, in the absence of identifiable disease. Furthermore, biliary pain may be associated with functional disorders of the biliary tract, so called acalculous biliary pain (pain without stones), and can even be found in patients post-cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder), possibly as a consequence of dysfunction of the biliary tree and the sphincter of Oddi. Acute episodes of biliary pain may be induced or exacerbated by certain foods, most commonly those high in fat. Risk factors Cholesterol gallstone formation risk factors include age, female sex, family history, race, pregnancy, parity, obesity, hormonal birth control, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, prolonged fasting, rapid weight loss, total parenteral nutrition, ileal disease and impaired gallbladder emptying. Patients that have gallstones and biliary colic are at increased risk for complications, including cholecystitis. Complications from gallstone disease is 0.3% per year and therefore prophylactic cholecystectomy are rarely indicated unless part of a special population that includes porcelain gallbladder, individuals eligible for organ transplant, diabetics and those with sickle cell anemia. Diagnosis Diagnosis is guided by the person's presenting symptoms and laboratory findings. The gold standard imaging modality for the presence of gallstones is ultrasound of the right upper quadrant. There are many reasons for this choice, including no exposure to radiation, low cost, and availability in city, urban, and rural hospitals. Gallstones are detected with a specificity and sensitivity of greater than 95% with ultrasound. Further signs on ultrasound may suggest cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis. Computed Tomography (CT) is not indicated when investigating for gallbladder disease as 60% of stones are not radiopaque. CT should only be utilized if other intra- abdominal pathology exists or the diagnosis is uncertain. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be used only if lab tests suggest the existence of a gallstone in the bile duct. ERCP is then both diagnostic and therapeutic. Management Medications Initial management includes the relief of symptoms and correcting electrolyte and fluid imbalance that may occur with vomiting. Antiemetics, such as dimenhydrinate, are used to treat the nausea. Pain may be treated with anti- inflammatories, NSAIDs such as ketorolac or diclofenac. Opioids, such as morphine, less commonly may be used. NSAIDs are more or less equivalent to opioids. Hyoscine butylbromide, an antispasmodic, is also indicated in biliary colic. In biliary colic, the risk of infection is minimal and therefore antibiotics are not required. Presence of infection indicates cholecystitis. Surgery It is unclear whether those experiencing a gallstone attack should receive surgical treatment or not. The scientific basis to assess whether surgery outperformed other treatment was insufficient and better studies were needed as of a SBU report in 2017. Treatment of biliary colic is dictated by the underlying cause. The presence of gallstones, usually visualized by ultrasound, generally necessitates a surgical treatment (removal of the gall bladder, typically via laparoscopy). Removal of the gallbladder with surgery, known as a cholecystectomy, is the definitive surgical treatment for biliary colic. A 2013 Cochrane review found tentative evidence to suggest that early gallbladder removal may be better than delayed removal. Early laparoscopic cholescystectomy happens within 72 hours of diagnosis. In a Cochrane review that evaluated receiving early versus delayed surgery, they found that 23% of those who waited on average 4 months ended up in hospital for complications, compared to none with early intervention with surgery. Early intervention has other advantages including reduced number of visits to the emergency department, fewer conversions to an open surgery, less operating time required, and reduced time in hospital post operatively. The Swedish agency SBU estimated in 2017 that increasing acute phase surgeries could free multiple in-hospital days per patient and would additionally spare pain and suffering in wait of receiving an operation. The report found that those with acute inflammation of the gallbladder can be surgically treated in the acute phase, within a few days of symptom debut, without increasing the risk for complications (compared to when the surgery is done later in an asymptomatic stage). Complications The presence of gallstones can lead to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or the biliary tree (cholangitis) or acute inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Rarely, a gallstone can become impacted in the ileocecal valve that joins the caecum and the ileum, causing gallstone ileus (mechanical ileus). Complications from delayed surgery include pancreatitis, empyema, and perforation of the gallbladder, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and obstructive jaundice. Biliary pain in the absence of gallstones, known as postcholecystectomy syndrome, may severely affect the patient's quality of life, even in the absence of disease progression. Epidemiology The annual risk of developing biliary colic is 2 to 3%.

Etymology In 1956, it was named Shelekhov honoring a Russian explorer Grigory Shelikhov. The name of the city is spelled differently from the surname of the explorer as Grigory himself used two different signatures with both spelling variants of his surname. In 1962, Shelekhov was granted town status. Development The city was founded in May 1953 when the first construction workers of the Irkutsk Aluminum Smelter had installed the first six housing tents. In memory of these first construction workers, a monument of concrete in the form of tents referred to as \\"The First Tent\\" was erected near the administrative building of the plant. However, this year mostly symbolizes first mention of an actual inhabited area as the settlement was then called by the abbreviation of the aluminum plant- IrkAZ, and not Shelekhov. According to GIPROGOR, a Russian urban planning and investment company, it was initially planned to create a city with a population of 100,000 people. The first inhabitants were the people of the villages Olkha, Markovo, Vvedenschina and the settlement of Bolshoj Lug. On March 30, 1954 the commission adopted a temporary construction scheme of dwelling houses. In autumn a film projector was launched that held regular movie showings.

MOSIS began in 1981 after Lynn Conway organized the first VLSI System Design Course at MIT in 1978. MOSIS primarily services commercial users now but continues to serve university students and researchers. With MOSIS, designs are submitted for fabrication using either open (i.e., non-proprietary) VLSI layout design rules or vendor proprietary rules. Designs are pooled into common lots and run through the fabrication process at foundries. The completed chips (packaged or unpackaged) are returned to customers. BaySand announced their ASIC MPW Shuttle Program, named ASIC UltraShuttle. BaySand stated that their shuttle program enables customer to tapeout from RTL and BaySand will deliver 100 units of tested, packaged chips within 8 weeks. Many silicon fabrication facilities offer MPW runs or a company can produce its own MPW, e.g. combine several of its own designs to form one wafer completely owned by the company. In the latter case, it may be profitable to use most of the wafer for production chips and a small portion for producing prototypes of next generation chips.

Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary DutY Assignments, TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations (2001-?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard. Active duty callups For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period (this policy was due to change 1 August 2007; the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months; individual states have differing policies). History The South Carolina Army National Guard was originally formed in 1670. The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. The South Carolina National Guard's militia predecessors saw action in the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican War, American Civil War, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. South Carolina's National Guard first served in their National Guard capacity on the Mexican Border during the Punitive Expedition of 1916‚Äì1917. With the United States entry into the First World War, the SCNG was federalized and several key units were composed of National Guard troops from the state. The 118th Infantry of the 30th Division and the 117th Engineers, along with the 105th Ammunition Train, 105th Sanitary Train, 30th Division Sanitary Detachment, and HQ Company of the 30th Division.\\"Murphy, Elmer and Thomas,Robert. \\"The Thirtieth Division in the World War\\". 1936 The 118th Infantry (formerly the 1st SC Infantry) formed one of the four infantry regiments that made up the 30th Division. The 30th trained at Camp Sevier outside Greenville, SC and was sent to France. The 118th, along with the rest of the division (minus the division's artillery regiment) fought under British Expeditionary Force command. The 30th alongside the 27th Division (the federalized NY National Guard) formed 2nd Corps. After further training with the British, the 30th Division was sent to Kemmel, Belgium (just south of Ypres), where the 118th got their first time in the trenches. Although relatively quiet, the 118th was able to learn a great deal from this experience. In preparation for the last great Allied Offensive, the division trained alongside tanks prior to being moved to the edge of the German Hindenburg Line. On 29 September, the 118th infantry in reserve supported the breaking of the Hindenburg Line by other units of the 30th Division near the French village of Bellicourt. Following this success, the division continued to fight a retreating, but not defeated German Army. They suffered heavy casualties to German artillery, gas, and machine gun fire. The 118th fought until 19 October, not seeing combat again prior to the Armistice. The 118th had six Medal of Honor recipients (two posthumous)in their ranks to include future SCNG Adjutant General James Dozier. Many more men of the regiment were awarded Distinguished Service Crosses and foreign awards for valor. 118th Infantry Regiment Burial Party Brancourt, France 11 Oct. 1918 The first battalion of the 117th Engineers were formed as part of the 42nd Infantry Division. They were joined with men from the California National Guard to create the 117th Engineers. The 42nd, known as the Rainbow Division, earned its name due to the efforts made to create a unit that encompassed men from around the country.The 117th Engineers were tasked with road construction, road repair, construction of shelters, construction and repair of trenches, wiring and cutting of barbed wire, establishing assault paths, and clearing of obstacles. They performed all of these duties in addition to standing in as infantry in several circumstances and policing the battlefield of human remains. They participated in four campaigns: the Champagne Marne, the Aisne Marne, the Saint Mihiel Offensive, and the Meuse Argonne. The 117th served with the 42nd Division through the Armistice.Snead, David l. \\"South Carolina Engineers in the 42nd (Rainbow) Division in World War I\\".2003. https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context;=hist_fac_pubs The 118th Infantry was reactivated in World War Two. The regiment became a Separate Infantry Regiment as the Army restructured with only three, not four regiments making up an infantry division. For that reason, the 118th was not part of the 30th Division like they had been during the First World War. The 118th regiment was first deployed to Iceland. Their purpose was to defend the island nation and Allied assets, from the threat of German invasion. The 118th was eventually sent to England where individual companies served as cadre to train replacements and zero weapons. Elements of the 2nd Battalion protected bridges during the Battle of the Bulge. An AH-64 Apache of the 151st Aviation Regiment South Carolina aviation troops and their AH-64 Apache attack helicopters were called to Kuwait as part of Operation Southern Watch between August 1999 and February 2000. As Task Force 151, commanded by LTC David Anderson, the Task Force was augmented by Mississippi and Minnesota Army National Guard units, along with individual personnel from the National Guards of New Hampshire, Arizona, and Washington state. South Carolina's C Company, 1-151st Aviation was deployed to Kosovo under operational control of 1-104 AVN of the Pennsylvania ARNG (as were National Guard aviation units from Alabama and Nebraska) during KFOR 5A operations from July 2003 to February 2004. Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC),along with A, B, D, and L Companies of the 1-151st Aviation were deployed as Task Force 1-151st Aviation during Operation Iraqi Freedom II & III from October 2004 to October 2005, where they gained fame flying their AH-64A Apaches in an experimental two-tone grey scheme in support of the 1st Stryker Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (Light), and then supported operations of the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) in Al-Anbar Province. Task Force 1-151 was augmented with National Guard personnel from Tennessee, Missouri, and Maryland and the Individual Ready Reserve of the Army. L Company, 1-151 was augmented with National Guard personnel from Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, and Wyoming, serving with distinction during OIF. In the fall of 2008, a CH-47D Detachment, B Company, 2-238th Aviation was activated in support of OEF, and deployed to Afghanistan. Paired with Illinois National Guard, B Company was split between three different forward operating bases, Bagram, Kandahar/Shank, and Salerno, with each acting independently of the others. The detachment's main missions included resupply, troop movement, and air assaults on high-value targets. B Company, 2-238th Aviation returned home in fall of 2009 after serving with great distinction and perseverance during Operation Enduring Freedom II.

As a young man he was associated with the beginning of tourism down the River Wye and later with the controversial appointment of an English monoglot to a Welsh-speaking parish in Anglesey. Life John Egerton was the son of Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, by Lady Elizabeth Ariana Bentinck, daughter of the Earl of Portland. After education at Eton College and at Oriel College, Oxford, he followed his father into the church and was ordained priest on 22 December 1745, and on the 23rd of the same month was collated by his father to the rectory of Ross-on-Wye. The rectory at Ross was a favorite residence of his for much of his life, to which he often invited friends and family members. Having had a boat specially made, he began taking his visitors on trips down the River Wye and such was their popularity that they became a regular feature. In consequence Egerton was later credited as \\"the father of the voyage down the Wye\\".The excursion down the Wye, from Ross to Monmouth, Charles Heath, Monmouth 1808, ‚ÄúOn the origin of the excursion‚Äù Egerton was later made Bishop of Bangor 1756‚Äì68, during which time he caused controversy by appointing Thomas Bowles, a priest who spoke no Welsh, to a parish where almost no one spoke English. The case did not come to court until after Egerton had become Bishop of Lichfield (1768‚Äì71). Afterwards, having previously declined the primacy of Ireland, he shortly succeeded as Bishop of Durham and held that office until his death in 1787. At Durham he displayed a talent for conciliation in promoting peace and prosperity in the county, which had been divided by elections, and in the city, which had been torn by disputes. He was also a benefactor to the county by encouraging public works: He promoted the enclosure of Walling Fen; assisted materially in rebuilding a bridge over the Tyne between Newcastle and Gateshead; and in 1780 granted a new charter to the city of Durham. In addition, he made extensive improvements at the episcopal palaces and was a liberal supporter of many religious and educational institutions.\\"John Egerton\\", Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Volume 17 Family Egerton was the eldest son of Henry Egerton, himself a younger son of the 3rd Earl of Bridgewater. On 21 November 1748, he married his cousin, Lady Anne Grey, a daughter and coheiress of the 1st Duke of Kent. They had four children, one of whom died in infancy; the three others were: *Amelia (1751‚Äì1809), married Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet. *John William, later 7th Earl of Bridgewater (1753‚Äì1823) *Francis Henry, later 8th Earl of Bridgewater (1756‚Äì1829) Lady Anne died in 1780, and on 31 March 1782, Egerton married Mary Boughton, a sister of Sir Edward Boughton.

Biography Ryabushinsky was born into an Old Believer family that had prospered in the 19th century; like other scions of such merchant families, he had a good education (he spoke French, German, and English) and was anxious both to be accepted into high society and to improve his country. In 1907 he began publishing his own newspaper, Utro Rossii (The Morning of Russia), to propagate his liberal views. Rebuffed by the Constitutional Democrats, who did not want to be associated with the \\"narrow class interests\\" of industrialists, he and his fellow Old Believer Aleksandr Konovalov established contact with the \\"Right Kadets\\" associated with Peter Struve and began the Economic Discussions of 1909‚Äì12, \\"one of the few sustained collaborations between entrepreneurs and intellectuals in Russian history\\" (West, p. 46). He was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples. He and Konovalov founded the Progressist Party, which in 1915 became part of the Progressive Bloc; that same year he was elected Chairman of the Moscow Stock Exchange Committee and was appointed to head the Moscow War Industry Committee. This organisation exercised considerable autonomy from the Central War Industry Committee, negotiating contracts between entrepreneurs and the Military directly. After the February Revolution he opposed the Soviet and the participation of socialists in the Provisional Government. He gave a widely-reported speech at the All-Russian Commercial and Industrial Congress in August declaring that it was 'necessary for the bony hand of hunger and the people's poverty to grab by the throat the false friends of the people', referring to the Soviets. Following the failure of the Kornilov Affair, which he supported, he withdrew from politics and went to the Crimea for a tuberculosis cure. After the October Revolution he was accused of giving financial support to the All-Russian Teachers' Union, who had refused to continue to work under Bolshevik instruction. He subsequently emigrated to France, where he continued to hope that he and his entrepreneurial class might eventually play a role in the development of his native country.  References  James L.

He belongs to the period of medieval painting sometimes referred to as International Gothic. The Master is named after the Parement de Narbonne, a unique painted silk altar frontal or parament found in the former Cathedral of Saint Just at Narbonne and now in the Louvre in Paris. The Parement of Narbonne is 2.86 m long and 77.5 cm high, and is painted in black ink (strictly, grisaille) on silk. It includes scenes from the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, including the Kiss of Judas, the Flagellation, the Carrying of the Cross, the Entombment, the Descent into Limbo and the Noli Me Tangere. The then king of France, Charles V and his queen, Jeanne de Bourbon, are shown kneeling at either side of the cross in the central Crucifixion scene. Their presence suggests that the altarcloth was commissioned between 1364, the date of Charles's accession, and 1378, when the queen died. Its colour suggests that it was made for use during Lent, when it was conventional for richly coloured altarpieces to be covered by more simple drapes. Some illuminated manuscripts are attributed to the same artist or his circle, including some of the illustrations in the Book of Hours of Ren√© d'Anjou which is now in the British Library, and the important manuscript, now in different parts in several museums known as the Tr√®s Belles Heures de Notre Dame (BnF), and the Milan-Turin Hours. According to the British Library, the Parement Master may have been Jean d'Orleans, an artist who is known to have been employed by Charles V between 1340 and 1407. The style of the workshop of the Parement Master is distinctive. The figures are graceful and relatively realistic and three-dimensional in appearance, with expressive faces, but their heads tend to be disproportionate and heavy. Meiss (1967) suggests that the artists were influenced by earlier Italian painting, though others have drawn parallels with contemporary Bohemian style, or have seen northern (perhaps Flemish) influence in the realism of the faces. Both the handling of the grisaille technique and the box-like architectural frames in which some of the scenes are set indicate a keen awareness of the earlier work of Jean Pucelle (active in Paris in the 1320s).

Personal life Hern√°ndez was born in Castro, Chile on 1 December 1984. She spent her childhood years in the Chilo√© Island, the second-largest island in South America. The youngest of three children, her father died when she was young. She was raised by her mother, Yorki Escobar. Hern√°ndez studied tourism and took up modelling, then advanced her studies in Journalism. She once spent a month working as a model in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. After that, she lived in Santiago, the capital of Chile. She enjoys outdoor recreations such as cycling, jogging, and volleyball to maintain her figure, but not fascinated with heavy machines in the gym. She admires Oprah Winfrey and Tyra Banks and intends to be a broadcast journalist or a talk show host. Pageantry Before Miss Earth In 2004, she represented Chile in Miss Model of the World (Semifinalist) and South American Queen 2004. She also took part in Miss World Chile 2003 (Finalist) and Miss Earth Chile 2004 (First Runner-up). A year after, she competed in Miss Earth Chile for the second time and won the title Miss Earth Chile 2005. She succeeded Nataly Chilet Miss Earth Chile 2004, who was a top eight finalist at the Miss Earth 2005 pageant. These contests gave her the experience and path to be crowned Miss Earth 2006, the third most important international beauty pageant after Miss Universe and Miss World.http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/local- headlines/gorgeous_georgia_out_to_wow_judges_1_232243 Miss Earth 2006 In the 6th edition of Miss Earth beauty pageant, Hern√°ndez was declared the winner of Miss Earth 2006 that took place on 26 November 2006 in the grounds of the National Museum in Manila, Philippines. She beat eighty-one other delegates from other countries. She had a moment of confusion during the announcement of the winners and did not immediately realized that she won the grand title of the pageant. She stood beside Miss India (Amruta Patki) who was called first and then she was called second, but she did not remember how the order in which they were to name the grand winner. She recalled: \\"I congratulated her (Miss India) and then she told me that I was the grand winner and only then I realized what was happening. I was very happy with the first four places, then being the winner was just out of surprise.\\" Hern√°ndez was supposed the host delegate since the event was originally slated to be held in Santiago, Chile on 15 November 2006, but organizers missed the deadline for the event setup, therefore Miss Earth was moved to the Philippines. In winning Miss Earth, she delivered the second major international beauty title to Chile, 19 years after Cecilia Bolocco won Miss Universe. Media and Environmental activism Hern√°ndez arrived on 19 December 2006 in Santiago, Chile from Madrid, Spain and Buenos Aires, Argentina after she won Miss Earth 2006 in the Philippines. A press conference for her victory was immediately held at the press room of Santiago International Airport after nearly two months of her absence in Chile. Accompanied by politician and Chile personality, Andr√©s Celis, she graced the opening ceremony and a glamorous cocktail of Festival de Vi√±a del Mar, a musical event in South America, held on 19 February 2007 at the Casino de Vi√±a del Mar.\\"Tom Jones 'ruge' en la segunda noche del Festival de Vi√±a del Mar\\" Agence France-Presse.

Over 17,000 physicians, sonographers, nurses, veterinarians, and scientists, in 106 countries, are members of ASE, making it the largest global organization for cardiovascular ultrasound imaging and as such the leader and advocate, setting practice standards and guidelines for the field. Since 1975, the Society has been committed to advancing cardiovascular ultrasound to improve lives. ASE membership is open to all with an interest in echocardiography.  ASE History  Dr. Harvey Feigenbaum has reported that his impetus to start ASE in 1975 was to combat the skepticism cardiac ultrasound faced from the medical community. He reported that ‚Äúas late as 1971 there was still considerable skepticism as to whether ultrasound was a useful technique for the detection of pericardial effusion.‚Äù The organization was established ‚Äúto promote, maintain, and pursue excellence in the ultrasonic examination of the heart.‚Äù Since that time echocardiography has become a gold standard in cardiac care and has been increasingly adopted by an array of health practitioners to care for patients. In contrast to many other medical societies that are formed to support a particular constituency of members, ASE was established to push a scientific technique forward and influence the medical and research community to develop its application. In 2008, the Society established a standalone association structure, moving to self-management after 24 years of retaining an outside management firm.  ASE's Mission  To advance cardiovascular ultrasound and improve lives through excellence in education, research, innovation, advocacy, and service to the profession and the public.  2020-2025 ASE Strategic Goals  # ASE effectively develops strategic partnerships and funding opportunities to support guidelines and research in cardiovascular ultrasound. # ASE is the leader in meeting the educational needs of the cardiovascular ultrasound community. # ASE is indispensable for the development of any new cardiovascular ultrasound technology and applications. # ASE is a growing organization and recognized as the world's leading voice in cardiovascular ultrasound. # ASE embraces and advocates for all cardiovascular ultrasound users.  Board of Directors  ASE has Board of Directors composed of 20 voting members who are cardiovascular ultrasound specialists. These individuals are elected to the Board by a nominations process, open to all voting members and ratified by the membership of the organization. Individuals elected to the Board serve for two years.

Connect@ASE Member can participate in the global conversation on ASE's networking platform, Connect@ASE. This members-only site is the host for ASE's active discussion forums, an image library, containing hundreds of moving images, and ASE's enhanced member directory to connect with colleagues.  ASE Guideline Documents  The ASE guidelines have become an essential and integral part of the practice of echocardiography. As echocardiographic technology and utilization continue to advance, an overwhelming amount of new information is being generated, requiring organized analysis, synthesis, and conversion into specific recommendations. The contents of a guideline are based on systematic evaluation of best available evidence as well as expert consensus. ASE guidelines are designed to support decision-making in the use of echocardiography as an imaging modality. Ideally, the guidelines will reduce inappropriate variation in practice, provide a focus for continuing education, highlight limitations of existing literature, and provide direction for future research. To date, ASE currently has 79 guidelines in publication and translated guidelines into eight languages.  Publications  JASE The Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography(JASE) brings physicians and sonographers peer-reviewed original investigations and state-of-the-art review articles that cover conventional clinical applications of cardiovascular ultrasound, as well as newer techniques with emerging clinical applications. These include three-dimensional echocardiography, strain and strain rate methods for evaluating cardiac mechanics and interventional applications. The current editor of JASE is Michael Picard, MD, FASE. In 1987, the Society decided to publish the Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (JASE), a scientific journal devoted solely to echocardiography, and have the publication owned by the Society. The Mosby Company was selected as publisher, and 1988 was the first year of publication for the bimonthly journal. Dr. Harvey Feigenbaum was appointed the first Editor-in-Chief of JASE and served for 20 years in that role. In the late 1990s, Mosby morphed into Elsevier, and the Journal became a monthly publication in 1998. Dr. Alan S. Pearlman was appointed the Journal's second Editor in- Chief in 2008 and helped to usher JASE into the digital age. He served until 2018. The Journal has attained recognition in the medical publishing field and is now ranked in the top 25% of all cardiology journals and was chosen by cardiologists as a ‚ÄúTop Ten Essential Journal‚Äù in their practice of medicine. CASE CASE, an international cardiovascular imaging case reports journal, is a companion title to the highly regarded Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (JASE). It is committed to encouraging excellence in cardiovascular ultrasound worldwide and its application to patient care. This journal supports the mission of the American Society of Echocardiography by publishing peer-reviewed case reports that make teaching points or scientific observations about echocardiography in the clinical setting. Echo Magazine A Member News Source for ASE currently in its ninth volume.  Advocacy  The American Society of Echocardiography's mission in advocacy is to represent the interests of our members, while advocating to create an environment for excellence in the quality and practice of cardiovascular ultrasound. ASE is the only organization that is advocating exclusively on echocardiography-related issues to Congress, federal agencies, and among private payers is unquestionably of great‚Äìand ever-increasing‚Äì importance. Current ASE Advocacy Priorities include: * ASE works to ensure quality health care that is safe, effective, and timely * Protect and defend member's ability to practice medicine and deliver the highest quality of care * ASE strives for adequate coverage for the resources required for need patient care  ASE Policy Statements  ASE Board-approved policy statements highlight the scope of issues being addressed in cardiovascular ultrasound. New policies are initially distributed to ASE members via the official journal, JASE, and then posted on the ASE website. Policies have been reviewed that are over ten years and have been phased out should they be contradictory in nature with new policies or not relevant to Society current practices.  ASE Accreditation  ASE has been accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) since 2014 to provide continuing medical education (CME) for physicians. ASE is committed to ensuring that its educational mission and all sponsored educational programs are not influenced by the special interests of any corporation or individual, and its mandate is to retain only those speakers whose financial interests can be effectively resolved to maintain the goals and educational integrity of its programs. While a monetary or professional affiliation with a corporation does not necessarily influence a presentation, the ACCME's Essential Areas, Criteria, and Policies require that any relationship that could possibly conflict with the educational value of a program be resolved prior to the educational session and disclosed to the audience. In accordance with these policies, ASE implements mechanisms prior to the planning and implementation of CME activities to identify and resolve conflicts of interest for all individuals in a position to control content.  ASE Learning Hub  ASE has an online education portal, ASE Learning Hub, which houses CME and non-CME resources for the cardiovascular community. It also houses an online store with educational products and resources for the lab such as text books, guideline posters, and more.  ASE Live Courses  The organization's growth flourished by creating training and education resources for the field's practitioners. The inaugural Scientific Sessions was held in Washington, DC in 1990. Over time the organization has added additional live meetings to meet its members‚Äô educational needs. Until 2000, the organization just planned the review course for studying for the NBE's exam, but now hosts five annual courses: Echo Hawaii, State-of-the-Art Echocardiography, ASCeXAM Review Course, Echo Florida, and the Annual Scientific Sessions. In addition, ASE co-sponsors and endorses live courses around the world including in India, Hong Kong, and Brazil to meet the demand for quality cardiovascular ultrasound education worldwide. ASE Annual Scientific Sessions: ASE's Scientific Sessions are the premier international conference devoted specifically to cardiovascular ultrasound in clinical patient care. It is a vital event for practicing echocardiographers and offers a full spectrum of educational events including symposia discussing novice, intermediate, and advanced techniques. Research featuring leading cardiovascular ultrasound experts is also highlighted. The program is an opportunity for all interested healthcare practitioners to explore contemporary issues and emerging developments in the field of cardiovascular ultrasound. All levels of practitioners will find sessions that meet their needs, help improve their practice, and benefit their professional growth. Echo Hawaii: Echo Hawaii presents the latest information on established and emerging cardiovascular ultrasound technologies. Expert U.S. and international faculty discuss state-of-the-art technologies with a particular focus on how they can be effectively applied in the clinical setting. Case-based approaches are used to discuss new and established uses of echocardiography for diagnosis and guiding management in patients with a broad array of cardiovascular conditions. Topics include: advanced assessment of systolic and diastolic function, 3D/4D imaging, adult congenital heart disease, and contemporary approaches to valve disease, guidance of interventional procedures, contrast echocardiography, ischemic heart disease, and aortic pathology. Special sessions include workshops on perioperative and critical care and 3D echocardiography. State-of-the-Art Echocardiography: State-of-the-Art Echocardiography is a premier educational venue for echocardiography in clinical practice. More than 100 cases will be used to show strain imaging, 3D echocardiography, valve disease, and intervention. Expert faculty will lead a percutaneous workshop with an in-depth exploration of the use of echocardiographic imaging in valve disease. An echo quiz, coverage of the new guidelines, and casebased learning round out this superbly rated meeting that is filled to capacity year after year. Participants should have practical knowledge of echocardiography in order to benefit fully from this program. ASCeXAM/ReASCE Review Course: ASE has specifically designed the ASCeXAM/ReASCE Review Course as a preparatory course for the National Board of Echocardiography‚ÄôsTM (NBE) ASCeXAM¬Æ and ReASCE¬Æ examinations. Lectures emphasize illustrative cases and as such will not be ‚Äúcanned talks‚Äù from other cardiovascular ultrasound courses. The Review Course covers all aspects of cardiovascular ultrasound essential to these examinations, including physics, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, congenital heart disease, and new technologies. The expert faculty uses case studies, lectures, and interactive sessions to help prepare the attendees for the ASCeXAM¬Æ or ReASCE¬Æ. Practice board exam questions after each session will facilitate faculty interaction and self-guided learning. The ASCeXAM/ReASCE Review Course has been designed with the computer-based examination administration in mind. There is case-based learning and use of an audience response system to simulate a digital, multiple choice examination. CME from this course is ‚Äúecho-specific‚Äù and therefore appropriate for IAC Accreditation and NBE education prerequisites. Echo Florida: The Echo Florida course is a comprehensive review of cardiovascular ultrasound in clinical practice. The faculty is composed of U.S. and international experts who will discuss the strengths and limitations of established and emerging technologies and illustrate how these technologies can be used to improve and streamline patient care in a cost-conscious manner. There is a heavy emphasis on case- based learning. This course is designed for adult and pediatric cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, cardiac radiologists, fellows in training, cardiovascular sonographers, cardiovascular nurse specialists, internists, intensivists, and emergency physicians with special interest in clinical cardiology and echocardiography. Topics include: coronary artery disease including stress testing, valvular heart disease, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), and cardiomyopathy, emerging technologies including contrast and 3D/4D echocardiography, complex congenital heart disease, and case-based demonstrations on the role of 2D and real time 3D/4D echocardiography to select, guide, and follow percutaneous structural heart disease interventions, replacement, and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

ASE's influence abroad correspondingly grew. Although ASE's membership has always been open to anyone with an interest in echo, based anywhere in the world, international membership started to take off and grew from approximately 1,300 in 2005 to over 2,800 today (over 15% of ASE members). Now over 40% of the research abstracts for the Scientific Sessions originate from outside the United States. The organization launched the ASE International Alliance Partners program, which has been developed to create a pathway for collaborations and shared resources among participating membership-based echocardiography/cardiology societies. This program is open to established and recognized specialty or sub-specialty organizations based outside the United States that endorse the practice of cardiovascular ultrasound. Sections, working groups, or councils of societies that focus on the use of cardiovascular ultrasound outside the US may also be recognized as participants. * ASE International Alliance Partners * ASE 2020 Updates from ASE's International Alliance Partners  ASE Foundation  The ASE Foundation is ASE's charitable arm, helping to assure the viability and visibility of cardiovascular ultrasound. The Foundation was created in 2003 to fund initiatives, like scholarships and guidelines-based projects, not supported by membership dues. The scope and success of these projects are completely dependent on donor giving. To secure the funding needed to realize these goals, we look to ASE members, the greater community of health care providers, corporate and industry partners, and other foundations. Each year we establish a fundraising goal and embark on an Annual Appeal to achieve it. Monies raised through the Annual Appeal support Global Health Outreach, Patient Engagement, Research, and Travel Grants and Scholarships. The Foundation awards travel grants, scholarships, and has completed 17 global outreach events in 9 countries. Together, ASE and the Foundation have allocated over $6 million to support echocardiographic research activities since 1996.

Historically, it was one of the most abundant skates in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its name, today it appears to be absent from much of this range. Where previously abundant, fisheries directly targeted this skate and elsewhere it is caught incidentally as bycatch. The species was uplisted to critically endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2006 and it is protected within the EU.ICES (11 October 2016)5.3.12 Common skate (Dipturus batis-complex (blue skate (Dipturus batis) and flapper skate (Dipturus cf. intermedia)) in subareas 6‚Äì7 (excluding Division 7.d) (Celtic Seas and western English Channel) .

Journal of Fish Biology 80: 901‚Äì917. Alternatively, the scientific name D. batis (with flossada as a synonym) is retained for the blue skate and D. intermedius for the flapper skate. Description The common skate can reach up to in length, in width, and in weight, making it the largest skate in the world. Overall shape features a pointed snout and rhombic shape, with a row of spines or thorns along the tail. The top surface is generally coloured olive-grey to brown, often with a pattern of spots, and the underside is lighter blue-grey. It can be confused with several other skates in its range, such as D. nidarosiensis, D. oxyrinchus, and Rostroraja alba. Range, habitat, and ecology The common skate is native to the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Historically, the species ranged from Iceland and northern Norway to Madeira and northern Morocco. It is a bottom dwelling species mainly found at depths of , but it can occur as shallow as and as deep as . They are found in those depths at the waters off northwestern Scotland and in the Celtic Sea, and along the edge of the continental shelf. At the start of the twentieth century common skates had a wide range around the British Isles. Now, their population and range are severely depleted and fragmented, with disappearances being reported on several places. Growth and reproduction The common skate can reach an estimated age of 50‚Äì100 years and maturity is reached when about 11 years old. The size where they reach maturity depend on sex and population. In D. cf. flossada (blue skate) males reach maturity when about long and females when about long.ICES (October 2012). . Retrieved 31 December 2017. In D. cf. intermedia (flapper skate), males reach maturity when about long and females when about long. The sex ratio is 1:1, but this can vary depending on geography and season. When hatching, juveniles measure up to long. Once they have reached sexual maturity, they only reproduce every other year. They mate in the spring, and during the summer, females lay about 40 egg cases in sandy or muddy flats. The eggs develop for 2‚Äì5 months before hatching. Egg case Egg cases measure up to long, excluding the horns, and wide. They are covered in close-felted fibers and often wash up on the shore. Egg case hunts have been done throughout the general distribution of the common skate. In the British Isles, egg cases were only found in northern Scotland and the north of Ireland. In the 19th and 20th centuries, egg cases were seen along the entire British coastline in high numbers, but now they are only found in a few areas. Diet Like other skates, the common skate is a bottom feeder. Its diet consists of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as sand eel, flatfish, monkfish, catsharks, spurdog, and other skates). The size of the individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is, the more food will be needed to sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is, the more it eats. The common skate does not only feed on creatures at the bottom of the ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey. Threatened status The common skate is listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN and it is threatened both in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The common skate's population has drastically decreased because of overfishing and it likely will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It has both been targeted directly and caught incidentally as bycatch. Due to the profitability of trawl fishing, bycatch likely will remain a serious problem for the common skate. The species is extirpated in the Baltic Sea. Remaining strongholds where it remains locally common are off western Scotland and in the Celtic Sea.ICES (2017). . Retrieved 31 December 2017. A stronghold along the coast of Norway has been suggested, but recent studies indicate the species is rare there and many previous records are the result of misidentifications of other skates. Because the common skate is long-lived and slow to mature, it may be slow to repopulate, but experience with the related barndoor skate (D. laevis) of the northwest Atlantic indicates that a population recovery may be possible in a relatively short time. The common skate is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other elasmobranchs, it is believed to have a good chance of surviving if released after being caught. Taxonomy Distinct genetic and morphological differences exist within the common skate as traditionally defined, leading to the recommendation of splitting it into two species: The smaller (up to about in length) southern D. cf. flossada (blue skate), and the larger and slower- growing northern D. cf. intermedius (flapper skate). Under this taxonomic arrangement, the name D. batis is discarded. Alternatively, the scientific name D. batis (with flossada as a synonym) is retained for the blue skate and D. intermedius for the flapper skate. A formal request of preserving the name D. batis (with flossada as a synonym) for the blue skate has been submitted to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, but as of 2017 a decision is still pending. Based on molecular phylogenetics, D. cf. intermedius is very close to D. oxyrinchus, while the relationship to D. cf. flossada is more distant. D. cf. intermedius has dark olive-green eyes and the blotch on each wing consists of a group of pale spots. D. cf. flossada has pale yellow eyes, and the blotch on each wing is relatively large, roughly round, dark and with a pale ring around it. Additional differences between the two are found in the thorns on their tails and other morphometric features. Both are found around the British Isles, and their ranges broadly overlap in the seas around this archipelago, but D. cf. intermedius is the most frequent species in the northern half (off Scotland and Northern Ireland), and D. cf. flossada is the most frequent in the southwest (Celtic Sea) and at Rockall.ICES (October 2012). . Retrieved 31 December 2017. The primary‚Äîpossibly only‚Äîspecies in Iceland is D. cf. flossada based mainly on the ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey and zoological specimens, the species off Norway is D. cf. intermedius (no confirmed records of D. cf. flossada, but it might occur), and based on limited data the main in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat is D. cf. intermedius (although at least one record of D. cf. flossada in this region, off west Sweden, has been reported).ICES (9 October 2015). . Retrieved 31 December 2017. Uncertainty exists about the exact species involved in the southern half of the range, but a preliminary morphological study indicates that the one in the Azores is D. cf. intermedius.

Tusket Township Courthouse and Gaol, the oldest extant in Canada History \\"Neketaouksit\\", the Mi'kmaq word for the \\"Great Forked Tidal River\\", evolved to what is now called Tusket. The village was originally settled by Acadians before the British launched the Cape Sable Campaign. Afterward the community was also settled by Dutch United Empire Loyalists from New York and New Jersey in 1785, after the Great Expulsion. In the 19th century the village was very prosperous as a major ship building centre. In 1801, the town rescued those who remained from the ship wreck of the Industry, after drifting in lifeboats for 5 days in the Bay of Fundy.Naval Chronicle. The Old Tusket Courthouse, built in 1805 and featuring a bell tower, is the oldest standing courthouse in Canada. The first Nova Scotian to die in aerial combat in World War II was from Tusket (Jack Elmer Hatfield, No. 264 Squadron RAF). The French-speaking high school √âcole secondaire de Par-en-Bas is located in the community. The Universit√© Sainte-Anne has a campus located in Tusket as well, in order to serve the Acadian community in surrounding areas. There are many places, past and present, which use the word Tusket: Tusket ( the village itself), Tusket River, Tusket Falls, Tusket Islands, Tusket Hill (present-day Amiraults Hill), Tusket Wedge (present-day Wedgeport), Tusket Forks (present-day Quinan) and villages that used to be called Upper Tusket and Lower Tusket. Present day Tusket is at the head of the Tusket River estuary, where high tide salt water meets the fresh water flow of the Tusket River. The Tusket River and Basin presents a 32 kilometre wide basin with a very irregular 500 kilometre coastline. Points, peninsulas, ridges and islands are separated by tidal channels, inlets, estuaries, bays, salt marshes and tidal flats. The salt marshes are unique since they encompass 8000 acres, or one third the total acreage of natural salt marsh in the province. They are highly productive and play an important role in the ecology of our coastline and the off-shore waters. They also played a major role in the settlement of the Tusket Basin by the Acadian people. The Acadians made drainage ditches on the natural salt water marshes to be able to harvest the hay growing there. They were renowned for the construction of dykes and aboiteaux to produce hay- lands. Hay stacks are still visible today, in our region. One such aboiteau can be viewed at the West Pubnico Acadian Museum in West Pubnico, Nova Scotia. It was discovered and retrieved from a local salt marsh. These waters are laden with nutrients, after having filtered through 32 kilometres of river, and tons of dead plant matter and grasses. The Mi'kmaq, who lived inland, travelled by canoe down the Tusket River to the sea. They depended, seasonally, on the availability of some staples. They harvested seals, sea bird eggs, cod, shellfish, smelts, gaspereau, sturgeon, salmon, eels, tomcod, waterfowl, beaver, otter, rabbits, deer, moose, caribou and bear. All of these still inhabit the Tusket River system, except for the caribou.

It deals with the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict through Hare's own 1997 journey through Israel and Palestine, and the 33 people whom he met. Hare premiered the work in London in September 1998, in his solo acting debut, in collaboration with director Stephen Daldry and set designer Ian McNeil. The first US performance was on 18 March 1999, again with Daldry as director. Excerpts of the play were released on CD. The work was later produced for television. Hare performed the work again in July 2002 at the Duchess Theatre, London. In the context of this play, Daldry has characterized Hare's attitude to the Israel‚ÄìPalestine conflict as follows: > What David Hare is unneutral about‚Äîwhat he's deeply against‚Äîis extremism. > Here it's the extremism he found, and brilliantly acts out, between warring > political-philosophical-religious diehards within each populace, Israeli and > Palestinian alike‚Äî'people who seek religious justification for excessive > behavior on either side.' Hare received the 1999 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for his performance of Via Dolorosa. In May 1999, Steven Greenstein filed a US civil complaint against the Royal Court Theatre that alleged that Via Dolorosa had unlawfully taken ideas for the text and structure from an unproduced play by Greenstein, Voices from the Holy...and Not So Holy Land. The lawsuit did not name Hare specifically. In April 2000, Judge Denny Chin of the Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit and asserted that the plays by Greenstein and Hare were separate entities.

The Frankfurter Judengasse (\\"Jews' Lane\\" in German) was the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt and one of the earliest ghettos in Germany. It existed from 1462 until 1811 and was home to Germany's largest Jewish community in early modern times. At the end of the 19th century, most of the buildings in the Judengasse were demolished. The area suffered major destruction during World War II and reconstruction left no visible signs of the ghetto in today's townscape of Frankfurt. Post-war usage of the area included a car park, a petrol station and a wholesale flower market. The decision to build an administrative complex triggered a public discussion as to what should be done with the archaeological remains uncovered during the excavation in 1977. The foundations of 19 buildings were found and five of these can be seen at the \\"Museum Judengasse\\" which was incorporated into the new building. Location Part of Staufenmauer at Fahrgasse. The ghetto was located outside the city walls east of the medieval city wall (Staufenmauer) and formed a slight curve from today's Konstablerwache to B√∂rneplatz, near the river Main. The street was about 330 meters long, three to four meters wide, and had three town gates. The gates were locked at night as well as on Sundays and Christian holidays. Due to the narrow street and the limited access, the Judengasse was destroyed three times by fire in the 18th century alone, in 1711, 1721 and 1796. Initially, some 15 families with about 110 members lived in Frankfurt's Judengasse when they were forcibly removed from the city and relocated to the ghetto by decree of Frederick III in 1462. By the 16th century, the number of inhabitants rose to over 3,000, living in 195 houses. The ghetto had one of the highest population densities in Europe. Contemporary documents described it as narrow, oppressive and dirty. History before the creation of the Ghetto It is likely that Jews were amongst the earliest inhabitants of Frankfurt. On January 18, 1074, Henry IV granted the citizens and Jews of Worms, the ShUM-cities and other locations, including Frankfurt, certain privileges relating to reductions in fees and import duties. Eighty years later the Mainz based Rabbi Elieser ben Nathan (who died between 1145 and 1152) mentioned the Jewish community in Frankfurt in his book Eben ha Eser. Most likely the community was still very small at this point. Until the Late Middle Ages, the Frankfurt Jews lived in the present-day old city, between the Saint Bartholomew's Cathedral, Fahrgasse and the Main River. This prosperous section of the city was also the center of political life in Frankfurt. The town hall, the mint and a mansion of the Archbishop of Mainz were located in this area. During this time the Frankfurt Jews were allowed to travel throughout the city, which was an unusual freedom in the Holy Roman Empire. Additionally, many non-Jews lived in the Jewish section of town. The first Judenschlacht of 1241 In May 1241, a pogrom, known as the Judenschlacht (from the German; Slaughter of the Jews) took place in Frankfurt, brought on by conflicts over Jewish-Christian marriages and the enforced baptism of children of such marriages. The Erfurt Dominican Friars recorded that a few Christians and 180 Jews died during the pogrom. It also records that 24 Jews avoided death by accepting baptism, while under the protection of the city fathers. During the attacks, the synagogue was plundered and the Torah scrolls were destroyed. All of this occurred despite the fact that the Jews had been protected by the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II since 1236, and had a royal appointee running much of the city government. A few Hebrew sources discuss the pogrom as well. One source, a legalistic (halakha) discussion of the status of one of the captured women who eventually returned to the Jewish community, is Resp. Or Zarua (by Isaac ben Moses of Vienna), vol. 1, section 747 (see also the response by his son, Resp. Haim Or Zarua, 221). Three known elegies (piyyutim) relate to the Frankfurt event: one was signed by R. Shmuel b. Avraham HaLevi; the second is of anonymous authorship, appearing in Mahzor Saloniki; and the third has been attributed to R. Yehudah b. Moshe HaKohen. see: Rachel Furst, Captivity, conversion, and communal identity: sexual angst and religious crisis in Frankfurt, 1241, Jewish History (2008) 22: 179-221. DOI: 10.1007/s10835-007-9055-2 It seems possible that the Judenschlacht was organized rather than spontaneous. One reason presented is that the fighting lasted more than a day. Secondly, a fortified tower where 70 Jews had taken refuge was captured. Finally, a Jewish dirge records that archers attacked a rabbi and his pupils in their school. All three events imply a measure of planning and the presence of soldiers or a strong militia. Exactly who may have been responsible for the Judenschlacht is unclear owing to the scarcity of sources. The theory that it was led by the Dominican Friars, who had a papal order to fight heresy, is questionable. Another theory is that the pogrom was actually an attack against the Staufer royal family, led by Frederick II. Frederick II ordered an investigation into the Judenschlacht that lasted some years. In 1246 Conrad IV, on behalf of his father Frederick II, issued a document pardoning the citizens of Frankfurt. It declared a pardon without payment on damages because the pogrom occurred, \\"from carelessness rather than deliberation.\\" The general pardon is an example of the weak political power of the Staufer dynasty in Frankfurt. The second Judenschlacht of 1349  By the 14th century, Frankfurt was granted the status of a Free Imperial City by the Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian and Charles IV. As a Free Imperial City, Frankfurt was only responsible to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to local princes. The city operated as a virtual City-state with limited control from the Emperor. This new wealth and freedom led to the total domination of city government by a few wealthy patricians. In the mid-14th century, renewed violence was directed against the Frankfurt Jews. Ludwig the Bavarian (Luis IV) arrested some members of the Jewish community for alleged crimes. Reacting to the arrests, many local Jews fled the city. The Frankfurt Jews had paid a special tax to the Emperor for his protection and support. When a large number fled the city, he lost a source of income. To make up for this loss, he confiscated houses of those who had fled and sold them to the city of Frankfurt. Those who returned to the city were allowed by the Emperor to negotiate with the city of Frankfurt to repurchase their belongings. In June 1349 the Emperor Charles IV transferred the special Jewish Tax to the city of Frankfurt for 15,200 pounds. The responsibility for protecting the Jewish population thereby shifted from the Imperial Representative to the town council of Frankfurt. Technically, the Frankfurt Jews were no longer subjects of the Emperor but of the city council. Nevertheless, the Emperors maintained an interest in the Jewish population until the end of the Empire. The Frankfurt Jews were promised, by the Emperor and his descendants, the right to administer their own homes, cemeteries, synagogues and all the easements. In view of the growing number of pogroms ‚Äî Jews were held responsible for the Black Plague in 1348 ‚Äî the Emperor included a statement in the promise that turned out to be fatal. The Emperor stated that Frankfurt would not be held responsible if the Jews were killed as a result of sickness or riots. It also stated that the belongings of the deceased would revert to the city. Two weeks after the Emperor left the city, on July 24, 1349, all the Jews of Frankfurt were beaten to death or burnt as their houses were set aflame. The exact number of victims is unknown, but is estimated to have been 60. In older historical sources, fanatic flagellants are believed to be responsible for initiating the murders as a response to the plague. However, modern research questions this. Charles IV appears to have given the city of Frankfurt tacit approval for the pogrom, as mentioned above. Additionally, the plague did not reach Frankfurt until autumn 1349. It appears that some local leaders saw the loss of imperial protection as an opportunity to clear their debts and acquire new property. The church yard of St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Cathedral, for instance, was expanded into what had been Jewish property. The reestablishment of the Jewish community In 1360 the Emperor again granted the right for a Jewish settlement in Frankfurt. The Emperor claimed the right to taxes raised from the newly resettled population. The right to half the taxes was then sold to the Archbishop of Mainz, who then sold the rights to Frankfurt. An Imperial representative was sent to Frankfurt to collect the taxes and safeguard the rights of the Jews. In 1372 the city purchased the office from the Emperor for 6,000 marks. This put the control of Jewish taxes back to the city. By the end of 14th century, the Jewish community had grown large enough to establish a new synagogue, where the Jews participated in services, conducted business, swore judicial oaths, and heard proclamations from the emperor or the town council. Following the service, the rabbi would collect owed taxes and dispense punishments for minor offenses. Recent archeological excavations have revealed a 5.6 square meter (60 sq. ft.) area under the synagogue. This area was deep enough to reach the underground water level and most likely served as a mikvah, or ritual bath. The largest area of Jewish owned property in the city was the cemetery. The cemetery had been used since about 1270 and is first mentioned in a purchase document from 1300. Until 1333 when Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian expanded the city, the cemetery lay outside the city walls. It bordered on some gardens of Saint Bartholomew's Cathedral and was walled very early in its history. In 1349, during a Succession Crisis for the Holy Roman Emperor, the city of Frankfurt declared for G√ºnther von Schwarzburg against Charles IV. When they expected an attack from Charles, the Jewish Cemetery was fortified with eleven oriel windows. Later, in 1388 during a war between Swabia and the Salzburg Archbishop, the cemetery was again fortified.

Before the slaughter of the Jewish community in 1349, Frankfurt's Jews were listed in its Burgerlisten (German, lit. \\"Citizens List\\", a list of people who lived in the city and were granted any rights and privileges due to that city). However, the second community, rebuilt in 1360, had a different and lower status. Each individual had to individually negotiate an agreement with the town council which included how long they would stay in the city, the amount of tribute they would pay and the regulations they must follow. In 1366 Emperor Charles IV instructed his representative Siegfried to prevent Jews from becoming guild masters, from setting their own laws or holding their own courts. In 1424 the town council collected all the individual regulations into der Juden stedikeit (the Jewish regulations). The regulations were read each year in the synagogue. Crisis and growth of the community in the 15th century In the 14th century, Frankfurt lacked a powerful mercantile upper class. Despite the fair, which already existed, trade was less established in Frankfurt than in other German cities. Therefore, many Frankfurt Jews worked as bankers and provided loans to craftsmen, farmers, and nobles from the area surrounding Frankfurt. As a side business, they often bought and sold pawned goods. This led to a small trade in horses, wine, and grain as well as cloth, dresses, and jewelry. Because of the limited market, these enterprises remained small. Based on the amount of tax paid by the Frankfurt Jews, the wealth of the community was inferior to that of the Jewish communities in Nuremberg, Erfurt, Mainz or Regensburg. At the end of the 14th century, the Frankfurt Jews were subject to increased restrictions. Legislation of 1386 forbade the employment of Christians and restricted the number of Jewish servants in a household. A general \\"Jewish Debt Amnesty\\" issued by Emperor Wenceslaus essentially disowned the Jewish money lenders to the benefit of their Christian debtors. At the same time, the town council used a rigid new tax law to restrict the growth of the community. Between 1412 and 1416, the number of Jewish households dropped from about 27 to about 4. In 1422 the town council rejected the imperial Heretics Tax, claiming that only they had the right to tax the Frankfurt Jews. This action, which the Jewish population had little influence over, caused the entire population to be placed under an Imperial Edict and forced them to flee Frankfurt to avoid punishment. Only in 1424 were they allowed to return after the Emperor acknowledged that the Frankfurt Council was correct in rejecting the Heretics Tax. The Jewish population reached its lowest point in 1416 and then grew continuously. In the second half of the 15th century, Frankfurt's Jews provided an increasingly substantial tax revenue. Following the expulsion of the Jews from Trier (1418), Vienna (1420), Cologne (1424), Augsburg (1438), Breslau (1453), Magdeburg (1493), Nuremberg (1499), and Regensburg (1519), Frankfurt gained importance as a financial center. One reason for this was that the city council allowed only the most prosperous Jews to settle in the city. During the 15th century, the guilds, facing competition from the Jewish traders, were able to increase restrictions on the Jews. Nevertheless, when Emperor Maximilian assessed a tax on the Jewish communities to pay for his Italian Campaign in 1497, Frankfurt's contribution was second only to that of the city of Worms. The Frankfurt Ghetto Frankfurt city map 1628, showing the curved Judengasse. Leading up to the Ghetto By 1431 the town council considered options for dealing with the Jews. Since the town was often in conflict with either the emperor or the Archbishop of Mainz over the Jewish population, this had become a pressing issue. The council debated the creation of a ghetto in both 1432 and 1438 without reaching a conclusion. In 1442 the Emperor Frederick III ordered the resettlement of all Jews living near the cathedral, as the singing in the synagogue was disturbing the Christian services in the cathedral. Then, in 1446 a murder occurred on a Jew known as zum Buchsbaum. The town council secretary recorded this in his book with three crosses, the notation Te Deum laudamus (Latin God be praised) and Crist ist entstanden (German ‚ÄúChrist is risen‚Äù).Quoted from the original German, Konrad Bund, Frankfurt am Main im Sp√§tmittelalter 1311‚Äì1519, in: Frankfurter Historische Kommission (Hrg.): Frankfurt am Main ‚Äì Die Geschichte der Stadt in neun Beitr√§gen. Sigmaringen 1991. Jan Thorbecke Verlag, , S. 134 In 1452 Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa visited the city to encourage the town council to enforce the Church Dress Order. That demanded, that female Jews wear a blue veil and all males wear yellow rings on their sleeves. However, adherence to these regulations was enforced only for a short time. Construction of the Ghetto After another order from the Emperor Frederick III, in 1458, the council finally began building houses outside the city wall and moat. In 1462 the Jews were forced to relocate into these houses. This was the beginning of the isolated and closed off ghetto. In 1464 the city established eleven houses, one dance hall, two pubs, and a community center at its own expense. The cold bath and synagogue were built by the Jewish community. This first ghetto synagogue, known as the Altschul (German ‚Äúold school‚Äù), was built on the east side of the Judengasse. As any synagogue, this was used for more than just religious services. It was also the social center of the community where members could carry out many everyday activities. This close connection between religious and everyday life was common in ghetto life. The creation of the ghetto and the corresponding isolation created a sense of self-sufficiency in the Jewish community. Within the synagogue Jewish leaders were selected, regulations from the Rabbis were issued, bankruptcies were declared and corporal punishments were carried out. The seats in the synagogue could be rented by members of the community and were auctioned off if fees were owed. In 1465 the city council decided that the cost of further construction on the Judengasse would be left to the Jewish community. It was now possible, in 1471, to pave the road, build a second well and a warm bath. The city council maintained the rights to the land and to any houses erected, regardless of who had built them. For any developed plot within the ghetto, the city received a rent from the owner. Within the next century, the ghetto's population grew until the original houses were no longer sufficient. The Jews were then allowed to expand the ghetto into the city moat. Following the expansions of 1552 and 1579, the Judengasse would remain virtually unchanged until the 19th century. During the economic growth at the end of the 14th century, the Jewish population increased from 260 in 1543 to about 2,700 in 1613. As the Judengasse could not be enlarged, new houses were created by dividing existing houses. Also, on both sides of the lane, backrows of dwellings were built, so that there were four rows of houses in the ghetto. Finally, additional stories were added to the dwellings and the upper stories were built forward over the lane until they nearly touched each other. On lower houses, large‚Äîoften multi- story‚Äîmansard roofs were added to increase the available room. Life in the ghetto The ghetto remained a very crowded section of town owing to both rapid population growth and the refusal of Frankfurt's municipal authorities to allow the ghetto's area to expand. Virtually every facet of life was regulated by the council's regulations pertaining to the Jewish community. For example, Jews were not allowed to leave the ghetto during nights, Sundays, Christian holidays or during the election and coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor. In addition to isolating the Jews, these regulations included a number of arbitrary, restrictive and discriminatory rules. The laws regulated the right to live in the city, the collection of deliveries and the acceptable professions. Every Jew was required to wear a circular yellow mark on his or her clothes to identify as a Jew. Furthermore, the influx of Jews into Frankfurt was strictly limited. Altogether only 500 Jewish families were allowed to live on the Judengasse after a new set of regulations were issued in 1616. The Laws of 1616 also stated that only 12 weddings would be permitted per year in the Ghetto. Even wealthy and influential inhabitants, such as the banker Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), were not excluded from these Laws. The rabbinical conference of 1603 The Jewish community of Frankfurt was one of the most important in Germany in the 16th century. A Talmudic Academy had been established where the halakhic rabbis taught. Additionally, Kabbalahic works were printed in the ghetto. Whenever the Jewish communities of Germany collected money for the poor Jews in Palestine, the money was sent to Frankfurt for transferal. The central role of Frankfurt's Jews in Jewish spiritual life is best illustrated in the Rabbinical Conference held in Frankfurt in 1603. Many of the most important Jewish communities in Germany (including Mainz, Fulda, Cologne and Koblenz) sent representatives to Frankfurt for this conference. The conference dealt primarily with topics that the Jews had jurisdiction over, and for which five Courts of Justice existed. Some of these topics were: the fraud in trade and coinage, responsibilities to local authorities, religious questions and ritual regulations. However, the resolutions of the conference were declared treason in Germany. Emperor Rudolf II found that the resolutions of the Conference surpassed the privileges that he had granted. As a result, the Emperor's protection was withdrawn for some 25 years. Rebellions and pogroms resulted in several cities with a significant Jewish population. In 1631 a large fine was paid by the communities to the Archbishop of Cologne to settle the dispute. The Fettmilch Rising  Tensions between the patricians and the guilds led to the 1614 Fettmilch Rising,Hughes, Michael (1992). Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806, MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. 76. . named after its ringleader, Vincenz Fettmilch. During the riot, the Judengasse was attacked and looted, and the Jews were expelled from the city. The tension was caused by the demand of the guilds for greater participation in urban and fiscal policies. The guilds wanted a reduction in grain prices, as well as some anti-Jewish regulations, such as a limitation in the number of Jews and a 50% reduction in the interest rate that Jewish moneylenders could charge. Beside the guilds, merchants and independent craftsmen supported Fettmilch in the hope of annulling their debts by restricting the number of moneylenders. The plundering of the Judengasse, 22 August 1614. In late 1613, the Town Council reached an agreement with Fettmilch and his supporters. This granted the guilds increased power and rights. However, the population of Frankfurt then learned that the city had extensive debts and that the Town Council had misappropriated the Jewish Tax collected, Fettmilch declared the Council deposed and seized the city gates. Now the Emperor, who had been neutral, entered the conflict. He demanded a reinstatement of the Town Council and threatened anyone who opposed him with an Imperial Interdiction which would strip the offender of all rights. Once the rebellious craftsmen learned of the Imperial Interdiction, they took to the streets in protest. The mob directed its anger against the weakest member of the dispute, the Jews. They stormed the gates of the Judengasse which were defended by local Jews. After several hours of fighting at the barricades, the mob entered the ghetto. All inhabitants of the Judengasse, about 1,380 individuals, were driven into the Jewish Cemetery whilst their houses were plundered and partly destroyed. On the following day, the Jews were forced to leave the city. They found refuge in the surrounding communities, particularly Hanau, H√∂chst and Offenbach. On 28 September 1614, the Emperor issued a sentence against Fettmilch and his followers. On November 27, Fettmilch was arrested. He and 38 others were accused of disobedience and rebellion against the Emperor, but charged for their persecution of Jews. On February 28, 1616, Fettmilch and six others were executed on Frankfurt's Rossmarkt square. On the same day, 20 Adar by the Hebrew calendar, the Jews who had fled were led back into Frankfurt by Imperial soldiers. Above the gates to the Judengasse, a stone Imperial Eagle was added with an inscription reading ‚ÄúProtected by the Roman Imperial Majesty and the Holy Empire‚Äù. The first act of the returning Jews was returning the desecrated synagogue and devastated cemetery to religious use. The anniversary of the return was celebrated as Purim Vinz, after Fettmilch's first name.http://www.sehepunkte.historicum.net/2002/07/3792.html The Purim-Kaddisch includes a merry march which remembers the joyful return. However, the Jews never received the promised compensation for their losses. The Fettmilch Rebellion was one of the last pogroms in Germany, until the rise of the National Socialists. The rebellion is also remarkable, as for the first time most Christian commentators had supported the Jewish community in this dispute. The Jewish Code of Residence of 1616 As a reaction to the Fettmilch Rebellion, a new set of regulations were issued in 1616. However, these laws, originating with the Imperial Commissioners from Hessen and the Mainz palatinate (Kurmainz), were based largely on anti-Semitic attitudes and did little to support the rights of the Jewish community. The regulations determined that no more than 500 Jewish families live in Frankfurt. In the 60 years before the pogrom, the Jewish population had increased tenfold from 43 to 453. The law now put an upper limit on the growth that was allowed in the Jewish community. Jewish marriages were limited to 12 per year, whilst Christians had to prove only that their wealth allowed a marriage. In business the Jews were broadly granted the same rights that Christian non-citizen residents had. These non-citizen rights, which had evolved during the Middle Ages, excluded them from most types of business. All non-citizens were prevented from opening shops, operating retail business in the city, entering into business ventures with full citizens, or owning business property. One significant difference was that Jews were explicitly allowed to engage in wholesale businesses, trading commodities, such as grain, wine, cloth, silk, and other textiles. The Emperor may have allowed the Jews the wholesale business to weaken the powerful Christian traders, which had usurped the power the guilds had lost in the Fettmilch Rebellion. A result of the new laws was that the regulations were not to be renewed every three years and therefore constituted a permanent grant of residency. However, the Jews continued to be treated as an alien group, who had a lower status than citizens and non- citizen residents alike. They remained subjects of the Town Council and, unlike Christians, could not apply for citizenship. The Law of 1616 explicitly forbade the Jews from even calling themselves ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù. Finally, Jews paid more than other residents in extra tariffs and additional taxes. The Law of 1616 was revised several times, for example in 1660. Each revision improved the situation of the Jews. However, the Jewish Laws remained a medieval legal construct until the 19th century. The Great Ghetto Fire of 1711 Home of the Rothschild family, a major banking family in the ghetto. On January 14, 1711, one of the largest fires that ever occurred in Frankfurt broke out in the Judengasse. The fire started at about 8 p.m. in the House Eichel (German: Acorn) owned by the senior Rabbi Naphtali Cohen. The house was one of the largest in the ghetto, with a frontage of 9.5 meters (30 ft) and was located directly opposite to the synagogue. Strong winds and the density of the buildings spread the fire. Additionally, the timber-framed construction of houses, the general lack of fire walls and the corbelled upper floors allowed the fire to race through the ghetto. Out of fear of looting, the gates to the ghetto were locked. The neighboring Christians finally allowed the Jews to flee the burning ghetto when it appeared that the fire would spread if it could not be contained. Even with the additional firefighting help the residents were unable to save the ghetto. Within 24 hours every house had burned to the ground. Fortunately, the wind shifted before the fire could spread further. Four people lost their lives in the flames, and many valued objects were destroyed, including books, manuscripts and Torah scrolls. After the disaster, the inhabitants of the lane were allowed to rent houses in Christian Frankfurt until their homes were rebuilt. Those who could not afford the rent were forced to search for homes in surrounding Jewish communities. Jews who had lived in the ghetto without permission were expelled. The Jewish community of Frankfurt set the date of the fire (24 Tevet) as a memorial and fast day. The first concern of the Jewish community was the reconstruction of the destroyed synagogue. By the end of September 1711, they had finished the new building. It was constructed on the old foundations and consisted of three parts: the actual synagogue (Altschul), the three story women's synagogue to the north (which was partly separate from the synagogue) and the Neuschul or new synagogue to the south. The Altschul was built with many Gothic elements, including Gothic arches, an independent fa√ßade, columns, and a large rose window. Compared to other synagogues of the Baroque era (Prague, Amsterdam or Poland), this synagogue seemed backward and medieval. The architecture may have reflected the isolation of the ghetto. The town council required that all reconstruction in the lane follow strict building codes. The builders' drawings, collected and archived by the council, allow an excellent reconstruction of the old Judengasse. The Ghetto Fire of 1721 Only ten years later, a second fire broke out in the ghetto on January 28, 1721. Within eleven hours, the entire northern part of the lane was in flames. Over 100 houses burned down and some houses were looted and damaged by Christian inhabitants. Due to the damage and theft, Emperor Charles VI demanded that the town council punish the looters and better protect the Jewish community. After extensive negotiations, the council decided that repayment would occur but only in the annulment of taxes and fees owed. Reconstruction occurred very slowly because a majority of the community was impoverished by the previous disasters. Following the fire, a number of inhabitants left the ghetto to live in Frankfurt with Christian landlords. It was not until 1729 that the town council forced the last 45 families living in Frankfurt back into the ghetto. The Bombardment of 1796 The end of the Judengasse on 13‚Äì14 July 1796. In July 1796 French Revolutionary troops under Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber besieged Frankfurt. As the city was garrisoned with Austrian troops, Kl√©ber positioned his troops to attack the garrison. The French army's cannons were positioned north of the city between the Eschenheimer Gate and the All Saints Gate. Kl√©ber hoped to make the Austrian Commander von Wartensleben surrender by bombarding the city in the evening of July 12 and the afternoon of July 13. A further shelling throughout the night of July 13‚Äì14 caused extensive damage. The northern part of the Judengasse was hit and started to burn, destroying about a third of the houses. Following the damage to the entire city, the Austrian garrison was forced to surrender. Despite the extensive damage from the battle, the destruction had a benefit to the Jewish community. The bombardment led to the de facto abolishment of the ghetto. The end of the ghetto The Judengasse from the Ravenstein produced City Map (1861). Demolition of the Jewish Ghetto 1875, watercolor by Carl Theodor Reiffenstein. Frankfurt was one of the last cities in Europe to allow the Jews to leave the ghetto. The Frankfurt city council was generally anti-semitic. In 1769 the council responded to a Jewish petition to leave the ghetto on Sunday afternoons as ... an example of the unbounded arrogance of this people, who expend every effort to take all opportunities to set themselves up as equals to the Christian citizens. In 1779 the drama Nathan the Wise by Gotthold Lessing, a fervent plea for religious tolerance, was published. The Frankfurt town council immediately banned the book and any copies found were confiscated. Frankfurt's Jews intensely lobbied both the Emperor and the German Parliament in Regensburg for an improvement of their status, which had not changed significantly following the Patent of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II. However, the lobbying efforts of the Jews were in vain. Only the war between France and the coalition of Austria, England and Kingdom of Prussia brought liberty to the Jews. In 1806 the French appointed Grand Duke of Frankfurt Karl von Dalberg ordered that equal rights be granted to all religious creeds. One of his first acts was to repeal the old municipal law forbidding the Jews from walking on a main ring road, the Anlagen. When a new school was built for the Jewish community, the Philanthropin, he donated a large sum of money. Despite von Dalberg's efforts, Frankfurt issued a new set of Jewish regulations in 1807 that attempted to reestablish the ghetto. Finally in 1811 Dalberg's Highest Regulation, for the equality of civil right of the Jewish Municipality eliminated the requirements to live in the ghetto and abolished all special Jewish taxes. However, the Jewish community had to pay a lump sum of 440,000 Guilder. The Ghetto in the 19th and early 20th centuries The new Main Synagogue, c. 1860. The B√∂rneplatz Synagogue, c. 1890. Following the end of the Confederation of the Rhine and reestablishment of the Free City of Frankfurt in 1816, the Senate agreed upon a series of articles to the Constitution. Acknowledging the desires of the Christian majority, the rights of the Jews were again curtailed. However, the requirement to live in the Ghetto was not renewed. In 1864 Frankfurt became the second German city, following the Grand Duchy of Baden (1862), to remove all restrictions on citizens' rights and to grant civic equality to Jews. Due to the crowded and unsanitary conditions on the Judengasse most Jews had left the former ghetto during the 19th century and settled in the neighboring suburb, \\"Ostend\\". After the Jews had moved out of the Judengasse, the poor of Frankfurt moved in. Although the picturesque streetscape attracted tourists and painters, the city wanted to redevelop the urban area. So, in 1874 the desolate buildings on the west side of the street were razed. Then in 1884 nearly all the houses on the east side of the street were also demolished. The few remaining buildings included the Rothschild family home at Number 148, then used as a museum. Mayer Amschel Rothschild's widow, Gutele Rothschild (born Schnaper), lived in this house even after her five sons were elevated to nobility in 1817. By 1854 the Jewish community had torn down the old synagogue (built in 1711) to build a new synagogue in 1859 to 1860. The new synagogue would become the spiritual center of Reform Judaism in Frankfurt until it was destroyed during the Kristallnacht under the Nazis. Following the reconstruction, Judengasse was renamed after the most famous resident Ludwig B√∂rne as B√∂rnestra√üe and the old Judenmarkt (German: Jews' Market) was renamed B√∂rneplatz (German: Boerne Platz). The Orthodox Jews lived on B√∂rneplatz and had their own Synagogue, the B√∂rneplatz Synagogue. The Synagogue was built in 1882 and also destroyed in 1938 during the Kristallnacht. Following the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933 B√∂rnestra√üe was renamed Gro√üer Wollgraben and B√∂rneplatz became Dominikanerplatz after the Dominican Monastery on the west side. After the Nazis had removed nearly all of Frankfurt's Jews, the former Judengasse was totally destroyed during the bombing of Frankfurt during WWII. Remnants of the Ghetto Memorial to the 11,134 Frankfurt citizens killed during the Holocaust -Anne Frank's name is located in the center of the picture with a rock placed on her memorial. Following the destruction of World War II, the area was completely leveled and built over. From 1952 to 1955 roads were built including the Kurt-Schumacher-Stra√üe (named after Kurt Schumacher) and Berliner Stra√üe. B√∂rneplatz (which would not return to this name until 1978) became the location of the Blumengro√ümarkthalle (German: Flower wholesale market) which disappeared in the 1970s. B√∂rne Street was not rebuilt, which makes it nearly impossible to identify the Judengasse. The northern half of the current road An der Staufenmauer south of the Konstablerwache basically follows the northern end of B√∂rne Street and the former Judengasse. Along this road the last remnants of the old wall that made up the west side of the ghetto can be seen. The wide Kurt Schumacher Street cuts across a section of the former Judengasse at an angle and covers much of the former ghetto. The main synagogue is in Kurt Schumacher Street opposite to the junction of Allerheiligen Street. A memorial plaque on the synagogue indicates the location of Number 41 Judengasse. The south end of the Judengasse is under the Customer Service Center for the Frankfurt Public Utilities, which was built in 1990. This south end is accessible from the Museum Judengasse. Museum Judengasse In the 1980s, during the construction of the new Administration Building for the city's Public Utilities, portions of the Mikwe (ritual bath) and several foundations of Jewish houses were discovered. This led to a nationwide debate on the future of these remnants of Jewish culture. In 1992, the Museum Judengasse was opened in a carefully preserved basement underneath of the Administration Building. The museum displays the preserved foundations of a section of the ghetto, as well as some artifacts discovered in the construction. The museum is a branch office of the Jewish Museum Frankfurt. Near the museum, on Neuer B√∂rneplatz (German: New Boerne Platz), parts of the outline of the destroyed B√∂rneplatz synagogue have been marked on the pavement. Kristallnacht The main synagogue in Frankfurt destroyed on Kristallnacht Most of the synagogues in Frankfurt were severely damaged or destroyed by the Nazis on Kristallnacht. These included the synagogues at Alt Heddernheim 33,Alt Heddernheim 33, Synagogue Internet Archive B√∂rneplatz,B√∂rneplatz, Synagogue Internet Archive B√∂rnestra√üe,B√∂rnestra√üe, Synagogue Internet Archive Conrad-Weil-Gasse,Conrad-Weil-Gasse, Synagogue Internet Archive Freiherr-vom-Stein-Stra√üe,Freiherr-vom-Stein-Stra√üe , Synagogue Internet Archive Friedberger Anlage 5-6,Friedberger Anlage 5-6, Synagogue Internet Archive Hermesweg 5-7,Hermesweg 5-7, Synagogue Internet Archive Inselgasse 9,Inselgasse 9, Synagogue Internet Archive Marktplatz (Ortsteil H√∂chst),Marktplatz (Ortsteil H√∂chst), Synagogue Internet Archive Obermainanlage 8,Obermainanlage 8, Synagogue Internet Archive Ostendstra√üe 18,Ostendstra√üe 18, Synagogue Internet Archive Rechneigrabenstra√üe 5 (Niederhofheim'sche Synagoge),Rechneigrabenstra√üe 5 (Niederhofheim'sche Synagoge), Synagogue Internet Archive Schlo√üstra√üe 5,Schlo√üstra√üe 5, Synagogue Internet Archive and Unterlindau 21.Unterlindau 21, Synagogue Internet Archive The deportation of the Jewish residents to their deaths in the East quickened in pace after Kristallnacht. Their property and valuables were taken by the Gestapo before deportation, and they were subjected to extreme violence during transport to the stations for the cattle wagons which carried them east. Most ended up in new ghettoes established by the Nazis such as the Warsaw Ghetto before their murder in camps such as Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka. Jewish Cemetery on Battonnstra√üe A further witness to the Jewish ghetto is the large (11,850 m2 or 2.93 acres) Jewish Cemetery along the modern Battonnstra√üe. First mentioned in 1180, the cemetery had served the Jewish community until 1828. The oldest graves date from about 1270, which makes the Frankfurt Jewish Cemetery the second oldest in Germany (after Worms). The best known grave in the cemetery is Mayer Amschel Rothschild's tomb. From 1828 until 1929 Jews were buried in the Jewish Cemetery, next to the main cemetery on Rat-Beil Stra√üe. Starting in 1929 the new cemetery on Eckenheimer Landstra√üe was used for interments. Around this time, the old Jewish cemetery was closed and left undisturbed. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were approximately 7000 headstones in the cemetery. In November 1942, the Nazi mayor Friedrich Krebs ordered the destruction of the cemetery. By the end of the war, about two-thirds of the headstones were destroyed. Today only a small portion of the cemetery is still in the original condition. In 1996 11,134 small tablets were placed in the cemetery, each one engraved with the name of a Jewish citizen from Frankfurt who was murdered during the Holocaust.

Beachgrass thrives under conditions of shifting sand, sand burial, and high winds; it is a dune- building grass that builds the first line of sand dunes along the coast. Beachgrass is less vigorous in stabilized sand, and is only infrequently found further inland than the coastal foredunes. On the Atlantic coastline of North America, Ammophila breviligulata has been observed as far south as North Carolina, and is often planted in dune restoration projects. Ammophila breviligulata was introduced to the Pacific coast of North America in the 1930s. It is proving to be invasive, and is increasingly important to coastal ecology and development in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Description American beachgrass on Lake Michigan in Spring. The leaves of A. breviligulata have deeply furrowed upper surfaces and smooth undersides, and grow tall. The plant's inflorescence is a spike-like panicle that can reach long; the seed head appears in late July or August. The species name breviligulata derives from the Latin brevis (\\"short\\") and ligula (\\"tongue\\"), which refers to a feature of grass leaves called the ligule. Two varieties of American beachgrass growing on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario. The greener stand in the distance is Cape variety, and has been introduced to this area; it is native to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of North America. The browner stand in the foreground is the native \\"Champlain beachgrass\\" (sometimes considered a separate species A. champlain¬≠ensis). Ammophila breviligulata is quite similar in appearance and ecology to a second species of beachgrass, Ammophila arenaria (European beachgrass). As Nick Page has summarized, \\"Ammophila breviligulata is distinguished from A. arenaria by smaller ligules (1‚Äì3 mm versus 10‚Äì30 mm long in A. arenaria), wider and less inrolled leaves, longer flower spike (25‚Äì35 cm versus 15‚Äì25 cm long in A. arenaria), and scaly rather than puberulent leaf veins on the upper leaf surface.\\" Ecology Both species of beachgrass are noted for their association with stable sand dunes, and observations in regions where they were introduced to coasts indicate that they actually build the first line of dunes on coasts (the foredunes). The plants spread rapidly ‚Äì annually ‚Äì through the sand by subsurface runners (rhizomes), and can produce up to 100 stems per clump annually. They can tolerate burial in as much as of sand; sand burial stimulates the rhizomes to grow vertically, and is essential to plant vigor. The beachgrass species are also very good examples of xerophytes, being able to thrive on arid to semi- arid beach dunes. The plant has several mechanisms for adapting to heat stress or wind. The long narrow leaves can roll or fold, and the rough upper leaf surface, which contains the gas exchange openings (stomata), can orient itself away from wind. Beachgrass is a dominant species on foredunes, and indeed is sometimes the only plant found there. It is much less vigorous further in from the coastline, which is puzzling. Why should a species that competes so well on foredunes be fairly unsuccessful just a few meters further in from the coast, where other plants usually dominate? One mechanism for this effect that has been extensively studied by Wim van der Putten and his colleagues is based on the susceptibility of Ammophila species to soil pathogens such as nematodes. The density of these pathogens is low in freshly deposited sand, but builds up in the roots of beachgrass on stabilized sand. While the details are complex, the result is that beachgrass is largely limited to the foredunes that it builds, which are immediately adjacent to water's edge and where sand is removed and redeposited fairly frequently. Invasiveness Starting in the 19th century, A. arenaria was introduced to the Pacific coast of North America to help control beach sands; it serves this role so well that it is now considered invasive not only along this coast (from California north to British Columbia), but along nearly every coast worldwide where it has been introduced. Ammophila arenaria built foredunes (the dunes closest to the beach) that are typically about high, which is much higher than the dunes associated with the native dune grass species Leymus mollis. In the 1930s, A. breviligulata was introduced to about on the Clatsop Peninsula in Oregon.The town of Warrenton, Oregon and Fort Stevens State Park presently occupy the Clatsop Peninsula, which juts into the mouth of the Columbia River as it enters the Pacific Ocean. The introduction of A. breviligulata is believed to have been a part of the Warrenton Dunes stabilization project. Since then, A. breviligulata has gradually supplanted A. arenaria in Oregon and Washington; the precise reason for the relative success of A. breviligulata isn't known. The most recognizable aspect of the changeover between the beachgrass species is that the foredunes of A. breviligulata are shorter than the foredunes of A. arenaria; foredunes of A. breviligulata are about high in this region. The diversity of other species that co-exist with mature stands of A. arenaria is comparable to the species diversity with A. breviligulata. However, the lower foredune height for the latter means that coastal ecosystems that had adapted to the fairly tall foredunes of A. arenaria are again changing, especially in the regions just behind the foredune and sheltered by it. Similarly, buildings and roads that were constructed under the presumption of continuing protection by the tall A. arenaria foredunes may now be threatened by shifting sand and by increased exposure to wind and water in storms.

The eponymous Gibraltarian English accent is spoken in the territory. Many of Gibraltar's linguistic influences come from its neighbours, Spain and Morocco. Most locals are bilingual, also speaking Spanish, because of Gibraltar's proximity to Spain. Most Gibraltarians converse in Llanito, their vernacular which is mostly based on Andalusian Spanish but with numerous loanwords from English as well other Mediterranean languages. However, because of the varied mix of ethnic groups which reside there, other languages such as Moroccan Berber, Moroccan Arabic and Hindi are also spoken on The Rock. Llanito Llanito (pronounced ) is the main local vernacular, and is unique to Gibraltar. It consists of an eclectic mix of Andalusian Spanish and British English, as well as languages such as Maltese, Portuguese, Ligurian of the Genoese variety and Haketia. Andalusian Spanish is the main constituent of Llanito, but is also heavily influenced by British English. However, it borrows words and expressions of many other languages, with over 500 words of Genoese and Hebrew origin. It also typically involves code-switching to English. The term Llanito is also used as an alternative demonym to Gibraltarian. Spanish Over the course of its history, the Rock of Gibraltar has changed hands many times, among Spanish, Moorish, and British hands, although it has been consistently under British control since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Before the British takeover, Spanish was widely spoken, but afterwards as most residents left the Rock, the language had a much smaller population (in 1753 there were just 185 Spaniards, and only 134 in 1777Census of Gibraltar, 2001 ). However, the border with Spain has been opened since 1985, allowing easier travel in and out of Spain, one of the factors which has given Andalusian Spanish considerable presence in Gibraltar. In 2001, there were 326 people of Spanish nationality in Gibraltar, and a large number of \\"Frontier Workers\\" who commute there for work. Berber language and Maghrebi Arabic Owing to its close proximity to Morocco and Algeria, the Berber language and Maghrebi Arabic are spoken by the Moroccan and other North African minorities in the city. In 2001, there were 961 Moroccans in Gibraltar. Other languages Hindi and Sindhi is also spoken by the Indian community of Gibraltar. Maltese, a language which was widely used in Gibraltar up until the late 19th century, and is still spoken by some families of Maltese descent. Similarly, Genoese was spoken in Catalan Bay well into the 19th century, dying out in the early decades of the twentieth. Hebrew is also spoken by the Jewish community.

Captain Ilya Sergeev, bandmaster of the Military Band of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy. A bandmaster is the leader and conductor of a band, usually a concert band, military band, brass band or a marching band. British Armed Forces In the British Army, bandmasters of the Corps of Army Music now hold the rank of staff sergeant, warrant officer class 2 or warrant officer class 1. A commissioned officer who leads a band is known as the director of music. Directors of music are all former bandmasters who have been commissioned. All bandmasters initially joined the Army as musicians and were selected for bandmaster training from non-commissioned rank (usually having reached the rank of at least corporal). However, unlike most NCOs, bandmasters are promoted directly to staff sergeant on completion of their bandmaster training and have not necessarily worked their way through all the available ranks. British Army line infantry and cavalry regimental bands were led by bandmasters until the reorganisation of bands and the creation of the Corps of Army Music in 1994. The larger corps bands, as well as those of the Foot Guards and Household Cavalry, were known as staff bands, and were led by a commissioned director of music with a bandmaster as his deputy. In 1994, the number of bands was reduced and all bands became staff bands, effectively putting an end to the rank of 'bandsman' used in regimental line bands (the rank in staff bands being known as 'musician'). Bandmasters qualified before the reorganisation in 2014 were always immediately promoted to the rank of warrant officer class 1, with the designation of WO1(BM). They wear a unique appointment badge of a crowned lyre in a wreath underneath the WO1's badge (the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom). The senior playing musician of the band is normally the band sergeant major (or band corporal major in the Household Cavalry), a warrant officer class 2, although bandmasters (who are also appointed as training instructors) are expected to play within sections as and when required. Royal Marines Bands have been led by commissioned directors of music for many years. Bandmaster is an appointment which may be held by a warrant officer class 1 (WO1 BDMR), who is equivalent to an Army bandmaster, or a warrant officer class 2 (WO2 BDMR), who is equivalent to an Army band sergeant major. The Corps Bandmaster is the senior bandmaster of the Royal Marines and the chief non-commissioned adviser to the Principal Director of Music, Royal Marines. Until the introduction of warrant officers to the Royal Marines in 1973, the appointment of bandmaster was held by colour sergeants and that of staff bandmaster by quartermaster sergeants (equivalent to a warrant officer class 2), and there were no warrant officer class 1 equivalents in the Band Service. Royal Air Force bands have also traditionally been led by commissioned directors of music. The bandmaster is a warrant officer and fills the same position as the Army equivalent (RAF WOs do not hold appointments as do those in the other services and the RAF only has a single WO rank, equivalent to WO1 in the other services). The senior playing musician, the band sergeant, is a flight sergeant. United States Army A bandmaster of the United States Marine Band on Memorial Day. In the United States Army, a bandmaster of division and army garrison bands is typically a warrant officer or a chief warrant officer. A commissioned officer typically leads major command and/or special bands. The most recent manning documents have commissioned officers at 1st Armored Division, Ft. Bliss, TX and at 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, HI. A warrant officer is typically commander of the Old Guard Band. Warrant officer and chief warrant officer bandmasters are former enlisted musicians who have undergone rigorous in-service training in musical skills, conducting skills and military leadership. They are seconded in their individual bands by the senior enlisted bandmember, usually a first sergeant or sergeant major, who is designated enlisted bandleader. The Salvation Army Bandmaster is a non-commissioned (or local) officer rank in The Salvation Army. A Salvation Army bandmaster is responsible for the ministry of a Salvation Army band and tends to the musical and spiritual development of the bandsmen and women. The bandmaster is assisted by a deputy bandmaster, band sergeant, and band secretary. These roles are also non-commissioned officer ranks. The band may also have a band colour sergeant and a band librarian. All of these roles will normally be undertaken by volunteer Salvationists who give their time and services free of charge.Orders and Regulations for Bands and Songster Bridgades; Orders and Regulations for Local Officers; Orders and Regulations for Corps Secretaries and Corps Treasurers Charles Fry was the very first Salvation Army bandmaster.

He also served as United States Deputy Secretary of State. He was president of CBTF Co. and M Ship Co., a board member of Nike and Chairman of Nike‚Äôs Finance Committee. Biography Robinson was born in Long Beach, California and spent his early years on a ranch overlooking the Antelope Valley in the Western Mojave Desert. He received his bachelor's degree cum laude in international economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1941. After graduating from a 90-day engineering program at the United States Naval Academy in May 1942, he stayed on as an instructor for another year. He then received an assignment to the heavy cruiser USS Tuscaloosa and spent nearly two years on the treacherous Murmansk run. The young lieutenant found himself in charge of the main engine division on the ship during the D-Day landing of Normandy, during which the Tuscaloosa engaged in a long battle with a German battery (reported by the Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent Ira Wolfert in the August 1944 issue of Reader's Digest). After further duty in the Pacific at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, in February 1946, Robinson had earned enough points to be discharged from the Navy and left for Palo Alto, California to enter the Stanford University Business School. He graduated with a business degree through an accelerated program in May 1947. He died on May 20, 2014, aged 94, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

(This region was named the District of Marcona by the Peruvian government in 1955.) The Marcona board members from Utah Construction consisted of Mariner Eccles, Ed Littlefield and Alan Christensen see photo. Through Robinson‚Äôs innovative vision, the Marcona company expanded into the shipping industry. In an effort to support the transport of iron ore to Japan, Robinson continued to push for larger ships eventually designing and in 1961 constructing the first Panamax, the largest vessel to navigate the Panama Canal. This 105,000 ton ship received much press coverage at the time. Other innovations included the development of a slurry system (Marconaflo) to transport iron ore from mine into and out of ships in a fluid state and development of the first joint oil/ore carriers. *1950-74 Mining/steel operations and port development in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Australia, India and Chile. This includes establishment of Samarco (joint venture between Marcona and Samitri, a Brazilian company) through which iron ore mined at Minas Gerais (Brazil) was transported via slurry pipeline to a port they developed at Ponta Ubu. Robinson selected Al-Jubail (Saudi Arabia) as the location to develop a port to deliver the iron ore and develop Saudi Arabia's first steel mill. Oil was then transported back to Brazil from Saudi Arabia in the same ships. *1974 Appointed as Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs during the Gerald Ford administration.

Hare Krishna community now has only two of their 10 currently registered communities ‚Äì in Astana and in the commercial capital Almaty - more than 50 members.World wide Religious News Thirty Hare Krishna families, most of them Kazakh citizens, lived in about 60 summer huts in Almaty. Although the Hare Krishna movement was registered at the national and local levels, leaders reported continuing harassment by the local government in the form of repeated lawsuits seeking confiscation of land in Almaty Oblast used as a communal farm. In April 2006 an appeals court upheld a lower court decision that the land should revert to the Karasai regional akimat (equivalent to a county government), because the farmer from whom Hare Krishna followers had purchased the land in 1999 did not hold title, and thus the land had not been properly privatized. On April 25, 2006, local officials went to the commune to evict the followers. Hare Krishna followers peacefully resisted and local authorities did not escalate the situation through force. The Hare Krishnas claimed that the local government targeted the commune because they were a nontraditional religious community. They cited statements by local officials, such as an April 25, 2006, interview with Channel 31 in which a Karasai akimat official stated that the Hare Krishnas were \\"not accepted as a religion,\\" and that they were dangerous for the country. Independent religious observers, however, believed that the cases are motivated primarily by a financial interest in the land, the value of which has appreciated significantly since 1999. Human rights advocates and international observers brought the issue to the attention of national officials. At the end of the reporting period, the Government had not evicted the residents from the commune and the Hare Krishnas' appeal was pending before the Supreme Court. Prior to the land confiscation lawsuits, the Hare Krishnas reported tense relations with Karasai akimat authorities, which they believe resulted in the community being subject to frequent inspections. In 2004 the Hare Krishna commune was the subject of eleven inspections by different government agencies including the police, fire protection service, sanitary agency, environment protection agency, and land committee, and subsequently fined for various violations. According to the US State Department, the Hare Krishnas admitted several violations, which they attempted to rectify, but maintained that they had been subjected to closer scrutiny than their neighbors.United States Department of State See also *Persecution of Hindus  References  External links *Hindu‚Äôs Problem in Kazakhstan *Video of demolition * International Religious Freedom Report 2006 Kazakhstan Kazakhstan Kazakhstan Category:Religion in Kazakhstan ","title":"Hinduism in Kazakhstan"},{"id":"8134117","text":"Awarded Speaker and Multi-Record Adventurer Richard Bowles Richard Bowles (born 19 September 1978, in Leicester, England) Director of Adventure Alchemy a learning and development consultancy is an Awarded speaker, International Educator and Multi-Record Adventurer.

In 2012, Bowles became the first person to run Australia‚Äôs Bicentennial National Trail (BNT). Running from Healesville, Victoria to Cooktown, Queensland, he covered 5,330 km in five months. Only two weeks after completing the BNT, Bowles ran New Zealand's Te Araroa Trail, at 3,054km becoming the first person to complete it. In 2013 Bowles ran the Israel National Trail, covering its 1,009 km length in 13 days after a life-threatening foot infection delayed his original plan of 12 days. Later that year, he became the first person to run an exploding volcano, Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra, after covering 800km from the east of the island to its west. In 2014 Bowles completed South Australia's 1,200 km Heysen Trail, averaging 85 ;km a day in 14 days, smashing the previous 25-day record. In 2017 Dr Ricardo Costa of Monash University approached Bowles about testing his endurance fitness. Bowles ran 50 km a day for a week on a treadmill in a 32 ¬∞C climate-controlled tent, while carrying 12 kg. This was to replicate multi- stage races and the nutrition requirements needed in desert environments.
