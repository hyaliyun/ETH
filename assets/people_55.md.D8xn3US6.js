Having lost her legs as a child, and possibly her parents, she was raised in a series of mission homes, hospitals and boarding schools. Returning to Canada around 1908, she worked at the Grenfell Mission in Labrador. After losing family members in the 1918 flu pandemic, Mucko trained as a nurse and midwife, providing services for her community until her later years. A woman's shelter in Rigolet has been named in her honor. Early life Kirkina, (Elizabeth Jeffries), circa 1903 Elizabeth Jeffries was born in 1890 on the shores of Hamilton Inlet, near Rigolet, Labrador to Adam Jeffries (another source calls the father Emo Jeffery), an Inuit-Scots trapper and his wife. As a toddler, her legs were frozen and amputated below the knee by her father with an axe. Later, she was taken to the Indian Harbour Hospital for a surgery to create proper stumps, where Wilfred Grenfell met her when she was around four years old. A nurse, took Elizabeth to a temporary school at Halifax, Nova Scotia and by 1902, she was writing letters in English. By age ten, Elizabeth was able to agilely move about on the leather pads which her father had fashioned for her. In 1900, Grenfell, who renamed her Kirkina, took her to Battle Harbour Hospital, where she remained for two years. A letter dated 9 November 1902 from Kirkina to a Massachusetts family who had sent Jeffries a doll, said her legs would be completed within a week by Dr. John McPherson, who was part of the mission staff. He fashioned temporary wooden artificial legs, which she quickly learned to use. Around 1903, Kirkina received her first pair of cork limbs from donors in Boston, Massachusetts and when Dr. McPherson and his wife left Labrador later that year, they took her with them first to Boston and then to Mexico. Kirkina returned to New York for schooling for two years and then returned to the McPhersons in Mexico. After four years in Mexico, Jeffries returned to Canada, in 1908 and initially lived with a nurse in Forteau. In 1912, Gaffney secured a new set of legs for Kirkina through donors in the U.S. Gaffney continued to use the story of Kirkina and other indigenous orphans to garner donations for his charitable works. Career Jeffries began working at the Grenfell Mission at St. Anthony. On 20 March 1916, she married a trapper who was thirty years her senior, Adam Mucko. In the 1918 flu pandemic, she lost her husband and some of her children, deciding in the aftermath to study nursing and midwifery at the mission. Mucko lived in Rigolet and offered nursing services to anyone within a 35-mile radius of her property. In 1950, having worn out her previous artificial legs, airmen from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air Force stationed at Goose Bay Canadian Forces Base donated a pair of legs and sent her to St. John's, Newfoundland for the fitting. By 1961, those legs had worn out and airmen on the base again collected money to replace her limbs. She continued nursing until the end of her life, though in her later years, lived with her daughter in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Mucko died in 1970 and posthumously, a women's shelter in Rigolet was named in her honor.

The surveys were the first attempt to assess the economic impact of September 11 on artists.Jeffri, Joan with Greenblat, Robert. \\"Information on Artists 2: A Study of Artists' Work-Related Human and Social Service Needs in Four U.S. Locations.\\" This impact had been masked by other events until the survey results were released.

Nevertheless, governmental and institutional recovery efforts had not contributed to the arts sector, and weaknesses in the cultural economy had caused some artists to start doing other work, and caused others to move elsewhere. The surveys inspired a series of later investigations into weaknesses in the arts and cultural economy in New York City. Personal life Slaff lives in Greenwich Village with his family.

Early and personal life Prabir was born in Kolkatta, India on 18 February 1934 in the Sandell family. He had his earlier education in Rabindranath Tagore institution, Viswabharati, and St. Xavier's school and college in Kolkatta, West Bengal. After graduating with physics honors, he completed his M.Sc.(tech) degree and published 3 research notes in nuclear physics in Indian Journal of Physics. Subsequently, he obtained his Ph.D. degree in International Management and also was awarded a diploma in marketing from Bombay University. Career Dr. Sandell was in Philips India Lt. a subsidiary of the international Philips group from 1956 to 1972 as a manager of the scientific and professional electronic division, and in this role, he drove the first ever manufacturing in India of electronic instruments and professional electronic equipment in Bombay, Pune, and Kolkatta. Subsequently, from 1972 to 1982, as general manager of communication division of Tata group's Forbes company and as managing director of Uptron Electronics, a UP state government company, he led the manufacturing of power electronics equipment in India. Subsequently, at the invitation of the government of India, he joined E.T.&T; as managing director of electronics trade and technology development company of the government of India. As Chairman of ET&T;, Sandell developed the concept of using low power terrestrial transmission technology by using S-Band transmission satellite transducers and large parabolic dishes at reception centers in cities spread throughout India. This proposal resulted in lower cost (about Rupees 25 lacs per system) compared to the alternative solution of using high power systems proposed by Doordarshan, the government’s official TV authority. This was operational across 20 cities within 9 months as against 2 years required by Doordarshan engineers. Sandell was also the first to drive the indigenous manufacturing of O.B. color TV vans for outdoor coverage of TV events. He also facilitated the training of local manufacturers of color TV sets and other peripherals such as antennae. As a result of these efforts, all these methods and designs for color TV manufacturing and transmission were standardized by the government of India. Subsequently, as a member of UNIDO, Sandell created the Institute of Small Scale Electronics Production in Bandung, Indonesia in collaboration with National Electronics Laboratory of the Government of Indonesia.

The Mundt–Nixon Bill, named after Karl E. Mundt and Richard Nixon, formally the Subversive Activities Control Act, was a proposed law in 1948 that would have required all members of the Communist Party of the United States register with the Attorney General. History U.S. Representative Karl E. Mundt. Hearings for this bill (as well as a tougher bill that would have outlawed the Communist Party) started in February 1948. =House bill passes= U.S. Representative Richard M. Nixon campaigns for Senate (1950) The bill, also known as the \\"Subversive Activities Control Act [of] 1948,\\" was first introduced in 1948 as H.R. (House Resolution) 5852, at which time it was known as the Mundt–Nixon Bill. In his memoirs, Nixon described it as a bill to implement \\"a new approach to the complicated problem of internal communist subversion... It provided for registration of all Communist Party members and required a statement of the source of all printed and broadcast material issued by organizations that were found to be Communist fronts.\\" Nixon served as floor manager for the Republican Party; Vito Marcantonio served as floor manager for the Democratic Party. On May 19, 1948, the bill passed the House by 319 to 58. Forty-six Harvard University professors publicly opposed its passage. (The Nixon Library cites this bill's passage as Nixon's first significant victory in Congress. ) On May 23, 1948, the New York Times summed up the Mundt–Nixon Bill's future as follows. Supporters argued it would allow the Government to \\"control the communists\\" via registration and other methods to \\"drive the communists and their allies into the open.\\" Opponents argued the unconstitutionality of many provisions against freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as well as a means to \\"crack down\\" on labor and progressive political groups. =Senate investigation= U.S. Representative Leo Isacson. The Senate Judicial Committee held hearings May 27–30, 1948, for \\"the purpose of receiving testimony and opinions in relation to the constitutionality and practicality of H. R. 5852.\\" The committee heard testimony from leftwing and rightwing political and union leaders, attorneys, who included: Father John Francis Cronin, William Z. Foster, John Gates, Rep. Leo Isacson, Kenneth Parkinson, Rep. J. Hardin Peterson, Donald Richberg, Paul Robeson, O. John Rogge, Norman Thomas, and former vice president Henry A. Wallace. The resulting report also included briefs, memoranda, letters, resolutions, and editorials from former US Solicitor General Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., John W. Davis, then-current US Attorney General Tom Clark, the ACLU, Louis Waldman, Morris Ernst, Lee Pressman, future Subversive Activities Control Board chairman Seth W. Richardson, Merwin K. Hart, the CPUSA, U.S. Senator Alexander Wiley, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, John Thomas Taylor, the Milwaukee Journal, the Milwaukee Sentinel, the Atlanta Journal, the New York Herald Tribune, the New York Times, the Brooklyn Eagle, and U.S. Rep. Samuel Pettengill. On May 27, 1948, Rep. Leo Isacson of the American Labor Party of New York (which was representing the Progressive Party in the state), told the committee that the bill would bring \\"disaster to the American people.\\" He noted that Congress was rushing through the Mundt–Nixon Bill, yet holding up an anti-lynching bill. He declared his love of the \\"American form of government,\\" which was the reason for his testimony. On May 28, 1948, CPUSA national chairman William Z. Foster told the committee (\\"testified under oath\\") that American Communists would not support a war against the Soviet Union, because \\"Soviets don't make wars.\\" He also said that they would not obey the Mundt–Nixon Bill, should it pass the Senate into law. Daily Worker editor John Gates concurred. Foster called the bill \\"a Fascist act of war preparation, just as Hitler's Nuremberg decrees and the Japanese ban on 'dangerous thoughts' were acts of preparation for World War II.\\" The New York Times reprinted Foster's full testimony the following day. On May 30, 1948, Henry A. Wallace, U.S. presidential candidate for the Progressive Party, told the committee he considered the Mundt–Nixon Bill an offensive act in the \\"cold war against Russia.\\" On May 30, 1948, Paul Robeson asked Congress not to pass this bill but rather to seek peace, while committee members pressed him to state whether he was a member of the Communist Party. The Senate recessed the hearings on May 30, 1948. =Public debate= William Z. Foster, CPUSA head On May 31, 1948, at 10:00 PM, Representative Mundt and Communist Party chairman Foster debated for an hour live on WJZ-ABC radio (now WABC (AM)). Foster was speaking from New York City; Mundt was speaking from Yankton, South Dakota (his home state). Foster stated that not only would the Mundt–Nixon Bill outlaw the Communist Party but also \\"knife organized labor, undermine American democracy, clear the way for a police state, and speed us into war.\\" Mundt stated first that Communism was labor's \\"worst enemy\\" and that, rather than drive the Party underground, the bill would expose it so it could not \\"undermine the country by conspiracy.\\" On June 4, 1948, attorney Dana Converse Backus wrote to the New York Times a strongly worded letter \\"The Mundt-Nixon Bill: Suggestions Given for Revision of Proposed Legislation.\\" With regard to American Communists, he stated, \\"a sense of proportion\\" is necessary so Americans might \\"realize that we are dealing more with a microbe than a menace.\\" In his opinion, \\"the best weapon against a Communist is to know that he is one,\\" while preserving civil liberties. The Mundt–Nixon Bill would outlaw communist parties in the U.S. and thus \\"encourage a multiplicity of Communist front organizations.\\" \\"I suggest scrapping this whole attempt to register Communist front organization.\\" Instead, he recommended that any organization which solicits funds should have to declare any officer or director or equivalent is a communist; if the organization has communists, then it should then have to declare so when soliciting funds, while it should also lose its tax exemption. Backus considered this proposal a temporary, \\"cautious experiment\\" for extraordinary times. By June 5, 1948, the New York Times noted, the Mundt Bill's future was \\"clouded.\\" On June 6, 1948, ACLU lawyer Raymond L. Wise's letter to the New York Times appeared, asking for \\"careful study\\" of the provisions of the Mundt–Nixon Bill. Summarizing the bill's spirit and intent, he wrote: > It is contrary to our fundamental theories of government to penalize or put > pressure on expression of opinion or on free association in advance of > personal criminal guilt, established after arial by due process of law. No > political groups are singled out for special criminal laws. We do not > recognize 'guilt by association.' As late as June 20, 1948, letters continued in the New York Times as the public debated the bill. =March on Washington= U.S. Representative Jerry O'Connell. On May 31, protesters announced their plan to come by the \\"thousands\\" to Washington, DC, to demonstrate against the Mundt–Nixon Bill. First in the hearing room and then in front of the U.S. Senate Office Building, lead organizer Len Goldsmith stated, \\"By God, we are coming down by the thousands on Wednesday, and if they won't listen we will find other means.\\" Goldman promised an \\"orderly\\" march of people, brought in by \\"trainloads and planeloads.\\" Godman asked for the right of the public to be heard and insisted on \\"assurances\\" for open hearings. The New York Times noted that Goldman led the \\"Committee for Democratic Rights\\" and that he wore a blue campaign button for candidate Wallace. By June 1, 1948, Wallace supporters visibly \\"took command\\" of the march on Washington. Former congressional representative Jerry J. O'Connell became chairman of a \\"National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill.\\" The committee claimed that more than 5,000 would march on Washington on June 2. On June 2, 1948, a \\"delegation of 200 New Yorkers\\" exploded into more than 3,000 people bound by train for Washington, DC, to protest the Mundt–Nixon Bill. Goldsmith led the effort to make train reservations, scheduled to leave New York's Penn Station as of 6:45 AM. He said his committee had also chartered for DC-4 planes from California, Washington, Oregon, as well as trains from Chicago, Boston, and other cities. Goldman stated, \\"This is a protest by Americans of all political parties against denial of their right to be heard on proposed legislation of vital importance.\\" Marchers were to converge on Turner's Arena in Washington, DC, and after lunch march on Capitol Hill to meet with politicians. They also planned to hold an open-air gathering, whose speakers would include: Representative Vito Marcantonio, Senator William Langer, Senator Glen Taylor (Wallace's vice presidential running mate), and Paul Robeson. Supporters included: O'Connell as chairmail, the announcement werit on, included: the \\"National Wallace Organization,\\" the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers, the International Longshoremen's and Warelhousemen'sUnion, the Civil Rights Congress, and the New York Committee for Democratic Rights. (Also on June 2, 1948, U.S. Immigration and FBI officials arrested a top Communist Party leader, Jack Stachel, in New York City on a warrant for deportation proceedings. On June 28, 1948, the Government would indict Stachel and ten other top Party leaders for violating the Smith Act and try them in 1949 in the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.) (Also on June 2, 1948, Mundt and Nixon won their respective primaries. ) On June 3, 1948, \\"thousand marched on Washington\\" to defeat the Mundt-Nixon Communist Control Bill. The New York Times described: > For an hour they threw a line of mass pickets, five and six abreast, across > the entrance to the White House, although President Truman himself has long > demanded passage of the civil rights measures. Other pickets took up > stations briefly outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic > National Committees. > The demonstrators moved upon Congress in many groups numbering hundreds > each, seeking directly to influence the Senators from their states. > Finally, at a rally tonight on the green slopes below the Washington > Monument, their speakers urged them to continue the \\"fire\\" of telegrams, > delegations and protests toward Congress. Former Representative O'Connell estimated that more than 5,000 people had protested. The Times reported \\"police were everywhere, although unobtrusively so.\\" Meanwhile, \\"the Senate, the point to which the marchers were attempting to apply their maximum pressure, went through a typical, unhurried legislative day.\\" Later that night, John Howard Lawson and Howard Fast joined Paul Robeson spoke against the bill to crowd of 1,000 people in New York City gathered by Masses and Mainstream, a communist publication. (Also on June 3, 1948, a House committee passed legislation to deport six alleged Communists. ) =Senate bill fizzles= U.S. Senator Homer S. Ferguson. As early as May 23, 1948, the New York Times was anticipating that \\"the Senate will duck the issue, at least for the remainder of this session.\\" By June 2, 1948, the New York Times reported that \\"the immediate effect of this [looming march on Washington] was a stiffening of attitude among some influential Senators, who previously had been prepared to concede that the measure, or any like it was as good as dead for this session of Congress.\\" Further, it noted, \\"Some Republicans asserted that the supporters of Mr. Wallace, the Third party Presidential candidate, were seeking to present him before the country as having defeated a measure which already had had only the dimmest outlook for passage. On June 3, 1948, Republicans senators Robert A. Taft and Homer S. Ferguson proposed a \\"Ferguson Amendment\\" to the Mundt-Nixon Communist Control Bill, which would \\"deny to the Attorney General any power even provisionally to label an organization as subversive and would require him to go to court directly to start any such proceeding.\\" (In the House bill, the Attorney General could find a group subversive, subject to court appeal.) In effect, the amendment would make a court \\"sole and original judge of evidence.\\" On June 4, 1948, the Senate Judiciary Committee decided not to resume its hearings on the Mundt-Nixon Communist Control Bill. By June 5, 1948, the Senate had locked into a \\"debate of surpassing bitterness and vehemence.\\" On June 6, 1948, Senator Alexander Wiley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that his committee continued to weigh the Mundt–Nixon Bill with \\"a fair and open mind.\\" Ultimately, the Senate did not act on the Mundt–Nixon Bill, and the bill fizzled. Opening text of HR 5828 HR 5852 opens as follows, with the aim of combatting \\"a world communist movement\\" (with the words \\"communism\\" or \\"communist\\" bolded to facilitate eyescan): > [H. R. 5852, 80th Cong., 2d sess.] AN ACT To protect the United States > against un-American and subversive activities.

The building is on a ledge about below street level, overlooking Fall Creek and Ithaca Falls. One of just two Egyptian Revival buildings in Tompkins County, along with the Masonic Temple in downtown Ithaca, it is part of the Cornell Heights Historic District. History 900 Stewart Avenue from the road, August 2016 900 Stewart Avenue from across the gorge, August 2016 The building was built as the meeting place of the Sphinx Head Society, a Cornell University secret society formed in 1890. The society had discussed building a meeting place since the early 1900s, and bought the site in 1908. At the time, the site was far away from campus, secluded by trees, and lacking neighbors across the gorge. After raising $25,000 they hired local architect J. Lakin Bainbridge, who also designed the Tompkins County Courthouse. Ground was broken in 1925, and the building was finished in 1926. The design was intended to resemble an Egyptian tomb, perhaps partly as a delayed expression of the popularity of Egyptian Revival architecture in the late 1800s, perhaps partly as a resurgence in popular interest in Classical Egypt after the opening of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, and perhaps partly because of similar structures at Yale and Dartmouth (the Skull and Bones tomb and the Sphinx, respectively). The building only had a single door, and no windows. A journalist described the eeriness of being inside it: Eventually, the tomb became less useful to the society, due to its remote location, the lack of nearby parking, and the increased property taxes and maintenance costs. In 1969, the society sold the property to the next-door neighbor, physicist Robert Wilson. He used it as a sculpture studio before selling it to architect and design professor Steve Mensch in 1979. \\"I'd been trying to buy it for the last eight years,\\" Mensch told the Cornell Daily Sun: Mensch undertook a substantial renovation. He cut a huge, floor-to-ceiling window in the gorge-facing side of the formerly windowless tomb. He built a one-story addition with three bedrooms just below the tomb, a glass pavilion on the same level as the tomb, and a new parking spot and building for the entry staircase. He did large parts of the construction work himself, and held his office hours on the site. \\"One no longer has the sense of entering an ancient, shadowy, secret chamber in a remote location,\\" a journalist wrote. \\"It's a good deal more like finding an unsuspected open-air museum set in the midst of a small but lovely park overlooking the city.\\" Astronomer Carl Sagan bought it in 1981, on returning to Cornell from several years in Los Angeles making the documentary Cosmos. He used the complex as a residence for many years, and looked for an architect to help him renovate it. Eventually, he hired Atelier Jullian and Pendleton, whose principal, Guillermo Jullian de la Fuente, had been a student of Le Corbusier. The architects designed a new, separate residence for Sagan in Cayuga Heights, and prepared an extensive, two-stage redesign plan for the tomb to turn it into a study for him and his wife, Ann Druyan. Mensch's additions were demolished, with the exception of the new entry staircase. New windows and skylights were added. On top of the tomb, a small teak penthouse was built, inspired by \\"images of canal barges and of boats on the lake.\\" The renovation, which took place from 1990 to 1992, was featured in a photo spread in Architectural Digest. The second phase of the renovation, which was to include a series of additional buildings terraced above and below the tomb, was never built. Sagan's biographer William Poundstone writes: At one point, the fraternity across the gorge invited Sagan to dinner; when he declined, suspecting them of having repeatedly vandalized a visibility mirror on the house's driveway, they arranged strings of Christmas lights to project the words, \\"Carl Sagan Sucks!\\" across the gorge at him. A popular (and inaccurate) local rumor was that there was a secret tunnel between the house and Cornell, so that Sagan could drive his Porsche to campus unmolested. After Sagan's death, his papers remained in the building until being transferred to the Library of Congress in 2012. Writing for New York magazine in 2014, Sagan's daughter described the house as \\"like something straight out of ancient Sumeria, or Indiana Jones—but it was not, in either case, something you'd expect to find in upstate New York.\\" As of 2016, the building is still owned by his widow, Ann Druyan, and is assessed at $475,000.

They often serve to excuse sexual aggression, create hostility toward victims, and bias criminal prosecution. Extensive research has been conducted about types, acceptance, and impact of rape myths. Rape myths significantly influence the perspectives of jurors, investigative agencies, judges, perpetrators, and victims. False views about rape lead to victim blaming, shaming, questioning of the victim's honesty, and other problems. Determination of the guilt of the accused, and sentencing for sexual crimes, are also influenced by these beliefs. Development of the concept Rape myths originate from various cultural stereotypes, such as traditional gender roles, acceptance of interpersonal violence, and misunderstanding the nature of sexual assault. Matthew Hale, a British jurist in the 17th century, suggests that rape is “an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved and harder to be defended against by the party accused, tho [sic] never so innocent”. His historical thoughts invisibly support many rape myths we see today, and continue to be reproduced in rape trials. Rape myths first became a topic of research during the 1970s, when a number of studies and books explored the concept. In 1974, for example, feminist writer Susan Brownmiller decried \\"male myths of rape\\" which \\"deliberately obscure the true nature of rape\\" in her book Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape. The same year, criminologists Julia and Herman Schwendinger studied common misconceptions about rape, including the notion that rape was impossible - i.e., that any woman who really wanted to could prevent a rape - the idea victims of rape were \\"asking for it,\\" and the idea that men rape because of \\"uncontrollable passions.\\" They termed these misconceptions \\"sexist myths\\" which \\"influence the treatment of women victims.\\" Both Brownmiller's work and the Schwendingers' study suggested that rape myths perpetuated male violence against women by placing blame on the victim, excusing the rapist, and minimizing or justifying the act of rape. In 1980, Martha Burt published the first major study of rape myth acceptance. Burt defined rape myths as \\"prejudicial, stereotyped and false beliefs about rape, rape victims and rapists\\" which create \\"a climate hostile to rape victims.\\" Burt's definition has been widely used. In 1994, Kimberly A. Lonsway and Louise F. Fitzgerald defined rape myths as \\"attitudes and beliefs that are generally false but are widely and persistently held, and that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression against women.\\"Kimberly A. Lonsway, Louise F. Fitzgerald, \\"Rape Myths: In Review\\" Psychology of Women Quarterly 18 (2), June 1994: 133-164. Some scholars, such as Gerd Bohner and Heike Gerger, have argued that descriptors such as \\"false\\" and \\"widely held\\" should not be included in a formal definition of what rape myths are since myths are often constructed in a way that are impossible to falsify, (as in the example, \\"many women secretly desire to be raped,\\" where \\"secret\\" desire cannot be disproven) and the degree to which rape myths are \\"widely held\\" or accepted may vary over time. Bohner has offered an alternative definition of rape myths as \\"descriptive or prescriptive beliefs about rape (ie, about its causes, context, consequences, perpetrators, victims and their interaction) that serve to deny, downplay or justify sexual violence against women.\\"Gerd Bohner, Vergewaltigungsmythen (Rape Myths) Verlag Empirische Pädagogik, 1998. While scholars disagree somewhat on how to precisely define the concept of rape myths, and rape myths can vary across different cultures and societies, there is a general consensus that there are four basic types of rape myths: those that blame the victim for their rape, those that express doubt or disbelief about victim's reports of a rape, those that exonerate the rapist, and those that suggest that only a certain type of woman gets raped.Grubb, Amy & Turner, Emily. (2012). \\"Attribution of blame in rape cases: A review of the impact of rape myth acceptance, gender role conformity and substance use on victim blaming\\" Aggression and Violent Behavior 17 (5) 443-452. *\\"Rape myths vary among societies and cultures. However, they consistently follow a pattern whereby, they blame the victim for their rape, express a disbelief in claims of rape, exonerate the perpetrator and allude that only certain types of women are raped.\\" Lonsway, Fitzgerald and Diana L. Payne wrote in 1999 that the term \\"rape myth\\" does not imply that a given scenario never occurs, and \\"it is clear that any individual instance might conform to the characteristics described in cultural male mythology,\\" since there is \\"undeniably some percentage of women\\" who have made false reports of rape, and there are \\"certain situational or personal characteristics that differentiate women who have been raped from those who have not.\\" They argue, however, that rape myths are \\"generally false\\" in nature, and function to deny and justify the victimization of women. = Heteronormative discourses = Heteronormativity and associated discourses undergird and perpetuate many rape myths. The construction of the male sexual subject and female passive object serves to de-legitimatize allegations of sexual assault that are contrary to heterosexual norms, such as where women are perpetrators and men are victims. Through the “male sexual drive discourse”, it is thought that men are always ready and desiring sex, and women “activate their interest”, which can invalidate experiences that do not confirm to this discourse. Similarly, the “have/hold discourse” produces women as asexual, and heterosexual pleasure comes secondary to the ultimate goal of having a relationship and family. Common rape myths Common rape myths may include: *That women commonly or routinely lie about rape. *\\"Common rape myths may include: women often lie about rape, a victim's clothing can precipitate a sexual assault, rape is the fault of the victim if she was intoxicated, and when a male pays for a date, the woman is expected to reciprocate with sexual intercourse.\\" *\\"Some rape myths include: that women fantasize about being raped; that women routinely lie about rape; that men cannot rape their intimate partners; that rape is simply unwanted sex and not a violent crime; and that victims are usually attacked by strangers.\\"Rebecca M. Hayes1, Katherine Lorenz2, Kristin A.

Sex Roles (2005) 53: 385. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-005-6761-4 (In reality, most rapes are committed by friends, family, or other individuals known to the victim.) *That when a male pays for a dinner or date, a woman is expected to reciprocate with intercourse. *That women who are raped often deserve it - particularly if they entered a man's home or got in his car, or that such actions indicate consent to sex. *That it is not rape unless the victim fights/physically resists, or that it is not rape unless the victim is physically coerced or injured. (In reality, many rapes do not involve physical coercion, as in cases where the victim is impaired/unconscious, or where an unequal power relationship forces the victim to submit.) *That a woman should be able to avoid rape by \\"fighting off\\" the rapist, and that she has the responsibility to do so. *That some women secretly want to be raped. *That it is impossible to rape one's wife or intimate partner. *That rape is simply unwanted sex, not a violent crime. *That women \\"ask for\\" rape - for example, by flirting, dressing provocatively, consuming alcohol or behaving promiscuously \\\\- or that only certain \\"kinds of\\" women (i.e., \\"bad girls\\") are raped. *That men are unable to control themselves once they become sexually excited, that women are responsible for rape if they allow things to go too far, or that consent to kissing, petting, etc. constitutes consent to intercourse. *That women commonly falsely allege rape out of spite, to overcome guilt after a sexual encounter they regret, to cover up an unwanted pregnancy, or for attention. *That rape must be sexually motivated. Many researchers have concluded that power and/or anger, not sex, are often the dominant motivator of rapes. *That most rapists are psychotic or mentally ill. *That consent to one sexual encounter constitutes consent to another (i.e., that it cannot be rape if the victim and rapist have previously had consensual sex). *That \\"real\\" victims report rape immediately. (In reality, victims often don't report rapes immediately due to societal pressure, possible backlash, and trauma such as rape related post traumatic stress disorder, also known as rape trauma syndrome. Victims of rape may also feel feelings of guilt and shame which deter them from reporting the crime, or doing so promptly.) =Rape myths involving male victims= Most of the rape myths listed above deal with the rape of women by men. There has been less research on perceptions of rapes of male victims, whether by women or by other men. The following have been identified: Rape myths can stem from the media and are largely held by the general population. Research suggests that a common myth is that men experience little trauma when perpetrated by a woman. *That being raped by a male attacker is synonymous with the loss of masculinity. *That men who are sexually assaulted by men must be gay. *That men are incapable of functioning sexually unless they are sexually aroused. *That men cannot be forced to have sex against their will. *That men are less affected by sexual assault than women. *That men are in a constant state of readiness to accept any sexual opportunity. *That a man is expected to be able to defend himself against sexual assault. They may also include the following beliefs: *\\"Denial\\": That male rape does not exist. *\\"Blame\\": That male rape is victim's fault. *\\"Trauma\\": That men are less traumatized by the rape. The latter two categories show higher myth acceptance in the case when the perpetrator is a female. Male victims are also placed with the blame of their rape more often than female victims. = Racial rape myths = Scholars have argued that racism remains a critical component of sexual violence discourse within the United States. Alcoff and Gray state that white victims who report they were raped by non-white perpetrators are more likely to be believed than non-white victims who report white perpetrators. Not only are non-white bodies seen as not rapable, but non-white men are seen as sexually deviant, violent, and dangerous. In the context of African American men, Dawn Rae Flood argues that the history of race relations within America constructs accused African American men as guilty of any accusations against a white woman, because of their “inherently criminal sexual nature”. Flood argues that under white supremacy, black sexuality was constructed as “foreign”, “savage”, immoral, and predatory towards white women. Rooted in slavery and the white slave owners’ access to Black women, the “Jezebel” rape myth portrays Black women as “unrapable”, due to a belief that they are “sexually promiscuous” and would not refuse to consent. Black women are also portrayed as asexual, due to the “mammy” stereotype, which depicts them as motherly and lacking sexual characteristics. Sherene Razack argues that indigenous people are seen as hypersexual, and she argues that “bodies in degenerate spaces” lose their personhood due to the naturalization of violence, and in the context of indigenous sex workers, these women through being marked “as a body to be violated\\", become “unrapable”. = Marital rape myths = Jennifer Koshan states that many marital rape myths were born from British attitudes and laws during colonial times and were rationales that granted criminal immunity to husbands accused of marital rape. Such myths include: * Women in intimate relationships are in a state of perpetual consent, or the “implied consent theory”. * Wives could not be raped, because they joined “the person of her husband”, or the “theory of coverture”. * Wives became the property of their husband, and could be raped without regard for punishment. * Women that consent to sex with their partner after being raped cannot claim to being raped. * Being raped by one’s husband is “less severe than being raped by a stranger. * Marital rape allegations are “vengeful women crying rape”, and women are “prone to fabrication”. Problems arising out of rape myths The prevalence of rape myths is a major reason for rape victim blaming and stigmatization. Rape myths can cause victims of rape to blame themselves for their rape, or to not report their assault, and they can also shape the responses of judges and juries, causing a negative impact on rape victims. Some studies have shown that police officers are often distrustful of rape victims' account of their victimization, and that many of them believe some common rape myths. Also, many who believe even one rape myth typically also do not believe female rape myths any more or any less than male rape myths. Though, men are also more likely to warrant rape myths rather than women. Due to reported higher rape myth acceptance among males than females, as well as because of other gender-based differences in perceptions and standpoints, one analysis by Patricia Yancey Martin, John R. Reynolds and Shelley Keith suggested that \\"a judiciary made up solely of men differs from one made up of more equal proportions of women and men\\". This commentary is furthered by the writings of Mallios and Meisner, who state that rape myth acceptance is problematic in judicial settings. They assert that voir dire can be used to curb jury bias related to preconceived notions regarding rape.Mallios C, Meisner T. Educating juries in sexual assault cases: Using voir dire to eliminate jury bias. Strategies: The Prosecutors’ Newsletter on Violence Against Women, 2010; 2. http://www.aequitasresource.org/EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPart1.pdf This problem is further heightened by the fact that investigative agencies, various participants in the Legal System, and points of contacts for rape victims, for example the nearest doctor, are likelier to be male, than female. The 2015 book Asking for It by Kate Harding talks about common rape myths and about the differences between male and female rapes. One in five women and one in seventy-one men in the United States will find out what it's like to be raped, according to Harding. She writes, \\"Women are no more important than any other potential victims, but we are the primary targets of the messages and myths that sustain rape culture. Anyone can be raped, but men aren't conditioned to live in terror of it, nor are they constantly warned that their clothing, travel choices, alcohol consumption, and expressions of sexuality are likely to bring violations upon them.\\" Such stereotypes reduce the inclination of victims to report instances of rape, harassment, and assault. This reduced reporting of crimes might present a rosy picture and would further the problem, by leading to beliefs that these crimes that are reported are fake, false, or unlikely to be true. In Asking for It, Harding writes of rape that \\"we tend not to treat it as a serious crime unless there's simultaneously evidence of another one\\". The author also quotes psychologist David Lisak. He says that \\"Ultimately, only a tiny handful of rapists ever serve time for rape, a shocking outcome given that we view rape as close kin to murder in the taxonomy of violent crime\\". = Twin myths = The twin myths suggest that a victim’s previous sexual history i) makes them less believable, and/or ii) more likely to consent. Canadian law does allow for the inclusion of previous sexual history, but defence counsel must present a s.276 application and a hearing is held to ensure the evidence will not be used in the context of the twin myths. Rape myth acceptance =Measures= In 1980, Martha R. Burt introduced the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMA, or RMAS). The scale was the first method for measuring an individual's level of belief in rape myths, and became the most widely used. Using Burt's method, rape myth acceptance is measured by asking subjects 19 questions. The first 10 questions each consist of a statement which suggests that rape victims are responsible for their own rape, and ask the subject to assess its truthfulness, rating each statement on a seven-point scale from \\"strongly agree\\" to \\"strongly disagree.\\" The 11th statement tests for the inverse of this idea, asking whether or not it is true that any woman can be raped. The remaining questions ask test subjects to guess the proportion of reported rapes that are false, and assess whether they are more or less likely to believe a rape victim based on the victim's personal characteristics (for example, their gender, their race or ethnicity, their age, or their relationship to the test subject). Burt's original study concluded that many Americans believed in rape myths. More than half of the individuals sampled in her original survey had agreed that \\"a woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man\\" on the first date \\"implies she is willing to have sex,\\" and that in the majority of rapes \\"the victim was promiscuous or had a bad reputation.\\" More than half of Burt's respondents had suggested 50% or more of reported rapes were reported \\"only because the woman was trying to get back at a man\\" or \\"trying to cover up an illegitimate pregnancy.\\" Another measure is the 45-item Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA), developed by Diana L. Payne, Kimberly A. Lonsway, and Louise F. Fitzgerald in 1999. They concluded that \\"rape myth acceptance is most adequately conceptualized as consisting of both a general component and seven distinct myth components: She asked for it; It wasn’t really rape; He didn’t mean to; She really wanted it; She lied; Rape is a trivial event; and Rape is a deviant event\\" The developers of IRMA analyzed responses to a pool of 95 statements about rape to create their scale. Based on the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale, the Chinese Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (CRMA) is a culturally-specific myth scale that measures acceptance of rape myths in Chinese society. The scale operates under a culturally-adapted definition of rape, specifically, in China the legal definition of rape makes no provision for marital rape and does not apply to male victims. Additionally, the definition excludes “types of coercive sexual behavior, such as other forms of penetrative sex, including oral sex, anal sex, and penetrations of the vagina or anus by other body parts like fingers or other objects.” The CRMA retains 25 of 45 items from the IRMA scale and produces a five-factor structure. These myth component factors are: rape victims want to be raped; rape allegations are often false; rape must involve violence; victims are responsible for being raped; and, the motivation to rape is understandable. =Media influence on rape myth acceptance= A 2013 online survey of freshmen at a northwestern university in the United States suggested that women who consumed mainstream sports programming were more likely to accept rape myths, while for both men and women exposure to sports programming decreased the likelihood they would express an intention to intervene if they saw a sexual assault. Another survey carried out online on a research panel in 2011 found that watching soap operas is associated with higher rape myth acceptance, while the reverse was true of watching crime shows.

It may also be called a dominating vertex, as it forms a one-element dominating set in the graph. (It is not to be confused with a universally quantified vertex in the logic of graphs.) A graph that contains a universal vertex may be called a cone. In this context, the universal vertex may also be called the apex of the cone.. However, this terminology conflicts with the terminology of apex graphs, in which an apex is a vertex whose removal leaves a planar subgraph. In special families of graphs The stars are exactly the trees that have a universal vertex, and may be constructed by adding a universal vertex to an independent set. The wheel graphs, similarly, may be formed by adding a universal vertex to a cycle graph.. In geometry, the three-dimensional pyramids have wheel graphs as their skeletons, and more generally the graph of any higher- dimensional pyramid has a universal vertex as the apex of the pyramid. The trivially perfect graphs (the comparability graphs of order-theoretic trees) always contain a universal vertex, the root of the tree, and more strongly they may be characterized as the graphs in which every connected induced subgraph contains a universal vertex.. The connected threshold graphs form a subclass of the trivially perfect graphs, so they also contain a universal vertex; they may be defined as the graphs that can be formed by repeated addition of either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex (one with no incident edges).. Every graph with a universal vertex is a dismantlable graph, and almost all dismantlable graphs have a universal vertex.. Other properties In a graph with vertices, a universal vertex is a vertex whose degree is exactly . Therefore, like the split graphs, graphs with a universal vertex can be recognized purely by their degree sequences, without looking at the structure of the graph.

Located at 37 Kentucky Avenue, it was one of the four popular black nightclubs situated on that street between the mid-1930s and mid-1970s; the others were Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and the Wonder Gardens. The Little Belmont was located across the street from Club Harlem, with which it often shared performers and patrons. Wild Bill Davis and his swing and jazz quartet were featured summer performers from 1950 through the mid-1960s, and Elvera M. \\"Baby\\" Sanchez, mother of Sammy Davis, Jr., worked at the bar. The club closed in the mid-1970s and was later demolished. History =Early history= The Little Belmont Bar was established by Herndon Daniels, a \\"sportsman\\" and numbers banker, in the mid-1930s. By his own testimony, Daniels admitted to being in the numbers business in Atlantic City since 1931, and paying protection money to Atlantic City racketeer Nucky Johnson. In 1932 Daniels was listed as proprietor of the Capital Club, a \\"night life resort\\" in Atlantic City. Alice Dixon Daniels at the cash register of the Little Belmont Bar in 1939 In 1939 Daniels was convicted of Federal income-tax evasion and sentenced to one year and one day at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. Three days before entering prison in October 1939, he married Alice Dixon of Philadelphia, a former showgirl who had performed at New York City's Connie's Inn, Cotton Club, and Kit Kat Club. Alice managed the bar in Daniels' absence together with Isaac (Ike) Nicholson. In May 1941, Daniels testified in U.S. district court that he had perjured himself before the grand jury investigating a link between Atlantic City numbers bankers in the hope that he could resume the numbers business after his release. In July 1940 the Little Belmont, Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and the Wonder Gardens were targeted in a midnight raid by police officers, accompanied by the newly elected mayor, Tom Taggart, seeking proof of illegal gambling activities. The police confiscated \\"three truckloads of gambling paraphernalia\\" and arrested 32, then shut down the four clubs. The arrestees from the Little Belmont included Daniels (then on parole), Nicholson, and 13 others. All the detainees were released on bail, with Daniels' bail set higher than any others, at $5,000. The next day the clubs were open for business as usual. =Postwar= After World War II Daniels married Grace Morgan, owner of Grace's Organic Beauty School and barber shop located at 43 Kentucky Avenue. The couple moved into rooms over the hair salon and Grace managed both the salon and the bar, which was subsequently renamed Grace's Little Belmont. The hair salon, established in 1938, was staffed for many years by barber William \\"Sonny\\" Lea, who bought the business in 1969 after the Daniels' retirement. Lea's celebrity customers included Slappy White, B.B. King, and Muhammad Ali. Grace's Little Belmont attracted both black and white clientele, including \\"celebrities and night- life connoisseurs\\". The most popular shows, however, were the afternoon matinees, attended by beachgoers seeking relief from the summer heat. Guests often circulated between the Little Belmont and Club Harlem across the street, and the same performers played both clubs. After finishing her show at Club Harlem, comedian Moms Mabley sometimes crossed the street and did another routine at the Little Belmont. Boxer Joe Louis often entertained friends here in the late 1930s. In the 1960s, a young George Benson hung out at Grace's Little Belmont with young jazz composer Charles Earland after finishing his late-night set at the Wonder Gardens. The Kentucky Avenue entertainment district went into decline in the late 1960s and further lost business to the hotel casinos opening on the boardwalk in the 1970s. Grace's Little Belmont closed in the mid-1970s and was later demolished. Description The brick facade of the building had an art deco-style entrance with two square glass windows flanking the doorway. Inside, the lounge featured a bar in the shape of a horseshoe and a performance area with a Hammond B3 organ famously played by Wild Bill Davis during his annual summer engagement at the club in the 1950s and 1960s. Booths – considered comfortable by female patrons – lined the walls. Performers Wild Bill Davis in 1954 Sammy Davis, Jr. kisses his mother, \\"Baby\\" Sanchez, at Grace's Little Belmont in 1954 Grace's Little Belmont booked a variety of black orchestras and combos during its 40-year history. In 1934 the Baltimore Afro-American reported that the Little Belmont Bar \\"has got that Harlem atmosphere\\", as it was featuring Israel Thompson's dance orchestra nightly with special appearance by Cotton Club dancer Amy Spencer. In 1949 the bar booked the Loumell Morgan Trio, with musicians on piano, guitar, and bass. In the 1940s, jazz organist Wild Bill Davis began appearing at Grace's Little Belmont; he had a featured summer engagement here from 1950 through the mid-1960s. In 1948 jazz saxophonist Johnny Hodges, then vacationing in the resort town, dropped by the lounge and started jamming with Davis and his jazz quartet. Hodges returned each summer to continue the tradition. In 1966 Davis and Hodges, together with the other three members of Davis' quartet and jazz trombonist Lawrence Brown, recorded their jam session in front of a packed house. Titled Wild Bill Davis and Johnny Hodges in Atlantic City, the LP was released on the RCA Victor label. Davis recorded a second live performance album, Midnight to Dawn, at Grace's Little Belmont in 1967. In July 1952 the club booked jazz pianist Ram Ramirez as a temporary replacement for Wild Bill Davis. In June 1953 it brought in the Johnny Sparrow trio, a popular group from Philadelphia, and a month later, the Billy Taylor trio. In the summer of 1956 Wild Bill Davis introduced his new trio at the lounge, with musicians on organ, piano, and guitar performing both original compositions and pop music. Noted as \\"one of the few, if not the only organist using two amplifiers\\", Davis' performance could be heard for blocks around. Elvera M. \\"Baby\\" Sanchez, formerly a chorus line dancer at the Apollo Theater and mother of Sammy Davis, Jr., began working as a barmaid at Grace's Little Belmont in 1941 after retiring from her show business career at age 35. She enjoyed telling jokes to customers and was known for sporting a gold napkin. Her connections with entertainers Count Basie, Billy Eckstine, and Sarah Vaughn drew these and other celebrities to her station, and her son Sammy would come to visit after performing across town at the 500 Club \\"and delighted everyone pouring drinks and singing\\". Frank Sinatra's valet George Jacobs recalled in his memoirs that Sinatra also liked to drop by Grace's Little Belmont in the early morning hours after his shows at the 500 Club to say hello to Davis' mother behind the bar. Legacy The Hammond B3 organ at Grace's Little Belmont was moved to Our Lady of Sorrows church in Linwood after the club closed. Princeton's Antiques & Books of Atlantic City is in possession of miniature models of Grace's Little Belmont, Club Harlem, and other Kentucky Avenue nightspots fashioned by local artist Joseph Frazier.

Six were built and three variants with more powerful engines flown. Design The two-seat B-4 trainer was a mid-wing monoplane with wings of rectangular plan out to blunted tips. Structurally, the largely wooden wings were based on pairs of box spars and spruce and plywood ribs, with duralumin sheet stiffening the leading edges. The rest of the wing was fabric covered. They were wire-braced from above and below with streamlined wires from pylons within the fuselage to the spars. Its Frise ailerons were inset. The B-4's fuselage was based on a chrome-molybdenum steel frame. It had a American Cirrus III four-cylinder, upright inline engine in the nose with an aluminium firewall and tanks in the wing roots. The two tandem cockpits, fitted with dual controls, were over the wing. The view from the forward cockpit, placed around quarter-chord, was good and the instructor's view from the rear cockpit was improved with windows in the underside wing roots. The B-4's empennage was conventional, framed like the wings and fabric covered. The tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height; its angle of incidence could be varied in-flight for trimming. It carried split, unbalanced elevators. There was a small fin with a curved-topped, straight-edged balanced rudder which extended down to the keel between the elevators. It had conventional, split axle, fixed landing gear with a track. The axles and drag struts were hinged from the same pylon used by the lower wing bracing wires. Struts joined the wheels, enclosed in fairings, to shock absorbers within the wing root aircraft fairings. At the rear the B-4 had a tripod tailskid with a vertical rubber shock absorbing extension of the rudder post. Development The exact date of the first flight of the Emsco Cirrus is not known, though it was flying in mid-November 1929. It was one of the aircraft taking part in the non-competitive First All-California Tour, which ended at Los Angeles on 7 November. This event was intended to advertise the Western Aircraft Show held at Los Angeles from 9–17 November, where the Cirrus was on display. Its tests were complete by January 1930, though it never reached certification, partly because of the departure of its designer, Charles Rocheville, from the firm. His replacement Gerard Vultee, ex-Lockheed, decided to re-engine the sole B-4 with a five-cylinder radial, the Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind. The modified aircraft was designated B-7 and received its Approved Type Rating (ATC) on 21 February 1931. It was longer than the B-4 and was about heavier empty. No other B-7s were built; instead it was followed by the newly built, solitary B-7-C, powered by a Continental A.70 seven-cylinder radial which produced the same power as the Whirlwind. It was longer than the B-4 but was otherwise similar to the B-7, with about the same empty weight, though it had various refinements such as a tailwheel. The B-7-C got its ATC in June 1931. Vultee left Emsco to set up Vultee Aircraft and was replaced by T.V. van Stone, who built another airframe with a Curtiss Challenger six-cylinder radial. Designated B-7-CH, it flew late in 1931. Operational history Little is known about the six B-4s constructed apart from the B-7 conversion. The latter's subsequent career is also obscure. The B-7-C was scrapped in 1946 but its flying life is not recorded. The B-7-CH has a better recorded history. It was used for a time by Scott Flying Services of Long Beach until it was sold in 1936 and flown to Haiti with the intention of starting an internal service there. It returned to New York City where a new owner took it back to the West Coast and sold it on. It was last recorded at the Multnomah School of Aviation in 1950.

It was built in 1939 by F & P Giles. It is also known as Queen's Theatre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 October 2002.  History  The Nostalgic Queen's Theatre is a modest purpose-built picture theatre built in 1939 in the town of Wallumbilla, east of Roma. Wallumbilla was the largest of three small service towns in the Shire of Bendemere (since 2008 amalgamated into the Maranoa Region), whose economy is based on primary production including cattle, grain and timber and on the natural gas industry. Europeans first settled the district in 1854 when Wallumbilla pastoral run was taken up. The township developed as a service town with the coming of the Western railway in 1880. In the 1900s films were brought to Wallumbilla by a traveling projectionist and shown in Bishop's Hall using a hand-cranked projector. At an unknown date the local shopkeeper, Eddie Murphy, purchased the hall and relocated it to the site of the current news agency. He renamed it Murphy's Hall and used it as a picture theatre showing silent films accompanied by piano. The Lumiere Brothers had produced the first moving films in Paris in 1895, followed by Edison Studios in America in 1896, although these early films were very short and simply captured events without a narrative. The first feature movie \\"The Story of the Kelly Gang\\" was made in Australia in 1906 and it was the ability of film to tell a story that was the key to its popularity. At first, films were shown as part of variety shows in theatres or were screened in halls. In the 1900s purpose built picture theatres showing a program of films accompanied by music were built in America, Europe and Australia. Some of those catering to centres with large populations were huge and luxurious, though most were far more modest. Films were much less expensive to show than live theatre and the equipment was easily transported, making them well suited as an entertainment in country areas, some films being displayed by \\"picture show men\\" such as the one who travelled to Wallumbilla. The growing popularity of films led to the construction of many open-air theatres or simple shed-like buildings as permanent venues for showing film. Although theatre chains usually owned the large \\"picture palaces\\" in cities, most small picture theatres in Queensland were independently owned and Queensland eventually had more independently owned theatres than any other state in Australia. These small ventures, frequently family owned, did not have the capital to build lavish premises, nor did they have a large client base in country areas and might screen films only once or twice a week. The Queen's Theatre at Wallumbilla is such a picture theatre. In 1930, Les Cadsow, a baker, bought the Wallumbilla hall and continued to use it as a picture theatre, naming it the De Luxe. It was renamed the Liberty Theatre, presumably when the Second World War broke out, but burned down in 1939. Cadsow bought new projectors with the thought of starting again but could not afford to do so and so he sold the projectors to the Giles brothers from Miles who constructed a new purpose-built picture theatre in 1941. Frank and Paddy Giles were sawmillers and builders and also operated as Rex Touring Pictures. They showed films in Miles, Dulacca, Jackson, Yuleba and Wallumbilla over a weekly circuit. Wallumbilla had the Saturday night screening as it had the largest audience. The Wallumbilla theatre was simple in form with a timber frame clad in fibrous cement sheeting held by timber battens. Laminated arches of cypress pine, which allowed good sightlines to the screen, supported the roof. Timber was also used for the floor and the walls, which were lined with Swedish hardboard for good acoustics, though the roof was unlined. Though simple, the picture theatre aspired to a touch of Hollywood glamour with Chinese lanterns over the lights and pictures of Warner Brothers and MGM stars on the walls. A country picture theatre such as the Queen's provided an important service to people in the surrounding area. Coming into town for a night at the pictures provided good family entertainment, a venue for courtship and an opportunity for people of all ages to meet. Picture theatres showed feature films, newsreels, and cartoons and were often also used for live shows and special events. They provided a stimulus for the imagination and a relief from isolation, particularly in the difficult years of World War II. They were a link with the wider community in Australia and with contemporary American culture as presented by Hollywood. For all these reasons, picture going enjoyed widespread popularity throughout rural Queensland between the 1920s and the advent of competition from television. In 1954 the Giles brothers sold the theatre to Hendrickas Johannes Payne and his wife Violet who ran it in conjunction with the Queen's Cafe across the road and hence the theatre became known as the Queen's Theatre. They upgraded the equipment and screened every Wednesday and Saturday night plus a Saturday matinee until 1962. In August 1962 Rodney and Shirley Houston leased the theatre from Payne. The sound system was modernized and new release movies were shown. To utilize the theatre when films were not being shown, roller-skating was introduced and proved very popular. In 1967 the Houstons bought the cinema and continued to show films even during the early 1970s when television began to displace going to the pictures as the most popular form of entertainment. The Queen's Theatre closed in 1975, but opened for 6 months over the summer of 1981. However, home videos then began to pose serious competition and the Queen's closed for 7 years. It was kept in good repair, however, and in 1988 was able to screen The Man from Snowy River in celebration of Australia's Bicentennial year. Films were shown again in 1993 to celebrate the Wallumbilla School Centenary. Double features were then shown to full houses on two successive nights. This success encouraged the owners to reopen the theatre, renaming it the Nostalgic Queen's Theatre. The equipment was upgraded and a new wide screen installed. The theatre was also connected to mains electricity supply, instead of the generator that had previously provided electricity. The theatre opened again in January 1994 screening on one Saturday night a month during the summer. The Nostalgic Queen's Theatre is still used intermittently to screen films and hosted the Movie Muster, a festival of Australian films, during the Centenary of Federation celebrations in 2001. The exterior cladding on the front of the building was replaced in the 1980s, when the confectionary counter opening onto the street on the right hand side of the entrance was sheeted over. The bottom panels of the fibrous cement sheeting on the side and rear walls has been renewed with equivalent modern sheeting. The interior of the building is still intact.  Description  The Nostalgic Queen's Theatre is situated on the main highway through Wallumbilla. It is a rectangular building with a timber frame. The roof is gabled and the main elevation has a plain rectangular facade clad in metal sheeting with a central doorway below a small window. The sides and rear of the building are clad in fibrous cement panels held in place by timber battens. The interior forms a large rectangular auditorium with a ticket office to the right hand side of the entrance. Laminated timber arches support the roof and the level floor is timber. The walls are lined with vertical timber boards and hardboard sheeting. Canvas layback seats at the rear of the theatre and canvas armchairs at the front provide seating for about 200. The building does not currently have toilets.  Heritage listing  Nostalgic Queen's Theatre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 October 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Nostalgic Queen's Theatre, Wallumbilla is important in demonstrating the development of picture theatres in Queensland and the part that picture going played in the life of Australia in the early and mid 20th century, before it began to be displaced by television. Picture theatres enjoyed widespread popularity, especially in rural areas, as they provided not only entertainment, but also a venue for social interaction and a means of reducing isolation by providing a window into the wider world. The Queen's Theatre is evidence for the popularity of picture going throughout rural Queensland in the mid 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Queen's Theatre is a purpose built picture theatre that is still in use for its original purpose. It is now one of only a few early theatres remaining in Queensland that have not been adapted for other uses. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good example of the type of modest picture theatre once common in rural towns, being very simple in plan and having arches to support the roof to provide good sight lines. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Queen's Theatre has important associations with the community of Wallumbilla and the surrounding area, as a venue for social interaction and popular entertainment, and for many members of which it is a focus for memories.

Leonard and published by the Princeton University press which reevaluates several leading figures of the progressive era of American economics, and points out that many of the so-called \\"progressives\\" of the late 19th and early 20th century who created policies such as minimum wage and maximum-hours laws, workmen’s compensation, progressive income taxes and many others had beliefs rooted in Darwinism, racial science, and eugenics, revealing a dark underside to the economic reformers often considered by history to be the altruists in the story of American economic progression. Overview Illiberal Reformers begins with the history of the gilded age and the progressive era, discussing how the economy shifted from laissez-faire economics to what has come to be called progressivism. Progressivism, by Leonard's definition, is guided by the following core principles \\"First, modern government should be guided by science and not politics; and second an industrialized economy should be supervised, regulated, and investigated by the visible hand of a modern administrative state.\\" Leonard details the three \\"act\\" process of the rise of progressive economics, beginning with higher education leading to the birth of economists, social scientist, as well as the new business of muckraking journalism. The second act in the rise of the progressives was the economic progressives convincing the American people and leaders that change was needed and that laissez-faire was neither economically nor socially justifiable. The final act in the rise of the progressives is that of the policy that came into place; this includes fixed minimum wage, mandatory public schooling, banning of child labor, maximum hours and many others. The second part of Illiberal Reformers focuses on the untold part of the story of the rise of the progressives: the fact that the labor reform created by these progressives often sought to exclude immigrants, the disabled, women, and African American workers from the American workforce, which Leonard explains through several primary sources of the era. Reception In his review for The New Republic, Malcolm Harris praised the book for not only pointing out these seriously underlooked aspects of progressivism and stated that the book feels like a more credentialed version of the book Liberal Fascism. The New York Times wrote a fairly favorable review of the book and made several comparisons to the book Imbeciles by Adam Cohen.

At the time during the early 20th century, many commercial developers such as Jaudon sought to drain and use it as an agricultural area.

A nurse who gives medical aid to vigilantes, she was created for the first season of Daredevil (2015). Dawson then signed a deal to return for the second season of the series (2016), as well as potentially appear in any other Marvel Netflix series. She has since reprised the role in Jessica Jones (2015), Luke Cage (2016–2018), Iron Fist (2017–2018), and The Defenders (2017). The character has also appeared in a Jessica Jones tie-in comic (2015).  Marvel Cinematic Universe  = Television series = After discovering Matt Murdock / Daredevil beaten in a dumpster in Daredevil, nurse Claire Temple gives him aid. She is kidnapped by the mafia for this, as bait for Daredevil, and though he is able to save her, they mutually decide that it is too dangerous to become involved, in spite of the spark between them. Claire does continue to give him medical aid as needed, while Murdock occasionally uses her position at Metro-General Hospital to his advantage. In Jessica Jones, Temple is on duty at the hospital when a seriously injured Luke Cage is brought in; Temple takes care of Cage for Jessica Jones. In the second season of Daredevil, Temple quits her job at the hospital, when it tries to cover up the death of her coworker following an attack by The Hand, and leaves Hell's Kitchen; she arrives in Harlem, where her mother runs a diner, in Luke Cage. Temple reconnects with Cage there, and helps him defend the neighborhood. She falls for Cage, but before they can act on their feelings he is arrested. Temple begins taking lessons at Colleen Wing's dojo, through whom she meets Danny Rand in Iron Fist. Temple helps Rand in his fight against The Hand. In The Defenders, Temple is reunited with Cage, who is let out of jail early thanks to Foggy Nelson, and resumes a relationship with him. She then introduces Cage to Rand. In the second season of Luke Cage, Temple continues her relationship with Cage, but suddenly grows cautious of his personal issues, particularly with his father and the way he handles justice. After an argument, Temple asks that they \\"take a break\\" from each other. By the end of the season, Cage has completely moved on from Temple who tries to enter Harlem's Paradise to see him, but is turned away. = Tie- in comic = Temple appears in the Jessica Jones tie-in comic, serving as Turk Barrett's nurse.  Concept and creation  Rosario Dawson joined the cast of Daredevil in June 2014, and her role was revealed to be that of Temple in October of that year. The MCU character is an amalgam of the comic characters Claire Temple and Night Nurse, with Daredevil showrunner Steven S. DeKnight noting that the character was originally \\"going to be the actual Night Nurse from the comics ... we had her name in a script and it came back that it was possible [the feature side] were going to use her\\" and \\"had plans for her down the road,\\" necessitating the change to using the more obscure comics character Claire Temple as her name. In May 2015, Dawson signed with Marvel to return for the second season of Daredevil as part of an \\"exclusive TV deal\\" that also allows her to appear in any other Marvel/Netflix series. Dawson explained that she signs on with Marvel for a year at a time, for a certain number of episodes, and finds out which series the episodes are for closer to the time of filming. In July, Jessica Jones showrunner Melissa Rosenberg revealed that Dawson would be \\"dropping in\\", with Dawson making a guest appearance in the season finale. Before Jessica Jones debuted that November, a tie-in comic prequel was released featuring several Daredevil and Jessica Jones characters, including Temple, to explore \\"the connective tissue that will build between the series\\". Marvel announced in September 2015 that Dawson would be appearing in Luke Cage, in what Cage actor Mike Colter described as a \\"significant part\\", noting that the comics character Claire Temple was introduced as a love interest for Cage. The series introduces Temple's mother (portrayed by Sônia Braga), and gives Claire \\"a large storyline ... [she helps] out a lot.\\" It also references her role as a version of Night Nurse, with Sean Ringgold's character Sugar dismissively referring to her as \\"the night nurse\\". Explaining the decision to have Temple appear across multiple series, which has been compared to the role that Nick Fury plays as \\"the connective thread\\" between the MCU films, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb explained that it was due to Dawson's performance, saying \\"It wasn't just that Claire fit so well in those worlds, it's that Rosario fit so well in those worlds.\\" When Temple first appears in the second season of Daredevil, she has \\"a cut in her eyebrow\\", which Daredevil actor Charlie Cox explained was from one of the other series, saying that \\"the timeline had been thought through and worked out\\" to connect Dawson's various performances. In July 2016, Dawson was unable to promote Luke Cage because she was \\"back in New York ... filming something else for Marvel TV\\", which was confirmed that October to be Iron Fist; this appearance was set up at the end of Luke Cage. A month later, Dawson was revealed to also be reprising her role in the crossover miniseries The Defenders. Dawson also expressed interest in making a cameo appearance in The Punisher, a spin-off series from Daredevil, but was unable to due to a scheduling conflict. After appearing in the second season of Luke Cage, Dawson explained that she was reluctant to continue making appearances in the many series due to having to travel away from her family when working on the New York sets. She did think that she would return to Luke Cage if it was renewed for further seasons, and again expressed interest in appearing in The Punisher at some point moving forward \\"just so I can feel like I’ve done every show\\". Dawson later revealed that she had asked Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker whether she could contribute to the writing of Temple's last scene in the season; she considered the scene to be the culmination of three years of work for her, and felt that it had initially been written too much from the perspective of Cage, whom Temple has a fight with in the scene that ends their relationship. Dawson praised Coker for allowing her to push the scene to feature more of an equal balance between the characters, and Coker praised the work she did on this.  Characterization  Dawson said in April 2015, \\"she’s someone who also throws herself into the fray and had made it her life mission to help, even if that means risking her own life ... My character is a stand-in for the audience. She’s not a love interest—she’s this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation.\\" On the relationship between Temple and Murdock in Daredevil, Dawson said, \\"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that’s going to be able to see that transition for him ... But she gets confronted with the question: How far will you go? What does it mean if you’re helping someone who is maybe going to hurt other people?\\" Dawson felt that the character resonated with audiences, and was brought back for more series, because, \\"She's funny, she's wry, she's strong—she's built for that world, because she's great under pressure. She's someone—hero or not—you'd want to have in a dire situation... I really just liked her arc all the way through.\\" After the character is shown using fighting in Daredevil, Dawson explained, \\"her eyes have been opened up to this other world—and she's crossed the line. You know, this is someone who helps people, and she's been violent now but seeing the need for it. I think there's a lot that she's having to grapple with\\". Discussing Temple's relationship with Cage in Luke Cage, Colter said that \\"she will deal with me in a different way than she dealt with Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock's character's completely different from mine. Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need ... I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke. I think she's someone that Luke needs in his life at this time.\\" See also *Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  References  Characters created by Drew Goddard Female characters in television Television characters introduced in 2015 Fictional characters from New York City Fictional African- American people Fictional American nurses Fictional female medical personnel Fictional Hispanic and Latino American people Marvel Cinematic Universe original characters Marvel Comics television characters ","title":"Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"},{"id":"51353238","text":"Nevill is an English toponymic surname derived from Neville, may refer to: People ; British peerage *Nevill baronets, two extinct creations, one of 1661 and one of 1675 *House of Nevill (Note: the spellings \\"Nevill\\" and \\"Neville\\" have both been used, often interchangeably) *Viscount Nevill, a junior title of the Marquess of Abergavenny *Edward Nevill, 7th Baron Bergavenny ( - 1588) *Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny ( – 1622) *John Nevill, 10th Baron Bergavenny ( - 1662) *Edward Nevill, 15th Baron Bergavenny ( - 1724) *John Nevill, 3rd Earl of Abergavenny (1789-1845) *William Nevill, 4th Earl of Abergavenny (1792-1868) *Reginald Nevill, 2nd Marquess of Abergavenny (1853-1927) *Guy Larnach-Nevill, 4th Marquess of Abergavenny (1883-1954) *John Nevill, 5th Marquess of Abergavenny (1914-2000) *Patricia Nevill, Marchioness of Abergavenny (1915-2005), friend and Lady of the Bedchamber to Elizabeth II *Lord Rupert Nevill (1923-1982) *Christopher Nevill, 6th Marquess of Abergavenny (born 1955) ; Given name *Nevill Catlin (1634-1702), English landowner and politician *Nevill Coghill (VC) (1852-1879), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross *Nevill Coghill (1899-1980), English literary scholar, known for his modern English version of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales *Nevill Drury (1947-2013), English-born Australian editor, publisher and author *John Nevill Eliot (died 2003), English entomologist *Philip Nevill Green (born 1953), British business executive *Nevill Lee (1898-1978), English cricketer *Nevill Francis Mott (1905-1996), English physicist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1977 for his work on the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems *Nevill Smyth (1868-1941), major-general in the British Army, recipient of the Victoria Cross *Nevill Vintcent (1902–1942), South African aviator and airline founder *Nevill Willmer (1902-2001), British histologist ; Surname *Adam Nevill (born 1969), English writer of supernatural horror stories *Amanda Nevill (born 1957), English arts administrator *Arthur de Terrotte Nevill (1899-1985), New Zealand military aviator and administrator *Arthur Jones- Nevill ( – 1771), Irish politician *Bernard Nevill (1930–2019), British designer and academic *Caroline Emily Nevill (1829–1887), early British photographer *Charles William Nevill (1815-1888), Welsh owner of a copper smelting company and a Conservative Party politician *Christopher Nevill (1800-1847), English cricketer *Cosmo Nevill (1907-2002), British Army officer *Craig Nevill-Manning (active from 2001), New Zealand computer scientist *Lady Dorothy Nevill (1826-1913), English writer, hostess, horticulturist and plant collector *Edmund Neville Nevill (1849-1940), British-born South African astronomer *Geoffrey Nevill (died 1885), British malacologist who worked at the Indian Museum, Kolkata, brother of Hugh *Geoffrey Nevill (died 1972), New Zealand public servant and Resident Commissioner of the Cook Islands *George Nevill (disambiguation), multiple people *Henry Nevill (disambiguation), multiple people *Hugh Nevill (1847-1897), British civil servant, known for his scholarship and studies of the culture of Sri Lanka, brother of Geoffrey *Jim Nevill (1927-2007), British policeman, head of the Scotland Yard Bomb Squad *Luke Nevill (born 1986), Australian basketball player *Mark Nevill (born 1947), Australian politician *Mary Nevill (disambiguation), multiple people *P.

It is claimed to be a functionally selective μ-opioid receptor agonist which produces μ-opioid receptor mediated G protein signaling, with potency and efficacy similar to morphine, but with less β-arrestin 2 recruitment . However, recent reports highlight that this might be due to its low intrinsic efficacy , rather than functional selectivity or 'G protein bias' as initially reported. In tests on mice, PZM21 was slightly less potent than morphine or TRV130 as an analgesic, but also had significantly reduced adverse effects, with less constipation than morphine, and very little respiratory depression, even at high doses. This research was described as a compelling example of how modern high-throughput screening techniques can be used to discover new chemotypes with specific activity profiles, even at targets such as the μ-opioid receptor which have already been thoroughly investigated. More recent research has suggested however that at higher doses, PZM21 is capable of producing classic opioid side effects such as respiratory depression and development of tolerance and may have only limited functional selectivity.

They were emirs (princes) of their namesake tribe, the Banu Numayr. The senior branch of the dynasty, founded by Waththab ibn Sabiq in 990, ruled the Euphrates cities of Harran, Saruj and Raqqa more or less continuously until the late 11th century. In the early part of Waththab's reign (r. 990–1019), the Numayrids also controlled Edessa until the Byzantines conquered it in the early 1030s. In 1062, the Numayrids lost Raqqa to their distant kinsmen and erstwhile allies, the Mirdasids, while by 1081, their capital Harran and nearby Saruj were conquered by the Turkish Seljuks and their Arab Uqaylid allies. Numayrid emirs continued to hold isolated fortresses in Upper Mesopotamia, such as Qal'at an-Najm and Sinn Ibn Utayr near Samosata until the early 12th century, but nothing is heard of them after 1120. As Bedouin (nomadic Arabs), most Numayrid emirs avoided settled life in the cities they controlled; rather, they ruled their emirates (principalities) from their tribal encampments in the countryside, while entrusting administration of the cities to their ghilmān (military slaves). An exception to this situation was Emir Mani' ibn Shabib (r. ca. 1044–1063), under whose reign the Numayrids reached their territorial peak. Mani' resided in Harran itself, transforming its Sabian temple into an ornate, fortified palace. The Numayrids were Shia Muslims and initially recognized the religious sovereignty of the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate, at least nominally, but later switched allegiance to the Shia Fatimid Caliphate after the latter extended its influence into northern Syria in 1037. By 1060, they likely reverted to Abbasid suzerainty. Territory The Numayrids ruled the Diyar Mudar region (western Upper Mesopotamia), controlling the lands between Harran, Saruj and Raqqa more or less continuously between 990 and 1081.Rice 1952, p. 74. For much of this time, they were bordered to the south and west by the Aleppo- based Mirdasid Emirate, to the east by the Mosul-based Uqaylid Emirate, to the north by the Mayyafariqin-based Marwanid Emirate and to the northwest by the Byzantine Empire. The Numayrids, Mirdasids and Uqaylids were Arab dynasties and the Marwanids were Kurds. All were independent, petty dynasties that emerged in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia in the late 10th–early 11th centuries due to the inability of the great regional powers i.e. the Baghdad- based Abbasid Caliphate, the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantines, to control or annex these regions.Rice 1952, pp. 74–75. At different times, the Numayrids paid allegiance and formed loose alliances with all three powers.Rice 1952, p. 75. History =Origins= The Numayrid emirs (princes) belonged to the Banu Numayr tribe, the dynasty's namesake.Bosworth 1996, p. 93. The Banu Numayr were a branch of the Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa' tribe and therefore of Qaysi, or north Arabian, lineage; the Arab tribes were roughly divided into northern and southern Arabian lineages. The name \\"Numayr\\" is likely associated with nimr, the Arabic word for \\"leopard\\".Della Vida 1995, p. 120. Unlike most of the children of 'Amir ibn Sa'sa' who became progenitors of large branches of the tribe, Numayr was thought to have had a different maternal lineage and did not enter into any tribal alliances. For much of their history, the Banu Numayr were an impoverished, nomadic group that mostly engaged in brigandage. They did not enter the historical record until the Umayyad era (668–750 CE) when they dominated the western hills of al-Yamamah in central Arabia. As a consequence of their brigandage, the Banu Numayr were dispersed in an expedition by the Abbasid general Bugha al-Kabir in 846, but recuperated in later decades. Medieval chronicler Ibn al-Adim holds that the Banu Numayr migrated to Upper Mesopotamia from al-Yamamah in 921,Zakkar 1971, p. 70. while historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth puts their arrival as sometime between 940 and 955. This corresponded with the second major, post-Islamic migration of Arab tribes to Syria and Mesopotamia,Heidemann 2005, p. 104. this time in association with the Qarmatian movement.Bianquis 2002, p. 180. Like the Banu Numayr, many of the tribes that formed part of the Qarmatian army were also branches of the Banu 'Amir from Arabia, including the Banu Kilab, Banu Khafaja, Banu Uqayl and Banu Qushayr.Zakkar 1971, pp. 69–70. These Bedouin (nomadic Arab) groups largely uprooted the pre-established, sedentary Arab tribesmen of Upper Mesopotamia, rendered the roads unsafe for travel and severely damaged crop cultivation. According to 10th-century chronicler Ibn Hawqal, > ... the Banu Numayr ... expelled them [peasants and settled Bedouin] from > some of their lands, indeed most of them, while appropriating some places > and regions ... They decide over their protection and protection > money.Heidemann 2005, p. 93. In 942, Banu Numayr tribesmen served as auxiliary troops for an Abbasid governor in Upper Mesopotamia. Six years later, they were employed in the same fashion by Sayf ad-Dawla (r. 945–967), the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo,Sinclair 1990, p. 203. against incursions by the Ikhshidid leader Abu al-Misk Kafur. Not long after, Sayf attempted to check the Bedouin tribes, whose growing strength came at the expense of the settled population. Thus, the Banu Numayr were driven out of Diyar Mudar and took refuge in Jabal Sinjar in Diyar Rabi'a to the east. Along with other Qaysi tribes, the Banu Numayr revolted against Sayf and the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla. The latter expelled them to the Syrian Desert, while in 955/56, Sayf gained their submission, after which he confined them to an area near the Khabur River in Diyar Mudar. By 957, Sayf launched another expedition against the Banu Numayr, who proved to be unruly subjects. =Establishment in Harran= Ruins of Harran, the principal center of the Numayrid dynasty which they held between 990 and 1081 When Sayf died in 967, his Aleppo-based emirate (principality) entered a period of administrative decline. This hampered the Hamdanids' ability to effectively control the southeastern areas of Diyar Mudar, near the hostile Byzantine frontier, necessitating further reliance on the Banu Numayr. To that end, Sayf's successor, Sa'd ad-Dawla, assigned members of the tribe to governorships in cities such as Harran, to which he appointed an emir of the Banu Numayr, Wathhab ibn Sabiq. In 990, the latter rebelled against the Hamdanids and declared an independent emirate in Harran.Sinclair 1990, p. 204. This event marked the establishment of the Numayrid dynasty. Later in 990, Waththab took over the fortified town of Saruj to the west of Harran,Rice 1952, p. 77. and in 1007, he conquered Raqqa from its Hamdanid governor, Mansur ibn Lu'lu'. During his early reign, Waththab also annexed Edessa, north of Saruj, from the Hamdanids, and granted it to his cousin Utayr. The capture of Edessa put the Numayrids in a strategic position vis-a-vis the Byzantines, whose territory bordered Edessa from the north and west. Wathhab died in 1019/20 and was succeeded by his son Shabib. =Reign of Shabib= The Numayrids may have lost control of Harran sometime after Waththab's death.Heidemann 2005, p. 99–100. Furthermore, during Shabib's early reign, Edessa's inhabitants grew increasingly antagonistic toward Utayr, likely because he killed the city's popular deputy ruler. In 1030, Nasr ad-Dawla, the Marwanid emir of Mayyafariqin, intervened on behalf of Edessa's inhabitants, killed Utayr and captured the city. Accounts vary as to whether Nasr ad-Dawla or the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, Salih ibn Mirdas, arbitrated the division of Edessa following Utayr's fall. In any case, a son of Utayr, known in sources only as \\"Ibn Utayr\\", was appointed governor of Edessa's main citadel, while Shibl ad-Dawla, a minor Numayrid emir, was given the city's lesser citadel. Thus, while Edessa remained in Numayrid hands, it was effectively outside of Shabib's control. In 1030/31, negotiations were initiated between the Byzantines and Ibn Utayr or the latter's Marwanid patrons over transferring Edessa's main citadel to Byzantine control; at the time, Ibn Utayr was being challenged by Shibl ad-Dawla of the lesser citadel, prompting either Ibn Utayr or the Marwanids to sell the main citadel to the Byzantine emperor, Romanus III, for 20,000 gold dinars and several villages. After the purchase, Shibl's forces fled, the Muslim inhabitants were massacred and the city's mosques were burned down. Ibn Utayr, meanwhile, apparently relocated to a fortress named after him near Samosata called \\"Sinn Ibn Utayr\\". Terms between Shabib and the Byzantines were reached in 1032 and during delineation of borders, Edessa was left in Byzantine territory, while the rest of Diyar Mudar remained under Numayrid rule. For an undetermined period afterward, Shabib paid tribute to the Byzantines.Rice 1952, p. 44. Because he was unable to effectively challenge the Byzantines, Shabib focused on expanding his domain eastward and northward into Marwanid and Uqaylid territory. In 1033, he assaulted Uqaylid- held Nisibin, but was repelled. The following year he gained Byzantine military backing and advanced against Amid, the Marwanid capital. He retreated after a show of strength by a Marwanid–Uqaylid coalition. Also in 1033/34, the city of Harran was restored to Shabib, on the heel of a severe famine, plague and local uprising. By 1036, Shabib and Ibn Utayr defected from the Byzantines and joined the Marwanid–Uqaylid effort to expel the Byzantines from Edessa.Rice 1952, p. 78.Green 1992, p. 97. The Numayrids captured and looted the city, took several men captive and killed many of the inhabitants. However, they did not seize the citadel and Shabib hastily withdrew to confront a Seljuq threat to Harran. Shabib and the Byzantines made peace in 1037 and Edessa was confirmed as a Byzantine possession. The peace between Shabib and his neighbors freed him up to back his brother-in-law Nasr ibn Salih, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, against the offensive of Anushtakin al- Dizbari, the Damascus-based Fatimid governor of Syria in 1037; The Fatimids were aiming to extend direct control over northern Syria which was held by their nominal vassals, the Mirdasids. The latter were members of the Banu Kilab and as such, distant kinsmen of the Banu Numayr.Bianquis 2002, p. 181. According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the two tribes generally maintained friendly relations,Zakkar 1971, p. 55. and historian Thierry Bianquis holds that the \\"Numayr–Kilab alliance ... controlled all northern Syria and much of western Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia)\\". Shabib's sister, al-Sayyida Alawiyya, who was noted for her intelligence and beauty, was married to Nasr ibn Salih and later played an important role in Aleppan politics. Al-Dizbari killed Nasr ibn Salih in May 1038 and advanced against Aleppo, prompting Shabib, al-Sayyida and Nasr's brother and successor Thimal to retreat to Upper Mesopotamia. Afterward, al-Sayyida married Thimal. By 1038 Shabib paid allegiance to the Fatimids and ordered Caliph al-Mustansir to be recognized as the Islamic sovereign in Friday prayers. This marked a formal break with the Abbasid Caliphate, whose religious legitimacy the Numayrids had previously acknowledged. =Struggle for Raqqa= Mani ibn Shabib sold the Qal'at Ja'bar fortress to the Fatimid governor Anushtakin al-Dizbari, but repossessed it following the latter's death in 1041. Shabib died without an adult heir in 1039/40, and as a result, Numayrid territory was split between his brothers Muta'in and Qawam, who jointly held Harran and Raqqa,Sinclair 1990, pp. 204–205.Heidemann 2005, p. 96. and a certain Hasan, apparently a son of Shabib,Rice 1952, p. 79. who ruled Saruj. Shabib's death saw the start of a long feud between the Banu Numayr and Banu Kilab over Raqqa and the fertile pastures surrounding that city. At the time of Shabib's death, al-Sayyida lived in al-Rafiqah, immediately adjacent to Raqqa, having moved there with Thimal after the Fatimid occupation of Aleppo. She sought to seize Raqqa from her brothers' deputy governor, and married Thimal \\"to uphold her authority and safeguard her interests\\", according to Ibn al-Adim. Thimal took over Raqqa, thereby expanding the Banu Kilab's tribal territory over the entire area between the Balikh and Euphrates rivers. Around the same time, al-Dizbari, wary of Thimal's growing power base in Upper Mesopotamia, purchased the Qal'at Ja'bar fortress, north of Raqqa, from Shabib's son Mani'. When al-Dizbari died in 1041, Mani' immediately repossessed Qal'at Ja'bar.Rice 1952, p. 80. By then, Thimal reconciled with the Fatimids and was restored to Aleppo. Tensions over Raqqa increased when Mani' came of age and took charge of the Banu Numayr between 1044 and 1056. Mani' viewed himself as the rightful heir to Shabib's possessions and sought to retrieve them by force.Heidemann 2005, p. 97. He switched the Numayrids' formal allegiance from the Fatimids to the Seljuq sultan Tughril Beg of Baghdad, who sent Mani' robes of honor and issued a decree granting him Raqqa. In April 1056, after Thimal rejected Mani's Demand to withdraw from Raqqa, hostilities broke out between the two sides. By then, Mani' had already seized Harran from his uncles.Sinclair 1990, p. 205. The Fatimids attempted to stabilize the situation in Upper Mesopotamia and assist the anti-Seljuq general Arslan al-Basasiri, whom they sought to use to invade Iraq.Heidemann 2005, pp. 97–98. The Fatimid envoy, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, held a highly negative view of Mani' and leaned towards supporting Thimal, but was later convinced by the chieftain of the Banu Mazyad in al-Basasiri's camp that Mani' was essential to the anti-Seljuq cause.Heidemann 2005, p. 98. Al- Mu'ayyad persuaded Mani' to defect to the Fatimids. In reward, al-Basasiri captured Raqqa from Thimal and transferred it to Mani' in October 1057. According to chronicler Ibn Shaddad, al-Basasiri did not capture Raqqa; rather, Thimal handed over both Raqqa and al-Rafiqah to Mani' due to military pressure.Zakkar 1971, p. 150. =Zenith= Thimal's surrender of Raqqa was part of a greater power shift in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia as Thimal was also compelled by the Fatimids to evacuate Aleppo in January 1058.Heidemann 2005, p. 99. Meanwhile, Mani' was given large amounts of money by the Fatimids to secure his support for al-Basasiri's campaign. These sums enabled Mani' to firmly establish himself in Harran by constructing a palace- citadel there at the site of the former Sabian temple. In January 1059, al- Basasiri managed to drive out the Seljuqs from Baghdad, overthrow the Abbasid caliph al-Qa'im (r. 1031–1059, 1060–1075) and proclaim Fatimid suzerainty over Baghdad.Heidemann 2005, p. 102. By then, Mani' was wealthier and more powerful than ever.Rice 1952, p. 81. The Numayrids did not assist al-Basasiri in this campaign despite their formal alliance. In the meantime, Mani' sought to buttress the Numayrid realm in case of an Abbasid–Seljuq resurgence in Iraq; the lack of support to both Mani' and al-Basasiri from Cairo, which had just experienced significant political changes, may have persuaded Mani' to return to the Abbasid–Seljuq fold. That year, Mani' extended Numayrid territory to its southernmost extent by capturing the Khabur/Euphrates-area fortress towns of al-Rahba and al-Qarqisiyah (Circesium). Moreover, he gave refuge in Harran to al-Qa'im's four-year-old grandson and heir apparent, Uddat ad-Din, who had been smuggled out of Baghdad. In 1060, after al-Basisiri's forty-week reign came to an end with his defeat and execution by the Seljuqs, Mani' married one of his daughters to Uddat ad-Din to establish ties with the caliph's family. Uddat ad-Din was then returned to Baghdad with many gifts and would later succeed al-Qa'im, who had since regained his throne. Though not explicitly mentioned in contemporary chronicles, Mani' likely reverted his allegiance to the Abbasids in the aftermath of al-Basasiri's defeat. According to historian D. S. Rice, the Numayrids greatly benefited from the \\"Basasiri incident\\", having gained Raqqa from the Mirdasids and given large sums by the Fatimids \\"without committing themselves\\" to the \\"hazardous enterprise\\" of participating in al-Basasiri's coup attempt. The period between 1058 and 1060 represented the peak of Numayrid power. =Decline and fall= In 1060, Mani' backed his nephew and Mirdasid ruler, Mahmud ibn Nasr (son of Nasr ibn Salih and al- Sayyida Alawiyya), against Thimal's attempt to take back Aleppo. Mahmud was ultimately defeated and given refuge by Mani'. Al-Sayyida Alawiyya then intervened and mediated a truce between Thimal and Mani'. Nonetheless, the latter saw another serious setback at the hands of the Mirdasids when Thimal's brother, Atiyya ibn Salih, took over Raqqa in 1062.Rice 1952, pp. 81–82. Not long after, in either July 1062 or April 1063, Mani' died of a seizure,Heidemann 2005, p. 103.Rice 1952, p. 82. leaving no capable successor. Heidemann asserts that with Mani's death, \\"the Banu Numayr lost much of their importance and soon fell into oblivion\\". The expansion of Seljuq power into Syria and Upper Mesopotamia after their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 threatened the Numayrid emirate; the Byzantine defeat deprived both the Numayrids and the Mirdasids of a powerful protector. In 1081, the Uqaylid emir Muslim ibn Quraysh, backed by the Seljuqs, conquered Harran from Mani's successor(s), whose names were not recorded in the sources. According to medieval historian Ibn al-Athir, Ibn Quraysh appointed Yahya ibn ash-Shatir, a Numayrid ghulām (slave) and administrator who assisted Ibn Quraysh, as governor of Harran, while another medieval chronicler, Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, claims a certain Ja'far al-Uqayli was made governor and promoted Shia Islam there. That same year, the Uqaylids wrested control of Saruj from Hasan, who had held it continuously since 1039. Hasan was given Nisibin in exchange and ruled that city as an Uqaylid vassal. Qal’at an-Najm was the last recorded possession of the Numayrids In 1083, Abu Jalaba, the Hanbali qadi (chief Islamic judge) of Harran, and a Numayrid emir (either Ibn Utayr or a certain Ibn Atiyya an-Numayri) led a revolt against the Uqaylids in 1083; The rebels fought in the name of a Numayrid child prince, Ali ibn Waththab, possibly a young son of Mani', and took over the town for a short period. By the end of the year, the uprising was suppressed by Ibn Quraysh, who executed Abu Jalaba, the latter's sons and about one hundred other participants. Ibn ash-Shatir continued to administer Harran after Ibn Quraysh's death in 1085 and was re-confirmed in his post by the Seljuq sultan Malik-Shah in 1086.Rice 1952, pp. 82–83. The advent of the Seljuqs and affiliated Turkmen tribal forces at this time effectively put an end to the reign of Arab tribal powers, including the Banu Numayr, in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. Despite the loss of their capital and much of their power, the Numayrids maintained a presence in the region into the 12th century, holding onto a few fortresses that were isolated from each other, including Qal'at an-Najm on the northern Euphrates and Sinn Ibn Utayr.Rice 1952, p. 83. According to Rice, the Banu Numayr \\"were still spasmodically active\\" during this period. In 1101, they killed the Uqaylid emir, Ibn Quraysh's son Muhammad ibn Muslim, at Hit,Ibn al- Athir, ed. Richards 2010, p. 65. and four years later led an abortive raid against the Seljuq general Afshin.Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, p. 105. In 1110, the Numayrids, led by a certain Jawshan an-Numayri, seized Raqqa from its Turkmen governor Ali ibn Salim, who they killed,Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards 2010, pp. 139–140. but were dislodged a short time later. The Crusaders, who had entered the region at the beginning of the century, captured Sinn Ibn Utayr from the Numayrid emir Mani' ibn Utayr an-Numayri in 1118. The medieval chronicler al-Azimi recorded that the Numayrids still held Qal'at an-Najm in 1120, but nothing else is heard of the Numayrids in the following centuries. Based on his research, Rice found that as of 1952 the descendants of the Banu Numayr continued to live in and around Harran and were known as the Nmēr, a colloquial form of \\"Numayr\\", and belonged to the confederation of Jēs, a colloquial form of \\"Qays\\". He also noted that they were unaware \\"that their ancestors had once been, for nearly a century, the 'Lords of Raqqa, Saruj and Harran'\\". Culture =Government= Numayrid family tree Once in power, the Numayrids resolved to protect, govern and tax the communities inhabiting the agricultural territories and towns they controlled, rather than plunder them. This made them similar to the Bedouin tribes of Banu Kilab in northern Syria and the Uqaylids in Diyar Rabi'a. In contrast, other Bedouin contemporaries of the Numayrids, particularly the Jarrahids in Transjordan and Palestine, pillaged their territory and consistently attacked the populace. Nonetheless, the Numayrids retained aspects of their nomadic lifestyle, including an apprehension to living in urban environments. As such, Numayrid emirs and chieftains refrained from residing within the cities they controlled; instead, they formed mini-principalities in the countryside surrounding their respective strongholds. Administration over the cities, including taxation, was entrusted to a deputy who ruled in the emir's name. The deputy was typically a ghulām. An exception to this system was Mani', who resided in Harran itself. According to Heidemann, > The building activities in Harran and probably those in Raqqa are proof that > Mani' did not regard cities only as places for fiscal exploitation. He also > wanted to present himself within the city as an urban ruler, while > maintaining his powerbase, the Banu Numayr, in the pasture. The Numayrids, like their Marwanid neighbors, used the title of amir (prince).Rice 1952, p. 57. The Numayrid emirs Shabib and Mani' also used the Fatimid-influenced titles ṣanīʿat ad-dawla and najīb ad-dawla, respectively. They likely adopted these titles during periods of formal allegiance with the Fatimids. The Numayrids established mints at Harran, and under Mani', at Raqqa as well.Heidemann 2005, p. 101. The names of the ruling Numayrid emirs were named on the coins, which in the medieval Islamic era symbolized sovereign rulership. =Architectural legacy= In 1059, during his zenith, Mani' transformed the Sabian temple of Harran into an ornate, fortified residence.Heidemann 2006, pp. 130–131. Excavations of Harran's modern citadel revealed that Mani's construction partly consisted of two small, square basalt towers connected to each other by a decorated arch. Fragments of a Kufic inscription found at a basaltic block at the citadel indicates the palace's construction in 1059.Rice 1952, p. 53. Rice states that the inscription represents the \\"oldest Islamic text so far found at Harran and the only surviving epigraphic document of the Numairid dynasty\\". Heidemann holds that there was likely building activity during Mani's reign in Raqqa and the adjacent town of al-Rafiqah, including the possible restoration of a congregational mosque in the latter town. However, there are no specifically identifiable traces of Numayrid construction in Raqqa/al-Rafiqah. =Religion= Like the Hamdanids, Fatimids, and Banu Kilab/Mirdasids, much of the Banu Numayr followed Shia Islam. Initially, they paid formal allegiance to the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate, but during Shabib's last years, they switched to the Shia Muslim Fatimid Caliphate. Under Mani', the Numayrids reverted to the Abbasids, then recognized the Fatimids in 1056–1059 before once again nominally returning to the Abbasid fold.

The facility opened in its current form in October, 1994, and houses a maximum of 1500 at a range of security levels from minimum to super maximum. The site was first founded in 1918 as the Connecticut State Farm and Reformatory for Women. As of 1930, the facility had expanded, and was renamed the Niantic Correctional Institution. It composes of a minimum side and maximum side. Average age of women is 35.  History  = Founding = Throughout the 1800s in Connecticut, women who committed crimes were imprisoned at the same prisons as men--Old Newgate Prison in Granby and the State Prison in Wethersfield--and kept separate from the male prisoners. In 1911, the Connecticut Prison Association proposed creating a commission to study establishing a reformatory for women, an effort that was supported by suffragists and members of the Daughters of the American Revolution. It was not until 1917 that the General Assembly approved a bill to establish the Connecticut State Farm and Reformatory for Women. According to the law, the site had to be at least 200 acres, with woodland, tillable pasture, and a natural water supply. It also had to be close to a railroad. The law also stipulated that girls aged sixteen years and over could be committed to the State Farm for up to three years. In July 1917, Governor Marcus H. Holcomb appointed a commission to select a site, construct buildings, and start the State Farm. The committee selected a location of 700 acres surrounding Bridge Lake in East Lyme, Connecticut. Existing houses and farm buildings were renovated for the new facility. = Early years = The Connecticut State Farm and Reformatory for Women opened in 1918, with 12 inmates. It was a working farm, and the incarcerated women worked on the farm and engaged in recreational activities, such as square dancing and hobby classes; they also had the use of a library and worship room. A hospital was built at the facility during World War I, motivated in part by the increase in sexually transmitted diseases. The State Farm also had a nursery to care for the children of the incarcerated women. The State Farm was a more comfortable place than the Wethersfield State Prison, in that hygiene and privacy were taken seriously, there was less risk of physical or sexual attack, and the staff and administration were mostly female. However, sexism and racism still prevailed. = Niantic Correctional Institution = In 1930, after an addition was constructed, the facility was renamed the Niantic Correctional Institution. There were opportunities for the incarcerated women to engage with the local community. To celebrate Connecticut's tercentenary in August 1935, there was a fair, which included a dance floor, wheels of fortune, and displays of livestock and vegetables. The State Farm also sold milk, butter, and cheeses to Seaside, Mystic Oral school, and Norwich State Hospital. In the 1960s, the state stopped farming operations in order to save money. Then, the facility began to focus more on educational programs. During the 1960s and 1970s, psychology researcher conducted studies at the prison, including Harvard psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, who set up a laboratory in one of the women's colleges. = Later years = The Department of Correction assumed management of the Niantic Correctional Institution in 1968. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the prison faced overcrowding. In 1983, five female inmates sued the Commissioner of the Department of Correction for not providing several services. As a result of the settlement, a 20-bed mental health unit and halfway house was set up in Waterbury for female offenders and their children. Women also would have a space to meet privately with their children. In 1991, Doe v. Meachum required Connecticut's prison officials to provide AIDS education to inmates. The facility is now named after Janet S. York, who served as the prison's superintendent from 1960-1968 and later became deputy commissioner of women's services for the Connecticut Department of Correction.

The town on the Dandenong Creek grew rapidly and, in 1863, citizens from the recently established Dandenong Improvement petitioned the government for approval to establish a public market in their growing town.A Concise History of Dandenong Markets by Jenny Ferguson The first market day was Tuesday, 10 October 1866. An early advertisement stated that for sale would be: \\"A choice lot of dairy cows, with calves; heifers springing, 50 head store cattle, a quantity of useful horses, fat and store pigs, well-bread rams, poultry, potatoes, and other produce; drays, spring-cart and farming implements, &c.;\\" It also noted \\"Lunch will be provided.\\" The Argus Thursday 4 October 1866, via the National Library of Australia At first held fortnightly, the market was soon a weekly event.

He was also a teacher at the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a co-founder of the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, and founder of the lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press. Biography Poska was born to Lithuanian parents in Scotland in 1938. At age 10, he and his parents immigrated to the United States, and settled in Rockford, Illinois. After receiving degrees from Rockford College and Cranbrook Academy of Art, he became an instructor at Rockford College, then in 1963, moved to Milwaukee, where he taught at the Layton School of Art. When Layton closed, he co-founded the Milwaukee School of Art and Design and taught there. In 1963, while attending Cranbrook, Poska was introduced to papermaking by Laurence Barker, the dean of the school's graphics department. In 1967, he purchased his first \\"beater\\", a machine that grinds rags and pulp in the initial step of producing handmade paper, and established his lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press. At the time, his lithography press was among the largest in the United States, using blocks of stone. Under the Fishy Whale imprint, Poska and artist John Doyle produced The Great Human Race, a series of prints designed by Doyle that appear in the collections of a number of American museums. Poska continued to develop The Great Human Race as a perpetual art and philosophy project for over 30 years. He would go on to be recognized as a pioneer in the artistic medium of papermaking. By 1984, Poska was a nationally known artist. That year, he received a commission to produce a long painting From Blue to Blue, which was displayed on Main Street in Rockford before its installation in Milwaukee's Henry S. Reuss Federal Plaza Building. This piece was produced in sections high and long, and then assembled to complete the full installation. His works are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. In his later years, Poska became an outspoken activist for equality and common human rights, and was a frequent speaker at Rockford town hall meetings. He died on February 2, 2017, in Rockford.

He is perhaps best known for being the person who shot and killed fellow American Indian Movement activist Anna Mae Aquash. Early life Graham was born in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada and is a member of the Southern Tutchone Champagne and Aishihik First Nations ethnic group. One source indicates that Graham is from Haines Junction, Yukon. Graham's birth year falls somewhere between the years of 1954 and 1957. In 1974, when Graham participated in the Native People's Caravan in 1974, he was 17 years, meaning he was either born in 1957, or would be turning 18, and thus born in 1956 and 1957. Several sources also identify Graham as being 55-years-old at the time the guilty verdict was read. This would place his year of birth at 1954 (if he was 55-year-olds, and going on 56) or 1955 (if he had turned 55-years-old). Personal life John Graham is a father of eight who was living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Career Graham had spent many years in the capacity of an activist. He was known to participate in Lakota resistance for traditional territories, and protesting uranium mining Northern Saskatchewan. In 1974, when Graham was 17, he participated in the Native Peoples' Caravan from Vancouver to Ottawa, an unauthorized occupation event in which 300 participants from the Caravan moved into the abandoned Carbide Mill building on Victoria Island, behind the Parliament buildings in Ottawa, for 5 months. Graham was also active in protest throughout other Canadian provinces. In Vancouver, Graham also participated as a member the Beothuck Patrol, a First Nations group which conducted street level monitoring of police harassment. In June 1980, the Caravan for Survival, which included Graham as a protester, consisted of who drove from Regina, Saskatchewan, the capital city of Saskatchewan, to the northern Saskatchewan uranium boom town of La Ronge to protest the opening of government-operated Key Lake Uranium Mine Board of Inquiry. Following the conclusion of the Native Peoples' Caravan, Graham partook in his first armed occupation when he traveled to the state of New York group to provide support (as general security) to the Mohawk land re- occupation at Ganienkeh, also known as Eagle Lake. During the summer 1981, the AIM Survival Group, which included John Graham, opened the Anne Mae Aquash Survival Camp near the community of Pinehouse, located in northern Saskatchewan, on the Key Lake road, which was done to create a forum in which Native rights issues and the problems of the uranium industry could be openly discussed (it is said that Graham named the camp in honor of Anna Mae). During the months of May and June in 1984, John Graham spoke throughout Europe, which was organized by European anti-nuclear, native rights and environmental groups to raise understanding and awareness of on native rights and the environmental problems of uranium mining in Canada faced by the First Nations people. Legal history =Murder of Anna Mae Aquash= Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash was a prominent voice and female activist within the ranks of the American Indian Movement. On 12 December 1975, Aquash was forced out of the home of Denver AIM Troy Lynn S. Yellow Wood despite the latter's objection that something bad would happen to Aquash, and she was taken to an apartment in Rapid City owned by Russell Means' brother, and during interrogation, she was raped by Graham. Looking Cloud, one of Graham's and Nelson-Clark's accomplices, indicated that he heard Graham and Aquash having sex in the bedroom of a Rapid City apartment (whose ownership is attributed to Thelma Rios and her mother), which led to prosecutors alleging that Graham raped Aquash. Looking Cloud waited outside of the room while Graham raped Aquash, and Graham acknowledged in a taped interview/interrogation that Looking Cloud waited outside of the room Anna Mae was imprisoned inside of. Aquash was then forcefully moved to the Rosebud Indian Reservation where AIM supporters refused to house her. Looking Cloud, along with Theda Nelson Clarke and Graham, forced Aquash into the back of a car and drove her to a remote part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where Aquash was shot execution style in the back of the head and left to die. Her body was located nearly two months later on 24 February 1976 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation at the bottom of a ravine located in close proximity to an isolated highway. Aquash was revealed to have been murdered with a firearm, as the autopsy showed that the muzzle of the gun had been pressed into the back of her neck. The coroner's report indicated that in addition to the fatal gunshot wound, exposure caused the death of Aquash, as her body was frozen by the time it was discovered. Graham indicated that he and his family were visited several times in the Yukon during the 1990s, and allegedly threatened to charge him with murder if he did not falsely identify AIM leadership for the murder. =Arrest= On 30 March 2003, Graham was charged with the 1975 first-degree murder/pre-meditated murder of Anna Mae in the United States. Because Graham was a resident of Vancouver at the time, the case required Graham's extradition. On 1 December 2003, Graham was arrested in Vancouver for the murder of Pictou-Aquash, and his bail was set at $50,000.00. Graham resisted extradition, and despite being put under house arrest in December 2003, he filed an appeal within British Columbia to keep the case from moving forward. On 23 June 2006, the presiding judge extended Graham's bail to 23 June 2006, giving Graham's lawyer, Terry LaLiberte time to file an appeal following the British Columbia Supreme Court's decision to extradite Graham. Graham lost the appeal, had his bail revoked and he was taken to jail to await extradition, which happened on 6 December 2007. =United States v. Graham= John Graham was charged in the United States on 30 March 2003 with the 1975 first-degree murder/pre-meditated murder of Anna Mae. After protracted litigation in the federal courts, the federal premeditated murder charge was dismissed in United States v. Graham, 572 F.3d 954 (8th Cir.2009). =State of South Dakota v. Graham= However, before Graham could return to Canada, he was indicted by a Pennington County grand jury on state charges of premeditated murder and felony murder. The underlying felony was alleged to be the kidnapping of Aquash. On 2 December 2010, South Dakota Judge John Delaney forbade any mention of a finding in the first autopsy report for Aquash that suggests she may have had sex shortly before her death to jurors, a finding which prosecutors said originated from Graham allegedly raping Aquash during her kidnapping. On 3 December 2010, Nichols-Ecoffey testified that an AIM activist later convicted of killing two FBI agents made an \\"incriminating\\" statement in front of her and Aquash, who was later shot and killed. The \\"incriminating\\" statement referred to Peltier's admission by \\"shooting the motherf***** that was begging for his life, and still shooting him.\\" Ecoffey, the former common-law wife of AIM leader Dennis Banks, was forbidden by Circuit Court Judge John Delaney from telling jurors exactly what she alleges group member Leonard Peltier told her six months before Aquash was killed. The judge deemed it hearsay. But under questioning from prosecutors, she was allowed to say that Peltier made an \\"incriminating\\" statement. Graham was convicted of felony murder on 10 December 2010 after jurors heard evidence that he aided in the abduction of Aquash from Denver in December 1975. Graham was sentenced to minimum mandatory life in prison for the murder. =2012 Appeal= Graham continued to maintain his innocence and attempted to secure an appeal that would grant him a release from prison. The South Dakota Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding his 2010 conviction on 19 March 2012 in Vermillion, South Dakota. Graham's attorney, John Murphy, argued that the government should not have had the authority to transfer his case from federal to state jurisdiction following his extradition to the US, the South Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the state was within its rights to prosecute Graham, there was sufficient evidence to convict Graham, and his life-sentence imprisonment without parole was commensurate with the crime committed. The South Dakota Supreme Court thus dismissed the John Graham Appeal. Graham is currently incarcerated at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.http://www.grahamdefense.org/ =2018 Appeal= On 30 March 2018, Graham appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on the premise that, \\"the court lacked jurisdiction over him because he is a Canadian citizen whose extradition allegedly violated a treaty,\\". Graham's legal defense argued that his 2011 conviction in South Dakota was for felony murder, a crime which does not exist in Canada, and a crime that was not mentioned his extradition request. However, the Eighth Circuit ultimately upheld Graham's conviction, and his appeal was denied. The three-judge panel concurred that felony murder was not written in the original extradition request authored by the United States. However, the subsequent waiver issued by Canada expanded the authority of the extradition, and, based on the Eight Circuit Court's opinion, it is beyond the Eight Circuit's jurisdiction to interpret Canadian laws. Legacy Graham's trial and sentencing have been the subject of both scrutiny and controversy. There are accounts which indicate that 'John Graham' and 'John Boy Patton' are not the same person. The \\"John Boy Patten\\" in question is the nephew of Theda Nelson Clarke (Patten's mother, Corky Nelson Patten, is the sister of Theda Nelson Clarke), is around the same age as Graham, and bears a striking resemblance to Graham. This view is corroborated by Graham's attorney, Terry LaLiberte, who indicated that the U.S. was looking for a Caucasian male, 188 cm tall (approximately 6 ft. 2 in), weighing 87 kg (approximately 192 lbs.), and that \\"the guy they [the U.S.] want is six inches taller than Mr. Graham, and there is a problem with the weight and the racial description.\\" Additionally, LaLiberte has disputed that his client was known by the name John Boy Patton. \\"Also known by whom? We have requested that they clarify these points, and they have not proffered that evidence.\\" There are also factions which claim Graham's imprisonment was the result of a corporate cover-up. Around the time Graham's appeal against extradition was denied, Cash Minerals Ltd., a Canadian-based company whose objective was to further uranium exploration in the Yukon, discovered uranium near Graham's property. Following Graham's extradition to the United States, the John Graham Defense Committee was formed. The organization's intent is to prove his innocence. Despite Looking Cloud's plea bargain which involved testifying against John Graham in exchange for a reduction in his prison sentence, the Graham Defense Committee indicated that it would help Looking Cloud form a legal appeals team. According to a representative from the Graham Defense Committee, in addition to Looking Cloud's conviction being based on a lack of forensic evidence, they also indicated that, \\"Yet the Graham Defense committee will help form a legal appeals team for Looking Cloud. Why help him when he implicated John? We don't believe he intended to implicate John.\\" See also *American Indian Movement *Arlo Looking Cloud *Theda Nelson Clarke *Darlene Nichols *Anna Mae Pictou- Aquash *Uranium mining and the Navajo people References External links * 20th-century First Nations people 21st-century First Nations people 20th-century Canadian criminals Canadian people convicted of murder First Nations activists Members of the American Indian Movement Canadian kidnappers Canadian rapists People from Whitehorse, Yukon Indigenous peoples in Yukon 1975 murders in the United States Native American history of South Dakota 1970s in South Dakota Crimes in South Dakota Deaths by firearm in South Dakota Kidnappings in the United States Rapes in the United States People convicted of murder by South Dakota Living people 1954 births People extradited from Canada to the United States Canadian male criminals ","title":"John Graham (Canadian activist)"},{"id":"51353721","text":"Waterloo Ridge Lutheran Church is located northwest of the unincorporated community of Dorchester, Iowa, United States.

The album/DVD Living in a Dream was released in 2009, containing live renditions of previously released Arc Angels songs, new songs performed live and three newly recorded studio tracks. The Living in a Dream tour was launched at Austin's annual South by Southwest Festival. Following the tour the band never officially broke up again but the band members pursued solo projects with Sexton rejoining Bob Dylan's band and Bramhall resuming his solo career and work with Eric Clapton.http://db2music.com/about There have been no talks about future Arc Angels releases or concerts to this date.

Because the concert was performed in an outdoor amphitheater and there was some intermittent rain on the night of the recording the footage is somewhat incomplete, but all the gaps were filled by some road scenes, shots from other Arc Angels concerts from around the same time, and a few random shots. The DVD also contains a documentary of the band and a tribute to Clifford Antone, the late, great blues club owner who nurtured the Austin blues music scene into the mammoth it is today. The documentary is essentially the band speaking directly to the camera about their views on the debut album and its subsequent tour. The Antone tribute is a continuation of the documentary, with the group members offering their thoughts on the importance of Antone to their careers and blues as a whole.http://somethingelsereviews.com/2010/02/10/the-arcangels-living-in-a- dream-2009-cd-dvd/ Track listing =Disk One= #\\"Paradise Cafe\\" #\\"Carry Me On\\" #\\"The Famous Jane\\" #\\"Good Time\\" #\\"She's Alright\\" #\\"Always Believed in You\\" #\\"Sent by Angels\\" #\\"Crave and Wonder\\" #\\"Sweet Nadine\\" #\\"See What Tomorrow Brings\\" #\\"Shape I'm In\\" #\\"Living in a Dream\\" #\\"Too Many Ways to Fall\\" =Disk Two= #\\"Crave and Wonder\\" #\\"What I'm Looking For\\" #\\"Too Many People\\" #\\"Spanish Moon\\" Personnel *Doyle Bramhall II - guitar, vocals *Charlie Sexton - guitar, vocals *Chris Layton - drums *Tommy Shannon - bass (live tracks) *Dave Mansey - bass (studio tracks) References Arc Angels albums 2009 albums Blues rock albums by American artists ","title":"Living in a Dream (album)"},{"id":"51353793","text":"\\"An Old Master\\" is a poem by Australian poet C.

[it] conveys to the reader the power wielded by the old bullock driver, who, by his eloquence in hard swearing, could get more work out of a team than any of the gentle Annie variety of puncher of the present day. The team, on this occasion, was hopelessly bogged, bogged over the axles down to the bed. Bullock whip had no effect on the team, and they stood there chewing their cud, refusing to budge. An old pensioner, who lived in a hut on the roadside, seeing the dilemma, took the whip, and for a while the atmosphere in the vicinity went blue from the oaths that flew from the old fellow, who had not exhausted his vocabulary when the bullocks bent to their yoke, and lifted the waggon from the gluepot.

It was discovered in 2010 and is a common component of the skin flora in healthy adults. There is limited evidence from case reports linking the virus to a skin rash occurring in immunocompromised organ transplant recipients. Discovery HPyV7 was first discovered in 2010 by rolling circle amplification, a genetic technique that efficiently amplifies and detects circular DNA, such as a polyomavirus genome. It was identified as a component of skin flora in healthy adults, along with Merkel cell polyomavirus (which can cause Merkel cell cancer) and Human polyomavirus 6. Taxonomy HPyV7 is closely related to HPyV6, which was discovered at the same time; the two viruses' genomes share 68% sequence identity. In the 2015 taxonomic update to the polyomavirus group, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classified HPyV7 in the genus Deltapolyomaviridae. This group contains only four viruses, all of which infect humans: HPyV6 (the type species), HPyV7, MW polyomavirus, and STL polyomavirus. Prevalence All known human polyomaviruses are fairly common in healthy adult populations and are usually asymptomatic. In studies that profile polyomavirus seroprevalence, or prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins indicating either past or present exposure in immunocompetent adults, estimates of HPyV7 prevalence have ranged from approximately 35–85%, with evidence of low prevalence among children and increasing prevalence with age. The age- dependent pattern of seroprevalence featuring a decline at around six months old is consistent with the transmission of maternal antibodies. A study of cutaneous viruses in men found prevalence of HPyV7 DNA—indicating actively replicating virus—at around 2%. Another similar study reported HPyV7 DNA prevalence at around 14%, with 10% showing persistent viral shedding over time. Clinical manifestations As with many recently discovered human polyomaviruses, the clinical significance of HPyV7 is poorly characterized. Attempts to detect polyomaviruses in a variety of tumor types have consistently found that HPyV7 is either absent or present at very low viral loads, indicating that it is unlikely to be causally related to the tumor. HPyV7 has been associated in case reports with a skin condition in immunocompromised patients—HPyV7-related epithelial hyperplasia—specifically lung transplant recipients on a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. The reported skin manifestations consisted of severely pruritic (itchy) velvet- textured plaques initially interpreted clinically as drug side effects. Histological findings include viral particles contained in eosinophilic keratinocytes. Evidence of actively replicating HPyV7 was identified in affected tissue, supporting the hypothesis that the virus caused the rash.

History =Ancient times= Mechanisms for dealing with risk in Iraq can be traced to the ancient Babylonians and the Code of Hammurabi. This established a system of bottomry (whereby the ship master would take a loan and then use the ship itself as collateral against it) and is seen as an early form of merchant and marine insurance dating back to around 1772 BCE. =Insurance under Ottoman laws= Two pieces of legislation are noteworthy during this period, firstly the Ottoman Commercial Law (9 August 1904), followed by the supplementary Ottoman Insurance Companies Act (1905). Despite these, there is no evidence to suggest commercial, institutional insurance activity was known in Iraq until at least after the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of October 1922.Basim A Faris, Insurance &Reinsurance; in the Arab World (London: Kluwer Publishing, 1983), p43. Indeed, by 1928 only 3 insurance companies were known to be operating in Iraq, under the Ottoman laws,Hanna Batatu, The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq, (London, al-Saqi Books, 2000) one of which was the General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation (now Aviva Insurance Ltd.). =Foreign agencies and the birth of modern insurance in Iraq (1936-1964)= The Insurance Companies Act was brought into effect on 1 April 1936. It was the first Iraqi law passed to specifically regulate the industry. Egypt's Al-Chark Insurance Company (part of Misr Insurance since 2007\\"Misr Holding : Company Profile\\" (PDF). Misrholding.co) was the first to set up an agency in Transjordan towards the end of the 1940s and was one of the first in Iraq under the 1936 law, where Edward Fram acted as their first representative. Other insurance pioneers at this time included Shafiq Ades and Andrew Weir, 1st Baron InverforthMisbah Kamal. \\"Insurance Agencies in Iraq 1936\\". Academia.edu =Nationalisation of the industry (1964)= In 1960, the introduction of the Insurance Firms and Agents Law No. 49 replaced the aforementioned law of 1936. By the time of the nationalisation of the industry in 1964, there were still just 15 branches and agencies of regional (Arab) and foreign insurance companies across Iraq. These included the following: *l Ittihad Al Watani (L’ Union Nationale), General Insurance Co for the Near East, S.A.L. *2 Compagnie Libanaise d’Assurance *3 Al-Chark Insurance Company *4 Misr Insurance Company *5 Arabia Insurance Company *6 Royal Insurance Company *7 Atlas Insurance Company *8 London Provincial Marine & General Insurance Company *9 Sun Insurance Office *10 Guardian Assurance Company *11 Société l'Union des Assurances de Paris *12 Provincial Assurance *13 American Life Insurance Company *14 New India Insurance Company *15 National Insurance Company of New Zealand In 1966, two years after the nationalisation was completed, Clement Shammas was appointed by Iraq's then Prime Minister Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz as the head of the newly formed Iraqi Insurance Organisation (abolished in 1988). Under the Baath Party in 1997, Law No. 49 (1960) was itself repealed handing the Iraqi Ministry of Finance the authority to oversee all insurance and reinsurance activities in Iraq. At this time, private insurance companies were also allowed to form and the first such company, Dar Al-Salam Insurance Co, was established in 2000 http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/1000008676.pdf Present day market =Post-Baathist insurance (2003 - present)= The current legislation is the Insurance Business Regulation Law (2005) drafted under the guidance of USAID/BearingPoint Inc.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdaca883.pdf It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the size of the current industry in Iraq, but using gross written premiums as a guide, the 2013 figure was in the region of $300–480million (with $240–400 million from state-owned companies and $60–80 million from privately owned ones).

After her doctorate, Horowitz went to the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) from 1977–8 as an Andrew Mellon postdoctoral fellow, before teaching variously at Vassar College (instructor/assistant professor of philosophy 1974–78), New York University (assistant professor of philosophy, 1978–83) and Purchase State College, State University of New York (visiting assistant professor of philosophy, 1983-4). She returned to Pittsburgh in 1985 as a visiting assistant professor; that same year, she published \\"A Priori Truth\\" in The Journal of Philosophy, an article which was included in volume VIII of the Philosopher's Annual as one of the year's best philosophy papers. She became an assistant professor on the faculty at Pitt the following year. She coedited (with Gerald J. Massey) a collection of 21 papers arising from a conference at Pitt on the philosophy of science; this was published with Rowman & Littlefield as Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy in 1991.Carrier, Martin (1993). \\"Tamara Horowitz & Gerald J. Massey (eds.), Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy\\". Erkenntnis 39 (3): 413–9. She was promoted to associate professor in philosophy and associate professor in women's studies in 1993, as well as being named the associate director of the university's Center for the Philosophy of Science. Some years later, Horowitz was appointed chair of the Pitt philosophy department, and took up the role on September 1, 1999. However, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor later that month. She died January 30, 2000, at her home in Shadyside, Pittsburgh. She was married to the philosopher Joseph Camp, and had two stepsons, John and David Camp. A lecture in memory of Horowitz by Alexander Nehamas—\\"The place of beauty and the role of value in the world of art\\"—was published in Critical Quarterly in 2000. Colin MacCabe described Horowitz in an editorial for the issue as someone who > had no time whatsoever for the pompous or the pretentious; her concern was > always with argument and debate, with the elaboration of human knowledge. > ... [She was] a logician of the first rank who was also committed to a > project of social emancipation. He explained how Horowitz situated her work in the tradition of logical positivism, and intended to return to work on the socialist legacy of the Vienna Circle once her work on belief paradoxes, upon which she had focused later in her life, was complete. A book of Horowitz's work, The Epistemology of A Priori Knowledge, was published in 2006. It was edited by Joseph Camp.Gregory, Dominic (2008). \\"The Epistemology of A Priori Knowledge – by Tamara Horowitz\\". Philosophical Books 49 (2): 167–8. Selected bibliography Much of Horowitz's work was concerned with either the epistemology of a priori knowledge or with feminist philosophy.

The Royal Navy captured her in May 1797 and took her into service under her existing name. In British service she served primarily on the North Sea station where she captured three small French privateers, and many Dutch merchant vessels. She also participated with other British warships in two or three major cutting-out expeditions. She was broken up in 1807. French service Between 24 March 1794 and 25 August, Jalouse was at Le Havre and Ostend, and under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Astague.Fonds Marine, p.98. On 5 October 1795 lieutenant de vaiseau Pierre- Édouard Plucket took command of Jalouse. At the time she was apparently armed with 12 guns, and had a crew of 150 men. Under his command, Jalouse in a 15-day cruise in 1795 captured seven prizes and 52 men. From 7 March 1797 until her capture, French official records confirm that Jalouse was under Plucket's command, and based at Flessingue. From there she cruised the North Sea, and arrived at Bergen.Fonds Marine, p.186. Sailing from Bergen, she captured three prizes, including a whaler of eight guns and 42 men. He also burnt three vessels under the guns of a fort at Berwick. On 27 March, or 7 April (records differ), Jalouse encountered the sloop in the North Sea. An inconclusive 11-hour engagement ensued. Afterwards Plucket reported that he had engaged a 38-gun frigate; according to a French account, Captain James Wallis of Tisiphone reported that he had engaged a 28-gun frigate. Supposedly, when Plucket's English prisoners from prizes returned to Britain and reported that Jalouse was a 12-gun brig, Wallis was court-martialed and reduced in rank. There seems to be only passing mention of the engagement in one English- language source that makes no mention of a court martial and that identifies Tisiphones opponent as the privateer Naïade.The British may have confused Jalouse with Naïade which was a naval vessel operating out of Flessingue and in the North Sea at the same time. If so, it is not clear why Wallis would have referred to her as having 28 guns; Naïade was of the same force (armament) as Jalouse. (Note: there is no record of a contemporary privateer Naïade.) After the engagement with Tisiphone, Jalouse returned to Bergen. There she replenished her store of munitions, recruited 20 Dutch sailors to rebuild his crew, and then set out for Flessingue. On the way she captured two more British vessels. Capture , under the command of Captain Charles White, captured Jalouse at about 5a.m. on 13 May 1797 near Elsinor after a chase of about nine hours and running about 84 hours. For an hour and a half during the chase Jalouse fired her stern chasers, two long 12-pounder guns. White was able to bring Vestal alongside Jalouse and fired three broadsides before she struck, having suffered great damage to her masts and rigging. At the time of capture, Jalouse had 16 guns, though she was pierced for 20, and had shifted some guns to the vacant ports. Her armament consisted of twelve \\"very long 12-pounders\\", and four 6-pounder guns. Her commander, \\"C. Plucket\\", had a crew of 153 men, two of whom were killed and five of whom were wounded. Vestal suffered no casualties. Vestal brought Jalouse into the Humber. The British took their French prisoners back to England. Plucket managed to escape and return to France. The court martial for the loss of Jalouse then acquitted him. British service Jalouse underwent fitting out at Deptford between 24 July and 16 October 1797. Commander John Temple commissioned Jalouse in September 1797 for the North Sea. Jalouses first documented capture was the merchant vessel Gerrit Hendrick Groote, which Jalouse captured on 7 May 1798. Later that month, on 25 May, Jalouse captured Mercurius, which was condemned as droit of Admiralty. In June and July Jalouse captured Zeelust, Antonella, Anna, and Surprize. On 22 February 1799 Jalouse captured Hermina. The next dayJalouse was off the Texel when she captured the French privateer brig Jason. Jason, of Dunkirk, was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 52 men. Lieutenant Dawes, of the hired armed cutter Phoenix arrived at Yarmouth Roads on 9 March with intelligence from the Haak Sands at the mouth of the Texel. He reported that he had observed 20 enemy vessels moored as they had been all winter. He further reported that Jalouse was always on site, so that Temple would readily observe any enemy activity. Dawes also brought with him a letter from Temple stating that prisoners from Jason had reported that 15,000 troops in France were to march to Holland to be embarked on transports.Castlereagh and Vane (1848), Vol. 2, pp.198-9. Jalouse was in company on 10 April with the hired armed cutters Nancy and Phoenix. They shared the proceeds of the capture of the brig Maria. Two days later Jalouse and Nancy captured Unvernkorff. Two days after that, Jalouse and Nancy recaptured Friendship. Jalouse and recaptured the cutter Rover on 10 May. On 4 June and Jalouse recaptured the sloop Ceres. Jalouse recaptured both off the coast of Norway and sent them into Yarmouth. Rover had been sailing from Riga to Hull when captured, and Ceres, of Berwick, had been sailing from Leith to London. During the night of 27 June Temple and Captain James Boorder of volunteered to cut out some Dutch gunboats lying at the back of the island of Ameland, so Capt. Winthrop of Circe ordered , Jalouse, Espiegle, and to join him in anchoring as close to the shore as possible in order to assist them. When the British boats arrived, they found that their targets were pulled up on shore where the cutting out party could not reach them. The British instead took out 12 merchant vessels, six with cargoes and six in ballast, and retreated. There were no British casualties, even though Dutch shore batteries fired on the attackers. A later prize money notice identified some of the Dutch vessels as Twee Gebroders (Dirks, master), Twee Gebroders (Jansen, master), Jonge Evert, Vrow Regina, Anna Elizabeth, Vrow Trentje, and four fishing vessels. Then on 10 July Jalouse was a part of a small squadron consisting also of Espiegle, Courier, Pylades, and the hired armed cutter Nancy, all under Winthrop's command in Circe. The boats of the squadron rowed for 15 or 16 hours into the Watt at the back of Ameland. There they captured three merchant vessels carrying sugar, wine and brandy, and destroyed a galliot loaded with ordnance and stores. On 24 November 1799 Admiral Lord Duncan sent Jalouse find a privateer that had been operating off the coast. Jalouse encountered the privateer on the 29th. and she struck after a chase of 5 hours. She was a brand new, copper-bottomed lugger called Fantasie, of 14 guns and 60 men. Temple was able to rescue the four masters and 35 seamen of four laden colliers that the privateer had taken the previous day close in to Flamborough Head. He then went off towards Ostend in pursuit of the prizes and on the 30th he retook Sally. of Lynn.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.226. Jalouse brought Fantasie into Harwich.Lloyd's List, n° 4017. Accessed 15 August 2016. On Saturday 5 April 1800 Jalouse took the small French privateer cutter Inattendu. She was armed with two guns and small arms, and had a crew of 25 men. She had captured nothing since leaving Ostend the previous Wednesday. A month later, on 4 and 5 May, Jalouse was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutters Fox, and Marechal de Cobourg, and , though most were much larger and included , , , , , among others. Also on 5 May, Jalouse captured Johanna Eleonora, Malmberg, master, and Luste en Friede, Straud, master. On 13 May Jalouse captured Vrouw Etje, De Haan, Augustina, and De Brock. In 1801 the Honorable Frederick Paul Irby took command of Jalouse, then operating in the North Sea. Jalouse, under Irby's command, recaptured the sloop Friends, of Airth on 3 February. Four days later Jalouse recaptured the brig Providence, of Sunderland. The privateer Victoire had captured Providence and Jalouse had to cut Providence out of Norway.Lloyd's List, n° 4127. Accessed 15 August 2016. Jalouse, while under his command, was instrumental in saving when she was driven ashore on the coast of Holland. Irby's youngest brother, Charles Leonard Irby, was a midshipman on board Narcissus, having joined her on 23 May.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.1. Jalouse and Marshal de Cobourg, together or singly, captured several Dutch vessels between 22 and 24 July: :Negotie and Zeeward (22 July; Jaloufe and Marshal de Cobourg) :Hoop (same) :Jusfrouw Dirkje (23 July; Jalouse and Marshal de Cobourg) :Hoffnung (24 July; Jalouse) :Fortuna (Jaloufe) On 31 July Jalouse and captured Brockmerlust, with the capture of Neptunus following on 1 August. The next day Jalouse and Lynx captured Vrow Caterine. , Lynx, and captured three ships on 6 September: Snelle, Jager, and Engesende. Jalouse shared in the proceeds by agreement with Lynx and Driver. On 26 September Jalouse captured the dogger Fortuna. Squirrel, Driver, , and Jalouse shared in the proceeds of the capture on 5 October of Carolina Wilhelmina. Jalouse also captured smugglers. On 25 March 1802 she seized a \\"Tub Boat and Quantity of Spirits\\". Irby received promotion to post captain on 14 April 1802. Commander Christopher Strachey then replaced him on the 29th. Jalouse continued to operate off Calais. On 19 May 1803 Jalouse, under Strachey's command, captured Jong Jan Pieter. Jalouse shared the prize money with and the gun-brigs and , with whom she had been in company. Lloyd's List reported that Grampus and Jalouse had sent into the Downs a large Dutch ship from Surinam bound for Rotterdam.Lloyd's List, n° 4352. Accessed 15 August 2016. That same day Jalouse also captured Deux Freres. Two days later Jalouse captured Speculation. The frigate , together with Jalouse and , captured two French gun-vessels, the schooner Inabordable and the brig Commode on 14 June 1803 after the French vessels had run themselves ashore under the protection of the guns of a shore battery at Cap Blanc Nez near Sangatte. After about an hour's firing by the British warships, and the French batteries and gun-vessels, the boats of the three British ships were able to take possession and refloat the two gun-vessels. Each of the French gun-vessels was armed with three 24-pounder guns and one 8-pounder gun. The only casualty was one man from Jalouse, who was badly wounded. Later reports described the two French vessels as gun-brigs, and gave their names as Inabordable and Mechanté. The Royal Navy did not take either into service. Lucius Curtis received promotion to commander on 16 November 1804, and assumed command of Jalouse, then in the Mediterranean Fleet, later that month. A convoy from Smyrna arrived at Malta on 2 January 1805, and the convoy left for England on 4 January. Jalouse had escorted the convoy from Smyrna and she continued on as an escort as far as western Sicily.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, pp.278-306. In June 1805 Curtis commissioned at Portsmouth.Unfortunately, readily available records do not reveal who commanded Jalouse between Curtis's departure and her return to Britain to be paid off. In an enclosure to a letter dated 7 October 1805, Admiral Lord Nelson wrote, \\"Jalouse, Childers, and Merlin being unfit for the service of this Country, are ordered home with the first Convoy to be repaired\\". Fate Merlin and Childers went on to serve for some more time. However, Jalouse was paid off in May 1806. She was then broken up at Woolwich in March 1807.

Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.

It was held in Dakar, Senegal between 9 and 12 July 1987. The conference discussed topics such as strategies for bringing fundamental change in South Africa, national unity, structures of the government and the future of the economy in a free South Africa. The IDASA delegation from South Africa, participated in the conference in their private capacity and would later be condemned by the South African government for meeting a banned organization. The future indirect result of the conference was South African government talks with Nelson Mandela and his eventual meeting with P. W. Botha in 1989.  Background  Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, a member of the opposition resigned from the Progressive Federal Party and the South African parliament in January 1986, describing it as irrelevant and that he would explore other avenues of negotiations between white and black South African's. Dr. Alex Boraine would also leave with him. Van Zyl Slabbert and Boraine would the establish The Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA), a non-partisan organization that aimed to promote inclusive democracy in South Africa by talking to people of all races within and outside the country. Slabbert, in communication with Thabo Mbeki, member of the ANC National Executive, discussed the change in attitude amongst some of the Afrikaner elite towards Afrikaner Nationalism and Apartheid. Out of these discussions and meetings, an idea was generated for a possible meeting between them and the ANC. This would be a change from the opposition White liberals attempting to force political change from within the parliamentary system, to the Afrikaner elite taking direct action in shaping the future direction of South Africa. Later in 1986, Slabbert and Breyten Breytenbach met on Gorée Island of Dakar in Senegal and decided that the city should be the location of the conference. The two then approached George Soros to help finance the conference, which he would do, but he was skeptical that the conference would achieve anything for South Africa. Breytenbach then approached Danielle Mitterrand, the French president's wife who headed the France-Libertés Foundation and who was well acquainted with Abdou Diouf, the Senegalese President, and asked her to intercede with him to allow the South African delegates to enter Senegal and ensure the security of the conference. The African Jurists' Association would also play a role in the conference's organisation. By 3 June 1987, more than a month before the start date, the South African press had caught wind of the proposed conference and published stories about a group of South Africans who were going to have a meeting with the ANC. The IDASA delegation personally invited by Slabbert consisted of 61 delegates with at least half consisting of Afrikaner academics, teachers, journalists, artists, directors, writers and professionals and the group had Afrikaans speaking Coloureds, ten English-speaking businessmen and academics and three South African based German academics. The South African delegation attended in their private capacity and did not represent the organisations they worked for. The seventeen ANC delegates would be led by Thabo Mbeki in his capacity of ANC Director of Information and four other members of the ANCs National Executive Committee while the other twelve were made up of ANC members based in Zambia, Scandinavia, UK, Ireland, United States and West Africa. The IDASA delegation flew into Dakar from London and were met at the airport by the Senegalese Head of Protocol in the VIP lounge and then escorted by motorcycle riders to their hotel where the conference would take place and were met there by the ANC delegation. During the conference, the delegates would attend receptions at Presidential Palace and the Minister of Educations residence. The conference began on 9 July and would end on 12 July.  Conference  The conference was opened by President Abdou Diouf and attended by his cabinet and members of the diplomatic community and then an address was given by Danielle Mitterrand. The delegates would then return to their hotel and the conference venue. Four major topics had been agreed upon and the delegates had submitted the papers prior to conference and had been viewed by the ANC and they would respond to them after their presentation. The four major topics included, strategies for bringing fundamental change in South Africa, national unity, structures of the government and the future of the economy in a free South Africa. Informal topics were also discussed and included the armed struggle, violence, negotiations, political pluralism, a Bill of Rights, future of Afrikaans and its culture, a future economy, distributive justice and other topics. The delegates in their presentation expressed their concern about violence in South Africa and its impact on civilians while the ANC members outlined why they had begun an armed struggle when all other peaceful strategies to bring about racial policy change in South Africa had failed and that attacks on soft targets was not a policy and that control over its armed cadres in the country was not always possible. It was clear to the delegates during the discussions that the ANC was prepared to negotiate with the government but that certain preconditions would have to be met which included the release of political prisoners and the unbanning of banned organisation's in the country. With regards to pluralism, the ANC expressed a commitment of political pluralism in a new South African political system and that racism and fascism would be outlawed in the political system. It expressed a belief that the groups committed to the ending of Apartheid would in a new South Africa political system would split into its own organizations expressing their own ideas and beliefs. The ANC in the discussion concerning a Bill of Rights said it did not have a problem with it but would not guarantee privileges in such a bill. It expressed a reassurance that the Afrikaans language would be safeguarded as well as its cultural identity and that all people's cultural heritages should be protected. Concerning the future South African economy the ANC's policies were still governed by the Freedom Charter and that some form of nationalization would be required to redress the economic and wealth imbalances and that any nationalization would not occur instantly and consultation would take place between business and the future government. Health housing and education were key areas that the ANC would be readdressing. At the conclusion of the conference, a declaration was released by the participants stating that a negotiated settlement in South Africa was preferred and that main obstacle was the South African government's unwillingness to negotiate, and the delegates concern about the level of uncontrolled violence in the country. A ferry trip was then organized to the Gorée Island and they visited the Maison des Esclaves and its museum in remembrance to the Dutch slave trade in West Africa.

Forty South African delegates would return on 21 July 1987 and were met at the airport by a hundred demonstrators from the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) led by Eugene Terre Blanche. Posters would accuse the delegates of being traitors, communists and terrorists. No news conference was held by the delegates, having been banned by the police and they were escorted via a back entrance from Jan Smuts International Airport. Frederick Van Zyl Slabbert and Dr. Alex Boraine would return to South Africa on 31 July. The ruling National Party condemned the talk, worried about the legitimacy the conference gave to the ANC and the government controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and Afrikaner newspapers were critical. English newspapers were said to be critical and lukewarm to the conference. Government officials would express their opinion privately that they thought the conference would hinder the government's own initiates. In the end, the conference had broken the ice and would make it acceptable for an Afrikaner government to negotiate in the future with the ANC as well as the ANC to understand the Afrikaner. Further meetings were held when South African businessmen met with the ANC, Stellenbosch University students would meet in Lusaka and IDASA would organize further meetings in Germany, United States, France, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The player- character docks with the ship, and discovers that while the Nautilus is still functional, it has fallen into disrepair, with no sign of its human crew. The only conversations on the ship are through the ship's artificial intelligence (AI) named Kaizen-85 (from the Japanese word kaizen meaning \\"continuous improvement\\"), who communicates with the player-character through keyboard terminals throughout the ship. Kaizen-85 instructs the player-character to destroy the Nautiluss \\"Singularity Drive\\", the engine that powers the ship, as it claims this will enable it to return them both back to Earth. However, as the player explores the station more, they discover that many of the doors and systems have been locked down apparently by the previous human crew, and must work with Kaizen-85 to access these systems. The player communicates with the AI by physically typing input instead of selecting from a set of inputs. The AI is capable of procedurally generating over two million lines of dialog, with personality influenced by the player's input. The player must gather clues as to discover what happened on the ship and eventually finds out that Captain of the Nautilus, Anele Johnson, murdered one of the crew so as not to allow Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. When the player recovers the code to the bridge terminal and enters it, they can find Anele Johnson's body in one of the seats, who was presumably killed after uploading her consciousness into the Nautilus's mainframe. Depending on the player's choices and their attitude previously to Kaizen, multiple endings can occur. = Lore = The game takes place on the Nautilus, a luxury tourist ship owned by the ITS corporation (International Transport Spacelines). The Nautilus is equipped with an AI named Kaizen-85. =Endings= The first ending is achieved when the player allows Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. The player will then engage in a conversation with Anele Johnson's consciousness via computer; she is angry at the player and explains that in order to save humanity, the player must upload his/her consciousness into the computer so as to overpower Kaizen. If the player agrees to this, the player-character is killed and their consciousness uploaded into the computer. Within the computer system, they are told by Anele's consciousness that Kurt, the President of ITS, convinced Kaizen to lie about the Singularity Drive. She also explains that destroying the Drive will mean that humans will never develop advanced colonies. After going through all the doors, Anele asks the player if they want to go home and the final door will open and Earth can be seen in the distance before the credits roll. The second ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness. If the player has mistreated Kaizen, he will reply that he is \\"too old for this\\" and will delete his memory from the Nautiluss mainframe and hand over control to the player. A cutscene will play out showing the current state of each room the player previously explored before the credits roll. The third ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness but treated Kaizen kindly enough, he will remember events during their time speaking before he launches the emergency boosters and tells the player: \\"Let's go home.\\" A cutscene will play with the Nautilus steadily moving towards the Earth before the credits roll. Although the game has three endings, a fourth ending can be achieved if the player refuses to destroy the Singularity Drive, refuses to upload their consciousness, and has treated Kaizen kindly throughout the game. After questioning the player's trust, Kaizen can be convinced to send the Nautilus to Earth even though the player didn't destroy the drive. The same cutscene as the third ending will play before the credits. The fourth ending is actually due to a bug in the game and was labeled as a \\"secret ending\\". Development Event[0] began as part of a graduate student project at the National School of Video Game and Interactive Media in France (Enjmin) in 2013. The students later formed Ocelot Society in order to continue development into a commercial project. The team that worked on Event[0] is composed of eleven people. In 2014, the game received the student award at the European Indie Game Days as well as the Innovation award at BIG 2015. Event[0] received funding from France's CNC, as well as from the Indie Fund. The game, as released, had three expected endings, with Ocelot Society having dropped a possible fourth ending prior to release. However, around July 2017, Emmanuel Corno, one of the developers and writers at Ocelot, noted that the Wikipedia page for the game had described a different fourth ending to the game (the last one listed above) which he affirmed was possible to obtain in the released game, and was not the same as the dropped ending. Corno attributed this unexpected ending to be the result of a bug that the team had not caught until this point, but was pleased that it existed as it made the artificial intelligence they created feel \\"more human\\". Reception Event[0] has received positive reviews and has a score of 78 on Metacritic. Reviewers have compared Event[0] to games such as the solitary narrative of Firewatch, as well as the King's Quest series. The environment has been compared to the spaceship in Ridley Scott's Alien. Several reviewers have also noted the similarities between Event[0]'s Kaizen AI and HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey. A common complaint even among positive reviews is the game's very short play time: as little as 3 hours for the first playthrough and an hour for subsequent playthroughs for the other endings. Event[0] was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and for the Excellence in Design and Excellence in Narrative awards for the 2017 Independent Games Festival. A scholarly article indicated Event[0]'s references to philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, as well as to the game's links to the posthuman turn in philosophy. The author of the article notes that the game reflects a change in the way artificial intelligence is portrayed in video games; AI in Event[0] does not have to become an enemy as it had been common in video games, but can develop into an equal partner depending on the player's actions.

It was built in 1936 by Jack Schloss. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 September 1993.  History  This timber hall was completed in 1936 at Boonarga, a small settlement approximately southeast of Chinchilla. The hall was erected as a monument to the cactoblastis moth which overcame prickly pear in Queensland and New South Wales during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Cactoblastic moth Cactoblastis larvae feeding on the prickly pear The appearance of prickly pear in Queensland has been attributed to a small number of prickly pear plants brought to Queensland as garden plants. By 1862 prickly pear was growing in the Chinchilla district and spread rapidly in areas where land holdings were extensive and population relatively low. Prickly pear was declared a noxious weed in Queensland in 1893. By 1900 approximately were affected by prickly pear; an area which had extended to an estimated by 1920. About half of this area was so densely covered by prickly pear that the land was useless for production. The costs of mechanical and chemical methods of eradication exceeded the value of the land and therefore did not prove economically viable for controlling the spread of prickly pear. In 1912 the Queensland government established an experimental station in the heart of prickly pear country at Dulacca under the direction of a full-time scientist. The biologist chosen to establish and run this experimental station was Dr. Jean White-Haney. These investigations were regarded as \\"a great experiment in scientific research\\"; an experiment which was considered almost unique at this time. The progress of these investigations was followed by the international scientific community. In 1925, 3000 cactoblastis eggs were imported from South America. These eggs were divided between the Sherwood laboratory, and the Chinchilla Field Station which had been established in 1923 as one of four Queensland field stations responsible for rearing and distributing insect supplies. The first prickly pear plant was destroyed by the cactoblastis moth at Chinchilla in September 1926. The last extensive area of prickly pear in Queensland was destroyed in 1933, and the Chinchilla Field Station was closed at the end of 1936. The Chinchilla district was one of many areas which experienced renewed prosperity as land cleared of prickly pear was utilised for agriculture and dairying pursuits. Proposals to erect a hall at Boonarga were first discussed in July 1934, at which time a public meeting was held and a Hall Committee appointed. Land for the proposed hall was donated by Mrs Fahey, a resident of Boonarga. In October 1934 the Committee decided to name the hall the Boonarga Cactoblastis Memorial Hall in honour of the cactoblastis moth. Finance for the hall was arranged through the Bank of New South Wales in Chinchilla with a number of Boonarga residents acting as guarantors. Tenders for the erection of the hall were called by the Committee in June 1935. Although a tender was recommended for acceptance, tenders were reinvited in July 1935. The hall was built by local builder Mr Jack Schloss, at a cost of and opened in February 1936 by Godfrey Morgan, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. A gala ball was held to mark the occasion. Alterations to the hall in 1963 included the addition of the second aisle on the southeastern side of the hall. A new dance floor was laid . The hall is presently used as a venue for dances, meetings and other functions.  Description  A single-storeyed timber building set on low timber stumps with a pitched galvanised corrugated iron roof the Cactoblastis Hall is situated on the southwestern side of the Warrego Highway southeast of Chinchilla. Set back about from the highway the building, approximately square in plan, consists of a central dance room with adjoining aisles on the southeastern and northwestern sides. The dance room has a simple gable roof which changes pitch to form shallower skillion roofs over the aisles. The building is clad in weatherboards and has timber doors and a variety of windows, the originals being double hung sashes. Most of the more recent openings are fitted with glass or metal louvres. On the rear elevation is a junction in the weatherboards indicating the later addition of the southeastern aisle. Windows and possibly some of the weatherboards from the earlier southeastern wall have been reused in the addition. The main entry doors, located in the centre of the front facade, are protected by a timber-framed gable-roofed porch with a weatherboard balustrade. A ramp has been added to the southeastern side of the porch. Above the doors, below the ridge of the roof, is hung a large sign bearing the name of the town, the hall and the date of construction which replaced the original sign. A sign to the east of these doors acknowledges the hall as a venue for meetings of the Queensland Country Women's Association. Double hung sash windows flank these timber panelled double doors. On the northwestern side of the front facade double timber doors under a slender steel framed flat roofed porch have replaced a double hung sash window. Timber doors are also located on the side and rear facades. The central space has an unlined roof, a timber dance floor, recently renewed, and a stage which is located at the southwestern end. A steel truss has replaced the original partition walls and swing doors between the dance room and the northwestern aisle. A large opening between the supper room in the southeastern aisle and the dance room is infilled with lattice. The ticket office is located in the northern corner, a kitchen in the eastern corner and toilets in the western corner of the building.  Heritage listing  Cactoblastis Memorial Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 September 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As a hall erected to commemorate a significant scientific and economic event (the successful control of prickly pear by the cactoblastis moth), the Cactoblastis Memorial Hall at Boonarga is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage as the only known building dedicated to an insect. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of a timber hall built to service a small rural community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a hall in continuous use since 1936, the place has a strong and special association with the Boonarga community.

It was designed by Alfred Gray and built in the 1950s (nursery buildings) by Harry Howe. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  Myall Park Botanic Garden is a large garden devoted to the growing of Australian flora. It was established in 1941 by David Gordon (1899-2001). David (Dave) Morrice Gordon (AM) was born 9 July 1899, the fifth of nine children for James and Agnes Gordon. In 1910 the Gordon family moved to the Western Downs region from Talbot, in the Central Goldfields region of Victoria. The Gordons took up a \\"prickly pear selection\\" known as \\"The Lagoons\\" (later Lesmoir) on the Balonne River, as part of a group settlement. The rapid infestation of the prickly pear cactus, Opuntia stricta, led to abandoned properties and surrendered large pastoral leases in affected areas of Queensland. In response, the Queensland Government introduced prickly pear selections, where land either infested or partly affected was offered for lease at good terms. Group Settlement Schemes, where three or more parties selected in the same parish, were promoted as part of this process. By the beginning of 1909, had been taken up as prickly pear selections, the majority being in the Dalby Land Agent's district, where the Gordons settled.Mackenzie, pp. 8, 12-16Brisbane Courier, 20 February 1909, p.5 The planting of Australian flora in gardens and house settings began early in Queensland and other Australian colonies, but it was not until the latter decades of the 20th century, that their popularity became widespread and gardens devoted to Australian flora became common. From the middle of the nineteenth century, large tall trees from the Araucaria family such as the bunya and hoop pines, and fig trees were widely planted, or in some instances, retained on properties after clearing. Ferns and palms suitable for indoors or simple ferneries became increasingly popular in the late 1800s. The nationalist sentiment of the Federation era influenced a wider appreciation of Australia's flora and fauna, with native plants and animals appropriated as patriotic symbols in architecture and the decorative arts and crafts. While horticulturalists, botanists and other gardening writers increasingly advocated the use of natives in gardens, most household gardeners preferred to plant out their gardens with plants that reminded them of their largely European origins. For people who were interested, only a small number of nurseries stocked a sufficient range of Australian plants. In the early 1900s Australian flora was more likely to be seen in decorative architectural elements of domestic housing than in gardens.Sim, Jeannie, 2001, \\"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\\" in Whitehead, Georgina (ed) Planting the Nation, Australian Garden History Society, Melbourne, pp.118-119 (pp.115-135)Timms, Peter, Australia's Quarter Acre: The Story of the Ordinary Suburban Garden, Miegunyah, Carlton 2006, pp.172-173Mirmohamadi, Kylie, 2006, \\"Cultivating the Australian Gardener: Native plants and Victorian State School Gardens in the Federation Era\\", in Supski, Sian (ed) ACH: International Journal of Culture and History in Australia , No.24, pp.83-88 (pp.81-98). Though their collections were not always extensive, one type of place where Australian flora could be found was in Queensland's botanic gardens. A network of experimental botanic gardens all initially named Queen's Park, were established throughout Queensland from the mid-1850s. Walter Hill, the first Superintendent of Brisbane's Botanic Garden (now the City Botanic Gardens), played a key guiding role, advising regional botanic gardens, lobbying governments for support and corresponding with like-minded institutions including the Melbourne Botanic Garden and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England. Sustained by annual government grants, local residents were trustees of these early gardens and professional gardeners were employed to develop them. While part of the horticultural purpose of these places was to provide public spaces of ornament and beauty for recreation and education, research and experimentation into the utilitarian qualities of plants were also major functions. Sim, \\"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\\", pp.119-121. From a very early age, Dave Gordon was interested in Australian flora. Nurtured by his father's own interest, by the age of seven he was helping to collect seed and raise native trees in Talbot. At the age of 15, following the death of his father and the enlisting of his brother Jim for military service during World War I Gordon became largely responsible for running \\"The Lagoons\\". In between developing the family property for wool production and completing schooling by correspondence, Gordon further developed his interest in native plants through extensive reading, seed collecting and experimental plantings.Mackenzie, pp. 12-16Crone, Nina, 2002, \\"A Patron of Australian plants: David Morrice Gordon\\", Australian Garden History, Vol.13, No.6, p.22 (pp.22-25)Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \\"David Gordon interview\\", National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, transcript, 1.1.6. In late 1926 the Gordons acquired Myall Park, comprising part of the combined blocks of Cobblegun, Lower Cobblegun and Miggabaroo, that in turn were formerly part of the large Murilla consolidated pastoral run. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Gordon improved Myall Park and acquired more property to increase wool production capacity. In 1940 a pre-existing house on the property was relocated to a ridge just west of Myall Creek and enlarged. Single men's shearing quarters were also built nearby, which were used as temporary accommodation by the Gordon family before the house was completed.Mackenzie, pp. 18-19, 26-27. On pastoral properties producing wool, the provision of accommodation for seasonal workers during the shearing season was a necessity. Shearers' quarters were built to varying standards all over Queensland from the 1840s. The Shearer's and Sugar Worker's Act 1905 was the first Queensland legislation to prescribe minimum standards for \\"proper and sufficient\\" seasonal worker's housing. The Workers' Accommodation Act 1915 and subsequent amendments extended these provisions. Requirements for quarters included a location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, suitable building materials, provision of a verandah, sleeping rooms for workers of a minimum size and height, and separate kitchen, dining room and cook's quarters.See Queensland Government Gazette (QGG), 1915, 30 December No.268QGG, 1905, 14 November No.122QGG, 1921, 17 November No.201. To the south-west of the house, Gordon's long-term vision was to establish a large garden of native plants. The site did not suit grazing purposes and featured aspects desirable for growing the type of arid and semi-arid plants favoured by Gordon. Well-drained, the area was largely unaffected by humidity and frost, had access to water, and featured a range of soil types. While beauty and climatic suitability were important considerations, Gordon also consciously chose particular inland plants for conservation purposes, because of their vulnerability in their natural habitat from land clearing and grazing practices.Mackenzie, pp.18-19, pp.26-27 The prickly pear infestation was successfully controlled across Queensland by 1933 after the introduction of the cactoblastis moth in the mid-1920s. Wool production increased and prices gradually recovered following the worst years of the Depression. Transport links were improved by the extension of the branch of the Western railway line from Dalby to its terminus, the newly surveyed town of Glenmorgan, seven kilometres south-east of Myall Park in 1931. These factors meant by the beginning of the 1940s Gordon could devote more time to establishing his garden. In 1941 the first garden plantings commenced, including needlewood (Hakea leucoptera), scarlet bottlebrush (Callistemon macropunctatus) and silver cassia (Senna artemisiodes) and species of Acacias and Eucalypts.Mackenzie, pp.27-29. Gordon's interest brought him into contact and correspondence with fellow native plant (and wildlife) enthusiasts from across Australia, including botanists, horticulturalists and naturalists. By the early 1940s he was providing specimens and corresponding with the Queensland Herbarium. Another early contact was George Althofer, who with his brother Peter, established Nindethana, one of Australia's earliest commercial nurseries dedicated to native flora at Dripstone, New South Wales. Gordon ordered many of his first plants and seeds from Nindethana and continued to do so over many years until Myall Park became more self-sufficient in the mid-1960s.Aitken, Richard and Looker, Michael, (eds) The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, Oxford University Press, 2002, South Melbourne, p.18Mackenzie, p.29, pp.42-43. While a private garden, the Myall Park Botanic Garden was a serious botanic undertaking from its beginnings. The singular emphasis on collecting and growing native flora was an important step in the evolution of Queensland's botanic gardens. Myall Park was only one of a handful of larger scale gardens with a botanical focus established in the first half of the twentieth century in Queensland. Others were Laurel Park Bank in Toowoomba (1932), originally a private and later council owned garden with a large collection of exotics; Anderson Park in Townsville (1932) a council owned collection of native and exotic tropical flora (mainly trees); and Adele's Grove, Albert Lestang's private experimental botanic garden. Located along Lawn Hill Creek in savannah country southwest of Burketown, by 1939 Lestang had planted over 1000 species of exotic and native plants, shrubs and trees. Lestang corresponded with Dave Gordon and sent him Grevillea and Acacia seeds, before his garden was almost completely destroyed by fire and flooding events in the early 1950s.\\"Adel's Grove & Dave Gordon\\", Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden Newsletter, Winter 2009, p.2\\"Laurel Bank Park\\", viewed 26 June 2012, http://www.toowoombarc.qld.gov.au/\\"Townsville City Council Parks Services\\", http://www.soe-townsville.org/. The 1950s were the key decade of development for Myall Park. Gordon was able to invest more time and money in the garden because of a boom in wool value that saw prices triple between 1947 and 1951.Pearson, Michael and Lennon, Jane, Pastoral Australia: Fortunes Failures and Hard Yakka, 2010, CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, p.155. By this time 26,000 sheep were being shorn annually and Gordon was able to leave much of the responsibility of the property's day-to-day operations with an overseer. A timber residence for the overseer and family (now known as Avochie Cottage) was constructed in the early 1950s, south of the shearer's quarters.Mackenzie, pp.18-19. One hundred and twenty-eight hectares were fenced to prevent livestock from entering the garden. While much of the fenced area was cleared for growing purposes, with the managed garden taking up about , some existing brigalow-belah vegetation was retained, providing a bush setting for the garden. In 1952, Dave Gordon married Dorothy Gemmell. Born in 1930, Dorothy was raised in Glen Aplin in the Granite Belt region, and was from a family of keen naturalists. Sharing her husband's interest in Australian flora, she strongly supported the development of the garden, assisting in numerous garden-related correspondence, preparing Australian flower displays for regional shows and events and acting as a guide and host to many of Myall Park's visitors. Prior to her marriage Dorothy had studied art, and for a period was an art teacher at Fairholme School in Toowoomba. Her immersion in garden-related activities influenced the development of her art, especially the production of botanic watercolours. Her work appeared in The Bulletin, and she was commissioned by government officials to produce art as gifts. Through her involvement in art groups who often visited Myall Park, she drew local attention to the beauty of the garden.Mackenzie, pp.52-55 In 1951, Gordon employed English horticulturalist Len Miller, an assisted migrant soldier who worked as a gardener for Bristol City Council, providing accommodation for him and his wife Ivy in a new timber house, (later called Terpersie) at Myall Park. Miller's first project was to plant out and record 1000 plants that Gordon had accumulated. By this time a makeshift nursery was in operation. Miller also assisted Gordon in collecting plant specimens and seeds. Initially done locally, over 1952-53 Miller travelled to New South Wales and Victoria, collecting and exchanging plants with nurseries and other enthusiasts. In 1954, Len and Ivy Miller decided to leave Myall Park. Gordon offered the Millers a contract to travel to Western Australia to places he had identified for plant collection. Between September 1954 and May 1955, the Millers collected over 700 herbarium specimens, 500 seed species and many cuttings. Collecting both cuttings and seeds meant the garden could grow plants true to their parents and raise seeds that could exhibit diversity. Complementing Gordon's existing specimens and seeds, Len Miller's collection came to comprise a substantial proportion of the Myall Park herbarium.Mackenzie, pp.36-37Crone, pp.22-23Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \\"David Gordon interview\\", 1.2.7. Alfred (Alf) Gray replaced Len Miller, working from 1954 to 1957 at Myall Park. Gordon met Gray in 1951 while visiting nurseries and native plant enthusiasts in Victoria and New South Wales. Gray, a forester, nursery manager, seed collector and propagator, was highly regarded by the time he arrived at Myall Park. As officer-in-charge at the Wail Forest Commission Nursery in Western Victoria (1946–54), Gray had pioneered arid land revegetation through provenance seed harvesting and native plant supply.Aitken, and Looker, (eds), The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, p.272. Gray's work at Myall Park focussed on seed raising, with planting and watering work in the garden the responsibility of Gordon. While Gray was working at Myall Park the infrastructure to support the functions of the garden were improved. Drawing on his prior experience, Gray designed suitable nursery structures. According to Gordon, he built for Gray the types of structures that the Victorian Government would not supply for him at Wail in Victoria.Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \\"David Gordon interview\\", 2.1.6. The nursery consisted of a single-storey timber building with a potting room and a seed storage room, connected by a covered entry to a timber-framed glasshouse/misting room with a concrete slab floor. The timber building was constructed first and the glasshouse was a later addition. A yard to the rear of the buildings housed four large timber hardening bays. The nursery was built by Harry Howe, with the assistance of cabinetmaker Bill Dunmall, who fitted out the vermin proof seed storage room with silky oak cabinet drawers. Cypress pine milled on the property was used in the construction of the buildings. A catalogue system was used to record seed source and date, supplier and usage. Details of propagations, planting locations and survival rates were all recorded. Around this time a large single room, lined with tall cupboards and work benches was constructed at the Gordon family residence house, to provide an art space for Dorothy and to store herbarium specimens. The house is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property, just outside the Botanic Garden boundary.Mackenzie, pp.38-40Crone, p.23Martin, Susan, \\"Visit to Myall Park, Glenmorgan, Queensland\\", Australian Garden History, 2006, Vol.17, No.4, p.19 The herbarium specimens formerly located in the house are now held by the Myall Park Botanic Garden. In 1952 Gordon commissioned the damming of a section of Myall Creek, northeast of the house and garden, to increase water supplies. This was done in 1952 by Joh Bjelke-Petersen (later Premier of Queensland 1968-87), who was working at Myall Park as a contractor clearing vegetation. Over time Gordon filled the artificial lake with native waterlilies from the local area and beyond. Like the Gordon house, the lake is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property. While the garden featured plants that usually received little rainfall in their natural habitats, an irrigation system was installed to assist with acclimatisation after planting out, and to counter any long-term drought conditions. The water system used a network of water tanks on high stands connecting to galvanised piping and hundreds of above ground sprinklers. During particularly dry and hot periods, up to half of the water in the main tank would be used in a day.Mackenzie, p.31, p.41Crone, p.24David Gordon interview, Gregg Borschmann 1993, National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, Final transcript 3.2.2. Gray was also sent on collecting trips by Dave Gordon. During one three-month trip, seeds and detailed growing conditions were collected for more than 1000 species. By the time Gray left Myall Park in 1957, he (like his predecessor Len Miller) had made a major and important contribution to the development of the garden and herbarium. Many of the plants that grow in the garden derive from seeds collected by Gray and Miller. Albert Robinson replaced Alf Gray and worked for ten years in the garden, continuing propagation projects and cultivating existing plants. Bob Doney also worked in the Myall Park garden during the 1960s.Mackenzie, p.39Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \\"David Gordon interview\\", 3.2.1. Gordon's employment of nurserymen for what was, at this time, essentially a private hobby, illustrates his passion and serious investment in the garden. Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' A range of methods were used at Myall Park to provide successful raising and growing conditions, including the preparation of special growing beds, and experiments with soil structure and composition.Mackenzie, pp.42-43. The influence of Gordon's father was evident in the layout of the garden, through the practice of planting in clumps rather than lines. The garden was organised into divisions and Gordon methodically planted as much of a genus as was available together in the garden. Beyond aesthetic and environmental benefits, this planting method was also a way of encouraging natural hybridisation. The genus Grevillea had been a focus during plant collecting trips and in 1963 a new Grevillea hybrid appeared in the garden. Displaying the low growing characteristics of the Grevillea bipinnatifida, together with the vibrant flame coloured flowers of the G. banksii, and the ability to flower throughout the year and attract birds, the hybrid featured highly desirable attributes for gardeners. Gordon named the hybrid Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" after his eldest daughter (who died aged 16 from illness in 1969) and distributed it freely to nurseries in Brisbane and Sydney, without payment. Two other hybrids, named after the Gordon's other daughters, Grevillea \\"Sandra Gordon\\" (also a popular garden plant) and G.'Merinda Gordon' were also produced at Myall Park.Crone, p.23-24Mackenzie p.44, pp.49-50Australian National Botanic Gardens, \\"Gordon, David Morrice (1899-2001)\\", viewed July 2 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/gordon- david.html. With its appealing characteristics and adaptability, Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" became a very popular plant in Australian gardens. It was the first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973. In 1984 the journal Australian Horticulture acknowledged its impact; \\"Market-wise it was a winner. The public readily gave it a place in their gardens. Landscapers looked upon it as 'a gift from above' and it was planted by the tens of thousands\\".Quoted in Crone, p.23Mackenzie, p.50. The Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" is the floral emblem of the Western Downs Regional Council and in 2006 was chosen as the floral emblem for the \\"Year of the Outback\\". The garden was well established by the early 1960s, with plantings maturing and self-sown species proliferating where space was available. The \\"grandiose scale\\" of Gordon's efforts to conserve and grow inland native plants had been acknowledged by the mid-1950s Althofer, George, 1956, The Story of Nindethana ,(booklet, transferred to the web), viewed July 2, 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au /history-horticulture/nindethana/index.html. and visitors became increasingly common at Myall Park. Among the visitors were influential native plant garden advocates Jean \\"Correa\\" Galbraith, Thistle Harris and landscape designer Edna Walling. In addition to visits from specialist interest groups, naturalists, botanists and scientists from institutions like the Queensland Herbarium, experts from other disciplines also conducted research at Myall Park, including world bee authority Dr Charles Michener.Mackenzie p.46. The gardening activities at Myall Park in the post-war decades occurred at a time when the use of native plants in Australian gardens, after decades of advocacy by enthusiasts, became more popular. Increased environmental awareness, availability of native plants in nurseries, architectural fashions for bushland settings for houses and garden designs reflective of natural Australian environments all contributed to this popularity. For some gardeners, this meant accommodating a few natives among a predominance of exotics. For the most fervent, only native plants were considered suitable for their gardens. The Society for Growing Australian Plants (of which David Gordon was a life member) was established in Melbourne in 1957 and rapidly grew to become a national body with state branches. Many other specialized native plant interest groups flourished throughout Australia. The 1970s were a period of inactivity in the Myall Park garden. Dave Gordon was unable to work in the garden following the onset of severe arthritis. The decline in wool prices meant less money could be spent on the garden, and no gardeners were employed during this period. Other than occasional minor maintenance and intermittent irrigation during very dry periods, no planting or nursery work occurred. The inherent climatic resilience of the type of plants in the garden meant that although there were some losses, many survived.Mackenzie, pp.50-51. In the 1980s, Dave Gordon's health improved and he was able once again to spend time in the garden. Nurseryman Reg Carter was employed to operate the nursery and propagate seed cuttings and plants. This renewed activity coincided with the increased recognition of Myall Park as a significant botanic garden in ex-situ conservation of rare and endangered plants. In 1987 Gordon was made a Member of the Order of Australia \\"in recognition of service to horticulture and conservation, particularly in the growing of Australian flora\\". A notable visitor during this period was Professor Grenville Lucas, Keeper of the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, accompanied by staff from the Queensland Herbarium, who acknowledged the unique importance of the collection.Mackenzie pp.61-62 Crone, p.24; Dorothy Gordon's most important body of work was a collection of 48 botanical watercolours of Australian flora. Following her death in a car accident in 1985, a book of this work, Australian Wildflower Paintings, with botanical notes by Dave Gordon was published in 1988, with the assistance of a Bicentennial grant and Meandarra Arts Council. In 1991 the collection was displayed in the Queensland Pavilion at the Osaka Garden Expo. Shortly after the first Myall Park Botanic Garden Open Day in September 1988, Gordon approached friends and family to help determine the future management of the garden. The first meeting of the Myall Park Botanic Garden Committee was held in October, marking a new phase of activity. A \\"Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden\\" association was formed in 1991 to assist with funding and to encourage volunteer work both on and offsite. In 1992, the Committee became an incorporated company limited, with a Board of Directors. In 1994, was excised from the Myall Park pastoral property and granted to Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, to hold the land in trust for Garden purposes.Mackenzie, pp.62-63, 65, pp.74-77 Over five decades the garden evolved from a unique private garden devoted to inland native plants, to an extensive botanic garden with important conservation values. There is no formal accreditation of Australian botanic gardens. The organisation Botanic Gardens Australia and New Zealand Incorporated defines a botanic garden as: \\"...gardens open to the public which grow plants for public enjoyment, scientific, horticultural, conservation or educational purposes, and which have local, national or international roles\\".Information provided by applicant. Between 1970 and 2009, twenty-seven botanical gardens were established or commenced throughout Queensland. While some of these gardens contain a mix of Australian and exotic species, an increasing number concentrate only on Australian flora, and display vegetation from their particular bioregion.Information derived from Smith, Laurie, \\"The Regional Botanic Gardens of Queensland\\", http://www.bganz.org.au/ . Following Australian Government grant funding in 1995, an art gallery designed by Brisbane architect Brian Donovan was opened, housing a permanent display of Dorothy Gordon's original botanical watercolours. Within the grounds of the park the former shearer's quarters and overseer's residence (Avochie Cottage) are used for visitor accommodation.Mackenzie, pp.75-77. Dave Gordon died in 2001 at the age of 102, having made an outstanding contribution to the fields of Australian flora conservation and horticulture. The Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited has been active in preserving Dave Gordon's legacy. Approximately 20 new divisions have been established under their directorship. Onsite caretakers and volunteers from across Queensland play a large role in maintaining the garden, nursery, seedbank and herbarium, and records. Research and other partnerships have been fostered with academic institutions, local government and other community groups. The park has widened its research, education and interpretation activities beyond flora to encompass broader biodiversity values. Over 200 species of birds have been sighted at Myall Park, evidence of its importance as a wildlife refuge. Members of the group Birds Queensland have been longstanding visitors to the garden for bird watching and recording. Myall Park is also a popular venue for artists, photographers, local schools and other interest groups for a range of cultural activities. At the 2009 Open Day, Clocked Out (ensemble-in-residence at Queensland Conservatorium) and the Australian Voices choir collaborated on \\"Grevilleas of Myall Park\\", inspired by the flora of the park. Commissioned artworks are located throughout the garden.  Description  Myall Park Botanic Garden is located approximately north-west of Glenmorgan in the Western Downs region, Queensland. Within its property boundary is a garden landscape of Australian flora of approximately . The site is mostly flat, fenced along its property boundary, and includes a cluster of small timber buildings close to its eastern boundary. The site, formerly part of a large pastoral property is largely surrounded by a rural landscape used for grazing and cropping. Retained local brigalow-belah vegetation provides a bush setting for the botanic garden. The garden comprises thousands of ex situ Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical plants, mostly indigenous to other parts of Queensland and Australia. While the aesthetic of the garden is reflective of an uncultivated inland bush landscape, there is an underlying formality in the layout. The garden is organised into approximately 72 divisions, defined by timber corner pegs. Within the original divisions laid out by David Gordon, plants are grown according to their species, in some instances on raised gravel beds, and are located adjacent to other divisions within their genus. More recent divisions established in the garden generally feature plants from different genera; this occurs in response to soil and climatic variables within the garden or for a particular educational or scientific focus. Soil types within the garden include neutral grey brigalow soil, light loams over clays, red lateritic acid gravel, and a layer of blue/grey clay. Some plantings, including some of the oldest in the eucalypt divisions, may not initially appear their age because of the growing conditions and the particular characteristics of the plants. Plants are often marked with a timber stake with identification tags that include their species and planting date. Reflective of natural growing conditions, established plants receive minimal maintenance. Ground cover, where it exists, is generally not mown in the majority of the grounds, to foster and shelter any unassisted germination. Within the garden, plant labelling and interpretative signage is intentionally unobtrusive. Large water tanks on tall stands are positioned within the garden. Early galvanised steel irrigation pipes are laid throughout the garden and retain sprinkler heads, although these are not in use. A dam for the garden's water purposes is situated on the north-west boundary of the property. A looping gravel drive circulates through the site, entering from the eastern side of the property and broadly follows the edges of the garden, as laid out by David Gordon. A number of dirt walking paths meander through different sections of the garden. The original Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" is located in a grevillea division close to the western edge of the garden. Together with the other Gordon hybrids, it is featured on the \\"Gordon Grevilleas Walk\\". Examples of the parent plants Grevillea bipinnatifida and G. banksii, are planted directly adjacent. Grevillea \\"Sandra Gordon\\" and G. \\"Merinda Gordon\\" are planted nearby, although these are not the original plants. The gallery and toilets (1995) and the old sawmill shed (mostly reconstructed) near the entry of the park are not of cultural heritage significance although they are important components in the current day activities of the garden. A number of artworks (not of cultural heritage significance) are located throughout the garden. Near the eastern edge of the garden, south-east of the gallery is the cluster of buildings comprising Terpersie Cottage (former nurseryman's residence), the nursery, the garage, and the single men's shearers' quarters. To the south of this group is Avochie Cottage. Terpersie Cottage is a small low-set single-storey timber residence. It has a multi-hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a weatherboard exterior. A large brick chimney is on the eastern side and a screened porch is on the north-eastern corner. The building is highly intact, with very little alteration evident. The nursery comprises two single-storey timber-framed buildings connected by a covered entry to form an L-shape around a fenced yard. The long wing accommodates the potting room (slab-on-ground), seed storage room -a timber lined room, and a rear laundry and toilet. The potting room is unlined and includes timber benches clad with metal sheet, timber shelving and early gardening paraphernalia. The concrete floor has spoon drains now partially filled with cement. The seed room contains built-in silky-oak cupboards with many drawers containing seeds collected over a long period of time, most labelled with plant names. Some garden related archival records are also housed in the seed room. The other wing of the nursery accommodates the misting house, a timber framed glasshouse with a concrete slab floor. The lower part of the walls is lined internally with fibre cement sheets. Above this on the side walls are clear glass operable louvres and on the end wall is a large timber-framed pivot window surrounded by fixed clear glass. The roof is clad with overlapping sheets of rippled, fixed glass and near the ridge are clear glass operable louvres. The roof is sheltered externally by a shade cloth mounted on a metal framing. This shade cloth is a later addition, replacing the original louvred panels. The room contains raised timber benches/boxes for plants that incorporate plastic irrigation pipes with misting nozzles. The floor retains spoon drains under the plant benches. The nursery yard retains four hardening bays. These are large timber \\"boxes\\" on legs that have a sheltering frame covered in shade cloth. At the south eastern corner of the nursery yard is a garage. This is a single-storey, slab-on-ground building with a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It comprises three bays with a fourth bay accommodated in a lean-to on the eastern side. The exterior is weatherboards and the interior is unlined. The garage contains approximately 70 plastic tubs that temporarily holds the herbarium collection of Myall Park. The collection consists of thousands of pages of pressed plant specimens mounted on paper. Individual specimens, record collecting locations and dates, and botanical information. To the north-east of the garage is the single men's Shearers' Quarters, an L-shaped single-storey low-set timber building with a chamferboard exterior and a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The long wing accommodates the shearers' bedrooms each with a timber built-in cupboard. The bedrooms are accessed from a long eastern verandah that is enclosed at either end for a bathroom. The short wing accommodates the cook's rooms including a kitchen with a stove recess retaining an early cast-iron stove and early built-in kitchen cupboards. At the junction of the two wings is a dining room with a servery into the kitchen and a large brick fireplace. The chimney breast has an external apron that holds a laundry copper. To the south of this group is Avochie Cottage, a single-storey low-set timber residence with a chamferboard exterior and a multi-gabled roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It accommodates three bedrooms, kitchen, lounge, bathroom, toilet, and a verandah on the southern side. It has two large brick chimneys; the kitchen chimney retains an early cast iron stove.  Heritage listing  Myall Park Botanic Garden was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Myall Park Botanic Garden is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's private and botanic gardens. Established in 1941 by David Gordon, the garden developed from a unique private garden of native plants to an extensive botanic garden with significant conservation and horticultural values. In its earliest decades of development, the garden's scale and singular emphasis on collecting, growing and experimenting with native plants was unparalleled in Queensland. It is thought to be Queensland's oldest garden wholly devoted to Australian flora. As the place where the hybrid Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" first appeared, one of Australia's most popular and widely planted cultivars, the garden is closely associated with the increasing use of native plants in Australian gardens from the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, the parent Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" remains in the garden. Myall Park Botanic Garden has fulfilled many of the traditional functions associated with botanical gardens since the 1940s; increasing horticultural and scientific knowledge about flora, sharing information, seed and plant stock with like-minded institutions, experts and enthusiasts, providing an attractive and educational venue for public recreation (since 1988); and in some instances, providing plant material to nurseries and the public. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Myall Park Botanic Garden's important collection of garden plants, seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, includes ex situ examples of Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical flora rare or threatened in their natural habitats in Queensland and other Australian states. The age and scope of this botanic garden is unique in the history of Queensland's gardens. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Myall Park Botanic Garden's layout, flora, infrastructure, early gardening implements and collection of seeds, herbarium specimens and detailed records have the potential to yield important information related to historical horticultural practices and the conservation and knowledge of Australian flora. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Myall Park Botanic Garden is important in demonstrating both the principal characteristics of botanic gardens in Queensland and significant variations within this place type. The garden's collection of living plants, complemented by the seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, nursery and residence are all important elements shared with other botanic gardens. Contrasting with the more formal design features commonly associated with botanic gardens, it is located within a setting of local vegetation. The layout of the garden is organized into divisional sections without hard edged borders or lawns. Minimal maintenance practices on the plants and garden beds are more reflective of natural growing conditions. The highly intact 1950s purpose- built nursery complex -housing potting and seed storage rooms, glasshouse, hardening bays and early gardening implements, together with the garden's irrigation infrastructure -illustrate the spaces, processes and structures used to establish and maintain the garden. The residence (Terpersie) located adjacent to the nursery demonstrates the provision of accommodation for the garden's nurserymen and their families. The shearer's quarters are a good example of the type of worker's housing provided on pastoral properties following the introduction of workers accommodation legislation in Queensland in the early twentieth century. Highly intact, its principal characteristics include the building's location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, provision of a verandah and separate sleeping rooms for workers, kitchen and cook's quarters, and dining and bath rooms. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Myall Park Botanic Garden is important for its aesthetic significance, exhibiting picturesque qualities. It has distinct integrity as a cultivated landscape of only Australian native plants. It is a living place, constantly evolving, supporting a diversity of flora and fauna, and varying with the seasons. As such, it offers a changing mix of evocative and complex experiences that delight all the senses. The importance of the aesthetic experience of Myall Park Botanic Garden has been demonstrated over many years in its popularity as a tourist destination and its inspiration for artists, writers, photographers, and musicians. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The successful creation of the hybrid Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\", encouraged through a deliberate planting process, was an important technical achievement in the field of Australian floral horticulture in the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, it is now one of Australia's most popular and widely planted native plants. The parent Grevillea \\"Robyn Gordon\\" remains in the garden. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Myall Park Botanic Garden has a special and longstanding association with gardening and Australian flora and fauna enthusiasts and experts. The garden's horticultural and conservation values have been recognised and appreciated since the 1950s. The garden has been a site of inspiration, education and research for naturalists, botanists and scientists and a range of specialist interest groups including the Society for Growing Australian Plants, the Australian Garden History Society and Birds Queensland. Through their involvement as custodians, volunteers and supporters, the Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, the Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden, and the regional community have strong associations with the garden. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Myall Park Botanic Garden has a special association with David and Dorothy Gordon. David Gordon AM (1899-2001) established the garden and was responsible its development for over 50 years. His wife Dorothy Gordon (1930–85) assisted David Gordon in the development of the garden for over 30 years, and promoted Australian flora through her botanical art. The Gordon's played an important role in fostering the appreciation of Australian flora for horticulture and conservation in Queensland and the nation.

The film stars Abbie Cornish, Dermot Mulroney, Justin Long, Diego Klattenhoff, Peyton Kennedy and Lola Flanery. The film was released on DirecTV on February 3, 2017, before being released on VOD and in theaters on March 3, 2017, by Samuel Goldwyn Films. Plot In 1985, police officers tell Patrick that something has happened to his brother and his family. Jane, a blood-covered young teenager, is found by an officer. Lavender Blue plays in the background. Jane is raised by a foster family and has no memory of her family or the tragedy. In 2010, Jane owns a studio, selling photographs she takes of abandoned farmhouses. She has a strained relationship with her husband Alan and their young daughter Alice, partly because she has memory lapses. On one excursion, Jane is mysteriously drawn to the farmhouse from the beginning of the film, taking photos while Alice wanders through the field chatting with an invisible girl. Days later, when Jane is briefly distracted while driving, a girl appears in the road. Jane swerves and her car flips. Jane wakes up in the hospital but doesn't know Alan and Alice. A doctor explains that the crash aggravated a childhood head injury, the reason for her missing childhood. Jane is visited by Liam, the hospital's psychiatrist. Jane receives a mysterious gift, a music-box dancer and a photo from 1985 of the farmhouse she recently photographed. The property records reveal that Jane owns the farmhouse and it has been cared for by Patrick, who is her uncle. Liam suggests that Jane visit the house to try to recover repressed memories. When Jane is released from hospital, the family decides to visit the farmhouse and meet Patrick, who lives at the next farm. Jane finds a red balloon in the fields, with a key on a \\"Welcome Home\\" tag. A clerk at a local antiques store shows Jane a framed front page of a 1985 newspaper, detailing the massacre of her family and the suspicion that Jane was responsible. Jane sees Liam, but he leaves before she can approach him. Jane receives another gift box with a torn family photo featuring young Jane, Susie, and a blurry image of their mother, Jennifer. That night, Jane wakes to see Susie, her young self, and a blurry version of her mother. Susie implores Jane to \\"come find us\\". The next morning Jane visits Patrick, who says that Jane is the only one who knows what happened to her family in 1985. Jane later sees Susie in the barn, who says that they need to hide from \\"the monster\\". At the same time, Alice is telling Alan that the girl has warned her about the monster in the bedroom, while a nice lady has taught her the \\"Lavender\\" song. Jane insists that they leave. They hear Alice scream and she tells them the man was chasing her. She begins to have an asthma attack, and the spirits won't let Jane leave the house when Alan rushes Alice to the hospital. Jane finds a music box in Suzie's room, containing the other half of the torn family photo, revealing Liam to be Jane's father. Susie appears, frightened, when an unseen man enters the room. Jane finally remembers what happened the night her family died: She was babysitting when Susie heard Patrick enter the house. The sisters hid under the bed, but Patrick pulled Susie out and was preparing to molest her when their parents arrive home. (Jennifer, her mother, turns out to be the antiques store clerk Jane saw). Jennifer hears Susie in distress, grabs a hammer, and runs upstairs to find Patrick on Susie. Jennifer confronts Patrick as Susie suffers an asthma attack. Patrick kills Jennifer with the hammer, then chases Jane, who runs into Liam at the top of the stairs. They crash down the stairs, killing Liam and causing Jane’s head injuries. Patrick finds Susie dead of her asthma attack, so he places the hammer in Liam's dead hand and leaves. Jane wakes up and crawls into the corner the police found her in, covered in Liam's blood. Adult Jane sits with Liam, who explains that the family's spirits were trapped and could only lead her to the truth so she could set them free. Jane apologizes and Liam says that they love her. She snaps to reality when Alan comes in. When he tells her that he dropped Alice off at Patrick's, they rush there. They arrive just as Patrick is preparing to molest Alice, and he shoots at Alan. Alan then tries to talk Patrick down but Patrick attempts to shoot at him again just as Jane hits Patrick with a shovel from behind. Patrick wakes up as Jane drags him into Susie's room. As he begs her not to leave him there and insists he made mistakes, she tells him he can plead his case to the family and leaves the house after locking him in. The movie ends with a close- up shot of the photograph that Jane took of her childhood home as Patrick is desperately apologetically crying and screaming for his life.

He was the founder of the highly influential agency, Omar's Men, which had more than a million dollars of revenue its first year of operation (1987), with continued growth thru the mid-90s. It included a roster of male models from The Philippines, Turkey, Brazil, Cambodia, America, etc. He currently owns and runs, JustOmar, a modeling agency and branding company in Southern California. Albertto is known for finding new talents and often credited with originally introducing real people into the U.S. fashion market. In a 1988 LA Times article by Jeanine Stein, he was quoted, \\"I want to have an agency of real people, not models. They are real, everyday people with great style\\". During the last three decades his Men have appeared in almost every prestigious international fashion magazine including; L'Uomo Vogue, GQ, Arena and Esquire - and have appeared in campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Versace, Gucci, Armani and Dolce & Gabbana. Many have also segued into successful acting careers. Thru the years he has introduced (via modeling) the actors Djimon Honsou (Academy Award Nominee), Antonio Sabàto Jr. and Tyrese Gibson - the star of The Fast and the Furious franchise films. His models have worked extensively with photographers such as Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, Matthew Rolston and the late Herb Ritts. Ritts once used Albertto himself to appear in a Gap advertisement that appeared seventy-five feet high above Times Square in New York City. Agent career Omar's first job as a modeling booker began in 1981 with New York's L'image agency where he worked with a young Paul Fisher (present-day star of Remodeled on The CW ). A couple of years later they both moved to California and found work with EastWest Models. Paul represented the girls division and Omar ran the Men's side of the company. After just over a year Paul left the agency to begin his own firm, It Models. In 1987, Omar left as well and founded Omar's Men joining Fisher (and It Models) in an adjoined complex in Hollywood's Photo District. According to the Los Angeles Times, the two agents combined gross revenue was $15,000,000 annually. The men's department soon outgrew itself and Albertto opened an East Coast hub of the company out of Herb Ritt's studio office in Manhattan. Omar has since headed the Men's Divisions of the agencies, Warning Model Management, Q Models, and Talent Rock Entertainment and was briefly president of ITN Fashion TV. On multiple occasions Albertto has cast models in large-scale projects (including Vogue and Dolce & Gabbana) for iconic photographer Mario Testino, who was quoted in Business Wire as saying, \\"Omar's eye is uncanny, he never misses. He never steers me wrong.\\" With his latest incarnation, the agency JustOmar, he is presenting new faces, artists and photographers such as; designer/model Bryant Brown, model Chris Theo, artist/model Connor Tingley, artist/model David Caffrey, architect/model Jose Laguna and Los Angeles photographer, Josie Perez. He has also launched a division specifically for product branding. The Producer In recent years, Omar Albertto has also begun getting more involved in TV and film production. In 2013, he (and Brian Lewis) produced an independent romantic drama film entitled, Things Never Said, for Ohio Street Pictures.

The murders were committed by Ram's daughter Sonia, along with her husband Sanjeev Kumar, on the night of 23 August 2001, over a property dispute. The case was filed and Sonia, Sanjeev and various members of his family were tried. The couple was convicted of the murder charges and sentenced to death by the district court. The sentence was reduced to life imprisonment by the Punjab and Haryana High Court but the death sentence was reinstated by the Supreme Court of India. The couple remained in jail during the process when, under the section 72 (1) of the Constitution of India, a mercy petition was raised. The petition went unanswered by then President Pratibha Patil but was rejected by her successor Pranab Mukherjee. However, the couple's death sentence was reverted to life imprisonment after a petition was filed by the civil rights group People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) citing delays in the disposal of the mercy plea as grounds for clemency, which the Supreme Court accepted in January 2014.  Crime  Relu Ram Poonia (age 50), his second wife Krishna (age 41), his daughter Priyanka (age 16), his son Sunil (age 23), his daughter-in-law Shakuntala (age 20), his grandson Lokesh (age 4), and his two granddaughters Shivani (age 2) and Preeti (age 3 months) were murdered at their farmhouse in Litani on the night of 23 August 2001, while they were asleep. Sonia, Relu Ram and Krishna's daughter, murdered the family by bludgeoning them with a heavy metal rod. The bodies were found in various locations inside the two-storey mansion when a servant arrived in the morning to take Lokesh to his school bus. Shakuntala was gagged, and her hands were tied, while no other signs of resistance by other family members was noted. Sonia consumed insecticide and was found unconscious the next morning and admitted to hospital at Barwala. She had a suicide note that stated that she had killed her father because he did not love her. The previous night, Sonia had brought Priyanka to the farmhouse from a hostel to celebrate her birthday. Firecrackers were set off at midnight and servants mentioned that they saw Sonia come down to the garage and take away an iron rod. Later at around 4.45 a.m IST, Sonia drove away in a Tata Sumo returning in a few minutes. The servants informed police that they suspected that she left to drop off her husband from the crime scene. When police investigated, traces of opium were found in the kheer (rice pudding) that the family had consumed at dinner.  Family  Relu Ram Poonia was elected legislator to the Barwala assembly segment as an Independent candidate in 1996. He had funded the Lok Dal's publicity campaigns and there was speculation that he would run for the party, but he did not. He contested the election as an independent candidate and gained a majority from sympathy votes. Post elections he provided support to the government formed by the Haryana Vikas Party headed by Chief Minister Bansi Lal. He was born into a poor family but earned his wealth through the marketing of bitumen and oil on the black market for industrial usage in the Faridabad area. He invested in agricultural land and built a mansion at his native village Litani. Using the wealth he had accumulated, he made charitable contributions to local groups. He was known to have had cordial relations with the politicians Chaudhary Devi Lal and Om Prakash Chautala. Relu Ram had a son Sunil with his first wife Omi Devi and two daughters, Sonia and Priyanka ('Pammi'), with his second wife Krishna. Sunil was married to Shakuntla and they had a son Lokesh and two daughters Shivani and Preeti. Sonia was married to Sanjeev Kumar. It was reported that Relu Ram and his wife Krishna did not have a cordial relationship. Similarly, Sonia had disputes with her half brother Sunil over agricultural land of around surrounding their farmhouse. This often resulted in heated debates between the two, and weeks before the murders Sonia had threatened Sunil with a revolver. After the murders, Relu Ram's brother Ram Singh Punia and his family moved into the farmhouse in 2004.  Case  In May 2004, Sonia and her husband Sanjiv Kumar were found guilty of murdering Poonia and seven other members of his family by a District and Sessions Court. The motive behind the murders was ascertained to be a property dispute between Sonia and her half brother Sunil. The court sentenced both of them to death. Kumar's eight relatives including his father, mother, and brother were acquitted of the charges. Public prosecutor P. K. Sandhir mentioned that the case was difficult to argue as it was based on circumstantial evidence. A total of 66 witnesses were examined out of more than 109 listed. The Punjab and Haryana High Court reduced the couple's death sentence to life imprisonment in 2005. The death sentence was later reinstated by the Supreme Court in 2007. In October 2007, the Governor of Haryana rejected the couple's plea for mercy. Thereafter, Sonia and Sanjeev filed a mercy petition with the President of India who, under section 72 (1) of the Constitution of India, can grant clemency. In February 2009 Sonia wrote to President Pratibha Patil pursuing a decision of their mercy petition. She requested that her mercy plea be rejected and that she be given the death sentence as imprisonment was becoming difficult for her. She wrote: \\"It is getting impossible to live like an insect in solitary confinement. My life is becoming horrible and giving me more and more pain by every second passing ... I don't have any means to live and want to die once rather than dying with each passing minute\\". Her letter was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs wherein P. Chidambaram, then Home Minister, asked the President to reject her plea noting that \\"even though Sonia is a woman, considering the nature of her crime, she doesn't deserve sympathy.\\" During the process, the couple remained imprisoned at the Ambala jail. In April 2013, President Pranab Mukherjee rejected the clemency request. However, a civil rights group called the People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) filed a petition with the Supreme Court to withhold the death sentence citing delays in rejecting the mercy plea, which the court accepted. Justices P. Sathasivam and M. Y. Eqbal stayed the execution. Later in January 2014, the Supreme Court gave life terms to thirteen more death-row inmates on same grounds.

From then, he gave his heart to Jesus. In June 1998, he started Ashirwad Prayer Centre in Bhuigaon, Vasai. Lord Jesus used him in a mighty way. Through him thousands of people(souls) got saved. In Dec. 2015, he said, “31 years I have served the Lord honestly. Now I want to take rest.” After that he got sick & on 17th Aug., 2016 he entered into the Eternal Glory of God. In Feb. 2016 Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti filed a complaint against Dr. Martin that he is practicing Black Magic. Many said, if he healed so many people then why he couldn’t heal himself. But truth is that Dr. Martin never claimed that he healed the people. He always used to say that LORD JESUS HEALS THE PEOPLE. Second thing, Dr. Martin was not healed by Jesus, because he himself didn’t wanted to get heal. In this period he used to say that, NOW I WANT TO TAKE REST IN ARMS OF MY HEAVENLY FATHER. And thus, God fulfilled the desire of Dr. Martin’s heart. Really, Dr. Martin was a Joker. Controversy In February 2016, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti filed a complaint against Martin. Narendra Dabholkar also filed a police complaint against Martin and his associates for allegedly practicing black magic. In August 2016, he died.

It was designed by Clifford Ernest Plant and built in 1936. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 March 2008.  History  The Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool complex was constructed in 1936 and is the earliest identified Olympic standard pool in Queensland constructed outside Brisbane. Dalby was one of the earliest European settlements on the Darling Downs. The township was surveyed in 1853, the first land sales took place in 1857, and the Town of Dalby was proclaimed a municipality in 1863. Dalby has a long association with swimming as a sport. Initially, a swimming hole in Myall Creek was used, but in 1902 an artesian bore was sunk on the bank and baths were built nearby to take advantage of the bore water. The Dalby Amateur Swimming Club was formed in 1912. In 1920 a new bore was sunk and in 1924 a public baths (the Dalby Bore Baths) was constructed close to it. This facility closed in September 1938, possibly because the new Olympic Pool had supplanted it. From the 1910s, swimming as both a competitive and recreational sport gained rapidly in popularity in Queensland, and indeed, world-wide. In 1908 the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) was formed with the goals of standardising the rules for swimming, diving and water polo, obtaining control of world records, and ensuring the direction of Olympic Games competitions for swimming, diving and water polo. Swimming was given further impetus by the 1924 Olympic Games held in Paris. The Piscine des Tourelles, an 8-lane pool measuring in length by in width, was specially constructed for swimming events, setting the Olympic standards. Swimmers hoping to compete internationally now needed a pool of this size in order to practice effectively. The precise requirements to meet Olympic pool standards have since been refined and cover width, depth, and temperature and light densities. In Brisbane, the Fortitude Valley Baths were rebuilt in 1925-1926 to the Olympic standard, being in length and wide. This pool no longer survives. By the 1930s swimming was a glamorous sport internationally, with sport and medal winners such as Duke Kahanamoku, Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe becoming Hollywood celebrities. In Sydney, four Olympic-standard pools were constructed in the 1930s, municipal councils taking advantage of loans and other financial incentives offered by a government keen to create work by encouraging civic building projects. The pool buildings and surrounds of the new Olympic pools were architect designed. A notable survivor is the North Sydney Olympic Pool Complex opened on 4 April 1936. Design problems with the new large pools included the provision of adequate water filtration and the prevention of algae. The firm of AH Pierce & Co., still associated with commercial pools, imported calcium hypochlorite from England and pool builders took a keen interest in others' pool designs. Pool facilities usually comprised an Olympic-standard pool for recreation and competitions, a smaller pool for children, diving tower, spectators' stand, men's and women's changing rooms and club meeting rooms. By the early 1930s Dalby was experiencing renewed growth and prosperity, reflecting extensive land reclamation in the surrounding district in the wake of the eradication of the prickly pear cactus. This noxious weed had wasted thousands of hectares of agricultural and grazing land in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Annual Report of the Department of Public Lands identified Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles as the towns experiencing the most progress. Under the Intermittent Relief Scheme established during the Depression, the Department of Works remodelled and added to the Dalby State School. The Dalby Court House and Police Station were also built in the first half of the 1930s. In 1933 Dalby Town Council formed an Olympic pool committee. The idea for a pool and tennis courts in Dalby had been suggested in correspondence to the Council by the Dalby Chamber of Commerce in 1931. The Dalby Town Council appointed William J Reinhold as the consulting engineer and Clifford E Plant as the architect. Plant is noted for the Kings Beach Bathing Pavilion and the Redcliffe Bathing Pavilions Group, designed and constructed in the 1930s. Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool, 1940 Excavation work commenced on 1 July 1936 and the first patrons were admitted late in October of that year, with 1550 people using the pool in the first weekend. The complex was completed at a cost of and was officially opened on 14 November 1936 by Frank Cooper, MLA, Minister for Public Instruction, before a crowd of approximately 2,000 people. Commending the Dalby Town Council on its initiative, Cooper commented that there was no town twice or even 10 times the size of Dalby that had a swimming pool like theirs. At the time, the pool was the most modern in Queensland, using the latest filtration and chlorinating equipment to treat the artesian water used to fill the pools. In March 1938 the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alfred James Jones, visited Dalby with the Chairman of the Brisbane Parks and Baths committee in order to inspect it before planning similar pools for Brisbane, though it was some years before such plans were implemented. The opening of the Dalby pool gave an impetus to regional swimming and a number of swimming clubs were formed including the Dalby and District Swimming and Life- Saving Club, and the association of the pool with community sports clubs continues. The first major swimming carnival was held in February 1937. During the Second World War, aircrew from No. 12 Squadron stationed nearby received their forced landing at sea training in the Dalby pool. The 1956 Melbourne Olympics led to an increased interest in competition swimming and most surviving early Olympic pools in Australia date from the preparation for, or interest stemming from, these games. Between 1949 and 1960, Dalby district swimmers gained approximately 100 places in Queensland swimming and diving championships. The pool was visited and used by a number of famous Australian swimmers including Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and members of the Konrad family. During 1957-8 the Dalby pool recorded an annual attendance of 143,167. The original timber spectator stand for the pool was replaced by a concrete stand in 1971 and named for a former pool manager and coach, Arthur G Obst. In 1983, the pool area underwent renovation. This work included the replacement of the circulation pipe work, the plant room and water treatment plant, the concrete concourses around the pool and the substitution of skimmer boxes for scum gutters. More recently, the pools have been lined with fibreglass and fibreglass features have been added to the children's pool. The Dalby Pool Complex remains the venue for large swimming carnivals, one of which, the Dalby Open, attracted 1734 nominations in 2002.  Description  The pool complex is in a parkland setting to the rear of Dalby War Memorial and Gates and adjacent to Myall Creek. It is part of a large recreational precinct which includes a lawn bowls club and croquet club. The open-air pool complex is approached from Patrick Street by twin paths that divide behind the war memorial, to which the pool pavilion forms a backdrop. A formal arrangement of garden beds and flagpoles fills this space. The symmetrically placed entry pavilion is a single storey rectangular building spanning the width of the pool complex. It has a hipped roof with gables at each end of the front and a central gabled porch leading to turnstiles and the pool area. This area contains granite panels commemorating the opening of the pool complex. The building is clad with weatherboards on the lower section with panels of fibrous cement sheeting above. It is lit by six pane casement windows. The south-east part of the building contains a service area and kiosk and club meeting rooms are located in the north-west end of the building. The rear of the building also has a central gabled porch and a timber pergola over a paved area that separates the building from the pool. Positioned between the entry pavilion and the main pool, and at right-angles to the latter, is a children's pool measuring . It has recent additions of fibreglass rocks and play features. The main pool measures . Concrete concourses and lawns surround the pool and a spectators' stand is positioned along one side, with changing rooms beneath. There is a brick plant room at the far end of the pool. Also located within the pool complex grounds is a pool caretaker's residence. This is a small, high-set, timber cottage with an enclosed front verandah. The Arthur G Obst Stand is not the original structure and is not considered significant for heritage purposes.  Heritage listing  Dalby Swimming Pool Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 20 March 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Dalby Swimming Pool complex, constructed and opened in 1936, is important in demonstrating the development of competition swimming in Queensland. As an Olympic standard pool built in the 1930s, it illustrates the surge of public interest both in competitive and recreational swimming during the interwar period. As a facility which demonstrated how artesian water might be used to the advantage of a community, the Dalby Swimming Pool also is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history. It is also important in illustrating the 1930s expansion of civic work in the former prickly pear belt, following the eradication of this pest in the late 1920s and early 1930s. As land cleared of prickly pear cactus was utilised for agriculture, grazing and dairying, towns throughout the prickly pear belt, especially Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles, experienced renewed growth and prosperity. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Dalby Swimming Pool complex is rare as the earliest identified surviving Olympic-sized swimming pool complex in Queensland. It is the earliest known Olympic Pool complex constructed in Queensland outside Brisbane, and retains its two pools (competition and children's), entrance pavilion, and caretaker's residence. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Dalby Swimming Pool Complex has a strong association with the community of Dalby and the surrounding area as an important sports venue for swimming events, enabling Dalby swimmers access to wider Australian competition, and has at times attracted Australian/international swimming stars.

The city is located in the popular Virunga National Park. At least 64 people were killed, as 64 bodies had been located during the search. Officials estimate the death toll to be from 75 to 101. An unknown number of people were injured. The Ugandan rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) were suspected to be behind to attack by the DRC. The incident is another in a series of massacres in Beni that have left over 700 people dead since October 2014. In 2018, a Congolese military tribunal convicted 134 people for the 2016 massacre and killings in previous years. The convicted were a mix of ADF rebels, militia fighters, civilians and local chiefs. Background Since October 2014 over 700 civilians have been killed in a series of massacres in and around Beni alone, with over 1,150 people being killed and kidnapped, and thousands more being displaced in North Kivu province since 2014. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and DRC President Joseph Kabila spoke about seeking a coordinated military strategy against the ADF during a 4 August meeting. On 8 August, less than one week before the massacre, an \\"armed group\\" killed 14 people near Beni. The blame for this attack centred on Mai-Mai ethnic militias, ethnic militant groups, and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. 150 houses were destroyed in this attack that occurred immediately after President Joseph Kabila left the area. The president was in Beni three days before the 14 August massacre. Another attack by the ADF left a group of soldiers and UN peacekeepers wounded not long before the attack. Attack The local catholic bishop, the Nuncio Luis Mariano Montemayor, a UN diplomat Maman Sambo Sidikou and MONUSCO peacekeepers at the site of the massacre, on 26 August. Attackers passed by military bases before going into the city, yet did not attack anyone there. The men came out of the forest near the city, and some were disguised as army members. The attackers were described as using melee weapons, and hacked people to death. Some attackers were spotted with guns, yet they were only seen using the guns as melee weapons. Machetes were also wielded by the attackers, with 51 bodies being found with machete wounds. The attack occurred during nighttime, confirmed Beni mayor Nyonyi Bwanakawa. The DRC claimed that they had found 64 bodies and were still searching, and officials said that the death toll will eventually reach 75 or 101. The number of injured is unknown, although Al Jazeera was able to locate a wounded survivor, who provided an interview. Aftermath =Perpetrators= Congolese officials all blamed the attack on the Islamic Ugandan rebel group called the Allied Democratic Forces, although the attack has many similarities to attacks that are committed by Boko Haram. A Congo Research Group at the New York University claimed that army soldiers have participated in the series of massacres, which includes the one in Beni, although the government strongly denied these claims. In 2018, 134 people were convicted for their involvement in violence in Beni, including the 2016 massacre. Much of the group, a mix of ADF rebels, militia fighters, civilians and local chiefs, were convicted in absentia. 42 were sentenced to death. Only one army officer was convicted. =Domestic reaction= The president of the DRC, Joseph Kabila, labelled the attack as terrorism and issued a statement: \\"The terrorist massacre happening at the moment in the east is not different from what happened in Mali, France, Somalia and other corners of the world\\". After the attack, Kabila held a meeting with the members of the provincial supreme defense council in the capital of North Kivu province, Goma. Many high government officials also attended the meeting. The president then sent members of the national defense council along with Prime Minister Augustin Matata Ponyo to Beni. After arriving in Beni, he issued a statement. Ponyo called the incident a part of asymmetric warfare, and started to work on his delegation's response to the incident. Flags were thrown at half mast and a three day long period of mourning was announced. Six suspects were eventually arrested and their hearing was attended by hundreds of people.http://www.salon.com/2016/08/20/congo_begins_hearing_against_6_rebels_in_insecure_east/ =International reaction= * : Pope Francis called the international reaction to the incident a \\"shameful silence\\" He called for peace and harmony, and issued a statement: \\"My thoughts go to the people of North Kivu, in the DRC, who have been recently hit with fresh massacres, which have for some time been perpetrated in shameful silence, without attracting even as much as our attention. Unfortunately, they are part of the too many innocent people who have no weight on world opinion.\\" * United Methodist Church: A district superintendent of the church was wounded and two of his sisters were killed. The superintendent issued a statement, saying that 101 people were killed. Another leader lost three family members. Bishop Gabriel Unda said that \\"People are terribly suffering\\" from the \\"evil doers\\". She pleaded people to pray with her, while mentioning that the death toll is not yet completely known. * : MONUSCO said that it \\"reiterates its support to the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Congolese National Police\\" to protect the civilian populations of Beni in the wake of the \\"barbaric act committed against the civilian population\\". They also agreed to increase their cooperation in ridding the DNC of armed groups. Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the killing while confirming that the UN had deployed forces. His spokesperson also issued a statement on his behalf, noting the recent string of massacres and the need to \\"bring the assailants to justice\\". =Protests= After the attack, mass protests broke out, especially because of President Joseph Kabila's recent visit before the attack where he promised \\"peace and security\\". People began chanting anti-government slogans, protesting the lack of government security in the wake of thousands of deaths and kidnaps from massacres in the last two years. On 18 August, protests turned violent as people turned on each other and policemen. Flags of the governing People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy were lit on fire. Prime Minister Ponyo was loudly booed as he made a speech. Police and army members fired tear gas into the crowds and warning shots, but to no avail. The protesters barricaded streets, blocking them off. A man was then shot in the head and killed by a policeman, and more violence broke out. In the violence, a policeman was killed, three soldiers were injured, and six civilians were wounded. At least six protesters were violently arrested and taken to a military vehicle, where they were transported away. A woman who people suspected to be a member of the ADF was lynched, stoned, and burnt to death by protesters.

It and its associated structures occupy a 2023 square metre allotment backing onto Starlings Lane. Cunningham Street features a number of significant commercial buildings including the Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices, the former police station and courthouse complex and St John's Anglican Church. The 1935 brick fire station replaced a 1920 timber structure and was extended in 1953 to provide an extra garage and workshop on the ground floor and an upstairs recreation area. Further extensions along the rear of the building were undertaken in 1976. The town of Dalby was laid out by Surveyor EO Moriaty in 1852; part of the expansion of pastoral activities on the Darling Downs. Due to problems with flood levels, a second town survey was completed the following year and the Town Reserve declared in 1855. The Town of Dalby was gazetted as a municipality on 29 August 1863. The extension of the Western railway line to Dalby in 1868 led to a boom that only deflated when the line was extended west in 1877. Further prosperity occurred as a result of the Agricultural Land Purchase Act 1894, which opened up substantial tracts of land previously held by the early pastoralists. This led to closer settlement around Dalby and its development into a major regional centre. The first Dalby Fire Brigade was formed in 1882, but was short-lived because of the failure of local insurance companies to contribute to its financial support. The second Dalby Fire Brigade was initiated under the Fire Brigade Amendment Act 1902 at a meeting in March 1915, and its board was gazetted on 24 July. By October 1916, the fledgling brigade had received its first government subsidy and a manual fire engine was purchased the following year. Land for the fire brigade was acquired in New Street (Allot 3 Section 6) in January 1920. It had been originally taken up in 1863 by John Donovan and transferred to local butcher James Ryan in 1885. It is conjectured that the cottage now utilised as the fire station office was built in 1889 when Ryan took out a mortgage on his property. The land was transferred to Ryan's daughter Margaret in 1910, and in 1919, about six years after she had married and moved to Sydney, she placed the property in the hands of trustees Dalby Mayor James Duncan Morris and Alderman Walter Robertson Hunter, both fire brigade board members. The agreement allowed for the board to build on the site and take out mortgages to finance any improvements. Tenders were called for construction of this first fire station in January 1920 and building proceeded at a cost of . A simple timber garage with a galvanised iron gable roof was erected. Local builders Draney and Co were contracted to enlarge this building in 1923 to provide a board room, which eventually housed the new fire truck purchased six years later. During the early 1930s the Dalby region experienced renewed growth following the eradication of the prickly pear cactus through the introduction of the Cactoblastis cactorum moth in 1925. The prickly pear had devastated the region from the late 19th century and its destruction led to the recovery of thousands of hectares of agricultural land and the Department of Public Lands reporting rapid expansion of agriculture, grazing and dairying around Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles. After the 1932 state election of the Forgan-Smith Government, part of its funds were channelled into what were considered \\"sound\\" public projects providing long-term community benefit, rather than into short-term maintenance projects such as those funded through the Intermittent Relief Scheme. Projects funded directly by the Queensland Department of Public Works included additions to the Dalby School (1935), and a new courthouse and police station (1934). The town's stock of commercial and ecclesiastical buildings was also augmented at this time with: a Bank of New South Wales and National Bank (both no longer extant), the Dalby Olympic Swimming Pool, the Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices, a Presbyterian Church, the Star Theatre (no longer extant) and a Catholic Presbytery (no longer extant). The Fire Brigade Act of 1931 had allowed for boards to make by-laws and those devised by the Dalby Fire Brigade Board were gazetted in August 1934, providing administrative guidelines for the board and firemen. At the board meeting of June 1934, the secretary Harold Edward Thorley presented preliminary plans for a two-storey brick fire station, the estimated cost for which being between and . In August 1934 Toowoomba architect Matthew Williamson produced the final plans for the fire station. Williamson's other Dalby projects included the Presbyterian Church (1933), the Star Theatre (1936, no longer extant) and a number of shops and private dwellings. He was also responsible for numerous projects in Toowoomba, including the Trades Hall (1934) in Russell Street, as well as buildings in Miles, Crows Nest and Oakey. In November 1934, it was reported that a loan had been secured from the Commonwealth Bank, when the tender of submitted by local builder George Ficken was accepted. Before construction was completed, the Forgan-Smith government approved for local authorities and other local bodies (such as hospital, harbour and fire brigade boards) a reduction of 1% in the interest rates of all loans with rates over 4%. This presumably aided the construction of other fire stations and community infrastructure across the state during the 1930s. The Dalby Fire Station was formally opened on Saturday 16 November 1935 by the Home Secretary Ned Hanlon. It was long and wide and built on concrete foundations and footings with concrete floors on a base of broken stone to the appliance rooms and timber flooring elsewhere on the ground floor. The structure comprised some rolled steel and reinforced concrete components, including continuous wall lintels. The ground floor accommodated two fire appliances behind folding timber doors with a recreation room and open timber stairway at the rear. On the interior of this level there was silky oak interior wall panelling to a height of . The upper level had a kitchen, living room, lounge room, three bedrooms, a bathroom and balcony to the street. Fibro sheeting and plaster variously lined the walls of the upper level, with ornamental cornices. The fireplaces on both levels were detailed with Wunderlich bricks and all windows were timber. The external brick walls were solid on the ground floor and included a cavity above the wall lintel. There were glazed brick soldier courses to openings on the first floor and glazed brick sills to the front of the building. The original paintwork to the concrete walls was to be lime wash tinted with burnt sienna, while the lettering on the front was to be finished with gold leaf. Prior to the completion of the Dalby Fire Station in 1935 only four other two-storey, brick fire stations had been built in the state's capital, Brisbane. The sole survivor of these is the 1927 Albion Fire Station, which along with a station at South Brisbane was a part of the network rationalisations undertaken after 1921 by the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board. During the interwar years a number of two-storey fire stations were also built in Brisbane of timber and fibro, including: an upgrade to the Ithaca Fire Station in 1928; a new Yeronga Fire Station in 1934; then three to the same plan: Coorparoo Fire Station in 1935, Nundah Fire Station in 1936 and Wynnum Fire Station in 1938. Generally the layout of all these structures provided accommodation for fire appliances on the ground floor, and a recreation room, kitchen, bathroom and dormitory space, and accommodation for officers and their families on the first floor. The 1935 Dalby station was smaller than some of the Brisbane stations, with space for two fire appliances and a recreation room on the ground floor and living quarters for the chief officer and his family on the upper floor. Accommodation for firemen was provided in a three bedroom cottage on the site built using materials from the 1920 to 1929 fire station garage. By 1949 it was evident that a larger station was required at Dalby to house a new fire engine, and that more bedrooms were needed in the firemen's quarters. Funding was acquired in stages over the next few years from both government and private sources. The extension was built in brick along the north-western side of the fire station during 1953. It included a third engine bay and workshop on the ground floor and a recreation area on the first floor. The new addition was . Additions were also made to the timber firemen's quarters. At this time the adjacent timber low-set cottage was occupied by the mechanic/caretaker. The property owner Margaret Sara (née Ryan) died in Broken Hill in 1953 and the property was transferred to the Dalby Fire Brigade Board on 11 May of the following year. In an effort to better co-ordinate the management of fire brigades across Queensland, the Queensland Fire Brigades Boards Association was formed in 1962-63. The Fire Brigade Act 1964 legislated for Fire Boards to become Body Corporates. The first Queensland Chief Fire Inspector was appointed and the State Fire Services Council was formed as the state moved towards the standardisation of equipment and facilities. The Dalby Fire Brigade continued to upgrade its equipment, with a new fire engine in 1956/7, another in 1965, two-way radios in 1966, and a salvage vehicle in 1967/8. A concrete block smoke room was built in 1970. In mid-1975 tenders were called for further additions to the rear of the main station building to provide a storeroom, board facilities, toilets and office accommodation for the regional fire safety officer (recently appointed) and the chief officer. Dalby builders, JR Perry and Co, were awarded the contract at a cost of $35,974. The extension was completed in mid-1976. Extensions to the fire tower were built in 1978 and a new fire engine was also purchased. The Fire Services Act 1990 led to the amalgamation of a number of departments. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board ceased to exist after June 1990 and the management of the 21 metropolitan stations and the 81 fire boards across the state were amalgamated into the Queensland Fire Services. A further amendment to the Act in 1996 created the Fire and Rescue Authority. The Emergency Services Legislation Act 2001 dissolved this Authority and vested its assets with the Queensland Government. The self-contained living areas on the first floor of the Dalby Fire Station continued to be occupied by the Chief Officer or Captain until the late 1990s. The cottage was occupied by one of the firemen until the mid-1990s. At that time it was restumped and ramps were added at the front, when it was converted into an area office of the Department of Community Safety's Queensland Fire and Rescue Service South Western Region. The former men's quarters were relocated to Rangemoore Winery in December 2000. The accommodation areas of the fire station are now used by visiting emergency services personnel, officers attending courses from regional towns as well as by visiting relieving officers. In 2009 a temporary garage was erected on the north-western side of the fire station to accommodate a new tanker appliance. Dalby is now one of 42 fire stations in the South Western Region, which includes the major towns of Toowoomba and Warwick, and extends west through Cunnamulla and Quilpie to the border with the South Australia. It remains an operational auxiliary fire station, although no longer permanently houses fire brigade staff. A desktop survey comparing the fire brigade and station files held by the Queensland State Archives, the current listing maintained by the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service of its fire stations, historical images featured on Picture Australia and current street views on Google Maps revealed that the station at Dalby is the oldest remaining regional fire station still in operation. Only one remaining interwar station was possibly constructed earlier, that at Warwick, however it is no longer in use. There appear to be three others remaining in operation in regional Queensland: at Innisfail (1937), Charleville (1938) and Gympie (1940). The six stations built before the Dalby and Warwick stations, those at Rockhampton, Barcaldine, Gladstone, Cunnamulla, Cairns and Maryborough) have all been demolished.  Description  The Dalby Fire Station is located in the southern corner of a large land parcel addressing New Street about halfway between Cunningham Street to the south-east and the Highway to the north-west. Starlings Lane runs along the rear of the block. The fire station building comprises a core (1935) constructed on reinforced concrete foundations with an upper structure combining elements of steel, reinforced concrete framing and brickwork. It has a gable roof behind a parapet on two sides. It has brick two-storey additions along its north-western side (1953) and its rear (1976), both of which have skillion roofs. A steel garage with skillion roof has been installed along its north-westernmost side and is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The core's facade addressing New Street is symmetrical and employs painted cement-render in making its various classical motifs. It features twin garage doors on the ground floor flanked by rendered pilasters. On the first floor these pilasters flank a wide balcony, the long opening to which is decorated by four tapered ionic columns and a wrought iron balustrade. The name of the building is displayed in raised lettering across the entablature and the date of construction, 1935, is featured in the parapet above. The exposed stretcher bond brickwork to the balcony is tuck pointed, while above the two French windows and single glazed door are soldier courses of glazed brick. Its floor is unpainted concrete. The central single-leaf door has twelve lights, while those either side of it have eight lights in each leaf. All these feature textured and semi-transparent glass, while the rectangular fanlights are clear glass. The 1935 core is constructed with solid brick walls on the ground floor and cavity brick walls on the upper level, reflected in the varying brickwork bonds employed on the south-eastern side facade still visible: English bond below with headers picked out by dark colouring and stretcher bond above. Also on this facade a continuous concrete lintel separates the levels. The latter additions are completed in stretcher bond and also use continuous lintels. The gable roof of the 1935 structure is clad in metal sheeting, falling to a parapet wall along the south-eastern side and to a central gutter on its north-western side, which also serves the skillion roof of the 1953 extension. The north-western side of this extension has a parapet. The original chimney pierces the gable roof of the 1935 core. Only one original six-light, double-hung timber window remains, internalised by the extent of the 1953 extension, while all others are double-hung aluminium. The lintels to these windows are largely rendered and painted. Access to the building is via a side door on the south-eastern facade or via a rear door facing Starlings Lane and the north east. Inside the 1935 core a large area at the front houses two fire appliances with hooks, racks and shelves either side for equipment. To the rear of this space are a communications and operations office and a stairway leading from the north- eastern corner to the upper level. The stair has its original timber balustrade and has been enclosed underneath for storage. The office walls are lined with laminated board panelling, revealing only the outline of the original fireplace and chimney. Ceilings are high and feature original timber cover strips over fibro sheeting, with decorative cornices and suspended fluorescent lighting. The 1976 rear extension houses a small office and ablution facilities on the ground floor, while the 1953 extension accommodates further space for a fire appliance and a workshop at the rear. In the garages the floors are painted concrete. A roll-a-door at the rear of the 1953 garage provides access to the rear of the allotment. An undercover parking space is provided immediately outside this door, under the 1976 first floor. On the upper floor of the 1935 extension at the rear are a kitchen, living area, bathroom and toilet. At its front over the garage space are two bedrooms, one of which has been enlarged to include the corridor space that led to the balcony on New Street. The upper level of the 1953 extension contains bedroom and training spaces, while that from 1976 contains bedrooms and a balcony. Other than the internal stair, access is gained to this upper floor balcony via an external steel staircase. The floor levels differ between the later extensions and the 1935 building core, the former being lower. The fireplace in the upper level living room retains its original Wunderlich glazed brick and rendered concrete surround. The kitchen, bathroom and toilet fittings are not original. The front two bedrooms have built-in wardrobes, while the former third bedroom is used as a storeroom. All internal walls and ceilings are clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Ceilings throughout the upper level are high. The areas on the first floor of the 1953 addition are accessed via doors cut out of the original window openings in the north-western wall of the 1935 building. The opening between the lounge and the training room has been widened to accommodate two six-light French doors with opaque textured glass. Vehicular access is either via New Street along the north-eastern side of the fire station or through double gates on Starlings Lane.  Heritage listing  Dalby Fire Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 October 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The 1935 core of the Dalby Fire Station, comprising a two-storey brick, steel and concrete structure with a classically influenced street facade, is the oldest surviving, and longest operating, fire station in regional Queensland. The 1935 building core, with its 1953 and 1976 extensions, demonstrate the evolution of fire fighting services in the state's regional towns. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Dalby Fire Station demonstrates the principal characteristics of a regional interwar fire station including: a central location in the town; ground floor accommodation for the fire appliances and operational facilities; and first floor living accommodation for the chief fire officer. The 1935 Dalby Fire Station core and its 1953 and 1976 additions exemplify the evolving functions of a regional fire brigade which has operated continuously from this New Street site since 1920.

He worked in various roles until the early 1900s, commanding numerous vessels during that time. During a flood in 1861, while in command of the sternwheeler Onward, Pease rescued 40 people from a flood in the area of Salem, Oregon. Family George Anson Pease was born at Stuyvesant Landing, Columbia County, New York State, on September 30, 1830. His father was Norman Pease (b. 1805; d. Jan 4, 1847, age 43), who was an architect and builder in New York State. His mother was Harriet McAllister, who moved to Oregon in 1862 from New York, and who died in 1890, at Oregon City, Oregon, at the age of 90 years. Pease, the oldest of the family, had six siblings, one of whom died in infancy. The others, all sisters, were: * Maria A. Pease, who married Alexander Warner; as of 1904 resided in the Mount Tabor neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. * Martha E. Pease, who married John Howser, was living in Portland in 1890, but by 1904 she was widowed and living in New York City. * Jane Pease, who married A. M. Cannon and who died in Spokane Falls, Washington, in 1893. * Harriet E. Pease, who married Capt. Charles W. Pope (1831-1871). * Pamela Pease, who married Alfred Herring and who died in Portland in 1887. Education and training Pease and his sisters were all educated in the subscription schools of New York State. At age fifteen he started working with his father to learn the carpenter and joiner's trade. When his father died, in 1847, Pease completed his apprenticeship with another man. Move to California In 1849, news of the California Gold Rush induced Pease to go to the west, by way of a ship around Cape Horn. Pease arrived on September 30, 1849. Pease worked in the mines for a while, where he achieved some success in the following winter, but he was cheated by his partner, and ended up with nothing. Relocation to Oregon Pease then went north to the Oregon Territory, arriving July, 1850 on the brig Annie E. Maine, crossing the Columbia River bar on July 21. Pease bought a pair of flatboats and ran them on the Willamette River from Milwaukie, Oregon to Oregon City and later from Portland. Pease began in a keel-boat in 1850, taking freight from Portland to Oregon City for $20 a ton. The boat was propelled by Native Americans with poles, oars and sails. Steamboat career When in 1851, the first steamboat, the sidewheeler Canemah was brought to the upper Willamette River, Pease became a deckhand and a clerk on the vessel for six months. He also served on the early Willamette steamers Hoosier, Oregon, and Franklin. In the summer of 1852, Pease supervised the construction of the sidewheeler Oregon, at Fairfield Landing, on the Willamette River. Elk was built in 1857 at Canemah, Oregon by Capt. Christian E. Sweitzer, François X. Matthieu, George A. Pease, and John Marshall In 1858, with others Pease bought Elk, and, in 1860, Onward In 1860 Pease help build, and owned five-ninths, of the steamer Enterprise. Pease ran Enterprise for two years and placed it into the People's Transportation Company, which had been organized in 1862. Also in 1860, Rival was built at Oregon City, Oregon by William and John Dement, two brothers who were merchants in Oregon City, and Capt. George A. Pease, who became her first captain.Wright, ed., Lewis & Dryden Marine History, at 92 and 108. During the great flood of the Willamette River in November and December 1861, which among other things destroyed Champoeg and Linn City the steamer Onward, under Captain Pease, was able to run through the streets of Salem to rescue people. For Onward this started out as a routine upriver journey from Canemah. The river was cluttered with debris from riverside houses and landings that had been washed downstream by the flood. By the time Onward reached Salem, her ordinary commercial operation turned into one of rescuing people from the flooded city. In 1863, Pease built a new independent steamer, also named Enterprise, at Canemah, Oregon. Pease was backed by a company formed by his brother in law, Capt. Charles. W. Pope (1831-1871), Capt. Nat H. Lane, Sr. (1823-1878), C. Friendly, Judge Riley E. Stratton, C. Crawford, James Wilson, C.W. Rea, and S. Ellsworth. The new Enterprise was launched in November 1863, and ran independently for a short time under Pease. Pease become connected with the People’s Transportation Company in 1865. For some years the captain was a member of the board of directors, but in 1871, all the assets of the P.T. Company were sold to Benjamin Holladay Pease remained in his employ as superintendent of Holladay’s river lines. Pease also supervised for Holladay the construction of large hotel at Clatsop Beach, in 1872. Holladay afterward sold out to the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. Pease stayed on as a captain for O.S.N. In 1875 Pease ran Bonita from Portland to Astoria, Oregon for O.S.N. After this he ran Dixie Thompson and Emma Hayward for O.S.N. until 1878 or 1879, when he resigned and became a pilot. Piloting career In 1888 a law was passed which provided that a ship need not take a pilot if it accepted a tow. The law resulted in giving the towing on the Columbia River to the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Pease was the only state-licensed pilot in their employ. After some years Pease went to work for the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. In March 1889, the pilots and engineers of the Oregon Railway & Navigation company went on strike for higher wages. On Friday, March 8, 1889, the pilots and the engineers appointed three men each to negotiate with the company, with George Pease being one of men selected by the pilots. In 1896 Pease was appointed captain of the United States government dredge. W. S. Ladd, and remained until May. 1903, when he resigned and quit active work. Mining and prospecting In 1855 Pease went out on a gold prospecting expedition with 25 other men. While they were out the Indian war broke out. Pease owned some mines in Idaho. Marriage and children In Linn City, Oregon on December 26, 1857, Pease was married to Mildred A. Moore. Moore had been born in Illinois and been brought to Oregon with her family when she was five years old. Mildred A. Moore died in Portland on October 22, 1879., at the age thirty-seven years. The couple had four children, of whom two died as children, Francis A. Pease, age six, and George E. Pease, age two. The two children who survived were Archibald Leon Pease (1858-1919)[https://digitalcollections.ohs.org/pease-archibald-l-2 Pease, Archibald L. and Harriet M. Pease Colbert (1861-1948), both of whom were married and had children as of 1904. Archibald L. Pease was also a steamboat captain, who, in 1893 was the master of the side-wheeler T.J. Potter, one of the most famous steamboats to operate on the Columbia River. Fraternal, social and business associations Pease became a Mason in 1855, in Oregon City, and acted as master of Multnomah Lodge, which was the oldest on the Pacific coast. Pease was a charter member of Portland Masonic Lodge No. 55, and was a Royal Arch Mason, a charter member and Thirty-Second Degree Mason of the Scottish Rite and a member of the Al Kader Temple. Pease was also a member of the Odd Fellows, being in 1857 secretary of Oregon Lodge No. 3, I.O.O.F. Pease also belonged to the Pioneers' Association of Oregon and Historical Society, the Masters and Pilots' Association of United States Steam Vessels, and of the American Brotherhood of Steamboat Captains and Pilots. Political affiliation Pease was a Republican and was at one time a member of the Oregon City Council. Pease was strongly pro-Union during the American Civil War. On Tuesday, June 11, 1861 in command of Onward, he carried a pro-Union crowd upriver to a large Union rally at Corvallis, Oregon, with the trip from Canemah taking two days. Around the state in the summer of 1861, flag poles were being set up in various towns, on which the national colors were hoisted. Confederate sympathizers in Oregon, referred to derogatorily as \\"secesh\\" by opposing Unionists, occasionally replaced the flag of the Union with that of the Confederacy. At the now-vanished town of Linn City, Oregon, on Monday, July 1, 1861, Pease and fellow steamboat captain James D. Miller led a group of pro-Union citizens in raising a flag pole, at the top of which was placed a Union flag made by the women of the city.  Death Pease died on January 22, 1919, in Portland, Oregon at his residence at 784 Pettigrove Street. Interment was at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City.Oregon City Vessels commanded, built, or piloted The following is a non-exclusive list of vessels owned (in whole or in part) commanded, built or piloted by George A.

Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court case addressing the question of whether United States Forest Service regulations, federal land use statutes and regulations, or the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, preempt the California Coastal Commission's imposition of a permit requirement on operation of an unpatented mining claim in a national forest. The court ruled that even if federal land is not included in the Coastal Zone Management Act's interpretation of \\"coastal zone,\\" the act does not automatically preempt all state regulation of activities on federal lands. Facts Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California purchased the property and mineral rights to a large deposit of white limestone on Mount Pico Blanco in the Los Padres National Forest on the Big Sur coast of California in 1963. The limestone deposit is made up of two large, pharmaceutical grade limestone bodies known as the Pico Blanco body and the Hayfield body. It is the only high-grade deposit on the Pacific Coast outside Alaska within three miles of potential marine transportation. Reserves have been estimated to be from 600 million to a billion tons, reportedly the largest in California, and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains. In 1980, Granite Rock submitted to the Forest Service a five-year plan to remove substantial amounts of limestone from a quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary. The Forest Service prepared an Environmental Assessment of the plan and recommended some modifications, which Granite Rock implemented. When Graniterock obtained the permit in 1983, it began to excavate a open pit mine. The California Coastal Commission required Granite Rock to apply for a coastal development permit for any mining undertaken after the date of notification. The Coastal Commission did not seek to prohibit mining of the unpatented claim, only to regulate mining activity in accordance with the detailed requirements of the California Coastal Act. Granite Rock filed an action in U.S. District Court claiming that the Coastal Commission permit requirement was preempted by Forest Service regulations, by the Mining Act of 1872, and by the Coastal Zone Management Act. The District Court denied Granite Rock's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court's decision, holding that the Coastal Commission permit requirement was preempted by the Mining Act of 1872 and Forest Service regulations. The Coastal Commission appealed to the Supreme Court. Opinion Granite Rock suggested that the Property Clause not only vests unlimited power in Congress over the use of federally owned lands, but also exempts federal lands from state regulation, whether or not those regulations conflict with federal law. The Supreme Court previously held that \\"the State is free to enforce its criminal and civil laws\\" on federal land so long as those laws do not conflict with federal law. The court held that because Congress specifically disclaimed any intention to preempt preexisting state authority in the Coastal Zone Management Act, even if all federal lands are excluded from the Coastal Zone Management Act definition of \\"coastal zone\\", the act does not automatically preempt all state regulation of activities on federal lands. They ruled in favor of the Coastal Commission.  Results  Although Granite Rock's five- year plan of operations had expired by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, it still had the right to reapply for a forest service permit and request review of the permit by the coastal commission. It did not reapply and has not indicated if it will. It still owns the land.

The membership is free to join, and guests are given 5 points for every dollar spent at hotels in the network. It is the largest points-based loyalty reward program for independent hotels in North America. The company was founded in 2010 and is based in Palo Alto, California. History The company was founded in May 2010 in Palo Alto, California by former Expedia executive, Jeff Low (who also serves as the company's CEO). Low had previously been responsible for the creation of Expedia's \\"Thank You\\" rewards program. At its outset, Stash had enlisted 65 hotels (including boutiques, spas, and resorts) in 50 cities mostly across the United States. By August, those numbers had increased to 79 hotels in 63 cities including Boston, San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and others. In 2011, the network included 150 properties, including one in the United States Virgin Islands. In early 2014, Stash became the largest loyalty reward program for independent hotels in North America. It also began fostering a larger presence in the Caribbean. In January 2014, a study conducted by researchers from Cornell University, Ithaca College, and Michigan State University showed that hoteliers who had enrolled in the Stash Hotel Rewards program saw an average increase of incremental revenue between $400,000 and $780,000 annually. In 2015, Stash introduced the Stash Hotel Rewards Visa Card which gives cardholders points for staying at any hotel whether it's in the Stash network or not. By 2016, the company's network included over 160 properties in the United States, Panama, and the Caribbean. Operation Stash Hotel Rewards' main product offering is a loyalty reward program for a network of nearly 200 independent hotels in the United States (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico), Canada, Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean. It is free to sign up for the program, and guests who enroll are awarded 5 points for every dollar spent at in-network hotels. Members earn 3 points per dollar at highly-rated independent hotels that have been designated “Stash Approved” when booked on the Stash website. Those points can then be redeemed for a free stay at any in-network hotel, and there are no blackout or expiration dates. Stash differs from most traditional loyalty programs in that it allows individual properties to set the number of points required to redeem a free night. For instance, a hotel in-season may increase the number of points required to redeem a free stay while an out-of-season hotel may decrease the number. In 2015, Stash launched the Stash Hotel Rewards Visa Card. The card was developed in association with Synchrony Financial. In May 2018, Stash filed a lawsuit against Synchrony in California for breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation. The card was discontinued in 2018.

Background On 8 April 2016, rebels from the Hawar Kilis Operations Room captured al-Rai and more than a dozen other villages, but withdrew after an ISIL counteroffensive 3 days later that recaptured almost all the villages they have lost. The rebels also briefly took over the town for a few hours in June before being driven out. The battle On 15 August 2016, after heavy artillery bombardment rebels began to storm the al-Rai grain silos and captured the silos along with several other positions. However, they were forced to withdraw the next morning after an ISIL counterattack from the north which recaptured all the points ISIL lost. Landmines played a role in slowing down the offensive. On 17 August, FSA fighters launched a second assault after targeting IS positions with rocket artillery, breaking through the first lines of defense and re-entering the town. The FSA blew up 3 car bombs during the battle and fully captured al-Rai and its border crossing later that day, taking a number of surrendering ISIL militants as prisoners of war. On the same day, the USAF operating as part of the CJTF-OIR conducted air support for the rebels during the battle by bombing several IS units near al-Rai. Fighting continued in the outskirts of the town as ISIL retained its headquarters in nearby Dudyan. Due to the short time given to rebels to fortify the area, IS launched a rapid counter-offensive from the east on 19 August and recaptured the grain silos and nearby hilltops. However, the rebels repelled the attack on the town and claimed to have killed more than 10 IS fighters. FSA fighters also recaptured the grain silos the next day. Aftermath On 20 August, a large number of rebels and a military convoy containing more than 50 vehicles loaded with heavy and medium weapons from al-Rai were transferred to the Turkish border with Jarabulus, as the Turkish Armed Forces prepared for an attack on Jarabulus. Between 27 and 28 August, the rebels claimed to had capture three villages east of al-Rai. However, it was reported that on 27 August, IS recaptured al-Rai.

It was designed by Hall & Phillips and built in 1932. It is also known as Darling Downs Northern School Support Centre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999.  History  The former Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices, the third to be built, were constructed in 1932 to a design by Hall and Phillips Architects. Hill and Brown's tender for for the combined Council Chambers and School of Arts was accepted on 4 August 1931. The first settlement of Myall Creek (Dalby) occurred when Henry Stuart Russell built a slab and bark hut in 1846 for the use of Samual Stewart and his family. Stewart had been Russell's hut keeper at Cecil Plains for five years prior to moving to Myall Creek. A number of similar buildings were constructed in the same area over the following years. After several approaches to the New South Wales Government by residents (the separation of Queensland had not occurred), surveyor EO Moriaty was instructed to lie out a township of one square mile at Myall Creek. Due to a mistake in the flood levels however, the New South Wales Government did not accept this 1852 survey plan. In 1853, Captain Samuel Augustus Perry, Assistant Surveyor General was sent to resurvey the site for urban settlement. The nucleus of the township was laid out on the grid plan regulations adopted by Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales. It was Captain Perry who renamed the town \\"Dalby\\". The first official land sales occurred in April 1857. By 1855, the Dalby Police District had been declared with a Chief Constable and a court of Petty Sessions. The Town of Dalby was proclaimed a municipality in 1863 by Sir George Bowen, Governor of Queensland. The new municipality had a Town Council of six, led by Mayor Frederick Roche. Dalby's first town hall and council offices stood on a Reserve in Scarlett Street. The area also included a Reserve for a School of Arts. In 1889 this building was destroyed by fire. The Council moved again, only to have the building destroyed by fire in 1909. Following the fire, the Council relocated to new premises in Marble Street. This was a dual purpose building combining the Council Chambers and the town clerk's residence. During this time, the School of Arts branch of the Council had moved to the corner of Cunningham and Stuart Streets. This area was becoming more popular with local businesses and, in 1930, following a fire which destroyed the School of Arts building, the third Council Chamber Offices were built on the site. The old Marble Street office was removed to Kaimkillenbun where it was altered and renovated to become the Roman Catholic Church of that district. The Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices were opened on Saturday 13 February 1932 by the Hon Arthur Edward Moore, Premier of Queensland.Download The Mayor of Dalby at the time was Alderman Thomas Jack. Dalby's Town Clerk, Mr Thorley, acted voluntarily as Superintendent of works. The building incorporated a School of Arts. Insurance from the damage to the old School of Arts building helped to fund the construction of the new Council Chambers with the Dalby Town Council contributing to the overall cost of construction. As the Council had had problems with fire in the past, the new Chamber Offices included a strong room which housed valuable books and records. Extensions to the School of Arts were opened by Premier Ned Hanlon on 16 November 1935. The building is no longer the seat of local government. It has previously been occupied by Education Queensland and the Darling Downs Northern School Support Centre. In 2016 it houses the Dalby Chamber of Commerce & Industry and other commercial tenants.  Description  Front view, 2008 The former Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices is a single storey rendered brick building on the corner of Cunningham and Stuart Streets and Groom Lane. The Cunningham Street section has a symmetrical facade with art deco detailing, consisting of a centrally located, projecting portico with a recessed entrance, flanked by three long, narrow casement windows surrounded by moulded architraves. Fluted pilasters are located on each side of the windows. The double, timber-panelled entrance doors have a breezeway with decorative leadlighting. Similar window and decorative detail continue along the Stuart Street facade, which is divided into ten bays by pilasters. The moulded parapet forms a gable in the centre of the facade with the Dalby Town Council's shield located at the centre of the gable. The south elevation (Groom Lane side) and the western elevation are face brick. Internally, the building comprises the highly intact, centrally located, former Council Chambers and extant strong room. The Council Chambers has a parquet floor, a timber dado on all four walls with timber screenings on the windows. A gap in the wall showing brickwork indicates where a plaque was located giving names of Dalby Council members. Changes have occurred to the other offices with the installation of screens to provide for office space, the ceiling has also been lowered. In the front office, which contains the original timber public counter, the ceiling is decorative plaster with decorative cornices are located in the office which contains the strong room. A brass plaque fixed to the wall commemorates the opening of the former Council Chambers by the Premier.  Heritage listing  The former Dalby Town Council Chambers and Offices was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Dalby Town Council Chambers is significant as it demonstrates the growth and development of Dalby and the surrounding area and the increasing self confidence placed in the town by the Council and by the local population. As the site of the School of Arts prior to the construction of the hall, and with the building housing a School of Arts when constructed, the place demonstrates the continued public use of the property for over 60 years. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Dalby Town Council Chambers, a brick and concrete rendered building, is significant as one of only about six buildings extant in Dalby dating from the early 1930s. Other buildings include the former Wambo Shire Council Chambers and the Dalby Fire Station, both of which have Georgian elements in their designs and the former Union Bank. Internally, contributing to its significance, the former meeting room of the Dalby Town Council remains highly intact with timber panelling and screening. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Dalby Town Council Chambers is significant as example of an interwar building with Art Deco elements especially the decorative moulded relief work. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located at the corner of Cunningham Street, the unpretentious yet elegant building provides an integral civic contribution to the streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Further, it held a long association with the people of Dalby and surrounding areas as a focal point for social, and community functions. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Dalby Town Council Chambers is significant for its association with the well-known Brisbane architectural firm, Hall and Phillips, in practice from 1929-1948. Thomas Ramsay Hall had previously been in partnership with George Gray Prentice as Hall and Prentice.

Davenport came to national attention when, in 1996, she sold her art gallery to establish a new breast cancer support initiative, which has since opened centres in seven locations across the UK, with another three planned. Early life  Sara Davenport was born in London in 1962 and grew up between London and Herefordshire. She went to Cambridge University (1980–83) and read History of Art. After graduating, she worked at Hodder and Stoughton publishers before returning to the art world, selling 18th and 19th century paintings at the Cadogan Gallery, Pont St, London. In 1985, she opened the Sara Davenport Gallery in Walton Street, Knightsbridge – one of the only galleries in the world to specialise exclusively in 18th & 19th Century dog paintings. She owned the gallery until 1996. Charity In 1993, her children's nanny, Wendy Ricketts, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Davenport noted in regard to the National Health Service (NHS) that, \\"while the dedication of the doctors was indisputable from a medical point of view, the mental and emotional support that the NHS offered was lacking\\". After speaking to patients, nurses and doctors, who shared similar concerns, she realised she had spotted a gap in the care these patients were receiving. She resolved to ensure there existed \\"one centre in which a range of services for breast cancer sufferers were available under one roof\\" – information, support, counselling and the widest range of complementary therapies available in Britain\\". She approached several large charities, proposing that they set up and manage clinics based on her concept across the country for which she would fundraise and raise the initial capital investment. The charities she approached rejected the proposal and it became clear that if she wanted her concept to become reality, she would have to make it happen herself. As a result, on 10 October 1996, Davenport retired as an art dealer and sold her entire gallery collection (alongside a substantial portion of her private collection) at Bonhams Auction House in Knightsbridge, London. In this way, together with the sale of the lease to her gallery, she raised the money to buy an initial building for the Breast Cancer Haven's use, and she committed to giving the charity a 20-year lease at a peppercorn rent to get the charity off the ground – thereby making a donation which would be worth millions over the first two decades of the charity's existence. It took six months before she found the right location for the charity's first centre – a dilapidated chapel in Fulham Broadway, close to both The Royal Marsden Cancer Hospital and the specialist Breast Cancer Unit at Charing Cross Hospital. A fundraising campaign was launched to raise funds for the chapel's renovation and for the first two years of running costs. A board of trustees was formed, which included Jeremy Leigh Pemberton, brother of the former Governor of the Bank of England, who became the charity's first chairman. The first Breast Cancer Haven in London was opened by the charity's Patron, the Prince of Wales, in February 2000, and since then, further centres have opened in Hereford (in January 2004), Leeds (in October 2008), Hampshire (in October 2015), Wessex (in October 2015), Worcester (in January 2016) and another in London. Personal life Sara Davenport has two children, Sophie and Alexia, with her ex-husband, Adrian Kyriazi.

The headquarters of the company was formerly in Schorndorf in Baden-Württemberg until 2006 when it relocated to Stuttgart. Whirlpool has closed its three plants in Calw (refrigerators / freezers), Neunkirchen (dishwashers) and Schorndorf (washers and dryers). Since 2012 all Bauknecht branded products have been manufactured outside Germany. History The company was founded in 1919 by Gottlob Bauknecht as an electrical workshop in Neckartenzlingen. He received recognition for the first time for his self- developed universal electric motor \\"Landfreund\\". But it was only in the postwar Germany when the company made its big step in the production of electrical appliances, starting in 1948 with the kitchen appliances \\"Allfix\\". In 1951, the first Bauknecht refrigerator was produced, in 1958 the first washing machine, and in 1964 the first dishwasher. On 9 September 1976, the company founder died at the age of 84 years, leaving his sons the management. Because of some loss-making foreign investments and the withdrawal of banks from other financing commitments, on 13 May 1982 a settlement was requested. On 29 October 1982, the District Court of Stuttgart paved the way for bankruptcy over the assets of Bauknecht. On 2 November 1982 Volker Grub, the liquidator, signed a takeover agreement with the German division of Philips (Deutsche Philips Industrie AG). Since 1989, Bauknecht Hausgeräte GmbH has been part of the American group Whirlpool Corporation. The Neunkirchen facility in Saarland developed and built dishwashers from 1971. In 1996, the European Technology Centre for dishwashers was also settled in Neunkirchen. The Global Development Center for washing machines and dryers, in which the large volume washers for the US market were produced was sited in Schorndorf. At the beginning of 2012, the automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen took over the plant in Neunkirchen with 240 out of the 280 local employees, in order to expand its production capacity in transmission components. After retraining, the employees who previously mounted dishwashers, manufactured vehicle transmissions.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung vom 5.

The episode was written by Michael Duggan, and was directed by Aaron Lipstadt. Plot Opening quote: \\"We don't believe, we only fear.\\" Renard (Sasha Roiz) tells Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) he will leave for Europe to discuss the family crisis. Meanwhile, a family takes their son, Daniel (Gabriel Suttle) to a church to get an exorcism. During the exorcism, Daniel kills the monsignor, wounds the seminary student and then hides. During the investigation, Nick and Hank find Daniel in the church and take him to St. Joseph's Hospital for a diagnosis. They talk with Mr. Keary (Tim Griffin), who explains that about a year ago, Daniel began to change mentally and physically. Nick and Hank begin to deduce that Daniel is a Wesen. Renard arrives at Vienna and is picked by Meisner (Damien Puckler), who sets him in a safe house as the Royals may send someone to kill him. Meanwhile, Adalind (Claire Coffee) is called by someone who states that he'll send a car so she can go to a house. The student wakes up and tells Nick and Hank that what he saw wasn't Daniel, it was instead a true demon. Nick and Hank then see Daniel change into the \\"demon\\". Upon telling Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner), they deduce that Daniel is a very rare and much feared Grausen. The stories state that through lack of better understanding of the cause, they presumed perhaps some kind of Wesen spirit would invade a child's body, and if said Grausen were left to grow into adulthood they'd invariably become much feared psychopaths wreaking total havoc. So they have to follow Wesen rules and need to report it to the Wesen Council; where the punishment for Daniel would be a sudden disappearance leading to a death sentence. However, if they don't report it, then they too might incur a death sentence for their non-reporting and disloyalty. De Groot (Nurmi Husa) dispatches Alexander (Spencer Conway) to kill Daniel. While investigating in the books, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) finds that as there were high blood cell count, fever and his stressed immune system, they may be dealing with an infectious disease. They question the parents and discover that during a visit to Jordan, Daniel swam in the Dead Sea and then began experiencing flu-like symptoms. The doctors gave him medication and he was soon fine. In the safe house, Renard and Meisner are attacked by two men from the Verrat and kill them and escape to the sewers, certain more will come. Recalling a study made by a colleague, Juliette deduces that perhaps the kid is infected by some kind of rare parasite similar to toxoplasmosis and if so, if they can find a way to kill the protozoa inside Daniel, the illness/behavior will stop and they could save him before more drastic actions are taken against him by 'The Council'. Alexander visits Monroe and Rosalee and they are forced to tell him the location of Daniel (though Monroe insists on informing Nick). Nick, Hank and Juliette rush to Daniel's room in the hospital but he'd already been discharged, his parents already taken him home. Alexander tries to kill Daniel but Daniel fights back and escapes to the woods. Due to the low temperature, the parasitic organisms perish and Daniel returns back to normal. Nick decides to release Alexander and gives him Daniel's medical report proclaiming him cured. Alexander gives the records to De Groot while Nick writes his notes on the diaries, adding that: Subsequent tests proved that hypothermia is able to kill the unicellular eukaryotic organism, identified as Daemoni Adspicio, which is the cause of 'Grausen'. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 6.32 million people, earning a 1.6/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Frosty the Snowman, Bones, and Shark Tank. This was a 10% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.73 million viewers with a 1.3/4. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the episode was watched by 9.46 million viewers with a 2.9 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics.Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Tops Adults 18-49 Ratings, 'Glee' Leads Percentage Gains & 'The Blacklist' Wins Total Viewer Increase in Week 11 =Critical reviews= \\"Stories We Tell Our Young\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"The premise for 'Stories We Tell Our Young' didn't look promising. Grimm had already dealt with a case involving a church last year in 'The Good Shepherd' that amounted to one of the worst episodic tangents of the season. And nothing makes The Exorcist look terrifying like lame network television appropriating the bare bones of an exorcism plot, which is what every promo suggested. But 'Stories' is actually a perfect example of how much Grimm has grown in the past few years. It takes small elements of previous episodes that either felt incomplete on their own or simply didn't work and blends them into a much stronger story that doesn't need a direct fairy tale equivalent in order to build out the world of the show to include larger forces.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.9 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The 'Grausen' is a very interesting take on what's become standard Grimm fare, and it's a pathogen that so rarely infects a human that the Wesen, Grimms, and Royals all got together to banish the victim – thinking they were possessed. I've really come to enjoy the episodes that expand the scope and richness of the world; these entries might not propel the main plot forward, but they do expose the history. In a show that gives ancestry and past generations so much weight and value expanding the canvas with the personalities, thoughts, whims, and knowledge of the prior generations is appreciated.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"After last week's surprisingly underwhelming (sorry!) 'El Cucuy,' this week's 'Stories We Tell Our Young' seemed to have everything, swiftly putting Grimm back on track with its big theme for the season sans zombie-flashback-Nick. Renard is being all sneaky in Vienna while Hank and Nick hold down the fort Stateside. And 'Stories We Tell Our Young' was another one of those old-ways-vs.-new-ways episodes, but since those tend to be so good, I don't really mind that out of six episodes this season, maybe like four of them have shared the same general message. I love it when Grimm delves deeper into Wesen and Grimm history, culture, and norms—the lack of which, in the past, had always stopped me from thinking of Grimm as a great show, rather than a merely good show.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Stories We Tell Our Young"},{"id":"51356021","text":"The Cayos Limones or Lemon Keys are a group of Caribbean islands in the San Blas Archipelago in Guna Yala province of Panama.

The name of the Batlhaping loosely translates to; \\" those with an affinity for fish\\". After Barolong settled on the banks of the Orange River known as Kolong, fish became a staple of their diet. There were several harassing raids by the Ndebele which led to most Barolong to move Northwards to modern day Ganyesa. Those who were left behind stayed and fought back against the raids of the Ndebele and they were referred to from that point as \\"those who remained behind to eat fish\\", thus this became their name. This however did not mean that they were independent from Barolong. \\"Tlhapi\\" means \\"Fish\\", and this is not the tribe's totem. The tribe does have the symbol of the fish in usage under some circumstances to differentiate themselves from other Barolong, however since they are Barolong their totem or equivalent is a Kudu, which in Setswana is called Tholo. This is why Barolong affectionately refer to each other as \\"Tholo\\". History The Batlhaping tribe originates from a breakaway of the Barolong, a Tswana tribe which dates back to 1270. Barolong derives their name from their first ruler Morolong, a name which means to forge in Tswana, suggesting one who was a practitioner in the craft of a blacksmith. The Barolong were already spread widely between the headwaters of the Molopo and the Modder Rivers by the time they were ruled by their eighth king Madiboya. The rule of the ninth Barolong king Tshesebe (c. 1565 – c. 1595) witnessed the emigration of a group of clans under the sub-king (kgosana) Phuduhutswana, and their southward trek to establish themselves at Dikgatlong near the confluence of the Vaal (Noka-eTshehla or Lekwa) and the Harts (Kolong) rivers. Reasons for this exodus are unclear, but these emigrant Barolong retained their links with the capital. Famine compelled this group to break with tradition and eat fish. Since then they were known as Batlhaping. During the reign of the fourteenth Barolong king Tau, the Batlhaping refused to continue paying sehuba (tribute) to the Barolong monarch. They were thereby declaring themselves independent of the Barolong state. During their migration, the Batlhaping encounted the Korana, a nomadic Khoi tribe in 1750. The two tribes settled together at Nakoneng and established trade relations. Intermarriage between the Batlhaping and the Korana was quite common. The Batlhaping tribe continued the tradition of mining iron. They had not learned to make their own goods from iron or copper. By 1778, the Batlhaping were making annual trips to trade with the Khoi tribes on the Orange River, bringing copper, iron, knives, axes and assegais as well as tanned skins, ivory spoons and glass beads. In exchange they received cattle. A member of the first European expedition in 1801 reported that the Batlhaping received the copper beads worn by the chief were from the Barolong. Other travellers highlighted that the copper beads and rings worn by Batlhaping originated from the Damara in Nambia or the Bangwaketsi tribe in the east. The Batlhaping started making iron good themselves in 1812. In 1835, a disagreement between Maidi and his father Tawana (leader of Barolong) resulted in Maidi leading a group of Barolong away and settling what is now known as Makwasie in the North West. Maidi's people then settled in Botswana before moving to Thaba-Nchu (where they lived side- by-side with Kgosi Moroka's people). After spending time in Thaba-Nchu, they settled in Potchefstroom before moving to Manthe. The group led by Maidi joined the Balthaping and became known as the Balthaping Ba-Ga-Maidi. Batlhaping nowadays Nowadays, the Batlhaping people are found mostly in the Northern Cape and the North West of South Africa. Two of the most prominent groups from the tribe are Batlhaping Ba Ga Phuduhutswana and Balthaping Ba-Ga-Maidi. Batlhaping ba ga Phuduhutswana live mostly in Kuruman, Kimberly and Vryburg in the Northern Cape, while most Balthaping Ba-Ga-Maidi live in the Taung in the North West.

The film features many highly acclaimed Soviet/Russian actors, with Oleg Yankovsky in the starring role, as well as Lyudmila Gurchenko, Oleg Tabakov, Aleksandr Adabashyan and Oleg Menshikov in supporting roles. Plot On the eve of his fortieth birthday, Sergey Makarov (Oleg Yankovsky) is summing up his life. But nothing brings satisfaction to him, neither wife, mistress, work, or friends. At forty a person achieves many things, but previous ideals often lose their value. Sergey becomes completely confused, he is not bound to his wife with anything other than obligations, and he develops affection for a young girl named Alisa (Elena Kostina). Sergey is loved by a beautiful woman Larisa (Lyudmila Gurchenko), working with him at the drawing board, but he ignores her crush towards him. However, he uses her car, knowing that she is always willing to bail him out. Sergei's supervisor, Nikolai Pavlovich (Oleg Tabakov) loves her but without reciprocation. Alice has one boyfriend, a young guy (Oleg Menshikov), slickly wooing her. He easily wins against Sergei in arm wrestling, to which Sergei responds with shouting \\"cock- a-doodle-doo\\" under the table at his birthday party, to which all colleagues and his young sweetheart are invited. The main character of the film begins to experience a middle-age crisis; it seems that a big part of everything he wanted, is in fact, nothing more than empty vanity. Constant feeling of discomfort and dissatisfaction makes the hero rush between the people and do strange things in the hope that there will be a change in his life, that something will happen what was previously unavailable. \\"Oh, Sergei, Sergei, how jealous I was of you in college, ... but now, I regret it, everything about your life is topsy-turvy, – says Sergei's boss, Nicholai Pavlovich in a conversation in the kitchen, thus explaining Sergei's strange behavior which is evident to everyone. – Well, you are sick Sergei, do you not comprehend this?\\" Cast * Oleg Yankovsky as Sergei Makarov * Lyudmila Gurchenko as Larisa Kuzmina, Makarov's colleague and former lover * Oleg Tabakov as Nikolai Pavlovich, Makarov's boss * Lyudmila Ivanova as Nina, Makarov's colleague * Lyudmila Zorina as Natasha, Makarov's wife * Elena Kostina as Alice Suvorov, Makarov's mistress (voiced by Yelena Koreneva) * Oleg Menshikov as Sergei Sinitsyn, Alice's friend * Lybov Rudneva as Svetlana, Makarov's colleague * Aleksandr Adabashyan as sculptor (voiced by Yuri Bogatyryov) * Nikita Mikhalkov as director * Elena Mikhailova as railway points operator (E.

The role of Sergei Makarov was originally designed with him in mind. But when working on the script, director Roman Balayan saw the TV film \\"We, the Undersigned\\" starring Oleg Yankovsky and decided that he should play the main character.  Release and awards  The film was not made available until early 1983, initially being granted a very limited release, and was not widely seen until the time of Perestroika. With the film being exposed to larger audiences, it went on to gain critical acclaim. Yankovsky received the 1987 USSR State Prize for his role.

He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on Bouganville where he led an operation that destroyed three or four Japanese tanks in a CAC Boomerang fighter. The tanks were sighted by a New Zealand Vought F4U Corsair pilot which returned to Piva Airfield. Squadron Leader Palmer then led other Corsairs to the target and directed the attack. In other operations Palmer achieved a direct hit on a Japanese hut at the southern end of Bouganville Island and in February and March 1945 supported the attacks at the Battle of Tsimba Ridge. Palmer's war ended in late May 1945 when he stepped on an old American anti-personnel mine. His leg was subsequently amputated. Post-war career After two years of medical treatment, Palmer purchased Kareelah, a property at Warra in the Darling Downs. Almost 30 years later he regained his wings in the 1970s. In later life Palmer was active with the Returned and Services League of Australia and contributed to saving Toowong Memorial Park from development. Aged 91, Palmer died on 22 November 2011.

She taught from 1952 to 1991. She started as an assistant in the Astronomy Section of the Seminar on Mathematics in Barcelona, related to the Spanish National Research Council (in Spanish, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, from this point forward abbreviated to, CSIC). Later, she worked in the Henri Poincaré Institute and she also cooperated in some projects with the special chair of Technology in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. In 1970, she was the first woman to earn a science PHD in the Mathematics Section of the University of Barcelona (UB). Her thesis's name was: Contribución al estudio de la dinámica de los sistemas estelares de simetría cilíndrica (in English, Contribution to the study of the dynamics of stellar systems with cylindrical symmetry). She performed systematic monitorings of sunspots and calculations of orbits and eclipses for more than thirty years. She directed eleven degree theses and seven doctoral theses. In addition, she represented Spain in the Commission 46 on the Education of the Astronomy of the International Astronomical Union for 15 years and she worked as the scientific consultant for the Astronomy section of the Spanish version of National Geographic magazine. She retired in 1984, but she continued contact with the astronomy and university communities, attending events such as the biannual meetings of the Spanish Society of Astronomy.  Biography  = Early years = Her father, Albert Català, worked in banking, and her mother, Assumpció Poch, was a teacher who stopped working when they got married. Such situation of a woman quitting her job after marrying was typical during that time. Català i Poch was the oldest of five children: four daughters and a son. Due to Català's father's work, the family moved to Montblanc when she was a child. Poch began school there but they quickly returned, so she continued with her primary studies in Escuelas Católicas del Sagrado Corazón and María Inmaculada of Barcelona. = Higher education = When the Spanish Civil War ended, she studied Bachillerato, which is the stage of education for people over the age of 16 in Spain, at the high school Instituto Maragall. In 1947 she started studying at the UB. At that time, it was rare for a woman to study, however, her father wanted all his children to have the opportunity for education if they wanted to. In spite of the support of Català’s father, it was their uncle, Jaume Poch i Garí, who taught them the interesting facts of the universe. Poch i Garí was a professor of Geography, but he had such a passion for Astronomy that he added it as a subject in the teaching diploma study plan during the post-Spanish-Civil-war era. Poch i Garí carried their nephew and nieces to a mountain and he taught them to search the cardinal points or to figure out the time of day observing the shadow of the branches. When it got dark, he showed them the secrets of the universe, instilling Català his passion for Astronomy. Then, when she was in high school, Poch i Garí gave her astronomical and philosophical problems to solve for practice. At that time at the UB, Astronomy could only be studied in the degree of Mathematics. When Català started, only four more women were studying there, but that number actually decreased. By the time she began in the third course, she ended up as the only woman in the faculty. In 1953 she obtained the degree and continued studying to earn the PHD. Following in the family tradition, and also because of the precarious economic situation of the post-Spanish-Civil-war era, she sat for the public official exam to qualify for secondary school teaching in Mathematics. She taught from 1963 until 1975 in the high school Instituto Infanta Isabel of Barcelona. In 1971 she passed her doctoral thesis, which made her the first woman with a PH.D. in Mathematics in the UB, and she started working as professor in the Department of Astronomy of the UB. = Professional career = She started working while she attended courses that she needed to obtain the doctorate. From 1952 to 1970 she worked as an assistant of practical lessons of the subjects General Astronomy and Topography, Spherical Astronomy and Geodesy, Mathematics, Special Mathematics, Mathematics enlargement for chemists and Rational Mechanics and Topic in Celestial Mechanics in the Department of Sciences of the UB. In the academic year 1957–1958, however, the tables turned, and she took charge of the Department of Sciences of the UB. She also headed the department from 1968 to 1971. Between 1960 and 1974 she worked as associate professor in that Department and from 1965 to 1967, she was professor of Mathematics in the Department of Pharmacy. From 1971 until the beginning of the 80s, she cooperated with the Special Chair of Space Technologies in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia giving classes of Astrodynamics and Celestial Mechanics. In 1975 she started working as assistant professor in the Department of Physics of the UB after passing the public exams to become a teacher of Astronomy. Such a position made her the first woman astronomer who worked as professor at a Spanish university. Between 1982 and 1984, she worked as associate professor teaching Astronomy, Astrophysics, Geophysics and Geodesy; the last of which she taught when it was reestablished in the Department of Astronomy and Meteorology of the UB. For that reason, she scientifically cooperated with the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia. At the same time, the doctor spoke at specific seminars and specialized courses about astronomy. Furthermore, she worked in order to ensure the visibility of women in the field of astronomy, taking part in Ella es astrónoma (in English, She is astronomer), a group which aims to defend the role of women in this discipline. She also participated in Mujeres en las estrellas (in English, Women in the stars) which was a TV channel of the National University of Distance Education. As well as having been a teacher and a professor, she also held position in some important international and national organizations. For example, she has been a member of the International Astronomical Union since 1976 and, for 15 years, represented Spain in the Commission 46 of this union on the topic Education About Astronomy. Additionally, she was a member of the European Astronomical Society, the Spanish Society of Astronomy, the Catalan Society of History of Science and Technology and the Catalan Society of Mathematics. Since 1978 she also took part in the History of Science Studies Research Group and, since 1997, she was the scientific advisor of the Astronomy Section of the Spanish version of the magazine of National Geographic. Moreover, she was a member of the Astronomy Teaching Commission created by the Direcció General de Batxillerat and sponsored by the Department of Earth and Cosmological Physics of the UB in 1983. Apart from that, she wrote several books and notes as study material, for example, she wrote a book with astronomy notes which has been, and already is, used among the astronomy community. She retired in 1990. = Research career = In 1954, Català obtained a scholarship from the CSIC to investigate Spherical Astronomy through calculations and rectification of orbits of comets. Additionally, in the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), she worked on observational astronomy, calculation and rectification of orbits of comets, and daily observation of sunspots and prominences in the Observatory of the Chair of Astronomy of the UB in cooperation with the Spanish National Observatory. This collaboration had important results as the discovery of Van Allen radiation belt and the launch of the first satellite Sputnik 1. Between 1974 and 1990 she also worked on the study of stellar systems dynamics. In 1978, the possession of a Catalan grant to promote the research in the university funded her research in spherical astronomy, eclipse, occultations, and transit calculations, stellar systems dynamics and galactic dynamics. Between 1976 and 1979, she worked at the Henri Poincaré Institute because of a program of Spanish-French scientific cooperation and the University of Paris VI. On the other hand, she researched the structure of the Oort cloud at the Observatorie de Meudon. Català had also the opportunity to take part in different financed projects as the one of the European Space Agency which aimed to select and determine the stellar and planetary positions using Hipparcos satellite. Besides her research works, she also studied the Arab science and left works such as Las obras matemáticas de Maslama de Madrid (1965), Arquímedes árabe: el tratado de los círculos tangentes (1968) and Dos tratados del Arquímedes árabe: tratado de los círculos tangentes y el libro de los triángulos (1971).

The film is based on a true event involving the publicized mid-1980s bitter divorce of Linda and Robert Edelman.\\"Did Robert Edelman Plot to Kill His Wife?\\" by Sally Giddens, D Magazine, May 1988. Retrieved on August 18, 2016.  Plot  Linda Edleman is married to a wealthy and successful Dallas real estate developer Robert. Living in a beautiful home with two children, the couple seems to have it all. Unbeknownst to many, however, is that Linda is physically abused by her husband. One day, she decides she has had enough, packs her stuff and moves back in with her parents John and Virginia. Advised by her lawyer, Linda leaves the children behind in the family's home, reasoning that this way their lives will not be drastically changed. Her parents are upset with this decision, and assign her to a well-established lawyer, Ike Vanden Eykel. In order to acquire full custody, and to prevent a court case from being pursued, Robert hires a private investigator James Young, and offers him a large sum of money to kill her. A mutual friend, Fred Zabitowski brings Young in contact with the assassin, Zack. After Zack tracks her in the mall and on the highway, Linda starts to notice that she is being followed and rushes to Vanden Eykel's office for help. There, Zack reveals himself as an FBI agent in disguise. The FBI informs Linda that while they have enough evidence to put Young behind bars, they need more evidence to catch Robert. FBI agent Masterson specifically wants to wait until Robert makes the payment for the hit. Zack tries to stall the murder as long as possible, in order for the FBI to collect as much evidence as possible, but soon Young and Robert grow impatient. Therefore, the FBI decides to stage her murder, taking all her valuable belongings as 'proof', while hiding Linda in a cabin by the lake. Robert, however, grows suspicious when her body does not show up, and stalls the payment. After the FBI informs him of Linda's 'disappearance', Robert starts to take procedures to legally keep his children. This upsets Linda, who considers going back to Dallas to stop Robert, but Zack convinces her to keep low for at least one more day. After Young makes the payment to Zack, he and Robert are arrested for conspiracy to murder, and sentenced to ten years in jail.

It was the eighth named storm of the annual typhoon season. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Dianmu was first noted as a tropical disturbance, by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) during August 14, while it was located about to the south of Hong Kong, China. The disturbance was located within a narrow area of low vertical windshear and had a good outflow. Over the next day the system's low level circulation centre started to consolidate as it moved westwards, before it was classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during August 15. Over the next couple of days the system moved gradually westwards, before the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system during August 17. The depression was named Dianmu by the JMA during August 18, after it had developed into a tropical storm, while the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Depression 11W. After being named, Dianmu continued to move westwards under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure located to the north of the system and made landfall on China's Leizhou Peninsula. The system subsequently entered the Gulf of Tonkin later that day, where it developed an eye feature on microwave imagery, before it peaked with sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) as it made landfall on northern Vietnam during August 19. Over the next day Dianmu gradually weakened as it moved westwards through Vietnam, Laos and China's Yunnan province, before it degenerated into an area of low pressure over northern Myanmar during August 20. The remnant area of low pressure continued to be monitored, as it moved through parts of Myanmar and India, before it was last noted over Bangladesh. Preparations and impact =China= Dianmu passed about to the southwest of Hong Kong, China during August 17, where it generated moderate to fresh easterly winds. As Dianmu moved slowly westwards, local winds over Hong Kong strengthened during that day, before the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 was issued for both territories, by the Hong Kong Observatory and the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau. Strong winds were subsequently observed over Hong Kong, before all signals were cancelled during August 18. On Hainan Island, around 40 000 people were evacuated, ahead of the system affecting the island while transportation service were also affected. Heavy rain associated with the system caused flooding in several places over the island, including in parts of the capital Haikou. The heavy rain also brought the water level at the Longtang Dam on the Nandu River to a ten-year high of . In total, Dianmu killed 6 people, and total economic losses in Mainland China were counted to be CN¥3.18 billion (US$480.9 million). =Vietnam= Within Vietnam at least 16 people were killed, while two others were missing.

The 22 Pushup Challenge, sometimes called the 22KILL Pushup Challenge, was an activity involving pressing out twenty-two pushups to promote awareness for veteran suicide prevention along with honoring military service members and veterans. The viral awareness campaign gained traction and started to garner Hollywood celebrity support and participation in August 2016. Social media outlets like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook news feeds began to be inundated with video posts of celebrities doing their 22 pushups and then challenging other celebrities, pro athletes, politicians, etc. -- i.e. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, John Krasinski, Chris Pratt, Chris Evans, Scott Eastwood and others have posted videos of themselves completing the 22 pushups. Origin The original campaign named #22KILL was created by an OEF Marine veteran named Andrew K. Nguyen, founder of multiple veteran organizations—22KILL, HCC, White Star Families of America, and veteran.Me. The \\"Pushup Challenge\\" had first started in 2011 through the veteran nonprofit organization Honor Courage Commitment, Inc., but later continued to evolve while maintaining the foundation to honor military veterans and their service. In early 2013, the VA released a statistic that 22 veterans commit suicide every day on average which initially garnered limited media coverage. HCC's original pushup challenge collaborated with Thunder Road Film #sweat4vets to launched the \\"22 pushup\\" campaign in Oct 2013. Elements of campaign United States Navy personnel from the Naval Hospital Bremerton participating in the 22 Pushup Challenge in 2016 The introduction of the black 22KILL Honor Ring in October 2013 which the founder along with a fellow Navy veteran Nicholas Ciolino who both brainstormed together sharing their perception that veterans' honorable service and sacrifices were unrecognized. Nguyen took on a personal mission in creating a unique and universal symbol in an effort to subtly display a recognizable symbol of honor with an objective of connecting veteran advocates with each other (by noticing the ring on others in public). The originally idea was to name it \\"Black Trigg\\" in reference to the tungsten/titanium black ring designed to be worn on the index finger or trigger finger of a veteran advocate or those who supported the cause. Both veterans and non-veterans who support the cause can earn an Honor Ring by committing to pressing out 22 pushups in honor for the US Military and the veterans who've served honorably. The pushup aspect of the awareness campaign proved value in the organic growth of campaign's mission because it garnered much attention when the pushups were done in a public setting which ultimately led to people asking what the pushups were all about. This ongoing strategy combined with leveraging social media to maximize exposure ultimately led to mainstream adoption. Initial success As a rule, a supporter must press out 22 pushups to earn the privilege of wearing an Honor Ring which symbolizes a physical act of commitment to support veterans. In March 2014, Julie Hersh, President of Hersh Foundation and author of Struck By Living, learned about 22KILL and made 22 pushups wearing a skirt and boots. The video was posted on Facebook and shared in an article posted on Psychology Today around the topic of veteran suicide. Julie Hersh's son poked fun at her pushups stating that they did not count due to improper form spurred up a thread of comical comments of friends agreeing with her son's comments. This ultimately became the catalyst for the #22KILL #22PushupChallenge Campaign which Julie Hersh pledged to donate $100 for every video posted of them doing their 22 pushups for #22KILL maxed at $100,000. The campaign was a success which launched on March 28, 2014, for a week with the deadline on April 4, 2014. More than tripling the goal of 22pushup videos posted, 22KILL immediately continued the momentum by launching a follow-on goal to 22 million pushups in the same manner of posting videos of 22 pushups and challenging others. Although posts of pushup videos continued trickle in on social media after the initial surge from the Hersh campaign, Nate Koehn an Army veteran and 22KILL Veteran Advocate re-ignited the pushup campaign by garnering local news coverage in his local town, Wyoming, MI. The \\"22\\" number was part of a statistic that was originally released through a case study done by the Department of Veteran Affairs in 2012, but since then have release an updated study showing the rate had fallen to \\"20\\" veteran suicides per day. In the US, many people participated for the 22KILL nonprofit organization, and even in the UK, many people along with British troops participated in the #22KILL #22PushupChallenge. Similar to the ALS IceBucketChallenge, it encourages participants to be filmed doing 22 pushups and then nominating others to do the same. How the #22PushupChallenge was different was that requesting donations was not a primary focus which may have alleviated any stresses of financial obligation to participate. The campaign also evolved and many participants committed to doing 22 pushups for 22 consecutive days and posting the videos on various social media platforms.

The game, held shortly before the public release of Street Fighter V on February 15, 2016, famously resulted in a three-to-two win for Fiasco. The match has frequently been criticized for possibly being staged, and the celebrity's later association with professional Street Fighter play has resulted in mixed opinions among the fighting game community. Background While on tour, Lupe Fiasco released some Twitter messages regarding the Street Fighter franchise. Responding to a question on whether he ever watches the Evolution Championship Series, Fiasco said \\"Only to study Daigo...\\" When he was invited to play a match against Daigo Umehara by Mark Julio, community and sponsorship manager for Mad Catz, Fiasco responded with \\"It would be an honor to lose to Daigo-San.\\" Although the match had not been officially arranged yet, Fiasco stated shortly after with which character he was planning to play and that he was training for the match. The match was subsequently planned to take place at the Folsom Street Foundry in San Francisco during the Street Fighter V Launch Event on February 15. It was the main exhibition match and part of several pre-launch festivities, and was exclusive to the first 50 people waiting in line. The match was livestreamed on Capcom's official Twitch channel. At the event, Fiasco was gifted a Tournament Edition 2 arcade stick by Mad Catz in order to play the game on the same level as Umehara. Match Fiasco versus Umehara featured Fiasco playing as Ken and Umehara playing as Ryu. Fiasco won the first and fourth game, while Umehara beat Fiasco in the second and third. The match ended highly climactically, as both players had won two of the best-of-five games and were tied as they went into the final round. =Post-match reactions= After Fiasco landed his final KO on Umehara, neither player seemed sure of what happened; Fiasco seemed confused as to what round the game was on until he was notified that the game was over. In an interview shortly after the match, Fiasco stated that he \\"almost cried on stage,\\" noting that winning against Umehara was a bucket list thing. When asked whether he wanted to compete in future fighting game tournaments, Fiasco stated \\"I'm retiring... I'll take the win and run, I know when to get out.\\" When asked about the match by Kotaku, Daigo Umehara gave the following response: Credibility Many journalists and fans believe that the match may have been staged due to the highly climactic final and Fiasco's disregard of the idea of joining future tournaments. The match has been heavily criticized by fans as a poorly veiled marketing ploy to create more buzz for Street Fighter V. Owen S. Good of Polygon suggested that the game may have been similar to an exhibition match in tennis, players of which being \\"notorious for tanking sets to make sure the show goes the distance and the fans get their money's worth, before playing the last set on the square.\\" When asked by Kotaku if the match was staged, Alex Verrey of Umehara's sponsor Mad Catz responded with \\"No sir, it was not! Daigo would never allow such a thing.\\" Other theories for why Umehara lost exist as well, such as that he may have been suffering from the effect of a jetlag or was not able to adapt to the mechanics of Street Fighter V during the match. Legacy In the months after the match, Fiasco started forming a connection with several prominent players throughout the fighting game community, developing relationships with players who have a deep interest in the game. In May, Fiasco attended the Street Fighter V tournament Combo Breaker, apparently in order to eventually qualify for the 2016 Capcom Cup. The celebrity's continued interest in the game has produced mixed opinions among the fighting game community. However, some members of the community have suggested that the most important aspect of the Fiasco versus Umehara match was that it may help grow the community more. Fiasco later made a track titled \\"Killers\\", which was used in the hype video that took place before EVO 2016's Street Fighter V finals. The kickoff event of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour was simultaneously the launch party of Lupe Fiasco's album Drogas Light.

Kizhoor comes under the Mangalam Constituency of the Union Territory of Puducherry.http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/nri/puducherry_Delimitation.pdf Population of Kizhur in 2011 was 2,955 persons. Introduction Kizhoor has an important place in the Indian Independence Movement. French Government had conducted a Referendum in Kizhoor either to continue as a French Colonial State or to unite with the Indian nation. The French government conceded the merger of Puducherry and other French establishments through at Kizhoor. Freedom movement Pondicherry played a dual role in the history of the freedom movement. It fought for its own freedom and also gave tremendous support to India’s independence struggle against the British. The post- independence government initiated discussions to integrate the French-Indian territories with the country. The National Youth Congress began a Satyagraha. Pro-merger processions were organized by freedom fighters who were often lathi-charged, their flags seized and torn by the French-Indian police. A momentous event in Pondicherry’s freedom movement occurred on 18 October 1954Dynamics of New Panchayati Raj System in India: Select states, Ganapathi Palanithurai, Pg.No:232-233 when all elected members of the Representative Assembly and the Municipal Councils met to consider the joint proposals of the French and Indian Governments for a final settlement through a Referendum. This is known as Kizhoor Congress. Monsieur Balasubramanian, President of Assemblée Réprésentative, was the presiding officer of the congress which voted in secret ballot. An overwhelming majority of 170 out of 178 members favored the merger of French Indian territories with India. France transferred its last four territories — Pondicherry, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe — to India on 1 November 1954. M R K Nehru, General Secretary of Foreign Affairs, hoisted the Indian flag. Kewal Singh, the first High Commissioner of the new state and Pierre Landy, special diplomatic representative of the French Republic Government, exchanged signatures at the Governor’s transfer of power ceremony. It was on 16 August 1962 that, in adherence to the time tested template of the voice of the people being the voice of God, the French Government conceded the merger of Puducherry and other French establishments through De Jure Transfer. This was a direct sequel to the verdict registered at a referendum for merger of Puducherry with the Indian Union.

Robert Cathcart of Killochan died at the battle of Flodden in 1513. When the Kennedys of Cassillis and Bargany feuded the Cathcarts supported their Bargany neighbours, with John Cathcart, who built the castle, commanding the rearguard at the battle of Pennyglen. The present castle, dating from 1581, probably replaces an earlier one on the same, or a nearby, site. A wing was added in the 18th century. The castle was occupied by the Cathcart family, intermittently, until 1954. Structure Killochan castle has been described as one of the finest fortified houses in south Scotland. The castle has a five-storey main block, lying east to west, with a higher wing extending northward at the east end. In the re-entrant angle there is a square stair tower, while there is a round tower, with a corbelled-out parapet at one corner. The top of the tower is crowned by two bartizans. There is an unusually high parapet on the south side, while the eaves are unbroken by dormers. There are shot-holes in the walls, while the entrance is defended by a parapet-level machiolated projection.

It opened in 1874 and was reconstructed after the Spanish Civil War. The station provides a wide range of long- and middle-distance services, in addition to regional and suburban (cercanías) services operated by Renfe, and the narrow-gauge Renfe Feve lines. These services connect Oviedo with the other main centres of Asturias and the remainder of the Cantabrian seaboard, and with other parts of Spain including the inland plateau, the Levante and Catalonia. The station is located at the end of calle de Uría, a main commercial thoroughfare. It is adjacent to the bus station (Estación de Autobuses de Oviedo), built in 2003. Location on the rail network A number of railway lines start from or pass through the station, carrying long- and medium-distance, regional and suburban services. It is on the broad-gauge Venta de Baños–Gijón railway,Spanish rail network , Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain). providing a connection to the Madrid–Hendaye railway route. The \\"radial configuration\\" of regional services in Asturias has Oviedo station as its centre. It is also the starting point of the narrow-gauge line to Trubia, and it is on the line between Ferrol and Aranguren.Oviedo-Intermodal, Euroferroviarios.  History  The station was opened on 23 July 1874, upon the opening of the Gijón-Pola de Lena stretch of the line between Gijón and León which aimed to link Asturias with the inland plateau.Basic chronology of the narrow-gauge Spanish railways , Fundación de los Ferrocarriles Españoles. The works were commissioned by the Railway Company of Asturias, Galicia y León (Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Asturias, Galicia y León). The station was planned to handle both passengers and freight. In 1883 it was enlarged with the opening of the line to Trubia, built mainly to carry coal which was brought there by a mining railway from the mines of Quirós, Teverga and Proaza, and also to serve the armaments factory (Fábrica de Cañones) at Trubia. In 1885 the original Railway Company failed, and the station passed with its other property to the Railway Company of Northern Spain (Compañía de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de España). This company in turn was absorbed into the state-owned RENFE undertaking in 1941. The station was damaged in the Spanish Civil War and its reconstruction was planned by the architect Agustín Ballesteros.Adif saca a licitación la limpieza de la estación de tren por 700.000 euros (ADIF puts the cleaning of the train station out to tender for 700,000 euros), El Comercio, 13 October 2012. The station was re-opened by José María Fernández Ladreda on 14 October 1946. In 1998 an overhead pedestrian area was constructed above the station. Then in 1999 the FEVE services were transferred into the station upon the closure of its two other stations in the city, Jovellanos and Económicos. In 2013 the FEVE company was amalgamated with Renfe, which became the sole operator of services using the station, while Adif became responsible for all the railway plant, both broad-gauge and narrow-gauge lines.FEVE desaparece este lunes (FEVE disappears this Monday, 31 December, combining with RENFE and Adif), La Nueva España, 31 December 2012.

The two-level central canopy lies between two towers and is prolonged on both sides by two lateral wings. At ground level is a long portico made up of semicircular arches, all of the same size except for the three central arches which are somewhat larger and provide the main access to the enclosure. Despite the frontage's sober and functional appearance, the large centrally placed clock attracts the viewer's attention. While the main passenger terminal has not undergone major changes since the 1946 reconstruction, the platform area and the incoming railway tracks have since then been covered over by the imposing paved precinct, designed by Leonardo Fernández Troyano, which rests on 220 columns.La Losa: El Tesoro de Oviedo, Ayuntamiento de Oviedo This covers an area of around 38,000 sq.m. and is about 700m across. It provides access to the station itself.

Facing the old building is another sculpture, Asturias, by :es:José Noja. There are four platforms serving 13 tracks. The main platform, adjacent to the terminal area, gives access to track 2 which passes through, and to tracks 4, 6 and 8 via bay platforms to the sides.

Its capital was Kashgar,Millward 2007:23 the source of Kashgar's water being a river of the same name. Much like the neighboring people of the Kingdom of Khotan, people of Kashgar spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. Although a vassal of the Chinese Tang Dynasty from the 7th century, Shule was conquered by the Tibetan Empire in the late 8th century and was eventually incorporated into the Kara-Khanid Khanate during the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang. History The earliest mention of the Shule is around 120 BC, by Western Han Chinese when they were exploring their borders. In 127 AD Shule began to pay tribute to the Eastern Han. In 168, following Hede's murder of the current ruler (name unknown), the Han declared war on the Shule, ending in the unsuccessful Siege of Zhenzhong in 170 AD. By the end of the Eastern Han period (220 AD), Shule had conquered the city-states of Zhenzhong, Yarkent, Jieshi, Qusha, Xiye, and Yinai. In the 5th century the Shule kingdom became a tributary of the Gokturks. They gained independence from the Gokturks in 630, when the Gokturks fell in battle to the Chinese Tang Dynasty. In 632 AD it was vassalized by the Tang, as part of the Tang campaign against the oasis states.Wechsler, Howard J.; Twitchett, Dennis C. (1979). Denis C. Twitchett; John K. Fairbank, eds. The Cambridge History of China, Volume 3: Sui and T'ang China, 589–906, Part I. Cambridge University Press. pp. 225–227. . Some sources say that they were only made into a tributary and the Tang had very loose suzerainty.Whitfield 2004, p. 47.Twitchett 2000, pp. 116–118.Wechsler 1979, pp. 226–228. After being conquered by the Tang it was part of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West between c. 640 and c. 790. It was one of the stations of the Four Garrisons of Anxi between 649 and 670, after 670 one of the garrisons was changed, but Kashgar was still a seat of the four garrisons.Xue, p. 596-598. In 670 AD Shule was conquered by the Tibetan Empire. In 673 the Shule kingdom declared itself a vassal of the Tang,Wechsler 1979, p. 226. but was not reconquered by the Tang Chinese until 692 AD.Beckwith, 36, 146. It is alleged and probably untrue that Qutayba ibn Muslim in 715 attacked Kashgar. Kara Khanid Muslim Turks absorbed Kashgar during the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang. According to Mahmud al-Kashgari within Kashgar's vicinity, some non-Turkic languages like the Kanchaki and Sogdian were still used in some areas. It is believed that the Saka language group was what Kanchaki belonged to. It is believed that the Tarim Basin was linguistically Turkified before the 11th century terminated. Economy As it was on the Northern Silk Road, Shule traded mostly through the Yumen PassBonavia, Judy (2004). The Silk Road From Xi’an to Kashgar. Revised by Christoph Baumer. 2004. Odyssey Publications. and the Pamir Mountains. The capital of the Shule Kingdom, Kashgar, is marked The Northern Silk Road that passed through Kashgar split off into the northern Tarim Basin route which ran from Kashgar over Aksu, Kucha, Korla, through the Iron Gate Pass, over Karasahr, Jiaohe, Turpan, Gaochang and Kumul to Anxi.

She was the founding Director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and of its two immediate predecessors, the Physics Laboratory and the Center for Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, both for which she was the only Director. During her 22 years of management of these institutions, four of its scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 2015, the NIST Katharine Blodgett Gebbie Laboratory Building in Boulder, Colorado was named in her honor. Early life Katharine Blodgett Gebbie was born as Katharine Blodgett in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 4, 1932. She is the namesake of her aunt, Katharine Burr Blodgett (1898-1979), who was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Cambridge, and subsequently joined the research laboratories of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York. In an autobiographical memoir, Gebbie recalled that on family visits her Aunt Katharine: > always arrived with suitcases full of 'apparatus', with which she showed us > such wonders as how to make colors by dipping glass rods into thin films of > oil floating on water. She often spoke in later life of her aunt's influence by personal example on her choice of a career in science. Undergraduate education Indeed, she began on the same academic pathway as her aunt, enrolling in Bryn Mawr College in 1951, where she majored in physics. Due to the death of her father, she returned in 1954 to live with her family in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There she completed her senior undergraduate year studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Marriage At MIT she met a Scottish experimental physicist, Hugh Alastair Gebbie (1922-2005). As Katharine recalled, : \\"I guess it all began when I met a young man at MIT who for some reason or other wanted to marry me. And I thought at that time, I said, Well, no, I really have too many other things I want to do besides get married. And he said, \\"What are they?\\" And I said, Well, I'd like to live in London and I'd like to study astronomy and I'd like to get a Ph.D. And he said, Marry me and you will do all those things. And I did.\\" They married in 1957 and remained wed until Alastair's death in 2005. Graduate education After graduation from Bryn Mawr College with a B.A. in physics in 1957, Gebbie enrolled in University College London (UCL), where she earned a B.Sc. degree in astronomy in 1960 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1964. Her Ph.D. thesis, \\"A theoretical study of the atmospheres of hot stars,\\" was supervised by Prof. Michael J. Seaton, FRS, with whom she also published a study of planetary nebulae. Seaton's research group was then a notable center of theoretical atomic physics as well as astrophysics. Gebbie's training in both subjects set her on the path to her future career.  Early career  The early 1960s were a time of significant public investment in research in both atomic physics and astrophysics, due to their combined importance for understanding the upper atmosphere, plasma diagnostics, guided missile systems, and satellite and space flight. In 1962, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS; now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the University of Colorado established a cooperative research institute on the University's campus in Boulder, Colorado: the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (now JILA). \\"Laboratory astrophysics\\" is the practice of studying, in terrestrial laboratories, the basic physical processes that are important in astrophysics, and performing theoretical and computational simulation of astrophysical phenomena from fundamental physics. Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics was (and is) one of the most important branches of fundamental physics with astrophysical applications, and it was a subject particularly emphasized at JILA. According to Gebbie, : \\"the physics department [of UCL], with Mike Seaton, my supervisor, had very close relations with JILA and I think I was one of three students there who eventually came to JILA. That was the best move that I think I could have made.\\" Gebbie started at JILA in 1966 as a research associate of the University of Colorado.  Career at the National Bureau of Standards  In 1968, Gebbie was appointed to the position of Physicist at NBS, which had its own group of astrophysicists who worked in collaboration with University of Colorado colleagues at the JILA site. Other senior NBS staff at JILA who worked on astrophysics and astronomy in that era included Jeffrey L. Linsky and David G. Hummer. Gebbie worked in this capacity at JILA until 1985, except for temporary duty at NBS headquarters in Gaithersburg, Maryland during 1981-84 . Her scientific work at JILA dealt with solar and stellar spectroscopy, radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, and helioseismology. Some of her scientific papers from that period are listed below. In 1978, she was elected a JILA Fellow,JILA Fellows are the senior scientists who make up the governing body of JILA. There are 20 to 30 JILA Fellows at any given time, the number about equally split between employees of NIST and regular faculty of the University of Colorado. and served as such until 1990. While at JILA, Gebbie became friends with former NBS Director Edward Condon. She recalled him fondly in later life, and two portraits of him were mounted on the walls of her office in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Introduction to technical management  Gebbie recalled that, > Around 1980, I think it was, NIST [NBS] really decided it was focusing more > on support for industry and not astrophysics. . .I didn't see that my career > was going to thrive and I took an opportunity to come [to NBS headquarters > in Gaithersburg, Maryland] At the time, the technical activities of NBS were pursued in three laboratory- levelSuch organizations contained several hundred employees working in a broad technical area, affiliated with Divisions of tens of employees in several Groups organizations: National Measurement Laboratory, National Engineering Laboratory, and Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology. The central office of each of these units had a program and planning team that dealt with a variety of matters associated with operating a diverse national standards laboratory. There was also such a team that supported the office of the Director of NBS, called the Program Office. These teams consisted largely of bench scientists who were assigned full-time to the team for a period of one or two years. Those scientists would then return to technical units, often in line management positions. Duty in a program office was a common practice of scientists who sought to move into organizational management. Gebbie joined the program team in the National Measurement Laboratory in 1981, and spent 1982-1984 in the NBS Program Office. During this period she acquired extensive experience in NBS organizational structure, practices and culture at the executive level; broad understanding of technical programs across the NBS laboratories; and personal acquaintance with NBS senior executives. At the end of this period she was offered a line management position, and was appointed Chief of the Quantum Physics Division in 1985.The NBS/NIST Quantum Physics Division is the organizational unit with which all NBS/NIST staff at JILA are affiliated  Leadership in NBS and NIST  The mid 1980s was a period of rapid organizational change for NBS. This culminated in the passage of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 by which the National Bureau of Standards was renamed to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This transition was preceded and followed by major internal changes in NBS and NIST, in which Gebbie played key roles. Gebbie was inducted into the Senior Executive Service in 1987 and was appointed Acting Director of the Center for Basic Standards (CBS) the following year. In 1990, CBS merged with other Centers to form the Center for Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (CAMOP), with Gebbie as its Director. In 1991, CAMOP was absorbed into a new organization, the Physics Laboratory (PL), again with Gebbie as Director. Thus, during the course of six years, Gebbie had gone from a position of no managerial responsibility, to one of supervising about ten employees, and eventually to one with responsibility for several hundred employees. One issue that she encountered immediately as PL Director was the future of a free- electron laser project that had just lost its funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. She chose to terminate both the project and its performer, the NIST Radiation Source and Instrumentation Division, as well as the NIST Nuclear Physics Group. These actions were unusually decisive by the standards of NIST organizational culture, and they displaced of a number of NIST employees. However, Gebbie defended her actions effectively, stating that she believed in the full funding of top-priority programs, and would avoid responding to financial exigencies by making \\"across-the board\\" reductions. Gebbie was soon seen to be following this practice with reasonable consistency, and with a number of high-profile successes. She was also intensely active and successful in seeking recognition of PL staff by internal promotion and advancement, NIST awards and honors, and external awards. The PL line managers emulated her example. The most visible outcomes of this approach are the four Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to PL staff: * William Daniel Phillips (1997), \\"for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light\\" * Eric Allin Cornell (2001), \\"for the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates\\" * John L. Hall (2005), \\"for [his] contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique\\" * David J. Wineland (2012), \\"for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\\" These were the first, and as of 2016, remain the only Nobel Prizes awarded to the staff of NIST/NBS since its foundation in 1901.The 2011 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Dan Shechtman for a discovery he made at NBS when he was a visiting researcher. In each case, the work that was recognized was performed entirely at NIST, and virtually all of it was done under Gebbie's authority. Gebbie was intensely interested and active in promoting careers in science for women and minorities. She started the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program in PL in the early 1990s. It has since become a NIST-wide activity, bringing over 100 undergraduate students to NIST each summer. Gebbie served for many years in the Working Group on Women in Physics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. She endowed scholarships with her own funds for women graduate students in physics at the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Maryland, College Park, and was well-known within NIST and professional societies for her personal mentoring of women scientists. The honors and awards listed below reflect recognition of those aspects of her career. The Physics Laboratory had notable longevity as a NIST organization, as did Gebbie as a Laboratory Director. After some significant early restructuring, PL maintained the same general form and executive leadership for 20 years, until a global reorganization of NIST in 2011. A list of major scientific, technical and program achievements of PL is beyond the scope of the present article. Their extent is indicated in the list of honors and awards below. Three major new organizations created at NIST are due in considerable part to Gebbie's initiative. *The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), a new NIST Laboratory, was founded upon the core of the Electron Physics Group, which had previously been part of PL. Gebbie was an enthusiastic proponent of CNST and transferred significant PL resources to help establish it. *The Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), a cooperative research institute of NIST and the University of Maryland, is located on the University's College Park campus. Founded in 2006 after extensive planning and negotiation overseen by Gebbie, it has become one of the world's premiere research centers in quantum science. *The NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory  Physical Measurement Laboratory  In 2011, Gebbie was appointed Director of NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML), a new NIST laboratory resulting from a NIST-wide reorganization. Primarily a merger of PL and the NIST Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory, PML is more than twice the size of PL and has a more diverse range of programs. Its establishment involved a considerable restructuring of the PL Divisions in Gaithersburg, Maryland. However, there seems to have been no termination of employment directly attributable to the reorganization. After Gebbie's tenure at PML, she continued to be a NIST employee until her death in 2016. She remains an honored figure at NIST and in the scientific community, and a NIST building was named in her honor in December, 2015.  Death  Gebbie died on August 17, 2016 after a number of health issues following an accident in early 2015 while attending the AAAS Annual Meeting in San Jose, CA.

Since 2010, she has been Professor of Philosophy and the History of Ideas at Aarhus University. Early life, education, and marriage Jørgensen grew up on a small dairy farm in Blegind near Hørning in Jutland. While her father attended to the livestock, her mother worked as a schoolteacher. She and her siblings had a pleasant childhood, based on old-fashioned farming traditions until her father died when only 49, suffering from changes in Danish agricultural practice. She enjoyed school, especially writing essays, and dreamt of becoming an author while in the third grade at high school. After matriculating from Skanderborg Amtsgymnasium in 1978, she began studying Literature at Aarhus University, extending her interest to the History of Ideas, graduating in each in 1982 and 1983 respectively. After spending 18 months studying philosophy at the Freie Universität Berlin, in 1988 she earned an M.A. in History of Ideas with a dissertation on the German Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin: Nær og fjern: Spor af en erfaringsontologi hos Walter Benjamin, published in 1990. In 1991, Jørgensen spent a year as a visiting scholar in the English Department at Columbia University before returning to Aarhus where she received a Ph.D. in History of Ideas in 1995 with a thesis on G.W.F.

It gets its flavor from its particular manufacturing process, which involves an exact set of temperatures and fat content; as well as due to the vegetation and breed of cows found in Vologda. History The process used to create Vologda butter was invented by Nikolai Vasilievich Vereshchagin, the older brother of war artist Vasily Vereshchagin. He was inspired by tasting \\"Norman butter\\", from the Normandy region of France, at the 1867 Paris Exposition. After several years of producing the butter, Vereshchagin took his product to the 1878 Paris Exposition, where it won a gold medal. He then labelled his butter \\"Parisian butter\\", and it became known as a delicacy in both Russia and Europe. A factory to produce the butter was built in 1916. In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the factory was taken over by the state, and production decreased. Later, export of it was banned. In 1939, authorities renamed it to Vologda butter. In 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, private factories in Vologda started up to again produce Vologda butter for export. In 2010, after years of rampant counterfeiting, the Russian government declared that only butter created in the Vologda region would be allowed to be labelled as Vologda butter, creating Russia's first-ever protected designation of origin.

He was also co-designer of the first ever tandem bicycle. Arthur persuaded a number of leaders from the cycling industry to join him in setting up a fund to help people in the sector, called the Cycle Trades Benevolent Fund. Three years later, the fund was extended to include funding for the automotive industry. In 1921, the fund purchased its first building – Willoughby House in South East London. The house was initially used as an orphanage to care for children who lost their parents in the First World War. In 1939, it was closed due to the London evacuation and sold to the Salvation Army for use as a training centre.http://www.motortrader.com/general-news/happy-90th-birthday-motor- trader-from-another-90-year-old-06-06-1995 The first of Ben’s current care homes – Lynwood House in Sunninghill, Berkshire – was bought in 1947 for £16,000.

It was firstly opened under the name Majestic Hotel Inglaterra, but during the Spanish Civil War had to have its name changed... The Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona was present at an important event in the history of Catalonia and Spain known as the “Majestic Pact”. It was a political pact made in 1996 that represented an acceptance of Catalan nationalism to the rotation power of the Spanish government and the hotel was the place where this happened. The Majestic Hotel was also the place where journalists used to write about the Ebro’s Battle, the longest and bloody battle in the Spanish Civil War, in 1938, that was covered from distance by the journalists. Through the years, the hotel was also the place where many artists and public figures have chosen to stay. One of them was the poet Federico García Lorca, who in his last time in Barcelona, in 1935, stayed at the Majestic. In December of this year, intellectuals and Catalan dedicated to him a dinner because of his prestige. At the hotel, the writer Antonio Machado and León Filipe also stayed a few days in their last month's alive. They were both scaping from the march of the Civil War.

The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and the goal is to derive the best possible control to reach B in the least possible time. Zermelo Navigation with velocity \\\\mathbf vunder constant wind \\\\mathbf{w} Without considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards B. Its path then is a line segment from A to B, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path. History In his 1931 article, Ernst Zermelo formulates the following problem: Ernst Zermelo formulated and solved the general problem This is an extension of the classical optimisation problem for geodesics – minimising the length of a curve I[c] = \\\\int_a^b \\\\sqrt{1 +y'^2}\\\\, d x connecting points A and B , with the added complexity of considering some wind velocity. Although it is usually impossible to find an exact solution in most cases, the general case was solved by Zermelo himself in the form of a partial differential equation, known as Zermelo's equation, which can be numerically solved. Constant-wind case The case of constant wind is easy to solve exactly. Let \\\\mathbf d = \\\\vec{AB}, and suppose that to minimise the travel time the ship travels at a constant maximum speed V. Thus the position of the ship at time t is \\\\mathbf x = t(\\\\mathbf v + \\\\mathbf w). Let T be the time of arrival at B, so that \\\\mathbf d = T(\\\\mathbf v + \\\\mathbf w). Taking the dot product of this with \\\\mathbf w and \\\\mathbf d respectively results in \\\\vec d \\\\cdot \\\\vec w = T(\\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot \\\\vec w + \\\\mathbf w^2) and d^2 = T^2(v^2 + 2\\\\vec v \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w + \\\\mathbf w^2) . Eliminating \\\\vec v \\\\cdot \\\\vec w and writing this system as a quadratic in T results in (\\\\vec v^2 - \\\\vec w^2)T^2 + 2(\\\\mathbf d\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)T - \\\\mathbf d^2 = 0. Upon solving this, taking the positive square-root since T is positive, we obtain : \\\\begin{align} T[\\\\mathbf d] & = \\\\frac{-2(\\\\mathbf d \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{4(\\\\mathbf d \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2 + 4\\\\mathbf d^2(\\\\mathbf v^2 - \\\\mathbf w^2)}}{2(\\\\mathbf v^2 - \\\\mathbf w^2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d^2}{\\\\mathbf v^2 - \\\\vec w^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{(\\\\vec v^2 - \\\\vec w^2)^2}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w}{\\\\mathbf v^2 - \\\\mathbf w^2} \\\\end{align} Claim: This defines a metric on \\\\mathbb R^2, provided |\\\\mathbf v> |\\\\mathbf w|. =Proof= By our assumption, clearly T[\\\\mathbf d] \\\\geq 0 with equality if and only if \\\\mathbf d =0. Trivially if \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf d} = \\\\vec{BA}, we have T[\\\\mathbf d] = T[\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf d}]. It remains to show T satisfies a triangle inequality T[\\\\mathbf d_1 + \\\\mathbf d_2] \\\\leq T[\\\\mathbf d_1] + T[\\\\mathbf d_2]. Indeed, letting c^2 := \\\\mathbf v^2 - \\\\mathbf w^2, we note that this is true if and only if : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1+\\\\mathbf d_2)^2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{((\\\\vec d_1+\\\\vec d_2) \\\\cdot \\\\vec w)^2}{c^4}} - \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1 + \\\\mathbf d_2) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w}{c^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\leq {} & \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_1^2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{c^4} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w}{c^2}} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_2^2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{c^4}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w}{c^2} \\\\end{align} if and only if : \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_1\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)( \\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)}{c^4} \\\\leq \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\vec d_1^2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{c^4} \\\\right]^{1/2} \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\vec d_2^2}{c^2} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{c^4}\\\\right]^{1/2}, which is true if and only if : \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf d_1\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2)^2}{c^4} + \\\\frac{2(\\\\mathbf d_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2)(\\\\mathbf d_1\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)(\\\\mathbf d_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)}{c^6} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_1^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2^2}{c^4} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf d_1^2(\\\\mathbf d_2\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2+\\\\mathbf d_2^2(\\\\mathbf d_1\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w)^2}{c^6} Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain (\\\\mathbf d_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2)^2 \\\\leq \\\\mathbf d_1^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf d_2^2 with equality if and only if \\\\mathbf d_1 and \\\\mathbf d_2 are linearly dependent, and so the inequality is indeed true. \\\\blacksquare Note: Since this is a strict inequality if \\\\mathbf d_1 and \\\\mathbf d_2 are not linearly dependent, it immediately follows that a straight line from A to B is always a faster path than any other path made up of straight line segments. We use a limiting argument to prove this is true for any curve. General solution Consider the general example of a ship moving against a variable wind \\\\vec w(x,y). Writing this component-wise, we have the drift in the x-axis as u(x,y) and the drift in the y-axis as v(x,y). Then for a ship moving at maximum velocity V at variable heading \\\\theta, we have : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot x &= V\\\\cos \\\\theta + u(x,y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot y &= V\\\\sin\\\\theta + v(x,y) \\\\end{align} The Hamiltonian of the system is thus : H = \\\\lambda_x(V\\\\cos\\\\theta + u) + \\\\lambda_y(V\\\\sin\\\\theta + v) + 1 Using the Euler–Lagrange equation, we obtain : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot \\\\lambda_x &= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial x} = -\\\\lambda_x \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\lambda_y \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot \\\\lambda_y &= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial y} = -\\\\lambda_x \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} \\\\- \\\\lambda_y \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = V(-\\\\lambda_x \\\\sin\\\\theta + \\\\lambda_y\\\\cos\\\\theta) \\\\end{align} The last equation implies that \\\\tan\\\\theta = \\\\lambda_y / \\\\lambda_x. We note that the system is autonomous; the Hamiltonian does not depend on time t, thus H = constant, but since we are minimising time, the constant is equal to 0. Thus we can solve the simultaneous equations above to get : \\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda_x &= \\\\frac{-\\\\cos\\\\theta}{V + u\\\\cos\\\\theta + v\\\\sin\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\lambda_y &= \\\\frac{-\\\\sin\\\\theta}{V + u\\\\cos\\\\theta +v\\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\end{align} Substituting these values into our EL-equations results in the differential equation : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta}{d t} = \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} \\\\+ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right) - \\\\cos^2\\\\theta\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} This result is known as Zermelo's equation. Solving this with our system allows us to find the general optimum path. =Constant-wind revisited example= If we go back to the constant wind problem \\\\mathbf w for all time, we have : \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} = 0 so our general solution implies \\\\frac{d \\\\theta}{d t} = 0 , thus \\\\theta is constant, i.e. the optimum path is a straight line, as we had obtained before with an algebraic argument.

Her feast day is 26 August. Life Little is known about her, but by tradition she was the daughter of a minor Irish prince or Scottish king who fled to England to escape her father following persecution of her Christianity and her desire to serve God in celibacy. She sought refuge with a kinswoman who was prioress of a nunnery in Eltisley, Cambridgeshire and there became known for her holiness, though other sources suggest she lived for a time in Usselby, Lincolnshire. Following her death in around 904 she was buried near a well which bore her name, and canonized soon after. In 1344 her remains were exhumed and reburied beneath the altar of the parish church in Eltisley, which is still dedicated to 'St Pandionia and St John the Baptist'. It is rare for a parish church to retain the relics of a saint, as the much wealthier monastic institutions would usually acquire them. In 1575, in the fervour of the Protestant Reformation which sought to rid the church's association with saints, the remains of her well were destroyed by the Rector Roger Palmer amid claims that they were the site of “idolatrous and popish practices”.

His candidacy was announced in a statement on 13 July 2016, in which he declared himself to be a supporter of many of Corbyn's policies but that Corbyn did not possess the qualities necessary to win the next general election. He pledged to prevent the party from splitting and to lead Labour back into government. Smith initially faced Angela Eagle as a fellow challenger to Jeremy Corbyn, but her withdrawal from the race on 19 July 2016, resulting from Smith's stronger level of support in the Parliamentary Labour Party, left him as the sole candidate facing the incumbent.  Economic policy  Smith is anti- austerity and an opponent of the Conservative's public spending cuts since 2010. At the launch of his party leadership campaign in July 2016, he described himself as someone who is also \\"pro-prosperity\\". = British New Deal = He has proposed that £200 billion be invested to \\"rebuild Britain\\", focused on \\"building homes, renewing our transport links, schools and hospitals, as well as Sure Start centres, and care for older people\\". Smith said that doubling the number of homes built would be an important part of these plans. = Employment laws = In late July 2016, Smith said that, if elected leader of the Labour Party, he would ban zero-hour contracts and end the public sector pay freeze, saying that \\"The public sector pay freeze cannot continue while the costs – of housing and heating, transport and childcare – continue to rise\\". He said he would also reintroduce Wage Councils for hotel, shop and care workers, most of which were abolished during the 1980s and 1990s. Smith released proposals for policies aimed at improving workers rights such as a repeal of the 'Trade Unions Act' and a commitment to ensure workers' representation on remuneration committees. Smith also proposed replacing the current Department of Work and Pensions with a new 'Ministry for Labour' and a revived Department for Social Security. = Housing = In an interview with The Guardian in mid July, Smith said that housing – doubling the number of homes built – would be an important part of his platform. = Taxation = Smith has suggested that income tax rates on the highest paid should be increased, with a top rate of 50%, claiming that recent party policy had been \\"too timid\\". He has also promised to reverse cuts in Corporation Tax due to take place up until 2020 whilst reversing the cuts made to Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax in the Summer Budget.  Immigration policy  Smith has said that Labour must be overtly pro-immigration, even if it means losing votes to UKIP. He said Labour should champion the benefits of immigration such as helping economic growth and staffing public services. Previously Smith had suggested that immigration put pressure on wages.  Foreign policy  = Brexit deal referendum = On 13 July 2016, and following the vote to leave the EU three weeks previously, Smith pledged that he would press for an early general election or offer a further referendum on the final 'Brexit' deal drawn up by the new Prime Minister, were he to be elected Labour leader. He also said: \\"I don't think we should accept we're on a definite path out. I think we need to make sure people are satisfied\\". According to The Guardian, Smith is in favour of a second referendum on \\"whatever Brexit deal May's team negotiates with the other 27 EU member states\\", although a BBC report described his position as \\"Would be 'tempted' to call a second EU referendum.\\" = War Powers Act = Smith has proposed a new piece of legislation to be brought to Parliament, ensuring that any Prime Minister seeking support for military action must defend that action as a last resort.  Defence policy  = Trident renewal = When interviewed on the Today programme in July 2016, Smith revealed that he used to be a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and \\"fundamentally wants the world to be without nuclear bombs.\\" He has described himself as being a \\"sceptic\\" of the Trident nuclear programme and as favouring a multilateralist approach to nuclear disarmament (a position he noted as being Bevanite). In the weeks before the 2015 general election, he told a hustings audience that he regretted Ed Miliband's policy to renew Trident, saying: \\"would but we could get rid of it, but I fear that we can't.\\" In 2016, he stated that he would vote to renew Trident, saying: \\"I want a world without nuclear weapons altogether, but I don't think we hasten that by divesting.\\" Smith did vote in favour of the government's Trident renewal programme motion on 18 July 2016, as did another 139 Labour MPs, in line with long-standing party policy on at-sea nuclear deterrent.  Party reforms  = Gender balance = Smith pledged that he would introduce all-female shortlists in target seats at elections, as a means of achieving gender balance in the Parliamentary Labour Party. = Reintroduction of Clause IV = Smith advocated a further re-edit of 'Clause IV' which advocated the 'fight against inequality' over a return to the original Clause IV.

Specifically, these exploits and vulnerabilities targeted enterprise firewalls, antivirus software, and Microsoft products. The Shadow Brokers originally attributed the leaks to the Equation Group threat actor, who have been tied to the NSA's Tailored Access Operations unit.  Name and alias  Several news sources noted that the group's name was likely in reference to a character from the Mass Effect video game series. Matt Suiche quoted the following description of that character: \\"The Shadow Broker is an individual at the head of an expansive organization which trades in information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker appears to be highly competent at its trade: all secrets that are bought and sold never allow one customer of the Broker to gain a significant advantage, forcing the customers to continue trading information to avoid becoming disadvantaged, allowing the Broker to remain in business.\\" Leak history = First leak: \\"Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation\\" = While the exact date is unclear, reports suggest that the preparation of the leak started at least in the beginning of August, and that the initial publication occurred August 13, 2016 with a Tweet from a Twitter account \\"@shadowbrokerss\\" announcing a Pastebin page and a GitHub repository containing references and instructions for obtaining and decrypting the content of a file supposedly containing tools and exploits used by the Equation Group. Publication and speculation about authenticity The Pastebin introduces a section titled \\"Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation\\", with the following content: > Equation Group Cyber Chase Weapons Auction - Invitation \\\\- > ------------------------------------------------ !!! Attention government > sponsors of cyber warfare and those who profit from it !!!! How much you pay > for enemies cyber weapons? Not malware you find in networks.

This is good proof no? You > enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many > words. But not all, we are auction the best files. . The Pastebin includes various references for obtaining the file, named \\"EQGRP- Auction-Files.zip\\". This zip file contains seven files, two of which are the GPG-encrypted archives \\"eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg\\" and \\"eqgrp-free- file.tar.xz.gpg\\". The \\"eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg\\" archive's password was revealed in the original Pastebin to be \`theequationgroup\`. The \\"eqgrp- auction-file.tar.xz\\" archive's password was revealed in a later Medium post to be \`CrDj\\"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN\`.

The initial response to the publication was met with some skepticism, as to whether or not the content actually would be \\"...many many Equation Group cyber weapons.\\" = Second leak: \\"Message #5 - TrickOrTreat\\" = This publication, made on October 31, 2016, contains a list of servers, supposedly compromised by Equation Group as well as references to seven supposedly undisclosed tools (DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, RETICULUM, SIDETRACK AND STOCSURGEON) also used by the threat actor. = Third leak: \\"Message #6 - BLACK FRIDAY / CYBER MONDAY SALE\\" = Message #6 reads as follows: > TheShadowBrokers is trying auction.

Files as always being signed. This leak contains 60 folders named in a way to serve as reference to tools likely used by Equation Group. The leak doesn't contain executable files, but rather screenshots of the tools file structure. While the leak could be a fake, the overall cohesion between previous and future leaks and references as well as the work required to fake such a fabrication, gives credibility to the theory that the referenced tools are genuine. = Fourth leak: \\"Don't Forget Your Base\\" = On April 8, 2017, the Medium account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a new update. The post revealed the password to encrypted files released last year to be \`CrDj\\"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN\`. Those files allegedly reveal more NSA hacking tools. This posting explicitly stated that the post was partially in response to President Trump's attack against a Syrian airfield, which was also used by Russian forces. The decrypted file, eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz, contained a collection of tools primarily for compromising Linux/Unix based environments.https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP = Fifth leak: \\"Lost in Translation\\" = On April 14, 2017, the Twitter account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a tweet with a link to the Steem blockchain. Herein, a message with a link to the leak files, encrypted with the password \`Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee\`. The overall content is based around three folders: \\"oddjob\\", \\"swift\\" and \\"windows\\". The fifth leak is suggested to be the \\"...most damaging release yet\\" and CNN quoted Matthew Hickey saying, \\"This is quite possibly the most damaging thing I've seen in the last several years,\\". The leak includes, amongst other things, the tools and exploits codenamed: DANDERSPIRITZ, ODDJOB, FUZZBUNCH, DARKPULSAR, ETERNALSYNERGY, ETERNALROMANCE, ETERNALBLUE, EXPLODINGCAN and EWOKFRENZY. Some of the exploits targeting the Windows operating system, had been patched in a Microsoft Security Bulletin on March 14, 2017, one month before the leak occurred. Some speculated that Microsoft may have been tipped off about the release of the exploits.  Eternalblue  Over 200,000 machines were infected with tools from this leak within the first two weeks, and in May 2017, the major WannaCry ransomware attack used the ETERNALBLUE exploit on Server Message Block (SMB) to spread itself. The exploit was also used to help carry out the 2017 Petya cyberattack on June 27, 2017. ETERNALBLUE contains kernel shellcode to load the non- persistent DoublePulsar backdoor. This allows for the installation of the PEDDLECHEAP payload which would then be accessed by the attacker using the DanderSpritz Listening Post (LP) software. Speculations and theories on motive and identity =NSA insider threat= James Bamford along with Matt Suiche speculated that an insider, \\"possibly someone assigned to the [NSA's] highly sensitive Tailored Access Operations\\", stole the hacking tools. In October 2016, The Washington Post reported that Harold T. Martin III, a former contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton accused of stealing approximately 50 terabytes of data from the National Security Agency (NSA), was the lead suspect. The Shadow Brokers continued posting messages that were cryptographically-signed and were interviewed by media while Martin was detained. =Theory on ties to Russia= Edward Snowden stated on Twitter on August 16, 2016 that \\"circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility\\" and that the leak \\"is likely a warning that someone can prove responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server\\" summarizing that it looks like \\"somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast\\". The New York Times put the incident in the context of the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks and hacking of the Podesta emails. As US intelligence agencies were contemplating counter-attacks, the Shadow Brokers code release was to be seen as a warning: \\"Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in The Godfather where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.\\" In 2019, David Aitel, a computer scientist formerly employed by the NSA, summarized the situation with: \\"I don’t know if anybody knows other than the Russians. And we don’t even know if it’s the Russians. We don’t know at this point; anything could be true.\\" References External links * Public ledger of the auction address on blockchain.info * Various scenarios regarding who's behind The Shadow Brokers leak * List of firewall exploits contained in The Shadow Brokers leak {[Authority control}} Hacker groups Cyberwarfare Hacking in the 2010s ","title":"The Shadow Brokers"},{"id":"51358008","text":"John Hedley Lewis, DL (October 1908 – 28 December 1976) was an English landowner, farmer and local politician, who served as Chairman of Kesteven County Council and Lincolnshire County Council.

Image found in the Richmond Planet newspaper - Volume 18, Number 24, 1 June 1901.  History  Hartshorn Memorial College was created in Richmond, Virginia, in 1883 as a college for the education of African-American women. The college's namesake, Joseph C. Hartshorn donated the funds for the school in honour of his wife Rachel Hartshorn. The school was co-founded by Dr. Lyman Beecher Tefft and Carrie Victoria Dyer. Tefft became the first president while Dyer became the principal. Classes started in the basement of the Leigh Street Ebenezer Baptist Church before moving to the corner of Lombardy and Leigh Street, the former Bowe plantation, in 1884. The site is now occupied by the Maggie L. Walker Governor's School. Hartshorn was considered a sister school to the neighbouring Virginia Union University. In 1892 the school conferred three baccalaureate degrees, a first for an African-American women's college in the country. Geoffrey W. Rigler replaced Tefft as president in 1912 while Dyer became dean for two years before resigning. Hartshorn merged into Virginia Union University in 1932. The seal of the school was a map of Africa and Madagascar in front of a rising sun with the Latin inscription, \\"Sigillum colegii\\" (college seal).  Curriculum  While Hartshorn provided homemaking classes and technical training its focus was on academics. Hartshorn was known for its teacher education including a \\"model classroom\\" program similar to today's student-teaching approach to help future students gain experience in the classroom. Health and fitness was also a large part of the curriculum. The faculty was mostly women, including Dr. Lyman Beecher Tefft's daughter Mary who worked for free given the school's small budget. Only one African-American faculty member served at the school, Rosa Kinckle Jones, a graduate of Howard University and wife of Virginia Union University professor Joseph Endom Jones. She started at Hartshorn in 1888 and was a music instructor for almost 40 years.  Campus life  The students at Hartshorn were closely supervised and it had a reputation for being a strict environment. Chapel attendance was required and any sweets were banned. The students had to follow a strict dress code, were not allowed to use the streetcars, or go on dates on the weekends. The young women participated in events with the men of Virginia Union University as well as events on their own campus such as \\"Industrial Teams\\" competitions. They were encouraged to support temperance and abstain from wearing corsets.  Legacy  Shortly after merging with Virginia Union University, Hartshorn's buildings were demolished. The only physical reminder of the school is a memorial plaque on the campus of the Maggie L. Walker Governor's School Campus. The last known alumna of the school died in 2003. The records of the Hartshorn Memorial College are held at the L. Douglas Wilder Library and Learning Resource Center at Virginia Union University and include catalogs and reunion materials.

Early life  Lajos Tscheligi was born in Budapest from a family of musicians and sculptors. His father, a church painter and restorer, gave him the first painting lessons. As a boy he found colors, shapes and sounds magical and he was driven by a desire to find an answer to all the turmoil around him. His father took him to the church where he worked, and the young Tscheligi learned colors and the exposure to chalk, charcoal and paint. At the age of nine he painted his teacher and his artistic aptitude was noticed for the first time. At the age of eleven he was commissioned to draw a map of the city of Budapest, which was a great honor and earned him his first money. The family could not pay for him to study art. However, when the art professor Illés Aladár Edvi saw the portrait of the grandmother that the talented twenty year old had drawn in charcoal, he and his colleague Oskar Glatz enrolled him as a private student and taught him for four years the theoretical and basic principles of painting. The insight of the young art student that there is no art without nature was reflected in his early landscape paintings in oil and pastel. \\"In these images you can feel that the artist is a real Hungarian; he hears the sound of the water, feels the breath of the plain and all the freshness that nature brings\\", one critic wrote after Tscheligi's first exhibition in September 1943.  After Second World War  Tscheligi was in the army and was captured by the Russians and sent to a prison in that country, however he was able to escape. In 1945 back in Hungary he joined the Hungarian \\"Union of Fine Arts\\". His desire as an artist was to express his perception of light, vitality and the knowledge of the presence of soul and spirit in color and form. His subjects - people, landscapes and events showed strong vibrant expressiveness. In 1948 he presented three of his pictures at the centenary exhibition in Budapest, where his father, who he felt spiritually connected to, also showed individual works. The marriage in 1950 to Agnes Csürös and the desire for a family required a stable income. Tscheligi studied surveying and worked as a construction manager in Eger in the Bück mountains in order to earn money. However his heart and passion was painting, which he did every free minute he had.  Life outside Hungary  In 1956 Hungary was threatened with political turmoil, which culminated in the popular uprising. The young family of four fled to Switzerland and lived in an apartment in Chur. In a studio in the old town of Chur, Tscheligi taught art. In the studio/gallery in St. Moritz he found the light and the freedom to explore philosophical thoughts with the significance of the colors. The unfolding of his inner urge for the expression of much needed transparency created the first abstract works. Influenced by the struggle for survival and the quest for integration in a foreign country, this was a difficult period but very liberating for his work. At last he could paint what he felt. He dedicated himself, inspired by the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, to study his own personal painting style of metaphysical abstraction and to develop his own color philosophy. This was followed by invitations for exhibitions locally in Switzerland than France and England. In 1964/65 the family lived in the United States. But out of concern that his son would be called to serve as a soldier in the Vietnam War, the planned emigration was rejected and Tscheligi returned with his family to Switzerland. Admission as a member in Bern to the \\"Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors and Architects\\" in 1965 and the obtaining of Swiss citizenship in 1971, helped Tscheligi slowly to find his way as an artist in Switzerland and obtain greater attention. Other numerous exhibitions in Europe, USA, South America and Asia increased the circle of lovers of his art. On 13 June 2003, Lajos Tscheligi died aged ninety years old. He found his own artistic expression after an adventurous, passionate, rich and full life. He left a steadily growing group of deeply connected people, who enjoy his spiritual and emotional inspiration every day.

Liron Almog, \\"The place where i write\\", interview in Israel Hayom's Shishabbat supplement, March 18, 2013, p45 Literary works Who by fire, Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir, ed. Maya Dvash, 2011 An anthology of short stories tracing the lives of the figures comprising the tapestry of Israeli society in general, and of national-religious society in particular, set against life in the state of Israel during its founding, its formation, and up to the present-day of the second millennium. The stories are written from within present-day life, but look back to what was, and at dealing with the changes, cracks, and rifts that form and widen with time. Among other things, the book deals with couples, parent-child relationships, friendship, interaction between religious and secular people, mourning, troubled childhood experiences, relationships between old and new immigrants in the moshava, disparities in Israeli society, life in the settlements, and ideologies and their actualization. Ran Ben Nun, Yedioth Ahronoth: “Who by fire… is a surprisingly interesting anthology, first because of the author's unique style: the sentences are brief and telegraphic, the phrases are creative and unusual, and the events too come from some unfamiliar twilight land, where everything happens differently, even love stories and relationships of the sort you’d expect to find in any literary genre. Weinstock’s stories have a different flavor, which doesn’t suit every palate, but which is worth sampling, even a bit.” Ran Ben Nun, “Found Teshuvah”, Hasifriya section, Yedioth Ahronot’s 24 Hours supplement, June 6, 2011, p11 A Woman Like Her, Kineret Zmora-Bitan, ed. Tamar Bialik, 2013 Nima Zissman is a charismatic spiritual leader who returns people to religion (teshuvah). One day she suddenly disappears, leaving behind many questions, rumors, and ever- multiplying doubts. The story is told in the first person by her girlhood friend Leah, who reads her journals; while also recounting girlhood friendship as a complex relationship with its ups and downs through the years. Through the journals, Zissman’s story is uncovered and shown in a different light, revealing added layers, secrets, missed opportunities, and a double life, all of which recasts Nima’s story.

Also published in Maariv From Israel Hayom: “The protagonist's unusual story serves Weinstock as a springboard for pointedly and ironically discussing the dilemmas of the national-religious world, caught as it is between the Orthodox and secular worlds; and allows her to review its complexities and weaknesses by discussing passion – not the commonest of concepts in this particular society. The achievement of A Woman Like Her lies in presenting the dilemmas of national-religious women accessibly, in a way that highlights the differences typical of their world together with their dilemmas.” N.

Lewis met Lynn in late 1939 when he joined Bert Ambrose's eponymous orchestra and after a long courtship the couple married in August 1941. Lewis and eight other members of the Ambrose orchestra joined the RAF at the start of the Second World War, and subsequently formed a new dance orchestra, The Squadronaires. The musicians had presented themselves at RAF Uxbridge, and having signed up, went to leave as they had an engagement with Ambrose that night. The commanding officer had to immediately give them a week's emergency leave, and they arrived just before the start of the evening's show. Though the Squadronaires were one of the country's top dance bands, they were only paid five shillings a day in the RAF. The band performed all over the United Kingdom during the war and was occasionally accompanied by Lynn on vocals. Lewis worked as Lynn's manager following the war, and accompanied her on her international concerts, overseeing lighting and production of her shows. Lewis also worked as a music publisher.

In 1968 it was converted from the old railway bridge, which had been completed about the end of July 1883. The road bridge was given a Category 2 listing in 1985. Around 11,000 vehicles a day use the bridge. The bridge is the second busiest CBD route for cyclists, with 135 in peak hours in 2009 and a rising trend. To make the bridge safer for the 600 cyclists a day, sharrows are being added to the lane markings in 2019. Buses to Rototuna and route 11 cross the bridge. A new railway bridge, opened on 19 September 1964, a few metres downstream, replaced the old with a 7-span, pre-stressed concrete box girder bridge. The spans are supported by reinforced concrete piers, resting on in-situ cast piles. The bridge, built by Wilkinson and Davies Construction Co Ltd (involved in a 1959 contract law case and deregistered in 1967), is about lower than the road bridge, being above the normal river level. It was the first bridge in the country to be stressed with a 100-ton Freyssinet cable.  Old railway bridge history  New railway bridge at a lower level The bridge was designed in 1880 and the £5,519 contract let on 3 November 1881 to W. Sims. Although Sir George Grey turned the first sod of the railway extension at Claudelands in 1879, there seems to have been little publicity for that or the bridge, with only minimal mention in 1883. Ironwork for the bridge was reported as shipped in 1881. Progress was very slow, so the contract was re-let to J. R. Stone on 18 September 1882 for £4,312 13s 6d, plus the £1,376 cost (the £5,688 total would now be equivalent to just under $1m) of the four cast cylinders from A & G Price. However, work stopped in November 1882, when it was realised the foundations were inadequate, requiring bracing of the cylinders and deepening of the foundations from 3 to . The bridge was completed about the end of July 1883, but not used until the Hamilton-Morrinsville railway opened on 1 October 1884. It was originally tested with a 117-ton load. To cope with greater loads, an extra cylinder was added to the original two on each side of the main channel, the 2 new cylinders being ordered from S Luke & Co for £2,354 in 1906, and the new deck from A & T Burt Ltd for £5,872 in 1907. Further strengthening was designed in 1934 to cope with the 135-ton K-Class locomotives. There was pressure for a footbridge from before the railway was opened, A commission was appointed to investigate in 1906. With the widening and strengthening of the bridge, it was possible to build a footbridge in 1908, though there were complaints about the lack of lighting and cycling was banned. The footbridge was renewed in 1936. There was soon also pressure to remove the railway from the centre of the CBD. In 1912 the Borough Council suggested the line could be lowered. A 1938 plan was stopped by war in 1939.

Among the five dance majors, Bird found some good dancers, including Dorothy Herrmann and especially Syvilla Fort, who would go on to dance with Katherine Dunham and become an influential teacher in New York.

Cage, who also joined the faculty teaching composition, thrived in the company-oriented department, and the group produced a number of memorable works, such as Imaginary Landscape and 3 Inventories of Casey Jones.

The largest Yiddish dictionary ever to be finished was compiled by him: the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh (\\"The Treasure [Thesaurus] of the Yiddish Language\\").  Life and work  = Childhood = Nahum Stutchkoff was born Nachum Stuczko (or Nokhem Stutshko in Yiddish) into a Chassidic family living in the northeast of Congress Poland (\\"Vistula Land\\") in the then Russian Empire. Only in America did he add a vov (װ-) to his Yiddish name and two -ff to his English name.Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 14. The family moved to Warsaw in 1900, where Stutchkoff visited the traditional elementary school (cheder). He later studied at two Talmud academies (yeshivos), one in Łomża and one in Warsaw. = Theatre = At the age of 16 (in 1909), Stutchkoff had his first experience with Yiddish theatre. He broke off his traditional religious schooling to join the theatre company of the cultural organisation Hazomir (Hebrew for \\"nightingale\\"), led by the author Isaac Leib Peretz. He gave his acting debut in Sholem Aleichem's Mentshn (\\"Humans\\") and went on to act with different troupes in Poland and Russia. In 1912 he was drafted for military service. After his release he was hired by Adolf Segal and from 1917 on he played at the Undzer vinkl theatre in Kharkiv (now Ukraine), which maintained a lively theatre scene in spite of the First World War and subsequently, the Russian Civil War. In 1921 the company was incorporated in a state theatre company which led to the group's break up. Stutchkoff joined the Yiddish State Theatre of Vitebsk (now Belarus). In 1923 he emigrated to the United States – with his wife Tsilye and his son Misha, born in 1918. Stutchkoff performed on Yiddish stages in New York (1923) and Philadelphia (1924–1925) before he became the secretary of the Yiddish Drama Club in 1926. In Russia he had translated pieces for the Yiddish theatre, in America he concentrated on writing and adapting operettas, comedies, and dramas for the Yiddish stage. He worked with many illustrious names of the Yiddish theatre, such as Molly Picon, Ludwig Satz, Sholom Secunda, Joseph Rumshinsky, and Menasha Skulnik. His work usually earned him more approval from the audiences than from the critics.For this chapter see J. B.: Stutshkov, Nokhem.

Shortly after that, he started work as an announcer at WLTH, where he soon took over a children's talent show from Sholom Secunda and renamed it Feter Nokhems yidishe sho (\\"Uncle Nahum's Yiddish hour\\"). Stutchkoff quickly became popular and was hired by WEVD in 1932, a radio station which had been bought by the Yiddish newspaper Forverts (The Jewish Daily Forward) after the American Socialist Party had founded it. In the three following decades, Stutchkoff worked as a writer, director, and host of about one dozen serial programs and produced thousands of advertisements for his sponsors. His melodramatic series Ba tate-mames tish (\\"At The Family Table\\"), on family conflicts, aired every Sunday in the 1930s. The program was so popular that Stutchkoff adapted it for the stage. He also wrote many comedies for radio, such as Eni un Beni (\\"Annie and Benny\\"), In a yidisher groseri (\\"In A Jewish Grocery Store\\"), In a freylekhn vinkl (\\"In A Happy Place\\"), and An eydem af kest (\\"A Son-In-Law, living with and supported by the wife's parents\\"). One could call these comedies the sitcoms of their time. After the United States entered the Second World War in 1941, comedies of the type Stutchkoff wrote lost their popularity. He wrote the series Tsores ba laytn (\\"People's Worries\\") instead, which ended with a plea for donations to nursing homes and which ran for fifteen years. The only time he directly referred to the Holocaust was in a show called Der gehenem (\\"Hell\\") in 1943. The purpose of this show — it was funded by the Ministry of Finance – was the propagation of American war bonds. From 1948, 615 episodes of Mame-loshn (\\"Native Language\\") aired, a program dedicated to the Yiddish tongue. Stutchkoff reminded his listeners of the rich Yiddish lexicon in countless anecdotes and dramatic scenes. The show was Stutchkoff's answer to the destruction of the European Jewry – Yiddish lost his 'father and mother' in the Holocaust; American Jewry was to take in the orphan. Another purpose of the show was the promotion of his Oytser (Thesaurus; see below). Finally, in 1951 Stutchkoff started a program on family drama A velt mit veltelekh (\\"A World With Small Worlds\\"). Stutchkoff worked in radio until 1958 or 1959.For this chapter see Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 17–22, 42–46. = Lexicography = Stutchkoff gained importance as a lexicographer: in 1931 he published a Yiddish rhyming dictionary (Gramen-leksikon), and, based on it, in 1950 a thesaurus of the Yiddish language followed (Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh). A Hebrew thesaurus (Otsar ha'safah ha'ivrit) was published posthumously in 1968. The latter was outdated by the time it was published, since it was based on the educated Hebrew of the European Jews rather than the modern everyday speech of Israel.Concerning the Otsar ha'safah ha'ivrit see Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 56 sq. However, the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh, which was arranged onomastically, is undisputedly Stutchkoff's main achievement.Concerning the Oytser see Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 22–42. It remains even today the most extensive dictionary of the Yiddish language, containing approximately 90,000 single-word entries and 8,000 idioms (because of multiple designations it amounts to nearly 175,000 entries). The dictionary was meant to 'store' the Yiddish language, which was in danger of extinction after the Holocaust. Peter Mark Roget's English thesaurus served as an example; nonetheless, Stutchkoff reduced Roget's 1000 onomastic categories to 650. The dictionary received critical acclaim and 2000 copies were sold within the first year of its publication alone. It does not project purist language views; instead it includes 1500 Americanisms, 3000 Germanisms, 1000 Slavisms, 500 vulgarisms, 700 funny expressions, and 700 archaisms, dialectal words, slang words and Sovietisms. This inclusion of modern lexicon distinguished Stutchkoff's dictionary from other publications put out by the Institute for Jewish Research YIVO (Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut). Stutchkoff's decision to include those terms went against the advice of his publisher, Max Weinreich. However, some reviewers – among others Isaac Bashevis Singer – criticised the fact that Weinreich had designated certain terms as \\"not recommended\\", while others regretted that the Oytser included many artificial terms invented by the YIVO that were not in use in other circles. The Oytser's broadsheet catalogue became the basis of the Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh (\\"Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language\\"), an even more extensive dictionary. Stutchkoff planned on compiling it with the linguists Yudel Mark and Judah A. Joffe and then publishing it at YIVO. In 1955, he left the project for personal and conceptual reasons after only three years: his pragmatic approach to lexicography was not compatible with Yudel Mark's scientific claim.Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 48–55. Finally, only the first four parts of the Groyser verterbukh were published between 1961 and 1980. They covered all words starting with Aleph and most words starting with a vowel (in Yiddish orthography all words starting with /a/, /aj/, /ej/, /o/, /oj/ and /u/ are written with an Aleph). = Personal life = Stutchkoff's wife Tsilye (Celia) née Grenzer (1893–?) was also an actress and she later participated in the radio programs, as did their son Misha (1918–2003) and their daughter Esther (later married Baron, 1924–?). Misha also appeared in Yiddish movies and wrote English television programs for Hollywood, using the pseudonym Michael Morris. Stutchkoff's father is thought to have died before the Second World War, his mother and sister died in the Warsaw Ghetto. His brother Aaron was a rabbi in London. Although he grew up in a traditional Jewish-Yiddish environment in Poland, Stutchkoff abandoned this way of life as an adolescent. However, the destruction of the European Jewry by the Nazis made him an energetic supporter of traditional Judaism and an adversary of assimilation in language and religion. He became more purist and conscientious in his use of Yiddish, and recommended a Jewish upbringing for children.Mame-loshn fun Nokhem Stutshkov, redaktirt fun Leyzer Burko, mit an araynfir un an arumnemiker biblyografye fun Leyzer Burko un Miryem-Khaye Seygel, Forverts oysgabe, New York 2014, p. 46–48. Stutchkoff was very gifted in languages. He grew up speaking Yiddish, Polish and Russian, and learned Hebrew, German and French at school. His grandchildren also claim that he learned English on his passage to America with the help of William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, and the Encyclopædia Britannica.

He did much to improve social conditions in Brazil and also became rich there. He endowed numerous prizes and awards including the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prizes. The University of Edinburgh provides scholarships under the title of Gunning Victoria Jubilee Bursaries. He was a close friend of both Thomas Chalmers and Robert Christison. Life The grave of Robert Halliday Gunning, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh He was born Richard Halliday Gunnion on 12 December 1818 at Wood House in Ruthwell on the southern coast of Dumfriesshire. He was the eighth of ten children of Elizabeth Affleck McWilliam and James Gunnion. In 1822 the family moved to Kirkbean on the opposite side of the River Nith and later to New Abbey before settling in Dumfries. He was educated at the local school in Ruthwell then Dumfries Academy. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh from around 1832. From 1835 he worked on the staff of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary. In 1839, aged 20, he was licensed to practice as a surgeon by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In 1840 he went to Marischal College in Aberdeen to act as Demonstrator to Professor Allan Thomson (a demonstrator performs surgery on cadavers whilst the professor lectures). In 1841 both Thomson and Gunning went to the University of Edinburgh, Thomson to take over as Professor of Physiology, Gunning to oversee the anatomy rooms under Professor Alexander Monro. Gunning was skilled, and in one of the world's most prestigious centres for the training of doctors in the mid-19th century. His pupils included William Tennant Gairdner, William Overend Priestley and Henry Duncan Littlejohn. The University granted him his doctorate (MD) in 1846. In 1843, as a religious man, Gunning's world was rocked by the Disruption of the Church of Scotland which caused a split in the church, and in the allegiance of congregations. Gunning was an admirer of Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers who had led the split, and admired his vision of free schools, church missions etc. Gunning joined Chalmer's church in the West Port, Edinburgh rising to be a church elder. Gunning gave large sums to the church throughout his later life, including the full cost of a model lodging house attached to the church for housing the poor of the parish. In 1882 he laid the foundation stone to the replacement church on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street: The Chalmers Territorial Free Church, seating over 900 persons, and paid for almost entirely by Gunning. At this same period, also through the influence of Chalmers and Robert Christison, he persuaded the University of Edinburgh to add the requirement for the study of at least one natural science into its theology degree, the University thereafter being one of the first universities to combine these two apparently diametrically opposed fields. In this, all felt that new discoveries in a science in no way undermined religion, and indeed science should be used as a means to back religious ideologies. Gunning paid for these extra lectures at his own expense, making it hard for the University to refuse. From 1846 to 1848 he served as President of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. During this period he lived at 12 Argyll Square, close to the University,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1846-7 and following his marriage in 1847 he moved to a larger house at 43 George Square. Following in the footsteps of Robert Mortimer Glover, the more recognised James Young Simpson, and the overtly practical Francis Brodie Imlach, Gunning undertook experiments on the use and safety of chloroform during 1847/8. Gunning was firmly in the Glover camp: that chloroform was too dangerous for use on humans for full anaesthesia (Imlach used only partial anaesthesia, for dental extractions, perhaps the most logical use). In May 1848 he presented his findings to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh and was critical of Simpson's advocacy of human use. Simpson (there present) defended his beliefs. However, public opinion, including a knighthood for Simpson and widespread media coverage, dominated the feelings of the general public. Medical truth was therefore suppressed and the use of chloroform spread widely, much to the delight of Dr James Duncan of Duncan & Flockhart of Edinburgh, who held the British licence for production. Gunning's experiments confirmed those of Glover (who had already left Britain in his disgust of Simpson's plagiarism of his own work, Simpson being the official reader of Glover's university thesis on the subject). Gunning also established that Simpson had undertaken no systematic experimentation whatsoever. Gunning equally became disillusioned at his own profession. As a combination of these factors, and apparent health problems, he and his new wife left Britain and emigrated to Brazil for a different life. He kept in regular written contact with his friend Robert Christison, and sent him supplies of Ipecacuanha from Brazil, this being the basis of a drug used to treat dysentery. The two hatched a scheme to grow the plant in India to treat many cases there without need for such transport distances. Gunning set up home, and a medical practice, in Rio de Janeiro. He also began investing in various ventures including gold mines and creating a railway system across Brazil (mainly on the coast-line). He also created the first street-car (tram) system in Rio. In 1872 he moved to Palmeiras to be closer to his mining interests. Here he was visited by notable persons such as Louis Agassiz who sought (and gained) funding for his projects. Gunning's investments proved lucrative. His already great wealth grew. Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil created him a Grand Dignitary of the Empire of Brazil and awarded him the Order of the Rose, for his work in improving the lives of the poor of Brazil. Dom Pedro wrote to Queen Victoria asking that this be recognised in Britain and this was agreed. He was afterwards entitled to the title \\"His Excellency Robert Gunning\\". His wife died in 1877 and is buried in Edinburgh. He returned to Britain in 1882 as a millionaire. In 1882 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Alison, John Hutton Balfour, Rev John Duns, Andrew Douglas Maclagan and Sir William Turner. He donated a large sum to the Society to fund the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize. He went blind around 1890. He died at 12 Addison Crescent in Kensington, London on 22 March 1900. His body was taken to Edinburgh for burial in the Grange Cemetery with his first wife, Eliza, following a memorial service at West Port Church. The grave is in the south-east corner against the eastern boundary wall. Family He was married twice: firstly in 1847 to Eliza Meikle (died 1877) of Springfield House, Govan; secondly, in old age in 1890, to Lady Mary Agnes Winwood Hughes, 30 years his junior. She was the daughter of Sir William Smith, 3rd Baronet and widow of Sir Thomas Collingwood Hughes, 8th Baronet. He had no children by either marriage.

These are often erroneously assumed to be founded by the persons after whom they are named, but all are founded by Gunning: *The Alison Prize for Community Medicine (named after William Alison) *The Bell Prize for Physiology (named after the brothers Charles and John Bell) *The Joseph Black Prize for Chemistry (named after Joseph Black) *The Christison Prize for Pharmacology (named after his best friend Robert Christison) *The Edward Forbes Prize for Zoology (named after Edward Forbes) *The Gregory Prize for the Practice of Physic (Medicine) (named after James Gregory) *The Hutton Balfour Prize for Botany (named after John Hutton Balfour) *The Lister Prize for Surgery (named after Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister) *The Maclagan Prize for Forensic Medicine (named after Andrew Douglas Maclagan) *The Monro Prize for Anatomy (named after his mentor and friend Dr Alexander Monro) *The Thomson Prize for Pathology (named after his mentor Prof James Thomson) *The Simpson Prize for Obstetrics (named after James Young Simpson)... this latter prize clearly has an irony given his conflict with Simpson, it perhaps was intended to convey (within the closed medical world) that he saw Simpson's contribution as extending no further than the field of Obstetrics. *The Cullen Victoria Jubilee Prize (a very large bursary named after Prof William Cullen) Other Philanthropic Works Gunning paid for various works in St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh including the plaque to Jenny Geddes in 1886 and the magnificent faux-medieval tomb to the Marquess of Argyll (erected 1895). In 1886, Gunning paid for the bulk of the cost of the Covenanters Memorial at Deerness.

Also discussed was Iran-Iraq war, which was then in its seventh and final year, and the formation of local committees in every Arab country. Upon returning to Doha, several Qatari businessmen had decided to establish the Qatari Popular Committee to Support the Palestinian Intifada. Among them was Khalid bin Mohammed al Rabban. Rabban, born in Doha in 1942, is a British educated businessman who now owns multiple corporations and deals primarily in trading. The committee began its fundraising activities in 1988 and continued uninterrupted for six years, until the Qatar National Bank ordered their account to be shut down. The committee raised millions of riyals from private donations as well as monthly contributions from its members, which included over 70 wealthy Qatari businessmen.

The idea for this club initially emerged in 1952, when Khalifa Khalid Al Suwaidi, Mubarak Saeed Ali, and Saleh Mohammed al- Sulaiti, Khalifa Al-Kuwari, Hamad al-Hamidi, Ahmed Abdullah al-Khal, Abdul Latif al-Jaber, Khalid al-Raban, Ahmed al- Marfiat, and a number of their friends, inspired by the success of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the revolutionary tide at the time, would meet frequently for discussions of that nature. Though they claimed themselves to be a cultural club, the group acted more as a political club or party. In 1958, the group decided to collect monthly contributions in order to secure a meeting location for the club. Among these initial donors, was club member, Khalid bin Mohammed al-Rabban, currently the Deputy Chairman of Al-Raban Holding Group and the chairman and managing director of Qatar Primary Materials Company (QPMC). In 1959, the group decided that they wanted to create an official club of young Muslims and extended membership to classmates and colleagues in order to create a space for social and religious dialogue between members. That same year the club was founded after the members drafted a statute for the club, created a provision of material resources and contributions, and created a focus for membership development using a preliminary list of names for potential candidates from the Arab Bank. In 1960, the club struggled to find a meeting place, but was able to create a board of directors, as voted upon by the general assembly. The board consisted of Khalifa Al-Kuwari as president, Khalid al-Raban as vice president, Mohammed Youssef al-Ali as secretary, Mubarak Rashid al-Hitmi as treasurer, Ahmed Abdullah al-Khal as secretary of cultural activity, Nasser Ahmed the second as secretary of social activity, and Ahmed Abdullah al-Maliki as a sitting board member. The club’s mission statement was centered on ethics, work and dedication with the goal of raising cultural level and social awareness among youth. The club stated in its document of statues that it would interfere in religious and political matters. Club activity was focused on the club magazine, which was published monthly, trips throughout Qatar to visit cultural landmarks, lectures, debates, poetry readings, and the club theater on topics or issues of choice. Most controversial of these was the theater and the poetry readings. After putting on a provocative political play written by Saleh Mohammed al-Sulaiti, portraying the Arabs in Palestine in a violent struggle, authorities took notice of the clubs movements that inspired the use of violence. The club also published a photo of a missile. The final straw for authorities came shortly after the club put on a debate between Ahmed al-Tager and Hassan Ali Abdullah Youssef in late 1960 regarding the political struggle between nationalists and leftists in Iraq during the reign of Abd al-Karim Qasim. In 1961, tanks raided the club after Friday prayers, and members were taken to prison. Members were placed in isolation and were restricted from receiving any visitors in prison. Among those arrested were Khalid bin Mohammad al-Rabban, Mohammed al-Ali, and Khalifa Al-Kuwari. They spent 21 days in prison, and decided to go on a hunger strike. After the intervention of a few relatives of the members, they were released from prison. Some members who were imprisoned referred to those who assisted in their release as servants of God.

The coup was staged by an indigenous Liberian faction of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) under the command of Master Sergeant Samuel Doe. Following a period of transition Doe ruled the country throughout the 1980s until his murder on 9 September 1990 during the First Liberian Civil War. Background Historians have argued that a series of complex events led to the coup of 1980. The first of which was the imbalance of power between the native population of Liberia and the Americo-Liberians. The Americo-Liberians were descended from African- American settlers, some of whom were freed slaves and their descendants who emigrated to Liberia with assistance from the American Colonization Society (ACS). The Americo-Liberian settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered and following Liberian Declaration of Independence they held an elite position over society while native tribes lived within poorly developed rural communities. Prior to the coup, a majority of Liberian presidents were of Americo-Liberian descent and belonged to the True Whig Party (TWP), and while opposition parties were never banned, the TWP effectively governed the country as a one-party state. Although Liberia saw a period of economic prosperity in the 1960s and rapid development, there was still disparity between the Americo-Liberians and the natives. After coming to power in 1971, William Tolbert sought to address imbalances and introduce liberal reforms including recognizing opposition groups. However, Tolbert was also accused of using nepotism and corruption to retain power which fueled opposition the government. Tolbert's administration also introduced unpopular agricultural reforms which were opposed by many sections of Liberian society and led to riots in 1979. Following the riots and the Maryland ritual killings, Tolbert called for the imprisonment of opposition leaders. Events Doe (center) holding a walkie-talkie, alongside the other conspirators during the 1980 coup. In the early hours of April 12, 1980, 17 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and soldiers of the AFL led by Master Sergeant Samuel Doe launched a violent coup d'état. All of the conspirators were indigenous Liberians, while Tolbert belonged to Americo-Liberians. The group entered the Executive Mansion (presidential palace) and killed Tolbert, whose body was dumped into a mass grave together with 27 other victims of the coup. It is reported that Harrison Pennoh was the person that killed Tolbert. Later, a crowd of angry Liberians gathered to shout insults and throw rocks at the bodies. Aftermath By the end of April, most of the cabinet members of the Tolbert administration had been put on trial in a kangaroo court and sentenced to death. Thirteen of them were publicly executed by firing squad on 22 April at a beach near the Barclay Training Center in Monrovia.

The marriage lasted seven years and produced two children Patricia, and Frankie Jr., but ended in divorce on June 5, 1935.\\"Frankie Klick, Boxer Divorced\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 8, 5 June 1935 On May 18, 1932, Klick tried unsuccessfully to take the USA California State Lightweight Title, but was defeated by Young Peter Jackson in a ten-round points decision at the Golden Gate Arena in San Francisco California. Taking the World Jr. Lightweight Championship against Kid Chocolate Before a crowd of 4,000, Klick took the World Jr. Lightweight boxing champion against Kid Chocolate, on December 25, 1933 at the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a seventh-round technical knockout. The Ludington Daily News, wrote \\"The flashy Cuban \\"bon bon\\" (Chocolate) was bereft of the title in the seventh round of a scheduled fifteen round Christmas Day bout by a whistling right smash to the chin and all he got in exchange was the second knockout of his career although the latest was of the technical variety.\\" The bout had been fairly close until the seventh with Chocolate showing stamina and style.\\"Young Frankie Klick Holds Junior Lightweight Title\\", Ludington Daily News, Ludington, Michigan, pg. 6, 26 December 1933 The seventh round had gone two minutes and fifty-eight seconds when the knockout occurred. \\"The Cuban waged a fast, aggressive fight in the early rounds that gave him a temporary lead.\\" Chocolate had landed rights \\"to the head and body,\\" but may have lacked the stamina to stay with Klick. Chocolate may have been suffering from a knockout he had received from Tony Canzoneri only a month previously. He retained his featherweight championship at least in the state of New York.\\"Frankie Klick Takes Junior Lightweight Crown\\", Belvidere Daily Republican, Belvidere, Illinois, pg. 6, 26 December 1933 Boxing after taking the Jr. Lightweight Title On October 28, 1933, he lost to Tony Canzoneri at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn in a ten-round Unanimous Decision. It was the first of four meetings the two would have, and Klick would fail to win a decision in all four. Nonetheless, the capacity Brooklyn crowd of 5000 hailed Klick and booed when he lost the decision. On January 22, 1934, Klick lost a ten-round points decision to Frankie Wallace, a Cleveland native, at Public Hall in Cleveland, Ohio.\\"Frankie Wallace Given Decision over Frankie Klick\\", The Burlington Free Press, Burlington, Vermont, pg. 9, 23 January 1934 =First bout with champion Barney Ross= Champion Barney Ross On March 5, 1934, Klick met Barney Ross, defending his Jr. Welterweight Title before a capacity crowd of 10,000, in a ten-round draw at Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Klick's quick punching in the last two rounds earned him the draw according to the referee Toby Irwin. The Associated Press gave Ross five rounds, Klick four, and one even. Ross, in his typically lightning fast style, may have landed twice as many punches, but many ringside believed Klick's punches carried more authority. According to the Santa Cruz Evening News, \\"Klick's swift rallys in the last two rounds earned him the decision of the referee.\\"\\"Ross Extended to Earn Draw With Frankie Klick\\", Santa Cruz Evening News, Santa Cruz, California, pg.8, 6 March 1934 The draw was impressive for Klick, as Ross had won all his bouts in the previous three years, never having been held to a draw.Jr. Welterweight Title was at stake in \\"Barney Ross, Frankie Klick Battle\\", The Salt Lake Tribune Salt Lake City, Utah, pg. 14, 6 March 1934Ross had not been held to a draw in three years in \\"New York Boxing Body is in Favor\\", The Ogden Standard Examiner, Ogden, Utah, pg. 11, 10 April 1934 =Vacating the World Jr. Lightweight Title= Klick vacated the World Jr. Lightweight Title in 1934, most likely as a result of being unable to maintain a weight under 130 pounds, the limit for the Jr. Lightweight division. =Losing to champion Tony Canzoneri= On June 28, 1934, Tony Canzoneri defeated Klick in a ninth-round technical knockout when referee Patsy Haley stopped the bout at Ebbets field in Brooklyn. Haley, former lightweight boxer, would become one of the best known and trusted New York referees in history. Klick may have won the first two rounds but by the third Canzoneri had battered Klick with a strong right to the jaw, and began piling up points in the following rounds, landing a hard blow to the eye of Klick in the fifth which contributed to Haley's decision to end the bout four rounds later. The winner of the bout would be matched with Barney Ross for the World Lightweight Crown.\\"Tony Canzoneri Knocks On Ross's Door\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 39, 29 June 1934 On July 31, 1934, Klick lost a disputed ten round points decision to Italian boxer Cleto Locatelli at Shibe Park, in Philadelphia. A significant crowd of 15,000 voiced their disapproval of the decision, and Ray Carlin, Klick's manager wrote a letter of protest indicating Klick had clearly won six of the ten rounds.Ward, Allen, \\"The Neutral Corner\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 13, 2 August 1934 On October 2, 1934, Klick defeated Harry Dublinksky in an important ten round split decision at New York's Madison Square Garden. Klick would face Canzoneri two more times, on June 10, 1935 in Washington D.C., and in a non-title fight on August 19, 1935 at Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. He would lose both of the well attended fights, the first in a close twelve round Split Decision by referee Jack Dempsey, and the second in a ten-round points decision. Their first bout was a great tribute to the staying power of Klick, who manaaged to match one of the greatest fighters of the era at Griffith Stadium in Washington D.C. before a crowd of 20,000. The bout was not a title fight. A hard right to the face of Klick, may have been the turning point in the judging, and at least one source felt that Canzoneri had done the heavier punching in the close bout.Klick gave good fight, and was of Polish origin in \\"Klick Gives Champ Tough Ring Battle\\", Wilkes-Barre Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 14, 11 June 1935 Many fans protested the decision as the judges split their votes, and Dempsey, more a boxing celebrity than an experienced referee, was required to make the call as to who had won the fight.\\"Klick, Tony, to Click for Scribes\\", Reno Gazette Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 13, 2 August 1935 Klick's decline in the fourth and last Canzoneri bout Their second meeting on August 19, 1935 was described as a \\"dull bout\\" by the Oakland Tribune. Noting a decline in his fighting style, the Tribune, wrote, \\"the Klick of last evening was a tentative, uncertain chap, who depended almost entirely on a left jab, who missed more punches than could be expected of a world's champion.\\" Canzoneri managed to outpunch Klick for nearly the entire bout.\\"Klick Loses to Champion Fourth Time\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, 20 August 1935, pg. 23 Canzoneri was noted as having an advantage in every round but the seventh.\\"Canzoneri Forces Out Forth Victory Over Frankie Klick\\", The Decatur Daily News, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 27, 20 August 1935 Canzoneri was easily one of the greatest, and fastest boxers of the era, and hardly an easy target. Both boxers had fought over one hundred bouts, a telling number, and both were nearing thirty, which may have been a factor in their lack of snap and stamina. =Second bout with Barney Ross= On January 28, 1935 Barney Ross retained his Jr. Welterweight crown in a title bout against Klick before a crowd of 13,000 at Municipal Stadium in Miami, Florida. Ross's Lightweight Title was not at stake. Ross scored the only knockdown of the fight, with a blow to the chin of Klick in the second round. With Ross showing greater confidence and technique, the Associated Press gave him eight of the ten rounds, though he received a hard right from Klick in the sixth round.Mickelson, Paul, \\"Easy Winner Over Frankie Klick in Ten Fast Rounds\\", Oshkosh Daily Northwestern, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, pp. 13, 29 January 1935 On November 22, 1935, Klick defeated Al Roth in a ten-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. Klick was still hoping for a Lightweight Title fight with Canzoneri, though one never materialized.\\"Game Ralley Staged by Frankie Klick\\", Logansport Pharoah Tribune, Logansport, Indiana, pg. 2, 23 November 1935 =Loss to Lou Ambers= On January 3, 1936, Klick lost to important lightweight contender Lou Ambers in a ten-round Unanimous Decision at Madison Square Garden. The winner of the bout was to earn a World Lightweight Title match with Tony Canzoneri. The Associated Press gave eight round to Ambers and only one to Klick with one even. Only 8,236 fans turned out to see what the Arizona Republic considered a \\"tame\\" fight.\\"Frankie Klick Whips Lou Ambers in Tame Bout\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 12, 4 January 1936 On June 9, 1936, Klick lost to Puerto Rican fighter Pedro Montanez in a ten-round points decision. According to one source, Klick was on the \\"verge of being knocked out three times in the ten round affair.\\"\\"Montanez Turns Back Frankie Klick\\", Green Bay Press-Gazette, Green Bay, Wisconsin, pg. 19, 9 June 1936 On May 4, 1937, Klick lost to the great Henry Armstrong in a fourth-round technical knockout at Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Armstrong, along with Barney Ross, would become one of the few triple World Champions in boxing history. Klick ended his career with two bouts against Al Citrino at National Hall in San Francisco in February and April 1943, drawing in eight rounds in the first, and losing in eight in the second. Klick lived a relatively long life for a boxer who had fought so many champions and over one hundred fights. He died on May 18, 1982 at the age of 75.

Ray angrily removes her from the dance floor and after a short fight she storms out to take the car home. In the parking lot she is choked to death with a hose then left on the ground with her legs spread apart. The papers report that the \\"Spread-Eagle Killer\\" has struck a fourth time and Ray is brought in as a suspect for questioning, during which he is treated roughly by an overly suspicious Sergeant Thomas Mackey. The extremely intuitive Dr. Sally Powers, a specialist in criminal psychopathology, is brought in to give insight into the mind of the killer. Mackey is allowed to forego a ten-day suspension and to continue to work on the case if he agrees to supervise Dr. Powers. At the scene of the next murder Dr. Powers writhes on the floor in the tape outline of the victim and announces that the victim was raped. That night in bed Dr. Powers relives a murder she survived as a child. The next morning, she is called in to the station to meet with the captain but instead has a hunch that leads her to a health club. She emulates the behavior of the instructors in order to take over a class when the next body is found in another room in the club. After an argument with Mackey she predicts the location of the next murder to be a biker bar. Mackey follows her and finds her in a back room with a knife in her hand next to a freshly murdered woman. The victim was not stabbed, though, but rather beaten with a blunt object. Mackey apologizes to her at a diner, where he witnesses her emulate the behavior of their waitress. She begins to think like the killer and Mackey encourages this but she becomes scared and runs away. The commissioner explains to Mackey that Dr. Powers is the survivor of an attack by a man who killed her family. She survived by hiding in a closet but now jumps into the personalities of others to escape her own tortured mind. Dr. Powers plots the murders on a map in the shape of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and determines that the killer is piecing together a perfect woman. She tracks the killer down but is led to the edge of a rooftop for a final showdown between her, the killer, and Mackey. The killer tries to murder them both, but ends up falling from the roof to his death.

Biography Born in Larissa on 1 January 1879, he enlisted in the Hellenic Army as a volunteer in 1901, after finishing school. He then entered the NCO School and was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant of Infantry in 1909. He was a fellow student of Nikolaos Plastiras, who became a close friend. He participated in the Goudi pronunciamiento of the same year. In the First Balkan War of 1912–13 he served as a staff officer in the 4th Infantry Regiment and in the Metsovo Brigade in the Army of Epirus. He participated in the Second Balkan War as a company commander in the 4th Regiment, and fought in the battles of Kilkis and Kresna Gorge. As an ardent follower of Eleftherios Venizelos, during the First World War and the National Schism he joined the Provisional Government of National Defence and fought in the Macedonian front in 1916–18. His crowning moment was the victory at the Battle of Skra in May 1918, where he participated as chief of staff of the Archipelago Division. For his service he was promoted from Major to Lt. Colonel. In 1919 Protosyngelos participated in the unsuccessful Allied intervention in the Ukraine, before going to serve in the staff of the Army of Asia Minor, where he was among the planners of the Greek summer offensive of 1920, which led to the capture of Prussa. He was then placed in command of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (later renamed as the 48th Regiment), a post he held until the defeat and collapse of the Greek front in August 1922. In the subsequent retreat to the coast of Asia Minor, he was able to successfully evacuate his unit to Lesbos. Protosyngelos was among the leaders of the 11 September 1922 Revolution, and became one of the twelve members of the Revolutionary Committee. He served as Minister for Public Order in 1924, Inspector-General of Infantry (1926), Commander of the 2nd Infantry Division (1926–28) and of the Athens Garrison (1929), before becoming Director-General of the Ministry of Military Affairs (1930–34), Deputy Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff (1934–35), and finally Commander of the Supreme War School (1935–36). He was discharged from service on 16 July 1936 with the rank of Lt. General. An opponent of the subsequent dictatorial 4th of August Regime of General Ioannis Metaxas, Protosyngelos joined the Secret Revolutionary Organization (MEO), which aimed to overthrow the regime. Protosyngelos was married, but died childless at his home in Athens on 15 December 1943, during the Axis occupation of Greece.
