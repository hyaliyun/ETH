Carter's fourth film stars Jonathan Ralston and Jennifer Dale, and was screened at many international film festivals, winning three awards. Synopsis An intruder attacks a woman, Evelyn (Jennifer Dale), and her husband, Jack (Jonathan Ralston), fails to intervene. After shooting the intruder, Evelyn forces Jack to answer for his cowardice and in so doing, realizes exactly what has robbed her life of meaning and love. She must face painful, but ultimately liberating, truths about the marriage and herself. Cast *Jonathan Ralston as Jack *Jennifer Dale as Evelyn *J.D. Smith as the Intruder Production In 2008, the Canadian Film Centre in Toronto invited University of Winnipeg film and theatre professor and filmmaker Shelagh Carter to participate in an exclusive workshop intensive (the Directors Lab, Short Dramatic Film programme) to develop film projects along with a handful of other Canadian professionals; her project was chosen for development by the Centre with $250,000 in production support. With the additional support of the University of Winnipeg, Carter completed the 35mm short film in time to be released by the summer of 2009. Cinematographer Ousama Rawi took a short break from his regular work on The Tudors to shoot One Night, in his first collaboration with the CFC: > I was pleased to have the opportunity to work on a CFC project and give back > to a community that has given me so much...

They have since worked together on additional projects, including two of her feature films. Shortly after the production was finished, Shelagh Carter and lead Jennifer Dale determined that they had a similar style of working, and would enjoy working together again on something more substantive. They developed the concept for what would become Carter's third feature film, Into Invisible Light, which was released in 2018.

It had as its goal the exploration of the North American coast between the mouths of the Mackenzie and Coppermine rivers and the Bering Strait, in what is now present- day Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. Franklin was accompanied by George Back and John Richardson, both of whom he had previously collaborated with during the disastrous Coppermine expedition of 1819–1821. Unlike Franklin's previous expedition, this one was largely successful, and resulted in the mapping of more than of new coastline between the Kent Peninsula and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, an area that until then had remained largely unexplored by Europeans.  Background  The Northwest Passage, a supposed sea route to the Pacific Ocean by way of the Arctic Ocean, had long been sought by European explorers as a possible trade route to East Asia and the Indies. During the Age of Exploration, the presupposed existence of the passage motivated much of European exploration in North America. Beginning in the early 19th century, the Royal Navy, having expanded to unprecedented proportions during the Napoleonic Wars, turned much of its attention to the passage's discovery. Under the influence of Sir John Barrow, the Royal Navy sponsored many Arctic expeditions, including those led by John Ross, William Edward Parry, James Clark Ross, and John Franklin. For the next fifty years, the Royal Navy dominated the Arctic seas. Map showing British Arctic exploration up until the year 1828 Franklin himself was at that point an experienced mariner, serving in the Royal Navy while in his teens, and having been present during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In 1819, he was chosen to lead an expedition whose intention was to map the northern coast of the North American continent eastwards from the mouth of the Coppermine River. The Coppermine expedition was by any objective standard a disaster; Franklin completely failed in his goal of mapping a sufficient portion of the Arctic coast, and half of his 22-strong party died over the course of the journey. In spite of the expedition's disappointing results, upon his return to Britain, Franklin was lauded as a hero and promoted post-captain in 1822. In the following year he began planning another expedition to the Arctic, with the intention of, this time, using the Mackenzie River as the expedition's primary route of travel. Franklin himself devised the expedition's itinerary; it was accepted by the Admiralty in autumn, 1823. In accordance with his official instructions, he was to first spend the summer of 1825 travelling to Great Bear Lake via standard trading routes, where the party's winter quarters would have been constructed. Beginning in spring of 1826, Franklin was to descend the Mackenzie River to its mouth, where he would then split the party. A smaller detachment, led by Richardson, was to map the intermediate coast between the Mackenzie and Coppermine Rivers. Franklin himself was to travel westwards along the coast with the ultimate goal of reaching Icy Cape, the northern terminus of the Bering Sea. From there, Franklin would have the choice of either rendezvousing with under the command of Frederick William Beechey or returning to the party's winter quarters at Great Bear Lake. Should he rendezvous with Beechey, Franklin would be conveyed either to the Sandwich Islands (now the Hawaiian Islands) or Canton, whereupon he would make his own way back to England.  Preparations  A York boat similar to the vessels used during the expedition In spite of the poor outcome of his previous expedition, Franklin had learned several key lessons that would lead to the future success of the Mackenzie River expedition. In Franklin's mind, the weak point of the Coppermine expedition was its dependency on outside help. His preparations were not completed sufficiently in advance, and he relied far too much on fur traders, voyageurs, and First Nations People, all of whom were far less forthcoming than anticipated. Applying this knowledge to his new expedition, Franklin sought to place greater trust in British naval personnel and, most critically, to bring sufficient supplies for the duration of the journey. The recent union of the North West Company and Hudson Bay Company, and resulting cessation of the companies' near-constant state of conflict also meant that any anticipated assistance would be much more likely to materialize. Supplies were ferried from York Factory to the continent's interior beginning in 1824. While still in Britain, Franklin oversaw the construction of the company's vessels. Although canoes of birch-bark were the de facto standard for travel along North America's internal waterways, Franklin judged them unfit for navigation in the open waters of the Arctic Ocean. He therefore commissioned the construction of three boats built of ash and mahogany, the largest of which was in length and was capable of carrying of baggage. Navigation instruments included a sextant, altimeters and a telescope. Supplies included tobacco, alcohol, tents, books, paper, fishing implements, blankets, clothing, guns, knives and hatchets; much of the company's supplies were intended to be traded with the local First Nations communities.  Events of the expedition   Departure and first season  Franklin and the other naval officers, including Back and Richardson, departed Liverpool on 16 February 1825. Landing in New York City on 15 March, they then followed standard travelling routes through New York State, across the Niagara River and Lake Ontario, then through Upper Canada to Fort William on the shores of Lake Superior. After traversing numerous lakes and river systems, the party arrived at Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan River on 15 June. From there, they reached Methye Portage, mostly by way of the Churchill River system. Simultaneously, most of the expedition's supplies were sent from York Factory on Hudson Bay up the Hayes River, reaching the officers at Methye Portage on 29 June. The party descended the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers, arriving at Fort Chipewyan on 15 July. The party's expeditious pace can be attributed to their intense rowing efforts: during their last push to Great Slave Lake, they had been paddling for thirty-six of the thirty-nine preceding hours. At Fort Resolution, Franklin met with Keskarrah and Humpy of the Coppermine Indians, the latter of whom was the brother of Franklin's friend and former ally Akaitcho. After coasting the southern shore of Great Slave Lake, the party reached the headwaters of the Mackenzie River on 3 August, which would thereafter be their route to the Arctic Ocean. Near the headwaters of the Mackenzie River The party began their descent of the Mackenzie, reaching its junction with the \\"River of the Mountains\\" (likely the Liard River) on 4 August. Fort Norman was reached on 7 August, with the group having traveled in three days. At Fort Norman, realizing that their speedy pace afforded them additional time for exploration, Franklin opted to embark on a preliminary reconnaissance to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, while the rest of the party would continue to Great Bear Lake to oversee the construction of their winter quarters. The goal of this venture was primarily to find the best route to the sea, in addition to establishing friendly relations with the native Inuit. Joined by Admiralty Mate E.N. Kendall and an Inuit interpreter, Franklin departed on 8 August. During their descent they encountered several groups of First Nations, some of whom joined them for a portion of the journey. The delta of the Mackenzie was reached on 13 August, whereafter the party began exploring the archipelago of islands surrounding the river's mouth. Most of their early navigation of the sea was plagued by intense fog that occluded astronomical observation. After completing their early charting, the group returned to the Mackenzie River proper, reaching Fort Franklin (modern day Délı̨nę) on Great Bear Lake on 5 September. Over the course of the 1825 season the party had traveled .  Winter  The winter of 1825–1826 was relatively uneventful. On 8 September, Franklin dispatched two men to Great Slave Lake to convey an account of the expedition's progress and to pick up letters sent from the Crown. Supplies were provided by the Chipewyan and Dog-Rib Indians. With October came the first frosts and snow; it was at this time, just before ice began to form on the lake, that fishing was most productive. According to Franklin, several hundred fish were caught daily, most of which were frozen until the following spring. Délı̨nę in the Northwest Territories, built on the site of Fort Franklin Those at Fort Franklin were frequently visited by the local First Nations. On one such occasion, on 18 December, the wife of one of the Dog-Rib hunters brought her young girl to the fort, seeking advice on the girl's sickly condition. In spite of the Europeans' efforts, the girl perished, bringing great grief to the mother. The First Nations and Europeans celebrated Christmas together on 25 December. On 1 January, the coldest temperature of the season, , was recorded. The month of February brought anxiety to the party as their fishing output greatly decreased. The group's dried meat had since been expended, and the scant diet of fish caused several among the them to suffer from diarrhea. As recorded in Franklin's journal, during the winter of 1825–1826, to pass the time, the men played a game very similar to modern ice hockey. In a separate entry, Franklin noted that \\"skating\\" was among the winter \\"amusements\\" enjoyed by his men. Whether or not the use of ice skates were combined with the game is not known; if the two were combined, this would make Fort Franklin (Délı̨nę) the earliest documented location where ice hockey was played, and also the first known use of the word \\"hockey\\" in reference to the modern-day sport. The ice on Great Bear Lake began breaking up on 23 May, but with this came the constant threat of mosquitoes, which Franklin called \\"vigorous and tormenting\\". As winter ended, the party made a more concentrated effort to chart the coastline of Great Bear Lake. The most extensive of these explorations was conducted by Richardson and Kendall, lasting from 10 April–1 May. Franklin at this point grew displeased with the constant presence of the Dog-Rib Indians, claiming that they \\"continued hanging about the fort, and their daily drumming and singing over the sick, the squalling of the children, and bawling of the men and women, proved no small annoyance.\\" With the beginning of June, Franklin began more intensely planning the party's voyage to the coast. The boats the company had been constructing over the course of the winter were tested on 15 June. Supplies and men were then divided between the western and eastern detachment, and after final preparations were made, the party departed from Fort Franklin on the summer solstice of 1826.  Spring and the parties split  The expedition's plans for the coming summer were ambitious. Franklin, leading the western detachment, aimed to get as far as Icy Cape, which had previously been visited by James Cook in 1778. Richardson's journey would involve coasting the shore of the ocean as far east as the mouth of the Coppermine River. He would then ascend the river and cross overland to Great Bear Lake, ideally arriving at Fort Franklin before the onset of winter. The delta of the Mackenzie River The party made quick progress in descending the Mackenzie River, reaching its delta by early July. The western detachment was to consist of two boats, Lion and Reliance, commanded by Franklin and Back, respectively. The eastern detachment consisted of the boats Dolphin and Union. In the early morning of 4 July, the parties split.  Western detachment  The western detachment quickly faced difficulty at the hands of the Inuit. When the boats became grounded due to the river's shallowness, Franklin, while observing the location's longitude, discovered a nearby Inuit settlement. After instructing Back and the others to be prepared to take up arms should the Inuit prove hostile, Franklin departed for the camp, alongside the party's interpreter, Augustus. The settlement, which contained in excess of 250 individuals, initially greeted the expeditionaries with hesitance. When Franklin later explained the benefit to their people of the putative sea route known as the Northwest Passage, they became friendly. Soon after, however, the Inuit, desiring the party's cargo, plundered Lion and Reliance. After an altercation lasting several hours, the two boats departed; Franklin commanded that none of the Inuit follow them under penalty of being shot. He later designated the area where the conflict had occurred as Pillage Point. George Back's illustration of the collision For the rest of the season, much of the group's voyage was impeded by poor weather and sea ice. On 9 July, the group once again came in contact with the Inuit; this encounter was much more cordial. Franklin inquired as to the usual date of ice breakup and the groups exchanged gifts. According to Franklin, the Inuit group, who numbered 48, had a high proportion of elders, all of whom were highly active and appeared in excellent health. Nearly all suffered from some degree of snowblindness. When told of the Europeans' previous encounter, the Inuit condemned the attack. On 15 July, the mouth of the Babbage River was reached; soon after, Herschel Island came into view. On 17 July, the party stepped foot on the island, where they came into contact with more Inuit. Western travel along the Arctic coast was arduous: temperatures seldom exceeded , and gusts of wind frequently upended the expeditionaries' tents, making sheltering from the rain difficult. The constant fog obscured visibility, and the mosquitoes were described by Franklin as \\"torturous\\". At one point, Augustus fell into a fit of hypothermia after rushing into an icy lake in pursuit of a reindeer. He was given blankets and chocolate to warm up, but by the next morning still felt pain in his limbs. By 30 July, the party had entered the waters of the modern-day state of Alaska; Brownlow Point was reached on 5 August. In the succeeding weeks, Franklin grew hesitant to continue pursuing the expedition's goal of reaching Icy Cape. On 16 August, realizing that summer was coming to an end and the navigability of the rest of the party's route would be threatened by increasingly poor conditions, Franklin decided they would turn back towards the Mackenzie's mouth. Unbeknownst to him however, an exploratory party of Beechey's vessel lay only to the west, which, under the party's average pace, could have been reached in less than a week. According to Franklin, had he known that Beechey's vessel was a mere six days' pursuit away, \\"no difficulties, dangers, or discouraging circumstances, should have prevailed\\" on him to convene with Beechey. He was, however, oblivious to Beechey's proximity, and opted to return to the Mackenzie. The journey east was relatively uneventful, but sea ice and wind continued to pose a serious threat to the expeditionaries. The party landed on Herschel Island again on 26 August. Encounters with Inuit occurred almost daily; on 29 August, Franklin was informed by a group of Inuit that Richardson's party had been seen clearing the Mackenzie River delta and had narrowly escaped another attempt by the Inuit to pillage their boats. He was later alarmed by a group of Inuit who rushed into the party's camp and informed them that a rival Inuit group was en route with the express intent of massacring the party and stealing their possessions. This group, termed the 'Mountain Indians' by Franklin, allegedly had planned to await their likely return to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Under the pretense of helping the Europeans navigate the river, the Mountain Indians would then stave in their boats, making them unfit for escape to deeper waters; then a larger group would rush out of a predesignated hiding spot and attack. Franklin was cautioned by the Inuit to thenceforth only camp on islands that were out of gunshot range. He later surmised that the Mountain Indians had been armed by trades conducted with the Russians, who were ostensibly prohibited from trading with any Inuit groups. Sea ice frequently detained Lion and Reliance By September, the party was ascending the Mackenzie River, and on 4 September had reached Point Separation, where the two detachments had originally split. They recovered a small depot of supplies, stowed by the party the previous July, before pressing on. The mouth of the Great Bear River was reached on 16 September; five days later, Fort Franklin was reached. Over the course of their journey, the western party had traveled a total distance of in 80 days, with an average distance of about per day.  Eastern detachment  Consisting of twelve individuals, the eastern detachment proceeded down the Mackenzie, and eventually to open ocean. Encounters with the Inuit were relatively amicable, with the task of interpretation given to the group's Inuit companion, Ooligbuck. Dolphin under the threat of sea ice After traversing the maze of islands that comprise the delta of the Mackenzie, open sea was reached on 7 July. That same day, a band of Inuit were encountered. Quelling their initial fears by presenting gifts, Richardson established relations with the group, but found their disposition impolite. Ooligbuck, apparently distrusting the band, urged Richardson to depart; upon doing so, the party was trailed by the Inuit. These encounters remained almost constant until 20 July, when the last group of Inuit were seen before the party reached the Coppermine. The following days were spent rounding the highly indented coastline; progress was impeded by the constant presence of sea ice. On 4 August, a large northerly landmass came into view, which Richardson termed Wollaston Land. In reality, this land was actually a southerly protuberance of Victoria Island, one of the largest islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. This was the first time a European had laid eyes on the island. Coronation Gulf was reached on 6 August, whereupon the group turned southwards until they reached the mouth of the Coppermine. It was at this point that Richardson crossed into territory already mapped during Franklin's previous expedition. Cross-section of an Inuit dwelling as interpreted by Richardson. The central square has a side length of The party reached the mouth of the Coppermine River on 8 August, and the next day began ascending the river. The river was at that point running extremely low, occasionally to the point that it hindered the travel of their boats. After passing Bloody Falls, Richardson judged that the rest of the Coppermine's course was unfit for navigation by boat. He therefore decided that Dolphin and Union would be left behind and the group would carry on by foot. Each man was allotted of pemmican, in addition to packages of macaroni, dry soup mix, chocolate, sugar, and tea. In addition, the group carried a portable boat; blankets; spare guns, shoes, and ammunition; fishing nets; kettles; and hatchets. When divided among the party, this load came to a weight of per man. Richardson feared that carrying so much weight would prove too arduous, and assured the men that when sufficient progress was made they would halt and examine the necessity of carrying certain items. All that was not carried by the party was stowed in tents marked with a Union Jack for the use of a future expeditionary force. The march to Great Bear Lake began on 10 August. Richardson planned to follow the Coppermine as far as its junction with the Copper Mountains. From there they would hike in more or less a straight line until reaching the Dease River, which they would then descend to its mouth at Great Bear Lake. Many among the party were unaccustomed to carrying such heavy loads, but upon examining the group's stocks, Richardson found little that he considered superfluous enough to discard. He eventually resolved to abandon the portable boat and five of the group's rifles, reducing each man's load by . Still, the group seldom traveled at a pace of more than . Bloody Falls on the Coppermine River In spite of their reduced loads, many among the party were exhausted by the end of each day. Richardson attributed much of their exertion to the frequent change of elevation and the spongy, wet ground and resulting absence of secure footing. The party grew more accommodated to their loads in the succeeding days and soon established a more productive pace. In the night of 15 August the party encountered a group of First Nations who led them to the headwaters of the Dease River. Soon after, a range of hills distinct to the north shore of Great Bear Lake came into view, and the lake itself was spotted on 18 August. From that point onward, Richardson was to wait for a scout from Fort Franklin who had been directed to depart from the fort on 6 August to the mouth of the Dease River and wait there for Richardson's party. After sending out hunting excursions to enlarge the expedition larder in preparation for their push to Fort Franklin, on 21 August, Richardson and the scouting party were united. After paddling along the coast of Great Bear Lake, Fort Franklin was reached on 1 September, nearly two weeks before the western detachment. The eastern detachment had traveled over the course of 60 days, amounting to an average of per day. A total of of new coastline had been charted over the course of the journey.  Second winter and departure  During the party's absence from Fort Franklin, those still inhabiting the dwelling were directed to make repairs, which were completed by the time Franklin arrived. Upon his arrival, however, Franklin became concerned at the depletion of the fort's food stores, and dispatched Kendall to requisition some food and other supplies from Fort Norman. Kendall returned to the fort on 8 October, carrying an abundance of food and other supplies, which were of particular benefit to the eastern detachment, who had been forced to sacrifice much of their equipment during their overland crossing between the Coppermine and Dease Rivers. The party's second winter offered few events of note. By mid-November, ice on the Great Bear Lake rendered it unnavigable. By early January, temperatures dipped to , and by February, to . The fort's larder at that point consisted of some tens of thousands of fish and nearly of meat. Franklin endeavored to depart from the fort much earlier than in the previous season. He quit the fort on 20 February, carrying most of his supplies, including all of the expedition's charts, journals, and drawings, on a sledge, while Back was to remain at the fort until the breakup of the ice, after which he would proceed to York Factory and thence to England on an HBC ship. Franklin and his company traveled southwards through the taiga, arriving at Fort Chipewyan on 12 April and then Cumberland House on 18 June. It was there that Franklin and Augustus were to split, with the latter shedding tears at their parting and requesting to be informed of any other expedition to the Arctic that he could join. They reached New York in August, and on 1 September Franklin departed from North America on a packet ship bound for Liverpool, which he reached on 26 September, while Back and the other officers arrived in Britain in October. Franklin's second expedition had thereafter concluded.  Aftermath  Upon his returned to Britain, Franklin was lauded as a hero. In 1829 he was knighted by George IV, and later appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight of the Greek Order of the Redeemer. Although Back had been appointed commander in 1825, following his return to Britain, he was unable to find appointment to a ship, and was unemployed until 1833. Franklin's map of the discoveries under the expedition Over the course of the expedition, Franklin and his associates had traveled nearly and mapped half of the continent's northern coast. This was a sharp contrast to Franklin's previous expedition, where only had been explored before the party was forced to turn back. Franklin himself later wrote of the contrast between this expedition and his previous one. During the breaking of the party at Point Separation, he realized the contrast between his situation and the previous expedition, writing that \\"it was impossible not to be struck with the difference between our present complete state of equipment and that on which we had embarked on our former disastrous voyage. Instead of a frail bark canoe, and a scanty supply of food, we were now about to commence the sea voyage in excellent boats, stored with three months' provision.\\" Franklin was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land in 1837, leaving this post after six years. Given that less than of Arctic coastline remained unmapped, Franklin, then 59 years old, was appointed to lead another expedition in 1845. The Northwest Passage expedition departed England in 1845 aboard the ships and . In the autumn of 1846, the vessels became icebound somewhere in Victoria Strait, and Franklin and all 128 of his men were lost. During the Admiralty's inquest of Franklin's lost expedition, of which Back was a member, several search parties were dispatched, all of which were ultimately unsuccessful. The wrecks of Erebus and Terror were found off King William Island in 2014 and 2016, respectively.  Preceding discoveries  Mackenzie's route from Montreal to the Arctic Ocean Prior to Franklin's second expedition, the mouth of the Mackenzie River had only been seen on one occasion by Europeans. In 1789, Scottish explorer Alexander Mackenzie descended the river, hoping that it would lead to the Pacific Ocean. Under the employ of the North West Company, Mackenzie spent the summer of 1789 descending the river and reached its mouth on 14 July. In Mackenzie's mind, having reached the wrong ocean, he turned back in disappointment and returned to Britain, where his efforts were not widely recognized. Mackenzie later led the first overland crossing of North America, reaching the western coast of British Columbia in 1793. In 1771 Samuel Hearne crossed overland from Hudson Bay, reaching the source of the Coppermine River in July. He descended the river down to Coronation Gulf, marking the first time a European had reached the Arctic Ocean by land. During his third voyage, James Cook mapped much of the western coast of North America, including Alaska's eponymous Cook Inlet. He reached Icy Cape, the ultimate goal of Franklin's western detachment, in August 1778. It was named by Cook for the large amounts of ice along the cape's coast.

J.K. McAllister is native of Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland and eventually migrated to the colonies through joining the British Legion during the American Revolutionary War. He served as a captain under the command of General Banastre Tarleton.U.S. and Canada, Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s-1900s [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc, 2010. During the route of Tarleton's forces, McAllister was captured at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781. He was paroled after the war and remained in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, where he married Mary Elizabeth Smith, and became a citizen of America. He entered the mercantile business in Charleston, South Carolina and then moved his family to Greene County, Georgia, where Harriet was born April 17, 1798. Four children were born to the family: Thomas Keith; Augustus William, Harriet Bryon, and Charlotte. In 1810, McAllister moved his family to the old town of Washington, Mississippi, near Natchez, Mississippi.County Historical Society, Chapter 9, SOME WASHINGTON COUNTY GENEALOGY, pg. 339, Note: Washington Co., MS Blantonia and Greenville left William Whitaker Blanton married Harriet Byron McAllister in Walnut Hills, Mississippi on March 26, 1818. This was a time when the region was being established as a United States territory through the selling of lands by the Choctaw; during December 1817, Mississippi had been admitted as the 20th state in the union. Washington County, Mississippi was established in January 1827, and the couple settled there in 1828 where they obtained a plantation through land grants under Andrew Jackson’s administration. William and Harriet eventually had 10 children but only two survived (Orville Martin Blanton and William Campbell Blanton). The town of Greenville, Mississippi (named for General Nathaniel Greene of the American Revolutionary War) was established in 1846 as the third seat of government in Washington County. The community has shifted location twice, and present day Greenville is located slightly southwest of the first settlement. The original town site fell victim to flood waters of the Mississippi River. right Their plantation (Blantonia) was located on and around the current city of Greenville, Mississippi (the third town of Greenville). This plantation is not to be confused with the plantation of the same name in Lorman, Mississippi, also named Blantonia but owned within the same families. William Whitaker Blanton's parents John Blanton and Martha Belton \\"Patsy\\" Whitaker, originally from Virginia, moved to Kentucky but eventually the family established the Blantonia Plantation, near Red Lick/Lorman, Mississippi, just south of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Just before the start of the Civil War, Washington County’s population was 15,679, with 14,467 of those residents enslaved to plantations such Blantonia.Mississippi encyclopedia, University of Mississippi After William Whitaker Blanton's death in 1838, Harriet Byron McAllister Blanton married Samuel Theobald on June 27, 1841. McAllister outlived her second husband as Theobald died in 1866; they also had two children together but both did not survive. In total, she was the mother of 12 children, 10 by William and two by Samuel with only two that would survive. The destruction of Greenville Greenville, Mississippi was a pivotal town for General Ulysses S. Grant's northern operations in Mississippi during the Siege of Vicksburg campaign. Beginning at the end of March 1863, Greenville was the target of General Frederick Steele's C.S.A. soldiers. The design of this operation was to do reconnaissance of Deer Creek as a possible route to Vicksburg and to create havoc, cause damage to confederate soldiers, guerrillas and loyal (Confederate) landowners. Highly successful, Steele's men seized almost 1,000 head of livestock (horses, mules, and cattle) and burned 500,000 bushels of corn during their foray.\\"War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies\\" (O.R.) Series I, Vol XXIV, Pt I, p 502. In addition to the damage done, the Union soldiers also acquired several hundred slaves, who became U.S. soldiers. The first black regiments were formed during the Siege of Greenville; by the end of the operation, nearly 500 ex-slaves were learning the \\"school of the soldier.\\" In early May 1863, as retaliation for Confederate artillery firing on Union shipping on the Mississippi River, Commander Selfridge of the U.S. Navy ordered ashore 67 marines and 30 sailors, landing near Chicot Island. Their orders were to \\"put to the torch\\" all homes and buildings of those citizens guilty of aiding and abetting Confederate forces. By the end of May 9, the large and imposing mansions, barns, stables, cotton gins, overseer dwellings and slave quarters of Harriet Blanton's (Blantonia) and another plantations were completely destroyed. The destruction of Greenville was completed when a number of Union infantrymen slipped ashore from their boats and burned every building in the town but two (a house and a church).\\"War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies\\" (O.R.)

Following that destruction of Greenville, Mississippi by Federal Troops on September 1, 1865, Harriet Theobald and her two sons Orville and William donated 47.5 acres of the Blantonia Plantation to rebuild Greenville, earning her the nickname “Mother of Greenville.” In 1867, Major Richard O’Hea, who had planned the wartime defense fortifications at Vicksburg], was hired to lay out the new town; Theobald Street serves as the eastern boundary. The citizens erected a courthouse, a public school, and a library, and provided spaces for churches. Greenville was incorporated on June 24,1870. By this time, the burned-out site of old Greenville was crumbling into the Mississippi River. The Blanton/Theobalds also sold off other portions of land for home owners.Lakeport Planation - Greenville,. 1873 — Weatherbee purchases land from Mrs. Blanton Theobald, where he built his home. left Later life Harriet Theobald survived through other hardships the city of Greenville faced. In 1874, the citizens of Greenville suffered a city-wide catastrophe: the Great Fire of 1874, which destroyed 45 homes and 62 businesses, reducing the population of 890 to about 500. A second major fire hit the city a year later. Despite warnings of fire hazards, wood had been used as the major material for the construction for the post-Civil War Greenville.Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities - Greenville, Mississippi In 1877, a Yellow fever outbreak decimated the community and surrounding areas that stretched to Memphis, Tennessee. A third of the population died in Greenville, including the mayor and four of five councilmen. Soon after the city was chartered in 1886, a group of cotton planters, factors, buyers, and merchants organized a cotton exchange. Due to the fertile soil, cotton farming and processing became a huge boon to the economy and growth of Greenville during and after Harriet Theobold's lifetime in that city. While in Monteagle, Tennessee in 1886 (aged 88) Harriet Byron McAllister tripped over a croquet wicket and fell suffering a fractured hip.

Likelihoodist statistics is a more minor school than the main approaches of Bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics, but has some adherents and applications. The central idea of likelihoodism is the likelihood principle: data are interpreted as evidence, and the strength of the evidence is measured by the likelihood function. Beyond this, there are significant differences within likelihood approaches: \\"orthodox\\" likelihoodists consider data only as evidence, and do not use it as the basis of statistical inference, while others make inferences based on likelihood, but without using Bayesian inference or frequentist inference. Likelihoodism is thus criticized for either not providing a basis for belief or action (if it fails to make inferences), or not satisfying the requirements of these other schools. The likelihood function is also used in Bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics, but they differ in how it is used. Some likelihoodists consider their use of likelihood as an alternative to other approaches, while others consider it complementary and compatible with other approaches; see .  Relation with other theories   Criticism   History  Likelihoodism as a distinct school dates to , which gives a systematic treatment of statistics, based on likelihood. This built on significant earlier work; see for a contemporary review. While comparing ratios of probabilities dates to early statistics and probability, notably Bayesian inference as developed by Pierre- Simon Laplace from the late 1700s, likelihood as a distinct concept is due to Ronald Fisher in . Likelihood played an important role in Fisher's statistics, but he developed and used many non-likelihood frequentist techniques as well. His late writings, notably , emphasize likelihood more strongly, and can be considered an precursor to a systematic theory of likelihoodism. The likelihood principle was proposed in 1962 by several authors, notably , , and , and followed by the law of likelihood in ; these laid the foundation for likelihoodism. See for early history. While Edwards's version of likelihoodism considered likelihood as only evidence, which was followed by , others proposed inference based only on likelihood, notably as extensions of maximum likelihood estimation.

Gretel Adorno was the individual who wrote the following death notice in the Frankfurter Rundschau: “Theodor W. Adorno, born on 11 September 1903, died quietly in his sleep on 6 August 1969.” Detlev Claussen. Theodor Adorno: One Last Genius. Trans. Rodney Livingstone.

Adorno: A Biography. Translated by Rodney Livingstone. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2005.  Friendship with Walter Benjamin  Notably, she became close friends with the German Jewish philosopher, essayist, and cultural critic Walter Benjamin, whom their mutual acquaintance Siegfried Kracauer would later that year introduce to her then suitor, Theodor Adorno; at this point, 1923, Adorno was at that time still a university student at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. Karplus' only sibling, Liselotte, became the second wife of Benjamin's cousin, Egon Wissing who was a doctor. Stefan Müller-Doohm. Adorno: A Biography. Translated by Rodney Livingstone. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2005. Gretel herself was in frequent contact with Wissing both before and after the Adornos wed in 1937 and soon after emigrated to the U.S. The letters between Gretel Adorno and Benjamin suggest that their friendship was not only personal, but also professional. She often assisted him by critiquing drafts of his work, including his large project, Passagenarbeit (The Arcades Project). This work had led to professional tensions between Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, due to the former's concerns over Bertolt Brecht's increasing influence over Benjamin's thinking, which Adorno believed betrayed his waning commitment to negative theology. Gretel Adorno wrote personally to Benjamin in 1934 regarding her \\"great reservations\\" towards Brecht's \\"often palpable lack of clarity,\\" advising Benjamin to be cautious in that intellectual friendship.Gretel Adorno and Walter Benjamin. Correspondence, 1930-1940. Henry Lonitz and Christoph Gödde, Eds. Trans. Wieland Hoban. Cambridge UK and Malden MA: Polity, 2008.

Once her investment in the partially family-owned leather factory Karplus & Herzberger was liquidated in 1933, Karplus became the junior partner and partial owner of the firm Georg Tengler, which manufactured leather gloves and was situated in Berlin. When the senior partner, Tengler, died in 1934, Karplus became responsible for the factory and its more than 200 employees until she determined to liquidate the company in December 1936 for unknown reasons (Boeckmann suggests that this may have been because the relevant state records and Chamber of Commerce archives were partially destroyed in the war years).

Career within the Frankfurt School  Stenography  Dialectic of Enlightenment Gretel Adorno assisted her husband Adorno and his intellectual partner Max Horkheimer in developing the manuscript for Dialectic of Enlightenment.

Gretel remarkably was able to take down what Martin Jay describes as a \\"highly abstract conversation developing at breakneck speed\\".Martin Jay. “Review: Towards a New Manifesto by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer,” Notre Dame Philosophical Review 2 (37),2012.  Secretarial work  Her assistance in recording and editing the verbal and written drafts of Dialectic of Enlightenment was neither the first nor the last time she worked alongside Adorno and Horkheimer in their intellectual activities. From 1937, the year that Gretel married Adorno, she assisted on almost all initial drafts of Adorno's works, which were dictated to her and taken down in shorthand.Stefan Müller-Doohm. Adorno: A Biography. Translated by Rodney Livingstone. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2005. Gretel was involved in all of her husband's intellectual endeavours. Whilst the couple were living in the United States during World War II, Adorno for the most part refused to write in English, which meant that Gretel was required to translate his works into English.Lisa Yun Lee. “The Bared Breasts Incident.” 114-139. In Feminist Interpretations of Theodor Adorno, Renée Heberle, Ed. University Park, Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Pres, 2006.  Editing Aesthetic Theory  When Theodor Adorno died suddenly in 1969 without having finalised the manuscript of Aesthetic Theory, Gretel Adorno and Adorno's former student Rolf Tiedemann took up the task of bringing that document to completion and publication. They discuss in the Editor's Afterword how \\"Adorno’s metaphor for works of art applies literally to the last philosophical text on which he worked:  Health issues  For much of her life, Gretel Adorno suffered from acute chronic health issues that doctors were unable to accurately diagnose; they are frequently mentioned in both her letters to Benjamin, and Adorno's letters to his parents.Theodor Adorno.

Their first EP, the six-track grape., was released on 23 February 2014. It is described as psychedelic surf-rock, and draws comparison to the music of the Beach Boys. Professor Caveman's second EP, Vol. 2, was released on 5 December 2014, and features \\"latin bossa nova undertones and a more prominent punk-rock influence, creating a mélange of genres that work together harmoniously.\\" By 2014, Professor Caveman became popular in New Brunswick's basement scene, and they played at the college radio station, 90.3 The Core's 2014 musical festival Corefest.The Deli calls their third album, Vol. 3, \\"a super intriguing and borderline bizarre EP,\\" adding that \\"the luscious, crisp guitar chords[,] melt, blend, and evolve into something else entirely; cryptic and fuzzy vocals mumble barely articulate lyrics with a South American flavor, wallowing into ever-changing bass lines and drum beats, all accompanied by a horn section.\\" Sniffling Indie Kids In 2017, Professor Caveman signed with Sniffling Indie Kids, and released the four- track EP Vol. 3, on 19 May 2017. They performed at the North Jersey Indie Rock Festival on 6 October 2018. Their fourth EP, the five-song Vol. 4, was released on 20 April 2018. It is described as psychedelic funk and draws comparison to the music of Ariel Pink and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Bob Makin of The Aquarian Weekly says that \\"the jams 'n' grooves are as righteous as the rain[,] with its sweet Prince-like falsetto; frantic, driving beat; tribal backing vocals; nuanced keyboard and synthesizer flourishes, and smooth, yet sexy Steely Dannish guitar runs.\\" Adam Yawdosyn of The Rutgers Review lists the EP in his Best Songs and Albums of 2018, and calls Professor Caveman the \\"best band in New Brunswick.\\" Members *Rob Romano – guitar and vocals *Shannon Moore – drums *Dan Connolly – bass *Gabe Marquez - guitar *Jon Evers - keys Past members *Louis Ardine – bass *Erica Butts – guitar *Mike Madden – drums *Omar Elshafi – guitar *John Colaiacovo – keys Discography ;EPs *grape.

The Defensive War () was a strategy and phase in the Arauco War between Spain and independent Mapuches. The idea of the Defensive War was conceived by Jesuit father Luis de Valdivia who sought to diminish hostilities, establish a clear frontier and increase missionary work among the Mapuches. Luis de Valdivia believed the Mapuches could be voluntarily converted to Christianity only if there was peace. The Defensive War became Spain’s official policy in 1612 when King Philip III decreed it after reading a letter from Valdivia. By the time the Defensive War was established, war between Spain and the Mapuches had been going on for 70 years. Philip III obtained indulgences from Pope Paul V for those who helped pacify Araucanía by non-violent means.Barros Arana 2000, p. 28. To carry out his missionary work Luis de Valdivia recruited eight Jesuits and two coadjutors in Spain to travel to Chile. The Mapuche toqui Anganamón killed three Jesuit missionaries on December 14, 1612 after he learned the Spanish were protecting his two fugitive wives and two of his daughters. The Spanish did so due to the opposition of the Catholic Church to polygamy. The Defensive War remained Spain’s official policy until 1626. In the book Guerra de Chile, published in 1647, the Defensive War was heavily criticized by maestre de campo and corregidor of Concepción Santiago de Tesillo. De Tesillo claim the Defensive War gave the Mapuche a much needed respite to replenish their forces that should have been denied.

He was a member of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.  Biography  Xing was born in September 1938 in Licheng, Shandong, Republic of China. He enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1953 and graduated from the PLA Nanjing Engineering Institute in 1956. He joined the Communist Party of China the following year. He was a classmate of Li Xinliang, who later served as Commander of the Beijing Military Region. Xing had a military career spanning 50 years. He served as an engineering officer and a regimental commander in the Guangzhou Military Region. He was considered a protege of General Zhang Wannian, and was also connected to General Fu Quanyou. He fought in the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, and was promoted to division commander for his performance in the war. He was later promoted to corps commander. He served as Chief of Staff of the Lanzhou Military Region from 1985 to 1988, and was awarded the rank of major general in 1988.

View on the China threat theory  In 1996, Xing published an article in the Communist Party journal Qiushi, entitled \\"Put an end to the China threat theory\\". He argued that the idea of a rising power threatening the existing order maintained by an established power is rooted in Western imperialism. This logic is imposed on China by the West, whose imperialism is the real cause of instability in the world. He further argued that since the United States maintains a large network of military bases far from its homeland and tries to impose its own values on other nations, it has been and will continue to be a cause of conflicts in the world.

Biography Yren Rotela was born on 9 January 1981 in the Obrero neighborhood of Asunción, Paraguay. She is the second of seven siblings. She came out as a trans woman at age 14, after which she was expelled from school. Professional career In 1999, an instance of police repression against sex workers prompted Rotela to dedicate herself to activism, publicly denouncing the abuses and extortion that affect this community. As a sex worker, she began to organize with her colleagues, and in 2007 she co-founded Panambí: Association of Transvestite, Transsexual, and Transgender People, which adopted its charter in 2008 and obtained legal status in 2009. She served as its president for two terms, from 2012 to 2016. Through Panambí, Yren Rotela denounced violations and promoted the rights and grievances of trans people. She is a leader of the Federation of Women of Paraguay, a member of the María Rivarola Healthcare Rights Movement, of the Forum for Education, the UN Women Advisory Group of Civil Society in Paraguay, the 8M Paraguay movement, and is the national and international head of the Lactrans Network of Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2015 Amnesty International granted her the Peter Benenson Award for the defense of human rights \\"for her tireless work in favor of the dignity of [transvestite, transsexual, and transgender people] in Paraguay, her contribution to the visibility of the drama that this collective lives through in the absence of justice and impunity in hate crimes and other serious abuses of human rights.\\" On 17 March 2015, during meeting No. 154 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, she was part of the delegation that presented the results of the report \\"Denuncias de actos de violencia e impunidad contra personas trans en Paraguay\\" (Reports of Acts of Violence and Impunity Against Trans People in Paraguay), carried out by the Panambí association. Together with Tamara Amarilla, Gabriela Espinoza, and Mariana Sepúlveda, she was appointed as a facilitator of the National System of Judicial Facilitators (SNFJ) in December 2016. Being part of this structure allowed her to advocate for people who need guidance, acting as a link between them and public institutions. Rotela participated in the 47th General Assembly of the Organization of American States, held in Cancún, Mexico, as the Paraguayan representative of the Trans Persons Network of Latin America and the Caribbean (Redlactrans). In the Assembly, the Paraguayan chancellor opposed the approval of an article on the rights of LGBT persons. In September 2017, Rotela gave the talk \\"¿Nos define el sexo?\\" (Does sex define us?) on the Gramo conversation platform. She was a candidate on the Kuña Pyrenda Movement's list for the Senate in the 2018 Paraguayan general election. Part of her platform was based on \\"recognizing the gender identity of trans people, access to economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights for the entire LGBT community, and the approval of a law against all forms of discrimination.\\" In July 2018, she was invited by the United States government to participate in the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), the State Department's main professional exchange program. Name change In December 2016, through a civil trial, Yren Rotela became the first trans person, together with Mariana Sepúlveda, to present a request to change her name in Paraguay. Five months later, on 11 May 2017, she received a favorable opinion from the Civil and Commercial Judge Julia Rosa Alonso Martínez. Under Article 25 of the Constitution of Paraguay, the case marked a milestone in the country's jurisprudence. However the Prosecutor's Office appealed the measure, and the case is still before the Chamber of Civil Appeals; the process can take up to three years. As of October 2017, Paraguay does not have a gender identity or anti-discrimination law.

The state religion of Morocco is Islam. The government plays an active role in determining and policing religious practice for Muslims, and disrespecting Islam in public can carry punishments in the forms of fines and imprisonment. Sunni Islam and Judaism are the only religions recognized by the Moroccan constitution as native to the country, with all other religions being considered \\"foreign\\". While foreigners can generally practice their religion in peace, citizens who practice \\"foreign religions\\" face obstacles from the government and social pressure. In particular, Shia Muslims and members of the Bahá'í Faith face discrimination from the government, as do some Christian groups. Historically, Morocco has oscillated between periods of religious tolerance and intolerance. From the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 698 through the reign Almoravid dynasty in the 11th and 12th centuries, the region experienced a period of significant religious tolerance; Jews and Christians were required to pay special taxes, but otherwise were allowed to practice their religions in peace, allowing for the flourishing of a Jewish Golden Age. The following Almohad Caliphate instituted harsh religious rule, and forced all non-Muslims to convert on pain of death. Later dynasties reinstated policies of religious tolerance, allowing Jews and Christians to return to the country, although these later dynasties were also sometimes marked by the persecution of religious minorities, either by the government or by violent mobs. During World War II, Morocco fell under the Nazi-backed Vichy Regime, which attempted to deport the Jewish population to concentration camps. This attempt was blocked by Mohammed V of Morocco, although other anti-Jewish laws were successfully passed. Following independence in 1956, Morocco established a constitution which re-established Islam as a state religion, and nominally provides for the freedom of religion, although as mentioned above, discrimination against certain minority groups continue to the present day.  Demographics  According to US Government estimates in 2017, more than 99 percent of the population was Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, Shia Muslims, and Bahais. According to Jewish community leaders in 2019, there are an estimated 3,000 to 3,500 Jews, approximately 2,500 of whom reside in Casablanca. The Rabat and Marrakech Jewish communities each have approximately 75 members. Christian leaders estimate there are between 2,000 and 6,000 Christian citizens distributed throughout the country, although some leaders state there may be as many as 25,000. Shia Muslim leaders estimate there are tens of thousands of Shia citizens, with the largest proportion in the north. In addition, there are an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 foreign-resident Shia from Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Leaders of the Ahmadi Muslim community estimate their numbers at 600. Leaders of the Bahai community estimate there are 350-400 members throughout the country. Foreign-resident Christian leaders estimate the foreign-resident Christian population numbers at least 30,000 Roman Catholics and 10,000 Protestants, many of whom are lifelong residents of the country whose families have resided and worked there for generations but do not hold Moroccan citizenship. There is a small foreign-resident Russian Orthodox community in Rabat and a small foreign-resident Greek Orthodox community in Casablanca. Most foreign-resident Christians live in the Casablanca, Tangier, and Rabat urban areas, but small numbers of foreign Christians are present throughout the country. Many are migrants from sub- Saharan Africa. According to BBC Arabic, as of 2019 15% of the population identifies as nonreligious, an increase of 10% over 2013. According to Arab Barometer, 38% of citizens self-identified as \\"religious\\", 44% as \\"somewhat religious\\", and 13% as \\"not religious\\", with younger age cohorts displaying significantly lower levels of religiosity.  History   Early Islamic Morocco (698 – 1060)  Following the invasion of the Maghreb in 698 c.e., the Muslim states controlling territories that roughly correspond to present day Morocco had relatively tolerant attitudes toward their Christian and Jewish subjects, who were considered \\"people of the book\\", although they were required to pay a special religious tax known as jizya. Berbers who did not profess Abrahamic religions, however, were forced to convert to Islam. Following the Berber Revolt, the Moroccan region was divided into several Berber states, some of which maintained Islam as a state religion, while others founded syncretic religions which mixed elements of Islamic, polytheistic, and Jewish religious practice.Abun-Nasr, Jamil M. A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period, pp. 33-34, 42; Cambridge University Press, 1987. While Christianity would largely disappear from the region over the following century, this has been attributed to a combination of social and economic pressure, as well as the waning prestige and influence of the Christian Church in the region, rather than to persecution.The Disappearance of Christianity from North Africa in the Wake of the Rise of Islam C. J. Speel, II Church History, Vol. 29, No. 4 (December, 1960), pp. 379-397 Meanwhile, the Jewish community expanded, particularly in the then-new city of Fez (founded in 789), and experienced a golden age, which would last until roughly the 11th century. In 1033 as part of a broader military conflict, there was a massacre of Jews in Fez by invaders of the Banu Ifran tribe, with thousands killed and many sold into slavery. The rule of the early Muslim dynasties in al-Andalus and the Maghreb comprised what is referred to as a golden age of Jewish culture, which would continue until the rise of the Almohad Caliphate.  Berber dynasties (1060 – 1549)   Almoravid dynasty (1060 – 1147)  The Almoravid dynasty which came to power in the 11th century imposed stricter interpretations of Islamic law on its territories, comprising the western parts of modern Morocco, as well as the southern half of Iberia. While their rule was mostly free of major abuses against religious minorities, social hostility against them increased.Norman Roth, Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict, Brill, 1994, pp.113-116. Additionally, some explicitly anti-Jewish laws were enacted, such as a ban preventing Jews from living in the new Almoravid capital of Marrakesh.M.J. Viguera. \\"Almoravids.\\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2014.  Almohad Caliphate (1147 – 1248)  The Almohad Caliphate represented a significant departure from prior religious policy, both in terms of Islamic law and the treatment of religious minorities. In matters of law, the Zahiri and Ashʿari schools were given preference, and the caliphs of the Almohad Caliphate were hostile to the Maliki school, which had been preferred by the Almoravids.Adang, \\"The Spread of Zahirism in al-Andalus in the Post- Caliphal Period: The evidence from the biographical dictionaries,\\" pg. 297-346. Taken from Ideas, Images and Methods of Portrayal: Insights into Classical Arabic Literature and Islam. Ed. Sebastian Gunther, Leiden: 2005. In the 12th century, laws were passed banning all non-Zahirite religious texts;Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Linguistic Tradition, pg. 142. Part of Landmarks in Linguistic Thought series, vol. 3. New York: Routledge, 1997. by the end of the century, such books were ordered to be burned.Shawqi Daif, Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians, pg. 6. Cairo, 1947. The Almohads abolished the practice of preferential treatment for \\"people of the book\\", ending the practice of jizya, which was replaced by a policy of forced conversion. Following a seventh month grace period,Amira K. Bennison and María Ángeles Gallego. \\"Jewish Trading in Fes On The Eve of the Almohad Conquest.\\" MEAH, sección Hebreo 56 (2007), 33-51 most of the Jews and Christians in Morocco were forced to convert to Islam on pain of death,M.J.

Many cases of Jews and Christians choosing to die as martyrs were recorded. Converts were further treated with suspicion, and were forced to wear identifying clothing.  Marinid and Wattasid dynasties (1248 – 1549)  The Marinid dynasty which followed the Almohad Caliphate represented a return to previous policies of religious tolerance. Members of minority religions, particularly Jews, were appointed to high-ranking official posts in Morocco during this period. The end of the dynasty's rule, however, was punctuated by the 1465 Moroccan revolt, during which almost the entire Jewish community of Fez was killed. During the reign of the Wattasid dynasty which followed, the Jewish population recovered significantly, as refugees fleeing the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition settled in Morocco.  Arab dynasties (1549 – 1830)   Saadi dyansty (1549 – 1659)  The Saadi dynasty reimposed heavy taxes against non- Muslims, but also continued to appoint non-Muslims to positions of authority in Morocco. Local rulers, as well as general Arab society, were not always as tolerant, at times subjecting non-Muslims to harsh humiliations.  Independent Alaouite Morocco (1666 – 1880)  Many of the sultans of the Alaouite dynasty appointed non-Muslims to positions of power, although as a consequence of various power struggles and succession crises, non-Muslims who were awarded with high appointments by one sultan were sometimes later singled out for punishment by his successor. The position of town consul in Morocco was held almost exclusively by Jewish merchants until 1875. Towards the end of this era, European powers extended \\"protection\\" to Jewish communities in Morocco, and then used this as a pretext to interfere in Moroccan politics. During the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859, Jewish communities in Morocco were subject to pogroms. In 1864, Muhammad IV passed a royal decree granting equal rights to Jews. This decree, however, was largely ignored by local authorities. The following sultan, Hassan I, continued his predecessors' policies of tolerance.  European dominion (1880 – 1956)  As the 19th century drew to a close, Morocco fell further under the control of European powers, particularly France and Spain. Following the Agadir Crisis, Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates, which officially recognized Roman Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam as the three religions of Morocco. During this period, intellectuals in the nascent Moroccan nationalist movement tended to advocate for a secular state, favoring the separation of church and state and opposing the influence of religious authorities. The popularity of these tendencies could be attributed first to French republican ideals such as laïcité, and later to the influence of Marxism in Moroccan nationalist politics. During World War II, Morocco was controlled by Vichy France, which attempted to deport Jews to concentration camps as part of the Holocaust. This order was blocked by Mohammed V, technically still the sultan of Morocco under the French protectorate. However, some Nazi race laws were still implemented despite Mohammed's protests, and he was forced to sign certain laws barring Jews from certain schools and government positions.Susan Gilson Miller, A History of Modern Morocco (Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 142-43.  Independence (1956 – present)   Mohammed V (1956 – 1961)  Mohammed V would become the first king of independent Morocco following negotiations with France, establishing the country as a constitutional monarchy. A constitution was drafted during his reign, although it would not be ratified until 1962, after his death. This constitution re-established Islam as the state religion of Morocco, while also according Judaism a privileged status as an integral part of Moroccan society and nominally granting the freedom of religion to people in Morocco.  Hassan II (1961 – 1999)  Following the establishment of an independent Moroccan state by his father, Hassan II presided over a repressive regime known as the Years of Lead. While these decades were primarily known for their political repression, during the 1960s the Bahai Faith community in Morocco faced sharp persecution, with several Bahai sentenced to prison or executed for their faith.  Mohammed VI (1999 – present)  Mohammed VI has generally been described as more liberal than his predecessor, and has enacted reforms to improve the country's human rights record.Text used in this cited section originally came from: Morocco profile from the Library of Congress Country Studies project. Among these is the introduction of civil law concerning divorce (as opposed to religious law). Following the 2003 Casablanca bombings, Morocco engaged in a crackdown against Islamic extremists, arresting thousands, prosecuting 1,200, and sentencing around 900. Religious minorities not specially recognized by the government, such as Christians and Bahai, continue to face obstacles to religious practice. In 2016, a new press code was implemented, removing jail time as a potential punishment for insulting Islam (along with several other types of speech not related to religion), although these acts remain punishable by fines. This change is a reform of a press law implemented in 2002, also during the reign of Mohammed VI. This press code, however, was undermined by further changes to the penal code, which effectively reinstated prison sentences for the charges.  Legal framework  The constitution of Morocco establishes that Islam is the state religion of Morocco, and also grants freedom of thought, expression, assembly, and the right for everyone to \\"conduct their religious affairs\\".International Religious Freedom Report Morocco United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor The constitution also specifically recognizes the Jewish community in Morocco as an integral component of Moroccan society. The Protestant and Catholic Churches, whose existence as foreign-resident churches predates the country's independence in 1956, maintain a special status recognized by the government since independence. According to the constitution, only the High Council of Ulema, a group headed and appointed by the king with representatives from all regions of the country, is authorized to issue fatwas, which become legally binding only through endorsement by the king in a royal decree and subsequent confirmation by parliamentary legislation . If the king or parliament decline to ratify a decision of the Ulema, the decision remains nonbinding and unenforced. The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs oversees the content of sermons in mosques, Islamic religious education, and the dissemination of Islamic religious material by the broadcast media, actions it says are intended to combat violent extremism. The government restricts the distribution of non-Islamic religious materials, as well as Islamic materials it deemed inconsistent with the Maliki-Ashʿari school of Sunni Islam. Religious organizations for faiths other than Sunni Islam and Judaism are required to register with the government as associations in order to operate and own land. Shia Muslim groups have been prevented from registering, and Bahá'í Faith and Christian groups have forgone registration due to the belief that they would not be approved.  Personal status courts  A separate set of laws and special courts govern personal status matters for Jews, including functions such as marriage, inheritance, and other personal status matters. Rabbinical authorities administer Jewish family courts. Muslim judges trained in the country's Maliki-Ashʿari Sunni interpretation of the relevant aspects of sharia administer the courts for personal status matters for all other religious groups. According to the law, a Muslim man may marry a Christian or Jewish woman; a Muslim woman may not marry a man of another religion unless he converts to Islam. Non-Muslims must formally convert to Islam and be permanent residents before they can become guardians of abandoned or orphaned children. Guardianship entails the caretaking of a child, which may last until the child reaches 18, but does not allow changing the child's name or inheritance rights, and requires maintaining the child's birth religion, according to orphanage directors.  Restrictions  The criminal code prohibits proselytization to Muslims, punishable by fines of 200 to 500 Moroccan dirham ($21 to US$53) and 6 months to 3 years of prison. Foreigners may instead be expelled from the country. It is not, however, illegal for Muslims to convert voluntarily. It is illegal to criticize Islam on public platforms, punishable by fines of up to 200,000 dirham (~US$21,000) and up to two years of prison. Impeding people from worship is also illegal, punishable by fines and imprisonment. Muslims who break their fast in public without a religious exception during Ramadan can also be fined and imprisoned. A limited number of Arabic translations of the Bible were available for sale in a few bookshops for use in university religion courses. Authorities confiscated Bibles they believed were intended for use in proselytizing. In January 2017, the Ministry of the Interior banned the sale, manufacture, and import of burqas but did not make it illegal to wear them.  Treatment of \\"foreign\\" religious groups by the government  According to human rights organizations and local Christian leaders, the government has detained and questioned some Christian citizens about their beliefs and contacts with other Christians. Christian and Shia Muslim citizens stated fears of government harassment led to their decision to hold religious meetings in members’ homes. Christian citizens are not allowed to establish churches. Foreign clergy said they discouraged the country's Christian citizens from attending their churches out of fear they could be criminally charged with proselytism. Some Christian citizens reported authorities pressured Christian converts to renounce their faith. On at least two occasions during 2017, the government expelled foreign individuals accused of proselytism as “a threat to public order,” rather than prosecuting them under provisions of the law that prohibit “undermining the faith.” Some Christian citizens have reported authorities pressured Christian converts to renounce their faith by informing the converts’ friends, relatives, and employers of the individuals’ conversion, although there were no reported instances of this practice in 2019.Christian citizens are not allowed to establish churches. Christian citizens stated authorities made phone or house calls several times a year to demonstrate they had lists of members of Christian networks and monitored Christian activities. Foreigners attended religious services without restriction at places of worship belonging to officially recognized churches. Some religious minority groups, such as the Bahai community, practiced their religion without formal registration. In October 2017 media reported that authorities prevented the Bahai community from publicly celebrating the bicentennial of the birth of the faith's founder.  Education  By law, all publicly funded educational institutions must teach Sunni Islam in accordance with the teachings and traditions of the Maliki-Ashari school of Islamic jurisprudence. Foreign-run and privately funded schools have the choice of teaching Sunni Islam or of not including religious instruction within the school's curriculum. Private Jewish schools are able to teach Judaism. The constitution also establishes that public television stations must dedicate five percent of their programming to Islamic religious content, and that they must broadcast the calls to prayer five times a day. Muslim citizens often study at private Christian and private Jewish schools, reportedly primarily because these schools maintained a reputation for offering superior education. According to school administrators, Muslim students constitute a significant portion of the students at Jewish schools in Casablanca.  Societal attitudes  Some Christian, Bahai, and Shia Muslims report societal, familial, and cultural pressure on account of their faith. Passersby have reportedly attacked at least one individual during Ramadan for eating in public during fasting hours. Members of the Bahai Faith are generally open about their faith with family, friends, and neighbors, but feared extremist elements in society would try to do them harm, leading them to ask local police for protection at their gatherings. Shia Muslims report that in some areas, particularly in large cities in the north, they did not hide their faith from family, friends, or neighbors, but that many avoided disclosing their religious affiliation in areas where their numbers were smaller. Jewish citizens report that they live and attend services at synagogues in safety. They said they were able to visit religious sites regularly and to hold annual commemorations. Women who wear hijabs have had difficulty finding employment in the private sector and with the army and police. When they do obtain employment, women report employers either encouraged or required them to remove their headscarves during working hours.

Early life  Kamichika was born in what is now Saza, Nagasaki on June 6, 1888. She studied at Tsuda University, where she became affiliated with the Bluestocking society. After graduation she became a teacher at the Aomori Prefectural School for Girls, until she was asked to leave when her connection to the Bluestockings was discovered. She began writing for the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun in 1914. Kamichika also met Ōsugi Sakae in 1914. In 1915, after they grew close enough that Ōsugi would stay at Kamichika's house over the weekend when he visited Tokyo to teach French classes. They began having an affair. Ōsugi was married at the time. In 1916 he also started a relationship with Itō Noe. The three women had a tense relationship, which culminated in November 1916, when Kamichika stabbed Ōsugi in an incident that was later called the Hayama Hikage Chaya scandal, after the teahouse in Hayama, Kanagawa where the incident took place.

Various dates from 8th century AD downwards and numerous family links have been assigned to Adi Sura by the genealogical texts or kulajis, belonging to the late medieval period.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., History of Ancient Bengal, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata, pages 442, 413, 409-415, first published 1971, first Tulshi edition, 2005. Historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, in his History of Ancient Bengal, says, \\"King Adisura is the pivot round which the genealogical accounts move. No positive evidence has yet been obtained of his existence, but we have undoubted reference to a Sura family ruling in Western Bengal in the eleventh century. Adisura may or may not be a historical person but it is wrong to assert dogmatically that he was a myth and to reject the whole testimony of the Kulajis on that ground alone.\\" Quoting various genealogical tables, an earlier historian Rakhaldas Bandopahyay, in his Banglar Itihas (History of Bengal), mentions that when the son-in-law of King Jayanta of Gauda Kingdom, ascended the throne he adopted the name of Adisura.Bandopadhayay, Rakhaldas, Banglar Itihas (History of Bengal), , Nababharat Publishers, Kolkata, page 103, 1979 edition. The story of the Brahmins All the Kulajis maintain that bulk of the Brahmins in Bengal are descendants of the five Brahmins who came at the invitation of king Adisura from Kannauj. There is a story that king Adisura requested the king of Kannauj (or Kolancha) to send five Brahmins versed in the Vedas and Vedic sacrifices. On being refused, Adisura decided to go to war against him. The king of Kannauj was a devout Brahmin. Devotion to Brahmins and cows was natural to him. Adisura sent seven hundred Brahmins from Bengal, seated on bulls, to wage war against the king of Kannauj. As expected, the latter did not fight but sent five Brahmins to Bengal as requested. The five Brahmins, along with five attendants, armed with bows and arrows came on horse-back. On not being received by king Adisura with proper respect, they threw away the flowers and herbs they had brought to bless the king on to a stump of wood, which immediately grew into a living tree. The spectacle impressed the king, he begged their pardon and welcomed them properly. They performed the sacrifice and returned to Kannauj. On return, they were deemed to have been degraded because of their visit to Bengal and asked to offer penances. They refused and came back to Bengal with their families and servants. Adisura gave them five villages to live in. There are numerous versions and variations of this story. Ramesh Chandra Majumdar says, \\"We may freely admit that the Kulajis contain a kernel of historical truth about the social condition of the Brahmanas in the closing centuries of the Hindu period, their story with all the details can by no means be regarded as of any historical value… The same conclusion may be drawn from the Kulaji accounts of Vaidyas, Kayasthas and other castes, which belong to the same type as those of the Brahmanas and cannot be considered as of greater historical value.\\" References Category:Rulers of Bengal ","title":"Adi Sura"},{"id":"60225545","text":"Map of the Somali Civil War, up to date as of 2016 Freedom of religion in Somalia refers to the extent to which people in Somalia are freely able to practice their religious beliefs, taking into account government policies, non-state actors, and societal attitudes toward religious groups. Due to the Somali Civil War, the enforcement of laws pertaining to religion by the various autonomous governments in the region is inconsistent. Sunni Islam is the state religion in Somalia. Generally, the judiciary in most areas relies on xeer (traditional and customary law), sharia, and the penal code. In many regions, activity by Salafi groups further restricts religious freedom, as individuals are afraid of reprisal. Islam has been a core part of Somali national identity for the entirety of its modern history. A 1961 constitution established Islam as the state religion, and later governments have maintained this policy. The Somali Democratic Republic, which existed from 1969 to 1991, propagated an ideology merging elements of Islam and Marxism. Following the collapse of this government, Somalia has experienced a prolonged civil war which has continued on and off since the 1990s. The official transitional national government has continued to uphold Islam as the state religion, and further established that the Somali legal code is based on principles of Islamic law. The region of Somaliland, which seceded at the outset of the civil war and remains autonomous but internationally unrecognized, has established its own constitution founded on similar religious precepts. Activity by various Islamist insurgent groups further limits religious freedom, as individuals who do not comply with these groups' interpretations of Islamic law are targeted for reprisals.  Demographics  Although Pew Research Center has not conducted a survey in Somalia, its Somali-majority northwestern neighbour Djibouti reported a creed breakdown of Muslims which was reported as 77% adhering to Sunnism, 8% as non-denominational Muslim, 2% as Shia, thirteen percent refusing to answer, and a further report inclusive of Somali Region stipulating 2% adherence to a minority sect (e.g. Ibadism, Quranism etc.).https://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity- and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity According to the federal Ministry of Religious Affairs, more than 99 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. Members of other religious groups combined constitute less than 1 percent of the population and include a small Christian community, a small Sufi Muslim community, and an unknown number of Shia Muslims. Immigrants and foreign workers, who are mainly from East African countries, belong mainly to other religious groups.  History   Early independence (1960 – 1969)  In 1960, the State of Somaliland gained independence from the United Kingdom, and passed a constitution which largely did not mention religion, although it acknowledged a link between Somali customary law (one of the legal bases of the constitution) and Islamic law. The State of Somaliland merged with the Trust Territory of Somaliland to form the Somali Republic, which ratified a constitution by popular referendum in 1961. This constitution established Islam as the state religion, but nominally accorded religious freedom to all individuals in the country. The constitution further established that Islamic law would be the basis of legislation in the country. A 1963 amendment banned proselytizing for religions other than Islam.  Somali Democratic Republic (1969 – 1991)  In 1969, following the assassination of President Abdirashid Shermarke and a nearly-bloodless coup,Moshe Y. Sachs (1988) Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations, Vol. 2, Worldmark Press, p. 290, . the country was renamed the Somali Democratic Republic and the 1961 constitution was suspended.J. D. Fage, Roland Anthony Oliver (1985) The Cambridge history of Africa, Vol. 8, Cambridge University Press, p. 478, . The new regime, led by the Supreme Revolutionary Council, established new foreign policy that emphasized Somalia's religious connections to the Arab world.Benjamin Frankel (1992) The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World, Gale Research, p. 306 . In 1976, the Supreme Revolutionary Council was disbanded and replaced by the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, whose ruling ideology drew on both the Marxism–Leninist principles of scientific socialism and on Islamic law, with Islam remaining as the state religion. Emphasis was placed on Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued were part and parcel to communism.de la Fosse Wiles, Peter John (1982) The New Communist Third World: an essay in political economy, Taylor & Francis, p. 279 .  Civil war  Following the collapse of central authority in Somalia in the early 1990s, Islamic courts in Somalia began to assert more power. Somaliland unilaterally declared its independence, and adopted a constitution which established Islam as the state religion, banning the propagation of other faiths, and establishing Islamic law as the basis of the legal code of Somaliland. A 1995 draft constitution officially re- established Sunni Islam as the state religion in Somalia, and subsequent transitional governments passed legal charters which established Islamic law as the basis of Somali legal codes. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union seized control of much of the southern parts of Somalia. It was removed from power later that year, and the Transitional Government reasserted control over much of the country with aid from Ethiopian forces. Following its defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into many different groups, including Al- Shabaab. In 2009, in order to contain an ongoing insurgency by Islamist groups, the Transitional Government formed a unified government together with some remaining elements of the Islamic Courts Union. A new provisional constitution granting nominal individual religious freedom and maintaining Islam as the state religion was adopted in 2012.  Legal framework  The provisional constitution of Somalia provides for the right of individuals to practice their religion, makes Islam the state religion, prohibits the propagation of any religion other than Islam (although it does not explicitly ban conversion), and stipulates all laws must comply with the general principles of Muslim religious law. No exemptions from the application of sharia legal principles exist for non-Muslims, although most implementations of Islamic law occur at the regional, as opposed to the national, level. The federal government of Somalia had limited ability to implement its laws beyond greater Mogadishu; most other areas of Somalia were outside its control.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Somalia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The provisional constitution requires the president, but not other office holders, to be Muslim. There are no public places of worship for non-Muslims in the country. The national penal code generally remains valid in all regions of the country. It does not prohibit conversion from Islam to another religion, but it criminalizes blasphemy and “defamation of Islam,” which carry penalties of up to two years in prison. According to federal and regional government officials, there were no cases of individuals charged with apostasy, blasphemy, or defamation of Islam in 2017. The federal Ministry of Education has the mandate to regulate religious instruction throughout the country. Federal and regional authorities require Islamic instruction in all schools, public or private, except those operated by non-Muslims. Private schools have more leeway to determine their curriculum. Non-Muslim students attending public schools may request an exemption from Islamic instruction, but according to federal and regional authorities, there have been no such requests. While missionary groups exist in Somalia, they face significant legal and societal barriers to their activities, and often even have difficulty carrying out humanitarian aid missions.  Societal attitudes  Somali territories mostly colored Prussian blue (Shafi'i Sunni); with some old gold (non-denominational Muslims) and Brandeis blue (Hanafi Sunni). There is a strong societal pressure to adhere to Sunni traditions. Conversion from Islam to another religion has been socially unacceptable in all areas of Somalia. Those suspected of conversion face harassment by members of their community.  Somaliland  The constitution of Somaliland declares Islam as the state religion, prohibits Muslims from converting to another religion, bars the propagation of any religion other than Islam, and require all laws to comply with the general principles of sharia. It also states that \\"every person shall have the right to freedom of belief and shall not be compelled to adopt another belief\\". In July 2017, Somaliland authorities closed the only Catholic church in Hargeisa. The Somaliland constitution requires, in addition to Somaliland's president, the candidates for vice president and the House of Representatives to be Muslim. The Somaliland constitution prohibits the formation of political parties based on a particular religious group, religious beliefs, or interpretation of religious doctrine. In Somaliland, religious schools and formal places of worship must obtain permission to operate from the Ministry of Religious Affairs.  Puntland  The constitution of Puntland declares Islam as the state religion, prohibits Muslims from converting to another religion, bars the propagation of any religion other than Islam, and require all laws to comply with the general principles of sharia. The constitution prohibits any law or culture that contravenes Islam and prohibits demonstrations contrary to Islam. The constitution and other laws of Puntland do not define contravention of Islam. The Puntland constitution requires the president, but not other office holders, to be Muslim. In Puntland, religious schools and formal places of worship must obtain permission to operate from the Ministry of Justice and Religious Affairs. In June 2017, al-Shabaab fighters stormed an army base in Puntland, killing 70 persons and wounding dozens more. al-Shabaab said it attacked the base because of the presence of foreign soldiers and Puntland “apostates.” As of 2017, ISIS-affiliated fighters maintained a presence in the northern regions of Puntland.  Al-Shabaab  Al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda- affiliated militant group in Somalia, has killed, maimed, or harassed persons suspected of converting from Islam or those who failed to adhere to the group's religious edicts. Al-Shabaab was responsible for the killings of civilians, government officials, members of parliament, Somali national armed forces, police, and troops from contributing countries of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), with the BBC reporting that 2019 was one of the bloodiest years on record with over 1,200 casualties by October. Al-Shabaab characterizes the AMISOM peacekeeping forces and workers for humanitarian groups as “Christians” intent on invading and occupying the country. Fear of reprisals from al-Shabaab often prevented religious groups from operating freely. Al-Shabaab reportedly threatened to close mosques in areas it controlled if the mosques’ teachings did not conform to the group's interpretation of Islam. In areas under its control, al-Shabaab continued to mandate schools teach a militant form of jihad emphasizing that students should wage war against those it deemed infidels, including countries in the region, the federal government, and AMISOM. Following the introduction of its new education curriculum in April 2017, al-Shabaab began forcing communities in Hirshabelle and Galmudug to enroll children ages seven to 14 into al- Shabaab-managed madrasas, according to humanitarian groups. Al-Shabaab arrested or fined parents who failed to comply with the directive. According to humanitarian groups, on June 17, al-Shabaab militants in Harardhere arrested 17 elders for refusing to obey the group's edict; days later, the group released 15 of the elders who promised to enroll 50 children. On June 20, al-Shabaab threatened parents in Jowle, Dhalwo, and Tulo-Hajji villages for refusing to enroll persons 10 to 20 years old in the newly opened al- Shabaab-managed madrassahs in Jowle and Xarardhere, according to humanitarian groups. On July 4, humanitarian groups reported that at least 100 elders, imams, and teachers of madrasas not linked to al-Shabaab were arrested within the vicinity of Warshubo, Xarardhere, for resisting al-Shabaab's school enrollment demands. Reports from humanitarian groups indicated that in early July al-Shabaab abducted at least 45 elders in El Buur District for failing to hand over 150 children to the group.  Other regions  The interim governments of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, Jubaland, and South West State of Somalia, have constitutions identifying Islam as the official religion. These constitutions stipulate all laws must comply with the general principles of sharia. The constitutions of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, and South West State have not enacted laws directly addressing religious freedom.

K. Surya Prabhakar and produced by Rajesh Uthaman. The film features Harish Uthaman and Nisha in lead roles, with Benito Franklin, Madhankumar, Shanmugam, Vetrivel, Govindan, Chellamuthu, K. K. P. Gopalakrishnan, and Vasanthi playing supporting roles. The film had musical score by Sri Vijay, cinematography by V. S. Devaraj, and editing by Kasi Viswanathan. The film released on 3 December 2010. Plot The film begins with the groom Surya (Harish Uthaman) getting ready to marry Jothi (Nisha) and narrating a flashback. In a flashback, the young man Surya was a blue-collar worker in a metal workshop. His parents (K. K. P. Gopalakrishnan and Vasanthi) wanted him to get married, but Surya was quite shy by nature, had low self-esteem, and his only social life was when he met his five friends who were unlike him. Anbu (Benito Franklin) who owned a photo studio, was a married man and a womanizer. Velliangiri (Vetrivel) was a carefree young man working in a cotton factory. Varathan (Madhankumar) was a loan lender who liked watching adult films and spending time with prostitutes. Govindan (Govindan) was a middle-aged man who was an ardent fan of Kamal Haasan and desperately wanted to get married. Shanmugam (Shanmugam) was a wastrel who tried to woo a village girl. Anbu advised Surya to follow his methods of wooing, but it failed miserably. Surya then watched adult films in a cinema theatre and went to a brothel as Varathan did, but when a prostitute touched his hand, Surya ran away from the place. Surya's parents then found him a girl: Jothi, a beautiful young woman who studied computer science. However, Jothi did not want to marry Surya: she found him not-good-looking and not educated enough; above all else, she was afraid of him. Surya then tried to change his looks and behavior. The two eventually got engaged with the blessings of their family. Later, Surya, who became an overprotective fiancé, suspected her college mate Kishore (J. Durairaj) of wooing Jothi and beat him up. Surya then tried to keep Anbu from his fiancé, and one day revealed Anbu's seduction activities to his family, and the two got into a fight. Surya even suspected her uncle (Kovai Madhan) from Dubai of wooing Jothi. In the meantime, Jothi started to like Surya for being caring and protective. The day before the wedding, a tensed Surya beat up Jothi's uncle; thus, the wedding was cancelled and her father Chellamuthu (Chellamuthu) wanted Jothi to marry her uncle. Surya and his family returned home. A saddened Surya drank poison. Shortly after, he came to know that his wedding was not cancelled and then fainted. Surya was rushed to the hospital and died in the hospital bed. Back to the present, Surya's body is buried in a cemetery and it was his spirit who narrated the flashback, while Jothi mourns the loss of her fiancé at his grave.

The film was shot in the drylands of Coimbatore and lush greens of Kerala. The debutante music director Sri Vijay was from Sri Lanka. Kasi Viswanathan took care of the editing and the cinematography was by V. S. Devaraj. Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Sri Vijay.

A reviewer said, \\"The debutante music director has shown promise\\". Release The film was released on 3 December 2010 alongside Chikku Bukku and Ratha Sarithiram. Critical reception Behindwoods.com rated the film 2 out of 5 and said, \\"The hero Sri Hari and heroine Nisha carry off the demands of their character well [..] there is more of a mature relationship of understanding being formed than any romance happening on screen. That treatment puts Thaa on a different track from other love based subjects and director Shurya Prabakar deserves credit for adopting this treatment\\".

Biography Jin Watanabe was born on February 16, 1887, in Sado, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, and grew up in Tokyo. His father was Wataru Watanabe (渡辺渡), who became director of the Tokyo Imperial University Institute of Technology. In July 1912, Watanabe graduated from Tokyo Imperial University's Institute of Technology, and after graduation served at the Railroad Institute. In 1926, he visited Europe and the United States for architectural research. Name His given name (the character 仁) can be read as either Jin or Hitoshi. Works Watanabe is known in particular for designing the Imperial Household Museum (1931-1938), the Hattori Clock shop and the Daiichi Seimei Insurance Building (c. 1938, in collaboration with architect Yosaku Matsumoto) in Tokyo. In 1931, a competition was held to replace the original Imperial Household Museum building. This had been designed by Josiah Conder, and completed in 1882. However, it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1923. Watanabe won the competition with a design that followed the lineage of Imperial Crown Style, having a neo-classical base topped with tiled and gabled Japanese-style roofs. Although constructed from reinforced concrete, some elements of the building alluded to traditional Japanese timber construction techniques. It is today known as the Honkan building at the Tokyo National Museum. The Dai-ichi Seimei building is located across the street from the main entrance to the Imperial Palace grounds in the Marunouchi area of Tokyo. It was chosen by General Douglas MacArthur as the site for Allied Headquarters from 1945-1952.  Selected works  The Tokyo National Museum's Honkan building.

According to PKP it has the status of a regional station. It serves mainly regional traffic between Łódź and Sieradz, although it is also a stopping point for PKP Intercity services between Warsaw and Wrocław.  History  The station was built as part of the Warsaw-Kalisz Railway, which was opened in 1902. The main building of the station was made in the Renaissance Revival style, the same which was used for other smaller stations of the line such as those in Łowicz, Zgierz, Łask, Zduńska Wola and Sieradz. Unlike some of the latter stations, this one has retained its original facades despite major refurbishment in 1934, 2005 and 2011. Since 1902 the station utilizes 3 platforms: one single-edged and two double-edged, but each platform acted like single-edged. From 2019 till September 2020 the platform layout of the station was changed due to refurbishment of the railway served by station. The new layout consists of one island platform and one side platform, each connected with an underground passage. From 1924 to 1968 the station served as a terminal stop for a tram line, which runs from Łódź via Ksawerów. In 1968 the tram terminal was dismantled after the construction of a turning loop near the intersection of Łaska and Wiejska streets, located 300 m southwest of the station.  Public transit  The station is served by bus lines maintained by MZK Pabianice (bold name indicates terminal stop): * Line 1: Dworzec PKP - Waltera-Jankego * Line 3: Dworzec PKP - Sikorskiego * Line 5: Dworzec PKP - Waltera-Jankego * Line 260: Waltera-Jankego - Dworzec PKP - Kudrowice - Górka Pabianicka * Line 262: Waltera-Jankego - Dworzec PKP - Kudrowice * Line 265: Dworzec PKP - Pawlikowice (selected services) * Line T: Dworzec PKP - Rzgów - Guzew Moreover, the area of the station is served by two lines operated by MPK Łódź: * Tram line 41 (Łódź Plac Niepodległości - Pabianice Wiejska) - tram stop located at the intersection of Łaska and Szare Szeregi streets. * Night bus line N4B (Pabianice Dworzec PKP - Stoki Skalna) - bus terminus.

It is thought that she did not know her parents, but believed them to have been of African descent. Her 1863 death notice named them as Captain Sir Francis Jackson and Cecilia Hotham, but there is no evidence for this claim. Recent research by historians has identified them instead as Lydia Holloway, an unmarried domestic servant, and John King, a footman. In 1836 Fanny was granted free passage to the newly proclaimed colony of South Australia as a domestic servant. She sailed with her employers, William and Julia Wyatt, from Gravesend aboard the John Renwick and arrived in Adelaide on 10 February 1837. William Wyatt was the appointed Surgeon on the ship and wrote an account of the voyage which references Fanny.\\"South Australian Record\\" 8 and 11 November 1837 In Adelaide she continued working for Julia Wyatt, an author and artist and the wife of William Wyatt, who was appointed the third South Australian Protector of Aborigines.  Marriage and children  Fanny married Joseph Finch on 8 December 1838 in Adelaide. They had five children, Frances (1839-1932), Mary (1841-1916), James John (1843-1895), John (1846-1859) and Lewis (1848-1848). In about 1850, a year before the Victorian gold rushes began, Fanny and her four children left Adelaide for Victoria. Some sources suggest that Joseph Finch travelled with the family to Victoria, while others say that Fanny and the children went without him. Some sources suggest that the marriage ended with Fanny's move to Victoria; others say that she and Joseph Finch had at least two more children together. However, Joseph could not have been the father of Fanny's children Jane (1855-1855) and Louisa (1858-1859), which she claimed he was on their birth registrations, as he was in prison in Melbourne at the time Victorian Central Register of Male Prisoners 1853 No.1136 under the alias John WilliamsHer death notice mentions 16 children, 3 of them still alive at the time of her death, but the notice is known to contain other inaccuracies.  Business  By 1852 the gold rush had begun and Fanny was running a restaurant and lodging house at Forest Creek, a gold rush settlement near Castlemaine. She later moved to Castlemaine and by 1854 was running a well-known restaurant. In 1855 she was prosecuted for selling spirits without a licence. The trial was covered in the goldfields press and prompted accusations that the police involved had behaved unfairly. In an anonymous letter to the Mount Alexander Mail, one supporter wrote that Finch's \\"restaurant at Forest Creek ... was the only one in which any person could get respectable accommodation.\\" Finch was fined for the unlicensed liquor sale and in 1856 her restaurant was raided by police. She defended herself and demanded an apology in a letter published in the Mount Alexander Mail, an unusual step for a working-class woman in the male-dominated goldfields at the time.  Voting  In 1856, during elections at Castlemaine, Finch and another unknown woman completed and signed voting cards in the city hall. At the time the law, passed in 1854, gave all \\"rate-paying persons\\" the right to vote, but the Australian women's suffrage movement was in its infancy and the wording appears to have been an oversight rather than a deliberate extension of the vote to women. The afternoon of the vote, election officiators disallowed both women's votes, on the grounds that \\"they had no right to vote\\". A report in the Melbourne Argus described Fanny Finch as \\"the famous Mrs Finch\\" and her participation as \\"an incident of the day\\". In 1865, the Municipal Institutions Act (1854) was amended to explicitly exclude women from the vote in Victorian local elections, by changing \\"rate-paying persons\\" to \\"rate-paying men\\".  Death and legacy  Finch died of inflammation of the lungs on 15 October 1863 at Castlemaine, aged 48. Her voting card from 1856 is on display at the Castlemaine Art Museum. In 2020 a memorial to Finch was erected in the Castlemaine general cemetery.

He discovered the cause of Hirschsprung's disease and in 1948, with Alexander Bill, performed the first pull-through operation in a child with megacolon, which then became a treatment for the disease. Initially a resident in pathology, he soon became an assistant professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard and later moved to Boston's Floating Hospital for Children as surgeon-in-chief, where he was the first pediatric surgeon on the staff at the hospital and where he began his research in Hirschsprung's disease. Subsequently he became surgeon-in-chief of Children's Memorial Hospital, where he remained until his retirement in 1973. In 1973, Swenson was elected president of the American Pediatric Surgical Association. He authored Swenson's Pediatric Surgery, which ran into five editions and he was the recipient of a number of awards including the E. Mead Johnson Award, the William E. Ladd Medal and the Denis Browne Gold Medal. Early life Swenson was born in Helsingborg, Sweden, in 1909. His parents, Amanda and Carl Albert Swenson, were missionaries for the Community of Christ and relocated their family to Independence, Missouri, in 1917. Both parents died when Orvar was a teenager, and he and his brother Alvin lived in a boarding house where they started a business, Woodcraft, which sold fire-by-friction sets, bows and arrows, and field hockey sticks. Orvar graduated from William Chrisman High School in 1929 and William Jewell College in 1933. The same year, Orvar and Alvin were admitted to Harvard Medical School, where they successfully petitioned the dean to be placed in the same class so that they could share textbooks in order to save money. They graduated from Harvard in 1937. Career Swenson began his medical career as an intern at Ohio State University. After a year, he returned to Boston to work at Boston Children's Hospital and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Initially a resident in pathology, he took a residency in surgery from 1939 to 1945, after which he became an assistant professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard while working on the pediatric surgical staff at Boston Children's Hospital. In 1949 he moved to Boston's Floating Hospital for Children as surgeon-in-chief, making him the first pediatric surgeon on the staff at the hospital. Subsequently he moved to Chicago in 1960 to become the surgeon-in-chief of Children's Memorial Hospital, where he remained until his retirement in 1973. After his retirement from clinical practice, he moved to Miami and taught at the University of Miami until 1980. Hirschsprung's disease Swenson's main contributions to pediatric surgery focused on Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disease in which nerves are absent from part of the colon, causing constipation and megacolon (abnormal dilation of the colon). He began his research on the condition while he was a surgical resident in Boston. He discovered that the disease was caused by an absence of ganglion cells in the rectum, but before clarity on the cause of the disease, with Alexander Bill, they designed a surgical procedure to remove the abnormal section of the bowel, pull-through the normal bowel and join it to the remaining parts of the normal bowel. When Swenson performed the procedure in 1948, it was the first successful surgical correction of megacolon. It was not however a real Hirschsprung's, as Swenson clarified later in an interview when Bill had said to him that \\"this is just a weird case; it's not a real Hirschsprung's disease\\". This operation, however, became the only procedure that treated Hirschsprung's disease and became known as the \\"Swenson pull-through\\". He described the hallmark clinical and radiological markers of Hirschsprung's disease in newborns and showed that the only way to make a definitive diagnosis was to perform a full-thickness rectal biopsy. Swenson subsequently followed his patients for a number of years. Over his career, he traveled to India, Australia, South America, Europe and Canada to demonstrate his procedure. Other surgical work As well as Hirschsprung's disease, Swenson worked on the treatment of other birth defects. He performed esophageal anastomoses for esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula, and resection and anastomosis in intestinal atresia. He was among the first to advocate performing a pelvic osteotomy when treating bladder exstrophy and for partial nephrectomy in bilateral Wilms' tumors. Awards and honors He served as president of the American Pediatric Surgical Association in 1973–1974, and was the author of Swenson's Pediatric Surgery, a textbook that was published in five editions from 1958 to 1990. He received the E. Mead Johnson Award from the Society for Pediatric Research in 1952, the William E. Ladd Medal from the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1959, and the Denis Browne Gold Medal from the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons in 1979. Personal life Swenson married Melva Elizabeth Criley in 1941; they had three daughters. He died in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2012, aged 103.

Background  A woman who had entered unused land adjoining the sea in order to witness a sunset sustained serious injuries after falling down a steep ridge leading to the beach. Seeking compensation for her injuries, the woman argued that the owners of the land had failed to discharge their duty of care under the Occupiers Liablity Act 1995. The 1995 Act imposes obligations on occupiers in respect of the state of their premises in relation to three categories of entrant: visitor, recreational user and trespasser. Section 4 of the Act establishes the extent of the duty of care owed to recreational users and trespassers alike, namely, that the occupier must refrain from acting with ‘reckless disregard’. It was accepted in both the High Court and the Supreme Court that this was the defendants’ duty to the plaintiff. In the High Court, Butler J decided that the defendants were in breach of their statutory duty but found the plaintiff to be guilty of contributory negligence. The defendants appealed the High Court’s finding of liability to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court faced two primary questions: first, the degree of culpability necessary to trigger liability under Section 4; and, second, how to characterise the culpability, if any, that attached to the defendant’s failure to erect a warning notice at the relevant location.  Supreme Court Decision  Geoghegan J delivered the judgment of a unanimous Court. He held that, in enacting the 1995 Act, it was the intention of the Oireachtas to diminish the duty of care previously owed at common law to entrants meeting the statutory definitions of trespasser and recreational user: > I will begin my treatment of the law by quoting paragraph 12.16 of McMahon > and Binchy, Law of Torts (3rd ed.) under the heading of “Occupiers Liability > to Trespassers”. The learned authors say the following: “This branch of the > law was drastically overhauled twenty five years ago in Ireland. After > McNamara v. ESB was handed down by the Supreme Court in 1975, the duty owed > to trespassers in Ireland was the duty to take reasonable care. The > Occupiers Liability Act, 1995, however, has reversed this and has restored > the old pre-McNamara common law standard, that is, that the duty owed to > trespassers is not to injure them intentionally and not to act with reckless > disregard (for) their person or property…”.[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 476 On enumerating the factors to which Section 4 (subsection 2) requires judges to attend in applying the prescribed standard of, ‘no reckless disregard’, Geoghegan J noted that these factors were equally applicable to the application of the higher standard of reasonable care, and, consequently, that her consideration of these factors might cause an unwary judge to overlook the fact that the former standard imposes a more onerous threshold on the plaintiff trespasser or recreational user. He speculated that this was, ‘exactly what happened in this case and that the learned trial judge unconsciously fell into this trap.\\"[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 748 Turning to address the meaning of, ‘reckless disregard’, Geoghegan J recalled Section 4’s legislative history: > The [Law Reform] Commission rejected [the] advice [that the relevant duty > should be an ordinary duty of reasonable care] and… recommended a threshold > of “gross negligence”. The Oireachtas, however, did not adopt that > expression in the legislation and instead went back to the old expression > “reckless disregard”. It may well be reasonable to argue therefore that the > threshold is even higher than “gross negligence.\\"[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at > 478-479 Having confirmed that an occupier’s Section 4 duty is less burdensome than the duty of reasonable care owed to those entrants meeting the statutory definition of visitor (and, in respect of her activitieson the premises, to all entrants) the Court proceeded to evaluate the culpability, if any, that attached to the defendant’s failure to erect a warning sign at the relevant location. Referring to the series of Scottish judgments cited by Lord Hutton in the decision of the UK House of Lords in Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council [2003] 3 All E.R. 1122, 1155, Geoghegan J endorsed the view that the law offers protection against only some of the risks that we face in ordinary life. Accordingly, he held that: > The person sitting down near a cliff… assumes the inherent risks associated > therewith.[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 480 Applying this principle, Geoghegan J observed that the logical implication of considering the defendant culpable for their failure to erect a warning notice was an expectation that huge areas of coastline right around Ireland ought to be, ‘littered with warning notices’, a result which he characterized as, \\"extreme.\\"[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 475 He concluded that: > It is perfectly obvious to all users of land higher than sea level but > adjoining the sea that there may well be a dangerous cliff edge and in those > circumstances the occupier of the lands cannot be held to be unreasonable in > not putting up a warning notice. Still less has he reckless disregard for > the safety of the person using the land.[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 479 From the conclusion that the defendant’s failure to put up a notice gave rise to no culpability whatever, it followed that the plaintiff would not have succeeded even if she had been subject to the less onerous threshold of showing merely that the defendant had not taken all reasonable care: > [E]ven if the duty on the occupier in this case was the ordinary Donoghue v > Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 neighbourly duty of care the respondent would not > be entitled to succeed.[2005] 1 I.L.R.M. 471 at 478  External links  * Weir Rodgers -v- The S.F.

The airfield serves as a regional port and is privately owned and maintained.  History  Aldinga Airfield was built in 1976 by a group of pilots who wanted an authentic airfield that could access the McLaren Vale wine region. The airfield received significant support from other pilots and aviators and was eventually built with a paved runway, and constructed parking areas. Today the airfield is used mostly by private pilots, Adelaide Biplanes and people who are passing through from Kangaroo Island, Eyre Peninsula and other places. The airfield is outside the main Adelaide controlled airspace, making it easy for VFR pilots to operate in and out of the airfield. The airfield has over 50 parking hangars, most of which are privately owned. The perimeter of the airfield is housed with a hip-level fence, which gives an unblocked view of aircraft landing on the runways. However, especially on approach for runway 32, there are large trees and heavy shrubs at close to the runway threshold, which can be tricky and dangerous for pilots who are landing or departing from that runway.  Facilities  The airfield has four runways. Runway 03/21 is the longest runway, with a total length of . It is the only paved and marked runway at the aerodrome. Runway 14/32 runs perpendicular to runway 03/21. It is a dirt strip with a total length of . There are 2 other shorter grass runways, 08/26 and 18/36. Aldinga Airfield has a parking facility, which offers overnight parking. There is also a café that is open 7 days a week and an avgas pump.

Background  The appellant (Mr Tracey) brought proceedings against the respondents in the High Court seeking damages and financial loss following the termination of a contract. The High Court judge (Kearns P) held that the relevant case did not involve defamation proceedings and that the appellant had no right to a jury trial. As a result, Kearns P ordered that the case be transferred from the jury list to the non- jury list (and so would not be heard by a jury) and ordered that the appellant pay the respondents' costs. The appellant was not present or represented during the High Court proceedings and at the time failed to give the court an explanation as to his absence that was satisfactory to the High Court judge (the High Court judge having previously notified the appellant that his claim might be dismissed in the event of no proper medical certificate being produced to explain his absence). Rather than applying to have the High Court decision set aside (on the basis that the order should not have been made by Kearns P in the appellant's absence), the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court claiming that his case did involve issues of defamation and that the High Court judge was biased against him.  Holding of the Supreme Court   Defamation and bias  MacMenamin J delivered the only written judgment for the Supreme Court (with which the other judges agreed). The Supreme Court rejected the appellant's argument that the High Court judge had been biased or that he had in any way acted improperly.Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [32]. The order that the High Court made was not one to dismiss the appellant's claim, but was, rather, a much less significant procedural order that the case be transferred to the non-jury list. The Supreme Court held that such a procedural order to transfer the case to the non-jury list was correct as these proceedings could not properly be characterised as defamation proceedings.Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [32]. While there exists a right to a jury trial in cases of defamation, defamation requires \\"explicit and clear pleading\\", something that was not done in this case. In the absence of any such pleading the Supreme Court noted that \\"[i]t does not lie within the power of this Court to now, effectively, 'transform' this claim into 'defamation proceedings' , or even a 'part-defamation' proceedings.\\"Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [42].  Access to justice  MacMenamin J then took the opportunity to provide guidance on the courts' ability to limit the right of access to the courts and, in extreme cases, to dismiss proceedings. Alluding to recent incidents that had occurred in other court proceedings, MacMenamin J noted that it was \\"necessary to reiterate some matters which are fundamental\\". These are that: > \\"[i]n all legal proceedings, whether a litigant is legally represented or > not, a point may be reached where the conduct of such litigation is so > dilatory, or so vexatious, or proceeds in a manner which either breaks or > ignores rules of procedure, or where there is such egregious misconduct > either before court, or in court itself, as to raise questions as to whether > the right of access to the court should be limited, or, in extreme cases, > whether a case should actually be struck out. Put simply, the questions are > whether there is abuse of process to such a degree that a claim simply > should not be allowed to proceed, or whether such a claim should be allowed > to proceed only under identified procedural conditions, or in a manner > proportionate to the circumstances, while seeking, as far as is practicable, > to vindicate that constitutional right to litigate proceedings.\\"Tracey, T/A > Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [45]. The fact that an appellant represents themselves in court does not alter the duties owed to that court, or the obligation to comply with the rules of court. Citing from the case of O'Reilly McCabe v. Minister for Justice,& Patrick Cusack Smith & Co (Agents of Thomas McCabe, Ward of Court & Minor)[2009] IESC 52 [33]., MacMenamin J noted that \\"the constitutional right of access to the courts, while an important right, is not an absolute one\\"Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [45]. The courts must also protect the rights of opposing parties, the principle of finality of litigation, the resources of the courts and the right to fair procedures enjoyed by every party to a litigation.Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [45]. MacMenamin J also noted that, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the courts can assist litigants and their legal representatives \\"by considering the papers in a case beforehand; by sifting through the documentation in order to see what is relevant and what is not; by identifying the issues which truly fall to be decided; and by directing whatever written submissions may be necessary in order to ensure justice is done, effectively and efficiently\\".Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [48]. However, at the same time, litigants and their legal representatives must abide by the rules of the court or run the risk of having conditions placed on the litigation, or being faced by a more radical sanction such as wasted costs orders, a postponement of proceedings or a dismissal of those proceedings for abuse of process.  Conclusion  While the Supreme Court agreed with the order made by the High Court judge that the case be transferred to the non-jury list, MacMenamin J also noted a residual concern that \\"justice be seen to be done\\".Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [44]. As a result, the Supreme Court set aside only the part of the High Court judgement and order where costs had been awarded against the appellant in the appellant's absence.Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [44]. Noting that the Supreme Court had given the appellant \\"an extraordinary degree of latitude\\",Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [44]. MacMenamin J sent back the remainder of the proceedings to the High Court to be dealt with as a non-jury case.Tracey, T/A Engineering Design & Management v Burton [2016] IESC 16, [55].

Daniel Godfrey (4 September 1831 – 30 June 1903) was a bandmaster, composer and arranger of compositions for military bands. He was for many years bandmaster of the Grenadier Guards. Life He was born in Westminster in 1831, eldest of four sons of Charles Godfrey, bandmaster of the Coldstream Guards for fifty years. His eldest brother, George William Godfrey, was well known as a playwright. Daniel Godfrey was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, where he subsequently became professor of military music and was elected a fellow. In his early days he was a flute player in the orchestra of Louis-Antoine Jullien and at the Royal Italian Opera. In 1856, on the recommendation of Sir Michael Costa, he was, through the influence of the Prince Consort Albert, appointed bandmaster of the Grenadier Guards. One of his first duties was to play into London the brigade of guards returning from the Crimean War. In 1863 he composed his \\"Guards\\" waltz for the ball given by the officers of the guards to the Prince and Princess of Wales, later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, on their marriage. This became popular, as did his \\"Mabel\\" and \\"Hilda\\" waltzes. He was also successful as an arranger of compositions for military bands. Godfrey made a tour with his band in the United States in 1876, in celebration of the centenary of American Independence. It was the first visit of an English military band since the creation of the republic, and a special Act of Parliament had to be passed to authorise it. At the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, he was promoted second-lieutenant – the first bandmaster who received a commission in the army – and he was decorated with the Jubilee Medal. In 1891 he reached the age limit of sixty, but his period of service was extended for five years. He retired from the army on 4 September 1896, with the reputation of England's leading bandmaster. Subsequently he formed a private military band which played at the chief exhibitions in England, and with which he twice toured America and Canada. He died in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, on 30 June 1903. Godfrey married in 1856 Joyce Boyles, and they had two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Dan Godfrey (1868–1939), became a successful conductor.

Amaury was the eldest son of Simon III, lord of Montfort-l'Amaury and count of Évreux, and his wife Matilda. On Simon's death in 1181, the Montfort inheritance was divided. Amaury retained the county of Évreux and lands in England, but his younger brother Simon (IV) inherited Montfort in Île-de- France. Amaury was also related by marriage to Saher de Quincy, who was in Évreux in 1181 to witness an act of Amaury's.Melissa A. Pollock, Scotland, England and France After the Loss of Normandy, 1204–1296: ‘Auld Amitie’ (Boydell, 2015), p. 43. Amaury married Mabel, the eldest daughter and heiress of William fitz Robert, Earl of Gloucester, and Hawise de Beaumont. They had a son, Amaury IV (VI). Although Amaury had a clear claim to the earldom after William's death in 1183, it was occupied by King Henry II. Likewise, there is no evidence that any of William's men ever attached themselves to Amaury's retinue so long as the earldom was controlled by the king. Amaury died on the Third Crusade sometime between 1187 and 1193, probably in 1191. The obituary of the Cathedral of Évreux mentions his death right after his father's under March 13 without naming the year, specifying that he left the church forty solidi.Rerum Gallicarum et Francicarum Scriptires, tomus XXIII, Ex Obituario ecclesiæ Ebroicensis, p. 461 His son Amaury was still a minor at his accession and seems never to have actually ruled in Évreux, which was seized by Philip II of France in 1199.

City Harvest feeds over 12,000 Londoners a day with fresh, nutritious, surplus food from a myriad of food producers. History City Harvest London's first last-mile food rescue organisation. The founders, including Laura Winningham (CEO) began the organisation to address high levels of unused, but perfectly edible, food surpluses that were being wasted by food businesses across London. The model was originally based on other international food rescue organisations, but was quickly adapted to suit the London city-scape. Since its founding City Harvest has delivered over 5,000,000 meals worth of food to Londoners in need. Goals The goal of City Harvest London is to put surplus food to use in a sustainable way by distributing it to over 300 organisations around London that feed the hungry. Using a fleet of refrigerated vans, City Harvest collects in-date surplus food from supermarkets, restaurants, manufacturers, caterers (including those running at exhibition centres such as Kensington Olympia), and other food businesses, and distributes it to community programmes in their network. The charity claims to provide a solution to hunger, malnutrition, food insecurity, food waste, and greenhouse gas emissions. The charity provides fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, poultry, and other products to organisations across London serving free meals to vulnerable individuals. Some of the organisations they work with include FoodCycle, The American Church Soup Kitchen, St Mary The Boltons and St Andrew Holborn, among 300 others. City Harvest also works to create research on the scope of food poverty and food waste in London, statistics which are not yet tracked on a governmental level. Through their research, City Harvest has calculated that 9 million meals are needed per month to alleviate food insecurity in London. Achievements In April 2018, the organisation delivered its two millionth recycled meal. By March 2019, it had served 5 million meals, and prevented 6,200 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

Pre-1940 Before World War II, the United States dealt directly only with the former American colony of Liberia, the independent nation of Ethiopia, and the semi-independent nation of Egypt. Liberia U.S. relations with Liberia date back to 1819, when the Congress appropriated $100,000 for the establishment of Liberia. The settlers were free blacks or freed slaves who were selected and funded by the American Colonization Society (ACS). The religious ethos and cultural norms of the ACS shaped Afro-American settler society and determined social behavior in 19th- century Liberia.Amos J.

The Methodist Episcopal Church sent black ministers as missionaries to Liberia. Although they could identify with the local population on a purely racial basis, the nature of their religious indoctrination caused them to view the Liberians as inferiors whose souls needed saving.Eunjin Park, \\"Between Two Worlds: Identity Problems of Nineteenth-Century Black American Methodist Missionaries To Africa\\" Miguk-sa Yongu (2002) Vol. 16, pp 111-131. Under Republican President Abraham Lincoln, The United States officially recognized Liberia in 1862, 15 years after its establishment as a sovereign nation, and the two nations shared very close diplomatic, economic, and military ties until the 1990s. The United States had a long history of intervening in Liberia's internal affairs, occasionally sending naval vessels to help the Americo-Liberians, who comprised the ruling minority, put down insurrections by indigenous tribes (in 1821, 1843, 1876, 1910, and 1915). By 1909, Liberia faced serious external threats to its sovereignty from the European colonial powers over unpaid foreign loans and annexation of its borderlands. President William Howard Taft devoted a portion of his First Annual Message to Congress (December 7, 1909) to the Liberian question, noting the close historical ties between the two countries that gave an opening for a wider intervention: :\\"It will be remembered that the interest of the United States in the Republic of Liberia springs from the historical fact of the foundation of the Republic by the colonization of American citizens of the African race. In an early treaty with Liberia there is a provision under which the United States may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this provision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States to Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend assistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence the Commission was sent across the ocean on two cruisers. In 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (America, Britain, France and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues for the next 14 years, until 1926. American administration of the border police also stabilized the frontier with Sierra Leone and checked French ambitions to annex more Liberian territory. The American navy also established a coaling station in Liberia, cementing its presence. When World War I started, Liberia declared war on Germany and expelled its resident German merchants, who constituted the country's largest investors and trading partners – Liberia suffered economically as a result. In the largest American private investment in Africa, in 1926, the Liberian government gave a concession to the American rubber company Firestone to start the world’s largest rubber plantation at Harbel, Liberia. At the same time, Firestone arranged a $5 million private loan to Liberia.R.J. Harrison Church, \\"The Firestone rubber plantations in Liberia.\\" Geography 54.4 (1969): 430-437. onlineGeorge Dalton, \\"History, politics, and economic development in Liberia.\\" Journal of Economic History 25.4 (1965): 569-591. online In the 1930s Liberia was again virtually bankrupt, and, after some American pressure, agreed to an assistance plan from the League of Nations. As part of this plan, two key officials of the League were placed in positions to ´advise´ the Liberian government.W.E.

These formal relations included a grant of Most Favored Nation status, and were good up to the Italian occupation in 1935. Emperor Haille Sellasse and President Nixon in 1969. Italy invaded and conquered Ethiopia 1935, and evaded League of Nations sanctions. The United States was one of only five countries which refused to recognize the Italian conquest. During World War II, British forces expel the Italians and restored independence to Ethiopia. In January 1944, when President Franklin Roosevelt met personally with Emperor Haile Selassie in Egypt. The meeting both strengthened the Emperor's already strong predilection towards the United States, as well as discomforted the British who had been at odds with the Ethiopian government over the disposition of Eritrea and the Ogaden.John Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), pp. 159f. In the 1950s, Ethiopia became a minor player in the Cold War after signing a series of treaties with the United States, and receiving $282 million in military assistance and $366 million in economic assistance in agriculture, education, public health, and transportation. In 1957, Vice President Richard Nixon visited Ethiopia and called it \\"one of the United States' most stalwart and consistent allies\\".U.S. Requests for Ethiopian Bases Pushed Toledo Blade, March 13, 1957 The economic aid came through Washington's \\"Point Four\\" program and served as a model for American assistance to the newly independent African nations. The original goal of \\"Point Four\\" was containing the spread of communism, which was not a major threat in Africa in the 1950s. More broadly it served as a political project to convince Africans that it was to their long-term interest to side with the West. The program sought to improve social and economic conditions without interfering with existing political or social order. Egypt Trade and cultural relations date back to the late 19th century. the Presbyterians and other Protestant organizations sponsored large-scale missionary activity. Small numbers of Egyptians converted to Christianity. Influential circles in the United States gained an increased awareness of the social and economic conditions in Egypt. One major impact was bringing modern educational methods to Egypt, which the local officials and British had largely ignored. The flagship institution was the American University in Cairo, which offered all classes in Arabic, and practiced flexible methods that were adopted in Egyptian-sponsored schools when they began to appear in the 20th century.Sahair ElCalamawy, \\"The American influence on education in Egypt,\\" in Allen F. Davis, ed., For Better or Worse: The American influence in the world (1981) Official Modern relations were established in 1922 when the United States recognized Egypt's independence from a protectorate status of the United Kingdom. Britain nevertheless controlled Egyptian foreign affairs, and the United States rarely had direct connections with the Egyptian government. In 1956, the U.S. was alarmed at the closer ties between Egypt and the Soviet Union, and prepared the OMEGA Memorandum as a stick to reduce the regional power of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. When Egypt recognized Communist China, the U.S. ended talks about funding the Aswan Dam, a high prestige project much desired by Egypt. The dam was later built by the Soviet Union. When Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, the Suez Crisis erupted with Britain and France invading to retake control of the canal. Using heavy diplomatic and economic pressure, the Eisenhower administration forced Britain and France to withdraw soon. A major result was that the United States largely replaced Great Britain in terms of regional influence in the Middle East.Peter L. Hahn, The United States, Great Britain and Egypt, 1945-1956 (1991). Others In 1901, the Tuskegee Institute, a state college in Alabama directed by the national Black leader Booker T. Washington, sent experts to the German colony of Togo in West Africa. the goal was to introduce modern agricultural technology in order to modernize the colony, basing its economy on cotton exports.Andrew Zimmerman, 'Alabama in Africa: Booker T. Washington, the German empire, and the globalization of the New South (Princeton UP, 2010). World War II Vichy France controlled much of North Africa. with the British based in Egypt pushing back German and Italian forces, the United States and Britain launched Operation Torch with amphibious landings in Morocco and Algeria in November 1942. After brief resistance, the Vichy French forces switch sides and began to collaborate with the Allies. After some delays, the eastern and western Allied forces met up in Tunisia, and forced the surrender the main German and Italian armies. The Americans then moved on to an invasion of Sicily and in southern Italy.William B. Breuer, Operation Torch: The Allied Gamble to Invade North Africa (1985). Numerous locations in Africa were used in moving supplies that were either flown in via Brazil or brought in by ship. supplies were transshipped across Africa and moved through Egypt to supply the Soviet Union.Arnold Hague, The Allied Convoy System 1939–1945 (2000). Decolonization, 1951 to 1960 All the colonial powers engaged in decolonization in the 1950s, starting with Libya 1951, Sudan, Morocco and Tunisia in 1956, and Ghana in 1957. In 1958 President Eisenhower's State Department created the Bureau of African Affairs under the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs to deal with sub- Sahara Africa. Countries in North Africa were under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. G. Mennen Williams, a former Democratic governor of Michigan, was the assistant secretary of state under President John F. Kennedy. Williams actively promoted and encouraged decolonization. The Kennedy administration also launched the Peace Corps, which sent thousands of young American volunteers to serve in local villages. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) started providing cash economic assistance, and the Pentagon provided funds and munitions for the local armies. Euphoria ended when the Congo Crisis of the 1960s indicated very large scale instability. Kennedy-Johnson, 1961-1969 Whereas Eisenhower had largely neglected Africa, President John F. Kennedy took an aggressive activist approach. Kennedy was alarmed by the implications of Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev's 1961 speech that proclaimed the USSR's intention to intervene in anticolonial struggles around the world. Since most nations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia had already chosen sides, Kennedy and Krushchev both looked to Africa as the next Cold War battleground. Under the leadership of Sékou Touré, the former French colony of Guinea in West Africa proclaimed its independence in 1958 and immediately sought foreign aid. Eisenhower was hostile to Touré, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. However Kennedy and his Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver tried even harder than Khrushchev. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington. Kennedy had a broad vision that encompassed all of Africa; he opened up the White House to receive eleven African heads of state in 1961, ten in 1962, and another seven in 1963. Philip E. Muehlenbeck, \\"Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 19.1 (2008): 69-95. online Geopolitical situation in southern Africa, 1978-79. Jimmy Carter: 1977-81 Historians are generally agreed that President Jimmy Carter, 1977–81, was not very successful when it came to Africa. However, there are multiple explanations available.Franck Gerits, \\"Jimmy Carter in Africa\\" History (2017) 102#351, pp 545-547. The orthodox interpretation posits Carter as a dreamy star-eyed idealist. Revisionists said that did not matter nearly as much as the intense rivalry between dovish Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and hawkish National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Vance lost nearly all the battles, and finally resigned in disgust.Donna Jackson, Jimmy Carter and the Horn of Africa: Cold War Policy in Ethiopia and Somalia 2007) Meanwhile there are now post- revisionist historians who blame his failures on his confused management style and his refusal to make tough decisions.Scott Kaufman, Plans Unraveled: The Foreign Policy of the Carter Administration, (2008)). Along post-revisionist lines, Nancy Mitchell in a monumental book depicts Carter as a decisive but ineffective Cold Warrior, who, nevertheless had some successes because Soviet incompetence was even worse.Nancy Mitchell, Jimmy Carter in Africa: Race and the Cold War (2016) p 688. Reagan-Bush administrations, 1981-1993 The Presidency of Ronald Reagan, starting in January 1981, decided that the Carter administration had largely failed in Africa, and sharply changed directions. It abandon the Carter in emphasis on human rights, and emphasized anti- communism. This meant reversals of policies in South Africa and Angola, and changed the relationships with Ethiopia and Libya, which were pro-Soviet. Carter's policy was to denounce and try to end the apartheid policies in South Africa and Angola, whereby small white minorities had full control of government. Under the new conservative administration a more conciliatory approach was taken by the Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker. He rejected confrontational approaches, and called for \\"Constructive engagement\\" Crocker was highly critical of the outgoing Carter administration for its apparent hostility to the white minority government in South Africa, by acquiescing in the United Nations Security Council's imposition of a mandatory arms embargo (UNSCR 418/77) and the UN's demand for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia (UNSCR 435/78). Crocker came up with a complex multinational peace plan, that he struggled to achieve for eight years. the most essential provision required the removal of Cuba's large, well-armed forces from Angola. The United States would then quit funding the anti-Marxist forces led by Jonas Savimbi, South Africa would pull out of Southwest Africa, allowing Namibia to become independent. And finally the white rulers in South Africa would remain in power but relax their restrictions on the African National Congress. Crocker was finally successful in 1988, and during the George HW Bush administration, 1989 to 1993, the goals were realized.Horace Campbell, \\"Constructive Engagement? Chester Crocker and American Policy in South Africa, Namibia and Angola 1981-1988.\\" International Journal of African Historical Studies (2008): 333-336. online. The Reagan administration mobilized private philanthropic and business sources to fund food supplies to areas in Africa devastated by famine. For example music promoter Bob Geldorf in 1985 produced Live Aid, a benefit concert that raised over $65 million and dramatically raised awareness. US government focused on transportation and administrative issues.Frances Westley, \\"Bob Geldof and live aid: the affective side of global social innovation.\\" Human Relations 44.10 (1991): 1011-1036.

Born in Shoreditch,1911 England Census from 1901 to 1927 Whiting worked as a teacher at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. The sculptor Cecil Thomas was among his pupils. His best known works are war memorials. The Gloucestershire Regiment Memorial, Queen's Road, Bristol was listed in 1977. It commemorates the Boer War and consists of a bronze figure of a soldier on a granite plinth. It was unveiled by Earl Roberts in 1905. The bronze was cast by the Parlanti Foundry of London.The Sphere magazine 1905 page 239 alt=The Gloucestershire Regiment by Onslow Whiting, 1904, Bristol.jpg The Letchworth Cross at Station Place, Letchworth, where Whiting went to live in 1905, commemorates the fallen of the First World War and was unveiled in 1921 by Viscount Hampden. It was listed in 2013. Whiting also created three relief panels for the obelisk commemorating the South African War in Plymouth, on Plymouth Hoe, a gift from Alfred Mosely, the philanthropist who had made his fortune in South Africa. The panel facing north shows the spirited charge of the Devonshire Regiment at Waggon Hill and is inscribed with the words: \\"One point in our position was occupied by the enemy the whole day but at dusk in a very heavy rainstorm they were turned out of the position at the point of the bayonet in the most gallant manner by the Devon Regiment led by Colonel Park. General White's despatch 7 January 1900.\\" Another panel shows the Somerset and Gloucestershire Regiments in action. The last panel carries the inscription: \\"This obelisk is erected by Alfred Mosely to the memory of Christian Victor Prince of Schleswig-Holstein and to the officers, non- commissioned officer and men of the Gloucestershire, Somerset and Devonshire Regiments who fell during the Boer War, 1899-1902. Onslow Whiting. November 1902.\\"http://www.oldplymouth.uk/Plymouth%20Hoe- South%20African%20or%20Boer%20War%20Memorial.htm Whiting carried out another commission for Mosely in 1906 when he created a large bronze plaque to the memory of Mosely's long-standing friend Cecil Rhodes, who died in 1902 at the age of 48. The plaque is fixed to the facade of a terrace of houses from the 1870s which belongs to Oriel College, and marks the house where Rhodes spent the Michaelmas Term of 1881. Rhodes had matriculated in 1873 and returned to South Africa twice during that period, where he established himself in the mining industry and was elected an MP in the Cape Parliament. His tutor persuaded him to return to Oxford, where he sat Finals and took his degree.R. Rotberg (1988) The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power. New York: Oxford University Press, 106. Whiting made an effort to integrate the plaque into the architecture of the terrace and lined it up with the windows to create the effect of another window. The plaque is aedicular in shape and contains a relief portrait bust of Rhodes, with the arms of Oriel College, three lions on a shield above, and below him the inscription, '‘IN THIS HOUSE THE RIGHT HON. CECIL JOHN RHODES KEPT ACADEMICAL RESIDENCE IN THE YEAR 1881. THIS MEMORIAL IS ERECTED BY ALFRED MOSELY IN RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT SERVICES RENDERED BY CECIL RHODES TO HIS COUNTRY.’ Whiting was a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and the Art Workers Guild and an Associate of the Guild of Art Craftsmen. Whiting created many sculpture panels in metal as well as architectural metalwork. A panel entitled St George and the Dragon was exhibited in 1899 at the sixth exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He exhibited a letter-plate entitled Mercury at the exhibition of 1910, where it was for sale for £3 3s. His door knocker Prometheus Bound was shown at the Spring Exhibition of the City Art Gallery, Leeds in 1897 and was for sale by commission in bronze for £10 10s. The sculpture panel A Dream was also shown at this exhibition. Three of his works were published in the journal Academy Architecture and Architectural Review. Field Guns Going into Action (vol. 20 (1901) 85) is a metal relief sculpture showing a vivid battle scene from the Boer War. His Designs for Bell-pushes, Finger-plates, etc. (vol.20 (1901) 87) make creative use of human figures in architectural hardware. A Young Minstrel (vol. 23 (1903) 97) is a three-dimensional sculpture of a boy playing a flute.

On 10 March 2019, Grande America caught fire while traveling the Atlantic Ocean between France and Spain on its route from Hamburg (Germany) to Casablanca (Morocco), and sank into the Bay of Biscay on 12 March. The 27 people on board were rescued by the Royal Navy ship after they abandoned ship on 11 March. After their lifeboat's engine broke down entering the water, a Royal Navy sea boat towed it to safety in a swell. Leading Seaman David Groves, the sea boat coxswain , was later awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his bravery in the rescue. Oil spill An oil spill of about in length and in width began moving towards the French coast line, threatening the areas around La Rochelle, Biarritz and Vendée. The ship was carrying 365 containers, of which 45 contained material deemed to be hazardous, including 10 tonnes of hydrochloric acid and 70 tonnes of sulfuric acid. The ship contained dozens of vehicles that were to be delivered to Brazilian importers, including 37 Porsche vehicles. Four of these were Porsche's last units of the 911 GT2 RS, which went out of production in February 2019. The sinking led to Porsche reactivating the production line for the Porsche 911 GT2 RS, so that these four last units could be delivered to their owners in Brazil. The ship was also transporting dozens of Audi cars, including RS4 and RS5 models. The wreck was located by Island Pride (a vessel leased to Ocean Infinity). It arrived 30 March and started inspecting the wreck site using remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). The ROVs were used to seal light leaks of oil discovered during the inspection.

When O'Shaughnessy started working on the first telegraphic line in India, he made use of Nandy as his assistant. Nandy tested the first line signalling from Diamond Harbour to O'Shaughnessy in Calcutta in a demonstration made to Lord Dalhousie. Nandy later became a line inspector in charge of training signallers. In 1866 he became an assistant superintendent and just before retiring the next year he was given the title of Rai Bahadur on 28 February 1883. Among Nandy's achievements was in the low- cost installation of lines. Using fishing boats he helped lay 7 miles of underwater cable across the river Padma at a very low cost. He also used palm trees as posts when he was given charge to lay down 900 miles through East Barrakur-Allahabad, Banares-Mirzapur-Seonee, and Calcutta to Dacca. The palm tree as a post was later incorporated into the telegraphy manual. He also served as a treasurer for the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1849-50.

When asked if it truly was his \\"finest work yet,\\" Bird responded \\"at some point, all of them are.\\" The album cover was photographed by creative director Amanda Demme. It is a recreation of the 1793 painting The Death of Marat by Jacques-Louis David, which depicts Jean-Paul Marat, a journalist and revolutionary who was assassinated during the height of the French Revolution. The painting was originally chosen so that its dramatic nature (\\"the suffering poet on his deathbed penning his last words with his dying breath\\") would enhance the humorous tongue-in-cheek title of the album. Upon further research, however, Bird found that the painting's historical significance lined up with the political tone of the album.

Flight 296 of China Civil Aviation Airlines (CAAC), a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Shenyang Dongta Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, was hijacked by six Chinese nationals and was forced to land at Camp Page, a US military base in Chuncheon, South Korea.Song Chengyou. History of Sino-Korean Relations - Modern Volume. Beijing: Social Science Press. January 2014. . At the time of the incident, China and South Korea did not have diplomatic relations. The incident contributed to the first official non-adversarial contact between China and South Korea before the establishment of diplomatic relations, which was a turning point in the relationship between the two sides. In the following series of incidents, the mutual hostility between China and South Korea in the process of handling or reporting began to fade, and the goodwill component increased greatly, laying a foundation for the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in the future.ROK Dropː 1983 hijacking of CCA flight 296 to Camp Page Course of events At 10:47 am on May 5, 1983, CAAC Flight 296 took off from Shenyang Dongta Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport. At around 11:32 am, when the plane was flying above Dalian, six armed people led by Zhuo Changren hijacked the flight and ordered the pilot to change route to South Korea.Park Chung-jin.

When the pilot refused, the militants shot him in a leg with a pistol and also hurt the operator, forcing them to proceed as demanded.ASN Aircraft accident Hawker Aviation Safety Net There were 105 passengers and 9 crew members on board the plane.Fang Xiuyu. Post-war Korean Diplomacy and China-Theory and Policy Analysis. Shanghai: Shanghai Dictionary Press. December 2011. At 14ː10 hours, the hijacked plane landed at Camp Page military base near Chuncheon, South Korea. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson immediately issued a communication requesting the South Korean authorities to return the aircraft together with all crew members and all passengers to China's Civil Aviation in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and hand over the hijackers to the Chinese side. Zhuo Changren and other six hijackers filed a request to the Korean authorities to allow them to defect to Taiwan. On the day of the incident, US State Department Deputy Spokesman Longberg informed reporters about the hijacking: two injured crew members were being treated at the US Army 121 Hospital, 99 passengers and the crew members (5 men and 1 woman) were released. Six hijackers have been detained by the Korean authorities. He said that the cooperation between the United States and South Korea will be carried out in accordance with the Hague Convention. Taiwan's World Anti-Communist Alliance Chairman Ku Cheng-kang called South Korea on the same day, claiming that the hijacking incident was purely a political incident and should not be handled in accordance with the Hague Convention, and requested South Korea to send the hijackers to Taiwan. The Government of the Republic of China also immediately formed a special action group ready to go to South Korea to assist in the negotiations. Xue Yu, the ambassador of the Republic of China to South Korea, issued a statement saying that the hijacking was \\"the freedom of the anti-communist people.\\" On May 6, a South Korean government spokesman said that South Korea will handle the hijacking in accordance with the spirit of an international agreement to prevent air hijacking and terrorist activities, and is considering the proposal for direct negotiations between China and South Korea. The Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of South Korea, Jin Cherong, said that Shen Tu, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, had agreed to come to Seoul to handle related matters. Although South Korea and the People's Republic of China did not establish diplomatic relations at the time, the South Korean government properly arranged the crew and passengers on the hijacked passenger aircraft to stay at the Sheraton Hotel in the suburbs of Seoul.Hijacking of jetliner is a windfall for South Korea's relations with China Jaqueline Reddit in The Christian Science Monitor The hotel welcomed the Chinese guests who were hijacked and also offered high-end Chinese, Korean and Japanese dishes. The South Korean Ministry of Transportation and the South Korean Air Force sent senior technicians to inspect and repair the aircraft. On May 7, the Chinese civil aviation working group and crew members headed by Shen Tu were welcomed by the Korean government with a red carpet at the Gimpo Airport in Seoul, and arranged for the Chinese delegation to stay at the Shilla Hotel. At 4:10 pm on the same day, the two sides held their first meeting at the Shilla Hotel. After the talks, Shen Tu and his party went to the hospital to visit the injured crew and visited other crew members and passengers at the Sheraton Hotel. On the day, the Korean side arranged for Chinese guests who had been hijacked to visit Seoul, boarded the Namsan Tower, visited the factories of the department store and Samsung Electronics, and were warmly welcomed by the ROK. On May 8, the two sides reached an agreement: passengers and crew members were to return to China with the delegation on the 9th; the hijacked aircraft would be returned to China immediately after the technical problems were resolved; a seriously injured crew member would stay in South Korea for treatment, and afterwards would return to China. The main difference between the two sides was the handling of hijackers. The Chinese side requested extradition, but the South Korean government refused the Chinese request on the grounds that \\"there have been no extraditions of prisoners in the hijacking incidents occurred in various countries.\\" On the morning, Shen Tu issued a statement in Seoul expressing gratitude to the South Korean side for providing assistance and convenience in handling the hijacking incident. At the same time, he said that the six hijackers were criminals wanted by the Chinese police before the hijacking, and that therefore they should be returned to the Chinese side to be punished, he regretted that South Korea had refused to extradite the hijackers, and reserved the right to further negotiations. At the time of drafting the memorandum, China and South Korea had new differences on the official identity of the signatory. The trip originally scheduled to return on the 9th had to be postponed by one day. The South Koreans argued that Shen Tu was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a representative of the Chinese government, and the Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China was a ministerial- level official. Therefore, the two sides should be reflected in the memorandum of negotiations between the Chinese and South Korean ministers. The Chinese insisted on signing a memorandum in the name of civil aviation authorities, without the need to use the names of the countries. The Chinese also suggested that South Korea's official name be used in the copy of the memorandum retained by the South Korean government, while this detail could be ignored in the copy brought back by the Chinese side. However, South Korea rejected the Chinese proposal on the grounds of \\"ignoring the location of the negotiations\\" as \\"a sovereign state.\\" After the Chinese representatives and the domestic communication, the two sides finally held a ceremony of signing and exchanging memoranda at the Shilla Hotel on May 10. The signatories of the memorandum were respectively Shen Tu representing the People's Republic of China and a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea. In the afternoon of the same day, Shen Tu and his team returned to China on the Boeing 707 plane with 99 passengers and 8 crew members of Flight 296.Dong Xiangrong. South Korea. Beijing: Social Sciences Academic Press. May 2009. At the time of departure, senior Korean officials such as came to the airport to see the plane off. Before leaving, Shen Tu delivered a speech to the reporters. He expressed his gratitude to the South Korean for the assistance and care given to the hijacking. Although the two sides disagreed on the handling of hijackers, both sides agreed that these criminals should be severely punished according to law. Prosecution of the hijackers On May 20, 1983, the local procuratorate of Seoul, South Korea, officially arrested the six hijackers and prosecuted them on June 1 for violating the Aircraft Navigation Safety Act. According to the Hague Convention, the Montreal Convention and the Korean Aircraft Navigation Safety Law, those who hijack an aircraft by means of violence or threats should be sentenced to imprisonment for an indefinite period of seven years or more, and those who kill or inflict injuries during the hijacking should be sentenced to death or indefinite imprisonment. However, under the request of the government of the Republic of China, the local criminal court in Seoul sentenced Zhou Changren, the principal offender, to six years on August 18, and five or four years in prison for the other hijackers. The Chinese side expressed dissatisfaction with this. On August 13, 1984, South Korea pardoned the six hijackers and sent them to Taiwan. Upon arriving Taipei, the six seeks asylum, being hailed as \\"Anti-Communist Hero\\" and they were given financial and lifepath assistance by the Free China Relief Association. In July 1991, Zhuo and Jiang conducted the kidnap and murder activities due to economic difficulties. Zhuo and Jiang were sentenced to the death penalty in 2000. On August 10, 2000, Zhuo and Jiang were executed by firing squad in Toucheng Detention Center. Effect on the relationship between China and South Korea In August 1983, an agreement was reached to allow the civilian aircraft of the People's Republic of China to pass through the flight information zone of the Republic of Korea. It was also the occasion to start exchanges between the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China in non-political areas such as physical education, culture and tourism. Under the influence of formal diplomatic contact, the Korean athletes first participated in the Davis Tennis Cup tournament held in February 1984. In March 1984, the People's Republic of China allowed relatives across the border to interact with each other, and in April 1984, the People's Republic of China basketball team first visited the Republic of Korea. The overall relationship between the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China improved, leading to the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1992.

Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Bempedoic acid blocks an enzyme in the liver called adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, which is involved in making cholesterol. Bempedoic acid was approved for use in the United States in February 2020, and for use in the European Union in April 2020. Medical uses In the US, bempedoic acid is indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in combination with diet and the highest tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who need additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. In the EU, bempedoic acid is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. Side effects Common adverse effects in clinical trials were muscle spasms (3.6% of treated patients, as compared to 2.3% under placebo), pain in the back (3.3% versus 2.2%) or in a limb (3.0% versus 1.7%), gout (1.5% versus 0.4%), and gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea. A less common but more serious adverse effect was tendon rupture in the rotator cuff of the shoulder, the biceps tendon or the Achilles tendon (0.5% versus 0.0%). Interactions Bempedoic acid does not interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver and only weakly inhibits the transporter proteins SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3 and SLC22A7 (the latter possibly being responsible for the increase of uric acid in the blood, and therefore the adverse effect gout). Despite this, the drug increases blood levels of statins. The effect is most pronounced with simvastatin and pravastatin, whose AUC is increased about twofold. No other clinically relevant interactions have been found in studies. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Bempedoyl-CoA, the active metabolite. Coenzyme A is shown in blue. Bempedoic acid is a prodrug. It is activated to the thioester with coenzyme A by the enzyme SLC27A2 in the liver. The activated substance inhibits ATP citrate lyase, which is involved in the liver's biosynthesis of cholesterol upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that is blocked by statins. The substance also activates AMP-activated protein kinase, but this effect is likely not relevant in humans. Pharmacokinetics ESP15228, the (also) active metabolite Following oral intake, bempedoic acid reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 3.5 hours. Food does not affect its absorption. When in the bloodstream, 99.3% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. About a fifth of the substance is reversibly converted by an aldo-keto reductase enzyme to a metabolite (called ESP15228) that is also pharmacologically active in form of its coenzyme A–thioester. Of ESP15228, 99.2% are bound to plasma proteins. Both bempedoic acid and the metabolite are inactivated by glucuronidation of their carboxylic acid groups. Bempedoic acid has a biological half-life of 21±11 hours. Over 95% of the substance are excreted in form of metabolites; about 70% with the urine and 30% with the feces. History In a study, it reduced LDL cholesterol by about 20 mg/dl compared to placebo and had no more side effects than placebo, although a higher percentage of drug receiving subjects dropped out of the study because of side effects (11% vs. 7% under placebo). , its effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been determined; but studies are under way. In January 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the European Union recommended granting of a marketing authorization for bempedoic acid as both a standalone drug (Nilemdo) and as a combination drug with ezetimibe (Nustendi). Bempedoic acid was approved for use in the European Union in April 2020. In February 2020, bempedoic acid was approved for use in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of Nexletol to Esperion Therapeutics. The FDA approved bempedoic acid based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT02666664 and Trial 2/NCT02991118) of 3009 subjects with high LDL cholesterol and known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or HeFH. The trials were conducted in United States, Canada, and Europe. There were two clinical trials that evaluated the benefits and side effects of bempedoic acid. The trial designs were similar. All enrolled subjects were on a low cholesterol diet and taking the highest dose of a statin (drug commonly used to lower cholesterol), for high cholesterol. In both trials, subjects were randomly assigned to receive bempedoic acid or placebo tablets every day for 52-weeks. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given. The trials measured percent change in LDL-C blood levels from baseline to week 12 and compared bempedoic acid to placebo.

Though the basic knot is good, Whaterman seems to have watered down the theme and laced it with so-called commercial elements that prove to be a mismatch\\". Sify stated, \\"The film is poor in imagination, content and visuals and you have non-actors in the lead making it tedious to watch. It requires a lot of patience to sit through this big bore, that lacks basic fundamentals of filmmaking\\". A reviewer rated the film 2 out of 5 and said, \\"The director has come up with an interesting thought but he failed in the presentation and narrative departments.

Together with the painter Raymond Monvoisin she travelled to South America in the late 1840s, becoming a successful portrait painter in Santiago. On returning to France, she exhibited in the Paris Salon from 1860. As an author, from 1846 she published a number of illustrated children's stories. Biography Born on 18 March 1833 in Nogent-le-Rotrou as Claire Pauline Filleul, she was the daughter of the lawyer François Adrien Filleul and Pauline de Pétigny de Rivery, who came from a noble Picard family. After completing her schooling at the Institution Delfeuille in Nogent in 1835, she travelled to Palestine, Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and Algeria, publishing illustrated accounts of her travels. She then studied drawing, painting and lithography under Raymond Auguste Monvoisin and exhibited her first painting at the Paris Salon in 1842. From 1842, she accompanied Monvoisin on journeys to South America for stays in Peru, Chile and Brazil. In 1848, together with Monvoisin, she arrived in Santiago where they opened a studio. Over the next 10 years, Filleul became one of the principal painters in Chile, with notable works such as Una guasa (c.1855). She also coloured photographs in Victor Deroche's studio. She also taught art in Santiago and was awarded a medal for her portraits. On returning to France in 1860, she again exhibited at the Salon. While her pastel paintings of baskets of fruit were highly acclaimed, she also created portraits in oils and gave painting lessons. Several of her books were reprinted, including Récits au coin du feu and La Palestine. Clara Filleul died in Paris on 7 August 1878 but was buried in Nogent-le-Rotrou.

Since Carlson's death in 2011, their act has been continued by Lohner. They were known for their series Active Images, which is regarded as bridging the gap between photography and narrative film, as well as blurring the lines between image and video.  Collaborations with John Cage  Lohner's collaboration with Emmy-Award-winning cinematographer and photographer Van Carlson started in 1989, with the biographical art film Peefeeyatko, an intimate music portrait of American composer Frank Zappa. It was the first time that Zappa had allowed a film crew to study him during compositional work, actually filming the first moments of a new compositional process. The film is described as featuring \\"a very unique look at Frank Zappa and his work.\\" Their encounter and subsequent work with esteemed composer John Cage was highly influential for Lohner and Carlson's lifelong artistic partnership. These collaborations include the acclaimed monochrome art film One11 and 103 in 1992, directed by Lohner and photographed by Carlson. One11 is the only feature-length film production Cage was ever involved in. It has no plot and consists of black-and-white images depicting a composed and chance-determined play of electric light, accompanied by Cage's orchestra piece 103. Described as an \\"abstract study in light and shade,\\" it was completed in 1992 shortly before Cage's death. One11 received positive reviews from film and music critics, with Palm D'Or-winning filmmaker Louis Malle calling it \\"very strong, very daring, and finally completely mesmerizing.\\" Gramophone magazine stated that the production was \\"a splendid project carried out with dedication by all concerned\\" and noted the \\"remarkable quality of these uniquely pure visual images, studies in light ranging from total black to total white,\\" while The Wire commented, \\"what an extraordinary valedictory throw of the dice.\\" The film originally aired on German television and has been presented at various theatrical venues and exhibitions since its premiere in September 1992. After Cage died in August 1992, Lohner and Carlson paid homage to the musician with the meticulously \\"composed film\\" The Revenge of the Dead Indians, featuring artists such as Dennis Hopper, Matt Groening and Yoko Ono. The production is a tribute to Cage, his thoughts, music, and influence, and has been described as \\"an unexpected and fascinating combination of intellectual thought, viewpoints and opinions.\\"  Active Images  In 1995, Lohner and Carlson's audio-visual composition Raw Material, Vol. 1–11 was shown for the first time. This installation was exhibited throughout Europe, particularly in The Hague, Rome and Berlin. Composed from their archive of hundreds of hours of footage, the installation showed interviews as well as landscapes on eleven monitors, with an equal emphasis on speech, pictures and sounds. Lohner and Carlson's Active Images developed and was first shown at the Galerie Springer Berlin in 2006, titled Raw Material – Portraits and Landscapes. According to Lohner, the idea \\"arose from our love of video photography and from our subsequent despair over the loss of these images when turning them into [an edited] film.\\" Presented on flat displays, the works bridge the recognizable gap between photography and narrative film and thus \\"blur the line between image and video.\\" According to Photography Now, in their video works Lohner and Carlson \\"depict emblematic picture- themes, which underlie a subtle and uncontrolled pictorial movement. In doing so, the artists present a fixed-frame video picture only to release a brief moment of causal action.\\" Lohner said that he and Carlson were intrigued by \\"the culture of the Everyday, to show things that are so-to-say 'hidden right in front of our eyes.' \\" \\"We are interested in the unusual in the common, the extraordinary in the ordinary. We are interested in the road-side peculiarities that swiftly pass by because one is traveling in a car focused on going somewhere else. We try to pay attention to things along the way-side, things that get overlooked.\\" Following Carlson's death in 2011, Lohner has continued the work of Lohner Carlson on his own. Speaking at an exhibition in 2015, Lohner himself described their artworks as \\"visual music.\\" Lohner Carlson's media art has been exhibited at various venues, such as the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, the National Visual Art Gallery of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur and the Mira Art Collection in Tokyo.https://www.galeriespringer.de/wp-content/uploads/Lohner- Carlson_VITA.pdf  Reception  German culture critic Detlef Wolff has called Lohner an \\"unceasingly curious artist capable of looking closely, continuously able to discover the extraordinary in the seemingly ordinary.\\" He said that Lohner Carlson's work rises far above the otherwise often tedious depths of video art and reaches its peak because Lohner and Carlson command dealing with the camera perfectly. Of an exhibition at the Erik Thomsen Gallery in 2012, a review noted that Lohner and Carlson's work combined \\"the best of moving images and photographic approaches. The images are shown on a series of high resolution video panels and provide a poetic and elegant glance at seemingly normal scenes. Yet they succeed in unframing our structured visual perception of reality and moving us out of that perception box, if we look closely enough embracing a meditative patience.\\" Artnews magazine commented that Lohner and Carlson were \\"able to produce extremely meditative scenes, often using the blandest subject matter, such as a flock of geese or sheep aimlessly milling about in high-definition and high-key color.\\" It further said that in some of the works, \\"there is the sense of a landscape brought to life, as the motions of sky and water are captured in tiny increments.\\" The review called the 1990 work Manhattan Yellow Sky with Steam \\"a mesmerizing urban-scape, with yellowed wisps of vapor dancing among towering smokestacks.\\" Additionally, it commented that the \\"moodiest of the lot was Osaka Hotel Room (1991), in which a square picture window, next to a glowing lamp, acted as a kind of screen within the screen, the sky over the city gradually darkening and coming to pulsing, nocturnal life.\\" The review concluded: > \\"If you've ever wished for a movie to stand still so that you might enjoy a > prolonged sequence of pure visual pleasure, these images speak to those > spaces that get swallowed up or lost in the interest of a different kind of > storytelling.\\" Reviewing Lohner Carlson's 2013 exhibition at Galerie Springer in Berlin, which showed a \\"somewhat retrospective look back at the duo's work as well as new films created by Lohner since his partner's death,\\" art publication Blouin Artinfo wrote: > \\"Presented on flat panel TVs encased in brown wooden frames, many of the > works initially trick the eye into thinking they are indeed still images. > [...] For example, in 'Mineo Rooftops' (2010), the Sicilian scene, Lohner > Carlson's steady gaze achieves the narrative sense of place with utmost ease > that a still image might have glossed over in its single shot or that a film > might have presented to forcibly through dialogue or created storyline. […] > 'Istanbul Bridge' (2012), on the other hand, effuses an ever more > globalizing world, and the geopolitical contingencies presented by the > Eurozone. However, there is a sense that none of these connotative readings > of the works is all that important for Lohner or was for Carlson.

The project, currently in design, will transport natural gas from the off-shore gas reserves in the Levantine Basin into Greece, and in conjunction with the Poseidon and IGB pipelines into Italy and other European regions. The pipeline will have a length of approximately 1,900 km, reach depths of 3km, and have a capacity of 10 billion cubic meters per year. Construction of the pipeline is expected to be cost approximately €6 billion (US$6.86 billion). The pipeline is being developed by IGI Poseidon S.A., a 50-50% joint venture between the Greek gas utility DEPA and the Italian gas utility Edison. On 2 January 2020, the EastMed Pipeline accord was signed in Athens by the leaders of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel. On 19 July 2020, the Israeli government officially approved the accord, allowing the signatory countries to move forward with plans to complete the pipeline by 2025. Timeline In 2013 the construction of the EastMed pipeline was designated under European Commission Regulation 347/2013 as a Project of Common Interest and during the 2015-2018 period the Commission contributed more than €34.5 million (US$38.9 million) to complete technical, economic and environmental studies for the project. The Energy Triangle of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel signed an intergovernmental agreement for the EastMed gas pipeline in Tel Aviv on 20 March 2019 in the presence of United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a sign of support from Washington for the project. American interest on the pipeline is explained by Washington's demand that its European partners maintain a diversification policy of their energy imports. The pipeline will diversify European gas supplies and lessen dependence on Russian Natural Gas. In April 2019, the European Commission labeled the EastMed pipeline as a Project of Common Interest, having contributed €34.5 million (US$38.9 million) to complete technical studies for the project. On 7 May 2019, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte stated, at an event near Rome, that Italy will oppose the construction of Poseidon pipeline; the last section of EastMed connecting Greece and Italy via the Adriatic Sea, putting the entire project under consideration. However, on 1 January 2020, it was reported that the Italian Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli had sent to his Greek counterpart a letter of support for the EastMed pipeline, thus reinstating the backing of Italy for the project. On 2 January 2020, the accord to construct the pipeline was signed in Athens by the leaders of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel. Cypriot President Nikos Anastasiadis and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu characterised the accord as \\"historic\\". The accord includes provisions for ensuring the security of the pipeline and a common tax regime. The Israeli government approved the accord on 19 July 2020, allowing the project to move forward. Following a final investment decision between the countries in 2022, construction of the pipeline is scheduled for completion by 2025. Route The pipeline will connect the Leviathan (Israel) and Aphrodite (Cyprus) gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean to Europe. The pipeline will begin in the Levantine Basin and make landfall in Cyprus, where a compressor station will be located. From Cyprus, the pipeline will continue west for approximately 700 km, reaching depths of 3 km, and make landfall in eastern Crete. A compressor station on Crete will enable the supply of natural gas to the island. From Crete, the pipeline will continue northwest and make landfall in the eastern Peloponnese, near the village of Agios Fokas. The pipeline will cross the Peloponnese in a NW direction, cross the Gulf of Patras, and continue along western mainland Greece, ending in the Thesprotia region. From there, the proposed Poseidon pipeline will connect to Italy. Turkey has stated that they are strongly opposed to the pipeline project, claiming to have been intentionally excluded. The final signing of the project came in a period with Turkish exploration in the area and shortly after the signing of the EEZ agreement between Turkey and Libya. EastMed Gas Forum In January 2019, seven energy ministers in the region penned a deal to set up the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. Total S.A., Eni and Novatek and Exxon have signed exploration and production agreements with the relevant governments. Turkey is referred to being the exception to regional tranquility. The current state members of the group are: Egypt, Cyprus, Israel, and Greece. Representatives of Palestine and Jordan have attended the meetings of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. In January 2020, France and the United States asked to join the Forum, as a member and permanent observer respectively.

History Maderas del Carmen In 1933, the Chamber of Commerce in Alpine, Texas, commissioned a landscape architect to design an international park for the Big Bend region. In 1935, a U.S. Senator from Texas wrote to U.S. President Roosevelt proposing an international park overlapping the U.S.–Mexico border. In 1935, or 1936, the U.S. and Mexico established a commission to establish Big Bend International Park. In 1938, the Dallas Morning News reported on proposals for a Big Bend International Peace Park. In June 1944, Big Bend National Park came into being. That same month, U.S. President F. D. Roosevelt wrote to Mexican President Manuel Ávila Camacho expressing a desire for the area on both sides of the Rio Grande to form one great international park. President Camacho agreed with Roosevelt's aim. After Roosevelt died, U.S. President Harry Truman resumed talks with Mexico. In the 1950s, Mexican efforts stopped short of protecting the entire area envisioned, and talks stalled. In his 1951 essay Chihuahua as We Might Have Been, J. B. Jackson argued for mutual co-operation to restored continuity between the ecosystems either side of the border. In 1983, Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado signed an agreement with U.S. President Ronald Reagan to protect, improve and conserve the environment along the border. In 1994, the Maderas del Carmen protected area was established in Mexico, as was Mexico's Santa Elena Canyon. In 2000, Cemex established an additional borderland conservation project. In 2009, Mexico made its side of the Rio Grande and the Ocampo Flora and Fauna south of Big Bend National Park into protected areas. In May 2010, Mexican President Felipe Calderon U.S. President Barack Obama signed a joint statement pledging both countries' support for cross-border wilderness protection. In October 2011, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Mexican Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Juan Rafael Elvira Quesada outlined the Cooperative Action for Conservation in the Big Bend/Rio Bravo Region, a plan already underway that identified \\"the next steps for the continued coordination between the two countries in the protection and preservation of the transnational Big Bend/Rio Bravo region – North America's largest and most diverse desert ecosystem.\\" Name Over the decades, a number of different names have been proposed for the park, including \\"Big Bend International Peace Park\\", \\"Big Bend International Park\\", \\"US-Mexico International Park\\", \\"Big Bend-Rio Bravo Binational Natural Area\\", and \\"Big Bend-Rio Bravo Natural Area of Binational Interest\\".

History After the Netherlands split into Calvinist and Catholic areas, Flemish artists were keen to revive Catholic motifs and traditions through their paintings. Craesbeeck painted this oil on canvas circa 1650. The painting was featured on the dust jacket of an edition of the novel Generation \\"П\\". Description Artists and authors have long represented the temptation of St. Anthony in their art. Many homages to Bosch's Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony were made, of which Craesbeeck clearly draws inspiration. A large screaming head dominates the painting, spewing forth many devils as a metaphor for evil thoughts given physical form. It has an open forehead which contains a miniature artist. This use of a human head as a container is likely derived from Bosch's iconography. St. Anthony is seen in the front of the painting, sitting in a shelter and holding the Scriptures to fortify himself. The sea in front of him washes up a variety of evil spirits and other temptations.

The Global Positioning system broadcasts a date, including a weekly counter that is stored in only ten binary digits. The range is therefore 0–1023. After 1023 the internal value \\"rolls over\\", changing to zero again. Software that is not coded to anticipate the rollover to zero may stop working or could be moved back in time by 20 or 40 years. GPS is not only used for positioning, but also for accurate time. Time is used to accurately synchronize payment operations, broadcasters, and mobile operators.  1999 occurrence  The first rollover took place midnight (UTC) August 21 to 22, 1999, when GPS Week 1023 advanced and rolled over to 0 within the counter. NavCen issued an advisory prior to the rollover stating that some manufacturers have not fixed the issue. Due to relatively limited commercial and consumer use of GPS during the 1999 rollover, disruption was minor.  2019 occurrence  The second rollover occurred on the night of April 6 to 7, 2019, when GPS Week 2047, represented as 1023 in the counter, advanced and rolled over to 0 within the counter. The United States Department of Homeland Security, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and others issued a warning about this event.  Effects  Products known to have been affected by the 2019 rollover include Honeywell's flight management and navigation software that caused delays for a KLM flight and cancellations for numerous flights in China because the technicians failed to patch the software. Furthermore, the New York City Wireless Network (NYCWiN) crashed.

The first meeting of the grouping is believed to have been attended by almost a third of Labour MPs. Its convener is MP Darren Jones.  History and ideology  The group was set up following defections from the Labour and Conservative parties to form the centrist, pro-European parliamentary grouping the Independent Group (TIG). Watson set up Future Britain to prevent further defections from the party. Notable individuals in the group include former Labour leader Lord Neil Kinnock and John Prescott as well as leading Blairites and Brownites, including Lord Peter Mandelson, Lord Andrew Adonis, MP Yvette Cooper, Lord David Blunkett, MP Pat McFadden, Lord Stewart Wood, Hilary Benn and Lord Peter Hain. Since the resignation of a few Labour MPs to form TIG, and 18 February 2019 registration, Future Britain's parked-website (www.futurebritaingroup.co.uk/) just says 'Coming Soon'. It was registered 19 days before Watson publicly named the group. Additionally, in what was seen as an attack on Jeremy Corbyn and the left wing of the party, Watson argued that Labour's front bench should be reshuffled to accommodate \\"social democratic and democratic socialist traditions\\" of the Labour Party. It seeks a broad church/big tent approach to the party. Mandelson described the group as a \\"coming together of the TB-GBs\\", a reference to the long standing divisions between those loyal to former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the New Labour era. Kinnock said the group was set up to promote \\"democratic socialist values\\" and \\"achievable, possible and affordable policies\\". Over 150 Labour MPs and Lords attended the group's launch, including 14 members of the Shadow Cabinet and 13 former cabinet members. Although Jones as convener denies allegations of factionalism, or that it was \\"a Labour equivalent of the Tory European Research Group\\", the group has been called a \\"new faction\\" of deputy leader Tom Watson. The Times noted that there were \\"fears in the Labour high command that Mr Watson is in effect establishing a party within a party\\". However, Jones denied these claims.

It carries Nay Pyi Taw and Pinlaung Roads. The Leinli Bridge is the highest suspension bridge in Myanmar. History The Leinli Bridge was completed in 2010 at a cost of $3.476 million in foreign currency and an additional 14,500 million kyats. Before the bridge was built, Merchants from Naypyidaw, southern, and western Myanmar who wanted trade with the Shan and Pa'O farmers and ethnic tribes in the fertile Pinlaung Township were required to go up and around the dangerous roads of Elephant Mountain (Sin Taung) and cross the Paung Laung River by boat. To unite the areas and ease travel and commerce, Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council contracted P.T.Waagner-Biro Indonesia together with Supreme Group of Companies to erect the bridge over the Paung Laung River. They chose a spot at mile post No. 42/ 5 on Nay Pyi Taw- Pinlaung Road near Leinli Village of Pinlaung Township, in Southern Shan State The bridge, designed by the People’s Republic of China, was finally open to the public on 5 November 2010. The bridge is 1760 feet long with 1000 feet long main bridge and approach bridges each 380 feet long. The 274- feet-high- bridge was built at a cost of 3.476 million in foreign currency plus K 14,500 million. The motor way is 28 feet wide flanked by three feet wide pedestrian. The bridge can withstand 75- ton loads. Detail Difficult geologic and environmental conditions at the bridge site as well as a demanding construction time schedule restricted construction of the bridge. The main truss of the bridge utilizes a Warren truss with vertical members. In addition, the vertical tension-compression bearings are arranged at both ends of the truss. The towers are of the inward inclined portal frames, of which the lower tower columns are concrete and the upper columns are steel box columns. The anchorage blocks are gravity blocks and each main cable is made up of 24 nos.of 91-φ5.2 mm galvanized high-strength parallel steel wire strands. The bridge was constructed via truck crane lifting, cable-supported hoisting, and installation on scaffolding.

Early life Shohei Otomo was born in 1980 and grew up in Tokyo. He is the son of manga artist Katsuhiro Otomo and his wife, Yoko. Starting at three or four years old, Otomo began drawing every day. He always envisioned that he would become an artist. His father did not give him drawing advice or lessons, and Shohei unsuccessfully tried to avoid being influenced by his artistic style, saying, \\"I had no intention of being influenced by my father, but now I see the influence in my work.\\" Career Medium Shohei Otomo studied oil painting while he attended Tama Art University, but switched to ballpoint pens to create ink art, as oil paints are expensive. He prefers ink pens to pencils, as pencils left a silvery finish he found undesirable. He uses \\"ordinary ballpoints that you can buy anywhere for about 80 yen\\". Additionally, he uses permanent markers for coloring in objects. He creates the drawings on paperboard, though, at one gallery exhibition in Japan, he applied acrylic paint to a human model in a live sketching session. He spends up to a month on an illustration. A 2017 exhibition in Australia marked his first use of sculpture: He designed a sumo wrestler, which he then illustrated with tattoo-like graphics. Inspiration and symbolism Otomo's work blends references to ukiyo-e, a kind of traditional Japanese art, and clichés that the rest of the world has about Japan. The works often contain tension between opposing concepts, such as traditionalism and progress, the Eastern and Western worlds, or order and chaos. His work is inspired by stress of Tokyo, a city he finds \\"suffocating\\". Style Otomo's illustrations are described as hyperrealistic with cyberpunk elements. When including human figures in his art, he tends to cover their eyes with goggles, justifying this by saying, \\"if you show the eyes, the character’s presence overwhelms the picture\\".

It stars Emile Hirsch, Deborah Francois, John Cusack, Danny Webb, Tim Ahern and Sam Louwyck. Saban Films released the film on March 15. Plot A man (Emile Hirsch) enters a church a with a gun. A shot is heard after some Bible verse is read. The man is the town's undertaker and attends a funeral service. He then attends a church service where the preacher claims that the congregation regrets banning alcohol, gambling and prostitution in order to make it a \\"Christian\\" town. After church the man talks with his friend Ed who offers to babysit his kids if he ever needs. The man and his family enter a store where his son asks if he wants a gun, to which he replies he has a rifle. Meanwhile, a strange man enters and grunts aggressively at the storekeeper and stares at the man's wife. Back at home, the man and his wife discuss how they never made it to California (their goal) and the man wishes to move on now that the \\"Christian\\" town has quieted down. His wife refuses to leave. In the middle of the night, three men approach and ask for a man named Bill Crabtree. Though he gives the men directions, they demand that he go with them. He takes the men to Bill's wife's house because Bill left town. The man reveals that he is a bounty hunter looking for Bill. Afterward, he asks to be taken to the saloon where he learns that the preacher demanded the innkeeper stop serving alcohol or he would burn the saloon down. Over a drink, the men introduce themselves as Dutch Albert (John Cusack), Dumb Dumb (whose tongue is cut out) and Sicily, an Italian man who does not speak English. The man introduces himself as Patrick Tate, an Irish immigrant. Dutch claims that he understands how it feels to be an outsider like Patrick, an Irish Catholic. Since the innkeeper does not have any food, the men return to Patrick's house where his wife, Audrey, makes a meal for them. Dumb Dumb (the man from the store) leers at her. After the meal, Dutch returns to the innkeeper and buys his hotel to turn it back into a saloon. One month later, it is in full swing with gambling and whores. The innkeeper (Jim Emmett) goes to get Patrick because a man \\"accidentally\\" died in the saloon. The sheriff is suspicious, but everyone is silent when asked what happened. At the funeral, the preacher accuses the sheriff of dereliction and demands justice. That night, Dutch wakes Patrick and requests two coffins. He takes Patrick to a dugout hole where he kills Bill Crabtree and one other man. Patrick is beginning to make more money than usual due to the string of deaths. At the saloon, Dutch cleans out a young man in cards who cannot pay his debt. When Dutch refuses to let him leave, he pulls a gun, so Dutch kills him. He claims to have killed the boy in self-defense, and no one says otherwise. Everyone hears the gunshots across the street in the church and goes to see the body; the sheriff is increasingly agitated with Dutch but can do nothing. Later, back at the store, Dumb Dumb follows Audrey inside and touches her face. He grunts unintelligibly but appears to say \\"I love you\\" before leaving in shame. When Audrey tells Patrick, he claims no harm will come to her. Mrs. Crabtree goes to see Dutch at the saloon and offers to work as a whore because she is starving. Dutch says he will take her and the daughter, but not her alone, as whores. At Patrick's house, a wagon goes by and a couple claims they are headed to California. They ask where the saloon is. Shortly after leaving, Patrick hears gunshots, and finds the man dead in the street, presumably killed by either Dumb Dumb or Sicily. After preparing the body, he gives his children candy and his wife a new dress, but she refuses because it is fancy and she will look out of place. Offended, he goes into town with his friend and has a drink in the saloon. He has a tense encounter with Dutch, but a shot is heard upstairs - Mrs. Crabtree's daughter couldn't handle being a whore and shoots the man who paid for her. Patrick is commissioned to build a gallows to hang the girl, and his wife says if he does it he is guilty for her death. They argue about how they have no place in the village, but Patrick wants to stay because of the money he is making off of the murders. The next day, the girl is hung. Dumb Dumb follows Audrey home and stalks her into the back yard, brandishing a knife, but before he can get to her Patrick comes up behind him and strangles him, hiding the body in the hung girl's coffin. Now realizing the true depths of his depravity, Patrick agrees to leave with Audrey the next day. That night, the preacher awakes and takes a cask of oil across the street and sets the saloon ablaze. Dutch kills him and the sheriff who comes to his defense. Patrick takes up the sheriff's gun but walks away from the encounter. The next day, while he buries the two, Sicily is sent to kill Audrey. She hides the children and readies Patrick's rifle and when Sicily enters, shoots his arm. They fight and she stabs him in the stomach. She takes one of his guns and they shoot each other. Patrick's children retrieve him from the graveyard and he returns home. He asks Ed to take care of his family if he does not come back. Patrick retrieves his money from its hiding place and spends it all on a blunderbuss and pistol. He loads the blunderbuss with nails and two silver coins, which he puts on the dead people's eyes. He enters the church as seen in the first scene, where he finds Dutch and Jim Emmett. Dutch realizes Patrick is now full of only hate, and draws on him. Patrick shoots the blunderbuss into Dutch, who shoots him in the gut, then turns his pistol on Jim, killing him. He walks home and sees his son on the porch, who asks if he is dying. He tells his son that he loves him, his sister and mother and to go get Ed. Patrick remains on the porch and presumably dies. Cast * Emile Hirsch as Patrick Tate * Deborah Francois as Audrey Tate * John Cusack as Dutch Albert * Danny Webb as Preacher Pike * Tim Ahern as Sheriff Parker * Sam Louwyck as Dumb-Dumb * Camille Pistone as Sicily * Antonia Campbell-Hughes as Maria Pike * Paul Reid as Ed * Blake Berris as Fred * Anne Coesens as Mrs. Crabtree * Paul Ronan as Bill Crabtree Production In December 2017, it was announced Emile Hirsch, John Cusack, Deborah Francois, Antonia Campbell- Hughes, Paul Ronan, Danny Webb had joined the cast of the film, with Ivan Kavanagh directing from a screenplay he wrote. In an interview published on Cineuropa prior to its US release, Ivan Kavanagh told Davide Abbatescianni that his main inspiration when writing were ”the frontier photographs from the 1850s onwards. The hardship on the people’s faces was startlingly apparent, and when you listen to the hymns they sang at the time, they are about hardship, the misery of life, and how life will be better on the other side, in Heaven. It is a very sobering and moving view of the founding of America, and of the immigrant experience. I tried to get some of that into the film, as well as paying homage to the westerns I loved as a child.” Release In February 2018, Saban Films acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released in North America on March 15, 2019.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 90% of 21 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.7/10.

History  Following the passing of her mentor from post-menopausal cancer, Loretta Mayer sold her assets and moved into cancer research to learn more about heart disease in women. Mayer holds a B.A. in sociology from the University of California, San Diego and a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Biology/Biological Sciences from Northern Arizona University. In a post-doctoral appointment with the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona, Dr. Loretta Mayer and Dr. Pat Hoyer co-developed a chemical method of inducing peri- and post-menopause in rodents. Mayer later joined forces with Dr. Cheryl Dyer intending to further study post-menopausal mice, but after considerable interest and application requests from colleagues they realized they had created a useful commercial product as a result of their research. Senestech was officially incorporated in 2004. SenesTech was featured on the TV show \\"Brave New World\\" with Stephen Hawking.  Products   ContraPest  Chemical structure of VCD and Triptolide, the active ingredients in ContraPest Senestech's first product, ContraPest®, is a liquid contraceptive designed to reduce fertility in brown and black rats. ContraPest is a form of a birth control or contraceptive, not a sterilant, so a continuous supply is required to maintain reduced populations.

The station began transmitting exclusively online from 23 January 2010, and continued to broadcast this way until beginning FM broadcasting on 4 November 2017. Vectis Radio transmits on FM from Newport Golf Club. History Vectis Radio was founded in 2010 when Ian Mac created a studio for broadcast from The Quay Arts Centre in Newport. Described as a \\"broom cupboard\\", the team of presenters, less than ten in number, then moved to locations such as St Georges Park and studios in Crocker Street and West Street, Newport respectively. They moved into their current home at The Riverside Centre in Newport in 2013. The station's slogan fits inline with their community outreach, as a station 'for the people, by the people'. In 2017, Vectis Radio became a Community Interest Company. FM launch The station applied in October 2015 to Ofcom after the regulators welcomed bids for FM broadcasting by community radio stations in the South of the United Kingdom. The license was granted in June 2016. A crowdfunding period then began to fund Vectis Radio's aim to go to FM broadcasting - launched on air by Manager Ian Mac. Enough funding was secured by this process and by other means to begin the work. In the meantime marketing drive began to promote the Vectis Radio name in time for the FM launch. The station began broadcasting on FM 104.6 on 4 November 2017. The launch took place at their studio in The Riverside Centre, Newport. 4Ps student and presenter Hannah Barker was selected to press the button that commenced transmissions. In Late 2019, Vectis Radio was granted a coverage extension by Ofcom and work is currently under way to upgrade the transmitter to improve the output power. It is hoped this will be complete by Spring 2020. The 4Ps Project In 2012 the station launched a teaching program called The 4Ps Project for people aged 11 – 19 (and up to 25 with additional needs). The project covers four ingredients the station deems required for radio broadcasting: Presenting, Producing, Podcasting and Promoting. The aim of the scheme is to give people the opportunity to broadcast on a local radio station, and to give members and students a chance to put a skill on their CV. In 2018, Vectis Radio won a bronze award at the Community Radio Awards for the project in the Community Development Project of the Year category. The station also picked up a Highly Commended award in the Business in the Community category at the 2019 Isle of Wight Chamber Of Commerce awards.

Background  There are two appeals at hand here, the Toma Adam case and the Florin Iordache case. Toma Adam case will be referred to as \\"the Toma Adam proceedings\\" and the Florin Iordache case will be referred to as \\"the Iordache proceedings\\". The appeals are heard together because of the High Court judgment in 2001. In the Toma Adam appeal, the Applicants claimed that they came to Ireland to seek asylum as they were abused in Romania, they were oppressed of their human rights, and as a result of both of these facts, they were afraid of the same occurrences if they returned to Romania. There was no real evidence presented of either the abuse or the breach of their human rights. The High Court granted them leave to seek judicial review. The applicants were allowed to seek two reliefs: An Order of Certiorari and An Order of Mandamus. Applicants also wanted the Respondents to seek a case against Romania under the law of the European Convention on Human Rights, however, the High Court did not allow this. The Respondents later opposed the applicants and sought two orders: to discharge the High Court's decision to allow a judicial review, and to get rid of the Applicants legal action overall as they make no proper case against the Respondent and it has no serious purpose. O'Donovan J. in the High Court, held that the Court has power to analyse the decision that granted leave to seek judicial review. The Judge also held that it is wrong that all of the Applicants were put together in one case. It was then held that the European Convention on Human Rights does not involve Irish domestic law and the Minister for Justice does not need to apply such law in his actions. Lastly, it was held that there is no proof that the Minister did not take into consideration the actions in Romania or that there was any breach of natural justice. In the Iordache proceedings, Florin Iordache was seeking judicial review on the basis that when he lived in Romania he suffered a lot of abuse and injustice due to his sexual orientation. Laffoy J. in the High Court, allowed the Applicant to seek: An Order of Certiorari, An Order of Mandamus for the Respondents to take into consideration the Applicants wish to stay in Ireland due to asylum, An Order of Mandamus making the Respondents initiate a claim against Romania, and lastly an order to seek damages. In regards to the Iordache proceedings, the High Court held: that the Court has power to analyse the decision that granted leave to seek judicial review just like in the Adam proceedings. It was held that the European Convention on Human Rights does not involve Irish domestic law and the Minister for Justice does not need to apply such law in his actions. Also it was held that there was no proof that the deportation was in breach of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. It was lastly held that making the State to bring a case against Romania was bound to fail as it would go against Article 29.4.1 of the Constitution. The High Court then held that the Applicants legal action should be dismissed overall as they make no proper case against the Respondent and it has no serious purpose. The Judge held that if an appeal of his decision is made to the Supreme Court, then both the Toma Adam's proceedings and the Iordache case should be heard together.  Opinion of the Supreme Court  The judgments were brought by McGuinness J., and Hardiman J. _The Issues_ The first issue at hand is whether a High Court can clear the judgment of another judge in the High Court, which granted leave for judicial review to the Applicant. The second issue is whether in the Toma Adam and Iordache cases, the Applicants made a strong case for judicial review proceedings. _Judgment of Mrs Justice McGuinness_ McGuinness J. firstly agrees with the lawyers who were present in the High Court that there is no precise Irish authority on the matter regarding whether a High Court has the authority to dismiss an order for leave which has previously been given. However, in the case of Adams v DPPAdams v DPP (High Court unreported 12th April 2000), the judge dismissed an order for leave which was granted before. Judge McGuinness referred to the test set out in G v DPP,G v DPP [1994] 1 IR 374 the first part of the test was whether the Applicants had a \\"sufficient interest in the matter\\". The judge explained that at this stage it is unclear with each Applicant as to what is his/her precise interest in the case. The judge agreed with O'Donovan J (High Court judge), that it is not right to have to have such a big group of Applicants put together. Furthermore, Judge McGuinness said that the biggest problem here for the Applicants are parts B) and C) of the test in G v DPP,[1994] 1 IR 347 she stated that if the Applicants affidavit had a specific and strong ground as to why such relief was being sought, then the Applicants would get such relief. McGuinness J. then went on to talk about the affidavits of Mr Pendred (Solicitor). The affidavits regarded the matter of different ways in which the applicants could suffer persecution in Romania. McGuinness J. felt that in this case the affidavits were stated in \\"very general terms\\". She reminded everyone that a judicial review is not another appeal, it is about the procedures that were used to come to a decision. The judge explained that an Applicant, when seeking leave for a judicial review must produce an affidavit that specifically establishes how he/she believes the decision making procedure was wrong. Judge McGuinness contrasted this case with R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Turgut [2001] 1 All ER 719, where \\"1,500 specific pages of specific evidence were submitted to the Court.\\" In this case, on the other hand, the judge could not find whether the facts supported a proper ground for the relief being fought, \\"because neither in the Adam proceedings nor the Iordache proceedings did the pleadings set out any specific evidence that the Minister had failed to have regard to the situation in Romania when considering the position of the Applicants.\\" The judge found that the Applicants did not provide much evidence for their claims and did not put forward a strong case. For these reasons, Judge McGuinness dismissed both appeals and affirmed the orders of the High Court. _Judgment of Hardiman J._ Judge Hardiman, when deciding on the conclusion of the case, looked at whether the Applicants provided a strong, reasonable case, or whether these cases are \\"frivolous or vexatious or doomed to fail\\". Hardiman J., began his judgment by saying that the Applicants did not have strong evidence, they instead are simply claiming that Romania is a place where deportation should not be allowed. These allegations were made by \\"Counsels advice\\", there was no real proof as to why deportation should be disallowed. As for the Adam proceedings, the judge stated that there was nothing presented, to clearly show the individual situations of the applicants. Hardiman J., then explained that although Mr. Iordache had more specific reasons for his application, it was still quite vague. \\"No applicant has made out a credible cause that he or she has an individual fear of persecution.\\" The judge then used the case of Finnucare v McMahon [1990] ILRM 505, to show contract with the case at hand. In the Finnucare case, the Plaintiff showed with strong evidence that he could not be sent back to Northern Ireland. In contrast, the Applicants in this case, apart from Mr. Iordache, did not attempt to show evidence, as Hardiman J., states in his judgment. Mr. Iordache was given permission to seek a case against Romania in the High Court, however, Hardiman J., stated, \\"I consider that no Court has jurisdiction to direct any such order to the executive\\". He also referred to Article 29.4.1 of the Irish Constitution to give source to his statement. He explained that it would be against the Constitution if the Court began proceedings against Romania. If this were to happen, as the judge explained, then the court would be performing a function which is meant for the Government, it would disregard the separation of powers. Hardiman J. concluded that this case had no proper facts, apart from Mr. Iordache's case. He found these proceedings to be \\"frivolous, vexatious and doomed to fail: indeed they are scarcely recognisable as legal proceedings at all.\\" Like in Judge McGuinness' conclusion, Hardiman J. also referred to the case R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Turgut [2001] 1 All ER 719, to contrast with the case at hand. Lastly, Hardiman J. added that he also agreed with O'Donovan J. (High Court), that all of these Applicants should not have had their cases put into one proceeding without having their situations distinguished individually. Hardiman J. dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order of the High Court.

The High Court rejected Callan's appeal that he was eligible for remission. Callan then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found that Callan was indeed serving imprisonment and so by law could request remission of his penalty.  Background  Noel Callan was charged with the capital murder of Garda Sergeant Patrick Morrissey. In 1985 He and the other defendant together was part of a small group of people convicted and sentenced to death for killing on-duty Gardaí. A sentence of death was imposed on him and this sentence was carried out until the President on foot of Article 13 of the Constitution commuted it to Penal Servitude for 40 years. Penal Servitude was abolished in 1997 and changed to imprisonment as per section 11(5) of the Criminal Law Act 1997. Callan took a case arguing that by default of him undergoing a sentence for imprisonment, it entitled him to remission in accordance with the law. He referred to rule 59 of the Prison Rules 2007. The Constitution states that remission is only available in respect of a punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction.Article 13.6°, Bunreacht na hÉireann  Facts of the Case  Callan was approached by a co-worker, Michael McHugh, who asked him for assistance in robbing the Labour Exchange in Ardee. Both men robbed the Exchange and escaped with the money on a motor bike which they later crashed. In escaping the scene, two shots were fired, the first hitting Morrissey in the leg. McHugh then shot the wounded Morrissey in the head at point-blank range. Callan was a distance away from the shooting however he was charged and convicted of the capital murder of Garda Sergeant Patrick Morrissey in 1985. He was charged on the basis that both men were working as part of a joint enterprise or common purpose. This doctrine holds each party criminally liable for all the acts done by the other parties in furtherance of that purpose. Callan denied any involvement in either the robbery or the murder of Morrissey. The Special Criminal Court convicted him of capital murder and his conviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The High Court  The case originated in the High Court (Ireland) in 2011, which dismissed Callan's arguments. Hanna J held that he cannot avail of remission because he was not serving a sentence of imprisonment. In addition he was not entitled to remission under the Prison Rules because his sentence resulted from an order by the President rather than a sentence imposed by the court. The Court held that the power to commute a sentence is an executive power. The Court further held that Callan had not been subjected to unequal treatment or discrimination based on the difference in remission entitlements. Hanna J rejected all of the various constitutional arguments brought forward by the appellant counsel and found in favour of the defendants.  Supreme Court  The State argued the Callan was not entitled to remission for good behavior because he was serving a \\"commutation\\" rather than a sentence. However, the Supreme Court rejected this argument. Hardiman stated, \\"I believe that, in terms of logic, law and language, this is a nonsense.\\" The Court noted that the 1997 law removing \\"penal servitude\\" stated that anyone in jail for it should be considered to be serving a \\"sentence of imprisonment.\\" Furthermore, the court noted that Callan had been convicted of murder through the doctrine of common purpose. Yet the justices pointed out that a plausible defense for Callan was that the common purpose extended to the robbery but not the murder of Morrissey. The court ruled that Callan was eligible for remission based on good behavior.  Conclusion  This case is interesting as it shows the Supreme Court reversing the decision of the High Court. In allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court enabled Callan to be entitled to remission of one quarter of his sentence and perhaps even more in accordance with the law.  Subsequent developments  One case which made reference to Callan was McKevitt v Minister for Justice and Equality & Others.McKevitt v Minister for Justice and Equality, Irish Prison Service, Ireland and Attorney General [2014] IEHC 551; [2015] 1 ILRM 277. Kelly J in this case observed the construction of Rule 59 (2) with specific reference made to the observations of Clarke J in the Supreme Court in Callan. Kelly J agreed with the judgment in Callan that Rule 59 (2) confers a discretionary power on the Minister in relation to granting a greater remission. Another case which made reference to Callan was Byrne (A Minor) v Director of Oberstown School.Byrne (A Minor) v Director of Oberstown School [2013] IEHC 562. In this case Hogan J. held that the case of Callan v Ireland & The Attorney General applied when speaking about the importance of remission in relation to the role it plays in the operation of the criminal justice system.

After settling in New York in 1949, Fluek began her career as an artist, painting and illustrating her memories of life before, during, and after the Nazi invasion. She published two books and is featured in two films, one of which she is the subject of. After her death in 2011, Fluek's daughter, Lillian Fluek Finkler, donated her mother's body of work—over 500 drawings, paintings, photographs, and ephemera—to the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida where it is held as part of the museum's permanent collection.  Early life  Fluek was born Toby Knobel in Czernica, Poland on 20 February 1926. She was the youngest of four children in an Orthodox Jewish family. Her father was a potato and wheat farmer and her family was one of ten Jewish families in a village of about two hundred and fifty families of Polish and Ukrainian heritage. Their home and life were modest—Fluek describes their bathing ritual: \\"One towel was used by six.\\" As a child, Fluek was the only Jewish student in her school and was teased by her classmates as she did not participate in Catholic prayers and could not write while attending school on the Jewish Sabbath (school was six days a week with only Sunday off from class). In the summer of 1941, almost two years after the Russian occupation of Poland, Nazis marched into the village. Fluek and her siblings were briefly jailed for her father's inability to comply with Nazi demands for wheat crops from the Jewish farmers. In the fall of 1942 the family was relocated to the Jewish ghetto in the nearby city of Brody. Fluek and her older sister, Surcie, fled the ghetto under cover of darkness and returned to Czernica, where they survived by hiding in the woods and with the help of their former neighbors. Surcie returned to the ghetto to encourage her parents to flee and her mother left with her. Fluek's other sister, Lajcie, was sick with typhoid, her older brother Aron, was taken to a work camp, while her father chose to remain in the ghetto in hiding. Fluek and her mother were the only two to survive the Holocaust as the ghetto hospital where Lajcie was being treated was burned with the patients still inside, Aron ran from his work camp and was caught by Nazi soldiers, Fluek's father was caught by soldiers after the ghetto was liquidated when he came out of hiding in search of water and food and was executed on the spot, and Surcie was separated from Fluek and her mother and was not heard from again. After the war, Fluek and her mother were sent to multiple displaced persons (DP) camps, eventually making their way to Bad Wörishofen where Fluek's mother was treated in the DP hospital while the pair waited to immigrate to the United States. Fluek met and married her husband, Abraham, in the DP camp before relocating to the Bronx, New York, in December 1949. A year later her daughter, Lillian, was born.  Becoming an Artist  Despite having artistic inclinations as a child, Fluek did not take an art class until she was in her 30s. Her body of work includes paintings, charcoals, sketches, and drawings that largely draw on her memories of her childhood, before the start of World War II, including religious celebrations, but also include portraits of relatives, still lifes, landscapes, and design motifs. Fluek published two memoirs: Memories of My Life in a Polish Village (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1990, ), and Passover As I Remember It (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994, ). Both books are written and illustrated by Fluek, with her daughter, Lillian Fluek Finkler, listed as a contributing author on the latter. Fluek's art was featured in the 1981 documentary film, Image Before My Eyes, and is the subject of the 2008 film, Toby’s Sunshine: The Life and Art of Holocaust Survivor Toby Knobel Fluek, produced by Dr. Rakhmiel Peltz. Fluek created much of her art from memory but used photographs of models as aids. The photographs, including many of herself and some from a trip to Poland to document rural village life, are contained in the artist's personal archive and now reside at the Florida Holocaust Museum in their permanent collection.  Death and Donation to the Florida Holocaust Museum  Fluek died in 2011, predeceased by her husband, leaving her body of work in the hands of her daughter. Lillian Fluek Finkler. Finkler searched for a museum to house her mother's art before deciding on the Florida Holocaust Museum, which had years earlier showcased Fluek's art in a temporary exhibition. Finkler describes her decision to donate the collection to the Museum: \\"I have donated my mother's collection to The Florida Holocaust Museum so that her story would be kept alive, even though she is no longer with us. I am excited that her artwork will be exhibited and shared by The Florida Holocaust Museum in their educational outreach as well as digitally and in museum exhibits. It is important that children, adults, museums and researchers all have access to this unique visual memory of my mother's world. She would have been pleased and honored that her work is being made available to current and future generations.\\" The Florida Holocaust Museum received the donation in 2018 and has begun the work of processing the collection of over 500 pieces of art, documents, and ephemera into its permanent collection, though a date for exhibition has not been set.

Part VII transfers are a common tool used by insurance businesses to address required business transformation in preparation for or in response to Brexit.  Background  Insurance companies based in the United Kingdom can operate in other parts of the European Union under a so called EU passport arrangement for financial services. Under this arrangement, insurance policies for risks elsewhere in the EU, can be underwritten in the UK. With the UK's departure from the EU, insurers would not be able to pay out claims under such policies. According to the Financial Conduct Authority, this could affect 38 million policyholders with policy values of up to GBP 55 billion.  Transfer  Under a Part VII transfer, an insurance company will set up a separate legal entity in an EU country that will service policies with EU clients after Brexit. A submission to a UK court will be made to transfer the book of business to this EU entity. Once approved, clients will need to be duly informed that their business will move. The process usually takes approximately 18 months. Prior to Brexit, 10 such applications were made to UK courts on average per year. Given the volume of transfers in the run up to the date when the UK leaves the EU, there have been reports about delays in court hearings. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) which oversees insurance businesses has proposed increasing the fee it charges companies for such business transfers to GBP 20,000 effective 1 March 2019 given the complexity of the transaction. In a similar fashion, banks use the Part VII transfer framework to move their swap business to EU entities. Approaches and timelines chosen by companies vary given the cost and complexity of the transfer. While some companies have already transferred their business or are in the process of it, others are exploring alternative options. As an alternative to Part VII transfers, some financial institutions have alternatively opted to sign new contracts with clients in their post-Brexit location.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, is the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while Katharine Worlsey is the only daughter and fourth child of Sir William Worsley, 4th Bt., and Joyce Brunner. Engagement The Duke of Kent met Miss Katherine Worsley, daughter of Sir William Worsley, 4th Bt., while he was based at Catterick Garrison near the bride's family's ancestral home, Hovingham Hall. The engagement of the Duke of Kent to Miss Katharine Worsley was announced on 8 March 1961 at Kensington Palace. The Duke presented Miss Worsley with an engagement ring made of an oval sapphire with round diamonds on either side. The wedding The couple were married by The Most Rev. and Rt Hon. Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of York, in York Minster, the \\"Westminster Abbey of the North,\\" according to the Book of Common Prayer. This was the first royal wedding held in York Minster since Edward III married Philippa of Hainault in 1328. Following the service, the couple and their guests returned to the bride's family home, Hovingham Hall, for the wedding breakfast. The newlyweds then departed for their honeymoon at Birkhall on the Balmoral estate. Music The newlywed couple recessed to Widor's \\"Toccata\\" from Symphony for Organ No. 5.

It featured a tight bodice, stiff neckline, and a full skirt with a 15-foot double train. She anchored her white tulle veil with a diamond bandeau tiara which belonged to the bridegroom's late grandmother, Queen Mary.

They have a large surface area relative to their size and high catalytic activity. The exact physical and chemical properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles depend on the different ways they are synthesized. Some possible ways to produce ZnO nano-particles are laser ablation, hydrothermal methods, electrochemical depositions, sol–gel method, chemical vapor deposition, thermal decomposition, combustion methods, ultrasound, microwave-assisted combustion method, two-step mechanochemical–thermal synthesis, anodization, co-precipitation, electrophoretic deposition, and precipitation processes using solution concentration, pH, and washing medium. ZnO is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an energy gap of 3.37 eV at room temperature. ZnO nanoparticles are believed to be one of the three most produced nanomaterials, along with titanium dioxide nanoparticles and silicon dioxide nanoparticles. The most common use of ZnO nanoparticles is in sunscreen. They are used because they effectively absorb ultraviolet light, but possess a large enough bandgap to be completely transparent to visible light. They are also being investigated to kill harmful microorganisms in packaging, and in UV-protective materials such as textiles. Many companies do not label products that contain nanoparticles, making it difficult to make statements about production and pervasiveness in consumer products. Since ZnO nanoparticles are a relatively new material, there is concern over the potential hazards they can cause. Because they are very tiny, nanoparticles generally can travel throughout the body, and have been shown in animal studies to penetrate the placenta, blood–brain barrier, individual cells, and their nuclei. Tissues can absorb them easily due to their size which makes it difficult to detect them. However, human skin is an effective barrier to ZnO nanoparticles, for example when used as a sunscreen, unless abrasions occur. ZnO nanoparticles may enter the system from accidental ingestion of small quantities when putting on sunscreen. When sunscreen is washed off, the ZnO nanoparticles can leach into runoff water and travel up the food chain. As of 2011 there were no known human illnesses resulting from any engineered nanoparticles.

Biography Elisabeth Friederike Wilhelmine Halberstadt was born in Corbach, a small town in the uplands west of Kassel. Carl Franz Halberstadt, her father, was a lawyer employed as a secretary by the Count Reuß. He thought himself a rich man. Before he married he had traveled extensively in Europe and later crossed the Atlantic, acquiring land in America. Becoming homesick, he had returned home, however, and spotted the beautiful young childless widow Maria Christiane Speirmann (born Schmidt) at church. They subsequently married. Maria also came from a wealthy family. However, it subsequently turned out that Maria's father's guardian, having \\"delayed\\" providing proper financial accounts for some years, had been embezzling and spending the family monies. He was imprisoned but the family fortune was not recovered. Finding that they were not, after all, a wealthy family, Carl Franz Halberstadt travelled back to America to sell his possessions there. On the way he was involved in a shipwreck after which he was never seen again. Attempts to obtain details of his presumed death came to nothing. Maria Halberstadt was left to bring up the children alone. She had received an excellent education, but now, despite her aristocratic background and habits, she found herself obliged to live in a state of poverty for which life, up to this point, had not prepared her. Wilhelmine Halberstadt was intelligent and keen to educate herself quickly in order that she might become a teacher which would enable her to bring an income into the family home to support her mother and siblings. Between 1806 and 1812 she was employed as a tutor-governess by the family of Mayor Tesdorpf in Lübeck. The city had for centuries been commercially dynamic and prosperous, but Halberstadt's time there coincided with the French occupation which sources describe as a \\"time of horrors\\" (\\" Schreckenszeit Lübecks\\") After that she returned to live with her mother and attempted to set up her own school in Trier, where by this time her mother was living. In Trier she was by no means \\"an unknown\\". Her (in some ways strangely \\"modern\\") views on women's education had been included in her 1808 publication, \\"Über Würde und Bestimmung der Frauen\\" (loosely: \\"On the dignity and fate of women\\"). The book had earned her the good will of the Roman Catholic church establishment in Trier, which meant that even the bishop backed her. Nevertheless, there was plenty of opposition in the city, which at least one commentator linked with the fact that she was \\"perhaps the only protestant woman in Trier\\". The project nevertheless prospered and for a time she was able to be happy and productive in Trier. Sources are inconsistent as to the date of her mother's death, but after that occurred Halberstadt became engaged to marry the author Karl Borbstädt. He was a former government tax official and had good connections with the Prussian government over in Berlin. The two of them had much in common in terms of their idealism and their belief in improving the human condition. They were committed to inner morality, inner religiosity and the best possible education for children and young people. They shared a grand plan to create a major educational institution, possibly in Berlin. It was not to be. Karl Borbstädt took a trip to Berlin to make administrative arrangements, but he never came back. Instead he suddenly died. Wilhelmine Halberstadt's grief was \\"boundless\\". Once more on her own, she sought to moderate the impact of the bereavement by redoubling her own educational work. The Rhine Province (including Trier) was particularly badly hit by the crop failures of 1816 and 1817. The income from the school fell. Austerity also triggered a growth in inter-denominational strife, which disadvantaged an institution run by a Protestant in a Catholic province. In 1822 Halberstadt decided to close the school. Her intention now was to restrict her teaching activities to private lessons, working for families she knew and trusted. In 1822 she also published a more substantial work on pedagogy, assembling her accumulated experience of teaching into just four volumes. \\"Gemälde häuslicher Glückseligkeit\\" (loosely,\\"Images of Domestic Happiness and Joy\\") was influential among educationists and other opinion formers of the time. Short of funds, she sent a copy to the Russian emperor. Although the book was apparently sent unsolicited, the czar sent her a substantial payment \\"in recognition\\". It was not only the Czar of Russia who had been impressed by her contributions. Frederick William III of Prussia had also become an admirer of her educational achievements in his Rhine Province, and was no doubt aware of her written works. He made arrangements to provide her with a pension, but when she became aware of the king's intentions she quickly wrote to him asking if he would instead be willing to fund her new project. Her plan was to select the most suitable girls from orphanages and train them to become elementary school teachers. Girls from higher social classes were not, she insisted, really suitable for work as elementary school teachers. There are suggestions that Halberstadt had been influenced by the ideas propounded by Swiss educationalist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Her project was timely. The Prussian King had recently appointed the kingdom's first Minister for Education. Halberstadt's project met with approval and the Education Minister, Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein received instructions to look at her proposals sympathetically. Due to ongoing religious disputes in the Rhine Province it was still not possible to pursue the project in Trier, however, and towards the end of in 1822 Halberstadt relocated from to Berlin, where her protestantism was not a particular issue. In he end it was in Kassel that in 1823 she found the opportunity to set up an educational institution for daughters of the wealthy. By this time she had also found time to produce a second edition of her book \\"Ueber Würde und Bestimmung des Weibes, jungen Frauenzimmern gewidmet\\". There was also a new teaching book: \\"Schulbuch, als erste Uebung im Lesen und Denken, nach der Lautmethode. Ein Geschenk für fleißige Kinder.\\" (loosely,\\"Textbook, as a first exercise in reading and thinking phonetically. A gift for industrious children\\"). These two books were both widely welcomed, and the first of them was even translated into French. They provided the foundation for her first educational institution which soon had more than 100 pupils. Still in Kassel, in October 1831 she was able to pull together the money to launch the first \\"Halberstädtsche Free school\\" for poor girls. It thrived, and was taken over by the municipal schools board only in 1876. In 1833 she set up the \\"Halberstädtsche Fräuleinstiftung für vaterlose Töchter\\" (\\"Halberstadt young ladies' foundation for fatherless daughters\\"). The number of educational institutions that she was able to set up grew, with two of them funded from her own resources. In order further to increase the money available to her foundation she also launched a monthly journal in 1835, which appeared in German, French and English, and which she named the \\"Ehrentempel europäischer Classiker\\" (\\"Honoured temple of European classics\\"). She lived long enough to see her foundation grow and flourish. Through her foundation thousands of children were educated, clothed, fed and trained for life. By the end of her life, through the educational institutions she had created and through her writings, she had become famous, able to be mentioned in the same breath as the great Halle scholar-philanthropist and education pioneer August Hermann Francke.

The government of Tanzania and the semiautonomous government of Zanzibar both recognize religious freedom as a principle and make efforts to protect it. The government of Zanzibar appoints Muslim religious officials in Zanzibar. The main body of law in Tanzania and Zanzibar is secular, but Muslims have the option to use religious courts for family-related cases. Individual cases of religiously motivated violence have occurred against both Christians and MuslimsInternational Religious Freedom Report 2017 Tanzania, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The policies and ideology of Ujamaa espoused by Tanzania's first government following independence from the United Kingdom in the 1960s emphasized national unity over religious or ethnic division, and this is reflected by the strong anti-discrimination rhetoric in Tanzania's constitution, which is still in effect as of 2019. While Ujamaa was abandoned as a state project in 1985, and religious discord has risen somewhat since then, academic and NGO sources credit Ujamaa for contributing to a climate of religious freedom and relative social stability in Tanzania.  Demographics  A 2010 Pew Forum survey estimates approximately 61 percent of the population is Christian, 35 percent Muslim, and 4 percent other religious groups. A separate 2010 Pew Forum Report estimates more than half of the population practices elements of African traditional religions in their daily lives. There are no domestic surveys covering religious affiliation. On the mainland, large Muslim communities are concentrated in coastal areas, with some Muslim minorities located inland in urban areas. Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Protestants (including Pentecostal Christian groups), Seventh-day Adventists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. Other groups include Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Bahais, animists, and those who did not express a religious preference. Zanzibar’s 1.3 million residents are 99 percent Muslim, according to a U.S. government estimate, of whom two-thirds are Sunni, according to a 2012 Pew Forum report. The remainder consists of several Shia groups, mostly of Asian descent.  History   Background  Tanzania is made up of two regions, a mainland region on the African continent and the archipelago of Zanzibar, which were unified in the 1960s. The mainland region of Tanganyika was first delineated as part of the partition of Africa in the Berlin Conference in 1884. By contrast, Zanzibar's history as a distinct region goes back to the 13th century, when it was home to Swahili city states. Exact dates for the introduction of Islam to East Africa are unknown, but the first recorded evidence of Muslim presence dates to 830 CE, and significant Islamic city-states were established in Zanzibar and along the mainland coast by the 11th century. These city-states reached their apex in the 14th and 15th centuries, after which they deteriorated following conflict with Portugal in the 16th to 17th centuries. Portuguese control of Zanzibar was brief, as they were deposed by the Omani Empire, which would eventually move its capital to Zanzibar. During the early 19th century, Zanzibar became a significant node in the slave trade, which would not end until the early 20th century. Christianity arrived in Tanganyika in the 19th century in the form of various European missions, and around the same time Sufi missionaries would spread Islam beyond the coastline regions. Both Christian and Muslim practices in Tanzania are heavily influenced by syncretism with older African religious traditions. During the independence movement, both Christians and Muslims played significant roles in the Tanganyika African National Union. Following independence, however, discourse shifted and the Christian and Muslim communities were sometimes presented as being politically at odds.  Early independence and the Zanzibar Revolution (1961–1964)  In 1961, British rule ended in Tanganyika, with Julius Nyerere becoming its first president in 1962, while Zanzibar continued to be a British protectorate ruled by an Arab monarchy. In 1964, the Sultanate of Zanzibar was overthrown in the Zanzibar Revolution. The revolution was accompanied by extreme levels of violence by African revolutionaries against Arabs and South Asians, who were predominantly Muslim or Hindu and were identified with the ruling class of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. The legacy of this event is contested, as the extreme and racially- targeted violence is seen by parts of Zanzibar's society as retaliation for oppression suffered under the Sultanate, which had had a significant African slave trade. The forces perpetrating the violence were led by John Okello, a Christian who believed that it was his duty to liberate Zanzibar from the \\"Muslim Arabs\\", despite the fact that the African population in Zanzibar and the revolutionary Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) were predominantly Muslim as well. Okello's actions and militant Christian beliefs alienated others in the ASP, and he was soon marginalized, stripped of rank and eventually deported.  Unification and Ujamaa (1964–1985)  Following the revolution, Zanzibar merged with Tanganyika to form Tanzania, with Nyerere as president. The ruling elite on the mainland, who were religiously diverse, preferred secular rule, whereas Zanzibar maintained a degree of autonomy and implemented a semisecular state. While Islam was not officially a state religion, it was accorded special status and privileges. In 1967, Tanzania pivoted further to the left politically, and began to promote Ujamaa, a socialist ideology which emphasized freedom, equality and unity as its central principles. The country also adopted a constitution which included strongly worded sections against discrimination, including religious discrimination. Human Rights Watch credits Ujamaa as having been an effective model of national unity, contributing toward Ujamaa's relative stability and social harmony, with the caveat that the emphasis on unity also made it difficult at times to investigate human rights abuses. Tanzania is the only country in East Africa that has not experienced continuous cycles of ethnic, religious or political violence since its independence from colonial rule.  Post-Nyerere (1985–present)  Following Nyerere's retirement from politics after his last term in 1985, the government of Tanzania largely abandoned Ujamaa as its ideology, although as of 2019 the 1977 constitution remains in effect. Since the end of the Ujamaa period, there has been increased contention between Muslims and the government, and to a lesser extent between Muslims and Christians. In 1993 and 1998, tensions rose to the level of violent conflict between Muslims and state security forces, with both incidents resulting in many deaths. Academics have attributed this decline in religious harmony to the collapse of Ujamaa in the sense of both its national-unity ideals and its social-welfare policies, the influence of worldwide increases in religious militancy toward the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, religious revival movements inside Tanzania, and the redefinition of political camps following the liberalization of the economy beginning in the late 1980s. Witchcraft was outlawed in 2015. As of 2019, however, there continued to be witchcraft-associated ritual killings reported, with the police arresting those suspected of involvement. While religious violence is rare, it does occur. In 2017, there were three instances of vandalism and property destruction, including arson, against religious buildings and clergy.  Legal framework  The constitution of the union government of Tanzania and the constitution of the semiautonomous government in Zanzibar both prohibit religious discrimination and provide for freedom of religious choice. The law prohibits the formation of religious political parties. The law also prohibits any person from taking any action or making statements with the intent of insulting the religious beliefs of another person. Anyone committing such an offense is liable to a year's imprisonment. The government does not designate religious affiliation on passports or records of vital statistics. Police reports must state religious affiliation if an individual will be required to provide sworn testimony. Applications for medical care must specify religious affiliation so that any specific religious customs may be observed. The law requires the government to record the religious affiliation of every prisoner and provide facilities for worship for prisoners.  Leadership of the Muslim community  On the mainland, the National Muslim Council of Tanzania elects the mufti. On Zanzibar, the President of Zanzibar appoints the mufti, who serves as a leader of the Muslim community and as a public servant assisting with local governmental affairs. The Mufti of Zanzibar nominally approves all Islamic activities and supervises all mosques on Zanzibar. The mufti also approves religious lectures by visiting Islamic clergy and supervises the importation of Islamic literature from outside Zanzibar.  Secular and religious courts  On the mainland, secular laws govern Christians and Muslims in both criminal and civil cases. In family-related cases involving inheritance, marriage, divorce, and the adoption of minors, the law also recognizes customary practices, which could include religious practices. In such cases, some Muslims choose to consult religious leaders in lieu of bringing a court case. Muslims in Zanzibar have the option of bringing cases to a civil or qadi (Islamic court or judge) for matters of divorce, child custody, inheritance, and other issues covered by Islamic law. All cases tried in Zanzibar courts, except those involving Zanzibari constitutional matters and sharia, may be appealed to the Union Court of Appeals on the mainland. Decisions of Zanzibar's qadi courts may be appealed to a special court consisting of the Zanzibar chief justice and five other sheikhs. The President of Zanzibar appoints the chief qadi, who oversees the qadi courts and is recognized as the senior Islamic scholar responsible for interpreting the Quran. There are no qadi courts on the mainland.  Education  Public schools may teach religion, but it is not a part of the official national curriculum. School administration or parent and teacher associations must approve such classes, which are taught on an occasional basis by parents or volunteers. Public school registration forms must specify a child's religious affiliation so administrators can assign students to the appropriate religion class if one is offered. Students may also choose to opt out of religious studies. In public schools, students are allowed to wear the hijab but not the niqāb.

Early life Wither was the eldest son of Charles Wither of Oakley Hall, Hampshire and his wife Dorothy Smith, daughter of Sir William Smith, 1st Baronet of Redcliff, Buckinghamshire. The family had been seated at Oakley Hall since 1626 and since then had acquired further estates in the neighbourhood, to which Wither succeeded on the death of his father in 1697. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford on 7 May 1700, aged 15, and travelled abroad in the Netherlands from 1706 to 1707. He married Frances Wavell, daughter of Thomas Wavell of Winchester, Hampshire, on 17 July 1707. Career In 1707, Wither investigated the possibility of standing for Stockbridge at the next general election and secured local Whig support. He was appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire in November 1707, but gave up the office soon after. He stood for Parliament at Whitchurch in a contested by- election on 17 January 1708, and was seated as a Whig Member of Parliament on petition on 17 February 1708.

He served as a naval instructor in navigation and Japanese and later translated a confidential history of the Russo-Japanese War. He retired as an Instructor-Captain in the Royal Navy but was recalled to duty in 1941 to run the Bedford Japanese School, which trained young men and women for work at Bletchley Park. Early years Tuck was the fourth son and fifth and last child of Henry Barber Tuck (1834-1906) and Harriott Tuck (née Horn (1837-1907). He attended the Royal Hospital School, Greenwich, leaving in January 1892 with the highest results in his class. While still at school he applied to Sir Sir William Christie, the Astronomer Royal, to take the examination to become a 'computer' at the Royal Observatory. He was the only candidate but his examination papers were judged excellent.Christie Papers RG07/134, Tuck to Christie, 8 October 1891; note dated 29 December 1891. He began work at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on 11 January 1892, at the age of 15. As a 'supernumerary computer', it was his job to turn observational data into a standard form.Jarvis 2005 (Jarvis's biography relies partly on biographical information provided by Tuck's daughter, Sylvia Crotty, who died in 2006); Christie Papers RG07/134, Tuck to Christie, 30 December 1891; Tuck Papers 1/8, 1892 diary; The Times, 13 October 1937; http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1000 In 1893 he was certified as competent in the use of the transit circle (a device similar to a meridian circle used to time the transit of stars across the local meridian) and the use of the Sheepshanks Equatorial telescope.Christie Papers RG07/136, certificates dated 24 and 27 April 1893 In July 1894, after having worked at the Royal Observatory for two and half years, he resigned his position to enter the employment of the Royal Navy as a teacher.Christie Papers RG07/138, Tuck to Christie, 13 June 1894. He must have continued his astronomical studies for, in November 1895, at the age of 19, he was the youngest person ever elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was proposed by Edward Walter Maunder, who was a senior member of staff at the Royal Observatory. He left the Royal Astronomical Society in 1901.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol. LV No. 7 (10 May 1895), p. 1, and vol. LVI No. 1 (8 November 1895), p. 1; archives of the Royal Astronomical Society. Royal Navy service in East Asia In 1894 he was appointed to teach astronomy and navigation on HMS Conway, a training ship stationed on the Mersey near Liverpool. During this period of his life he was going to the theatre and to concerts in Liverpool and was also taking London University external examinations at University College Liverpool (now the University of Liverpool). In 1898 he passed Intermediate Science and applied to become a Naval Instructor.Christie Papers RG07/138, Tuck to Christie, 13 June 1894; Tuck Papers 1/1, 1898 diary; University of London General Register Part III (1901), p.623. In June 1899 he received an appointment as a Naval Instructor, and was sent to East Asia. This was an unusual appointment in the sense that Naval Instructors were expected to have a university degree: in 1905 he was the only one without a degree with the sole exception of a man appointed in 1871.The Navy List, October 1905, pp. 166-7. He served first in HMS Goliath, a pre-Dreadnought battleship launched in 1898 and based on the China Station, and later in HMS King Alfred, an armoured cruiser which was the flagship of the China Station. In June 1904, four years after Tuck had begun learning Japanese on his own initiative and two years after the Anglo-Japanese Alliance had come into force, the Admiralty made special arrangements for the study of Japanese by naval officers, allowing up to a year's residence in Japan. In August Vice-Admiral Sir Gerard Noel, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, wrote to Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the first British ambassador to Japan, seeking the services of a ‘suitable and reliable Instructor in the Japanese language for service with the British China Squadron’, possibly a ‘suitable retired Japanese Naval Officer, who has perhaps been wounded in the war and would be glad of a little financial assistance’. In February 1905, Macdonald replied to Noel to say that Baron Komura Jutarō, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had been unable to find a suitable person.The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Admiralty Circular Letter (printed) of 10 June 1904 (7200/1904); Noel to MacDonald, 5 August 1904; MacDonald to Noel, 11 February 1905. By this time Tuck was living in Japan and studying the language full-time, although he was finding the expenses involved much greater than he had expected.The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Tuck to Captain Stoppard, 18 January 1905; Gubbins to MacDonald, 10 January 1904 [sic: 1905]. Later in 1905 Sir Claude MacDonald instructed John Harington Gubbins, who had been Japanese Secretary in the British Legation for many years and had a good command of Japanese, to examine Tuck on his knowledge of Japanese. Gubbins reported in September that Tuck had gained full marks in colloquial and more than 75% for each of the two written papers, and that he had a good knowledge of Chinese characters. ‘A little further study of newspapers, and a course of instruction in what is known as official dispatch style, would, I think, enable Mr. Tuck to attain the standard required for interpreters in the Japan Consular Service', he concluded. In December Tuck received a certificate stating that he had passed the examination for Interpreter in Japanese and a few days later received appointment as Interpreter in Japanese on HMS King Alfred.Tuck Papers 2/5. In February 1906 Vice-Admiral Noel wrote to Tuck and forwarded to him extracts from an Admiralty letter dated 25 October 1905, which stated that ‘it would be a convenience if the services of Mr. Oswald Tuck could be utilized in connection with the instruction in the Japanese language of Naval Officers on the China Station, having regard to his special qualifications for such work’. And in 1907 the Admiralty wrote to express their appreciation for Tuck's translation of a diary by a Russian officer serving on the Russian battleship Oryol.Tuck Papers 2/5. It was clear that Tuck's command of Japanese was now appreciated by the Admiralty. In 1908 he was appointed as assistant to the British Naval Attaché, Captain Dundas, in Tokyo. On 13 January he received a letter from Captain (Later Admiral Sir) Herbert King-Hall, Assistant Director of the Naval Intelligence Division in the Admiralty, suggesting that he return to England for permanent employment in the Naval Intelligence Division.Tuck Papers 1/7, 1908 diary. This indicates that Tuck was already well thought of in the Navy, and at the end of the year he decided to accept the appointment offered to him, and left Japan for the last time in his life. Return to England He returned to England in 1909 and was attached to the Naval Ordnance Department of the Admiralty while nominally assigned to HMS President.Navy List, March 1910, p. 359. He was eventually promoted to Instructor Commander, with seniority dating from 1913. During the Great War his appointment was described as, 'for duty with the Naval Staff, lent to the Historical Section of the War Cabinet'.Navy List, December 1918, p. 873. By 1921 he was Head of the Historical Section in the Training and Staff Duties Division of the Admiralty.Navy List, October 1921, p. 1816; April 1923, pp. 1815-6. He remained an Instructor Commander until he retired in 1924, when he was given the rank of Instructor Captain: he was the only one without a university degree.Navy List, July 1936, p. 646. He continued to work on the volumes of the official naval history of the Great War until 1937, in the capacity of Technical Assistant in the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Navy List, July 1935, p. 560. On the strength of his work as a historian, in 1934 he applied to the University of Cambridge when the position of Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History fell vacant, but it was in the end offered to one of his referees, Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond (1871-1946).Tuck Papers 2/5, Tuck’s correspondence with Admiral Richmond. Japanese studies and life in Japan Tuck first visited Japan in November 1900 and was immediately enthusiastic. He wrote to his future wife: 'I take back every word I have said against the Japanese; they are the most delightful people on the face of the earth. It is a perfect joy to go into a shop for the mere object of talking to the owner. Everyone has the most engaging way with them – ad all merely for politeness, not for the sake of what they can get out of you.'Tuck Papers 2/1, Tuck to Florrie, Nagasaki, 27 November 1900. He started 'struggling with Japanese' right away and by February of the following year he was already confident enough to write, 'I can now talk well enough to go about the country alone and I shall certainly do so when we get there; being able to eat the food of the country renders me quite independent.'.Tuck Papers 2/1, letters to Florrie of 29 December 1900 and 8 February 1901. In 1902, when HMS Goliath was stationed in Hong Kong, he continued to extend his knowledge of Japan by reading Lafcadio Hearn's Glimpses of unfamiliar Japan (1894) and The Mikado's Empire by William Elliot Griffis (1876). He was also practicing his Japanese with a young man named Tajima, and asked the Japanese consul to help find him a teacher. In May HMS Goliath put in to Yokohama and Tuck received the Admiral's permission to rejoin the ship at Nagasaki after travelling by train and boat to Beppu in Kyushu and then walking from there to Nagasaki. In the event he had to retrace his steps and rejoin the ship at Miyajima.Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902. By October, after a spell at Weihaiwei, the Goliath returned to Yokoyama and Tuck applied for leave to remain in Japan for four months to learn Japanese. He was permitted to bring on board a young Japanese man as a servant, Kondō Takezō: with Kondō he began learning Chinese characters. The Admiral rejected his application, saying that his job was to instruct midshipmen.Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902. He reapplied, and forwarded to the Admiral with a letter from H. Kirino, the acting Japanese consul in Hong Kong, saying, ‘I do hereby certify that Mr. Oswald T. Tuck RN of HMS Goliath can now speak Japanese tolerably well and after one year’s exclusive study there is no doubt of the possibility of his expert talking of the same.’ Tuck Papers 1/2, 1903 diary. In 1908, when he was living in Japan as assistant to the British Naval Attaché, Captain Dundas, he began translating the confidential Japanese history of the Russo-Japanese War into English. He also spent a lot of time with Kikutake Jitsuzō (1889-1946), a young student. Kikutake later graduated with a degree in Mongolian from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and then worked on the South Manchurian Railway in Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in north China.https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/innerasianstudies/25/0/25_KJ00009391607/_pdf Japanese translation and historical work After his return to England in 1909, he continued with his translation of the confidential Japanese history of the Russo-Japanese War and became assistant to the naval historian Sir Julian Corbett, who used his translation to write Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War 1904–5. In the preface Corbett wrote: 'In everything that concerns the fleet a fresh examination of all the available authorities has been made. Foremost among them is the minute and exhaustive history prepared by the Japanese Naval Staff, which, though strictly confidential, has been courteously placed at the disposal of the Admiralty by the Japanese Government for the use of naval officers only. A translation, made by Naval Instructor Oswald T. Tuck, R. N., by direction of the Naval Intelligence Division, exists at the Admiralty and it is this work which is cited as the Japanese Confidential History'.Corbett 1914, Preface p. 2 Up to 1937 he continued to translate and write historical monographs for the Navy, though none of these were published. According to Major E. Y. Daniel of the Royal Marine Light Infantry, who was assistant to Sir Julian Corbett and wrote a reference for Tuck in 1923, Tuck also wrote extensively of the Japanese role in the Great War.Jarvis 2005, p. 201. The source cited by Tuck is the original letter which at the time of writing was evidently still in the possession of Tuck's daughter, Sylvia Crotty; this letter is, however, not among the extant Tuck Papers. The historical monographs are presumably still in the possession of the Naval Historical Branch at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. He also played an active part in the Japan Society, which he joined as a life member in 1909: he served on the Council and gave lectures on a variety of subjects in the 1920s and 1930s.Jarvis 2005 Censorship In September 1939 Tuck came out of retirement and was appointed Assistant Press Censor in Japanese at the Ministry of Information, serving under Arthur Waley, the scholar and translator of Chinese and Japanese. Tuck's knowledge of Japanese was put to use checking the dispatches that Japanese journalists based in London were sending back to Japan. In December 1941, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japanese journalists and other Japanese citizens in Britain were interned on the Isle of Man, so there was no further need for his services as a censor. The head of Press Censorship therefore offered Tuck's services to the Admiralty on 16 December and on 22 December Tuck had an interview with Colonel John Tiltman, who had decided to experiment with 6-month courses in Japanese to meet wartime needs for cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park. On 2 January 1942 Tuck met Commander Alastair Denniston, the head of Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, and he visited Bletchley on 13 January.Tuck papers 2/5, typed notes by Tuck’s daughter, Sylvia Crotty; Tiltman, p. 5. Bedford Japanese School Colonel Tiltman states that he had been advised to recruit students with scholarships to study the Classics at Oxford and Cambridge, and for this purpose he approached Dr Alexander Lindsay, the Master of Balliol College, Oxford, and Mr Martin Charlesworth, the President of St John's College, Cambridge.Tiltman, p. 9. In fact, whereas most students studying scientific subjects or modern languages had already been called up for special war service, nobody had yet thought of a use for classicists, so Tiltman could take his pick of the best.Tuck, Bedford Japanese School, p. 20. The candidates were interviewed in January 1942 and the first class assembled in the Inter- Services Special Intelligence School at Bedford on 2 February. The few available dictionaries and textbooks all belonged to Tuck himself, and the course was devised by him in order to convey the essentials of the formal military Japanese that the students would later be handling. The course ended on 27 June after a little less than five months, but the results had been beyond all expectations and it was decided to recruit for a second course.Tuck, Bedford Japanese School, from which all details in this section are taken. After finishing the course the 22 men and one woman were sent to the Naval Section at Bletchley Park, to the Military Wing at Bletchley Park, to the Air Section at Bletchley Park or to the Foreign Office intelligence unit in Berkeley Street, London. Some of them were later sent out to Colombo, New Delhi or Mauritius, where they worked as translators and/or cryptanalysts at wireless intercept stations. The second course began in August 1942 and from this point on Tuck was assisted by some of his most able students from the first course, particularly Eric Ceadel, who in 1947 became the first lecturer in Japanese at Cambridge University. The succession of courses ended with the eleventh course, which began on 5 May 1945 and ended on 10 November. By that time the war was over, so the projected courses 12 and 13 were cancelled. Tuck was asked to write a history of the Bedford Japanese School, and on 7 December 1945 Frank Birch, the Deputy Director of the Government Code & Cypher School, wrote to acknowledge receipt of Tuck's account: ‘What you haven’t said in your history (but, thank goodness, it sticks out a mile) is your tremendous triumph over wrongheaded experts, red tape, neglect and almost impossible conditions. The tremendous value of your contribution and its great significance in the total British effort in the Japanese war – that, I hope, will be recognised in the G.C.C.S. histories (it certainly will in the Naval history) now being written.’Tuck Papers 2/9, letter from Birch to Tuck. In all more than 220 students were trained at the Bedford Japanese School, including nine women. After the war some returned to their former pursuits, such as Hugh Lloyd-Jones, who became Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford and was knighted, and Maurice Wiles, who became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. Others abandoned their former interests and became sinologists or japanologists, such as David Hawkes, later Professor of Chinese at Oxford, Geoffrey Bownas, later Professor of Japanese at Sheffield University, and Albert Richard Davis, who became Professor of Chinese at Sydney University. Some became famous for other reasons, such as Denise Newman, who served as the only female skipper in the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service for eight years, and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic in 1988 at the age of 64, and Wilfrid Noyce, who was a member of the 1953 British Everest Expedition and later died in a mountaineering accident in the Pamirs.For biographies of all the students see Kornicki 2019. Final years In 1946 Tuck was asked to take charge of a group of men who were required to translate captured Japanese materials at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and this lasted from 6 March to 22 November. Some had been students at Bedford Japanese School, while others had learnt Japanese in the Naval Section at Bletchley Park. During the year several of his former students from Bedford came to visit him, and in May he visited both Oxford and Cambridge where his former students, now back at university, were his hosts at commemorative dinners.'[Diary of the] Japanese Translation party', Tuck Papers 1/11; Kornicki 2019, pp. xix-xx. Like others who worked at Bletchley Park during the war, Tuck received no honours or recognition after the war. He was, however, warmly appreciated by his former pupils: Eric Ceadel continued to write to him from Cambridge, and David Goldberg, one of the many Jews at Bedford and Bletchley Park wrote, ‘I should like you to accept the little book enclosed herewith as a token of my thanks to you for the past six months so pleasantly spent in Bedford, and especially for helping me to keep our Jewish religious observances throughout the period.’ Tuck Papers 1/10, 1/11, 2/9. See also Martin Sugarman, ‘Breaking the codes: Jewish personnel at Bletchley Park’, Jewish historical studies 40 (2005): 197-246. A year after Tuck's death Ceadel, in a lecture at the Japan Society, wrote movingly of his memories of Tuck: 'The late Captain Oswald T. Tuck RN, who died early last year, meant much to me, for it was he who instructed me in Japanese. Over 200 of his wartime students will always treasure a clear memory of his erect and dignified figure, with white hair and beard, and of his fine qualities of mind and character. In a quiet but effective manner he drew the interest of his students, and succeeded in imparting to them not only the basis of the Japanese language, but also an understanding and appreciation of many faces of Japanese literature, art and life.'Ceadel 1951. Family On 25 July 1912 Tuck married Florence Jane Peglar (1873-1956): in his letters he referred to her as Florrie and then, after they were married, as Peggy. They had two children, Eleanor Margery (1913-1984, married surname Vincent-Townend) and Sylvia Catherine (1920-2006, married surname Crotty).Tuck's letters in the Tuck Papers; family tree on ancestry.co.uk Publications 'Some Comic Medieval Plays of Japan', Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society, vol.XXI (28 Nov.1923).
