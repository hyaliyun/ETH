George Antheil asserted that Fanelli was \\"one of the greatest inventors and musical iconoclasts of all time\\", but he remains an obscure figure. Life Fanelli was born in Paris, his family having emigrated to France from Bologna. He studied music at the Conservatoire de Paris for a few years from 1876, but was expelled because of his disputes with the teaching staff. The claim that he studied there with Charles-Valentin AlkanW. H. Rosar, New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (London: Macmillan, 2001). is mistaken, as Alkan quit the Conservatoire in 1848, but he may have studied with Alkan's brother, Napol√©on, who was the Conservatoire professor of solf√®ge at the time. Fanelli worked as a timpanist before returning to musical studies under L√©o Delibes. Again he failed to complete his studies, this time for lack of funds, and returned to work as a percussionist. He continued in self-taught studies of composition and began to create his own works.Adriano, Symphonic Pictures, booklet to Marco Polo CD, p. 1‚Äì4. In 1912, Fanelli was seeking work as a musical copyist, and submitted a manuscript to Gabriel Piern√© as an example of his neat handwriting. Piern√© was intrigued by the music itself, which Fanelli told him was one of his own compositions, Tableaux symphoniques, written nearly 30 years earlier. Piern√© found evidence of radical musical innovations anticipating the recent work of Claude Debussy. He arranged for Th√®bes, the first part of the Tableaux, to be performed, creating a sensation in the musical press. Piern√© later performed several other works by Fanelli. Debussy himself reviewed the work, taking a sceptical view that Fanelli had \\"an acute sense of musical ornamentation\\" but that it \\"dragged [him] towards such an extreme need of minute description\\" that it made him \\"lose his sense of direction\\". Fanelli was supported by Judith Gautier, the daughter of the writer Th√©ophile Gautier, whose novel The Romance of the Mummy had inspired the Tableaux symphoniques. Gautier sponsored a private performance of the work and helped to fund him to produce transcriptions of his works.Bettina Liebowitz Knapp, Judith Gautier: Writer, Orientalist, Musicologist, Feminist (Hamilton, 2004), pp. 250, 299, 310. Fanelli himself was unable to capitalise on his new fame. He had given up composing in 1894, several years before he became well known, and could not or would not resume creative work. He continued to work as a performer to support his wife and children and died a few years later. Rumours Because the work predated the innovations of Maurice Ravel and Debussy there was speculation that either or both of them had seen the score in manuscript form. Ravel himself is widely reported to have commented \\"now we know where his [Debussy‚Äôs] impressionism comes from\\". However, a closer look at Ravel's published review reveals that he was speaking ironically and defending Debussy: > Above all, the investigations of the young Fanelli could not have diminished > those of his colleagues. [...] This noble courage, which consists of > crushing the innovations of troublesome innovators with the innovations of > their predecessors, has uncovered the source of Claude Debussy's > impressionism in M. Fanelli's piece. One critic, carried away by his own > enthusiasm, even thought it necessary to state point-blank that in this > symphonic poem, \\"the conception and the harmonic language are clearly > Debussyian, or rather pre-Debussyian,\\" [...] It is customary for M. Debussy > to undergo a yearly attack of this sort. We already knew that the discovery > of his harmonic system was entirely due to Erik Satie, that his stage works > derived from Mussorgsky, and his orchestration from Rimsky-Korsakov. We now > know the source of his impressionism. Despite this paucity of invention, > Debussy only remains the most important and profoundly musical composer > living today.Arbie Orenstein (ed.), \\"A Ravel Reader: Correspondence, > Articles, Interviews\\" (Courier Dover Publications, 2003), p. 350. Debussy is said to have been so sensitive to these claims that he tried to avoid being seen listening to Fanelli's work. Ezra Pound recalled an episode in which he was sitting in a restaurant listening to Fanelli play a composition on the piano when Debussy walked in. As soon as Debussy saw Fanelli, he walked out again. After his death his widow is supposed to have claimed that Erik Satie, Ravel and Debussy had all visited Fanelli's home and studied his unpublished scores before writing their own works. This alleged claim was published by George Antheil. Antheil states that Constantine von Sternberg had told him of Fanelli's innovations, and that he visited Fanelli's widow, who allowed him to peruse her husband's scores. Antheil wrote, > I soon discovered that Constantine von Sternberg had been right, at least in > one regard: the works of Fanelli were pure \\"Afternoon of a Faun\\" or \\"Daphnis > and Chloe\\", at least in technique, and they predated the Debussy-Ravel-Satie > works by many years. But, as I also soon discovered, they were not as > talented as the works of the two slightly younger men although they had had > the advantage of being \\"firsts\\" ... Debussy was the genius who had distilled > Fanelli into immortality!George Antheil, Bad Boy of Music (Doubleday, 1945), > p. 129. However, there are dissenting opinions. The writer and critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who heard the first performance of Th√®bes, commented \\"I should not say that in idiom and technical treatment it is as far in advance of its time as well-meaning journalists would have it\\". He also describes the composer's L'Effroi du soleil, perhaps implying an anticipation of cheap film music, as follows: \\"A severed head bounces from the scaffold, rolls over hills and dales, the executioner vainly pursuing it [....] whilst torrents of blood cover the whole landscape\\".M. D. Calvocoressi, An Unknown Musical Composer of Today, in The Musical Times, vol. 53 no. 830 (1 April 1912), pp. 225‚Äì6. The entry in Grove is almost entirely based on this article. Compositions Fanelli's most notable composition, Tableaux symphoniques d'apres le Roman de la Momie was a symphonic poem in a series of \\"tableaux\\" illustrating the novel The Romance of the Mummy by Th√©ophile Gautier. The first part, Th√®bes, is supposed to represent the Egyptian capital city. The second part, F√™te dans le palais du Pharaon, depicting royal festivities, was never published, but was performed in 1913. Other scores were also performed, and are known from reviews and comments. Known compositions by Fanelli are: Stage * Les Deux tonneaux (1879), three acts, after Voltaire. Orchestral * St Preux √† Clarens (1881) * symphonic poem Th√®bes (1883) * Mascarade (1889) * Suite Rabelaisienne (1889) * Carnaval (1890) * Tableaux symphoniques d'apr√®s le roman de la momie (1883/1886) * Impressions pastorales (1890) * Au palais de l'escorial (1890) * Marche h√©ro√Øque (1891) * L'Effroi du soleil (undated) Piano and Chamber * Souvenirs de jeunesse (1872‚Äì1878) * Souvenirs po√®tiques (1872‚Äì1878) * Une Nuit chez Sophor (1891) * 32 chansons (1880‚Äì1892) * Humoresques (1892‚Äì1894) * string quintet, \\"L'Aneau\\" (1894) References Category:1860 births Category:1917 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th- century French composers Category:19th-century male musicians Category:20th- century French musicians Category:20th-century French male musicians Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French percussionists Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French people of Italian descent Category:French Romantic composers Category:Impressionist composers Category:Music copyists Category:Musicians from Paris Category:Pupils of L√©o Delibes Category:Timpanists ","title":"Ernest Fanelli"},{"id":"24197428","text":"Holy Trinity Church, Trowbridge, is a Grade II* listed 19th-century Church of England church in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, which had parish church status until 2011. It is commonly known in Trowbridge as ‚ÄòThe Church on the Roundabout‚Äô, as it is encircled by a one-way traffic system.Holy Trinity, Trowbridge: Church History John Baxter, June 1988 History Holy Trinity Church, completed in 1838 The Trowbridge manor which included the land on which the church stands was bought in 1807 from the fifth Duke of Rutland, who retained the patronage. It had been noted that the existing parish church could barely hold a twelfth of the 12,000 population, and so plans were set in motion to build a new, larger church. In 1835 fund-raising appeals were begun by Francis Fulford, the then-rector of the parish church of St. James, with estimated construction costs of ¬£4000. The total cost of the church was ¬£5,251 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), towards which a grant of ¬£1,676 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was provided by the Church Building Commissioners. The building contractors for the church were Charles and Richard Gane. A. F. Livesay of Portsmouth was appointed as architect. Other works of his included the recently completed Holy Spirit Church, Newtown, on the Isle of Wight. Livesay's design is in the Early English architectural style, and is based on elements of Salisbury Cathedral, including the vaulting and bosses of the north and south aisles in the Cathedral. The church was built of poor-quality Westwood stone, with the interior having iron and plaster columns (the plaster painted to mimic marble such as the Purbeck marble of Salisbury cathedral's columns), and plaster scribed with false ashlar blocks to mimic high-quality stonework in the vaulting and walls. There were four porches, one of which (the south porch, the main entrance to the church nowadays) is situated under an embattled tower. The windows were originally plain, clear glass. Unusually, the church is not oriented east/west, but rather north-east/south-west. The foundation stone was laid in 1837, with the builders Richard and Charles Gane. 7,000 people attended the ceremony, indicating the importance of the event. The building took just over a year to complete, and cost ¬£6,415 and 12 shillings. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 1 November 1838. At this time it had a west gallery which extended as far as the first set of iron columns, and the organ, actually a seraphine, was also at this end of the church. A plaque on the south wall states that on consecration it held seats for 1033 parishioners. Other alterations to the arrangement of the church's layout have since been made. The clergy vestry was in the south-east corner, in the area now occupied by the toilets off the south transept. The north-east porch is now the flower vestry, and the font originally stood where the organ is now, but was replaced by a newer font in 1874. The nave, south aisle and south transept of the church. In 1852 a new organ was installed in the west gallery, and in 1861-2 new heating apparatus was installed. In 1866 the first marble wall monument was erected. In 1871 the south transept was turned into a side chapel for weekday services. To mark the church's 50-year jubilee in 1888, the west gallery was removed and the organ moved to the chancel area and choir stalls added alongside. The font was moved to the west gallery at the same time. In 1898 the west end of the church was partially re-seated. In 1901 the first serious report on the church's fabric showed the folly of using the relatively cheap Westwood stone, with weak buttresses and weathered stone. Between 1902 and 1904 the chancel was raised above the level of the nave and screens erected forming and organ chamber on the north and a choir vestry to the south. In 1908 the reseating of the church was completed, reducing the seats from 1033 to nearer 750. The reredos in All Saints' Chapel at the east end of the church. The All Saints' chapel (at the eastern end of the church) was refurbished in 1911. In 1914 the high altar reredos with credence table, Bishop's stall and sedilia was erected, the work of A. L. Moore of London. The reredos is of carved oak with panels of opus sectile, showing adoring angels in the centre, with the Nativity to the left and the Resurrection to the right, with flanking portraits, two on either side, of the four Archangels - Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In 1927 a reredos was dedicated in the All Saints' Chapel, showing the Transfiguration, and signed by A. L. and C. E. Moore and dated 1924. In 1940, a screen was erected between the Lady Chapel (in the north transept) and the nave. A new choir vestry at the west end of the nave was built as a memorial to those who died in World War II. The font was moved from this area and placed under the Norris window in the south transept. The names of the 56 members of the parish who died in the war are carved on the screen, on either side of the central door. The screen was dedicated in 1951. In 1955 the former choir vestry in the All Saints' Chapel was converted to a side chapel. In the 1970s, the development of the new Trowbridge inner relief road involved the demolition of a few buildings near the church, and the creation of a one-way traffic-light controlled roundabout around the church, effectively isolating it. It soon gained the local nickname \\"The Church on the Roundabout\\". In 1980-1 the vicar's vestry was converted to toilets, the font was moved to near the main door, and a screen to match that in the Lady Chapel was erected between the south transept and the nave. This area was used as a cr√®che. At the same time a simple, movable wooden nave altar was installed. The pews were removed in 2000 and replaced with chairs. Windows On each side of the east window is a window to the memory of Charles Gane, one of the builders of the church, who died in 1866. That on the left represents the Resurrection, and that on the right the Ascension. The maker is unknown. The memorial window to Reverend Digby Walsh, made by A. L. Moore. On the south wall near the east end of the church is the memorial window to the Revd Digby Walsh, vicar of the church for eleven years and who died at the age of 39 in 1869. The maker was A. L. Moore of London. In 1906 Alice Ewing, the wife of the vicar Robert Ewing, died, and a window in her memory was inserted in the north wall. Robert died a few years later in 1908, and the magnificent east window was inserted in 1909 in his honour. The window was also designed and made by A. L. Moore, and the left-hand upper window depicts the Crucifixion, with Mary, John and Mary Magdalene; the window below shows Christ telling Peter \\"Feed my lambs\\", a reference to Dr Ewing's educational work. The right-hand upper window represents the Ascension; the light below shows the aged grandmother and mother teaching the scriptures to Timothy, the subject of Dr Ewing's last sermon, preached the day before he died. Jesus is shown in the upper rose; some of the stonework was cut away to allow a greater area for the stained glass image. In 1913 the small window above the flower vestry door in the north wall was inserted in the memory of Harry Moore, the church organist who had died the previous year. It shows St. Gregory holding a sheet of plainsong. The window in the south transept in memory of Florence Norris, made by Morris & Co. In 1937 the windows in the south transept were dedicated in memory of Florence Norris. They show the charity of Dorcas top left; beneath is St Martin on horseback with a beggar. The top right window shows Jesus at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, and below is Jesus healing Lazarus. The windows were made by Morris & Co. In 1945 the windows were erected in the Lady Chapel in memory of Arthur Stancomb. They were designed to echo the style of the windows in the chapel in the south transept. The top left light shows Christ the good shepherd, with St. Francis beneath him. The top right light shows Jesus with the little children, and below is St. Christopher, patron saint of travellers. Redecoration and repair The first episode of redecoration and repair of the church interior and churchyard occurred during Digby Walsh's tenure as vicar, i.e. sometime between 1858‚Äì1869, with a second taking place in 1884. Records are unclear about the intervening period, but the church was again redecorated completely in 1967-8, and as part of the redecoration the half-shafts of the pillars on the walls were removed, apart from at the far east and west ends of the church. In 2009 the church was repaired and redecorated internally, with the colour scheme changing from blues and stone colours to reds, pinks, white and gold. The churchyard A Portland stone cross was erected as a memorial to the fallen of World War I from the parish. It bears 147 names in total, and was dedicated in 1921. Many of the gravestones were removed in 1977. Church status When the church was first built, it was a chapelry of the town's parish church, St James'. A parish was created for it in 1839 by combining the tithings of Studley and Little Trowle, with boundaries defined largely by the River Biss and the Trowle Brook. Studley (then a rural community) became a separate district in 1858, after the building of St John's church there in 1852. In 1976 the church was designated as Grade II* listed. The building ceased to be a parish church in December 2010 when its parish was divided between four neighbouring parishes, and the building then became a chapel of ease within the parish of St. Thomas the Apostle, Trowbridge. The proposed merger with the nearby Methodist church at Wesley Road never took place. Holy Trinity continues in use for the evening services formerly held at St. Thomas's, and for outreach work within Trowbridge, youth work, concerts, a mothers and toddlers group, and other activities.http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/inyourtown/trowbridgenews/4498349.Future_of_landmark_church_in_Trowbridge_has_altared/ See also * List of Commissioners' churches in southwest England References Gallery File:Holy Trinity Church Trowbridge seating and altar.JPG File:Holy Trinity Church Trowbridge view in from south porch (under tower).JPG|View into the church from the south porch File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge columns and vaults, west end.JPG|Columns and vaults at the west end of the church, showing undecorated far west end File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge east end (2).JPG File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge south door and south transept.JPG|South door and south transept File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge vaults, columns and bosses.JPG|Vaults, ribs and bosses of the south aisle, based on those of the aisles in Salisbury Cathedral File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge west end and screen.JPG|World War II memorial screen at west end of church File:Holy Trinity Church east window.JPG|East window, in All Saints Chapel File:Holy Trinity Church NE window.JPG|Window in memory of Charles Gane, in NE corner of All Saints Chapel File:Holy Trinity Church Trowbridge south east window.JPG|Window in memory of Charles Gane, in SE corner of All Saints Chapel File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge Lady Chapel window.JPG|The window in the Lady Chapel in the north transept in memory of Arthur Stancomb File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge Lady Chapel window top left.JPG|Detail of Lady Chapel window - Christ the good shepherd File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge Lady Chapel window top right.JPG|Detail of Lady Chapel window - Jesus with the little children File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge Lady Chapel window bottom left.JPG|Detail of Lady Chapel window - St Francis File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge Lady Chapel window bottom right.JPG|Detail of Lady Chapel window - St Christopher File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge south transept window detail.JPG|Detail of south transept window showing Morris & Co. makers' name File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge north window.JPG|Window high in north aisle in memory of Harry Moore, showing St Gregory File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge window north aisle.JPG|Window in north aisle in memory of Alice Ewing File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge reredos centre.JPG|Detail of the centre panel of the reredos File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge reredos left.JPG|Detail of the left panel of the reredos File:Holy Trinity Trowbridge reredos right.JPG|Detail of the right panel of the reredos External links * Wiltshire Community History page on the Church * Parish of St Thomas, Trowbridge Category:Church of England church buildings in Wiltshire Category:Commissioners' church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1838 Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Anglican congregations established in the 19th century Holy Trinity ","title":"Holy Trinity Church, Trowbridge"},{"id":"24197434","text":"Andrea Meikle (n√©e Crowther) (born 18 November 1963) is a former association football player who represented New Zealand at international level.

Georgian naval raids  Twenty- three cargo ships have been detained in the Black Sea by the Georgian Navy in 2009. Abkhaz authorities have called the Georgian actions \\"piracy.\\" In mid- August, Georgia seized a Turkish tanker delivering gasoline and diesel to Abkhazia. The ship was taken into Georgian government ownership, and may later be auctioned by the Georgian ministry of finance. A Georgian court sentenced the captain of the ship to 24 years in prison for smuggling and violating the ban on unauthorized economic activity with Abkhazia.  Reactions  On 2 September 2009, President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh warned that the Abkhazian naval forces will destroy any Georgian ships engaged in future \\"pirate actions\\". Georgia's deputy prime minister Temur Yakobashvili shrugged off the Abkhazian threat, saying that Abkhazia has no technical means to destroy ships. \\"Moreover,\\" Yakobashvili said, \\"it is not his [Bagapsh's] business. It looks more like a pre-election bluff.\\" The Georgian Foreign Minister, Grigol Vashadze, said Bagapsh was a criminal and it was up to Georgian law enforcement agencies to respond to his threats.Georgian FM: Bagapsh is a Criminal.

September 3, 2009 Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry said, on September 3, 2009, further seizure of cargo ships en route to Abkhazia by Georgian coast guard may cause ‚Äúserious armed incidents‚Äù and blamed Georgia for possible escalation. Earlier, Deputy head of Russian Federal Security Service border guard department, Yevgeny Inchin, said on August 28, 2009 that a unit of the Russian border guards in Abkhazia would be dispatched to provide security for ships entering Abkhazia. This statement was denounced by Georgia as a violation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) said on September 2, 2009 that it was concerned about the statements by the Georgian, Abkhaz and Russian sides on the matter and the issue was to be included in the agenda of the meeting under the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) scheme between the sides planned for September 8 in Gali.

Life and times Acosta was born in 1825 to Magdalena Santa Coloma Lezica, the daughter of a prominent Buenos Aires Province landowner, and Jos√© Francisco Acosta, from Corrientes Province. Opposed to the repressive regime of Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas, Acosta emigrated to Europe shortly after his secondary school graduation. He returned following Rosas' defeat at the 1852 Battle of Caseros, and was elected to the Buenos Aires Province Legislature later that year. He served as a lieutenant in the Patricios Regiment, and took part in Valent√≠n Alsina's successful pro-autonomy uprising in 1853 against the victor at Caseros, Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. He was returned to the Buenos Aires Legislature the following year and was named Commissioner of Immigration. A dispute with the new Governor, Pastor Obligado, kept Acosta out of public service from 1855 to 1860, when he was elected to the provincial constitutional convention. Acosta married in 1857; his wife, Remedios Oromi, was a niece of Remedios de Escalada, the erstwhile wife of General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n (leader of the Argentine War of Independence). Governor Mariano Saavedra appointed Acosta Minister of Government in 1862, and he served as a member of the Veterans' Assistance Commission from 1866 to 1872. Acosta, in 1871, also served as a legal adviser to the newly formed Western Railway, and as President of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. Acosta returned briefly to the legislature, and in 1872, he was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province. His tenure became known for its works of infrastructure, and among his varied public works initiatives, he appointed Argentina's first engineer, Luis Huergo, to plan an extensive road and canal building program. Governor Acosta promulgated a new provincial constitution in December 1873, and shortly afterwards, he was named running mate to the National Autonomist Party nominee, Nicol√°s Avellaneda. Elected handily in September 1874, Avellaneda and Acosta were opposed by Bartolom√© Mitre, who maintained a rivalry with Avellaneda's benefactor, outgoing Vice President Adolfo Alsina.Levene, Ricardo.

Founded by the Lebanese German Association for the Promotion of Culture, a non-profit NGO, the Lebanese German University opened its doors in October 2008 after obtaining Presidential Decree number 794, dated October 5, 2007. In the fall semester of the academic year 2008/2009, 200 students were registered at LGU in different majors. In the spring semester, students‚Äô enrolment increased by 30% and is constantly increasing by 20% yearly. Today LGU has over 500 students, 25 administrative and logistics employees, 24 full- time professors, and 126 part-time assistant professors. All courses are given in both English and French with modern teaching methods supported by information technologies. German is taught as an elective language course and is also sponsored by the University to encourage students to learn German culture and language. History The Lebanese German University is the outcome of a 35-year journey in education that started when the Lebanese German Organization for the Promotion of Culture and its Chairman, Dr. Faouzi Adaimi, set out on their long mission. In 1974 the Organization founded the Technical Institute of Paramedical Sciences (TIPS). As an institute of higher education, TIPS graduated over 2500 students in the field of healthcare and was renowned for being one of the most acknowledged institutions of higher education in Lebanon. In 1986, the German School was established for primary up to high school levels. The German Cultural House (Kulturzentrum) was founded in 1988 and has since been busy organizing concerts, conferences, art exhibitions to help promote German culture and language in Lebanon. The annual Kulturzentrum Festival is recognized by the Ministry of Tourism as an International Festival. Academics LGU implements the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) in all majors. This system facilitates the transfer of students to European universities as well students‚Äô exchange between LGU and academic establishments in Europe. To graduate, students need to complete 180 credits in three years for most majors, and 240 credits in four years for a major in Physical Therapy. LGU has academic cooperation agreements with European universities mainly in Germany, France, and the UK. The diplomas delivered by LGU are the bachelor's degree for all majors and the master's degree in Podotherapy for the Physical Therapy major. LGU is the first university in Lebanon to offer such a degree in collaboration with the renowned ‚ÄòEcole de Podologie de Marseilles‚Äô. The majors offered at LGU relate to specializations in public health, business, fine arts and education.

The site of the iron works was south of Mancelona, between U.S. Route 131 and the railroad tracks. History In 1882, an organization by the name of \\"John Otis & Company\\" built a large charcoal furnace on the site. The company also platted a town around the furnace, naming it \\"Furnaceville\\". Soon after this, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad built a station at the town. The furnace flourished, and in 1886 a group of businessmen from Grand Rapids bought out the company, and renamed the company Antrim Iron Works and the town Antrim. A large blast furnace and iron works was built on the site, and the new company began doing business. Methods of manufacturing and transportation In the beginning of the corporation, timber was hauled in from various lumber camps around Northern Michigan to be harvested for iron products at the plant. After many years of buying material to create the iron with, the company decided to obtain its own timber, and built a small railroad branch (named the Mancelona North West Railroad) heading 2 miles west from the company site. With this spur line, the company logged its own lumber and hauled it in on its own railroad, proving to be quite self-sufficient. This lasted until the 1920s, when the lumber ran out and other ways were developed to obtain the iron. The war During World War II the company became extremely busy. With the vast need for materials for the war effort, the factory was working around the clock trying to produce enough products for the orders they were getting. This held true throughout most of the war. Closing, demise, and current status After the war ended, the company quickly slowed down, and closed in 1945. The factory stood abandoned for over forty years, until it was torn down in the mid-1980s. Today all that is left of the old furnace consists of a few foundations, a small outbuilding, and a former railroad siding. The company dumped its waste in a pond behind the building, which years later led to water contamination in the town. The pond, called \\"Tar Lake\\", was cleaned up in the mid to late 1990s.

Thomas Hoatson Jr. attended school in Calumet until he was seventeen, after which he followed in his father's footsteps and went to work for the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. In March, 1901, Hoatson was involved in organizing the Bisbee Mine in Bisbee, Arizona, along with his elder brother James and other investors. Thomas Hoatson was elected second vice-president of the company. The mine later changed its name to the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, and proved wildly successful, netting the investors, including Hoatson, substantial wealth. Despite the Arizona location of the Bisbee mine, Hoatson chose to make his home in the Keweenaw Peninsula. He also served as vice-president of several other mines, as well as president of the Calumet State Bank and a director of the First National Bank of Calumet.

While most people do not like being laughed at, there is a sub-group of people that exceedingly fear it, and without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in psychology, sociology, and psychiatry, and has been studied intensively. In his clinical observations, Dr. Michael TitzeTitze, M. (1996). \\"The Pinocchio Complex: Overcoming the fear of laughter\\". Humor & Health Journal 5, 1-11. found that some of his patients seemed to be primarily worried about being laughed at. They tended to scan their environment for signs of laughter and ridicule. Furthermore, they reported that they had the impression of being ridiculous themselves. Additionally, Titze observed a specific movement pattern among them when they thought they were being laughed at‚Äîawkward, wooden movements that resembled those of wooden puppets. He described this state as \\"Pinocchio-syndrome\\". Two other behaviours related to laughter are gelotophilia, the joy of being laughed at, and katagelasticism, the joy of laughing at others.  Causes  From the clinical observations a model of the causes and consequences of gelotophobia was drawn upRuch, W. (2004). \\"Gelotophobia: A useful new concept?\\" Paper presented at the 2004 Colloquium Series, Department of Psychology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley US. so that the condition could be studied scientifically. The model claims that gelotophobia can be caused by any one of three things at different stages of development: The putative causes of gelotophobia: * In infancy: development of primary shame failure to develop an interpersonal bridge (e.g. unsupportive infant‚Äìcaregiver interactions). * In childhood and youth: repeated traumatic experiences of not being taken seriously or being laughed at/ridiculed (e.g. bullying), or online bullying (e.g cyberbullying) * In adulthood: intense traumatic experience of being laughed at or ridiculed (e.g. mockery). The consequences of gelotophobia: * Social withdrawal to avoid being ridiculed. * Appearing 'cold as ice'/humourless. * Psychosomatic disturbances, e.g. blushing, tension headache, trembling, dizziness, sleep disturbances. * Demonstrating 'Pinocchio Syndrome:' clumsy, 'agelotic' face, 'wooden puppet' appearance. * Lack of liveliness, spontaneity, joy. * Inability to experience humour/laughter as relaxing and joyful social experiences. * Anger when being laughed at by other people (in some cases this results in violent attacks on the people who were laughing).\\"Gelotophobia: living a life in fear of laughter\\", BBC News, 26 June 2014 Later this model was revised and expanded.  Diagnosis There is a fifteen-item questionnaire for the subjective assessment of gelotophobia, e.g. the GELOPH<15>. This questionnaire has been used to show that gelotophobia exists, to varying degrees, in a normal population.Ruch, W., & Proyer, R. T. (2008). \\"The fear of being laughed at: Individual and group differences in gelotophobia\\". Humor, 21(1), 47-67. It has been found on every continent and has, so far, had samples taken from 72 countries and the GELOPH<15> has been translated into over 42 different languages. Different countries vary in the number of people within the population, who are gelotophobes.Proyer, R.T., Ruch, W., Ali, N.S., Al-Olimat, H.S., Andualem Adal, T., Aziz Ansari S et al. (2009). \\"Breaking ground in cross-cultural research on the fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia): multi-national study involving 73 countries\\". Humor, 22, 253-279. The sociologist Christie Davies predicts a higher prevalence of gelotophobia in hierarchically organized societies where the main means of social control is shame. Research into gelotophobia using the GELOPH scales shows that empirically, the condition exists outside of people who seek therapy due to experiencing a problematic fear of being laughed at. In the first studies, gelotophobes were distinguished from other people with shame- based problems and non-shame based neurotics and samples of a normal population. Basically, this means that even though gelotophobia shares similar problems, high scores were also found for these criteria in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and Cluster A personality disorders. The fear of being laughed at has also been studied among children and adolescents using modifications of these diagnostic instruments  Emotions  Although at face value the emotions relating to gelotophobia would be predominantly fear, there is a distinct interplay with three dominant emotions:Platt, T. & Ruch, W. (2009). \\"The emotions of gelotophobes: Shameful, fearful and joyless?\\" Humor, 22, 91-110. low levels of joy, high levels of fear, and high levels of shame. More importantly, where shame in a typical week exceeds joy, gelotophobia is more likely to develop. Gelotophobes say that they are bad at regulating their emotions, and they more easily pick up the negative moods of other people. They also suppress expression of their emotions and do not share their feelings readily with others.Papousek, I., Ruch, W., Freudenthaler, H. H., Kogler, E., Lang, B., & Schulter, G. (2009). \\"Gelotophobia, emotion- related skills and responses to the affective states of others\\". Personality and Individual Differences, 47, 58-63.  Perception and personality  Gelotophobes do not have the ability to understand the difference between playful forms of humorous interactions such as teasing, and crueller forms such as ridicule. This means that even if someone is trying to be friendly and playful, a gelotophobe will feel apprehensive and mistake the interaction for ridicule. It can also mean that people may feel they are being bullied when in fact they are not.Platt, T., Proyer, R.T. & Ruch, W. (2009). \\"Gelotophobia and bullying: The assessment of the fear of being laughed at and its application among bullying victims\\". Psychology Science Quarterly, 5,135-147. Gelotophobes are often located in both the Eysenck PEN and the Big Five models of personality. Gelotophobia correlates highly with introversion and neuroticism, and on older P-scales, gelotophobes score higher in psychoticism.Ruch, W., & Proyer, R. T. (2009). \\"Who Fears Being Laughed at? The Location of Gelotophobes in the Eysenckian PEN-model of Personality\\". Personality and Individual Differences, 46(5-6), 627-630. The dimensional assessment of personality pathology, a DSM personality disorder instrument, showed that those with a fear of being laughed at tend to be socially avoidant and submissive, as well as having identity problems. Social withdrawal and suspiciousness most frequently predicted gelotophobia. Paul Lewis (Boston College, US) speculated whether political gelotophobia might affect elections in the US (\\"The twin fears of being effectively mocked or ineffective in mocking others [too harsh, blunt, tasteless] led candidates to aggressive and proactive strategies [going on TV to show they can take a joke, be funny‚Äîanything to avoid being rendered pathetically ridiculous or inappropriately derisive]\\") [p. 42, conference abstract from the 2009 conference of the International Society for Humor Studies ISHS in Long Beach, California]; Sociologist Christie Davies, who is also president of the ISHS, comments satirically on the results of recent elections in the UK. He noticed that losers in those elections were frequently bald‚Äî\\"To be bald is to suffer from gelotophobia, to fear being laughed at; to fear being laughed at is to fear disorder; to fear disorder is to embrace absolutism\\".Socialaffairsunit.org.uk  Strengths, intelligence and humour ability  A number of tests show that gelotophobes often underestimate their own potential and achievements. Gelotophobes tend to see themselves as less virtuous than people who know them. Similarly, in an intelligence study, gelotophobes consistently underestimated their intellectual performance by as much as 6 IQ points.Proyer, R. T., & Ruch, W. (2009). \\"How virtuous are gelotophobes? Self- and Peer-reported character strengths among those who fear being laughed at\\". Humor, 22, 145-163. Gelotophobes have a different experience of laughter: it does not lift their mood or make them more cheerful. They personally characterise their own humour as being inept, yet once again, tests show that they are no different from other people at making witty remarks and humour.Ruch, W., Beermann, U., & Proyer, R. T. (2009). \\"Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?\\" Humor, 22, 111-143.  References   Further reading  * F√ºhr, M., Proyer, R. T., & Ruch, W.

The airfield is now London Stansted Airport. History Second World War Construction work began in August 1942 by US Engineers of the 817th Battalion. The site was used by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form. 344th Bombardment Group Stansted was officially opened on 7 August 1943 when the 30th Air Depot Group took up residence. The airfield was officially transferred to the Ninth Air Force on 16 October. The 344th Bombardment Group arrived at Stansted on 8 February 1944, from Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia, US, flying the twin-engine B-26 Marauder. Its operational squadrons and fuselage codes were 494th (K9), 495th (Y5), 496th (N3), and 497th (7I). On 30 September the 344th moved to their Advanced Landing Ground at Cormeilles-en-Vexin, France. 2nd Tactical Air Depot As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted airfield was a maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent. Postwar use After the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the Air Ministry and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes.Sturtivant 2007, page 183 In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war. The Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949, but the US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to NATO. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport returned to civil use in 1957, ending up under BAA control in 1966.

Epysode boasted an outstanding cast of musicians and vocalists, including Kristoffer Gildenl√∂w, L√©o Margarit (Pain of Salvation), Christophe Godin (Gn√¥, Metal Kartoon), Julien Spreutels (Ethernity), Kelly Sundown (Beyond Twilight, Darkology, Adagio), Oddleif Stensland (Communic), Liselotte Hegt (Ayreon, Dial) and Rick Altzi (At Vance, Thunderstone). The official videoclip for the song \\"Obsessions\\" was directed by Damien Brunet where Luyten plays the character \\"Esh - The Soul\\". In 2014, she was the last minute replacement for female singer Dilenya Mar in the band Beyond the Bridge with Herbie Langhans (Sinbreed, Voodoo Circle, Avantasia), which was the opening act for Serenity's \\"War of Ages European Tour\\". In October 2015, she was announced as the new vocalist of French band Nightmare. Their new album Dead Sun was released by AFM Records on 26 November 2016. In September 2017, she once again joined Arjen Lucassen and performed live for the 3-night live Ayreon Universe concert.

The team has competed in Sports Sedans, Australian GT, Formula Holden, and most notably as a touring car team competing in the V8 Supercar Championship Series. The team last competed in historic motor racing and the Australian GT Championship but was folded at the end of the 2009 season. Early years John Briggs, a Queenslander who relocated to Adelaide in the early 1980s due to work commitments, drove a Repco Holden powered Matich A50 Formula 5000 to a surprise second place at the 1978 Australian Grand Prix held at Sandown Raceway in Melbourne. Briggs finished two laps behind race winner Graham McRae after many of the pre-race favourites race such as Kevin Bartlett, Alfredo Costanzo, Vern Schuppan, Garrie Cooper, and reigning Australian Drivers' Champion John McCormack, had all experienced various problems or had crashed out of the race. Briggs raced a Chevrolet Monza (Dekon chassis #1001Aussie Monza's) for its owner, John Roberts, which was formerly run in the American- based IMSA GT Championship by Dekon part owner and expatriate Australian Horst Kwech. Roberts had the Monza re-built by Adelaide-based company K&A; Engineering for Briggs and he raced it in the Australian Sports Sedan Championship. He later switched from the Monza to an ex-JPS Team BMW 318i Turbo in the Australian GT Championship, before moving back into open wheelers with a Ralt RT21 Formula Holden in 1989. K&A; Engineering ran Briggs in both vehicles. Briggs again competed in Sports Sedans during the early-mid 1990s, winning the 1996 Australian Sports Sedan Championship with a Honda Prelude- Chevrolet. V8 Supercars Briggs Motor Sport made its debut in the 1997 in a Ford EF Falcon for team owner John Briggs, in 1998 it campaigned an EL Falcon, a year later it expanded to a two car team with John Briggs driving an AU Falcon and executive of the team's leading sponsor, Supercheap Auto, Bob Thorn in the older EL Falcon from the year before. In September 1999, Briggs bolstered his operation after purchasing the Perth based PAE Motorsport team, absorbing the Caterpillar backed Ford of John Bowe into the team.Bowe and Johnson split after 11 years The Examiner 12 December 1998 The team ran a single car for the next few seasons, the team sacking Bowe after Bathurst in 2001, replacing him with emerging New Zealand driver Simon Wills. In 2002 the team expanded to three cars with Betta Electrical Fords for veteran Tony Longhurst and Brazilian open wheel driver Max Wilson. Both drivers were replaced in 2003 with Paul Radisich and Dean Canto for the 2003 season but by August, Briggs had sold the V8 Supercar operation to British outfit Triple Eight Race Engineering, to establish an Australian arm of the race team led by Roland Dane, Derek Warwick and Ian Harrison. Briggs stepped back from professional racing at this point and spent several years away from the sport before investing in some historic racing cars, highlighted by the return of the 1985 Veskanda-Chevrolet sports car to race tracks in 2007. Since then Briggs has expanded his operation into the Australian GT Championship, driving and importing Moslers. After a diagnosis of prostate cancer, Briggs recently announced his retirement from competitive motorsports. He then sold the VesKanda to Perth based racer Paul Stubber, who would take the car to drive in the Historic Group C sports car races held in Europe during 2012.

The old name of the village was K√º√ß√ºk ≈ûana (Small ≈ûana). Many years ago, the village economically depended on a small coastal town near the east of the Black Sea named ≈ûana. This small town had two villages. The name of the first one was K√º√ß√ºk ≈ûana while that of the second one was B√ºy√ºk ≈ûana (Great ≈ûana); in the period of the Turkish Republic (i.e. after 1923), the first village's name became √áukurk√∂y or √áukur K√∂y√º. The population is 750 people. The village economy depends on agriculture, its main product being hazelnuts. A small river, K√º√ß√ºk ≈ûana Deresi (Small ≈ûana River), passes through the village. Migration to urban areas has meant a sharp population decline and an aging population. The meaning of ≈ûana Two myths relate to the origins of the name of ≈ûana. The first one is related to the 16th-century traveler Evliya √áelebi. It is said he pronounced \\"≈ûahane\\" when visiting the village. This word means \\"glorious\\", \\"tremendous\\", or \\"fantastic\\" in the Turkish language, the word itself being derived from the Persian language.

In 1860 it had a circulation of approximately 1,500.Carlebach, Ezriel, et al. (2007). \\"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. vol. 1\\\\. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. p. 670-671. Available online via Encyclopedia.com. It was read not only in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands but also in Eastern Europe, and continued to appear until 1922. At the time of its founding several Jewish journals had recently been launched in Germany ‚Äì Sulamith (1806-1843), Jedidja (1817-1831), and Abraham Geiger's Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f√ºr J√ºdische Theologie (1835-1847), as well as the Unparteiische Universal-Kirchenzeitung (1837), of Julius Vinzenz H√∂ninghaus, which had a Jewish section edited by Michael Hess and Isaac Markus Jost ‚Äì and Philippson recognized that none had kept pace with the needs of the times.Kayserling, Meyer (1898). Ludwig Philippson: eine Biographie. Leipzig: Hermann Mendelsohn. p. 55.Singer, Isidore (1906). \\"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums.\\" Jewish Encyclopedia. New York: Funk and Wagnalls. He aimed to produce a journal for the intelligent lay person that would both advance knowledge of Jewish history and plead the cause of the Jews of his day. The first number of the paper appeared May 2, 1837, and was published by Baumg√§rtner in Leipzig with the subtitle \\"Unparteiisches Organ f√ºr Alles J√ºdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde, und Belletristik\\" (Impartial Organ for All Matters of Jewish Interest Pertaining to Politics, Religion, Literature, History, Philology, and Belles-lettres). During the first two years the paper appeared three times per week. For a year and a half a supplement was published three times a month, devoted to literature and homiletics. In the course of 1839 it was first published twice weekly and then eventually became a weekly. Isidore Singer, writing in 1906, highlighted the paper's editorial independence, noting that it had not ever received a subsidy from any Jewish body, and that during the revolutions of 1848, \\"when the publication of nearly all other Jewish journals was interrupted, the Allgemeine Zeitung braved the storm and spoke out plainly in the political turmoil.\\" According to I. M. Jost, who devoted a chapter to the journal in his Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten (1847),Jost, Israel Mark. \\"Ludwig Philippson, Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums,\\" chapter 16, in: Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten, vol. 3. Breslau: Jacobsohn, 1847. p. 149-156. the Allgemeine Zeitung \\"became epoch- making in Jewish history by attempting for the first time to give a general view of the life and conditions of the Jews.\\"Translation as cited in Singer (1906), Jewish Encyclopedia. Philippson's chief aim was the civil emancipation of the Jews, carrying on the fight for that cause in the spirit of Gabriel Riesser's earlier periodical Der Jude (1832-1835). The paper was a voice for moderate religious reform, focusing attention on the organization of religious instruction, the form of worship in the synagogue, and the cultivation of all branches of Jewish learning. It also advocated for closer relations with non- Jews. It exercised considerable influence on Judaism in general, and, in particular, on the evolution of Judaism in Germany. It played a role in the establishment of a rabbinical seminary (Lehranstalt f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judenthums) in Berlin, and of a Jewish Publication Society (Institut zur F√∂rderung der Israelitischen Literatur), as well as the calling together of a Jewish synod (Leipzig, 1869). From the outset the Allgemeine Zeitung met with success, drawing the interest of cultured Jewish circles of Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Within the first months of its publication a society of students in Leyden (Netherlands) had formed to aid its circulation, and it even obtained several hundred subscribers in Poland. During the first years of its existence the paper had among its collaborators a number of the most distinguished scholars, including Gabriel Riesser, E. Carmoly, J. L. Saalsch√ºtz, S. D. Luzzatto, Leopold Zunz, Leopold Dukes, Julius F√ºrst, Leopold L√∂w, Franz Delitzsch, Adolph Jellinek, Abraham Geiger, and I. M. Jost. During the first year Phoebus Philippson, brother of Ludwig, contributed a series of 11 articles under the title \\"Ideas for an Encyclopedia and a Methodology of Jewish Theology.\\" In the mid 1850s a supplement was published regularly, entitled J√ºdisches Volksblatt zur Belehrung und Unterhaltung auf J√ºdischem Gebiete (A Popular Jewish Journal for Instruction and Entertainment on Jewish Subjects). After Philippson's death Gustav Karpeles assumed the editorship, beginning with the issue of February 9, 1890. Under his tenure the paper's interests shifted toward the lives and situation of the Jews of Eastern Europe. At that time a change was made in the format so that the literary part, which formed the bulk of the paper, was separated from the part containing the news. The latter was paged separately as a supplement entitled Der Gemeindebote, which continued to appear until 1922. In 1890 the journal was acquired by Rudolf Mosse and from then on was published in Berlin. Later, beginning in the second half of 1920, the journal appeared only once every two weeks. It ceased publication with the issue of April 28, 1922,See the overview of the complete digital edition, found in the \\"Compact Memory\\" digital archive of German-Jewish periodicals, hosted online at the Goethe Universit√§t, Frankfurt am Main. and was succeeded by the C.V.-Zeitung (C.V.-Newspaper), the organ of the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith).See editorial notice, Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, April 28, 1922, p. 1.

It was founded in 1932 as a publisher of scholarly editions of Early music that had never been previously published. Its specialist recording arm, developed from the 1960s onwards, grew into a specialist label that is now a part of Decca. History The company was financed and established in Paris in 1932 by Louise Dyer (later Hanson-Dyer), an Australian pianist and philanthropist. Dyer had settled in France two years earlier and energetically amassed a collection of manuscripts and printed music, lyrics and dissertations of the Early, Baroque and Classical music periods. \\"L'Oiseau-Lyre\\", the French name for the Australian lyrebird, was chosen by her; the company logo was a representation of the (displaying male) bird's tail. Dyer's aim was to produce historical editions of European composers of the 15th to 19th Centuries. The first project was an Oeuvres compl√®tes (Complete Works) of Fran√ßois Couperin. No expense was spared in scholarship or printing, and the resulting 12-volume collection was published in 1933, the 200th anniversary of the composer's death. She was appointed chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1934 in recognition of this achievement. She moved the company to Monaco in 1948 after a hiatus attributable to WWII. Louise died in 1962, and her (second) husband Jeff Hanson continued publication of fine editions, but moved the company's focus to producing high-quality recordings. Jeff Hanson died the following year but Margarita M. Hanson, his second wife, continued to run the publishing business until 1996. Under her guidance, the 25-volume Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century was published, followed by the Magnus Liber Organi and Le Grand Clavier series, much with the substantial collaboration and financial assistance of the University of Melbourne.current publications of √âditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre Margarita retired in 1995, and control of the company was passed to Davitt Moroney, a harpsichordist and music scholar who had been with the firm since 1981. Following Davitt Moroney‚Äôs departure in 2001, Kenneth Gilbert became Pr√©sident d√©l√©gu√©, bringing the seven-volume Magnus Liber Organi series to conclusion. A number of new editions were also released, including Louis Couperin‚Äôs Organ works and revised reprints of earlier Oiseau-Lyre editions. Les √âditions de l‚ÄôOiseau-Lyre ended its presence in Europe in 2013, reverting to the parent holding, Lyrebird Press, at the University of Melbourne. The Hanson-Dyer collection is now in the Louise Hanson-Dyer Music Library at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Record Label The recording arm of Oiseau-Lyre developed by Jeff Hanson produced an extensive catalogue of hundreds of LP records featuring rare and previously unrecorded Early and Baroque music, often performed by young artists. Oiseau-Lyre was the first record company to issue 33rpm LPs in France. The technical side of the recordings was handled by engineers from the Decca Recording Company. In 1970, Hanson sold the recording branch to Decca, which continued using the Oiseau- Lyre name as their specialised Early music label. Peter Wadland took over as label manager of L'Oiseau-Lyre and developed a recording partnership with the Academy of Ancient Music. Many noted Oiseau-Lyre recordings feature performances by artists on \\"period instruments\\", including fortepiano recordings of the Beethoven piano sonatas played by Malcolm Binns, a collection of Henry Purcell's theatre music directed by Christopher Hogwood, and a number of recordings by The Consort of Musicke and Anthony Rooley.

The radical design was to be powered by two axial-flow turbojets with an unusual blended wing-body canard design capable of 612 mph (985 km/h) in level flight. The USAAF rejected the 1942 proposal, but the effort speeded the development of the USAAF's first successful operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star which did see limited service near the end of war. The P-80 was a less radical design with a single British- based Allison J33 engine, with a conventional tail, but it retained a wing which was the same shape as the outer wing sections of the P-38 Lightning. Development The Lockheed aviation company was the first in the United States to start work on a jet-powered aircraft, the L-133 design started in 1939 as a number of \\"Paper Projects\\" by engineers Clarence L. \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, Willis M. Hawkins and Hall L. Hibbard. By 1940 preliminary work on a company- financed jet fighter had been started, which progressed to several different versions on the drawing board. In the meantime, Lockheed was working on an axial-flow L-1000 turbojet engine of their own design, which was intended to power the culmination of the twin-engine jet fighter project, the Model L-133-02-01. Throughout World War II, the development of a jet-powered fighter had the potential to bring a decisive advantage in the air battles of the war; as history played out, only Germany built significant numbers of jet fighters before the war ended, but they reached service in the Luftwaffe too late to make a difference. On March 30, 1942, Lockheed formally submitted the L-133-02-01 to the USAAF for consideration.Norton 2008, p. 221 Powered by two L-1000 turbojets and featuring a futuristic-appearing canard design with slotted flaps to enhance lift, the single-seat fighter was expected to have a top speed of in level flight, but a range of only The L-133 had a main wing shape that was essentially identical to the outer wing sections of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. In many respects the L-133 was far ahead of its time, with futuristic features including: * canard layout; * blended wing-body planform; and, * two engines in a very low-drag integral fuselage location. The USAAF considered the L-133 to be too advanced for the time, and did not pursue the project. The experience gained with the design served Lockheed well in the development of the USAAF's first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star. Although entering service after the war had ended, the P-80 was less advanced than the L-133. Because the USAAF didn't give the L-133 project the go-ahead, the advanced engines intended for the L-133 had long pauses in their development. The most expedient engine choice for the P-80 thus became the Allison J33, based on British centrifugal compressor designs. The P-80 was a cheap-to-build single-engine aircraft with a conventional wing and tailplane design, not using the blended wing-body and canard layout of the L-133.

They are axial twin spool turbojets with a can-annular type combustion element, typically operated as turboshaft engines. In this configuration the gas generator provides the expanding gases to drive a power or ‚ÄúFree Turbine‚Äù. This turbine is then used to drive electrical generators, mechanical pumps or propellers for marine applications. The GG4 is a self-contained; self- regulating; remote operated; quick responding; peaking power generating set, that can also be used for electric propulsion in naval vessels and to drive gas compressors for water and gas pipelines. It was introduced in the 1960s with approximately 1,300 units in operation at its peak. Many units are still in operation globally today. The typical output of a single engine ranges from 16 to 30 MW depending on conditions and configuration. Engines can be combined to work in conjunction with up to 8 other engines for more efficient power generation. They may also be operated as a combined cycle unit in combination with a condensate boiler in order to increase efficiency.

The character was introduced in the series premiere on March 23, 1987 and has been a regular fixture ever since. Ronn Moss played the role since the beginning, and was one of four remaining original cast members for 25 years, along with Susan Flannery, John McCook and Katherine Kelly Lang. During a leave of absence in 1992, Moss was briefly replaced by Lane Davies. The character's fate was uncertain when Moss departed the role in 2012, although head-writer Bradley Bell confirmed in an interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide that he had plans for a recast should Moss choose not to return to the series. In October 2013, TV Guide's Michael Logan reported that the role of Ridge was recast with former All My Children actor, Thorsten Kaye. Kaye made his first appearance as Ridge on December 13, 2013. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Denise Richards' husband Aaron Phypers has appeared as Ridge in love scenes with Shauna in 2020. Kaye's performance has been met with critical acclaim, garnering him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2020. Development Characterization Actor Ronn Moss originated the role of Ridge, portraying the role for twenty-five years, from 1987 until his departure in 2012. Ridge Forrester is described as: \\"Currently CEO and the driving force behind Forrester Creations Empire. His biggest fan is Mick, Ridge is this debonair designer spent his entire life believing that he was Eric‚Äôs biological son, only to later learn that he‚Äôs not biologically Eric's son at all, but rather the son of shipping tycoon Massimo Marone, and half brother to sailor, Nick, but that never changed the FACT that he is a Forrester legally and will always be a Forrester. He is father to Thomas, Steffy, and RJ, and stepfather to Hope, the one-time conflicted lover has finally settled down with Brooke, the true love of his life.\\" In December 2013 during an interview with TV Guide, executive producer Bradley Bell talked about a significant change in Ridge's personality following the recasting of the role. He described, \\"He's become very introspective about the first chapter of his life, and the highs and lows of being married to a woman like Brooke. He's been working, traveling, keeping a low profile and really trying to analyze himself and the mistakes he's made. He's been thinking a lot about what he wants for the remainder of his life.\\" Departure In August 2012, it was announced that Moss had decided to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after 25 years of being on the series. He will exit the series on September 14, 2012. When approached about the possibility of a recast following Moss' exit, series executive producer Bradley Bell confessed, \\"I might go a little younger but we'll be true to the age range that's been established. I do have people in mind in terms of a recast ‚Äì some very interesting people.\\" Bell also revealed that the character would return at some point in the future, whether it was Moss portraying the role or not. He revealed: Bell later announced he would recast the role, should Moss choose not to return, and had several high- profile actors in mind. On October 15, 2013, it was announced that former All My Children star Thorsten Kaye was recast in the role of Ridge. He made his on-screen debut on December 13, 2013. Bradley Bell explained that Kaye was at the top of his list for a Ridge recast and even considered bringing him to the series prior to the recast. He said, \\"I've had Thorsten on a list of several possible Ridges for a long time. Some of the actors on that list came from daytime, others had never done daytime before.\\" Storylines 1987‚Äì2012 Ridge Forrester is the son of Eric and Stephanie Forrester (until a 2001 storyline changes his paternity), the oldest of the five Forrester children: Thorne, Kristen, Felicia and Angela.The existence of the microcephalic Angela was an early retcon in the series, but a later retcon reveals that the Angela viewers meet is an imposter who has been pretending to be Angela since adolescence. Still another retcon seemed to occur in the December 18, 2008 episode (#5463), in which Stephanie refers to Angela having died as a baby. He is initially portrayed as an arrogant playboy who fully enjoys his status as the favored son. Yet, like Eric, Ridge is a talented designer and soon becomes a central part of the family company, fashion house Forrester Creations. He dates the virginal heiress, Caroline Spencer. They fall in love and set a wedding date, but right before the wedding, Caroline finds out Ridge had a last minute fling and she collapsed at the wedding. Ridge didn't realize he really loved Caroline until she breaks up with him. She went on to marry his brother Thorne and Ridge ventured into a romance with Brooke Logan. Ridge moved Brooke in with him, she became pregnant but miscarried their child. During her recuperation, Ridge went into an inebriated Caroline's bedroom while her husband Thorne was downstairs and had sex with Caroline. Caroline thought he was Thorne but much later \\"confessed\\" she knew it was Ridge. Caroline and Ridge still loved each other. Caroline finally left Thorne and went to Ridge, Ridge broke up with Brooke, and they were married. Caroline died after being diagnosed with leukemia. Caroline‚Äôs dying wish is for Ridge to be with Brooke, the two reunite. Riddled with guilt Ridge seeks council from Taylor Hayes, a beautiful psychiatrist who counseled Ridge upon Caroline‚Äôs death. Ridge and Taylor are attracted to each other. This results in Brooke instantly clashing with Taylor, as Brooke cannot believe that Ridge could love another woman. Ridge waffles between the two women for a while but ultimately decides to marry Taylor. They wed in a beautiful ceremony which Brooke attempted to stop to make the announcement that she is pregnant. Brooke is unsure about the father of the baby since she had slept with both Ridge and Eric, Ridge‚Äôs father. Ridge was declared the father after a paternity test. While Brooke wanted Ridge to raise her baby with her and leave Taylor, Ridge chose to honor his marriage and stay with Taylor. By the time Taylor is presumed dead in a plane crash, Brooke is engaged to Taylor's associate, James Warwick. Ridge initially encourages their relationship, but he ends up crashing their wedding. He and Brooke soon marry instead. Taylor was rescued by Prince Omar and married him. When Taylor turns up alive, Ridge initially chooses to stay with Brooke because of the children, but goes back to his true wife (his marriage to Brooke was ruled invalid). This sets in motion a bitter rivalry between Brooke and Taylor. In an attempt to make Ridge jealous, Brooke threatens to elope with Grant, an old friend of Taylor's who has come to work at Forrester Creations, if Ridge doesn't agree to remarry her. When Ridge refuses, she goes through with the wedding, not knowing that Ridge left Taylor at their engagement party to race to the port to try to stop her from marrying Grant. She also gives Grant control of Forrester Creations. When her son Rick shoots Grant, Ridge takes the blame and while waiting to be sentenced, he spills his heart to Taylor confessing it was her he always loved. When Ridge is released, Taylor is pregnant. However, when she goes to tell him she is pregnant, she catches Brooke and Ridge in bed, she decides to tell everyone Thorne, who she has been living with, and went on vacation to Hawaii, is the father. Taylor didn't know that Brooke staged the scene, getting Ridge drunk and out of his shirt and he still refused to make love to her. The truth about Thomas Forrester in fact being Ridge's son comes out, and he annuls his marriage to Brooke and returns to Taylor. In 1999, identical twin daughters, Steffy and Phoebe, are born.The history of the twins was later revised to make them fraternal, so that two different actresses could play them. Several ordeals undermine his happiness during the marriage. His old lover, Morgan DeWitt, tricks him into getting her pregnant. A physical confrontation with Taylor leads to Morgan miscarrying, which in turn leads to her kidnapping Steffy, faking the child's death and passing the girl off as her own. Morgan eventually has both Taylor and the child held captive; but Ridge manages to save them both. Taylor is killed by Eric's ex wife, Sheila Carter. Ridge also learns he isn't Eric's son, but the son of billionaire shipping magnate Massimo Marone (even Stephanie didn't know this), Stephanie's best friend. Ridge returns to Brooke. When Ridge, Brooke and series newcomer Nick Marone are kidnapped by Sheila, Ridge falls into a fire furnace, and presumed dead. A grieving Brooke collapsed in front of the furnace and Nick \\"comforted\\" her by having sex with her, on the foundry floor! However Ridge is actually alive, returning three days later. She gives birth to R.J. Forrester, Ridge's child (originally thought to be Nick's child, later revealed as Ridge's). Brooke tosses between Nick (who she now loves) and Ridge. She chooses Nick in the end. Brooke returns to Ridge, but he leaves her for Taylor, who returned from the dead; Brooke knew she was alive but did not tell anyone. In reality, she was kidnapped by Prince Omar to recover from her wounds. Stephanie faked a heart attack, and convinced Ridge to marry Taylor as her \\"dying\\" wish. When her lies were exposed, Ridge still goes through with the wedding. Taylor tells Ridge the truth about her sleeping with James Warwick many years ago in a serious emotional time where both thought they were dying; Ridge tells her that the hypocrisy of the standard she has always held others, namely Brooke, up to is what he can't forgive. So Ridge returns to Brooke, however she rejects him, choosing Nick instead. When Nick and Brooke marry, Ridge suffers from a heart attack, literally a broken heart, according to his diagnosis. Stephanie realizes and accepts that Ridge really does love Brooke. Brooke returns to L.A after leaving to support Ridge, however remains with Nick. Ridge dated Brooke's sister, Donna, hoping Brooke will be jealous. After Bridget and Nick sleep together, Brooke wants Ridge back, however he rejects her; he has his eye on the new chemist at Forrester Originals, Ashley Abbott (a character who had been well established years earlier on The Young and the Restless). They have a brief relationship, and engage however he breaks it off to be with Brooke again after Brooke is savagely beaten and raped by Andy. Brooke leans on Ridge, who is very supportive and goes to counseling with her. When a man named Shane McGrath dies, Ridge took Shane's body out on Nick's boat, The Shady Marlin, and dumped it in the ocean. Ridge is blamed (despite not killing Shane). He is jailed and released. Rick ends up in a relationship with Taylor, however Taylor breaks it off as she still loves Ridge. This results in a fist-fight between Ridge and Rick. Rick falls off a building and ends up paralyzed. In 2009, Ridge and Taylor becoming close again after their daughter Phoebe is killed in a car accident, in a car which Rick was driving. They protect their daughter, Steffy from Rick after she shows interest in him as well. Steffy and Rick break up. Taylor gives Ridge pills for stress, however he starts to overdose himself without Taylor's knowledge; Taylor gets in bed with him and they have sex. He leaves Brooke and he's ready to marry Taylor. Steffy and Thomas send texts to Brooke, misleading her about the wedding. But at the last minute Brooke interrupts the ceremony, arriving on a horse, and, after a short period, Ridge leaves Taylor's house and reunites with Brooke. In 2010, at Hope's graduation party where all the females are dressed alike and all the males are dressed alike and are wearing masks, Brooke has sex with Oliver Jones, Hope Logan's teenage boyfriend. Oliver thinks Brooke is Hope. Hope is angry with both of them and dumps Oliver. Ridge pardons Brooke and doesn't react at all. In 2011, Taylor's and Ridge's son, Thomas, set out to promote their Forrester Creations Line called \\"Taboo\\" but end up in a plane crash and get stranded on an island. They return, and Taylor consumes poisonous berries that are brought back, assumed to trigger a sexual anxiety when consumed. Stephanie promises Thomas her shares of Forrester creation at her death if he will lie, so Thomas and Stephanie lie and tell everyone that Thomas and Brooke had sex on the Island. Ridge returned to Taylor, and nearly married her because of this. The truth came out and he returned to Brooke and basically disowned his son, Thomas. He left Taylor heartbroken and she is now dating Thorne. Also Ridge is stunned when he learns that his daughter Steffy married Hope's fiancee Liam Spencer in Aspen. Despite whatever doubts he may have about the marriage, Ridge supports his daughter's decision to marry Liam while Brooke doesn't. When Liam ends his marriage to Steffy and reunites with Hope, Ridge expresses his personal concerns while Brooke is happy that her daughter is finally with the man she loves. Ridge proposes to Brooke in Italy. Stephanie offers to organise the wedding at her house; it was a simple ceremony with only family as guests. Ridge and Brooke leave for their honeymoon after the speeches have taken place. While on their honeymoon, Brooke is in touch with Deacon via one text concerning Hope, and Ridge finds out, but when he asks Brooke about it, she denies it. Ridge tells Brooke he can no longer take the lies and tells her he will not be returning home with her. Brooke arrives home without Ridge to deal with Katie. Ridge leaves his son Thomas in charge of Forrester Creations as interim CEO. 2013‚Äìpresent Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) returns to L.A. in December 2013 and reconnects with Brooke, but breaks things off when he learns of her affair with Bill Spencer, Jr. Katie, Brooke's youngest sister, thought she was going to die, but was going through postpartum psychosis. She wanted Brooke to take care of Bill and Will, so arranged circumstances for Brooke and Bill to fall in love and raise Baby Will together. Everyone blames Brooke's affair with Bill on Ridge leaving Brooke on their honeymoon and spending one year away in Paris. Brooke and Ridge decide to remarry, but Katie and Ridge have connected and have feelings for each other. Katie fakes a fainting spell at the wedding. Ridge begins dating Brooke's sister Katie Logan, which angers a jealous Brooke and Eric, who wants Ridge and Brooke together. Eric tells Ridge that if he breaks up with Katie and gets together with Brooke he will appoint Ridge CEO of Forrester Creations. Eric makes Brooke and Ridge co-vice presidents with Rick still serving as president. Katie and Ridge become engaged and Bill seizes the opportunity for another chance with Brooke. Bill and Brooke travel to Abu Dhabi for their marriage, which is stopped by Ridge when he learns of Bill's one night stand with Quinn Fuller. An enraged Bill orders his right hand man Justin Barber, who was secretly piloting the helicopter Ridge and Brooke were on, to dump Ridge into the Persian Gulf. After an extensive search Brooke finds Ridge on the beach but he has suffered memory loss and has lost the ability to draw. Ridge blames Bill for his loss of drawing but finds that he is learning to draw again by working with Rick's wife and Bill's niece Caroline Spencer. Eric says he will step down as CEO to travel more with his brother John and will decide on a successor between Ridge and Rick. As Caroline and Ridge work together alone on the new couture line they share a few kisses and declare their attraction for each other. Katie becomes jealous of Caroline's ability to understand Ridge and help him draw again but tells Ridge not to use Caroline to attain the CEO position. Eric chooses Ridge as the new CEO but changes his mind when he learns about Ridge and Caroline kissing. During a business meeting, Maya told everyone that Ridge and Caroline were having an affair. Though Caroline is crying and begging for Rick's forgiveness, Ridge stands quietly. Rick is angered and hurt and begins an affair with the greedy and opportunistic Maya Avant, who convinces Rick to accept the CEO position. Rick uses his new role as CEO to enact revenge on Ridge and Caroline. Ridge and Katie's relationship is strained and a vengeful Katie tells Bill, who gets into a fight with Ridge. Caroline wants to have a relationship with Ridge but he tells her to work things out with Rick. Eric orders Rick to end his affair with Maya or he will fire him as CEO. Rick devises a scheme where it appears he has returned to Caroline until he is secure in his position at Forrester Creations. However, Rick continues his affair with Maya until he was able to gain irrevocable control of the company from Eric. Once he achieves this, he leaves Caroline and moves Maya into the Forrester Mansion, and replaces Stephanie's portrait above the fireplace with one of Maya. Rick finds Ridge and Caroline making out with each other in the design office and shoots at them with a gun that he stole from Eric. Eric, finally realizes Rick is dangerous and unstable, uses the morality clause in Rick's contract to fire Rick and make Ridge CEO. Katie then breaks off her engagement with Ridge as his relationship with Caroline progresses. Caroline takes a trip to New York to visit Karen and Danielle, and is severely injured when she is hit by a car. Upon returning to L.A., she moves in with Ridge and they begin to plan their future. He helps her to recuperate. However, Ridge finds out that he cannot father children as a result of an irreversible vasectomy he had while living in Paris, and ends his relationship with Caroline so that she can find someone who can give her children. Ridge does not tell Caroline about his inability to father children, and instead confides in Brooke. Caroline then takes anti-anxiety medication that she stole from Pam's desk and starts drinking. While drunk and drugged in a hotel room, she calls Thomas (now played by Pierson Fode), and they have sex. The next morning, after realizing what happened, Caroline returns to Ridge. A few weeks later, Caroline finds out she is pregnant, and Ridge tells her that he can't be the father. Caroline then confesses to having sex with Thomas and he is her baby's father. Caroline and Ridge decide to keep the baby's paternity a secret as Ridge believes that Thomas took advantage of Caroline and is too immature to raise a child. The baby is born, and they decide to name him Douglas, after Stephanie. Thomas begins bonding with Douglas, and Ridge and Caroline eventually reveal the truth after being blackmailed by Brooke and Bill. Ridge then ends his marriage to Caroline so that Thomas, Caroline, and Douglas can be a family. Ridge then decides to go after Brooke, despite the fact that she is in a relationship with Bill. Ridge then stops Brooke and Bill's attempted wedding after R.J. (now recast and aged to 16) returns home from boarding school and convinces Ridge that he belongs with Brooke. Ridge and Brooke eventually reunite and get engaged when Ridge proposes on Christmas Day, 2016. Despite being recommitted to Brooke, Ridge starts to develop feelings for Eric's new wife Quinn Fuller, after he accidentally sees her naked while taking an outdoor shower. When Ridge tries to get Quinn out of Eric's life for ruining Steffy and Liam's life by massaging her sprained foot, being in a steam room together, and having her in a compromising situation at a hotel out of the country. Quinn quickly learns of Ridges plan and threatens to expose him to Eric, however when Quinn tells Ridge of her childhood and why she was so mad at the world, Ridge understands her, and kisses her. Ridge and Quinn would continue to have an affair behind Brooke and Eric's back. Katie then becomes suspicious of Quinn and Ridge, and tells Brooke about her suspicions. Brooke doesn't believe Katie, and goes to look for Ridge and catches him kissing Quinn. Brooke calls off their engagement, and goes back to Bill and marries him. Sheila Carter returns to L.A after being accused of trying to kill Quinn. Sheila with the help of Charlie learns of Ridge and Quinn's affair and tells Eric. Ridge and Quinn confesses to Eric on their affair and Eric kicks Quinn and Ridge out the mansion. When Steffy demanded Ridge tell her what he did to Eric, Ridge reveals to Steffy about him and Quinn. Steffy asks Ridge if he is in love with Quinn, Ridge tells his daughter that he is not, and that he hopes that Eric does not divorce Quinn. When Ridge visits Eric at a motel, he tells Ridge that he is no longer is son and that he betrayed him again, but later would forgives Ridge. Brooke talks to Ridge about divorcing Bill and that she has seen his true colors. Brooke never tells Ridge that she left him for burning down Spectra, but tells him that he punched Liam. Ridge works to get Brooke to take him back but has competition, when his young brother Thorne (Ingo Rademacher) who returns from Paris, and wants Brooke and his CEO position. However Ridge wins Brooke back after Bill sign the divorce papers, and marries her at the Forester mansion, and has Thorne as his best man. Reception In his column of the newspaper Gettysburg Times on January 10, 1990, John N. Goudas discussed Ridge: \\"You have to hand it to Ridge Forrester. That handsome devil on The Bold and the Beautiful. In love with two women, Caroline and Brooke, he played a stalling game for 3 years, and got away with it. In December (1989) the writers finally cleared up Ridge's conscience and finally made a decision in favor of Caroline, the unhappy wife of his brother Thorne,\\" not knowing that after years of turmoil Brooke would emerge as his true love (even after another woman, Taylor Hayes, had a life with Ridge). Ronn Moss said on his character (in the very early stages) \\"Ridge has developed since the show began. He is less devious, and more respectful than others. Besides, he had a problem that was uncommon; he was in love with two ladies.\\" Connie Passalacqua from The Rock Hill Herald said at the show's inception: \\"Even the most hardened feminist would swoon at the sight of Ronn Moss, Ridge Forrester [...] Ridge has been shown at various angles, sunning his ripply muscled bod by the Forrester swimming pool\\". Passalacqua also commented on the character's looks and touching on the beauty and good looks of the show's cast, embodying the title Bold and Beautiful at its very best.

He was elected and sworn in as the President of Vanuatu on 2 September 2009. Biography Personal life Abbil is from Tanna island, which is located in Vanuatu's southernmost Tafea Province. He was born in the village of Louaneai on Tanna in the New Hebrides in 1942 to parents George Yaviniau and Nassuaiu. His father originally owned his own store, but closed the business after Iolu later suggested the family join a business cooperative. Abbil holds the chiefly title of Yaniniko, which means chief's spokesman on the island of Tanna. His hereditary title was granted to him by his grandfather, Joe Yautim, who was a Yaramara, or chief, on Tanna.

Biography  Moseneke was born in Pretoria and went to school there. He joined the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) at the age of 14.\\"Honorary degree citation: Dikgang Moseneke\\", Wits University. The following year he was arrested, detained and convicted of participating in anti-apartheid activity. He spent ten years as a prisoner on Robben Island, where he met and befriended Nelson Mandela and other leading activists. While imprisoned he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in English and political science and a B.Iuris degree, and would later complete a Bachelor of Laws, all from the University of South Africa. He also served on the disciplinary committee of the prisoners' self-governed association football body, Makana F.A.. Moseneke started his professional career as an Solicitor's articled clerk at Klagbruns Inc in Pretoria in 1973. He was admitted as an attorney in 1976 and practised for five years at Maluleke, Seriti and Moseneke, mainly before the Company Court in Liquidation matters and in Criminal Trials. In 1983 he was called to the Pretoria Bar. His application had sparked a dispute within the Bar which culminated in its abolishing its \\"whites-only\\" membership rule. Moseneke practised as an advocate in Johannesburg and Pretoria and was noted for his Company Law, Bankruptcy and Indirect Tax practise and was briefed extensively by Black and Asian businessmen. He was awarded senior counsel status ten years later. Moseneke worked underground for the PAC during the 1980s and became its Deputy President when it was unbanned in 1990. Moseneke also served on the technical committee that drafted the interim constitution of 1993. In 1994 he was appointed Deputy Chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission, which conducted the first democratic elections in South Africa.  Judicial career  In September 1994, while practising as a silk, Moseneke accepted an acting appointment to the Transvaal Provincial Division. Between 1995 and 2001, however, Moseneke left the Bar to pursue a full-time corporate career, most famously as the chair of Telkom. In November 2001 Moseneke was appointed to the High Court in Pretoria, his hometown, by then President Thabo Mbeki. A year later he was made a judge in the Constitutional Court and, in June 2005, became Deputy Chief Justice. On 4 November 2013, Moseneke was appointed Acting Chief Justice during the long-term leave of Mogoeng Mogoeng. Moseneke is regarded as one of the strongest judges on South Africa's Constitutional Court. For example, he has been praised for his \\"towering legal mind\\" and \\"commitment to fairness and justice\\" and described as \\"a most independent- minded and imaginative jurist\\". Moseneke's judgments include: *S v Thebus,Thebus and Another v S (2003) ZACC 12. which upheld the constitutional validity of the doctrine of common purpose; *Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board,Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board of the Eastern Cape (2006) ZACC 16. which details the relationship between public- and private-law remedies; *Masetlha v President,Masetlha v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another (2007) ZACC 20. which held National Intelligence Agency head Billy Masetlha was not entitled to procedural fairness when he was dismissed by then President Thabo Mbeki; *National Treasury v Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance,National Treasury and Others v Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance and Others (2012) ZACC 18. where the Court refused to grant an interim injunction to stop Gauteng's controversial e-tolls; *Mazibuko v Sisulu,Mazibuko v Sisulu and Another (2013) ZACC 28. in which then leader of the opposition Lindiwe Mazibuko succeeded in obtaining an order declaring unconstitutional the parliamentary rules that allowed the National Assembly to stall, rather than proceed with, the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma that she had tabled; and *Minister of Police v Premier of the Western Cape,Minister of Police and Others v Premier of the Western Cape and Others (2013) ZACC 33. in which the Court found in favour of Premier of the Western Cape Helen Zille when the African National Congress sought to invalidate her creation of the Khayelitsha Commission. Also well-known are his two leading judgments on affirmative action, Minister of Finance v Van HeerdenMinister of Finance and Another v Van Heerden (2004) ZACC 3. and SAPS v Barnard.South African Police Service v Solidarity obo Barnard (2014) ZACC 23. Moseneke has made a significant contribution to South African property law. He penned the Constitutional Court's last three majority judgments on the Restitution of Land Rights ActDepartment of Land Affairs and Others v Goedgelegen Tropical Fruits (Pty) Ltd (2007) ZACC 12; Kwalindile Community v King Sabata Dalinyebo Municipality and Others; Zimbane Community v King Sabata Dalinyebo Municipality and Others (2013) ZACC 6; Florence v Government of the Republic of South Africa (2014) ZACC 22. and decided a leading case on expropriation in 2014.Arun Property Development (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town (2014) ZACC 37. The following year, in Shoprite v MEC, Eastern Cape, which dealt comprehensively with the meaning of the constitutional right to property, Moseneke's judgment attracted the most concurrences.Shoprite Checkers (Pty) Limited v Member of the Executive Council for Economic Development, Environmental Affairs And Tourism, Eastern Cape and Others (2015) ZACC 23. The courtroom of the Constitutional Court of South Africa Most celebrated is Moseneke's judgment in Glenister v President, co-authored with Justice Edwin Cameron, which struck down amendments to the National Prosecuting Act and South African Police Service Act on the basis that they failed to create an \\"adequately independent\\" anti-corruption unit.Glenister v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others (2011) ZACC 6 This was hailed as an \\"imaginative\\" and \\"brilliant\\" judgment by commentators and means South Africa must have an independent corruption-fighting agency notwithstanding the ruling ANC's controversial disbanding of the Scorpions. Before his judicial appointment, Moseneke had succeeded, as a litigant, in having South Africa's racially discriminatory system of estate administration declared constitutionally invalid.Moseneke and Others v Master of the High Court (2000) ZACC 27. Moseneke is also known for his independence. At public events he has distanced himself from ANC interests, criticised the government's flouting of court orders, and decried the extensive powers afforded the President - in each case triggering an angry response from the ruling party. Moseneke has twice been passed over for appointment as Chief Justice, despite being the most senior judge on the Court. On the second occasion, when Mogoeng was appointed, many prominent figures said Moseneke was the better candidate, and questioned the ANC's motives in snubbing him.\\"Moseneke for Chief Justice\\" Democratic Alliance press release. Mogoeng was one of the Constitutional Court's most junior members, having been appointed to it less than two years earlier, and having had a relatively short judicial career at one of the smallest High Court divisions prior to that. His nomination ahead of Moseneke reminded many of the notorious supersession by L. C. Steyn, a National Party favourite, of Oliver Schreiner. Finally, whereas Moseneke had been active in the struggle against apartheid, Mogoeng had been a prosecutor for a bantustan. Moseneke retired from the Constitutional Court in May 2016.  Other positions and awards  Moseneke has six honorary doctorates: from the University of the North, University of Natal, Tshwane University of Technology, University of South Africa, University of Cape Town and CUNY.

The screenplay is based on the novel Les Fian√ßailles de M. Hire by Georges Simenon. The film was released in the United States as Panic. It was shot at the Victorine Studios in Nice, with sets designed by the art director Serge Pim√©noff. In 1989 Patrice Leconte made a second film based on the same novel Monsieur Hire with Michel Blanc in the title role. Plot Alice is a young woman who has just been released from prison after taking the rap for a robbery committed by her boyfriend, Alfred. She arrives in town the night after a woman's murder. The next morning, Alice and Alfred pretend they are meeting for the first time, as the police know she covered up a crime for someone and are eager to discover the real criminal. Alice's neighbor, the eccentric and misanthropic loner Monsieur Hire, immediately falls for her. He warns her about Alfred, advising that she should ask him about the murder. Although Alfred is initially unforthcoming, he admits he is the murderer. He was sleeping with the woman and killed her for her money. When Alice tells him that Hire knows of his crime, he quickly sets a plan into action. He begins planting suspicions among the locals, who already dislike and distrust Hire. Meanwhile, Alice leads Hire on, and plants the murdered woman's handbag in his apartment. Later, Alfred tells his friends to gather Hire's neighbors, who search the apartment and find the handbag. After his friends incite a violent mob, Alfred urges Alice to call Hire and beg him to leave work and return home. When he arrives and is confronted by the bloodthirsty crowd, Hire flees to the rooftops, where he slips. Despite the efforts of police and firefighters to save him, he falls to his death. Alfred and a regretful Alice slink off, thinking they have successfully framed Hire. However, the police discover a photograph of Alfred committing the murder on Hire's body. They wait to close in on Alfred as the movie ends. Cast Assessments One study of French cinema places this film in its social and political context alongside other French films of the period: In the years immediately following World War II, filmmakers were judged according to how their films reflected their implicit judgement of the behavior of the French under German occupation. The tale of \\"mob misrule\\" and \\"scapegoating\\" is played out in a setting that includes all the prototypical elements that identify it as a microcosm of French society: the cafe bar and terrace, small shops, church, modest hotel, \\"the selling of veal cutlets and Camembert\\". Panique has been described as \\"a strong and memorable screen denunciation of the relations between French people in the confused aftermath of the war\\" and \\"a harsh but thoughtfully delineated portrait of a society riven by mistrust and suspicion\\". Duvivier commented with respect to the film that \\"we are far from people who love each other\\". Defenders of French society responded that his years in exile during the war made him unfit to assess the French society that emerged from the war. Later critics have appreciated how the film makes references to the French Revolution as well as to the very recent past with playful puns and allusions rather than forthright statements, allowing the viewer to make the connections. In this analysis, self-censorship and the political context that made a careful examination of the recent past impossible forced Duvivier \\"to speak in more highly elaborated codes. It is the constraints themselves that produce a film compelling enough to demand an unraveling, and that distinguish Panique from the more journalistic renderings of Occupation stories that were made in later decades.\\" References External links  * Panique at ‚ÄúCinema-francais‚Äú (French) *Panique: Panic Attack an essay by James Quandt at the Criterion Collection Category:French films Category:1947 films Category:French black-and-white films Category:French-language films Category:Films based on Belgian novels Category:Films based on works by Georges Simenon Category:Films directed by Julien Duvivier Category:Films shot at Victorine Studios Category:French crime drama films Category:1947 crime drama films Category:1947 drama films ","title":"Panique"},{"id":"24198426","text":"Toma Sokolov () (November 6, 1938 - December 21, 2011) was a Bulgarian sprint canoer who competed in the early 1960s.

It was built as a regular Order Castle with a forepart, a corner tower and wooden buildings in the yard. For 1341 Hasenpoth is called as belonging to the Commandery Goldingen and is in 1397 and 1430 explicitly referred to as the castle of the Order. Castle Hasenpoth gained importance as a border castle between religious and episcopal areas, the bishop maintained a castle here, so that these castles were referred to as Bishop Hasenpoth and Order Hasenpoth. In 15th century outside of the castle's walls was built new eastern block. The Order used it until Order collapse after Treaty of Vilnius (1561). During the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, the castle was restored and from that time the entrance gate retains plaster with rich and decorative decoration in sgraffito technique. During Second Northern War (1655‚Äì1660), the castle was devastated by the Swedish troops. In 1665 Jacob Kettler rebuilt castle and it garrison was reinforced with cannon team. In 1682 the castle became the property of von Michael Friedrich Nold. Lost Places & Unlost Places Baltikum. Kurland, Lettland E - K At this time castle lost it character of fortification and was rebuilt as a residential building still protected by castle walls. Gradually it importance as a residential building was also lost and it remained only partially occupied. In the second half of 18th century a new manor house was built near the castle mill pond on the other side. A mill, an alcohol brewery and a farmhouse were also built near the pond. In the beginning of the 19th century, the eastern part of the castle and the southeastern tower were built with smooth brick arches and new partitions. The old part of the castle was only partially inhabited, and the owners lived in the new manor house. From 1863 until the Latvia's agrarian reform of 1920s Aizpute manor house belonged to the Grothuss noble family. In 1939 the castle was adapted to the needs of the school. It was used until the mid-1970s, after which it was abandoned. In 1990 restoration work was started and surveys were conducted repeatedly. In 1997, a project for wall anchoring and roof construction was completed, partially implemented in the D-section. In 1999, the castle wall was conserved for a small section of the castle on the right wing, and a tile roof was placed.

In the basement of the castle, the barrel vault has been partially preserved.

The party was initially called Indonesian National Party - Merdeka ('Freedom'), and was formed on 23 July 1950 after a split within the Indonesian National Party (PNI). The divisions with the PNI had appeared at the party congress in May the same year, when Sidik Djojosukarto's followers (whom the founders of PNI-Merdeka/PRN opposed) had emerged victorious (after the split the PNI labelled the PRN as 'right-wing' and 'capitalistic'). Dr. Djody Gondokusumo was the chairman of the party. When the People's Representative Council was established following the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia and the establishment of Indonesia as a unitary state, the PRN was given 10 legislative seats. In October 1950, the PRN was the only non- government party to support the Natsir cabinet when a vote of confidence was held in parliament. Later in the same month, the party adopted the name PRN. As of 1951 the party claimed to have two million members, although that figure was probably highly inflated. In March 1951 the party joined ten other parties, including the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), in the Consultative Body of Political Parties, a nationalist coalition established as form for the PKI and the Indonesian National Party (PNI) to work together. However, the PNI refused to join the body, making it ineffective. When the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet was formed in 1953, the PRN leader Dr. Djody Gondokusumo was named Minister of Justice. In November 1953 he was joined by the PRN politician I Gusti Gde Rake, who became Minister of Agrarian Affairs. In the 1955 parliamentary election, the PRN gained 242,125 votes (0.64% of the national vote), and was awarded two seats in the 257-seat parliament. The PRN joined the National Progressive Fraction, a body of ten MPs from Java. In the Constitutional Assembly election held later the same year, it won 220.652 votes (0.58%), resulting in 3 seats in the 514-seat Constitutional Assembly. In 1956 the party suffered a split, as there was a division between the Javanese leadership (loyal to Dr. Gondokusumo) and a group of non-Javanese leaders (a headed by Bebasa Daeng Lalo). The Bebasa Daeng Lalo-faction counted on the support of two PRN ministers in the Burhanuddin Harahap cabinet, F. Laoh and Gunawan. In late 1956 the PRN expressed support for President Sukarno's konsepsi, which would lead to the establishment of the Guided Democracy. However, in January 1960 a new law came into effect that placed severe restrictions on the ideology, conduct and membership of political parties. The PRN failed to meet these requirements, and was dissolved along with all but ten of Indonesian's political parties. Women's wing The women's wing of PRN was known as Wanita Nasional ('National Woman'). As of 1960, Wanita Nasional claimed to have 90 branches.

Lafontaine, J. Donald and Robert W. Poole, 1995, Wedge Entomological Research Foundation, It is found in the western mountains of North America, from Alaska south to Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. Occurring mainly in the Pacific Northwest, it thrives in mid-to-high elevation conifer forest habitat, as well as some areas of coastal rain forest in the Coast range. However, it is also found in a non-contiguous range in sub-alpine forest in the Rocky Mountains, ranging from the state of Alberta in the north, to New Mexico in the south. The wingspan of an adult ranges between 34 and 36 mm. It is widespread, and a relatively common species. Behaviour Adults are on the wing from June to July, depending on the location. Adult females of the species lay a single brood of eggs each year. The moth is nocturnal, and will be attracted to lights. The plants upon which the moths' larvae feed are currently unknown. Description The two forewings are a dark shade of brown, whilst both hindwings are a much lighter shade of yellow, tipped with a wide marginal band of a darker yellow/brown shade. The forewing culminates in a rounded point, while the hindwing is more curved. There is also a curved white mark, curving from the anterior edge towards the outer edge. The species is identifiable through these characteristics, as well as the possession of a curved stigma. While the species shows some sexual dimorphism, the sexes are still hard to distinguish. The antenna of the male is filiform. The thorax is a darker shade than the abdomen, although both shades are intermediary to those of the wings.

The unit is stationed at Los Angeles Air Force Base, California. The 61st Air Base Group operates Los Angeles Air Force Base and supports the Space and Missile Systems Center. It is not currently clear whether as of December 2019 it was transferred to the United States Space Force. The unit's World War II predecessor unit, the 61st Troop Carrier Group was a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport unit assigned to both Twelfth and Ninth Air Forces in North Africa, Italy and Western Europe. The 61 TCG was highly decorated for its combat parachute infantry drops during the Invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky); Invasion of Italy (Operation Avalanche); Invasion of France (Operation Overlord); the airborne invasion of the Netherlands (Operation Market-Garden); and the airborne crossing of the Rhine River, (Operation Varsity). History : For additional history and lineage, see 61st Air Base Wing The group was established before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, in December 1940, with Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft. It initially trained under I Troop Carrier Command in the southeast United States. Trained in paratroop missions and glider towing. Was deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) and flew combat missions in the North African and Tunisian Campaigns under Twelfth Air Force. It flew airborne assault and resupply airdrop missions during the invasions of Sicily and Italy in 1943 and transported cargo and personnel throughout the North African and Mediterranean theaters. Reassigned to Ninth Air Force and was moved to England in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). Flew airborne assault missions during the Normandy invasion and later supported Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. In 1945 it participated in the airborne assault across the Rhine. Also provided transport services in the European theater, hauling gasoline, ammunition, food, medicine, and other supplies, and evacuating wounded personnel. Moved to Trinidad in May 1945. Assigned to Air Transport Command. Used C-47's to transport troops returning to the US. Inactivated in Trinidad on 31 July 1945 Cold War It was reactivated in Germany on 30 September 1946. Assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe. Redesignated 61st Troop Carrier Group (Medium) in July 1948, and 61st Troop Carrier Group (Heavy) in August 1948. In Germany, the group participated in the Berlin Airlift, from June 1948 to May 1949, the group's C-54 aircraft ferried coal, flour, and other cargo into Berlin. In 1950, the group moved to the United States shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War for duty with Military Air Transport Service. Attached to Far East Air Forces, it flew airlift missions on the Northern Pacific Route from the United States to Japan in support of UN forces in Korea before moving to Japan and conducting airlift missions from Japan to Korea from 1950‚Äì1952. Returned to the US in November 1952 to join Tactical Air Command, to which the group had been assigned in October 1951. Converted from C-54 to C-124 aircraft and carried out worldwide strategic airlift operations from 1952‚Äì1959. Inactivated on 8 October 1959. The 61st Military Airlift Group was reactivated at Howard Air Force Base, Panama on 1 December 1984. At Howard, the group was the parent unit for the 310th Military Airlift Squadron (310th MAS) with a diverse array of aircraft (C-21A, CT-43A, C-130E/H, C-27A). The C-21 and CT-43 provided VIP airlift support for the Commander-In-Chief, U.S. Southern Command (CINCSOUTH). The C-130s and C-27s flew tactical airlift operations in Central and South America from 1984‚Äì1992. The unit was inactivated and its assets absorbed by the 24th Wing when the 310th's mission was transferred to Air Combat Command on 1 June 1992.

It is found to be linked to the X chromosome and caused by a mutation in the HDAC8 gene, which is located on the q arm at locus 13.1. Individuals with Wilson‚ÄìTurner syndrome have a spectrum of physical characteristics including dysmorphic facial features, hypogonadism, and short stature. Females generally have milder phenotypes than males. This disorder affects all demographics equally and is seen in less than one in one million people. History The study of X-linked mental retardation began in 1943 when Martin and Bell reported a family exhibiting sex-linked mental retardation. However, this syndrome was not recognized until 1991. Wilson studied 14 males from three successive generations that presented hypogonadism, mental retardation, gynecomastia, and short stature, among other symptoms. Eventually, this disorder was ruled distinct from a syndrome presented by Prader and Willi (Prader-Willi syndrome) because of its mode of inheritance, gynecomastia, and the presence of small hands and feet. However, there is some speculation that this syndrome is in the same spectrum as the Cornelia de Lange syndrome.  Symptoms  The most notable features of Wilson-Turner syndrome are intellectual disability, obesity, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and distinct facial features. All of the symptoms are chronic. Affected females are known to have less severe signs and symptoms than males. Female carriers of the disorder may have mild or no symptoms. * Intellectual disability is the limitation in an individual's mental functioning and skills. Patients with Wilson-Turner syndrome have mental disabilities generally ranging from mild to severe, more frequently the former. This symptom often coincides with delays in speech development and the occurrence of mood swings. Most males were noted to have a quiet and a cheerful disposition. However, individuals who displayed aggression and became easily upset were also seen. Children display delays in speech development often combined with excessive drooling and low voice tones. Some of the studied male patients had speech impairments ranging from little or no speech to minor stuttering. * Obesity is the accumulation of excess fat on the body. Individuals with Wilson-Turner syndrome are characterized as having truncal obesity, meaning the fat has accumulated in the middle. Truncal obesity is often related to heart disease, kidney disease, and a lowered blood immune system. Truncal obesity in this disorder becomes more apparent around the age of puberty. * Tapered fingers, in which one end of the finger is diminished in thickness, causing the ends of the fingers to appear pointed. This deformity is not debilitating in any particular manner. In addition to tapered fingers, both hands and feet tend to be small. Some males were observed to have pes planus, also known as flat feet. * Hypogonadism is a condition in which the gonads have a decrease in function. This condition may result from the lack of sex hormone synthesis, such as androgen and estrogen. Hormones produced by the gonads may also decrease. Hypogonadism also influences the onset of other conditions of Wilson-Turner syndrome, such as gynecomastia and decreased testes size in males. It can also cause short stature in men and women. In addition to little genital development, pubic and body hair are scant. * Some of the facial features that are associated with Wilson-Turner syndrome include small head circumferences, high foreheads, prominent ears, and noses with flattened bridges. There have been cases of moderately high palates. Low muscle tone and subcutaneous swelling in facial tissue has also been noted. Thick eyebrows are also common. However, there have been reported cases where individuals had none of the mentioned facial features, which shows phenotypic abnormalities which have possible environmental influences. * Gynecomastia is a non- cancerous increase in male breast tissue. It is believed that disturbances in the endocrine system lead to an increase in estrogen and androgen hormones which cause the development of gynecomastia. A key feature of gynecomastia is rubbery or firm glandular subcutaneous chest tissue that is palpated under the areola of the nipple, instead of the soft fatty tissue. There can also be in increase in the diameter of the areola asymmetry in the chest tissue. The breast enlargement can occur in one or both side. Similar to truncal obesity, gynecomastia becomes apparent around the age of puberty. Causes  The only known cause of this disorder is the mutation on the HDAC8 gene, which is located at Xq13.1. This disorder displays X-linked inheritance.  Mechanism   Pathophysiology  The primary symptoms of Wilson-Turner Syndrome is believed to result from an improperly developed histone deacetylase 8. This enzyme is coded by the HDAC8 gene. The identified mutation in the HDAC8 gene leads to a version of histone deacetylase 8 that is missing a segment. Histone deacetylase 8 is believed to be a regulator of the cohesion complex, playing a role in stabilizing the cell‚Äôs genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and controlling gene activity. This abnormally shortened protein alters gene regulations during the individual‚Äôs normal development. Some of the effected normal development lies in the endocrine system. Males will have more estrogen and androgen than normal, leading to enlarged hypogonadism and gynecomastia. Other abnormal development is related to general mental capacity. HDACs are known to be associated with human brain development disorders. HDAC8, in particular, represses transcription factors in neural crest cells to control various patterns of the skull. This contributes to the various forms of facial deformities in individuals with Wilson-Turner Syndrome. Some of the facial deformities caused by the HDAC8 include prominent supraorbital ridges and high cheekbones. Researchers also contribute the error in the HDAC8 gene to obesity. Since the HDAC family proteins are involved in changes in the gene expression in the hypothalamus, it is also believed that the individual‚Äôs metabolism conditions are altered.  Diagnosis   Techniques  The diagnosis of Wilson‚ÄìTurner syndrome is based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic features. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the HDAC8 gene is now available to confirm the diagnosis.  Criteria  The Wilson‚ÄìTurner syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate range of intellectual disability, obesity, tapered fingers, and mood swings. Males also suffer from gynecomastia and hypogonadism. In order to be diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome, male patients must suffer from intellectual disability, obesity, and gynecomastia. Females do not necessarily have to have noticeable phenotype but can be diagnosed with this disorder by studying her family history and identifying others with the disorder. It has been noted that children with Wilson-Turner Syndrome will display speech development delay and excessive drooling. Males can be confirmed by testing androgen levels. Female carriers will show silencing of the gene a complex X inactivation.  Family and medical history  Family medical history is studied in depth due to its X-linked inheritance. The families that were studied and diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome have shown X-linked recessive pedigree pattern. This disorder only have been identified in two families, thus there is still ongoing studies concerning other inherited factors that may contribute to this disorder.  Screening  Screening methods are mostly done for females to determine if they are carriers. Males do not have to be tested because those with the disorder will show symptoms close to the time they are born because the disorder is inherited from the X chromosome. Females can be tested if they are carriers by performing a X chromosome inactivation analysis on DNA isolated from the peripheral lymphocytes. The CAG repeat in this section must be amplified and methylated DNA must be sorted from unmethylated DNA with PCR. Carrier females will show skewed X-inactivation pattern (skewing close to 100%) with the mutated allele inactivated. This indicates a selection against cells with an active X chromosome with the mutated HDAC8 gene.  Treatment and prognosis   Common treatment  There is no known cure available for Wilson-Turner syndrome. Instead, treatment options are available to fight individual symptoms. For obesity, a nutritional diet manipulation is combined with an exercise regimen that has a greater energy expenditure than intake. For hypogonadism, testosterone replacement is done. For gynecomastia, weight loss using similar methods for obesity is prescribed. However, if the individual finds their increased breast tissue psychologically distressing or too severe, reduction mammaplasty is done. Currently, researchers are investigating therapies using antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors to treat persistent pubertal gynecomastia.  Long-term complications  Unlike Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, a disorder that was determined to be very similar to WTS, the individuals with Wilson‚ÄìTurner syndrome do not develop cataracts or hypermetropia later in life. By far, the most debilitating part of this disorder is intellectual disability. Many of the other symptoms are more easily managed through hormone treatment, proper diet and exercise, and speech therapy. Epidemiology This disorder affects all demographics equally. The two families that were studied are of European ancestry. Wilson‚ÄìTurner syndrome is considered to be a rare disease because it affects one individual out of one million.  Recent research  In 2012, a study of a five-generation Dutch family consisting of seven males and seven females with Wilson-Turner syndrome. These individuals had some characteristics that differed from the stated phenotype mentioned by Wilson. These individuals have a larger stature, head, and chin, in addition to coarse facial features. Unlike the females in Wilson's study, these females showed signs of being affected, although less severe than their male counterparts. None of the men could live on their own. Studies verified that the phenotype of the disorder range on a large scale and can affect everyone differently. This research group also used next-generation sequencing of the X chromosome exome to identify the HDAC8 gene mutation There is also ongoing research to determine the cause of the decreased or low androgen levels. It is studying the possible disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis because of the low levels of androgen are combined with normal levels of FSH and LH.

Dobele was built in 1335 by the Livonian order on top of a more ancient castle.  History  Place of the Dobele medieval castle was inhabited by Semigallians before and during Livonian crusade. On the hillfort was located administrative centre of the Dobele county and quite big settlement around it. It is first time mentioned in the written sources in 1254. During Livonian crusade heavy battles took place around the hillfort. It endured six sieges by Livonian order but crusaders never managed to conquer it. In 1279 crusader army from Kuldƒ´ga together with allied curonians attacked semigallian Dobele castle but was unable to conquer it. In winter 1280/81 Livonian order attacked Dobele castle under command of master Konrad von Feuchtwangen but attack failed. In winter 1288/89 large crusader army including allied estonians and latgalians under command of master Kuno von Hazzingenstein attacked Dobele. However they were able only to pillage and burn Dobele town but castle endured the siege. In 1289 after famine and crusader scorched earth policy to the whole region semigallians burned their Dobele castle and migrated to Lithuania. Thus Dobele castle was one of the last semigallian fortresses in the territory of Latvia. Livonian order built stone castle on the abandoned semigallian hillfort in the years 1335‚Äì1347. Small craftsmen and merchant settlement soon developed around castle. Until 1562 castle was a seat of the Dobele komtur. In the 16th and 17th centuries several regional assemblies (landtag) were held in the castle. In 1621 and 1625 castle was occupied by Swedish troops under king Gustav II Adolf. From 1643 until 1649 castle was a residence of the widow of the Duke of Courland Elisabeth Magdalena who lived there together with her foster son, future duke Jacob. During Polish-Swedish wars castle was occupied by swedes in 1658. After the war it was partly restored by duke Jacob Kettler. During Great Northern War castle was again occupied by swedes in 1701. King of Sweden Charles XII stayed in the castle for the six days. During war castle was heavily devastated and was not restored.

Family Lockwood was from a successful Doncaster family. His grandfather, Joseph Lockwood (c1758-1837) was twice mayor of Doncaster and part-owner of the limestone quarries at Levitt Hagg, as was his father, also Joseph (1785-1842), who was also a stonemason and builder. He was the uncle of Sir Frank Lockwood QC (1846‚Äì1897), and the great grandfather of the film actress Margaret Lockwood (1916‚Äì1990). Another nephew was Louis Lockwood (1864-1907) who was a successful architect in St. Paul, Minnesota. A more distant cousin was Sir Joseph Flawith Lockwood (1904‚Äì1991) the Chairman of EMI. Lockwood married his first cousin Emma Dey (1810‚Äì1882). Charles Day (boot blacking manufacturer), who made a colossal fortune through the Day and Martin company, was uncle to both of them (their mothers were Day's sisters), and they received various inheritances originating from his wealth. Their ten children were all named 'Day' as a middle name: Emma (1833), Charles (1834), Henry (1836), Arthur (1838), Rosa (1840), Horace (1842), Frederick (1845), Florence (1849), Francis (1851), and Blanche (1853). Henry Lockwood and his family lived for many years at Nun Wood, Apperley Bridge, Yeadon, but after 1871 moved to Heron Court, Richmond, Surrey, where he died aged 66 on Sunday, 21 July 1878. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery (a few metres behind Blondin of Niagara Falls fame). Emma Lockwood died aged 72 on Christmas Day 1882The Times, 3 January 1883. Life and work Training Henry Francis Lockwood was articled in London to Peter Frederick Robinson, and given supervision of the extensions to York Castle for which Robinson had been appointed architect in 1826. In 1834 Lockwood published jointly with Adolphus H Cates, The History and Antiquities of the Fortifications to the City of York.Lockwood, Henry F. and Cates, Adolphus H. (1834), The History and Antiquities of the Fortifications to the City of York, J. Weale Architectural Library, London.

The architect Cuthbert Brodrick served his articles with Lockwood in Hull, but later declined an offer of a partnership. Partnership with Thomas Allom In 1834 Lockwood set up a practice in Hull, where in partnership with Thomas Allom he designed a number of Neo-classical buildings, such as Hull Trinity House (1839), extensions to Hull Royal Infirmary (1840) and Great Thornton Street Church (1843); the pair also designed the expansion of the Brownlow Hill workhouse in Liverpool (1842-1843). The partnership with Allom ended by mutual consent on 30 December 1843.The London Gazette, 2 January 1844 Partnership with William Mawson In 1849 Lockwood formed a partnership with William Mawson, and the following year they moved to Bradford where they were later joined by Mawson's brother, Richard. Lockwood and Mawson designed some of the most distinguished buildings in Bradford, including St George's Hall (1851-2), the Venetian Gothic Wool Exchange (1864-7), and the Continental Gothic Revival City Hall (1869‚Äì73). They also laid out and designed the mill, model town and church at Saltaire (1851‚Äì76), all in an Italianate Classical style. At the time, Saltaire was one of the most important examples of a philanthropic industrial and housing development in the world. Lockwood is mentioned in most accounts of Sir Titus Salt and Saltaire. Drummond Mill in Manningham was likewise designed by Lockwood and Mawson. They also submitted designs in many competitions, including the contest for the Law Courts in the Strand, London (1866‚Äì67).Port, M.H., The New Law Courts Competition, 1866-67. Architectural History, Vol. 11, (1968), pp. 75-120, which includes reproductions of all the entries. Lockwood's drawing was thought \\"monotonous\\" and did not win. After 1871, Lockwood moved to London where he designed the Methodist City Temple at Holborn Viaduct (originally 1874 but rebuilt after World War II), the Church of St Stephen, Cowbridge Park, East Twickenham (1874) and the Civil Service Stores, Strand (1876). Lockwood and Mawson were also appointed architects for the new buildings at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby (1874). H F Lockwood was the first President of the Bradford Society of Architects and Surveyors (BSAS) when it was founded in 1874. Burgess (1998) provides a thorough account of Lockwood's career, with a full catalogue of his architecture and an evaluation of its importance.Burgess, Jon (1988).

Life and times Quirno Costa was born in Buenos Aires to Fernanda Costa and Gregorio Quirno. He received a juris doctor at the University of Buenos Aires, and married Alcira Albarrac√≠n Pacheco, with whom he had four children. He entered public service as an official in the Argentine legation in Brazil in 1868, and was appointed the following year as Undersecretary of Foreign Relations. Taking office toward the end of the Paraguayan War, in which Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay were in a protracted war with Paraguay, Quirno Costa represented Argentina at the 1870 treaty ending hostilities, and obtained the concession of what is today Formosa Province (coveted for its Quebracho forests). He formed part of a commission on the reform of the Buenos Aires Province Constitution in 1871, and was elected to Congress in 1878 for the newly formed National Autonomist Party. The election of that party's nominee, Miguel Ju√°rez Celman, to the presidency in 1886 resulted in his appointment as Foreign Minister, during which he pursued regional international law agreements and negotiated a treaty with Chile to help settle the Puna de Atacama dispute, in which Argentine claims over Tarija, Bolivia were dropped for a greater share of the Puna de Atacama region (prized for its copper deposits). Quirno Costa was appointed Ambassador to Chile in 1892, by which he sought, unsuccessfully, to resolve the Beagle Channel dispute between the two neighboring countries. The longtime leader of the National Autonomists, Julio A. Roca, ran again for the presidency in 1897 (he had been once elected, in 1880) and chose Quirno Costa as his running mate. He presided over the January 1898 constitutional amendment convention, and was elected with Roca that April, serving uneventfully as Vice President for the entirety of Roca's second, six-year term. He visited Europe during late 1902. Quirno Costa returned briefly to government as Interior Minister (Home Secretary) to President Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta in 1906, but retired shortly afterward.

Contribution to the development of law in India Soon after demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992, President's Rule was imposed in the four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states, viz., Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. When these proclamations were challenged in the Supreme Court by lawyers such as Soli Sorabjee, Ram Jethmalani, Shanti Bhushan and others who generally represented the opposition parties, Rao defended the Proclamations representing the States of Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh which were then under President's Rule. Rao conceived, developed and presented the argument based on secularism which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and convinced the Court that all the four BJP Governments had acted in concert and violated the basic feature of secularism by mobilising, encouraging and supporting the Kar Sevaks who demolished Babri Masjid. The Supreme Court upheld all the four Proclamations. The judgement is reported as SR Bommai v Union of India, (1994) 3 SCC 1 = AIR 1994 SC 1918. Rao appeared in several other leading cases involving interpretation of the Constitution. He successfully fought against capitation fees in educational institutions in J.P. Unnikrishnan's case (1993); for the privileges of members of parliament in P.V. Narasimha Rao's case (1998) ; for the Governor's power to appoint a Chief Minister who is not a member of the Legislature, but enjoying majority support while her appeal against conviction was pending in B.R. Kapoor's case (2001); for the voters' right to information about the antecedents of contesting candidates in the PUCL case appearing for Lok Satta (2003); for Government's power of regulation of admissions to professional courses for preventing exploitation of students by private institutions in T.M.A. Pai (2002), Islamic Academy (2003) and P.A. Inamdar (2005). Representing the National Human Rights Commission, he persuaded the Supreme Court to intervene directly in the Best Bakery case in which Fast Track Court had acquitted all the accused. He successfully defended the constitutional validity of Entry Tax before a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in 2016. He had led the arguments on behalf of States of MP and Andhra Pradesh.

The show had its Off-Broadway premiere production in 2019, presented by the Prospect Theater Company at 59E59 Theaters, with first preview performance on November 5 and the closing performance on December 14. The Off-Broadway production of Einstein's Dreams was nominated for four Drama Desk Awards, including Outstanding Music (Rosenblum), Outstanding Lyrics (Lessner and Rosenblum), Outstanding Lighting Design (Herrick Goldman), and Outstanding Projections (David Bengali). Rosenblum wrote the songs and incidental music for Quincy Long's play The Joy of Going Somewhere Definite, which ran Off- Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in 1997. In 2005, in response to the re-election of President George W. Bush, Rosenblum created the satirical musical revue Bush is Bad, which ran for a year and a half at New York‚Äôs Triad Theater, and spawned additional productions in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Charleston, SC. In its original iteration, it starred Kate Baldwin, Michael McCoy, and Neal Mayer, who each portrayed multiple figures in the Bush administration. Also along political lines, Rosenblum wrote book, music, and lyrics for Mark Felt, Superstar, which tells the story of the Watergate scandal from the perspective of \\"Deep Throat,\\" the FBI official who was the secret source for journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. Mark Felt, Superstar had performances at the Triad in April 2015, and a limited run at the York Theatre in 2017. In February 2016, the Central School of Speech and Drama in London presented a devised musical theater work consisting of Rosenblum's songs, entitled \\"Love is Not a Science\\". As a result, the Central School commissioned Rosenblum and Lessner to write a new musical, based on the play Stage Door by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman, which received its world premiere production in May, 2017.  Concert music  Rosenblum has composed extensively for the concert hall, and his works can be heard on two recordings, Impetuosities and Sundry Notes, both on the Albany Records label. In 2009, Rosenblum founded The Pit Stop Players, a chamber group composed of New York freelance musicians. The group focuses on contemporary classical music, including Rosenblum‚Äôs own compositions, but also plays pieces from a wide variety of other genres, including rock, jazz, fusion, opera, and film music. The group's concerts have been critically acclaimed. A 2012 performance featured Rosenblum's original work, \\"A Young Person's Guide to the Pit Stop Players.\\" The piece, an homage to Britten's similarly titled \\"A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,\\" was narrated by actress/director Cynthia Nixon.  Music journalism  Rosenblum has contributed CD and performance reviews as well as feature articles to Opera News magazine on a regular basis since 1999. He has also written for Newsday, Stagebill, ZEALnyc, and The Charleston Post and Courier (as Overview Critic for the Spoleto Festival USA).

Only 10% of all property transactions in the United Kingdom are chain-free.  Origins of the term  The term 'property chain' is common in real estate, especially in the UK. The chain is the line of people buying and selling. For example, there might be a first time buyer trying to purchase a small flat, another person waiting to move from the flat to a small house, another person waiting to move from the small house to a larger house and so on. If one person drops out of the chain, the sellers are not able to continue with their moves and the chain collapses.  Reasons for chain-free properties  Chain-free properties are available for numerous reasons: * Homeowner reasons - the current homeowner has already a new home to move to, the seller is not buying a new home, emigration, selling on behalf of a deceased relative * Financial institutions (lenders, banks and building societies) ‚Äì after acquiring properties thorough repossession, probate or equity release, they are re-sold on the open market. As the seller is a company, not a private individual, there is no property chain. * Home builders ‚Äì properties that have been acquired in a part-exchange transaction and are being re-sold on the open market. As above, the vendor is a company, not a private individual so there is no property chain. * Professional Investors ‚Äì properties that have been acquired as part of a portfolio, not for the owner to reside but as investments. Although a private individual, the vendor is selling for business reasons, not to enable them to move on, making the property sale chain-free.  Recent rise in volumes and popularity among home buyers  The sale of chain-free properties has risen in the past two years, mainly due to the rising number of properties being repossessed in light of the credit crunch. After repossessing properties, lenders look to sell the properties on so they can unlock the cash tied up in them and use it to rebuild their damaged mortgage books. With house prices falling in the past two years, these properties are usually priced to sell quickly to limit any losses on the properties. Therefore, there are obvious benefits in purchasing a chain-free property: * They are priced to sell in a short timeframe, making them usually slightly below the general market value. * Unlike a traditional purchase, where the ability of a ‚Äòchain‚Äô of buyers and sellers to move affects a purchase, there are only two parties involved in the purchase of a chain-free property ‚Äì the buyer and the seller ‚Äì making it a much simpler transaction.

Professor Caycedo also founded Sofrocay, the International Caycedian Sophrology Academy based in Andorra, where his Caycedian methods are practiced. Biography Following his early education in Colombia, Caycedo moved to Spain to study in the faculty of medicine at the University of Madrid where he became a doctor of medicine and surgery. He specialised in psychiatry and neurology under the direction of Juan Josƒó L√≥pez-Ibor (1906-1991), professor of psychiatry at the University of Madrid. While in Spain, Caycedo began to develop his own psychiatric method. He was interested in the medical use of hypnosis, but weary of the public reception of that term. To distance himself and his method from contemporary mystics, he coined the term Sophrology in October, 1960 to describe his technique. The same year he founded the first department of clinical sophrology at Madrid University. In practice, Sophrologists came to utilize a combination of hypnosis and humanistic psychology. In 1963, Caycedo met Ludwig Binswanger, the Swiss founder of phenomenological psychiatry. Caycedo became familiar with the method of investigation of consciousness proposed by Husserl and Heidegger which influenced the direction of his own research in that field. Expounding upon this influence, Caycedo attempted to make existential phenomenology accessible and practical through Sophrology. The direction of his research turned to modified states of consciousness with a phenomenology-inspired approach. Caycedo later spent time in India where he learned Yoga from Yogis whom he met through Indian doctors. In the Himalayas, he met one of the doctors of the 14th Dalai-Lama, who introduced Caycedo to methods such as Tummo, a Tibetan breathing exercise which is meant to help the user reach modified states of consciousness. Caycedo also visited Japan where he studied Zazen. Caycedo recognised emphasis on the body as the unifying principle in these different methods, which he carried over to Sophrology. In Barcelona from 1968 to 1982, Caycedo gained his Professorship at the School of Psychiatry at the University of Barcelona in the faculty of medicine. During this period, Caycedo did extensive experimentation and research on his theories of Dynamic Relaxation (exercise in slow movement). * 1970 First World Congress of Sophrology was held in Barcelona with 1400 specialists and 42 countries represented. The future king of Spain, Juan Carlos was the president of honour along with the future queen, Sofia. * 1973 European Symposium in Lausanne, Brussels where the first collective sophrology training took place in Paris. * 1975 The Second World Congress of Sophrology was held in Barcelona. * 1977 The First Pan-American Symposium of Sophrology was held in Recife (Brazil). From 1982 to 1988, Caycedo developed Sophrology in Bogot√°. It was presented in 1985 at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in the Charcot amphitheatre. From 1988 to his death, Professor Caycedo continued to develop his Sophrology method in Andorra. In 1989, he created the new level of Master of Caycedian Sophrology and founded the International University of Caycedian Sophrology (Sophrocay International). Sophrology is well-established in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and South America. In 2005 a Sophrology centre was set up in Geneva and London to bring sophrology to the English- speaking world.  Bibliography  * La sofrolog√≠a m√©dica. Su aplicaci√≥n a la odontolog√≠a, 1961, Rev.

It is set in the upper- class society of Delhi, India and is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma with the same tone as the 1995 cult Hollywood film Clueless which is also an adaptation of Austen's novel. The choreography of this film was done by Neerav Bavlecha. The film released on 6 August 2010 to mixed-to-positive critical reviews, eventually becoming a semi-hit at the box office. Plot Aisha Kapoor (Sonam Kapoor) is a young, rich, upper-class girl who believes that she is perfectly suited for match-making ‚Äì amongst her friends in particular. Her superficial lifestyle and match-making schemes are constantly criticized by her friend/neighbor Arjun Burman (Abhay Deol), who advises her to stop meddling with the lives of other people. Soon, she has a new project - trying to make a match between her middle-class, small-town friend Shefali Thakur (Amrita Puri) and a sweetmeat business tycoon and friend, Randhir Gambhir (Cyrus Sahukar), much to the chagrin of her best friend Pinky Bose (Ira Dubey). Aisha creates various circumstances to make Shefali and Randhir fall in love. During one such occasion, she meets her aunt's step-son Dhruv Singh (Arunoday Singh), whom she becomes attracted to. In the meantime, Arjun introduces Aisha to one of his colleagues, Aarti Menon (Lisa Haydon), who is from New York. Aisha feels threatened by Aarti's presence and is very antagonistic towards her. Randhir organizes a river-rafting camp for everyone, and Aisha uses this as a chance to get Randhir and Shefali to spend more time together. Meanwhile, Shefali gets proposed to by her childhood friend, Saurabh Lamba (Anand Tiwari) and she asks Aisha for advice, but Aisha passive- aggressively tells her to reject Saurabh and get with Randhir instead. However, one night during the camp, Randhir takes Aisha for a walk and then confesses his love for her. Confused and taken aback by Randhir's feelings for her, Aisha starts to doubt her match-making skills. Arjun comes to know of this and Aisha's dismissal of Saurabh of Shefali's behest, and gets angry at Aisha, criticizing her for once again meddling with the lives of others, and playing with Shefali's feelings. Aisha tries to console a heartbroken Shefali. As time passes, Pinky starts to develop feelings for Randhir and eventually they are engaged. This causes a problem between Pinky and Aisha, and they stop speaking to each other. Disheartened with her previous failed match-making attempt, Aisha tries to match up Shefali with Dhruv. Shefali comes to know of Aisha's plan and confronts her, telling Aisha that she never viewed her as a friend, rather as a project, someone who she tried to mold and fix. Shefali then declares that she has feelings for Arjun. This greatly confuses and hurts Aisha, since she realises that she has been in love with Arjun all this time. Aisha realises that she has been selfish and arrogant all along, playing with the emotions and feelings of her friends. She goes back to her best friend, Pinky, and apologizes for her actions. Dhruv and Aarti get engaged, but Aisha chooses not to attend since she thinks that Arjun will be there with Shefali. After a late-night conversation with her father, Aisha decides spontaneously to go to the engagement and declare her feelings to Arjun. She meets Shefali, who tells her that love cannot be forced or planned, and also reveals that she has found her love in Saurabh, whose proposal she had previously turned down. Later that night, Arjun and Aisha meet and reminisce about their childhood and friendship, and ultimately declare their love for each other. The movie ends one year later, at Dhruv and Aarti's wedding, where Aisha states that love is spontaneous and never goes according to plan.

Track list Music Review Aisha's soundtrack by Amit Trivedi received extraordinary appreciation from every corner. IBNLive said, \\"With the stupendous music of Dev.D, Amit Trivedi proved his prowess and now with the soundtrack of forthcoming film Aisha, he has reaffirmed that he is a young composer to look out for. Amit Trivedi deserves to be applauded for the soundtrack of Aisha, which is contemporary yet different. The composer has tried to fuse new sounds in the music of the film, which has worked very well. \\" Atta Khan of Planet Bollywood said,\\"Put simply, the music of Aisha is super cool, vibrant and fun, has tons of variety and is an extremely colourful and inventive soundtrack that defines the new-age music we have come to associate with Amit Trivedi.\\" According to Glamsham, \\"AISHA is a sassy, stylish, cool album and has that desired \\"feel-good\\" musical feel to strike chords with pop-genre listeners. Amit Trivedi proves his mettle again and is high on his creative genius with strong inputs and influences of classical rock and youthful peppy-feel tracks. Chartbusting success and oodles of entertainment are there in soundtracks like \\"Suno Aisha\\", \\"Sham\\", \\"Lehrein\\" and \\"By The Way\\" and makes it sure that it will be positive add-ons to the narration of the flick.\\" Raja Sen of Rediff said,\\"What really does stand out in Trivedi's work is a defiant lack of attention to lyric. The best composers in the industry have either Oscar-winning poets writing their words or quirky ad-men crafting makeshift metaphors or even young bespectacled directors knowing what their songs should say: Trivedi seems to have none of this in Aisha, and yet gives us a very enjoyable, very young soundtrack with a distinct voice. His music ‚Äì in fact, the feel of his music ‚Äì does its own talking, and I recommend you listen to it a while.\\" Usha Lakra of Apun Ka Choice said,\\"Seeing Amit‚Äôs history of producing unconventional Bollywood tracks, the Aisha compositions have us completely floored. The composer has got fire in the belly and he has proved his mettle yet again. Oh boy! Where were you?\\" Harshita Kohli of Planet Radio City said this about the music,\\"Overall, Aisha is a young album. The music is catchy, peppy and makes you feel good by the time you hit stop. It is far removed from Amit‚Äôs previous work and that shows the talent this young man has. Definitely an album worth having!\\" Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama said,\\"Aisha springs a pleasant surprise. Of course one did expect a good score here but what one gets to hear is complete album that is new-age, different and yet so appealing to youth. There is not a single song which doesn't work and each one tries to better the other. Ever since the release of music of Dev.D, one wondered if composer Amit Trivedi would ever manage to come up with a wholesome album like that. He did compose for a few films in between and some of his work did impress. However, Aisha will clearly stand out as his best score since Dev.D. Go for it and play it on with friends! \\" Vipin of Music Aloud said, \\"Just a week since Udaan hit the shelves, Amit Trivedi continues to amaze with his consistency as he churns out another unputdownable soundtrack for Aisha. Respect!\\" Mukund Laddha of Music Perk said,\\"Amit Trivedi adds another feather in his hat with this album. The music album of Aisha has a jazzy song in its title track which is surely one of best songs of 2010 along with \\"Gal Mitthi Mitthi\\". None of the other songs create any interest though. The background music of this movie is praiseworthy. It is surely one album that you can to check out.\\" Reception Critical Reception Aisha received mixed-to-positive critical response. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India awarded the movie 4/5, saying that \\"Sweet love, substantial performances, super fun, slick 'n stylish, Aisha is a-ha stuff.\\" Indo-Asian News Service of NDTV gave the movie a positive review, stating that \\"Engaging and endearing ‚Äì Aisha makes you wonder if there's anything more important in the world than finding the right match.\\" Sonia Chopra of Sify awarded the movie 3.5/5, commenting that \\"It‚Äôs so rare for a film to get it all together: from the story, to the performances, to the atmospherics, to the music and more. This one goes perfectly with the popcorn; don‚Äôt miss it.\\" Taran Adarsh of One India awarded the movie 3.5/5, concluding that \\"Aisha holds appeal for the youth mainly and there's a strong likelihood that this segment of movie-going audience will fall for its charms.\\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today awarded the movie 3/5, commenting that \\"It's trashy, but it's beautifully trashy. Almost like the food and conversation at a long Delhi brunch.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff awarded the movie 3/5, saying that \\"Beautifully shot and packaged with a fabulous soundtrack and superlative ensemble cast, Aisha, quite often, gets caught up in a self-created tangle of brand-led vanity to ever let one get acquainted to its leading lady.\\" Aniruddha Guha of DNA India awarded the movie 2.5/5, stating that \\"Aisha leaves you with mixed feelings. It, however, might be the ideal date-flick.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express awarded the movie 2/5, concluding that \\"This is a good-looking movie, with not a hair out of place, but we wish it was a little more rumpled, a little more lived in. Aisha is strictly in- between shallow.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN awarded the movie 2/5, saying that \\"Aisha is like a pretty flute of champagne, but it loses its fizz far too quickly.\\" Komal Nahta of DNA India awarded the movie 2/5, stating that \\"Aisha was never meant for the single-screen and small-town audiences, but it doesn't cut ice with the multiplex and city audience either.\\" Box-Office India Aisha had an average opening at the box office, with collections of around 30‚Äì35%. and collected net in its first day. It collected in its first weekend. It went on to collect net in its first week and in its second week. It grossed in its lifetime run.

Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Cyr came to prominence in her late teens on Montreal cable television assisting and presenting on shows such as Musi-Video (a forerunner to Canada's MuchMusic). She fitted in her TV presenting and pop career with studying Communications at Montreal's Concordia University. While working at Musi-Video, she was asked to provide female backing vocals for the synthpop band Nudimension who were appearing on the show. Originally selected to appear with Nudimension mainly for her good looks, it would soon become apparent to band founders Louis Rondeau and Marc Fontaine that Cyr was also a very competent, bilingual vocalist, and she was retained to work on the band's two albums (one in French and the other in English). She would go on to become the band's most prominent female vocalist; although she was never considered a permanent member of the band, Cyr is synonymous with Nudimension.YouTube: \\"Where Are They Now? - \\"Nudimension\\" In early 1983, Nudimension released the francophone single \\"Amour Programm√©\\" which was a synthpop duet between band founder Louis Rondeau (former drummer for the 222s) and Cyr. Released on the Saisons label principally in Quebec, it became a minor hit in the francophone regions of Canada; and by export in France and remaining North America. Cyr and Rondeau appeared together on the Canadian network TV show Lautrec '83 (presented by Donald Lautrec) to promote the single, her highest-profile TV performance. She also appeared on CFCF-TV on Friday night's Nite Life presented by Peter King, representing Nudimension. Four other singles followed, including \\"Big Boy\\" and \\"Hors la loi (Anne Marie version)\\" which both featured Cyr on lead vocals and acted as a clear demonstration of her vocal range in both languages. But without the commercial success that \\"Amour Programm√©\\" achieved, and the fact that manager Ben Kaye preferred to devote more time to his other 1983 signing, the then little known Celine Dion, Nudimension floundered; and beyond 1986 Cyr did not work with the band further. Nudimension itself would eventually stop recording around 1990. Cyr continues to live in Montreal, but no longer works in the media. The majority of Cyr's work with Nudimension is featured on their 2009 greatest hits album The Best of Nudimension. Discography Cyr only ever recorded with Nudimension and is listed as a \\"special guest\\" on record sleeves.

Lakoba was Sergei Bagapsh's Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2004 Presidential election and from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2011 to 2013 he served as Secretary of the Security Council. He is Professor in Archeology, Ethnology and History at the Abkhazian State University. Early life and career Stanislav Lakoba was born on 23 February 1953 in Sukhumi. He is partially Afro-Abkhazian through a paternal great-grandfather from Pichori. He graduated from the History faculty of the Sukhumi State Pedagogical Institute. Lakoba was the author of the 1989 Lykhny declaration. During the 1992-1993 war with Georgia Lakoba was a member of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet. From 1993 to 1994 he served as First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council and from 1994 to 1996 as the First Deputy Speaker of the Supreme Soviet. During the October 1999 Presidential election Stanislav Lakoba published the controversial –í—ã–±–æ—Ä—ã –ø–æ –•–∏—á–∫–æ–∫—É - Hitchcock's election - an article in which he criticised the fact that in the election incumbent president Vladislav Ardzinba ran unopposed. From 2000 onwards Lakoba became first Acting Professor and then Professor in Archeology, Ethnology and History at the Abkhazian State University. From 2000 to 2004 he was a Visiting Professor at the Hokkaido University Center for Slavic Studies. Vice Presidential candidature in the 2004 Presidential election Stanislav Lakoba is a member of the socio-political movement Amtsakhara. In the run-up to the 3 October 2004 Presidential election, Amtsakhara decided to enter into an alliance with fellow opposition party United Abkhazia. On 20 June, the two movements announced that they would nominate United Abkhazia's Sergei Bagapsh for the post of President and Lakoba for the post of Vice President. Bagapsh and Lakoba narrowly won in the first round with just 50.08% of the votes, but this was hotly contested by supporters of Raul Khajimba. The resulting stand-off lasted until on 5 December Bagapsh and Khajimba struck a deal in which the pair would run on a combined ticket in a new election. Secretary of the Security Council The deal between Bagapsh and Khajimba meant that Lakoba would no longer become Vice President. Instead, after the new election on 12 January 2005, Lakoba was appointed Secretary of the Security Council on 17 February. When Khajimba resigned as Vice President on 28 May 2009 he declared that within the government he had received most support by Lakoba. On 18 August Lakoba himself handed his resignation over the Abkhazian citizenship crisis, which was ratified on 25 August by President Bagapsh. On 17 September Lakoba's deputy in the Security Council Aleksandr Voinskiy was appointed to temporarily succeed him. In an interview with Caucasian Knot on 3 September Lakoba stated that he would not participate in the December 2009 presidential election and he called absurd the notion that he would join the opposition. Nevertheless, in an interview with the newspaper Nuzhnaya on 17 November, Lakoba stated that as a private citizen he supported Khajimba's candidacy and he praised his work in the Security Council. After the death of Sergei Bagapsh in 2011, Stanislav Lakoba was once again appointed Security Council Secretary on 7 December by his successor Alexander Ankvab, previously Vice President. However, on 28 October 2013, President Ankvab dismissed Stanislav Lakoba, over the same issue that had also prompted his resignation in 2009, the issuing of passports to Georgian residents of Abkhazia.

Created by Atsuko Nishida, Charizard first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue (Pok√©mon Red and Green in Japan) and subsequent sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It is known as the Flame Pok√©mon. Shin-ichiro Miki, the actor who voices James in the original Japanese version of the Pok√©mon anime, voices Charizard in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the anime. An orange, draconic Pok√©mon, Charizard is the evolved form of Charmeleon and the final evolution of Charmander. It also has two Mega Evolved forms, Mega Charizard X and Y, that were likely both designed by Tomohiro Kitakaze, the designer of Mega Charizard X, are not permanent and always revert to the normal Charizard form. It also has a single Gigantamax form, which changes both its appearance and size for 3 turns, until it is knocked out, until it is returned, or until the battle ends. Charizard is featured in the Pok√©mon anime series with the most recurring being from the main character Ash Ketchum. It is featured in printed adaptations such as Pok√©mon Adventures, in the possession of Blue, one of the main characters. Charizard appears in Pok√©mon Origins with main character Red as its trainer. In this series, Charizard is iconic, because it was the first Pok√©mon to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X and it helped beat Mewtwo. Charizard has received positive reception from the media, with GamesRadar describing it as \\"hands-down one of the coolest Pok√©mon out there\\". Charizard is the version mascot of Pok√©mon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts of Pok√©mon Stadium, Pok√©mon Ranger, Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, and Pok√©mon Super Mystery Dungeon. It has appeared in every entry of the Super Smash Bros. series, in an unplayable capacity in the first two games before becoming a playable character from Super Smash Bros. Brawl onwards. A Charizard also appears in the live-action animated film Detective Pikachu. In Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, Charizard has a Gigantamax form. Concept and characteristics  Conception  Charizard was designed by Atsuko Nishida, Charizard is one of the most rare Pok√©mon in the world, especially with Pok√©mon collectors. Its cost $200,000 for one Charizard first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized. Logan Paul did an unboxing video about Pok√©mon trading cards, and luckily he pulled one of the most rarest cards in the world , including the most expensive booster box in the world. Logan bought it for $200 thousand Yen, as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Charizard was designed before Charmander, the latter being actually based on the former. Originally called \\"Lizardon\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed \\"Charizard\\", a combination of the words \\"charcoal\\" or \\"char\\" and \\"lizard\\". During an interview, Pok√©mon Company President Tsunekazu Ishihara stated that Charizard was expected to be popular with North American audiences because of their preference for strong, powerful characters.  Physical information  Whereas its pre-evolutions Charmander and Charmeleon are ground-bound lizard like creatures, Charizard's design is inspired by dragons, more specifically European dragons. Even though Charizard gains the Flying secondary type instead of the Dragon type upon evolving, it belongs to the Dragon Egg Group, learns Dragon moves like Dragon Claw, and has its Flying type replaced by Dragon in its \\"Mega Charizard X\\" form. Charizard has two teal wings, with a mostly orange body and back. Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, that also features a more pronounced beak. In its \\"X\\" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its \\"Y\\" form, its appearance is influenced by that of Pteranodons, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads. Although categorized as a fire-flying type Pokemon by physique, by its nature or attack formations Charizard has a remarkable resemblance with an actual dragon, and with the dragon type moves skill set such as Dragon Rage, Draco Meter, Dragon Wing, Dragon Claw, Dragon Pulse etc. Charizard can be easily marked as a Fire-Flying-Dragon type Pokemon, a very rare tri variant combination, making it one of the most powerful Pokemon in the collection. The video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, flying proudly around the sky and constantly seeking for powerful opponents to quarrel with. They can breathe intense flames that can melt any material, but will never torch a weaker foe. If Charizard becomes angry, the flame at the tip of their tail can flare up in a whitish-blue color. Because of their reckless behavior, Charizard are known to unintentionally cause wildfires. While Mega Charizard X is known for its black body, hotter blue flames as well as its Dragon type, Mega Charizard Y is generally regarded for its flying prowess, with it allegedly being able to reach up to 10000 meters of altitude while flying. In the Pok√©mon anime episode \\"Charmander - The Stray Pok√©mon\\", where Ash befriends a Charmander that joins his team, it is learnt that Charmander and its evolutions must keep their tail fires burning to survive. Despite that, the Charizard's Burning Ambition episode showed Ash's Charizard surviving when going into water and the Pok√©mon Chronicles episode known as Those Darn Electabuzz! even showed a Charizard named Don being able to rescue people underwater and then going out of water at enough speed to keep flying. Eventually, the Pok√©mon Origins episode known as Charizard confirmed that the flame at the tip of Charizard's tail keeps burning in water, and Charizard is able to swim. Widely popular augmented reality mobile game, Pok√©mon Go, describes Charizard as a flame Pok√©mon. In Pok√©mon Go, Charizard exists in two forms, its original form with orange body and a cream-coloured patch on its belly, and its shiny form, which is a gray body with the same cream-coloured patch on its belly. Charizard's shiny form first made its appearance in Pok√©mon gold and silver, during Pok√©mon Go's Community Day event featuring Charmander. During the Community Day event, shiny Charmander may be encountered, which can be evolved into a shiny Charmeleon, and in turn evolved into a shiny Charizard.  Competitive battling  From its release in the first generation to the fifth generation, Charizard failed to make a major impact on the competitive scene, to the point where it \\"wasn't seen in serious competitive play\\" and was \\"doomed...to be forgotten.\\" This relative lack of viability, combined with its relentless popularity, gave it an unfavorable \\"reputation of a Pok√©mon that represents the fanboys.\\" In VGC (Video Game Championship) the official competitive format for pokemon is a doubles format that started in Generation 4, and Charizard didn't start to have much presence until it gained it's Mega Charizard Y form in 2014 and 2015 where it's ability drought set up sun which could support it's team members by activating abilities like solar power and chlorophyll and halving damage from water attacks whilst also boosting it's already powerful heat waves and allow it to fire off single turn solar beams, it could also help it's team even more with tailwind. However in 2016 it fell from usage as Primal Groupon outclassed it as a sun setter and fire type. In 2017 mega evolutions weren't allowed and in 2018 it again had lots of usage until Primal Groudon outclassed it again in 2019. In 2020 mega evolution isn't in the newest games Pok√©mon Sword and Sheild and so far it's been phenomenal with it's incredible gigantamax form with the move G-max wildfire which gives it a really strong damaging affect and even won Dallas Regionals. It got even better with it's hidden ability being allowed with it's gmax form making it do 50% more damage when sun is up which is easy with the amazing sun setter torkoal to make it do insane damage. Mega Charizard X hasn't been nearly as good in VGC over the years with it's ability being less useful and being weak to the common intimidate however it's still seen some success with people like Jamie Boyt winning a regional with it. In singles, it periodically found niches, as with the boosting move Belly Drum, but was crippled by the fourth generation's entry hazard Stealth Rock, which removed half of its health upon entering the battle while active. The sixth generation rescued Charizard's competitive status by introducing its Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y forms, transforming it into a \\"top-level threat\\" of Smogon's standard tier Appearances In video games Charizard made its video game debut in 1996 with the Japanese release of Pok√©mon Red and Blue. It is available only through Pok√©mon evolution from the starter Pok√©mon Charmander. In Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, and their remakes, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Charizard is used by Red, who acts as the games' final boss. Charizard is one of several Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon X and Y that is able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming either Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y. It was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pok√©mon X and Y. Charmander (along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Charizard's Mega Evolution. It is also able to have a new form Pok√©mon Sword and Shield called a Gigantamax form. Champion Leon has it as his main Pok√©mon in these games as well. Charizard has made appearances in many other Pok√©mon games. It appears in Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team on a team with an Alakazam and Tyranitar, who play a significant role in the story. In Pok√©mon Ranger, Charizard is a boss Pok√©mon who becomes attached to the player's character and assists him or her throughout the game. Charizard returns in Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs as another boss character. It is also one of the photographable Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Snap, as well as a non-playable character in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok√©Park 2: Wonders Beyond. Charizard has appeared many times throughout the Super Smash Bros. series. Charizard first appears as a non-playable character in Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, as one of the Pok√©mon which can appear if a player throws a Pok√© Ball. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Charizard is playable while under the command of the Pok√©mon Trainer. The Trainer has a Squirtle and an Ivysaur, all three of which can be switched between; unlike the other fighters, these Pok√©mon become fatigued and consequently weaker, and must be switched out long enough in order to recover. Charizard's moves include Rock Smash, Flamethrower, and Fly. Charizard is playable as a standalone character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where it gains the move Flare Blitz and its new Final Smash is transforming into Mega Charizard X. Charizard returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, where it is once again under the command of the Pok√©mon Trainer alongside Squirtle and Ivysaur.https://www.smashbros.com/en_AU/fighter/33-35.html Charizard also appears as a playable fighter in Pokk√©n Tournament. In anime In the anime, the most notable Charizard is one Ash Ketchum has had since he was a Charmander abandoned by his former owner Damian. Ash's Charmander evolved into Charmeleon after a battle against an army of Exeggutor, and his personality changed completely, becoming a disobedient and prideful Pok√©mon and fighting when and how he pleased. Charmeleon evolved when Ash summoned him for protection from wild prehistoric Pok√©mon; when an Aerodactyl attacked him and carried Ash off, Charmeleon evolved to fight the Aerodactyl and rescue Ash. Charizard still disobeyed Ash, preferring to sleep, and only battled Pok√©mon that would pose a challenge, but Charizard helped Ash reach his goals, particularly against Gym Leader Blaine. Charizard's disobedience to Ash cost him the Indigo League because Charizard chose to sleep instead of fighting. Charizard became loyal during the Orange Islands arc after Ash battled a trainer with a Poliwrath and Charizard was frozen solid. Because Ash helped Charizard thaw out, he began to obey Ash and defeated the Poliwrath in a rematch. He remained on Ash's team and contributed to his wins in the Orange League and parts of Johto. He eventually stayed behind in the Charizific Valley, a reserve where wild Charizard battle and train to become stronger. This was likely due to meeting Charla, a female Charizard for whom he developed a fondness. Charizard, like some of Ash's other Pok√©mon, returns on a temporary basis to battle at Ash's side, typically when Ash faces a particularly powerful Pok√©mon. Charizard has saved Ash's life on more than one occasion, as seen in the film Spell of the Unown, where he battled against Entei after arriving in the nick of time to prevent Ash and Pikachu from falling to their deaths, having flown over from the Charizific Valley after originally seeing a live broadcast of Ash running after Entei who had kidnapped Ash's mother, Delia Ketchum. Charizard returned during the Johto Pok√©mon League and defeated Gary's Blastoise, who had a type advantage over Charizard. Charizard also returned for Ash's first Battle Frontier battle, where he took on Articuno at the Battle Factory and won thanks to an unorthodox strategy. During the Best Wishes series, Charizard officially rejoined Ash's team, while Ash was exploring Unova. Upon meeting Ash again, he gave his trainer a Flamethrower to the face much to everyone's surprise. Charizard also developed a fierce rivalry with Iris's Dragonite so much so that both Ash and Iris agreed to have a battle. During the battle which originally began on the ground but later ascended skywards when both Pok√©mon took to the skies, it was shown that Charizard had learnt Wing Attack, Slash, and Dragon Tail but despite the two Pok√©mon having something of a very fierce rivalry with one another, N immediately called the battle off after realizing that Dragonite had injured its right arm. Charizard stayed with all of Ash's Pok√©mon sans Pikachu at Professor Oak's laboratory when Ash leaves Kanto once more for the faraway Kalos region. In the XY&Z; series, a Charizard appears under the ownership of Alain, who is one of Ash's rivals. Alain's Charizard can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X, and has shown to be powerful enough to defeat ten Mega Evolutions in a row. It later defeats Trevor's Charizard, who can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y, and even defeats Ash's Greninja in order to win the Lumiose Conference for Alain. In the Sun and Moon series, one of Ash's companions named Kiawe, who is a trial captain that specializes in Fire type Pok√©mon, has a Charizard. In Pokemon Journeys, Leon, who is the Champion of Galar, has a Charizard. This Charizard is capable of Gigantamaxing and defeats Lance's red Gyarados and defeats Ash's Pikachu, who can also Gigantamax. Charizard has its own DVD that contains three episodes featuring it: \\"Attack of the Prehistoric Pok√©mon\\", \\"Charizard Chills\\", and \\"Charizard's Burning Ambition\\". This DVD is part of the 10th Anniversary Box Set; in the Box Set's \\"10 Most Wanted Pok√©mon\\" countdown Charizard is listed as the third most wanted, beaten only by Pikachu and Jigglypuff. In the anime spin-off, Pok√©mon Origins, another Charizard appears under the ownership of Red, Ash's video game counterpart, where it started off as Red's starter Pok√©mon. After winning many battles, it eventually evolved into Charmeleon, and later Charizard. Red's Charizard helped its trainer defeat Team Rocket, win the Pok√©mon League, as well as help Red capture the elusive Pok√©mon, Mewtwo. During its battle against Mewtwo, Red's Charizard underwent Mega Evolution to become Mega Charizard X. In printed adaptations In Pok√©mon: Pikachu Shocks Back, which loosely parallels the storyline of the anime, Ash catches a Charmander, and it ultimately becomes a Charizard and battles in the Pok√©mon League tournament. Despite his catch, he has trouble controlling it.Ono, Toshihiro. Pok√©mon: Electric Pikachu Boogaloo Graphic Novel. VIZ Media LLC, April 5, 2000. Ash brings Charizard to the Orange Islands and trains it diligently since the near-disaster. He then uses it to battle Dragonite in the final showdown with the Orange Crew Supreme gym leader Drake. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. It evolves into a Charmeleon, and when Blue is possessed by a Gastly in the Lavender Tower, so is Charmeleon. Blue's Charmeleon is eventually released from its possession only to be faced down by an Arbok, owned by Koga. Charmeleon tricked Koga by using a zombie Psyduck to deflect Arbok's Acid before literally slicing the Arbok in half with his tail. Blue later appears with an evolved Charizard and gains access to Saffron City by helping to disable a barrier created by a Mr. Mime. Later, Red and Blue face off against Koga's Articuno and are frozen by its Ice Beam, but they ultimately defeat the Team Rocket Executive with Charizard's Flamethrower. It then teams up with Red's newly evolved Venusaur, Saur, and Green's Blastoise, Blasty, to defeat Sabrina's monster Pok√©mon. They end Team Rocket's control of Saffron City, splitting apart the three birds in the process. Blue's Charizard re-appeared during the final match of the ninth Pok√©mon League, against his longtime rival Red. Despite the type advantage, Charizard battles against Saur and is nearly knocked out. As the battle progresses the two trainers send out their first Pok√©mon to battle again, when Saur binds Charizard from attacking. Suddenly, thunderclouds form from the attacks of Poli and Pika, and Saur submerges a vine into the cloud, shocking Charizard and knocking it out. When the \\"FireRed and LeafGreen\\" volume of the manga began the original protagonists ‚Äì Red, Blue, and Green ‚Äì return to fight the newly formed Team Rocket and the Deoxys under their power. The three trainers become trapped inside the Trainer Tower in the Sevii Islands, battling the main computer of the building and the Deoxys Divides. After struggling to co-ordinate Blasty, Saur, and Charizard, the three trainers manage to focus the angle of the three powerful attacks ‚Äì Blast Burn, Hydro Cannon, and Frenzy Plant ‚Äì to free Mewtwo, who in turn destroys the Trainer Tower. Charizard appeared as the main Pok√©mon in the short novel, Charizard Go! Adapted by Tracey West, the novelization retells Ash's journey with his Charmander, and it reaches its climax as Ash and Charizard battle in the Pok√©mon League at the Indigo Plateau against his good friend Ritchie. The story covers Ash and his companions finding the abandoned Charmander, the battles in which Charmeleon did not listen to Ash, and Charizard's battle against Blaine's Magmar. Charizard Go! is the sixth novel in the Pok√©mon Chapter Books series.West, Tracey. Charizard Go!. Scholastic Publishing, April 2000. . Another chapter novel, All Fired Up: Pok√©mon the Johto Journeys, adapted by Jennifer Johnson, covers the portion of Ash's journey near Violet City and the Characific Valley. In the novel, Ash wonders if Charizard should leave his team forever; it covers the capture of Ash's Cyndaquil, his new fire Pok√©mon.Johnson, Jennifer. All Fired Up: Pok√©mon the Johto Journeys.

Reception Charizard has been featured in lines of soft toys and action figures in the Pok√©mon franchise, made by Hasbro, and Tomy.\\"Recall of Pok√©mon plush toys \\" Cpsc.org'.' Retrieved 12 July 2006. In 2004, the \\"Charizard Medium Plush\\" was part of a major recall of 13 plush toys due to a manufacturing fault where tips of needles were being found with the stuffing. This allowed Tomy to replace the toys with compensation or replacements. Charizard appears often in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, most notably in the series' initial release. Cards featuring the character have been stated to be the most desired of the series, quickly rising to high prices amongst collectors and retailers. In 2005, search engine Yahoo! reported Charizard as \\"one of the top Pok√©mon- related web searches\\". Described by the media as \\"a lean, ferocious, fire- breathing dragon [...] sleek, powerful, and utterly destructive\\", Charizard has been noted as one of the franchise's \\"most popular\\" characters. Retailers have attributed the high sales of merchandise related to the character to the popularity of the character's dragon-like design with children. Interviewed children have stated similar; they attributed its appeal to its \\"cool looking\\" appearance and associating the character with the \\"concepts of stubbornness and power\\". The book Rebuilding Attachments With Traumatized Children stated psychiatrists utilized the character as an empowered character traumatized children who were fans of the Pok√©mon series could relate to. The book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pok√©mon cited Charizard as \\"popular\\" with older male children who tend to be drawn to \\"tough or scary\\" characters, and compared the character's evolution from Charmander into Charizard with the loss of \\"cuteness\\" as one leaves childhood. IGN editor \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" called Charizard \\"certainly the most popular and perhaps the most well-balanced of any of the current starting Pokemon\\". GamesRadar's Brett Elston described Charizard as \\"hands-down one of the coolest Pok√©mon out there\\", heavily praising its character design and calling it \\"one of the coolest\\" designs of the entire series. GamesRadar editor Raymond Padilla stated \\"Charizard was an awesome Pokemon back in the day and still an excellent choice more than a decade after it was introduced.\\" UGO.com described Charizard as a \\"winged, dragon-like creature\\" which is \\"able to breathe fire and smash opponents into red-tinged goo\\", but states that in Brawl, it is \\"as slow as Bowser\\" and \\"lacks the coolness factor of Mario's arch-nemesis.\\" Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Charizard the \\"best Fire type Pok√©mon\\" and the \\"third best Pok√©mon overall\\". They wrote that \\"there was nothing else that could better fit that spot\\" and that \\"it has won [their] hearts and had [them] cheering for more.\\" 1UP editor Kat Bailey expressed concern about which Pok√©mon could follow the player in Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating \\"allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well\\". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard \\"the most dominant Pok√©mon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength\\". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the \\"best Pok√©mon\\", where the staff commented about remembering being torn between choosing Blastoise and Charizard at the start of the game. In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Charizard was voted as the \\"best Fire-type Pok√©mon\\". They stated, \\"not only is Charizard your favourite fire Pok√©mon, but it is probably one of the most popular 'mon of all time\\". Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type. Game Informer ranked Charizard as the \\"coolest Pok√©mon out of the original 151\\", describing it as \\"Powerful, gigantic, and imposing\\". They further commented that \\"Pikachu may be the one you recognize, but Charizard is the one you want.\\" References External links * Charizard on Bulbapedia * Charizard on Pokemon.com Category:Dragon characters in video games Category:Pok√©mon species Category:Super Smash Bros. fighters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1996 Category:Video game characters with air or wind abilities Category:Video game characters with fire or heat abilities Category:Video game mascots ca:L√≠nia evolutiva de Charmander#Charizard cs:Seznam pok√©mon≈Ø (1-20)#Charizard da:Pok√©mon (1-20)#Charizard fr:Salam√®che et ses √©volutions#Dracaufeu pl:Lista Pok√©mon√≥w (1-20)#Charizard ","title":"Charizard"},{"id":"24198909","text":"Ronald Rhodes (31 October 1937 ‚Äì 12 January 1962) was a British sprint canoer who competed in the early 1960s.

Newman and starring Jeanne Crain and Michael Rennie, based on the 1943 play Cabin B-13 by John Dickson Carr.. The plot of the film centers on the gaslighting of a female protagonist aboard a cruise vessel. Plot Attractive newlywed Ruth (Stanton) Bowman (Jeanne Crain) joyously starts a honeymoon cruise to Europe with her husband John Bowman (Carl Betz), only to have him go missing shortly after they check into their cabin. Compounding her confusion, Ruth finds that she is registered solo under her maiden name in a different cabin and that none of the crew members who could have seen her husband on the ship remember him. These include the ship's purser (Gayne Whitman), stewardess Anna Quinn (Mary Anderson), and second officer Jim Logan (Max Showalter). After she talks to the captain (Willis Bouchey), he orders the ship searched for the missing John Bowman. However, the captain notices that Ruth isn't even wearing a wedding ring, and the crew begin suggesting Ruth is mentally unbalanced. That night, John telephones Ruth with a cryptic warning not to trust anyone. A divorcee traveling solo (Marjorie Hoshelle) and the stewardess take an interest in Ruth. Meanwhile, Dr. Manning (Michael Rennie) starts a sympathetic search for the facts, spends time with Ruth, assuming a clinical demeanour and getting her to open up about the recent death of her father, a wealthy steel executive. Ruth decides to put on an act and agrees that she's been foolish, but mysterious things continue to happen. Ruth and Dr. Manning get closer, and a man who walks with a cane seems to stalk her. Then the stewardess is revealed as conspiring with someone (by phone) to make Ruth seem unstable. Dr. Manning confronts Ruth over the fact that her marriage was either secret or non-existent. She explains that John wanted it to be quick and quiet and talks about an uncle who might scheme to get her inheritance. John calls again and asks to meet Ruth on deck but runs into the fog when he hears others approach. When Ruth escapes from the ship crew chasing her, ending up in the dance room where she is trapped and making a scene of despair, the captain demands that she be locked in her cabin. She is sedated and a strict nurse prevents her from demanding anything. Then John is revealed to be Barlowe, the third mate, under Dr. Manning's care all along for a claimed illness. When he learns Ruth has been locked in, he asks the stewardess to enable her escape. When they meet again, John attempts to throw Ruth overboard (mentioning the money of the inheritance he would get as a motive) but is stopped by Dr. Manning, who has followed her. It is John who goes overboard in the fight. Later, Dr. Manning comforts Ruth, and the captain apologizes in the name of all who didn't believe her and explains that the stewardess confessed.

Corinne Calvert and Gary Merrill were the original leads. Joseph M. Newman was originally meant to direct a film called The Raid but it was having casting issues and the director was under contract to the studio, so they transferred him to Ship Story. Eventually the lead roles were assigned to Fox contract stars Jeanne Crain and Michael Rennie. Filming started January 1953. Joseph Newman later recalled it was \\"a very low budget picture. At that time Twentieth Century Fox wanted to cut down on costs. But I think it was a good mystery. Crain and Rennie were both delightful people and pleasant to work with.\\" Reception Critical response The film critic for The New York Times gave a lukewarm review, writing > Although it maintains an eerie quality and suspense through the first half > of its footage, Dangerous Crossing, which arrived at the Globe yesterday, is > only a mildly engrossing adventure ... While sound effects, background music > and shipboard sets lend a peculiar fascination to the melodrama, the acting > of the cast adds little tautness to the proceedings. As the beleaguered > heiress Jeanne Crain is beautiful but not entirely convincing in the role > ... Dangerous Crossing, in effect, is intriguing only part of the way.... > Thereafter, it is a commonplace trip.

It was designed by architect Henry Busch in the Victorian style with Gothic Revival features. The building was commissioned by Bishop Hibbert Binney. Other buildings designed by Busch in Halifax include the Halifax Academy and the Halifax Public Gardens Bandstand. In 1994, the City of Halifax put out an RFP (Request for Proposal) for the building, but only received a few offers. Its current tenants helped form the Arts Centre Project Society in order to secure the building as an arts centre. The Arts Centre Project Society was made up: the No Money Down Cultural Society (a group of artists active in building), various individual artists (including Garry Neill Kennedy), and members from the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia. The building was established as an art centre by City Council in 1994 and a month-to-month lease was signed. In March 1995, the Khyber Arts Society was registered as a charitable organization. Recent NSCAD grad Kelly Mark ran the bar on the first floor for several years. Phil Grauer who went on to form Canada Gallery NYC served as director. Founding tenants included Chesnut Tree Theatre (Jennifer Smith) and Ultramagnetic recording studio run by Charles Austin (Superfriendz) and Kevin Lewis (Parenthesis gallery). Artists that have shown at the Khyber since then include: Luis Jacob, Emily Vey Duke & Cooper Battersby, Gillian Wearing, Kelly Mark, David Askevold, Shary Boyle, Gerald Ferguson, Alison Mitchel, Thierry Delva and the Critical Art Ensemble. The Rankin Family filmed the music video for their song \\"You Feel The Same Way Too\\" at the Khyber in the mid 1990s. In 1997, the Khyber Arts Society signed a five-year renewable lease with the City to occupy the Khyber Building. In 1998, the Khyber Club opened as a gallery space for contemporary art, a meeting place for the visual arts community and as a venue for Halifax's emerging music scene including acts by Canadian recording artists Joel Plaskett, Sloan, Eric's Trip, Elevator to Hell, Al Tuck, Soaking Up Jagged, Rick of the Skins, Julie Doiron, Jenn Grant, Old Man Luedecke, Tanya Davis, Buck 65, Skratch Bastid, Classified and Ghettosocks.

On July 13, 1906, the Toronto Terminals Railway (TTR) was incorporated to \\"construct, provide, maintain and operate at the City of Toronto a union passenger station\\". It was also responsible for the entire long railway corridor on either side of the station, between west of Bathurst Street and the Don River, known as the Union Station Rail Corridor (USRC). The TTR was jointly owned by the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway who each held 50% of the TTR shares. During station construction, the Grand Trunk Railway went bankrupt, was fully nationalized by the Government of Canada, and merged into the Canadian National Railway which would assume the Grand Trunk's 50% ownership of the TTR (and thus the third Union Station). Union Station was opened on August 6, 1927 by the Prince of Wales, although it was not completed yet. Four days later, the track network was shifted from the former second Union Station. To get to trains, passengers would walk from the south doors to the tracks located several hundred feet to the south while the new USRC viaduct, concourse and train shed was under construction. Demolition of the second Union Station began almost immediately and was completed in 1928. The third Union Station was not fully completed until 1930 when construction of the train shed had finished. The first major change to the Station took place in 1954 when the Toronto Transit Commission opened its Union subway station adjacent to Union Station, buried beneath Front Street. Redevelopment 1960s‚Äì1980s Construction for the CN Tower in railway lands in 1973. The area was to be redeveloped, with the GTA's rail lines centralized in nearby Vaughan. However, most of these plans were scrapped after the tower's completion. Going as far back as 1965, when CN began to shift the functions of many of its yards in the Greater Toronto Area to a centralized facility in the northern suburb of Vaughan, the railways lands were made redundant. The yards' layout was also becoming increasingly outdated then. The area was then slated for re-development for post-railway beginning with plans for the building of a communications tower (the CN Tower) and the massive Metro Centre. Two years into the construction of the CN Tower, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. Development of the Railway Lands slowed between the 1970s and 1980.A visual history of the Toronto Railway Lands. Blogto.com (2011-11-03). Retrieved on July 26, 2013. The early 1980s saw more redevelopment, with the opening of the Metro Convention Centre in 1984. The late 1980s saw the building of the SkyDome (for which the CNR Spadina Roundhouse was demolished) and the SkyWalk connecting the SkyDome with Union Station. 1990s‚Äì2000s In the early 1990s redevelopment slowed, but it did see the expansion of the convention centre and the John Street Roundhouse redeveloped into the Roundhouse Park, though it would not be restored until the 2000s. It also saw the building of Air Canada Centre (since renamed to Scotiabank Arena) in the late 1990s along the eastern boundary of the Railway Lands. Railway lands west of the CN Tower in 1999. Shortly after the new millennium, the area saw new development that changed the area forever. In the early 21st Century, the remaining area began to change rapidly with residential and then commercial development changing the area's past use. The western portion of the Railway Lands, defined by the city as Railway Lands West, is today home to the CityPlace neighbourhood built just west of Spadina Avenue, south of Front Street and north of the Gardiner Expressway. Railway Lands Central is mixed use land slightly east of Spadina to the area east of the CN Tower is home to Rogers Centre and CN Tower and parts of CityPlace. Railway Lands East is now the South Core neighbourhood and is a mixed used land slightly east of Rogers Centre and is home to Union Station (and Union Station Bus Terminal), Dominion Public Building, SkyWalk, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Roundhouse Park, Steam Whistle Brewing, Southcore Financial Centre, Delta Hotel Toronto, Maple Leaf Square and Scotiabank Arena. On August 3, 2016, Mayor John Tory announced a proposal to create a Rail Deck Park, decking over the Railway Lands West section to provide additional parkland in Downtown Toronto. The proposed greenspace would comprise 8.3 hectares. The only remaining rail connection is the Union Station Rail Corridor, which is maintained by Toronto Terminals Railway and consists of the narrow area used by tracks leading into and out of Union Station. The SkyWalk transverses a large part of the former Railway Lands, connecting Union Station with the lands south of the rail corridor.

It was developed by Eisai Co. and acts as a multiple kinase inhibitor against the VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 kinases. Medical uses Lenvatinib is approved (since 2015) for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer that is either locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, and did not respond to treatment with radioactive iodine (radioiodine). for Lenvima. In May 2016, the US FDA approved it (in combination with everolimus) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The drug is also approved in the US and in Europe for hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be removed surgically in patients who have not received cancer therapy by mouth or injection. Adverse effects Hypertension (high blood pressure) was the most common side effect in studies (73% of patients, versus 16% in the placebo group), followed by diarrhoea (67% vs. 17%) and fatigue (67% vs. 35%). Other common side effects included decreased appetite, hypotension (low blood pressure), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), nausea, muscle and bone pain.  Interactions  As lenvatinib moderately prolongs QT time, addition of other drugs with this property could increase the risk of a type of abnormal heart rhythm, namely torsades de pointes. No relevant interactions with enzyme inhibitors and inducers are expected. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Lenvatinib acts as a multiple kinase inhibitor. It inhibits the three main vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR1, 2 and 3, as well as fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 and 4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, c-Kit, and the RET proto-oncogene. Some of these proteins play roles in cancerogenic signalling pathways. VEGFR2 inhibition is thought to be the main reason for the most common side effect, hypertension. Pharmacokinetics Lenvatinib is absorbed quickly from the gut, reaching peak blood plasma concentrations after one to four hours (three to seven hours if taken with food). Bioavailability is estimated to be about 85%. The substance is almost completely (98‚Äì99%) bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Lenvatinib is oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), and further metabolized to the quinolinones M2' and M3' by aldehyde oxidase (AO). Lenvatinib is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 to desmethyl-lenvatinib (M2). M2 and lenvatinib itself are oxidized by aldehyde oxidase (AO) to substances called M2' and M3', the main metabolites in the feces. Another metabolite, also mediated by a CYP enzyme, is the N-oxide M3. Non-enzymatic metabolization also occurs, resulting in a low potential for interactions with enzyme inhibitors and inducers. Terminal half-life is 28 hours, with about two thirds being excreted via the feces, and one quarter via the urine. Chemistry Lenvatinib is used in form of the mesylate salt (CAS number ). History A phase I clinical trial in cancer patients was performed in 2006. A phase III trial treating thyroid cancer patients started in March 2011. Lenvatinib was granted orphan drug status for treatment of various types of thyroid cancer that do not respond to radioiodine in the US and Japan in 2012 and in Europe in 2013. In February 2015, the U.S. FDA approved lenvatinib for treatment of progressive, radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Hematology/Oncology (Cancer) Approvals & Safety Notifications. In May 2015, European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the drug for the same indication. In May 2016, the FDA approved it (in combination with everolimus) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

Rockmont was founded in 1956 on the former campus of Black Mountain College.Black Mountain College Historic District Asheville, North Carolina National Park Service There are four \\"classic\\" sessions held each summer (13 days), as well as a one week starter session. Within the classic sessions are a three and four week option for more experienced campers. Capacity for each session is about 400 boys, with each session varying slightly depending on enrollment.  History  Rockmont was founded in 1956 by George Pickering on the campus of Black Mountain College, which had recently closed. It was founded as a boys-only Christian camp, and carried an American Indian theme. This Native American theme continued until 2000, at which time the theme was dropped, but still holds roots to it through the ceremonial \\"council\\". The camp is run by Dan Davis who took over the position of Director in 2006 from David Bruce, now the Manager/CEO. David Bruce is also the Executive Director of the Rockmont Alumni Association.  Structure   Age Division  Rockmont is rather large for a summer camp, with around 400 boys per session ranging from ages 6 to 16. The camp is divided up into different groups based on age and each boy is placed in a cabin with 7 to 14 boys his age and 1 or 2 counselors. Campers spend a large amount of time with their cabin, including sleeping in the same cabin and eating with their counselors in the dining hall. The cabins are numbered from youngest to oldest: 1 through 40, 6.5 (65), 18.5 (185), 42, 43 and 44. (41 is skipped numerically in honor of old camp lore.) Each cabin is part of a larger \\"tribe\\", which generally include 6 to 8 cabins. The 6 tribes, from youngest to oldest, are Buckeye, Birch, Hickory, Hemlock, Poplar, and Sycamore. Tribes often do activities together, and sometimes compete against or with other tribes in games. Each tribe has a Tribal Director (TD) assigned to it, whose purpose is to plan, run, and manage activities, as well as to support the cabin staff within their tribe. Each tribe is also part of another larger camp. The camp is divided into junior camp, better known as Bear Camp (Camp for younger children), intermediate camp (Deer Camp), and senior camp (Mountain Camp). The Buckeye and Birch tribes make up Bear Camp, the Hickory and Hemlock tribes form Deer Camp, and the Poplar and Sycamore tribes form Mountain Camp.  Sessions  Rockmont is open for 5 sessions each summer, for a total of 9 weeks. The shortest stay (6 days) is Starter camp, usually attended by first time, younger campers. The 4 \\"classic camp\\" sessions are Classic 1 through 4. Base camp is the three week option, and Summit camp is the longest stay at four weeks.  Experience  The main offices for Camp Rockmont, known as the Ship Rockmont offers a range of different activities for campers to take part in, from traditional sports such as Soccer and Basketball, to shooting skills such as Archery and Riflery, as well as creative activities like Ceramics and Rocketry. Campers sign up for 6 of these activities before they attend in the summer, and each day visit 2 of their 4 \\"skills\\". Beyond that, each day also includes 1 to 2 \\"tribal activities\\", which are usually large group games such as Gladiator (Capture the Flag), Behind Enemy Lines, Invasion or Battleball (Dodgeball). Campers also get a free period every day, called Free Swim, and a Rest Period following Lunch. Rockmont also puts a focus on Christian ideals. Counselors give devotions to their cabins every night, usually talking about a bible verse or telling a personal story relating to it. As well, every morning each tribe participates in a \\"Morning Watch\\", in which the tribe sings camp songs, and the Tribal Director gives a devotion to the tribe. Also important to the Christian ideal of the camp is the council system. Council Every Sunday, each camp gathers at their \\"council ring\\" and recognizes campers for ways throughout the week that they grew and became closer to God. Every Council has a traditional rule of silence and usually must hold that silence until back to their cabin. Council is made up of Tribal Directors, Camp Directors, and Paladins, all hold \\"council names\\". The Paladins, is a group of campers (within Mountain Camp) that can be chosen and receive a ring as well as serve in council. Paladins are known to serve for life, as Paladins who return as councilors still hold the name and ring. Much of the Paladin initiation and selection is shrouded in mystery as the men who do serve are sworn to secrecy. The only publicly known challenge of becoming a Paladin is 24 hour silence, where the pledge can not speak or make (purposeful) grunts, hums, etc.  Registration  Camper registration costs about $1700 per week, though this amount varies with the session chosen. Campers never need to pay any money at camp, though they are allowed to use money from an account set up by the parents to purchase items at the camp store.  Related organizations   Rockmont Alumni Association  The Rockmont Alumni Association (RAA) is an organization founded by former Camp Rockmont Director and current CEO, R. David Bruce. In 2006, the RAA hosted a reunion to celebrate the Camp's 50th summer of operation. The event's success prompted the RAA to begin hosting similar events every 5 years starting in August, 2010.  Camp Diversity Foundation  The Camp Diversity Foundation (CDF) is a non-profit organization based in Black Mountain, North Carolina which aims to provide a Christian summer camp experience to financially disadvantaged children. The CDF uses Camp Rockmont's facilities to host its one-week \\"Adventure Camp\\" at the end of Camp Rockmont's regular camp season. The Camp Diversity Foundation is promoted by the Rockmont Alumni Association, and receives financial support from its members.

The total community size is 30,000 (approximately) as of mid-2009. They are spread over these 5 districts and in a few other places. In India, the number of Mahali is around 565,000. Anthropologically, they are an Austro-Asiatic tribe. Their forefathers came to this region from the Buru Disham hills of Jharkhand, India over a century ago.Zakarias Dumri, BA (Hons), MA in History from Rajshahi University & Director-MAASAUS, a centre working for development of the Mahles located at Village-Damkura, PS-Poba, District-Rajshahi They speak either their own indigenous community language called Mahle Language or Santali (Saontali), though today's educated generation speak Bengali and English as well. There are 3 tribes among them: Nagpuriya, Sikroya and Rajmahle. A total of 9 family names can be found among the Mahles ‚Äì Dumri, Bare, Karkusho, Kauria, Khanger, Mandri, Hansda, Baske & Besra, of which the first 4 family names are almost extinct today.'The Mahali Community of Damkura', Sheikh Mehedi Hasan , The Daily Prothom Alo, 24-Aug-2009. Traditions The Mahali people cannot marry within close relatives or within their own tribe. There are two ways of effecting the marriage ‚Äì Angir Bapla & Sunum Bapla. The society is patriarchal, and in marriages the family of the bridegroom pays dowry to the family of the bride. Children bear the family name inherited from the father. The primary profession of the community is manufacturing useful household articles using bamboo, e.g., dali (bin), kula (an indigenous multipurpose article used in processing rice/paddy), tungki (a bamboo-made pot to keep salt), hand propelled fan, etc., and selling these in the local markets. They earn very little each day, but live on whatever their traditional trade fetches them. Intra-community harmony is excellent. Their food habits are just like those of other Bangladeshi residents of the region, although they do not eat crab, oyster or pork. Their attire is a mixture of Bangladeshi Muslim and Hindu culture, though many Mahalis wear modern dresses like shirt-trousers and salwar-kameez. Mahali children are not proficient at Bengali Medium primary schools because there is hardly any scope of learning Bengali in their environment. The native tongue of the Mahle community has no written form. Mr. Zakarias Dumri, Director-MAASAUS and a Mahali by himself, has invented a Romanized Mahle alphabet for their language, which is being used experimentally in 3 primary schools of Damkurahat, Paba, Rajshahi. The schools are Sursunipara, Sinjaghutu and Pipra Multi Linguistic Education (MLE) schools. This new alphabet allows Mahali children to study in Bengali as well as their native language, and, as a result, literacy has increased in that area. Children are also showing better results in the schools. Teachers of the school and NGOs named SIL-Bangladesh and Manusher Jonno (for the mankind) are helping the children in this endeavor.'Short Introduction to the culture and lifestyle of the Mahali Community', Edited by Zakarias Dumri, Published by MAASAUS, Damkura, Rajshahi, February 2009. There are three major festivals of the Mahalis ‚Äì Jitiya Parbon, Syurjahi Puja and Goal Puja, falling in the months of Bhadra (Mid-August to Mid September) and Falgun (Mid February to Mid March) of the Bengali calendar. Singing and dancing are integral parts of their festivals and celebrations. Jhumer is a prominent form of dance among this community, and almost every Mahle is adept at this dance (However, many Mahalis of the current generation do not know this dance well). They use traditional musical instruments in their music and dance. They refrain from all household activities on the festival days in the belief that acting otherwise might bring bad luck to their family. They cremate their dead as the Hindus do. Kula (Hatak in their language) is very important in their day-to- day life, as well as in religious practices. They use the kula to harvest rice and value the Kula as a religious symbol.

The village lies on the Black Brook, a tributary of the River Walkham, about south-east of Tavistock, near the villages of Horrabridge, Yelverton and Dousland. Burrator Reservoir, constructed in 1898, is to the south-east. In 2001 the population of the parish was 863. For administrative purposes the parish is grouped with the parishes of Meavy and Sheepstor to form Burrator Parish Council, and for electoral purposes it is grouped with the same two parishes to form Burrator Ward. The village has a pub, the Walkhampton Inn, dating from the 17th century, and a primary school named Lady Modiford's School which was founded in 1719, though the present building with its distinctive bell and clock tower dates from the second half of the 19th century. In 2004 the school had 119 pupils in four classes. Walkhampton church, which is Grade I listed, is on an ancient elevated site about half a mile north-west of the village. Unlike most churches which face east, it faces north-east, the direction of the rising sun on the longest day. The present building, which is built of granite and has a tower with four prominent pinnacles, dates from the 15th century, with much later alteration, including restoration in 1860‚Äì61. For 400 years until 1985 the church had no dedication and was known simply as \\"Walkhampton Church\\", but in that year it was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. Research has indicated that it may have been originally dedicated to St Dionisius of Walkynton. Church House, bearing the date 1698, but substantially 16th century in construction, is near the church. It was once an inn. Also nearby is an ancient stone cross which was reconstructed from parts found in a hedge. The base and shaft were re-erected in 1984 by relatives of the Lieutenant Goldsmith who in 1903 had discovered a cross on the moor; a head was added in 1991. On the moorland above the village is Walkhampton Common which contains many important archaeological sites including at least eight stone rows, many cairns, cists, hut circles and reaves dating to the Bronze Age. There is also much evidence of tin mining from medieval times and later.

The term can be translated literally as \\"in front of the board,\\" referring to a cutting board. While it is not necessary to be Japanese in order to be considered an itamae, non-Japanese people must prove themselves worthy of such a title. In his book The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi: Everything You Need to Know About Sushi, Dave Lowry describes four criteria to judge a good itamae: * How they handle the food; * How they handle their food utensils (basically their knives); * How they treat their clients; and * How they behave, move and work. Itamae as sushi chef In the western world, an itamae is often associated with sushi (also commonly referred to simply as \\"sushi chefs\\"). In Japan, becoming an itamae of sushi requires years of training and apprenticeship. Typically, after spending approximately five years working with a master itamae, the apprentice is given their first important task related to making sushi: preparation of the sushi rice. The rice is prepared according to the strict instructions of the senior itamae, and each sushi restaurant has its own \\"secret\\" recipe of rice, salt, and rice vinegar. Once the senior itamae is satisfied with the consistency of the sushi rice made daily by the apprentice, the apprentice may then be promoted. This promotion puts the apprentice in a more prominent location, next to the senior itamae. This position is called \\"wakiita,\\" which translates to \\"near the cutting board.\\" The wakiita's duties expand to include daily preparation of the fresh ingredients, such as preparing blocks of fish, grating ginger, and slicing scallions. Eventually, the apprentice might begin to prepare sushi for clients with take-away orders. The wakiita also learns the proper ways to interact with and treat the restaurant's customers by observing the senior itamae. After additional years of training as a wakiita, the apprentice can be appointed an itamae, fully authorized to stand in front of the cutting board. The creation of sushi is an art and has colorful stories associated with it. It is a common Japanese legend that the truly great itamae-san (\\"san\\" is an honorific suffix) should be able to create nigirizushi in which all of the rice grains face the same direction. In Japan, the itamae is still the heart of the traditional sushi bar and follows many traditions not practiced elsewhere in the world. For example, part of the itamae's art is calculating the bill. Mistakes in the calculation, unintentional or intentional (for particularly good customers), may occur. Itamae training is conducted all over the world, including Japan, USA, and in the UK. The process can take anywhere between 2 years and 20 years. The terms ‚ÄúItamae‚Äù and ‚ÄúShokunin‚Äù are used as a title for the chef. ‚ÄúItamae‚Äù refers to a skilled sushi chef, while Shokunin means simply someone skilled at a profession.

Biography Currently, F√°bio Caramuru develops two main projects: EcoM√∫sica Project and Tom Jobim for Piano. The EcoMusica Project has been developed by Caramuru since 2013. It is a pioneering initiative, dedicated to the Brazilian nature, that mixes his music and sounds of nature in an inventive way, with the important mission of alerting for the preservation of the environment. Through this project Caramuru already released the albums EcoMusica Dialogues between a piano and the Brazilian fauna (2015) and EcoMusica Aves (Birds of Japan) (2018), many music videos such as Cicada, Tico-tico, Bem-te-vi, Harpy Eagle, Macaws, Hidorigamo and Quero-quero (all available on Caramuru's YouTube Channel), as well as several EcoMusica Concerts in Brazil, Japan, and Canada. In September 2020, the pianist released the video Amazonia EcoMusica Uirapuru, a legend of the forest. The video was directed by Otavio Dias, Cecilia Lucchesi was in charge of the scene research and the script was written by Caramuru himself. It was produced entirely during the social distancing period, and this new work portraits the musician on an imaginary trip from his living room to the depths of Brazilian Amazon forest, as he is lured by the mysterious song of the legendary bird Uirapuru, which is rarely seen. Fabio Caramuru's distinctive style is a fresh blend of classic compositional techniques with a contemporary flair. For the EcoMusica repertoire, Fabio's main thematic materials are borrowed primarily from bird songs and nature sounds, crafted in elaborated soundscapes for the piano. Tom Jobim for Piano and on Radio In the past 25 years, the pianist has been developing a consistent research on Tom Jobim. His master's degree at S√£o Paulo University (2000) was dedicated to the aspects of piano performance on Tom Jobim's music. In 2017, he released a double album Tom Jobim - Piano by F√°bio Caramuru performing his own arrangements for 28 of some of the most famous Jobim's works (Flau Japan). His Piano Duo Brasil em Dois Pianos, created by Caramuru and the pianist Marco Bernardo, have been presenting the Brazilian repertoire, mainly Tom Jobim's pieces, in many concerts in Brazil. Most of the arrangements are exclusive and written by Marco Bernardo. Caramuru also presents EcoMusica and Tom Jobim's pieces in solo concerts and with orchestras in Brazil, Japan and Europe as well. In 2020, Caramuru and Babu Ba√≠a started a radio program about Tom Jobim (Cultura FM, S√£o Paulo, Brazil - 103.3 MHZ). The first years and other cultural projects F√°bio Caramuru first began his professional career as an architect. It was not too long, however, before he exchanged architecture for music. After being granted a scholarship by the French Government in 1980, Caramuru moved to Paris where he studied under the supervision of the great Brazilian-French pianist Magda Tagliaferro. After his return to Brazil, Caramuru undertook a position at the board of directors of the Magda Tagliaferro Foundation in S√£o Paulo. His many musical projects included Camargo Guarnieri and Magda Tagliaferro festivals, a project about the history of the Brazilian music and several records, among which an album about Brazilian composers, and his own piano solo arrangements on Tom Jobim's songs. In 2005, the French pianists Katia and Marielle Lab√®que performed Tom Jobim's Chovendo na Roseira, the first of a series of arrangements for two pianos written by F√°bio Caramuru. Caramuru formed the Duo Caramuru/Baldanza with the bass player Pedro Baldanza. Among Caramuru's outstanding appearances are a concert with Minas Gerais Philharmonic Orchestra (Stravinsky), S√£o Paulo Symphonic Brass Orchestra (Tom Jobim), S√£o Paulo University Symphonic Orchestra (Poulenc) and Jazz Symphonic Orchestra, the latter performing special arrangements of Nino Rota‚Äôs and Richard Rodgers movie soundtracks; the concerts with the singers Fernando Portari and Magda Painno; his double-CD Piano - Tom Jobim por F√°bio Caramuru celebrating the 80th Tom Jobim‚Äôs anniversary, and the innovative and acclaimed CD Bossa in the Shadows, with the remarkable contribution of bass player Pedro Baldanza. In November 2010, Caramuru made a Brazilian Music Recital in Toronto (Victoria Chapel / Toronto University) and a Brazilian Jazz Show at Zinc Bar in New York City. In 2011, a European tour included two concerts with Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra in Belgium, and shows at JazzStation in Brussels and at Jazz Club Moods in Zurich. In 2012, he performed as soloist with ORTHESP Orchestra in S√£o Paulo, as well as at the International Jazz Festival in Havana, Cuba. In 2013, he performed at the renowned Club Reserva in Gent, Belgium, and started the research for the project EcoM√∫sica, based on the interaction between sounds of nature and the piano. In 2014, he directed and performed as soloist in projects such as the one which marked Tom Jobim's 20 years of departure at Caixa Cultural S√£o Paulo, and \\"Brazil in Two Pianos\\", a national tour, with the pianist Barco Bernardo, as well as at Instrumental SESC Brasil. In 2015, Caramuru released his CD Ecom√∫sica |Dialogues between a piano and the Brazilian fauna, also available in Japanese edition since September 2016 by Label Flau. In April 2016, Caramuru's innovative video clip EcoM√∫sica Cicada was released with a concert at Sala S√£o Paulo. In 2017, F√°bio Caramuru had eight concerts scheduled in several Japanese cities, as well as concerts EcoM√∫sica at Audit√≥rio Ibirapuera, a new video and concerts for EcoM√∫sica Rio de Janeiro and a two-piano tribute to Tom Jobim at Sala S√£o Paulo. In 2017, his album Tom Jobim by Fabio Caramuru as well as D√≥ R√© Mi Fon Fon (27 Brazilian Nursery Songs) were released by Flau in Japan. In 2018, the pianist released his second album EcoMusica, EcoM√∫sica Aves (Flau, Japan), having 20 different Japanese birds as inspiration. He has also made two major concerts in S√£o Paulo - Sala S√£o Paulo and Audit√≥rio Ibirapuera - both dedicated to the 110th Anniversary of Japanese Immigration in Brazil. Caramuru also released four new videos EcoM√∫sica: Bem-te-vi, Harpia (with the dancer ismael Ivo), Araras and Hidorigamo (with the ceramicist Hideko Honma), all of them available on his YouTube channel. The video EcoM√∫sica Harpia was awarded the prize Masters of Creativity by the prestigious portal Catraca Livre. In 2019, Caramuru continued to develop the EcoM√∫sica Project, presenting it in concerts in Brazil (SESC, Japan House) and Canada, celebrating the 5th Anniversary of Cafe & Cultura Toronto, at Granite Club. Among his projects in 2020, there was Two Piano Concert at Sala S√£o Paulo, presenting his Duo Brasil em Dois Pianos, in February, an online concert promoted by SESC S√£o Paulo, a new video EcoM√∫sica - Amazonia Uirapuru and new videos dedicated to Tom Jobim will be released along the year.

It was designed in the mid-19th century by Richard Upjohn, who resided in the area for the last years of his life. Later on it became the Malcolm Gordon School, and it is currently the headquarters of the Hastings Center, a prominent bioethics research institution. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property Woodlawn is a property on the west side of NY 9D just south of St. Basil Academy, at one time the estate of New York Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert. It is a complex of several buildings, three of which are considered contributing resources to the Register listing. The main house is a two-story brick structure on a stone foundation. There are frame single-story additions on the north and east. Its steeply-pitched cross-gabled roof, with exposed rafters at the eaves, is pierced by two dormer windows on either side and a brick chimney at the south end. On the west (front) facade is an oriel window with a balcony above. A porch with Corinthian columns wraps around the south and west sides of the house. On the east the addition, originally built as a detached gym and now the center's Morison Library, is now connected to the house via a breezeway. The north extension projects from the porch and includes a garage, workshop, and apartment. A small stucco kitchen wing has been added to the north side of the house as well. The three detached buildings are a combination stable and hayloft, carriage shed and ice house. The first, a one-story stucco structure, has since been converted into an apartment. The shed and ice house, frame and board-and-batten respectively, are now used for storage. West elevations of main block and northern extension, 2014. South elevation of main block, 2014. History William Moore, a partner in a large New York City importing firm, commissioned Upjohn to design the house in 1854. He and his wife and their descendants used it as a summer residence until it was purchased by Malcolm Gordon in 1927 to start the boys' boarding school he named after himself. Gordon made the changes to the property. The north wing was built in 1931 and expanded eight years later. Two decades later, in 1956, the gym was added. The kitchen wing was built in 1966, and three years later the garage on the north wing was added. The school remained active until the early 1980s. The Hastings Center moved in a decade later. Some renovations were necessary.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Jynx first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, or animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The character is voiced in Japanese by Mayumi Tanaka and by Rachael Lillis in English. Jynx's design and humanoid appearance has been heavily criticized by the Western media, most notably by cultural critic Carole Boston Weatherford, who described Jynx as representing blackface after seeing the character's depiction in the anime. Due to complaints, Game Freak modified its appearance by changing the original color of its face from black to the current color, purple. Design and characteristics Jynx was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Originally called \\"Rujura\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features, when translating the game for western audiences, as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed \\"Jynx\\", a play on the word \\"jinx\\". Also known as the \\"Human Shape\\" Pok√©mon, Jynx is a female-only species that resembles the Japanese mythical creatures Yamauba and Yuki-onna. Originally portrayed with a black face and hands, Jynx's design was changed to purple coloration after critiques that it perpetuated racism. In addition Jynx have large pink lips, saucer-like eyes, white arms, and long, blond hair. The \\"clothes\\" they appear to wear are actually part of their body, resembling a circular red bra and skirt. Jynx have no visible feet, and in the games leave no footprints. Jynx has a pre- evolution, Smoochum, which evolves into Jynx when it receives enough experience from battles and reaches level 30. Jynx Pok√©mon walk in a dance- like fashion, wiggling their hips in a manner described by Nintendo as \\"seductive\\". It uses dancing to communicate, with the exact rhythm relying on its emotion at the time. The dance affects people, causing them to themselves dance with no regard to their actions. Jynx speak in a language that only other Jynx can understand, though the sound is described as similar to human speech. This trait is carried on to games where Pok√©mon speak English such as the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon series, with the text appearing as combinations of \\"X\\"s, \\"O\\"s, punctuation marks, and/or musical notes, instead of legible words. Jynx are psychic, and can attack either by kissing an opponent or launching \\"strange orbs\\" at them, and can protect themselves with a psychically- generated barrier. Appearances In video games In Pok√©mon Red and Blue and their remakes, Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Jynx is a rare Pok√©mon that is only available through trading with an in-game NPC. In addition, the Kanto Elite Four member Lorelei uses a Jynx on her team. Jynx is unobtainable outside of trading in the enhanced version of Red and Blue, Pok√©mon Yellow, but she appears in the wild in its remakes, Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!. The second generation of Pok√©mon games introduced Smoochum, a baby Pok√©mon who Jynx evolves from at level 30. Jynx appears in the wild in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, Pok√©mon Crystal, and the Nintendo DS remake, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Will, a member of the Johto Elite Four, uses a Jynx on his team. Jynx also appears as a wild Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Platinum, Pok√©mon Black and White, Pok√©mon X and Y, and Pok√©mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Outside of the main series, Jynx appears in a majority of Pok√©mon spin-off titles, including Pok√©mon Snap, Pok√©mon Pinball, the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pok√©mon Ranger games, and Pok√©mon Go. Because of the controversy surrounding Jynx's skin color, it was changed from black to purple in Pok√©mon Stadium 2 and all subsequent games. In anime Jynx first appeared in the Pok√©mon anime in Holiday Hi-Jynx when one of Santa Claus's Jynx was separated from him, Ash and friends helped to return the Jynx to her owner. The episode was not re-aired in the USA because of the controversy over her appearance. However, it was placed on On-Demand on 2011, thus rendering it available to audiences in the US. Jynx appeared again in the episode The Ice Cave, which was not aired in English-speaking countries for the same reason. Jynx also made a cameo as a doll that Misty wins. Jynx later appears in Pok√©mon Orange Islands series, in episodes still present in American rotations. Jynx made an appearance in a contest in All Things Bright and Beautifly. However, because Jynx had been animated with black skin instead of purple, her 13-second appearance was cut from the English dub. Jynx later appears in episodes 116 and 117 of Pok√©mon: Advanced Generation, with the inoffensive purple skin color. Because the main order of these episodes would have been during February which is also Black History Month, KidsWB chose to air these episodes out of order and air them in April after the Hoenn Championship League episodes as it would help build the ratings with the Grand Festival and Hoenn League episodes and it would have avoided offending people during February due to the Jynx controversy. However one exception was in the episode Hi Ho Silver Wind! where a purple Jynx had a minor cameo which aired in February. These episodes were aired in the normal rotational order in the UK. A trio of Jynx sisters were later depicted in the episode Three Jynx and a Baby. These three Jynx were overly-protective towards their sister, a Smoochum. The Smoochum evolved into a Jynx at the end of the episode. In printed material Jynx's most notable role in the Pok√©mon manga is being under the ownership of Lorelei in Pok√©mon Adventures. Lorelei's Jynx is noted for having the ability to generate voodoo dolls out of ice using its Ice Beam. When Lorelei draws crosses on any part of the dolls using her lipstick, ice shackles form on the specified body parts of her targets, eventually freezing the victim over completely. Even after the victims are broken free, the freeze induces lasting numbness in the areas where it was applied. Both Red and Sabrina suffered this condition and had to seek a cure atop Mt. Silver by bathing in the hotsprings there. Another ability of Lorelei's Jynx is revealed in the Sevii Islands saga: she can create a wispy band of ice around targets, with which Lorelei can use to track down using her powder case. Jynx has made a number of appearances in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, with the black-skinned design (sometimes US version cards show up purple and edited before the controversy) before the Weatherford controversy, and with the purple-skinned design after Nintendo regained control of the Pok√©mon TCG. Jynx first appeared in the Base Set with her black-skinned design, but later reprints of this card have the purple-skinned design. Controversy and reception Jynx's original design has been heavily criticized as resembling blackface actors Jynx's original appearance and design have received criticisms in various publications. Children's book author and cultural critic Carole Boston Weatherford published an article in the Greensboro News & Record alleging that Jynx's design bore a striking resemblance to blackface actors, an image which is considered racist against black people, and further described the Pok√©mon as \\"a dead ringer for an obese drag queen.\\" She further criticized the Pok√©mon in the magazine Advertising Age, comparing it to Little Black Sambo and suggesting its English name as also a possible derogatory remark towards Black people relating to voodoo (with its original Japanese name, Rougela, being unrelated).https://web.archive.org/web/20080925070143/http://hk.geocities.com/hksar_dolphin/cbw1.htm The Advertising Age report was later reprinted in an issue of Black People Today. Since then, the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University has listed Jynx as an example of racism in modern material. In response, Game Freak modified Jynx's design in localized versions of the games, a change which would several years later be reflected in the Japanese versions of the games and the anime series. In addition, episodes featuring the older Jynx design were censored or completely removed from televised syndication by Warner Bros. Criticisms still persist, such as 1UP.com which, in an article discussing the \\"lamest Pok√©mon\\" of the series, referred to it as the \\"infamous blackface Pok√©mon\\". Washington Post writer Mary C. Morton described Jynx as having \\"explicitly, albeit grossly caricatured, womanly features\\", and challenged the assertion that the games crossed gender barriers with such. In their podcast, Retronauts, they emphasized it further, noting the design as \\"creepy\\" and that it maintained the issue of racism still. IGN also criticized the design, characterizing Jynx as a \\"transvestite midget in racially offensive makeup\\". GameDaily ranked it first on their list of the \\"Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pok√©mon\\", noting its design suggested the presence of breasts, and echoing qualms regarding its resemblance to blackface performers. Games.net ranked it fourth on their \\"Top 10 Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters\\" list, questioning why the character was clothed in what resembled a \\"slinky dress and push-up bra\\". In the book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific, David Surman defended Jynx's design, suggesting that Sugimori developed it‚Äîalong with Mr. Mime‚Äîto draw upon the humor of heta-uma (a term meaning bad/nice). The book notes that the designs \\"oscillate between the poles of good and bad,\\" and as a result offer diversity within the game and invite scrutiny from players. GamesRadar described Magmar and Jynx as the Romeo and Juliet of Pok√©mon. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson compared Jynx to the Gothita line due to both's designs being based on an \\"overtly feminine form\\", though describing Gothita's line as \\"way less creepy\\". Author Loredana Lipperini described Jynx as an \\"opera singer\\". Gudmundson listed \\"Humanoid\\" as one of the most overused Pok√©mon designs, listing Jynx and Mr. Mime as one of \\"the most infamous\\" examples.

Trygve Nagell (July 13, 1895 in Oslo - January 24, 1988 in Uppsala) was a Norwegian mathematician, known for his works on the Diophantine equations within number theory. Education and career He received his doctorate at the University of Oslo in 1926, and lectured at the University until 1931. He was a professor at the University of Uppsala from 1931 to 1962. His doctoral students include Harald Bergstr√∂m. Contributions Nagell proved a conjecture of Srinivasa Ramanujan that there are only five numbers that are both triangular numbers and Mersenne numbers. They are the numbers 0, 1, 3, 15, and 4095. The formula expressing the equality of a triangular number and a Mersenne number can be simplified to the equivalent form :2^n-7=x^2, which likewise has five solutions in natural numbers n and x, with solutions for n \\\\in\\\\\\\\{ 3, 4, 5, 7, 15 \\\\\\\\}. In honor of Nagell's solution, this equation is called the Ramanujan‚ÄìNagell equation.

He searched the harsh environments of northern Scandinavia, Siberia, Manchuria, and the dry steppes of the Volga for plant stock that could flourish on the upper Great Plains. Biography Niels Ebbesen Hansen was born the youngest of three children in Lustrupholm, Denmark, a small farm, in Ribe County, Denmark. He was the son of Danish-born muralist Andreas Hansen and Bodil Midtgaard. Hansen's mother died when he was a year and a half old. His father married Katrine Petersen two years later. Andreas Hansen emigrated to the United States in 1872 and sent for Katrine and Niels the following year. In 1876, the family moved to Des Moines, Iowa. Hansen left high school at the beginning of his junior year to work as a messenger for Iowa Secretary of State John A.T. Hull. He saved his money and continued his education through private lessons and in 1883 entered Iowa Agricultural College (Iowa State University) in Ames¬∑. Funding his education continued to be a problem. He took a year off after his freshman year to return to his job with Hull but continued his independent study. Upon turning 18, he received his inheritance from his late mother's estate and was able to finish college without further interruptions After graduation, he worked for a time in a large grape nursery. He was induced to return to Iowa State, where he was awarded his Master of Science degree in 1895.Niels Ebbesen Hansen Papers (South Dakota State Agricultural Heritage Museum) Career In 1895,South Dakota State College (now South Dakota State University), appointed Hansen to build its Horticultural Department.Niels Ebbesen Hansen‚ÄîPioneer Fruit Breeder (by A.F.

Hansen searched for new grasses, fruits and other plants throughout Europe and Asia. He brought these plants back to America to raise or crossbreed with American varieties to produce a stronger plant. He was the originator of many new fruits, among them the Hansen hybrid plums. He is credited with the discovery and introduction of hardy Cossack alfalfa, crested wheat grass and brome grass. He developed larger apricots and plums by crossing native varieties with those he brought from Asia.The Life and Work of Niels Ebbesen Hansen ( from To Plant the Prairies and the Plains 1941. by Mrs. H. J. Taylor) On an 1897 trip to Russia, he encountered the red-fleshed wild apple Malus niedzwetskyana and began two breeding programs based on this unusual fruit, one aimed at developing a cold-hardy cooking and eating apple, and the other aimed at developing ornamental crabapples. His efforts resulted in the Almata apple and the Hopa crabapple, among other varieties. When he discovered that the northwest apple breeder Albert Etter had beaten him to the punch in creating red-fleshed hybrids, he wrote to concede him priority with the words \\"Mr. Etter, you have defeated me in my destiny.\\" Fishman, R. \\"Albert Etter and the Pink-Fleshed Daughters of Surprise\\".

Beginnings In 1985 Bengt Stern started the institute Mullingstorp Education and Health, in Sweden south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast. It was he who designed and documented in detail the Meet Yourself process. Bengt was a qualified medical doctor.http://www.dn.se/sport/har-hittade-robert-gladjen-med-golfen-1.508837 In the seventies he ran a general practice in Sk√§rholmen outside Stockholm. He was also a writer, lecturer, society debater, course leader and course trainer. In addition to traditional medicine, Bengt Stern studied psychosomatic medicine, body therapy and also humanitarian and trans-personal psychology in Europe, India and the US. Bengt trained a large staff who from the beginning led the courses under his leadership. Gradually he turned more and more to writing and research. By the year 2011 about 5500 people had taken part in the Meet Yourself process.Dagens Nyheter, Monday 2 October 2000 Vill g√• bortom intellektet Many of those come from the top level of business life; sport and entertainment just to mention a few.Dagens Industri, 14 October 2000 G√• aldrig tillbaka ‚Äì Kontroversielle l√§karen Bengt Sterns r√•d till de utbr√§nda The courses The Meet Yourself Courses at Mullingstorp are based on an existential view of mankind and the world and that every event in one's life has a purpose and is therefore meaningful and as a consequence, every obstacle or cause of suffering such as relationship problems is a signal that one needs to increase one's degree of personal maturity or level of consciousness. Course structure The first step lasts for seven days and participants meet at 07:00 in the morning and finish around 22:00 at night. There is usually one therapist for every three or four participants as well as a course leader and doctor. The courses are intended to help people take stock of their lives and learn from misfortune in the belief that once this is achieved they will stop fighting against themselves and see life from a larger perspective. Furthermore, the program delineates the concept of \\"negative stress\\", which it claims is a result of emotional needs not being satisfied. In particular negative stress is caused when a person denies himself: *his need for intimacy and love *his ability to say \\"No!\\" *his need for rest *healthy food *meditation *sufficient exercise *further education *meaningful work By denying one's own needs, it is claimed, one avoids having to show \\"vulnerability\\" or \\"moral courage\\" that is to say standing up for what is \\"true\\" and \\"meaningful\\". Bengt maintains that these capabilities will remain beyond a person's reach until they dare to meet and explore their fear and mental pain. Bengt's view of childhood experiences and how they shape people's later lives In the book \\"Feeling Bad Is a Good Start\\", Bengt describes the ways in which childhood experiences shape a person's adult life in detail. Bengt believed that in order to make lasting changes in one's life one must search within oneself and without any reservation, keep in touch with one's inner and outer reality. He claimed that this happens when one works with one's early emotional memories. At the same time one activates the strength and courage needed to change one's life. The theory is that when one chooses to explore one's inner and outer conflicts instead of avoiding them, not only does one's negative stress decrease but also symptoms of mental or physical disease. Bengt's theory of intellect Bengt theorises that a person who strongly identifies with his intellect is controlled and has no possibility to reach beyond it and gain perspective on his life. Therefore, he cannot identify his emotional and/or physical needs, nor can he satisfy them. The controlled person identifies with his roles and patterns of behaviour. There are hundreds of different things that he can identify with, for example, his talents, occupation, routines, lack of self-confidence, rebellious side, disease, religion, hypocrisy, nationality, looks, his ideas, sexuality, work, title, family, circle of friends, diet, home, car, etc. Friends and family can, in Bengt's view, nearly always reveal things that a person identifies with better than he himself. The psychologist Carl Jung used the term \\"shadow\\" to summarise the behavioural traits and patterns of a person that he cannot see in himself. A person who does not understand his own emotional needs will not know who he is or what he really wants from his life. He is forced to continue to live alone or to remain in a malfunctioning love relationship, he may not be enjoying his work and he accepts that people treat him badly. Childcare Too many children have psychological problems, which can be attributed largely to parental influence. During the foetal period, birth and early childhood, children are strongly affected by the frame of mind of their parents. Our futures are shaped by experiences during this period. Mullingstorp's theories of disease There is a great difference between society's views on disease and Mullingstorp's views. Mullingstorp contrasts what they see as the treatments offered by established healthcare systems for example: *Sobril for anxiety *Cipramil to treat depression *Losec to treat ulcershttp://patient.info/medicine/omeprazole-to-reduce-stomach-acid-losec- mepradec-mezzopram *Voltaren to treat joint pain. *Radiation, chemotherapy and, in some cases, surgery, as the dominant forms of cancer treatment with their view that disease symptoms are existential signals that initially need to be interpreted and not reduced by external measures. Despite the fact that Mullingstorp courses do not focus on treating symptoms, but rather on deepening self-awareness they claim that participants \\"always experience a substantial reduction in their mental and physical symptoms during the courses\\". Mullingstorp holds the belief that with symptomatic treatment the patient's problems nearly always return in one or another form and that not until one has made a conscious effort to get rid of negative stress will the symptoms disappear more permanently. Research on Mullingstorp courses In 2009 a study was conducted by Lotta Fernros of the Karolinska Institutehttp://diss.kib.ki.se/2009/978-91-7409-356-8/ into the methods used by Mullingstorp. The study measured the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in the participants at the beginning of the course. On arrival, before the course, the participants completed three questionnaires. The first was SWEDQUAL, with 61 items for self-rating of HRQOL classified in 13 areas, e.g. cognition, physical functions, sleep, pain, relations and emotions. The second was Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence with 13 items divided into three areas: comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability. The third was about work, education, experience of alternative medicine, sick listing and medication. Comparisons were made with population data from Statistics Sweden, the National Insurance Office and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Six of the thirteen subscales of HRQOL showed very low starting values, which is unusual in a group with such a high level of education. Eight of the subscales of HRQOL showed clinically significant improvements in the study group (>9%, p<0.01), namely: general health (9%), emotional well-being (negative 45% and positive 26%), cognitive functioning (24%), sleep (15%), pain (10%), role limitations due to emotional health (22%) and family functioning (16%). Physical, partner and sexual functioning were normal in both groups. The study concluded that the Meet Yourself Process can improve cognitive and emotional function, which in turn increases motivation. The process has the potential to be used as a starting point in rehabilitation for working life, for people who are forced for health reasons to cope with a readjustment crisis and establish a foundation for a new orientation. Publications Bengt Stern published the following books: *Growing into Health ‚Äì about man's meeting with his inner reality (1985) *Meet Yourself Beyond all Sense (1990) *Feeling Bad is a Good Start (1994) Bengt Stern's last book, \\"Feeling Bad is a Good Start\\" is published in Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, German and English. The book \\"Feeling Bad is a Good Start\\", attempts to give a clear picture of the psyche of man ‚Äì why he reacts as he does and why he feels bad.Stern, Bengt, (1994), Feeling Bad is a Good Start, Promotion Publishing, 1994, The book also gives a background to the courses at Mullingstorp. It describes the most important exercises in the Meet Yourself process. The book gives a taste of man's inner world. It describes how deep negative patterns in the psyche can be healed. The book is also intended to work as an alarm clock and a source of facts for those who want to take the step to get around their inner defences and start \\"living life to the full\\". Controversy surrounding Mullingstorp Walter Heidkampf applied in March 2008 to one of Mullingstorp's courses and was refused because he is HIV-positive.http://www.qx.se/samhalle/8601/walter-fick- ratt-mot-mullingstorp Mullingstorp claimed that a negative HIV status was required to protect the other course participants.http://www.nt.se/norrkoping/artikel.aspx?articleid=4518488 Heidkampf sued Mullingstorp and was eventually awarded 10,000SEK in compensation. Mullingstorp was also required to pay the Swedish Disability Ombudsman 52,000SEK.

Gill has been described as one of the Fifty Key Thinkers of International Relations and it is noted that \\"confining his thought to any discipline or sub-field unfairly diminishes the breadth of his work.\\"Griffiths, Marti, Steven C. Roach and M. Scott Solomon (2009), Fifty Key Thinkers in International Relations, Second Edition. Routledge. . p. 178. His work has been translated into many languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese and Finnish. His 2003 book Power and Resistance in the New World Order won the Outstanding Academic Title Award of Choice, the journal of the American Library Association. Biography Gill was raised in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England and states that the British class system in which he grew up was one of the most important factors in shaping his political outlook: \\"This system helped forge a sense of injustice and resistance to illegitimate power that have been driving forces in much of my intellectual and political work.\\"Gill, Stephen (2003).

He attended City of Leeds School before leaving Yorkshire to enter higher education, studying a variety of subjects including English, French, Economics, Industrial Administration, Government and Politics and Education.Gill 2003, p. 3. Gill cites Stephen Burman (now of the University of Sussex) and John N. Gray as two of his main influences during his university education. While reading for a doctoral degree in Sociology at Birmingham University, Gill was encouraged by Burman \\"to study transnational class formations and to begin to think about world order in a more complex way than orthodox theorizations of International Relations seemed to allow.\\"Gill 2003, pp. 3‚Äì4. This perspective has remained a distinctive feature of Gill's research and he is noted for the breadth of his work, which is influenced by a wide variety of theoretical approaches.Griffiths et al., p. 178. While studying part-time for his doctorate at Birmingham, Gill also held a full-time position as a lecturer at Wolverhampton Polytechnic (now University), where he formed a close working partnership with David Law, developing a \\"sociological perspective\\" on Global Political Economy which would culminate in the publication of their book, The Global Political Economy: Perspectives, Problems and Policies, in 1988.Gill 2003, p. 5. Griffiths et al. note that, \\"uniquely for its time, [it] gave serious attention to the entire theoretical spectrum of the field, including variants of Marxism and game theory as well as making novel arguments about the structural power of capital.\\"Griffiths et al., p. 178. In 1990, Gill immigrated to Canada \\"as an intellectual refugee from Thatcherism\\" and took up a position as a professor in the Political Science department of York University, Toronto, where he worked with Robert W. Cox.Gill 2003, p. 8. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2003http://research.yorku.ca/publichome/aboutyrkres/FRSC/index.html and was awarded the title of Distinguished Research Professor in 2005.http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=4709 In 2003 he was elected Vice-President of the International Studies Association.http://www.yorku.ca/gradcmct/profiles/faculty/Gill.html For the 2009-2010 academic year, he was the Erkko Visiting Professor in Studies on Contemporary Society at the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki.http://www.stephengill.com/index.htm Research Gill is considered one of the leading Neo-Gramscian International Relations scholars, although his work adopts his own distinctive historical materialist approach as a means of explaining global power and the changing world order. His work draws on Gramscian concepts such as American hegemony (for the Gramscian definition, see Hegemony), cultural hegemony and historic blocs, organic intellectuals and state-civil society.Griffiths et al., p. 179. American Hegemony and the Trilateral Commission Gill's early work, American Hegemony and the Trilateral Commission (1991) introduced many of these concepts which were used to theorise and identify the global ruling class formations drawn from politics, the corporate world and civil society, and in particular the ideas of their leading thinkers (\\"organic intellectuals\\"). Gill showed how organisations such as the Trilateral Commission sought to develop a consensus among ruling class elements on how to extend the power of capital, to govern world capitalism, to defeat communism and to oppose and undermine state formations that refused integration into the capitalist world market. The book has been praised for its combination of theoretical and methodological innovation and described as a \\"classic study\\" of the changing structures of global power since 1945.Burnham, Peter, Karin Gilland Lutz, Wyn Grant and Zig Layton-Henry (2004), Research Methods in Politics. Palgrave. . p. 279. The book challenged the conventional wisdom of the 1980s, associated with Yale historian Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1988), which argued that US hegemony was in decline in the 1980s and would likely decline further in the 1990s. Gill argued that US hegemony was reasserted during the 1980s, paving the way for neoliberal capitalism to expand globally in the 1990s under US leadership. Gill argued that a key reason for this was a complex (\\"historical bloc\\") of liberal institutions, ideas and elites which was part of a highly developed US-led alliance structure that helped to politically cement the main capitalist states' strategies towards adversaries as well as promoting the globalisation of capitalism. A review by Gaddis Smith in Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Trilateral Commission's sister organisation the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that \\"the discussion is mercifully free of the polemical, conspiratorial assumptions behind many studies of this subject.\\"Smith, Gaddis (1990), \\"Book Review: American Hegemony and the Trilateral Commission\\", Foreign Affairs, Summer 1990. http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/45544/gaddis- smith/american-hegemony-and-the-trilateral-commission Gramsci, Historical Materialism and International Relations Gill's 1993 edited work, Gramsci, Historical Materialism and International Relations, which gathers together essays on Gramsci by authors including Gill, Cox, Kees van der Pijl and Giovanni Arrighi, is considered one of the key texts on Gramscian and Neo- Gramscian theory and has been credited with broadening the audience for Gramsci's work within the field of International Relations.Griffiths et al., p. 190. Power & Resistance in the New World Order and more recent work In his more recent work, Gill has introduced new concepts such as disciplinary neoliberalism, new constitutionalism and market civilizationGriffiths et al., p. 178. and has drawn significantly on Michel Foucault‚Äôs theories of panopticism and capillary power.Griffiths et al., p. 181. Gill‚Äôs concept of market civilization helps to explain the formation of social subjects in the era of neo-liberalism, based on a reading of how market values, market forces and disciplines, privatisation, and the commodification of life forms are becoming increasingly pervasive, working into the very micro-practices of everyday life.Griffiths et al., pp. 182‚Äì3. Gill‚Äôs collaboration with the noted feminist scholar Isabella Bakker in their edited work Power, Production and Social Reproduction: Human In/security in the Global Political Economy is an attempt to develop a radical re-conceptualisation of political economy. The authors state their aim \\"is to bring together theories and concepts from Feminist and Radical Political Economy and Critical International Studies, and to harness them to a more encompassing methodological and theoretical perspective with which to study some of the new conditions of existence in the global political economy. It seeks to provide a new approach based on an effort to synthesise the moments of power, production and social reproduction in patterns of intensified globalization.\\"Bakker, Isabella, and Stephen Gill (2003), Power, Production and Social Reproduction: Human In/security in the Global Political Economy. Macmillan-Palgrave. . p. 3. In a review for the journal Progress in Human Geography, critical geographer Helen Jarvis noted how the book identifies and explains \\"complex relationships simultaneously at work in global flows (of people and finance) and local practices (of production and social reproduction),\\" adding that \\"it moves beyond grand narratives of hegemonic neoliberalism, unraveling hidden circuits of inequality in the social reproduction of daily life.\\"Jarvis, Helen (2006), \\"Book Review: Power, Production and Social Reproduction Human In/security in the Global Political Economy\\", Progress in Human Geography, 30:4, pp. 535‚Äì537. http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/4/535 Major works * The Global Political Economy: Perspectives, Problems and Policies with David Law.

John Littleton, the youngest child of Harvey Littleton, grew up in the shadow of his father's accomplishments in Madison, Wisconsin, where he experienced first-hand the personalities and events of the early glass movement. Glass, however, was not John Littleton's first medium of choice when it came time for him to select a career. It was only after majoring in photography at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison that he began to create in glass. He soon formed a collaborative partnership with another art student, Kate Vogel, who had exchanged her study of two dimensional art for glass. The artists' earliest collaborations in glass were the bag forms for which they are well-known today. Since 2000 their work has included a series of arms and hands cast in amber-colored glass. Over the years the hands have held various objects, including river stones, large faceted glass \\"jewels\\", and colorful cast glass leaves. In recent years Littleton and Vogel have also become known for their series of functional glass and wrought iron side tables. Early life John Littleton is the son of glass artist Harvey Littleton and his wife, Bess Tamura Littleton. He was born in 1957 in Madison, Wisconsin, where his father was a professor of art at the University of Wisconsin. Known as the father of the Studio Glass Movement, Harvey Littleton had introduced glass as a medium for the studio artist in two workshops that he organized on the grounds the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962. That fall, Littleton began teaching glass in a garage at his rural Wisconsin home and later secured University of Wisconsin funding to rent and equip an off-campus glass department in Madison. Harvey Littleton soon gained significant exposure for his artwork in glass and became a self-described \\"evangelist\\" for the medium,Grasberg, Stuart (1997) Harvey K. Littleton from Artseen!, video tape, Grasberg/Littleton, 2001 lecturing about its potential for the studio artist throughout the Midwest and Northeastern United States. As a boy John Littleton grew up around glass art and his father's colleagues in glass, including Dale Chihuly, Fritz Dreisbach, Erwin Eisch, Robert C. Fritz and Marvin Lipofsky. When it came time to select a course of study in college, John Littleton, in a bid to establish his identity apart from that of his father, majored in photography with Cavalierre Ketchum (b. 1934) and did independent study in glass with David Willard.David Willard headed the glass program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison from 1977 to 1982. International Polymer Clay Association website. Accessed 9/01/09 He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science in Art from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.Who's Who in Contemporary Glass Art, Joachim Waldrich Verlag, Munich, 1993 Kate Vogel was born in 1956 in Cambridgeshire, England to David and Patricia Vogel. David Vogel, who studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an ROTC scholarship, was serving in the U.S. Army there. Vogel and his young family returned to the United States when Kate was about two years old. They settled in Madison, Wisconsin where David went to work for the family-owned Vogel Brothers Building Company. He served as president of the company, and, as of 2017, was Chairman of the Board.Vogel Brothers Building Company website. Accessed 4/25/17 As a college student at the University of Wisconsin, Kate Vogel initially studied two-dimensional art, specifically drawing and painting. In 1977 she was enrolled in a summer course at Santa Reperata Graphic Arts Center in Florence, Italy. While in Italy she took a trip to the Venetian island of Murano where she visited some of the glass factories.Hunter, Elizabeth, \\"Team Spirit: Kate Vogel and John Littleton are partners in art and life\\", NC Home, Business North Carolina, Charlotte, NC, February 1993 On the recommendation of a fellow student, Vogel enrolled in the University of Wisconsin's glass program under David Willard. She received the Bachelor of Science in Art in 1978. Vogel and Littleton met while both were in college. Their first collaboration in glass took place in 1979 at the Spruce Pine, North Carolina studio of Harvey Littleton, who had relocated there three years earlier, after his retirement from the University of Wisconsin. John Littleton and Kate Vogel moved to North Carolina in the summer of 1979, eventually settling in Bakersville, where they built their studio and hot shop. In North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains they found themselves in the midst of a growing community of glass artists, including Rick and Valerie Beck, Gary Beecham, Katherine and William Bernstein, Shane Fero, Rob Levin, Mark Peiser, Richard Ritter, Jeffrey M. Todd, Yaffa Sikorsky-Todd and Jan Williams. For Kate Vogel, the sense of community was \\"wonderful\\" because it not only allowed her to see what her peers were doing aesthetically, but also to consult with them on technical questions.Hunter, Elizabeth, \\"Exquisite Eye Candy: World Class Glass in the North Carolina Mountains\\", Blue Ridge Country, Volume VIII Number 4, 1995 pages 19-22 Blown glass works John Littleton/Kate Vogel This sculpture is typical of the artists' \\"Acrobag\\" forms Littleton and Vogel's first successful sculptures took the form of \\"Bags\\"; blown glass bubbles that were shaped to look like soft fabric bundles \\"tied\\" at the neck with a loop of glass and terminating in a flared ruff. The bags were quickly followed by two series of forms that had elements in common with them. \\"Handkerchiefs\\" took the form of soft inverted cones with flared, undulating lips; \\"Favors\\" featured an ovoid or lobed form with two flared rills of glass on either side, resembling a lump of candy twisted in colorful paper. At the beginning of their collaborative career Littleton and Vogel exploited the ability of glass to retain the appearance of its hot fluidity even after cooling into a solid. In a catalog statement for the first exhibition of their collaborative work the artists wrote, \\"With the bag, handkerchief and favor forms we try to freeze some of the molten quality of the glass.\\"Byrd, Joan Falconer, North Carolina Glass 80, Western Carolina University, 1980 page 18 It was the bags, however, that presented the most possibilities for variation and evolution. The artists' sense of play became more evident as the bags referred less to their inanimate prototypes than to biopomorphic forms. In 1982 the artists were showing large transparent bags in which smaller translucent bags rested.Byrd, Joan Falconer (curator) \\"North Carolina Glass '82: Invitational Exhibition\\" (catalog), Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 1982 (unpaginated) According to artist and writer Joan Falconer Byrd, the bags \\"gradually assumed the nature of seedpod and womb.\\"Byrd, Joan Falconer, \\"John Littleton/Kate Vogel: A Decade of Collaboration\\" (exhibition catalog), Maurine Littleton Gallery, Washington, DC 1990 (unpaginated) The \\"Shard\\" series of bags that Littleton and Vogel began showing in 1984Byrd, Joan Falconer (curator) \\"North Carolina Glass '84: Invitational Exhibition\\" (catalog), Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 1942 (unpaginated) got its start by accident. On their way to a glass art conference in New York, a bag piece that was traveling with them broke. As Vogel recalled, \\"We looked at the broken piece for three or four days in our hotel room and got interested in it.\\" Upon their return to the studio, they learned to cut and open the hot glass bubble; into these fragments they would nestle small glass bags. About this time they also began to sand blast and acid etch the exterior surfaces of the bags to produce a deceptively soft texture with a satiny sheen. By the end of the '80s the artists were creating \\"Bag Explosions,\\" in which small bags seemed to tumble and float from the jagged opening of a large bag. The sharply defined, polished edges of the \\"Shards\\" began to suggest flower forms to the artists, and so their \\"Flora\\" series began. Cutting open the hot bubble the collaborators produced blooms with long ray-like petals surrounding a delicate glass stamen. At first the stems were short and made of the same glass as the petals; later the stems became curving stalks of transparent, colorless glass. The \\"Flora\\" series ended in 1988. Cast glass works John Littleton/Kate Vogel This sculpture belongs to the artists' \\"Crystal\\" series of forms Although Littleton had cast a gloved hand in glass in 1979, it was not until 1989 that he and Vogel began to explore glass casting in earnest. The large, work-worn hands of an artist friend inspired one of their early sculptures; initially cast in plaster, the hands and arms, as well as the faces, of family members and friends, children and adults, appeared in subsequent works. Their \\"Crystal\\" series includes blocks of colorless crystal glass, faceted to look like large pieces of rock crystal; in the center of the transparent forms frosty white hands (which are actually hand-shaped voids in the glass) hold small rock crystals aloft. The artists left these crystalline forms in favor of cast cubes of crystal that entrap three-dimensional faces and hands. The human forms soon broke free of the cube, appearing in the round with the fine details of skin texture, wrinkles and hair preserved from the original plaster casting. These works appeared in colorless and purple tinted glass. During the 1990s the glass, tinted blue, mimicked \\"water\\" from which colorless glass faces and hands seemed to arise. In the brochure for the a twenty-year retrospective of the artists' work, Joan Byrd wrote of the dichotomy between the continuing series of Bags and the cast sculptures. In the blown pieces > ‚Ä¶the work is playful and seems effortless. The cast sculptures, on the other > hand, bear the weight of profound adult concerns. Primarily colorless or > monochromatic, these pieces are monumental in aspect.Byrd, Joan Falconer, > \\"Littleton/Vogel: Twenty Year Collaboration\\", (exhibition brochure) Western > Carolina University, 2000 (unpaginated) Work since 2000 John Littleton/Kate Vogel, Leaf Fan Littleton and Vogel continued to produce bags, adding their \\"Acrobags\\" and \\"Imago\\" series of works (both of which feature small bags balancing on top of a single large one) in the late 1990s to their continuing line of \\"Bag Explosions.\\" By mid-decade the artists' cast sculptures focused exclusively on hands and arms posed in the act of proffering an object. Earlier in the decade smooth stones, found by the artists on walks,Brendstrup, Dagmar, The Visible Man\\", Glasmuseum Ebeltoft, Ebeltoft, Denmark, 2003 page 24 were the objects of choice; these gave way to hot-worked glass spheres, discs and faceted glass \\"jewels\\" made by the artists.Duane Reed Gallery website, www.duanereedgallery.com/.../littletonvogel.html Accessed 8/28/09 After 2006 the artists created cast glass leaves SOFA Expo website, www.sofaexpo.com/.../maurine-littleton/index.htm Accessed 8/28/09 for the hands to uphold.

The tops of the tables, flat discs cast with the impressions of vines and leaves, were inspired by the artists' trip to Costa Rica. On a tour of the rain forest, high above the ground on a suspended walkway, Littleton and Vogel looked down on a \\"tangled web of plants [that] became radial patterns and spirals as the ferns and trees reached for the light.\\"Artists' statement, consulted 9/02/09 Teaching Littleton and Vogel taught at Penland School of Crafts, Penland, North Carolina in 1987 and 1993.

Flight 1602 taxied to Runway 24 (now assigned '23' designation), and the takeoff roll was commenced at 06:53:22. When the aircraft reached , the control column was moved aft to 8.4¬∞ to initiate rotation as the aircraft passed the mark of Runway 24; with left on the runway, the aircraft began to rotate. The pitch attitude stabilized briefly at approximately 9¬∞ nose-up, with an airspeed of . Because the 747 still had not lifted off the runway, the control column was moved further aft to 10¬∞, and the aircraft responded with a further pitch up to approximately 11¬∞; at this time, a tailstrike occurred. The aircraft was approximately at the mark and slightly left of the center-line. The control column was then relaxed slightly, to 9¬∞ aft. The pitch attitude stabilized in the 11¬∞ range for the next four seconds, and the tailstrike abated as a result. With approximately of runway remaining, the thrust levers were advanced to 92% and the EPRs increased to 1.60. With remaining, a second tailstrike took place. As the aircraft passed the end of the runway, the control column was 13.5¬∞ aft, pitch attitude was 11.9¬∞ nose-up, and airspeed was . The highest recorded nose-up pitch of 14.5¬∞ was recorded at one minute and two seconds after takeoff initiation after the aircraft passed the end of the runway at a speed of . The aircraft became airborne approximately beyond the paved surface and flew a distance of . The lower aft fuselage then struck an earthen berm supporting an instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna beyond the end of the runway, separating from the plane. The plane then headed forwards in a straight line for another , breaking into pieces and bursting into flames when it struck the ground. Rescue Over 60‚Äì80 firefighters and 20 pieces of apparatus from Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency responded to the call. It took nearly three hours to extinguish the post-crash fire. Investigation An investigation into the crash revealed that the flight crew had used the incorrect speeds and thrust setting during the take-off attempt, with incorrect take-off data being calculated when preparing the flight (incorrect V speed calculation, as the result of the crew re-using a lighter take-off weight of from the aircraft's previous take-off at Bradley, instead of the correct weight of . The official report blamed the company for serious non-conformances to flight and duty time, with no regulations or company rules governing maximum duty periods for loadmasters and ground engineers, resulting in increased potential for fatigue-induced errors. (French version) MK Airlines disputed the findings, citing the fact that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was too heavily damaged in the post- crash fire to yield any information.

Life and career Born on 29 May 1942 to a Puerto Rican family in the Bronx, Rock parlayed his role as celebrity hairdresser into a role center stage. After several appearances and performances on The Merv Griffin Show beginning in 1966, Rock's wild antics, which included throwing bananas into the audience, and outrageous personality brought him to the national stage when he began appearing regularly as a guest on The Tonight Show. Rock is generally considered to be one of the first disco artists to cross into the mainstream. In February 1975, Rock released Disco- Tex & His Sex-O-Lettes Review, an LP of disco songs and collaboration with producer Bob Crewe and featuring musician Jerry Corbetta of Sugarloaf. Two of the album's tracks, \\"Get Dancin'\\" and \\"I Wanna Dance Wit' Choo (Doo Dat Dance)\\", became hit singles in the United States and instant staples at burgeoning New York dance clubs including Studio 54. The two songs were also Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom. By the end of the 1970s, disco music was fully mainstream, and Rock appeared in the movie Saturday Night Fever as the DJ. After reinventing himself several times as \\"Monti Rock II\\", \\"Monti Rock IV\\", \\"Monti Rock V\\", and \\"Sir Monti Rock\\", Rock settled on just \\"Monti Rock\\".

It is native to South and East Asia (Bhutan, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). In Vietnam, the tree is considered Critically endangered. In English, C. parthenoxylon is known as Selasian wood, saffrol laurel, or Martaban camphor wood. It has the outdated heterotypic synonym Laurus porrecta (Roxb.). The species name parthenoxylon derives from parthenos xylon (), meaning \\"virgin wood\\". The common name in Spanish is alcanforero amarillo (\\"yellow camphor\\") and it is thought to be the tree known as (mreah prew phnom). Growth Trunk and bark The tree has gray to brown bark. Its leaves are glossy green ovals 7‚Äì10 cm long with a point at the end. Like many plants in the Lauraceae, the leaves give off a pleasant smell when crushed. The flowers appear in clusters and are green and very small. The fruits are blackish drupes. In Indonesia, the flowers of C. parthenoxylon symbolize love and connection between the living and the dead. Traditionally, in the Kudus Regency on the island of Java, the flowers were scattered on tombs by family members. Uses The aromatic bark of the plant is used for flavoring, not unlike many other Cinnamomum species. The tree is of special concern, as it is being harvested at a high rate to obtain safrole, a precursor to the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the flavorant and fragrance piperonal, and the psychoactive drug MDMA. Much of this illicit harvesting is happening in the Cardamom Mountains and Botum Sakor National Park in Cambodia at the moment. The documentary film \\"Forest of ecstasy\\" (Vanguard 2009) is investigating the issue on location. (Episode is not available. Date: February 2014)Documentary film: Forest of Ecstasy Adam Yamaguchi (reporter). Vanguard 2009. Hosted by Cambodian Information Center An extract from the bark has been shown in rats to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia.  Conservation efforts  In 2004, the Cambodian government classified C. parthenoxylon as a rare species and prohibited any logging of this tree. In addition, the production, import, and export of safrole rich oils has been illegal in Cambodia since 2007.

It has been at Handcross Park House, Handcross, since 1968 and merged with Brighton College in 2011. History The school was originally known as Wykeham Hall. It was founded in 1887 by Rev. William Henry Webb, at Wykeham Hall, Lee-on- Solent. It was taken over by his son Ernest Webb in 1903 and later moved to nearby Seafield Park.Wykeham Hall Seafield Park had been the name of a large Victorian mansion built in 1872 by Sir Henry Sykes on 83 acres of land at Hill Head. It was destroyed by fire in 1948. In 1888 the house and grounds were sold to the Rev.R.W Pain, and in 1890 Seafield Park was registered for scholastic purposes under Mr.Pain and the Rev. Courtney Spencer Foster. In 1903 ownership was transferred to William Hoare and the school was changed to an engineering establishment. In 1907 the property was purchased by W.L. Agnew, and in 1910 the school was converted back to a Boys Preparatory school with W.A.Rix M.A. as headmaster. After Rix had been declared bankrupt, the premises were leased to Ernest Webb who moved his school there from Wykeham Hall. In 1923 ownership was transferred to Ernest's wife, Minnie Louisa Webb. Wykeham Hall was bought by the Fleet Air Arm in 1917 for use as a naval air station. RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus) On the outbreak of World War II, when Seafield Park was taken over for the Fleet Air Arm, the school moved to Endsleigh House, Milton Abbott, near Tavistock, Devon. This house had been built in 1810 and had continued in use as the summer holiday home for successive Dukes of Bedford. It had been designed by Sir Jeffry Wyattville as a cottage orne¬¥ for John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. On the conclusion of the War the Admiralty retained Seafield Park for naval use and the Duke of Bedford re-possessed his country home. The school was then moved to Newells, Lower Beeding, Nr Horsham, Sussex.The house at Newells during World War II had been taken over by the Ministry of Defence and was the headquarters for a Canadian Division, prior to the Invasion of Normandy. Captain Peter Hope-Lang took over from Ernest Webb as Headmaster. The school badge was retained but the name of the school changed from Seafield Park to Newells. The school remained at Lower Beeding until 1968 when a disastrous fire destroyed most of the buildings. By necessity the school was then amalgamated with Desmoor preparatory school at Handcross Park. More details on the history and people involved at that time, including photo images, can be seen at the Newells website external link,Newells website with images of Seafield Park and Endsleigh. Today the school is known by the name of Handcross Park.Handcross Park School In 2011 the school became a part of Brighton College. Badge The badge in use when the school was at Newells, Lower Beeding continued to be used after the school moved and it had been renamed Handcross Park School. An image of this badge can be seen at the present school's website. The badge is a device comprising an heraldic style shield of gold on a blue background, over the motto, worded in Middle English, \\"Be Trewe\\".Middle English Dictionary, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, USA 1997, p. 1053 The badge had been varied in 1939 by putting three Cross potent in place of the three heraldic fylfot crosses which had previously been used.

Montana, is a Montana Supreme Court case, argued on September 2, 2009, and decided on December 31, 2009, that addressed the question of whether the state's constitution guaranteed terminally ill patients a right to lethal prescription medication from their physicians.Baxter v. State, 2009 MT 449, 224 P.3d 1211, 354 Mont. 234 (2009). The Montana Supreme Court sidestepped the question of if medical aid in dying is guaranteed under Montana State Constitution, but it instead ruled, on narrower grounds, that neither legal precedent nor the state's statute deem such assistance to be against public policy or illegal. Montana is one of nine states in which aid in dying is authorized. The others are California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington: it is authorized in the District of Columbia as well. Background of the case The original lawsuit was brought by four Montana physicians (Stephen Speckart, C. Paul Loehnen, Lar Autio, and George Risi, Jr., M.D.s), Compassion & Choices and Robert Baxter, a seventy-six-year- old truck driver from Billings, Montana, who was dying of lymphocytic leukemia. The plaintiffs asked the court to confirm a constitutional right \\"to receive and provide aid in dying\\".Original plaintiff's filing Baxter v Montana The state argued that \\"the Constitution confers no right to aid in ending one‚Äôs life.\\" Judge Dorothy McCarter, of Montana's First Judicial District Court, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on December 5, 2008, stating that the \\"constitutional rights of individual privacy and human dignity, taken together, encompass the right of a competent terminally-ill patient to die with dignity.\\" Baxter died that same day. The Montana Attorney General appealed the case to the state supreme court. Oral arguments were heard on September 2, 2009. Amicus briefs filed on behalf of those asking the court to grant the constitutional right to receive/provide aid in dying include human rights groups, women's rights groups, The American Medical Women's Association/American Medical Students Association, clergy, legal scholars, thirty-one Montana state legislators and bioethicists, among others. Among the groups filing amicus briefs on behalf of the state were the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of the Family Research Council, Americans United for Life, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, disability rights group Not Dead Yet, and the Catholic Medical Association. The Montana Medical Association issued a statement opposing physician-assisted suicide, but refused to file an amicus brief in the appeal. Verdict On Dec. 31, 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Baxter. Although they did not address the constitutional question, they ruled on narrower grounds saying that \\"nothing in Montana Supreme Court precedent or Montana statutes indicating that physician aid in dying is against public policy.\\"  After Baxter  Since the Montana Supreme Court chose only to rule on statutory grounds, groups opposed to medical aid in dying have since tried to overturn the decision at the legislature. Likewise proponents of aid in dying have sought to have the detailed provisions found in other states codified. In 2013, Montana Doctor Eric Kress, M.D. became the first physician to speak publicly about providing aid in dying for qualified patients who request the medication. And in 2015 Erwin Byrnes became the first patient to speak publicly about his plans to take the medication, saying ‚ÄúWe have to be kind of the driver of our own bus.‚Äù In 2015 The Journal of Palliative Medicine published Clinical Criteria for Physician Aid in Dying for doctors to use as guidance in states like Montana, where provisions are not detailed in statute.

The deepwater field (defined as water depth ,) was discovered in September 2009 and it is operated by BP. Described as a \\"giant\\" find, it is estimated to contain of oil in place. Although BP states it is too early to be sure of the size ‚Äì a \\"huge\\" field is usually considered to contain . It required the drilling of a deep well under of water, making it one of the deepest wells ever drilled at the time of discovery. Description Tiber comprises multiple Lower Tertiary petroleum reservoirs located in Keathley Canyon block 102 about southeast of Houston and south west of New Orleans. Tiber is only the 18th Lower Tertiary well to date, and drilling in these formations is in its infancy. The oil from Tiber is light crude, and early estimates of recoverable reserves are around 20‚Äì30% recovery, suggesting figures of around of reserves. Sources such as Bloomberg suggest caution, warning that the find is technically complex and potentially could take 5‚Äì6 years to produce oil or be lower yield (5‚Äì15%) based on \\"rates talked about\\" at nearby Kaskida Oil Field, BP's previous giant find (2006) away. The commercial prospects of the field have not yet been evaluated. Discovery BP acquired the Outer Continental Shelf lease of Keathley Canyon block 102 reference G25782, NOAA station 42872, on October 22, 2003, in Phase 2 of the Western Gulf of Mexico (WGOM/GOM) Sale 187. Lower Tertiary rock formations are some of the oldest and most technically challenging offshore rock formations currently drilled for oil, dating to between 23 and 66 million years ago. The plan of exploration was filed in June 2008. Tiber was initially drilled by Transocean's fifth- generation dynamic positioned semi-submersible oil rig, Deepwater Horizon, with exploratory drilling commencing around March 2009, slightly delayed from the planned date of September 2008. Much of the deeper gulf reserves are buried under salt accumulations thousands of feet thick, which present a problem for seismic exploration. BP had previously developed exploration techniques to bypass this difficulty. Oil was located at \\"multiple levels\\". The field was announced on September 2, 2009, and BP shares rose 3.7 percent on the news. With Tiber joining at least ten other successful Lower Tertiary explorations in the area, analysts viewed the announcement as a sign for optimism, and a harbinger of renewed interest in, and production from, the offshore Gulf of Mexico.  Exploration on hold  Following the April 2010 destruction of the Deepwater Horizon while drilling the Macondo well, and the resulting oil spill, all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might otherwise have been used for developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.

The network consisted of the following stations, all of which were purchased by Pathonic in 1979: *CFCM-TV Quebec City *CFER-TV Rimouski *CHLT-TV Sherbrooke *CHEM-TV Trois-Rivi√®res *CIMT-TV Rivi√®re-du-Loup All of these stations were owned by Pathonic with the exception of CIMT, which was, and still is, owned by T√©l√© Inter-Rives. However, Pathonic held a 45 percent stake in T√©l√© Inter-Rives. All of the stations in the Pathonic network were affiliated with TVA. However, these stations often aired programming substantially different from other TVA affiliates - even though T√©l√©- M√©tropole, owner of CFTM-TV, was a major minority shareholder. In those days, TVA, much like CTV at the time and Global in the early 2000s, did not have what could be considered a main network schedule. The differences between schedules were strong enough that CHLT was carried on nearly all cable systems in Montr√©al from the early 1980s onward; CHLT's over-the-air signal covers most of the Greater Montreal area. The closest parallel to this in English Canada was the now-defunct Baton Broadcast System (in operation during the 1990s), as most of its stations were also CTV affiliates. The network is believed to have been dissolved shortly after Pathonic Communications merged with T√©l√©-M√©tropole in 1990, creating the present-day TVA network and chain of stations.Decision CRTC 90-631, 1990-07-09 The sale unified the ownership of most of TVA's major affiliates (except outlets owned by Radio-Nord and T√©l√© Inter-Rives, the latter whose 45% share is now owned by TVA) and ultimately unified the network's schedule. Pathonic Communications also owned CKMI-TV, an English-language station in Quebec City which was affiliated with CBC Television (and which is now a Montreal-based Global owned and operated station).

ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS online schedules as of January 24, 2010. It was Obama's first State of the Union Address and his second speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, accompanied by Joe Biden, the Vice President of the United States. The theme for President Obama's speech was ‚ÄúRescue, Rebuild, Restore ‚Äì a New Foundation for Prosperity‚Äù. Among the topics that Obama covered in his speech were proposals for job creation and federal deficit reduction. Newly inaugurated Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell delivered the Republican response following the speech from the floor of the House of Delegates at the Virginia State Capitol in front of over 300 people. Legislative initiatives and policies The following items were mentioned by the President as potential policy changes, legislative initiatives, or goals coming out of the address: * Fees on the country's largest banks (to follow up on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)) * Giving $30 billion from recovered TARP money to community banks to extend credit to small businesses * Job creation ** Building clean energy facilities ** Giving rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient ** Slash tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas (giving those breaks to companies that create jobs in the U.S.) * Encourage American innovation (focus on clean energy) ** Building nuclear power plants ** Exploring off-shore areas for oil and gas ** Investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies ** Comprehensive energy and climate bill to make clean energy profitable * More exports of goods (goal: double exports in 5 years) ** Launch of a National Export Initiative * Invest in the skills and education of our people ** Renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ** Revitalize community colleges ** Ending taxpayer subsidies to banks for student loans ** $10,000 tax credit for families for four years of college ** Increase Pell Grants ** Only 10% of income to student loans ** All student loan debt forgiven after 20 years, or after 10 years if they choose a career in public service ** Cost cutting at colleges and universities * Middle Class ** Nearly double the child tax credit ** Giving access to a retirement account for every worker ** Expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg (retirement fund) ** Refinancing to make more mortgages affordable * Tackling childhood obesity (headed by the First Lady, Michelle Obama) * Health care reform * Deficit reduction ** Starting in 2011, freeze government spending for 3 years on discretionary programs (excluding national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) ** Eliminate programs that are unaffordable or don't work ** Extend middle-class tax cuts ** Bipartisan fiscal commission to provide solutions (created by Executive Order, if necessary) ** Restoring pay-as-you- go law * Require lobbyists to disclose every contact they make * Limits on contributions that lobbyists give to candidates * Reform for earmarks, publish them in a single location on the web * Crack down on violations of equal pay laws * Immigration reform * Repealing Don't ask, don't tell policy within the year to allow homosexuals to serve in the military openly * Treating the nation of Israel with respect Justice Alito's response During the address, Obama condemned the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, stating, \\"Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests ‚Äì including foreign corporations ‚Äì to spend without limit in our elections.\\" Justice Samuel Alito was seen frowning and mouthing the words \\"not true\\" when Obama criticized the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts later commented on the subject at the University of Alabama, saying, \\"The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court ‚Äì according to the requirements of protocol ‚Äì has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling.\\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0310/very_troubling_f90ec36f-c19d-4360-81c8-f72bdd227b3a.html Technical information Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan was chosen as the designated survivor and did not attend the address, in order to keep a presidential line of succession should a catastrophic event have wiped out the administration. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also out of the country at the time of the address for a conference in London regarding the country of Yemen and the upsurge in terrorist activity in that country. Republican response The television networks elected to broadcast a response to the State of the Union Address by Bob McDonnell who had been sworn in as the Governor of Virginia 11 days before. McDonnell sought to replicate the trappings State of the Union Address by giving a speech in the chamber of the Virginia House of Delegates with the audience filled with his supporters and included shots of McDonnell entering the chamber while shaking hands as he walking down the aisle. He also selected ten guests to stand behind him as he delivered the speech, including a member of the armed forces wearing his uniform that critics alleged to be a violation of military regulations. In addition, the use of House chamber for McDonnell's speech did not comply with House Rule 82. In his prepared text, McDonnell stated, \\"Today, the federal government is simply trying to do too much.\\" Scheduling Originally, the White House was considering two dates for the State of the Union Address: January 26 and February 2.Adalian, Josef (January 6, 2010), \\"White House Could Derail Lost Premiere Plans\\", The Wrap.

History  In 1995 high tech marketing pioneer Andy Cunningham, who had been instrumental to the success of companies such as Apple, Cisco, and HP, was inspired to bring artists and technologists together to explore and incubate art and ideas that would change the world. Five years later, Andy Cunningham, launched ZERO1 to encourage creativity at the intersection of art and technology and to produce a major festival celebrating this creative intersection. The organization convenes artists and technologists, presents their collaborative efforts, sponsors artistic initiatives and exhibits the resulting work to the public. ZERO1 is the producer of ZERO1 Biennial, a multi-disciplinary, multi-venue event of visual and performing arts, the moving image, public art and interactive digital media.  ZERO1 Biennial History  Established in 2006, the ZERO1 Biennial has presented the work of more than 650 artists from more than 60 countries; commissioned over 120 original works of art, attracted over 170,000 visitors from around the world, and contributed approximately $30 million in economic revenue to the region. The ZERO1 Biennial, distributed throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, is North America's most significant and comprehensive showcase of work at the nexus of art and technology. Through curated exhibitions, public art installations, performances, and speaker events, the ZERO1 Biennial presents work by a global community of innovative artists who are reshaping contemporary culture.  2012 ZERO1 Biennial - Seeking Silicon Valley  The 2012 Biennial invited more than 150 artists from over 13 countries to present works at the forefront of media art ‚Äì collaborating with local, regional, national and international cultural institutions and iconic Silicon Valley companies to showcase three months of exhibitions, events, and performances. The core Biennial exhibition, also entitled Seeking Silicon Valley, was collectively curated by five international curators and included 24 international artists from 11 different countries, including 18 original commissions. 51 Biennial projects were installed in public space, 28 of those public art projects were for (e)MERGE, the ZERO1 Street festival, that engaged 86 collaborating artists.  2010 ZERO1 Biennial - Build Your Own World  In September 2010 over 47,000 visitors engaged with over 100 artists, designers, engineers, filmmakers, musicians, architects and avant-garde creators from 21 countries, as they proved that art can be more than merely aesthetically pleasing, but rather a tool with which to Build Your Own World. Led by ZERO1 Artistic Director, Steve Dietz, in his third and final year with the Biennial, Assistant Curator Jaime Austin, and ZERO1's Executive Director Joel Slayton, the 2010 ZERO1 Biennial featured works by art and design luminaries David Rockwell and The Lab, Brody Condon, Natalie Jeremijenko, Rigo23, Todd Chandler, Blast Theory and many more. The 2010 Biennial also included a digital art collector's panel, Still Life with Banquet, the city's first zipline over a man-made marsh, a drive-in theater fashioned out of salvaged cars, and AbsoluteZERO an evening street fair of emerging artists.  Bay Lights  The Bay Lights is an iconic light sculpture celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Bay Bridge in San Francisco by artist Leo Villareal. The sculpture is 1.8 miles wide and 500 feet high incorporating 25,000 individually programmed LED lights driven by a complex set of algorithms and patterns in a dazzling display across the bridge's west span. ZERO1 was invited to be the fiscal sponsor, contracted with Illuminate the Arts, to provide fiscal stewardship for the world's largest light sculpture and currently the nation's largest public art project.  2008 ZERO1 Biennial - Global Festival of Art on the Edge  From June 4‚Äì8, 2008 over 25,000 attendees, visited 100 art installations, 25+ performances, workshops, and public talks by over 100 artists from more than a dozen countries at exhibitions held throughout downtown San Jose; students from seven continents participated in a global youth digital arts exhibition designed to enable them to examine critical issues, share their views, and take action; the biennial commissioned over 19 new works, of which three were the result of a FUSE: CADRE/Montalvo Artist Research Residency Initiative, and supported an additional 29 projects.  2006 ZERO1 Biennial - First ZERO1 Biennial in conjunction with ISEA 2006  The inaugural 2006 Biennial held in conjunction with the International Society for Electronic Arts brought over 20,000 people to San Jose for seven days of art and interactivity. It featured 250 art installations representing 40 countries. The 2006 Biennial yielded nearly 100 media stories including a full-page spread in the Sunday New York Times, and was recognized as North America's newest and largest digital arts biennial.  Programs   American Arts Incubator (AAI)  ZERO1 in partnership with the U.S. State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) launched a new media and mural arts program, American Arts Incubator. Inspired by the ‚Äúbusiness incubator‚Äù model made popular by Silicon Valley's technology and start-up companies, American Arts Incubator is a hybrid training lab, production workshop, and tool for public engagement. It showcases artists as engaged and innovative partners in addressing social issues, in addition to creating a cross-cultural exchange of ideas. The selected U.S. artists team up with youth and under served populations, through country-based partnerships, to inspire creative ideas for community engagement through art programs. American Arts Incubator awards micro-grants to community-driven digital media or mural arts projects proposed by artist teams who reside in each overseas community. In doing so, the program creates opportunities for innovation by translating creative practices into community-driven artworks and ongoing arts programming that will bolster local economies, influence public policy, and further social change.  ZERO1 Fellowship  The ZERO1 Fellowship program was developed as a platform for artistic experimentation that recognizes the artist as the ultimate provocateur, risk-taker, and untapped resource of innovation. Working in collaboration with partner companies, cultural institutions, and academic research centers, ZERO1 Fellows are asked to cultivate lines of artistic research and cultural production in response to a specific innovation challenge. ZERO1 Fellows participate in cross-sector collaboration and problem solving while leveraging emerging technology, resources and expertise provided by sponsors. The Fellowship network is further informed by ZERO1 exhibitions, talks, publishing, and special events that establish context and serve to inspire.  ZERO1 Garage  In 2012 ZERO1 launched the Garage to complement the Biennial as the next phase in the organization's evolution. The ZERO1 Garage was created as a platform where the principles of artistic creativity could be applied to real world innovation challenges. The Garage's unique design, by architect Chris Haas, received a 2013 Merit Award from the AIA San Francisco's Design Award Program. Part research lab, part exhibitions center, the ZERO1 Garage was both a physical space and a conceptual platform where exhibitions, artist talks, panels, and symposia could take place for the next three years.

WNOC airs local programming in addition to programs from EWTN Radio, and Ave Maria Radio. History Annunciation Radio began in 2006 as a venture by Toledo businessman and Deacon Michael Learned who, on February 3, 2008, launched a Sunday afternoon program on Toledo daytime talk station WTOD 1560 AM. It was sold by Cumulus Media to CSN Radio in March 2010 (which is now WWYC). The program briefly moved to Cumulus-owned WLQR (1470 AM) until the new station signed on on August 14, 2010. The construction permit was at first held by MCCR Inc. (Ministry for Catholic Charismatic Renewal.) While the new station was in its construction permit phase, a temporary working studio and office was set up at 2679 Brookford Drive in Toledo and a tower erected on Sugar Ridge Rd. near Bowling Green which is shared with WPFX. In June 2010, two months before the station began broadcasting, Tim Kusner joined the radio station's staff. He was responsible for obtaining underwriters and gradually moved into producing, announcing, traffic management, managing the station Facebook page, and co-hosting the Friday morning live program Annunciation Radio Presents.

He was born in North Fairhaven, MA (now Acushnet) in 1812.Library of Congress lists his date of birth as 1812, an article in the New York Times from 1888 says he was born in 1808 Career Nye went to China in 1831, where he worked for various companies in the East Indian and Chinese trade. In 1843 he opened the House of Nye, Parkin & Co. In 1851 the firm name changed its name to Nye Brothers & Co. and operated until 1856. In this time period, it was also known as Bull, Nye, & Co. due to the brief involvement of Isaac Bull. Nye Brothers suffered a collapse in 1856 after over-investing during a down market. Family Gideon Nye, known as Gideon Nye, Jr., was a 7th generation descendant of Benjamin Nye, the founder of the Nye family, who settled in Sandwich, Mass., in 1637. He was an eldest child. His father, Gideon Nye, was born in 1786 and died in 1875. His mother, Sylvia S. Hathaway, was born in 1790, and died in 1883. Mr Nye was married in 1846, to Mary E. Washburn, who died in New York in 1870. Their only child was a daughter, born in Paris, France in 1846, Ellen E. Washburn. She died in Brooklyn, NY, in 1860.  Residence in Canton  Nye was a merchant in China for over fifty years and the American Vice Consul at Canton (now Guangzhou) for the last ten years of his life. He was a scholarly man with a reputation for integrity, active as a Vice President of the Medical Missionary Society, and as a corresponding member of the American Geographical Society. He was known as one of the oldest foreign residents of Canton, having spent 55 years in that city since his arrival in 1831. He died in the city on January25, 1888 and afterwards \\"the flags of the consulates, custom house and foreign ships in port were at half mast two days in token of public esteem and sorrow.\\"  Art collection  Nye purchased a large collection of valuable paintings in England between 18451850, which were exhibited in New York. Attempts were made to keep his collection intact, but it was dispersed to locations such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The paintings were considered important American artistic treasures of the time. Books and writings on the Opium Wars Nye published many books and pamphlets as an eye witness to the events which led up to the First Opium War, based on his acquaintance with both Chinese people and foreigners living in China.

Initially the postponement was for one year, but the Act was renewed annually until the electoral cycle was resumed in 1919 following the cessation of hostilities. Background Elections to local authorities in the United Kingdom were held annually in either April or November. In August 1914 war broke out, although this did not initially effect the municipal elections which were duly held in November 1914 and April 1915. A coalition government was formed in May 1915, and in June it was announced that the cabinet intended to introduce legislation to both extend the life of Parliament by a year to 1917, and also to postpone the November 1915 borough elections. The postponement of elections would also mean that local authorities would not need to compile new electoral registers. The Elections and Registration Bill was duly introduced to the Commons only 22 July. The bill passed all stages in both houses rapidly, and received the royal assent on 29 July. Provisions The Act was a short document containing only four sections. *Section 1 provided that the.. > \\"next statutory elections of county and borough councillors, district > councillors, guardians, and parish councillors, shall be postponed for a > year, and the term of office of the existing councillors and guardians shall > accordingly be extended by one year.'\\" Elections were no longer to be required to fill casual vacancies occurring in the membership of local councils and boards. Instead a vacant seat was to \\"be filled by means of the choice by the council or board of a person\\"... and \\"a councillor or guardian so chosen shall hold office in the same manner in all respects as if he had been elected to fill the vacancy\\". *Section 2 exempted the Common Council of the City of London from the Act. *Section 3 provided that the parliamentary and local government register of electors in force at the time of the passing of the Act, should remain in force until 31 December 1916. *Section 4 dealt with the application of the Act to Scotland and Ireland. Renewal With the continuation of the war until November 1918, the provisions of the 1915 legislation had to be renewed on three occasions by the Parliament and Local Elections Acts of 1916, 1917 and the Parliament and Local Elections (No. 2) Act, 1917.6&7 Geo.5.

The original design was by John Palmer, but minor alterations were later made by John Pinch. The Georgian terrace includes numbers 1 to 7, which have been converted into flats known as Cumberland House, and numbers 8 to 18 consecutively. Each has five storeys (basement, ground floor, piano nobile, second floor and attic) and the central portion has 6 Ionic pilasters. There is a green area in front of the crescent that was originally a formal garden for the residents, surrounded by railings. A small circular building in the corner of the gardens is the old watchman's hut, and is also Grade II* listed. History Richard Bowsher's Development Bowsher's plans for the Norfolk Crescent development. In March 1792 a solicitor named Richard Bowsher took a lease on of land next to the river Avon at what was then the western edge of the city of Bath.Land lease, Bath Record Office BC153/41/2 The lease stipulated houses of similar style and quality to those being erected in the nearby New King Street should be built on the land. As with other Bath developers, Bowsher's sub-leased plots of ground to craftsmen, on the condition that they would build houses on them, which would subsequently be let out to wealthy families. Several streets were planned with over 100 houses, the centrepiece being a crescent called Norfolk Place (later changed to Norfolk Crescent). The architect John Palmer was engaged to designed a facade for the buildings. However, in early 1793 a financial crisis, caused by the Bath Bank crash, brought disaster. Some of the builders went bankrupt and others were reluctant to take on new projects. None of Bowsher's houses were complete, but he had to continue paying rent for the land. Nevertheless, he survived the crash and in the 19th century the development was scaled down to a reduced plan with two main streets, Norfolk Crescent and Nelson Place, and the short Nile Street linking to the Upper Bristol Road to the north.Indenture for proposed pleasure gardens (10 December 1807), Bath Record Office BC153/37/14 These streets were named after Admiral Nelson, his home county (Norfolk) and his most famous victory to date (the Battle of the Nile, since the name was chosen before the Battle of Trafalgar was fought in 1805). The proposed streets in front of the crescent were abandoned and instead the area was made into a formal garden for the residents of Norfolk Crescent and Nelson Place, with each house paying ¬£2.2 annual rent for their upkeep. At the corner of the railed gardens, where Norfolk Crescent, Nile Street, Great Stanhope Street and Nelson Place meet, a watchman's hut was built. The watchman's hut was built to a classical design inspired by the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The renewed scheme also saw a new architect, John Pinch, making some minor alterations to the design. Even after the reduction in scale the work progressed slowly. The houses in Norfolk Crescent were gradually completed and occupied, but the last house was not finished until 1822 - thirty years after it had been planned.Rate books for 1810-1835, Bath Record Office The houses in Nile Street and in Bowsher's part of Great Stanhope Street were built between 1810 and 1820, but the houses in Nelson Place were not started until later. Nos. 1 and 2 were built as large houses (matching Norfolk Crescent) and the others were smaller, cheaper houses designed by Pinch but even using these houses it was not possible to complete the row. Thus, Bowsher's development was largely complete by the 1830s, albeit in a reduced form compared with the original plan. Palmer's Design Palmer's design for the facade of Norfolk Crescent. John Palmer's plan for Norfolk Crescent had nineteen three bay houses (No. 16 Great Stanhope Street and Nos. 1-18 Norfolk Crescent) in an arc with a radius of 420 ft. As was common with late 18th century Bath houses, the mansard roof with dormer windows was dispensed with, the facade instead stretching all the way up to the top of the houses, with a parapet above the attic windows. The two end houses were to have four Ionic pilasters on the main facade. The five central bays of the terrace were to have matching pilasters and a pediment in place of the attic windows. Nelson Place was to have a matching facade, but with a slightly longer terrace containing twenty-three houses. Pinch's Alterations At some point in the 19th century the design was altered, probably by John Pinch. The pediment was moved to be above the attic storey, so that the attics of the central houses were not deprived of light. Palmer's plan had a carved tympanum in the pediment, but this was never made, probably due to a lack of funds. Pinch also added balconies with wrought iron railings on the piano nobile (first floor) of all the houses. The iron lamp holders over the entrances to Nos. 7 and 14 are also likely to be Pinch's work. Norfolk Crescent and the watchman's box. Construction Construction work on the houses in Norfolk Crescent (at the time still known as Norfolk Place) began in 1792 when builders first took leases on the various plots. However the building work soon stopped due to the financial crisis. When construction work started again in the 19th century the market was much slower and the houses were completed gradually, when there was money available. For instance in 1817 Nos. 1-9, No. 14 and Nos. 16-18 were complete, but the intermediate houses were still not finished. No. 11, the last house to be completed, was finished in 1822. From the 1830s porch extensions were added on to the front of many Georgian houses in Bath, but this would have affected the visual balance of the crescent's facade, so it could not be done on Norfolk Crescent. However the owners of the two end houses (No. 16 Great Stanhope Street and No. 18 Norfolk Crescent), which had their entrances on the north and south ends of the crescent, did built full-height porch extensions on these houses without affecting the facade. Bombing and reconstruction In 1942 during the Second World War an incendiary bomb landed near the crescent and the north end was gutted by fire. It was not repaired until 20 years later in the 1960s, when Nos. 1-7 were rebuilt with the same facade as the original. The mid-19th century porch extension to the end house was omitted in the reconstruction. Behind the facade, the reconstructed houses are a block of flats, not a replica of the original Georgian building.

Periodontal disease is a disease affecting the tissue surrounding the teeth. This causes the gums and the teeth to separate making spaces that become infected. The immune system tries to fight the toxins breaking down the bone and tissue connecting to the teeth to the gums. The teeth will have to be removed. This is an advance stage of gum disease that has multiple definitions. Adult periodontitis affects less than 10 to 15% of the population in industrialized countries, mainly adults around the ages of 50 to 60. The disease is now declining world-wide. Prevalence of periodontal diseases in adults Many studies look at the prevalence of ‚Äúadvanced periodontitis‚Äù, but have differing definitions of this term. Generally though, severe forms of periodontitis do not seem to affect more than 15% of the population of industrialized countries. The proportion of such subjects increases with age and seems to peak between 50 and 60 years. A later decline in prevalence may be due to tooth loss. There are a number of methodological concerns with prevalence studies, particularly 1) the ability of partial recording to reflect full-mouth conditions and 2) the use of the Community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) recording system. The performance of a partial recording system is affected by the actual prevalence of periodontal disease in the population in question. The less frequent the disease, the more difficult it becomes for a partial recording system to detect it and thus may lead to greater underestimation of the disease prevalence. A full-mouth examination remains the best method of accurately assessing the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in a population. The use of the CPITN system for epidemiological purposes has flaws, which are grounded in a number of historical truths. At the time the system was designed, the initiation of periodontal disease was thought to develop from a continuum from an inflammation-free state to gingivitis, to calculus deposition and pocket formation and then to progressive disease. Treatment concepts were based on the concept of pocket depths being the most critical criterion for surgical versus non-surgical treatments. This index was also designed to screen large populations to determine treatment needs and formulate preventive strategies, not to describe the prevalence and severity of periodontal diseases. Albandar (1999) reported on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). This was derived from a large nationally representative, stratified, multistage probability sample in the USA comprising 9689 subjects. Pockets > 5mm were found in 7.6% of non-Hispanic white subjects, 18.4% of non-Hispanic black subjects and 14.4% in Mexican Americans; a total of 8.9% of all subjects had pockets > 5mm. Attachment loss > 5mm was found in 19.9% of non-Hispanic white subjects, 27.9% of non-Hispanic black subjects and 28.3% of Mexican Americans; a total of 19.9% of all subjects had attachment loss > 5mm. This suggests that severe periodontitis in not uniformly distributed among various races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. Hugoson (1998) examined three random samples of 600, 597 and 584 subjects in 1973, 1983 and 1993 respectively. These subjects were aged 20‚Äì70 years. The severity of disease was divided into five groups, with group 5 having the most severe disease. There was an apparent increase from 1% to 2% to 3% over the three study periods, which may have been due to an increase of dentate subjects in the older age groups. Susin 2004 examined a representative sample of 853 dentate individuals in Brazil who were selected by a multistage probability sampling method. They had a full-mouth clinical examination of six sites per tooth and answered a structured written questionnaire. Seventy-nine percent (79%) and 52% of the subjects and 36% and 16% of the teeth per subject had CAL >5 and >7mm, respectively. Oliver 1998 Bourgeois 2007 found that the prevalence of deep pockets (> 5mm) is low (10.21%) in a cross-sectional study. Baelum 1996 recalculated their previous data from Kenyan and Chinese populations to conform to the methods of examination and data presentation utilized in six other surveys. They did not find that the data supported the traditional generalization that prevalence and severity of periodontitis is markedly increased in African and Asian populations. Incidence of periodontitis Like measurements of prevalence of periodontitis, the measurement of incidence will vary depending upon the case definition of the disease. Often ‚Äúincidence‚Äù refers to new sites that meet the definition of periodontitis, even if they occur within a person that already has other diseased sites. Beck 1997 found that past disease predicted subsequent CAL, although not usually at the same site. Also, persons with greater attachment loss at baseline were more likely to lose teeth over the next 5 years. Beck 1997 ‚Äì looked at incidence density such that the numerator was attachment loss greater or equal to 3mm while the denominator was the time at risk for each site. The incident density for all subjects was 0.0017 per site per month. In other words, if 1000 sites were followed for one month, 1.7 sites would lose 3mm or greater attachment. In one year, 20.6 sites would be expected to show this degree of loss. \\\\- blacks has twice the incidence density of whites; males > females. Gilbert 2005 describes a prospective study of persons in Florida > 45 years old. In-person interviews and examinations were conducted at baseline and 48 months. The study size was 560 persons and at the 48-month examination, 22% of persons and 1.8% of teeth had attachment loss incidence. Early onset periodontitis Albandar 2002 examined 690 school attendees aged 12‚Äì25 years. They found that 2.3% had generalized EOP and 4.2% had localized EOP. This total of 6.5% contrasted with 1.8% for Nigeria, 3.1‚Äì3.7% for Brazil, 6.8% in India and 8% in Sudan. The prevalence in Caucasian populations is in the 0.1% to 0.2% range and may indicate that subjects originating from the sub-Saharan countries of Africa may be at higher risk of developing EOP. Tinoco 1997 examined 7843 children between the ages of 12 to 19 in Brazil with strict clinical and radiographic criteria. A 0.3% prevalence of localized juvenile periodontitis was found, with different subpopulations exhibiting a range between 0.1% to 1.1%. This study found that LJP was highly associated with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Lopez 2001 examined 9,162 high school children for clinical attachment loss in 6 sites of first and second molars and incisors. Overall, CAL >1mm was seen in 69.2% of the students; >2mm in 16% of the students and >3mm in 4.5%. They noted that while the distribution of CAL was markedly skewed, it followed a continuum of disease severity. No sharp distinction exists between periodontal health and disease among Chilean adolescents. Levin 2006 studied 642 young Israeli army recruits (562 men and 80 women) ‚Äì clinical periodontal examination of four first molars and eight incisors and radiographs were completed. Aggressive periodontitis was found in 5.9% of the subjects (4.3% localized and 1.6% generalized). This was significantly associated with current smoking and ethnic origin (North African). Eres 2009 examined 3,056 students between the ages of 13 to 19 years at public schools in Turkey. Their mouths were coded according to the recommendations of the CPITN (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs). Among the 3,056 students screened, 170 were scheduled for further examination and 18 were diagnosed with localized aggressive periodontitis. Thus, the prevalence of LAgP was 0.6% with a female to male ratio of 1.25:1. Tooth loss Baelum 1997 reported on the incidence of tooth loss over 10 years among adult and elderly Chinese and looked at some predictive factors. There were 440 subjects, 8 of which were edentulous at baseline and 31 who lost all remaining teeth during the study period. Of the 401 who remained dentate, the incidence of tooth loss ranged from 45% in the 20- to 29-year-old group to 96% in the 60 years plus group. He found that the best baseline predictors of tooth loss of all remaining teeth was that at least one tooth had attachment loss greater or equal to 7mm. As in other studies, a major portion of the total number of teeth lost was accounted for by a small group of persons. In this study, dental caries was the dominant reason for tooth loss.

They can be perceived as modified Dutch auction. This method has been used since 1992 when it debuted as an experiment of the U.S. Treasury for all auctions of 2-year and 5-year notes. There is only one main difference between the multiple-price system and the single-price system. In the multiple-price format, the ranking of the desired yield and the amount stated by the competitive bidders is from the lowest to the highest yield and the amounts awarded are at the individual yields submitted by the participants. In the single-price format - all bids accepted by the Treasury are awarded at the same interest rate which is the highest yield of accepted competitive bids. History The format of selling U.S. Treasuries by auctions was adopted in 1929 and it has evolved since then. In the beginning of the 1970s, in addition of the multiple-price auctions, were introduced auctions of coupon-bearing securities. Even before 1992, many economists and researchers had proposed the single-price system. One of them is Milton Friedman according to whom the multiple-price auction had 2 main deficiencies: *If a bidder pays more than the stop-out price, he/she is penalized even though his willingness to pay might be higher. This restriction led to pre-discussions between the other auction participants in order to assess the probable bids. Accordingly, the submission of bids resulted in a shift downwards from the \\"true\\" market demand curve. *Restricted number of participants coming from the \\"close to the market\\" rule which led to unnecessary high underwriting spread for the Treasury. The change from multiple-price auctions to single-price auctions was promoted mainly by the Treasury's interest in stimulating the competitive bidding and liquid secondary markets. U.S. Treasury Auctions United States Treasury security auctions are conducted using the single-price auction method. In a single- price auction, all successful competitive bidders and all noncompetitive bidders are awarded securities at the price equivalent to the highest rate or yield of accepted competitive tenders. These securities include: *Treasury bills *Treasury notes *Treasury bonds *Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) Treasury Action process The Treasury auctions have 2 main features that explain how they work: *Non-competitive bids vs. competitive bids Non- competitive bids are the ones submitted by individuals and smaller institutions to purchase debt issues (governmental securities) on the primary market. Non-competitive bidders are guaranteed to win the auction i.e. to receive securities, but there is no guarantee on the price or yield received. They leave the auction in any cases with the amount they requested. However, they have a limit on the amount they can purchase in the framework of one auction. The maximum amount is $5 million per auction and the minimum vary depending on the type of Treasuries. For example, the minimum for a Treasury Bill is $10,000. Competitive bids can be submitted only by larger financial institutions (e.g. institutional investors) because there is a condition of minimum $5 million worth. In addition, the bidders are limited to 35% of the amount of offering per auction. Each participant has the right to submit one or more competitive bids, as they have to specify a minimum yield at which the bidder is prepared to buy a specified quantity of notes or the lowest discount rate at which the bidder is ready to buy a certain amount of bills. Non- competitive bids are usually opened until 12:00 (ET) while competitive ones ‚Äì until 13:00. *Single-price system All securities have the same interest rate which is determined by the lowest accepted competitive bid. And the way the interest rate is conducted is by the single-price system. After the Treasury closes the bids, the quantity of non-competitive bids is subtracted from the whole amount of securities offered and then, it starts accepting the competitive bids until the amount of securities offered is exhausted. Example The Treasury declares it will auction off $24 billion in securities of 2-year notes. First, we have to take into account the non- competitive bids ‚Äì which in this case are $2 billion. We know that all of the non-competitive bidders get what they are asking for. Therefore, the amount of securities left for the competitive bids is $22 billion worth. The competitive participants declare the lowest interest rate they are willing to receive and the amount of Treasuries they want: *Company 1: bids $7 billion with interest rate of 2.70 = $7 billion awarded *Company 2: bids $5 billion with interest rate of 2.75 = $5 billion awarded *Company 3: bids $6 billion with interest rate of 2.80 = $6 billion awarded *Company 4: bids $8 billion with interest rate of 2.85 = $4 billion awarded *Company 5: bids $6 billion with interest rate of 2.85 = $0 billion awarded Outcome: Since there are $22 billion of Treasuries, the bid of company 1 is accepted at their interest rate of 2.70, then the bids of company 2 and 3 are also accepted. Until we get to company 4 when there are only $4 billion of securities left - only $4 billion awarded instead of the $8 billion asked. There is nothing left for company 5. Since the last company to receive any securities is company 4 - the interest rate they declared, becomes the standard one for all Treasuries. Then, company 1,2,3 also obtain 2.85% as interest rate, as well as the non-competitive bidders.

Built in 1910 it was destroyed during World War II. The General Secretariat of Ukraine () was the autonomous Ukrainian executive government of the Russian Republic from June 28, 1917 to January 22, 1918. For most of its existence it was headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The secretariat was created after the Central Council of Ukraine accepted a proposal of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. According to the Encyclopedia of Ukraine, this event took place five days after the proclamation of the 1st Universal of the Central Council of Ukraine, however many contemporary historians have other opinions in that regard. The initial composition of the secretariat included eight General Secretaries (ministers) and one General Scribe (secretary). Background The first document of the government that identified its program was the Declaration of the General Secretariat. It was publicly announced at the plenum meeting of the Central Council of Ukraine on June 26 by the head of the Secretariat, Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The document together with the First Universal caused a lot of worrying in Petrograd as precedent to possible separation. It only took several days when the official delegation led by Aleksandr Kerensky together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tereschenko and Minister of Post and Telegraph Tsereteli arrived to Kiev. The Russian delegation and the members of the General Secretariat along with Mykhailo Hrushevsky after some discussion worked out the new Universal of the UPR and the Declaration of the Russian Provisional Government that were announced on July 3. On July 13, 1917 the Russian Provisional Government recognized the Secretariat as the highest executive power in Ukraine and requested from the Tsentralna Rada that the members of the secretariat ought to be confirmed by the Russian Government. The Secretariat would be expanded to include members of minorities and would be responsible to the Rada. By the end of July 1917 five more secretariats were added due to the Provisional Government request. In course of the next round of negotiations now in Petrograd the Ukrainian delegation was requesting the acceptance of the General Secretariat Statute by the Russian Provisional Government, which was approved by the Central Rada and proclaimed as the first Constitution. Those Negotiations ended with that the Prime Minister of Russia, Aleksandr Kerensky, signed the Instruction for the General Secretariat of the Provisional Government in Ukraine, a legal normative act, that was binding the local government of Ukraine for its execution. According to the Instruction, the General Secretariat had limited powers, but was acknowledged as the highest institution of the Provisional Government in Ukraine and authority of which stretched upon five gubernias Volyn, Podillia, Poltava, Kiev, and partially Chernihiv. The Russian Provisional Government requested the Secretariat to be reduced to nine members and that all of the members will be appointed by the Russian Government by the recommendations of the Tsentralna Rada. The secretariats of the military affairs, food and legal affairs, and postmaster- telegraph were to be canceled. After some negotiations the Tsentralna Rada yielded to the request on August 7, followed by the resignation of Volodymyr Vynnychenko as a sign of protest and pressure from the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party. Mala Rada has accepted his resignation on August 13. Dmytro Doroshenko (UPSF), a former head commissioner of the Provisional Government of Galicia and Bucovina, was offered to create a new Secretariat. The Mala Rada has confirmed his selections already on August 14, but soon Doroshenko resigned on August 18. Finally Vynnychenko came back to accomplish the task and on September 1 the Provisional Government confirmed the new administration. Until January 1918 the Secretariat conducted 63 meetings where were reviewed 430 various issues of political, economical, military, and diplomatic character. In October 1917, the Russian Provisional Government stopped the transfer of funds to the General Secretariat and expressed its intentions to file a claim against its members for separatism and the participation in the All-Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The Russian government requested an appearance of Volodymyr Vynnychenko personally for the full explanation in that regard. On October 21 at the meeting of the Secretariat was reviewed the issue of sending delegation to Petrograd headed by Vynnychenko together with Steshenko and Zarubin for the negotiations with the Provisional Government in reference to the political situation in Ukraine. That intention was ceased due to the illegal change of power in the country with the utilization of the military force. After the October Revolution of 1917 the Secretariat was forced to expanded once again to supplement the ministries of the collapsed Provisional Government. After the proclamation of the Third Universal on November 20, 1917 number of secretaries have resigned. Later on January 6, 1918 Symon Petliura was commissioned to take the charge of the Haydamaka Kish. By start of 1918 the Secretariat has changed dramatically. On January 25 (dated January 22), 1918 the General Secretariat was transformed into the Council of People's Ministers after the declaration of the IV Universal and independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Location  Initially the government was located at the same location as the Central Rada at 54 vulytsia Volodymyrska (Volodymyr Street), however Volodymyr Vynnychenko knew that it could not last for long as it only had two rooms assigned in the mediocre building. The government soon moved to 38 Khreshchatyk Street in the building of former hotel \\"Savvoi\\" which has not preserved after World War II. Currently at that location exists the building of the Kiev City Council (36 Khreshchatyk Street). The first government budget was adopted on August 30, 1917. The proposition to move to the building of \\"Savvoi\\" hotel came up on the session of the Central Rada on September 13, 1917 with intentions to lease the place from the city government, under jurisdiction of which the hotel was. The General Secretariat was allowed to move to \\"Savvoi\\" sometime in late September 1917, however that place was decided to be a temporary due to the physical conditions of the building. Vynnychenko tried to acquire the Mariyinsky Palace from the \\"Worker's and Soldier's Deputies\\", but unsuccessfully. Other interests were posed by the hotel \\"Frantsiya\\" (corner of Khreshchatyk and Prorizna vulytsia) and the Popov building (22 vulytsia Hrushevskoho). Today in place of the former hotel is located the building of Ministry of Energy and Fuel. The General Secretariat was finally able to move to the former Palace of Governor-General in Kiev at 40 vulytsia Instytutska (Institute Street) in January 1918, while the hotel \\"Savvoi\\" after being restored was also secured after the Ukrainian government. Later the Palace has suffered greatly during the military actions in 1920 and was replaced by other building changing the address to 20/8 Institute Street.

In clinical and neuroscientific literature it is often defined as a lack of motivation to generate distinct cognitive processes needed to attend to a problem or issue. The physics term inertia is to emphasize the rigidity and resistance to change in the method of cognitive processing that has been in use for a significant amount of time. Commonly confused with belief perseverance, cognitive inertia is the perseverance of how one interprets information, not the perseverance of the belief itself. Cognitive inertia has been causally implicated in disregard of impending threat to one's health or environment, enduring political values and deficits in task switching. Interest in the phenomenon was largely taken up by economic and industrial psychologists to explain resistance to change in brand loyalty, group brainstorming and business strategies. In the clinical setting cognitive inertia has been used as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases, depression and anxiety. Critics have stated that the term oversimplifies resistant thought processes and suggest a more integrative approach that involves motivation, emotion and developmental factors.  History and methods   Early history  The idea of cognitive inertia has its roots in philosophical epistemology. Early allusions to reduction of cognitive inertia can be found in the Socratic dialogues written by Plato. Socrates builds his argument by using the detractor's beliefs as the premise to his argument's conclusions. In doing so, Socrates reveals the detractor's fallacy of thought inducing the detractor to change their mind or face the reality that their thought processes are in contradiction. Ways to combat persistence of cognitive style is also seen in Aristotle's syllogistic method which employs logical consistency of the premises to convince an individual of the conclusion's validity. In the beginning of the twentieth century, two of the earliest experimental psychologists, M√ºller and Pilzecker, defined perseveration of thought to be \\"the tendency of ideas, after once having entered consciousness, to rise freely again in consciousness\\". M√ºller described perseveration by illustrating his own inability to inhibit old cognitive strategies with a syllable switching task, while his wife easily switched from one strategy to the next. One of the earliest personality researchers, W. Lankes, more broadly defined perseveration as \\"being confined to the cognitive side\\" and possibly \\"counteracted by strong will\\". These early ideas of perseveration were the precursor to how the term cognitive inertia would be used to study certain symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, rumination and depression.  Cognitive psychology  Originally proposed by William J. McGuire in 1960, the theory of cognitive inertia was built upon emergent theories in social psychology and cognitive psychology that centered around cognitive consistency, including Fritz Heider's balance theory and Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance. McGuire used the term cognitive inertia to account for an initial resistance to change how an idea was processed after new information, that conflicted with the idea, had been acquired. In McGuire's initial study involving cognitive inertia, participants gave their opinions of how probable they believed a variety of topics to be. A week later they came back to read messages that related to the topics they had given their opinions on. The messages were presented as factual and were targeted to change the participants' belief in how probable the topics were. Immediately after reading the messages, and one week later, the participants were again assessed on how probable they believed the topics to be. Discomforted by the inconsistency of the related information from the messages and their initial ratings on the topics, McGuire believed the participants would be motivated to shift their probability ratings to be more consistent with the factual messages. However, the participants' opinions did not immediately shift toward the information presented in the messages. Instead, a shift towards consistency of thought on the information from the messages and topics grew stronger as time passed, often referred to as \\"seepage\\" of information. The lack of change was reasoned to be due to a persistence in the individual's existing thought processes which inhibited their ability to properly re-evaluate their initial opinion, or as McGuire called it, cognitive inertia.  Probabilistic model  Although cognitive inertia was related to many of the consistency theories at the time of its conception, McGuire used a unique method of probability theory and logic to support his hypotheses on change and persistence in cognition. Utilizing a syllogistic framework, McGuire proposed that if three issues (a, b and c) were so interrelated that an individual's opinion were in complete support of issues a and b then it would follow their opinion on issue c would be supported as a logical conclusion. Furthermore, McGuire proposed if an individual's belief in the probability (p) of the supporting issues (a or b) was changed, then not only would the issue (c) explicitly stated change, but a related implicit issue (d) could be changed as well. More formally: > the required change (\\\\Delta) on c necessary for maintaining logical > consistency among the opinions is \\\\Deltap(c) = \\\\Deltap(a & b) which, > assuming that a and b are independent events i.e., that p(a & b) = p(a) p(b) > becomes \\\\Deltap(c) = \\\\Deltap(a) p(b) + \\\\Deltap(a) p(b) + \\\\Deltap(a) p(b) > where p(a) and p(b) refer to the initial opinions, before the communication > induced changes. This formula was used by McGuire to show that the effect of a persuasive message on a related, but unmentioned, topic (d) took time to sink in. The assumption was that topic d was predicated on issues a and b, similar to issue c, so if the individual agreed with issue c then so too should they agree with issue d. However, in McGuire's initial study immediate measurement on issue d, after agreement on issues a, b and c, had only shifted half the amount that would be expected to be logically consistent. Follow-up a week later showed that shift in opinion on issue d had shifted enough to be logically consistent with issues a, b, and c, which not only supported the theory of cognitive consistency, but also the initial hurdle of cognitive inertia. The model was based on probability to account for the idea that individuals do not necessarily assume every issue is 100% likely to happen, but instead there is a likelihood of an issue occurring and the individual's opinion on that likelihood will rest on the likelihood of other interrelated issues.  Examples   Public health   Historical  Group (cognitive) inertia, how a subset of individuals view and process an issue, can have detrimental effects on how emergent and existing issues are handled. In an effort to describe the almost lackadaisical attitude from a large majority of U.S. citizens toward the insurgence of the Spanish flu in 1918, historian Tom Dicke has proposed that cognitive inertia explains why many individuals did not take the flu seriously. At the time most U.S. citizens were familiar with the seasonal flu and viewed it as an irritation that was often easy to treat, infected few and passed quickly with few complications and hardly ever a death. However, this way of thinking about the flu was detrimental to the need for preparation, prevention and treatment of the Spanish flu, due to its quick spread and virulent form, until it was much too late and it became one of the most deadly pandemics in history.  Contemporary  In the more modern period, there is an emerging position that anthropogenic climate change denial is a kind of cognitive inertia. Despite the evidence provided by scientific discovery, there are still those ‚Äì including nations ‚Äì who deny its incidence in favor of existing patterns of development.  Geography  To better understand how individuals store and integrate new knowledge with existing knowledge, Friedman and Brown tested participants on where they believed countries and cities to be located latitudinally and then, after giving them the correct information, tested them again on different cities and countries. The majority of participants were able to use the correct information to update their cognitive understanding of geographical locations and place the new locations closer to their correct latitudinal location, which supported the idea that new knowledge not only affects the direct information but also related information. However, there was a small effect of cognitive inertia as some areas were unaffected by the correct information, which the researchers suggested was due to a lack of knowledge linkage in the correct information and new locations presented.  Group membership   Politics  The persistence of political group membership and ideology is suggested to be due to the inertia of how the individual has perceived the grouping of ideas over time. The individual may accept that something counter to their perspective is true, but it may not be enough to tip the balance of how they process the entirety of the subject. Governmental organizations can often be resistant or glacially slow to change along with social and technological transformation. Even when evidence of malfunction is clear this form of institutional inertia can persist. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama has asserted that humans imbue intrinsic value on the rules they enact and follow, especially in the larger societal institutions that create order and stability. Despite rapid social change and increasing institutional problems, the value placed on an institution and its rules can mask how well an institution is functioning as well as how that institution could be improved. The inability to change an institutional mindset is supported by the theory of punctuated equilibrium, long periods of deleterious governmental policies punctuated by moments of civil unrest. After decades of economic decline the United Kingdom's referendum to leave to EU was seen as an example of the dramatic movement after a long period of governmental inertia.  Interpersonal roles  The unwavering views of the roles people play in our lives has been suggested as a form of cognitive inertia. When asked how they would feel about a classmate marrying their mother or father undergraduate many students said they would be unable to view their classmate in the role of step-father/mother. Some students went so far as to say that the hypothetical relationship felt like incest. Role inertia has also been implicated in marriage and likelihood of divorce. Research on couples who co-habitat together before marriage shows they are more likely to get divorced than those who do not. The effect is most seen in a subset of couples who co-habit without first being transparent about future expectations of marriage. Over time cognitive role inertia takes over and the couple marries without fully processing the decision, often with one or both of the partners not fully committed to the idea. The lack of deliberative processing of existing problems and levels of commitment in the relationship can lead to increased stress, arguments, dissatisfaction and divorce.  In business  Cognitive inertia is regularly referenced in business and management to refer to consumers' continued use of products, a lack of novel ideas in group brainstorming sessions and lack of change in competitive strategies.  Brand loyalty  Gaining and retaining new customers is an essential part of whether a business succeeds early on. To assess a service, product or likelihood of customer retention many companies will invite their customers to complete satisfaction surveys immediately after the purchase of a product or service. However, unless the satisfaction survey is completed immediately after the point of purchase the customer response is often based on an existing mindset about the company, not the actual quality of experience. Unless the product or service is extremely negative or positive cognitive inertia related to how the customer feels about the company will not be inhibited, even when the product or service is substandard. These satisfaction surveys can lack the information businesses need to improve a service or product that will allow them to survive against the competition.  Brainstorming  Cognitive inertia plays a role in why a lack of ideas are generated during group brainstorming sessions as individuals in a group will often follow an idea trajectory, in which they continue to narrow in on ideas based on the very first idea proposed in the brainstorming session. This idea trajectory actually inhibits the creation of new ideas that was central to the initial formation of the group. In an effort to combat cognitive inertia in group brainstorming, researchers had business students either use a single dialogue or multiple dialogue approach to brainstorming. In the single dialogue version the business students all listed their ideas and created a dialogue around the list, whereas in the multi-dialogue version ideas were placed in subgroups that individuals could choose to enter and talk about and then freely move to another subgroup. The multi-dialogue approach was able to combat cognitive inertia by allowing different ideas to simultaneously be generated in sub-groups and each time an individual switched to a different sub-group they had to change how they were processing the ideas which lead to more novel and high-quality ideas.  Competitive strategies  Adapting cognitive strategies to changing business climates is often integral to whether or not a business succeeds or fails during times of economic stress. In the late 1980s in the UK, real estate agents' cognitive competitive strategies did not shift with signs of an increasingly depressed real estate market, despite their ability to acknowledge the signs of decline. This cognitive inertia at the individual and corporate level has been proposed as reasons to why companies do not adopt new strategies to combat ever increasing decline in the business or take advantage of potential. General Mills' continued operation of mills long after they were no longer necessary is an example of when companies refuse to change the mindset of how the company should operate. More famously, cognitive inertia in upper management at Polaroid was proposed to be one of the main contributing factors for why competitive strategy for the company was not updated. Management strongly held that consumers wanted high quality physical copies of their photos and that was where the company would make their money. Despite Polaroid's large research and development into the digital market, their inability to refocus their strategy to hardware sales instead of film eventually led to their collapse. Scenario planning has been one suggestion to combat cognitive inertia when it comes to making strategic decisions to improve business. Individuals come up with different strategies and outline how the scenario could play out taking into account different ways it could go. Scenario planning allows for diverse ideas to be heard as well as the breadth of each scenario, which can help combat relying on existing methods and thinking alternatives are unrealistic.  Management  In a recent review of company archetypes that lead to corporate failure, Habersang, K√ºberling, Reihlen, and Seckler defined \\"the laggard\\" as one who rests on the laurels of the company, believing past success and recognition will shield them from failure. Instead of adapting to changes in the market, \\"the laggard\\" assumes that the same strategies that won the company success in the past will do the same in the future. This lag in changing how they think about the company can lead to rigidity in company identity, like Polaroid, conflict in adapting when the sales plummet and resource rigidity. In the case of Kodak, instead of reallocating money to a new product or service strategy, they cut production costs and imitation of competitors both leading to poorer quality product and eventually bankruptcy. A review of 27 firms integrating the use of big data analytics found cognitive inertia to hamper the widespread implementation, with managers from sectors that did not focus on digital technology seeing the change as unnecessary and cost prohibitive. Managers with high cognitive flexibility that can change the type of cognitive processing based on the situation at hand are often the most successful in solving novel problems and keeping up with changing circumstances. Interestingly, shift in mental models (disrupting cognitive inertia) during a company crisis are frequently at the lower group level with leaders coming to a consensus with the rest of the workforce in how to process and deal with the crisis, instead of vice versa. It is proposed that leaders can be blinded by their authority and too easily disregard those at the front-line of the problem causing them to reject remunerative ideas.  Applications   Therapy  An inability to change how one thinks about a situation has been implicated as one of the causes of depression. Rumination, or the perseverance of negative thoughts, is often correlated with severity of depression and anxiety. Individuals with high levels of rumination test low on scales of cognitive flexibility and have trouble shifting how they think about a problem or issue even when presented with facts that counter their thinking process. In a review paper that outlined strategies that are effective for combating depression, the Socratic method was suggested to overcome cognitive inertia. By presenting the patient's incoherent beliefs close together and evaluating with the patient their thought processes behind those beliefs, the therapist is able to help them understand things from a different perspective.  Clinical diagnostics  In nosological literature relating to the symptom or disorder of apathy, clinicians have used cognitive inertia as one of the three main criteria for diagnosis. The description of cognitive inertia differs from its use in cognitive and industrial psychology in that lack of motivation plays a key role. As a clinical diagnostic criterion, Thant and Yager described it as \\"impaired abilities to elaborate and sustain goals and plans of actions, to shift mental sets, and to use working memory\\". This definition of apathy is frequently applied to onset of apathy due to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease but has also been applied to individuals who have gone through extreme trauma or abuse.  Neural anatomy and correlates   Cortical  Cognitive inertia has been linked to decreased use of executive function, primarily in the prefrontal cortex, which aids in flexibility of cognitive processes when switching tasks. Delayed response on the implicit associations task (IAT) and Stroop task have been related to an inability to combat cognitive inertia, as participants struggle to switch from one cognitive rule to the next to get the questions right. Before taking part in an electronic brainstorming session participants were primed with pictures that motivated achievement to combat cognitive inertia. In the achievement primed condition subjects were able to produce more novel high quality ideas and had more use of right frontal cortical areas which were related to decision making and creativity. Cognitive inertia is commonly used as one of the key dimensions of clinical apathy, described as a lack of motivation to elaborate plans for goal-directed behavior or automated processing. Parkinson's patients whose apathy was measured using the cognitive inertia dimension showed less executive function control than Parkinson's patients without apathy, possibly suggesting more damage to the frontal cortex. Additionally, more damage to the basal ganglia in Parkinson's, Huntington's and other neurodegenerative disorders have been found with patients exhibiting cognitive inertia in relation to apathy when compared to those who do not exhibit apathy. Patients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have shown reduced motivation to change cognitive strategies and how they view situations, similar to individuals who experience apathy and cognitive inertia after severe or long-term trauma.  Functional connectivity  Nursing home patients who suffer from dementia have been found to have larger reductions in functional brain connectivity primarily in the corpus callosum, important for communication between hemispheres. Cognitive inertia in neurodegenerative patients has also been associated with a decrease in the connection of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal area with subcortical areas including the anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia. Both findings are suggested to decrease motivation to change one's thought processes or create new goal-directed behavior.  Alternative theories  Some researchers have refuted the cognitive perspective of cognitive inertia and suggest a more holistic approach that takes into account the motivations, emotions and attitudes that fortify the existing frame of reference.  Alternative paradigms   Motivated reasoning  The theory of motivated reasoning is proposed to be driven by the individual's motivation to think a certain way, often to avoid thinking negatively about oneself. The individual's own cognitive and emotional biases are commonly used to justify a thought, belief or behavior. Unlike cognitive inertia where an individual's orientation in processing information remains unchanged either due to new information not being fully absorbed or being blocked by a cognitive bias, motivated reasoning may actually change the orientation or keep it the same depending on whether that orientation benefits the individual. In an extensive online study participant opinions were acquired after two readings about various political issues to assess the role of cognitive inertia. The participants gave their opinion after the first reading and were then assigned a second reading with new information. After being assigned to read more information on the issue that either confirmed or disconfirmed their initial opinion the majority of participants' opinions did not change. When asked about the information in the second reading those who did not change their opinion evaluated the information that supported their initial opinion as stronger than information that disconfirmed their initial opinion. The persistence in how the participants viewed the incoming information was based on their motivation to be correct in their initial opinion, not the persistence of an existing cognitive perspective.  Socio-cognitive inflexibility  From a social psychology perspective individuals are continually forming and shaping beliefs and attitudes about the world around them based on interaction with others. What information the individual attends to is based on prior experience and knowledge of the world. Cognitive inertia is seen not just as a malfunction in updating how information is being processed but that the assumptions about the world and how it works can impede cognitive flexibility. The persistence of the idea of the nuclear family has been proposed as a socio-cognitive inertia. Despite the changing trends in family structure including multi-generational, single-parent, blended and same-sex parent families, the normative idea of a family has centered around the mid-twentieth century idea of a nuclear family (i.e. mother, father, and children). Various social influences are proposed to maintain the inertia of this viewpoint, including media portrayals, persistence of working-class gender roles, unchanged domestic roles despite working mothers and familial pressure to conform. The phenomenon of cognitive inertia in brainstorming groups has been argued to be due to other psychological effects such as fear of disagreeing with an authority figure in the group, fear of new ideas being rejected and the majority of speech being attributed to the minority of group members. Internet-based brainstorming groups have been found to produce more ideas of high-quality because it overcomes the problem of speaking up and fear of idea rejection.

The station serves the Sandusky and Port Clinton areas as a repeater of originating sration WNOC 89.7 mHz licensed to Bowling Green and serving the Toledo area. The station began as a construction permit in start up phase in 2009 by Port Clinton Knights of Columbus Home Association. The new licensee is Our Lady of Guadelupe Radio Inc (dba:Annunciation Radio). WHRQ's transmitter is located near Castalia with its main WNOC studio and office located at 3662 Rugby Drive in Toledo. WHRQ is the third full-time Catholic station in the Toledo Diocese and the second of Annunciation Radio's regional network. Annunciation Radio began in 2006 as a venture by Toledo businessman and Deacon Michael Learned who, on February 3, 2008, launched a Sunday afternoon program on WTOD 1560 AM until WNOC made its initial sign-on on August 14, 2010. Annunciation Radio's beginnings as a weekly Sunday afternoon program on Toledo's daytime talk station, the former WTOD (now CSN International-owned WWYC) 1560 AM, later moved to Cumulus-owned WLQR 1470 AM in Toledo, up until the time WNOC made its initial sign-on during the Feast of the Assumption on the weekend of August 14 and 15 of 2010. WHRQ is a sister station and repeater of WNOC 89.7 FM in Bowling Green, and serving the metropolitan Toledo area. In June, 2010, 2 months before the station began broadcasting, Tim Kusner joined the Radio Station Staff. He was responsible for obtaining underwriters and gradually moved into producing, announcing, traffic management, managing the station Facebook page, and Co-Hosting the Friday Morning live program \\"Annunciation Radio Presents.\\" WNOC serves the Bowling Green and Toledo areas while sister station WHRQ in Sandusky at 88.1 FM made it on-air debut on Monday April 25, 2011. The Annunciation Radio audiostream commenced on its website on August 26, 2010. Upon its initial sign-on (which took place at 3:30pm on Monday April 25, 2011), WHRQ became the third Catholic station within the Toledo Diocese to begin broadcasting. WHRQ along with sister stations WFOT, WSHB and originating station WNOC airs programming from EWTN Global Catholic Radio. In June 2013, Annunciation Radio purchased WFOT 89.5 FM licensed in Lexington and serving the Mansfield area. WFOT, on the air since 2007 was originally part of Columbus-based St. Gabriel Radio as a near-simulcast of WVSG (AM). WFOT programming transitioned from St Gabriel Radio to Annunciation Radio on July 11, 2013 at 3:00 pm local time. In the fall of 2013, the construction permit of WSHB 90.9 FM in Willard was purchased by Annunciation Radio from the Mansfield Christian School and made its sign-on during Christmas Day on December 25, 2013. WJTA 88.9 FM licensed to Glandorf and transmitting from Leipsic is owned by a separate entity that serves Findlay, Ottawa, Lima, Napoleon, Defiance and Paulding which complements both the WNOC and WHRQ signals. Since all three stations carry nearly all of the EWTN radio schedule, EWTN programming is easily accessed on a car radio along the I-75, Ohio State Route 15 and U.S. Route 6 corridors in northwestern and north central Ohio by all three stations in their respective areas and frequencies.

A subsequent notice linked to an example of micropoetry by another user, which was clearly lyrical but didn't appear to fit any preexistent form such as haiku or tanka. While short poems are most associated with the haiku, the emergence of microblogging sites in the 21st century created a modern venue for epigrammatic verse.

Micropoetry often shares the quality of found poetry, where poetic style is discovered in text not intended to be poetic. A famous early example of this was Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin's Twitter feed, which comedian Conan O'Brien and actor William Shatner spoofed as poetry. Examples In order to fit the most meaning into few characters, micropoetry often breaks traditional rules of grammar and lexicon, as in this example: > evrywhr:i c mmnts crl'd back like lips > frm ancnt teeth;evrywhr:i C the bones,their shapes ntwined in2 the > flowrs of gd's infnite > spirogrphMichael Fergusson, Twitter poetry, November 12, 2008 The form is also often characterized by spontaneous and rapid production and dissemination, as in the King's Place Twitter contest, judged by Yoko Ono.

It is developed by Beautiful Game Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows on September 11, 2009 making it the first Championship Manager game to be released before Football Manager since Championship Manager 2007. The Mac OS X version of the game shipped from Virtual Programming on November 23, 2009. Features Due to the game's two year development time, developers Beautiful Game Studios implemented several new features to football management games. 3D match engine The match engine underwent a radical overhaul with the result being a fully animated match engine with over 500 individual player animations. There are seven different camera angles, replays and the ability to record and re-watch matches. This helps the Manager to see how their decisions and instructions manifest themselves on the playing field in 3D. Set Piece creator This feature enables managers to create Set Pieces. You can call upon all the individual strengths of your squad members to produce the perfectly executed free kick. The creator splits the set piece into a number of stages so managers can fine tune every crucial step from passing direction, cross/chips and runs to coordinating your defence when a corner is taken against you. Scouting network Scouting for new players is now a more accessible feature. Managers are given a world map view of their knowledge of different countries and expenditure allocation. Scouts report back the up-and- coming star players from around the world allowing you to dedicate more of your time to other areas. Drill training Managers can now set up drills to see how their players match up against each other ‚Äì shooting, crossing, practice matches and much more all shown in the three-dimensional match engine. CM Season Live A first in the football management genre, CM Season Live is a monthly downloadable update which brings you all the latest events from the world of football, dropping you into the action at key defining moments in the season. Mail and media A huge range of messaging in the game enables you to have far greater access to information and news from within the game's world of football. Broadcasting real media references, the latest CM news system delivers in a wide variety of ways. The user gets all the information and news that's relevant to their game in order to maximise their potential as a manager. Dynamic display window A dynamically updated display window brings a real world likeness to the user. Managers will be able to look out on the latest league tables, fixtures, top goal scorers and more from their in-game football world. Coverage from every part of the globe will appear throughout the game on every screen. ProZone ProZone continues to evolve to enable users to access highly detailed, post-match analysis on their players. With full stats on their own team and the opposition, the manager has the complete picture of personal and team performances to aid their decisions. Development Originally named Championship Manager 2009, the game was renamed due to a change in release dates. Championship Manager 2010 is the first game in the series to have a 2-year development time. This is due to recent versions in the series not being critically successful for publisher Eidos Interactive, who admitted that the franchise had lost direction in recent years and that the publisher was determined to make the game a \\"strong alternative\\" to Sega's Football Manager. The release date was originally April 2009 but was pushed back to September 11, 2009 to polish the game properly. A Beta version PC Demo was released for players to test and report back problems to the developers in time for the final version release.

Eurogamer gave the game an 8 out of 10 stating \\"For the first time, the Championship Manager series is a viable alternative to Football Manager... CM10's attempts to innovate must be applauded, and the majority of its refinements are either solid additions or real winners. MSN UK also applauded the game and concluded \\"Once you get stuck into a season, it is fearsomely addictive, and all aspects of football management are present and correct, if not necessarily developed to Football Manager‚Äôs level of sophistication. It is a lot more forgiving than Football Manager... If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, it‚Äôs worth considering for the first time in years.\\" Now Gamer gave the game a 7.3 out of 10 concluding \\"Championship Manager 2010 ‚Äì particularly with its impressive highlights engine ‚Äì manages to land a good few solid punches, and gives the Sports Interactive team something to genuinely mull over. For Championship Manager is now in the finest shape it‚Äôs been in for half a decade, and there are more solid foundations for next year‚Äôs edition to be built on.\\" UK news site The Guardian gave the game 4 out 5 stars and concluded that \\"If you seek a straight-down-the-line football management experience that tests your powers of wheeler-dealing, man-management, tactics and training, then you will find Championship Manager thoroughly satisfying...At last, the beloved old stager has found a hint of its previous form.\\" Sales General Manager of Beautiful Game Studios, Roy Meredith, claimed the 'Pay What You Want' promotion for Championship Manager 2010 had \\"exceeded\\" expectations. In its first two weeks of release the game held the No.1 spot in the PC Retail charts. In its third week the game slipped to No. 2. After over four months of being sold, the game dropped out of the Top 10 Retail PC Games chart.

Structures vary in size and scale from the Zion Lodge to road culverts and curbs, nearly all of which were designed using native materials and regional construction techniques in an adapted version of the National Park Service Rustic style. A number of the larger structures were designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, while many of the smaller structures were designed or coordinated with the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs. The bulk of the historic structures date to the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the structures of the 1930s were built using Civilian Conservation Corps labor. The version of the National Park Service Rustic style that was adopted at Zion was less extreme in its rustic character than that employed at other parks. Compared with the Bryce Canyon Lodge, the Zion Park Lodge used smaller elements of timber and stonework, and employed milled lumber in place of rough log elements. This reflected the more settled character of the Zion area, which retained farms and irrigation systems at the time the first visitor facilities were built. Many of Zion's historical structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), either as individual structures or as contributing structures in a historic district. They represent an unusually homogeneous series of buildings for a national park, sharing details of composition, scale and materials. They have collectively been described as some the best work in the National Park Service Rustic style. (The NRHP-listed structures are also listed in alphabetical order in National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park.) The park also preserves remnants of early Mormon settlement in Zion Canyon, which began in 1862. Two irrigation canals and a cable draw works remain. Utah Parks Company Zion Nature Center - Zion Inn *The Zion Lodge was designed in the rustic style by Underwood in 1924 as the centerpiece of Zion's visitor facilities. A 1966 fire destroyed the facility. A temporary lodge was reconstructed in 1992 to more fully resemble Underwood's Lodge. *The Zion Lodge Historic District comprises a large group of historic lodgings and support facilities surrounding the Zion Lodge, most of which were designed by Underwood. The district's National Register of Historic Places reference is 82001718. *The Zion Nature Center- Zion Inn was designed by Underwood for the Utah Parks Company as a cafeteria, gift shop and office for the tourist cabins surrounding it. The inn was built in 1934 in the National Park Service Rustic style and was used by the Utah Parks Company until 1972, when the Park Service remodeled it for use as a nature center. The structure features rubblestone pilasters at each corner with a \\"framing out\\" style infill. The roof is framed in log. The Zion Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It was recently restored to the original Underwood exterior design. The Nature Center was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003719. Transportation and infrastructure *The Floor of the Valley Road follows the North Fork of the Virgin River through Zion Canyon. The nine-mile road was planned by the National Park Service to blend with the landscape while highlighting the canyon's features for motorists. The earliest portions were built in 1916, but the bulk of the present road and associated structures were built in the 1930s as a Depression-era public works project. Historic American Engineering Record drawing, Cable Creek Bridge *The Cable Creek Bridge is on the Floor of the Valley Road. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its integrity as an example of the National Park Service Rustic style of design. The single-span sandstone-faced concrete bridge was designed by the Western Office of Design and Construction of the National Park Service, and was built in 1932 with Civilian Conservation Corps labor. The bridge was listed on the NRHP on February 16, 1996, with reference number 96000053, and is a contributing structure on the Floor of the Valley Road. *The Zion-Mount Carmel Highway was built to link Zion with Grand Canyon National Park. Completed in 1930, the road features a tunnel in the wall of Pine Creek Canyon. The road enables visitors to do a loop tour of Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument. *The East Entrance Checking Station was built in 1935 by Civilian Conservation Corps labor from CCC Camp NP-2 at the eastern end of the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway. The station was designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Design in the National Park Service Rustic style, featuring rough sandstone walls. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003710. South Entrance Sign *The East and South Entrance Signs are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The signs comprise two locally quarried red sandstone pillars flanking the east and south entrance road, with a horizontal log projecting from one pylon supporting a sign. The signs were designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs in 1936 and was built by Civilian Conservation Corps labor from Camp NP-2. They were altered in 1940 to the design of Park Service architects H.W. Young and A.C. Kuehl. The sign reflects a consistent design theme that was developed for many park structures in Zion. The signs are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with the east sign listed on July 7, 1987, with reference number 86003710 and the south sign on February 14, 1987, as 86003713. (east) and (south). Park Service facilities *The Grotto Camping Ground Comfort Stations were built in the same style and material as the Grotto Residence. The south station was built in 1925, while the north station was built in 1930-31 to a design by Harry Langley. The walls are massive stepped sandstone in 15-to-18-inch courses with board-and-batten infill at the gables and roof overhangs at the sides and overhangs at the ends. Both were renovated in 1959. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, their reference numbers are 86003704 (south) and 86003705 (north). (south) and (north). *The South Campground Comfort Station was designed by W.G. Carnes of the Western Division of the Branch of Plans and Design and built in 1934 using rustic design elements of preceding buildings. The South Campground building was \\\\listed on the NRHP on February 14, 1987, with reference number 86003708. *The South Campground Amphitheater was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 and 1935. The CCC work is visible in the stonework of the stage and its retaining walls, walkways and steps. Red sandstone was used in accordance with NPS Rustic design principles. The original wood benches were placed on stone blocks and were replaced with metal seats in 1956. The amphitheater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003717. Employee and service facilities Museum-Grotto Residence *The Museum-Grotto Residence is the oldest building remaining in Zion National Park. The Grotto structure was built in 1924 as the Park Museum, then rebuilt as a residence in 1936 to a design by Harry Langler of the NPS Branch of Plans and Designs, using CCC labor. The stonework is significantly larger in scale than later work. The Grotto Residence was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, reference number 86003721 on February 14, 1987. East Entrance Residence *The East Entrance Residence is a companion to the similar East Entrance Checking Station. The residence was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 to a design in the National Park Service Rustic style by the Branch of Plans and Design. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, reference 86003712. The residence was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003712. *The Pine Creek Residential Historic District was designed by Thomas Chalmers Vint to house Park Service staff, setting the style for smaller buildings at Zion. Located near the original headquarters of the park, the five major buildings in the complex were built in 1929-1930 using red sandstone, cedar shingles and milled lumber. The district includes the Superintendent's Residence. The Pine Creek district was individually listed on the National Register on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003736. *The buildings of the Oak Creek Historic District were built during the 1930s and early 1940s in what had by then become the standard National Park Service Rustic style adapted for use at Zion. The Oak Creek compound provided housing for Park Service employees as well as service and utility facilities. Most were constructed by CCC labor. A number of Mission 66 buildings were constructed in the 1950s, but are not considered contributing structures. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003706. Trails *The Canyon Overlook Trail was built by Civilian Conservation Corps labor in 1933 from the east portal of the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel to and overlook at the Great Arch. The design was overseen by local park officials for consistency with other trail improvements in Zion. The rail was listed on the National Register on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003722. *A total of long, the East Rim Trail was improved by local rancher John Winder in 1896. Originally an Indian trail, it was further improved in 1918-1919 by the National Park Service. The lower two miles of trail provided access to the Cable Mountain Draw Works. The trail improvements include rubblestone retaining walls typical of park improvements found elsewhere in Zion. The East Rim Trail was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003723. Angels Landing Trail *The Angels Landing Trail-West Rim Trail was built in 1926 following the completion of the East Rim Trail. The Angels Landing trail climbs a sandstone spine, providing rails and chain handholds for a climb in . It joins the West Rim Trail, built in 1925-26 and extended in 1935. Both trails were planned by Thomas Chalmers Vint of the NPS Branch of Plans and Design and Walter Ruesch, the Zion Park building foreman. Reusch lent his name to Walter's Wiggles, a series of 21 switchbacks. The trails were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003707. *The Emerald Pools Trail begins at the Zion Lodge westward to Lower Emerald Pool. Built in 1932, it was created using only hand tools. An extension built the same year runs to the Grotto Campground. The first section required the construction of stone steps to a high standard of design and finish. Repairs to the stonework were carried out in 1969. The trail was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003725. *The Gateway to the Narrows Trail, also known as the Riverside Walk, is a relatively short nature trail of one mile along the Virgin River. It connects the parking area at the Temple of Sinawava with The Narrows and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The trail uses local materials such as red sandstone to blend with its surroundings, following the tenets of the National Park Service Rustic style. Survey work was carried out in 1928 by National Park Service engineer Guy D. Edwards. Construction began the following year under the supervision of Walter Ruesch. On August 1, 1968, a rock slide buried a 250-foot portion of the trail with debris ranging from three to twenty feet deep. Rather than removing the rock, the trail was routed over the slide. The trail was upgraded for accessibility by the handicapped in 1982. The trail and kiosk were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003726. *The Grotto Trail begins at Zion Lodge, running along the floor of the valley to the Zion Museum at what is now the Grotto Picnic Area along the original path of the Floor of the Valley Road. The trail was designed by landscape architect Harry Langley and was built by the National Park Service in 1932 using only hand tools. Sandstone retaining walls and culverts were used to continue the rustic style. The Grotto Trail was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1986, reference number 86003914. Hidden Canyon Trail *The Hidden Canyon Trail was built in 1928 under the guidance of Guy D. Edwards and F.A. Kittredge to provide access to a hanging canyon. The trail consists of three sections. The first section starts at the East Rim Trail and runs for as a horse trail with eleven switchbacks with dry- laid sandstone retaining walls. The section was built as a hikers-only trail along a natural shelf, with a small section of blasted passage with steps and a hand rail. The final section was blasted from a steep slope by workers hanging from ropes. The completed work was designed to blend into the landscape, while vegetation was preserved during construction. The Hidden Canyon Trail was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003731. Archeological sites *Parunuweap Canyon Archeological District includes several Ancestral Puebloan ruins dating between 500-1150 AD. The sites are associated with the Virgin Anasazi peoples and consist of small masonry dwelling and granary complexes. The site was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1996, reference number 96001235. The West Rim Trail follows along the rim with views of Phantom valley and the canyons to the south. Other historic places *The Cable Mountain Draw Works was built by David Flanigan beginning in 1901, although he had first proposed the system as a teenager in 1885. From 1904, timber was harvested from the heights above the valley and moved from Cable Mountain down to the draw works in the valley, a vertical distance of . The system fulfilled an 1863 prophecy made by Brigham Young that timber would descend from the cliffs \\"like a hawk flying.\\" Before the draw works were constructed, the timber on Cable Mountain was obtained only by a ten-day round trip. Flanigan sold the operation in 1906 to Alfred Stout and O.D. Gifford of Springdale, who operated it as the Cable Mountain Timber Works. The draw works were destroyed by lighting and rebuilt in 1911. Intermittent operation continued until 1926 when the system was abandoned. The cables were removed in 1930. It is the oldest pre-park structure in Zion. The site was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 1978, reference number 78000281. :The chief remaining structure is a wood headframe on Cable Mountain. The structures at the bottom of the cables consisted of snubbing posts to separate the cables. Nothing remains of the lower end of the draw works. *The Pine Creek Irrigation Canal was excavated around the 1890s by Mormon farmers, using water from Pine Creek to irrigate farmland for about on the west side of the Virgin River near Bridge Mountain. Water was drawn from Pine Creek just upstream from the creek's confluence with the Virgin River and used to feed the Flanigan Ditch distribution system. Original rock retaining walls remain visible in some sections. New headworks were built in 1934 by Civilian Conservation Corps labor from Camp NP-2 using a sandstone boulder as an anchorage, to draw water directly from the Virgin River 1/4 mile upstream from Pine Creek, conveying the water over Pine Creek in a flume. Funding was provided by the Public Works Administration. The Pine Creek Canal was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003734. *The Oak Creek Irrigation Canal was built in 1935 by CCC labor to irrigate vegetation in the park's South Campground. Additional improvements were undertaken in 1941 to replace wood flumes and to build new concrete diversion dams. The canal diverts water from the North Fork of the Virgin River with a diversion dam that spans the river. A headgate on the west bank controls the flow. Further works executed in 1959 and 1961 provide irrigation to the visitor center and the Pine Creek residential area before laterals take off to irrigate the South Campground. The ditch then rejoins the river. The canal is largely lined with concrete. A siphon connected to the south entrance plaza. The Oak Creek Canal was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003738. *Flanigan Ditch was constructed about 1880 by the Flanigan family, Mormon pioneers in the Zion valley. The Flanigans acquired water rights for a portion of the flow of the Virgin River in 1880 to water the family's lands along the river. The family was prominent, with the feature now known at \\"The Watchman\\" called \\"Flanigan Peak\\", while the location of the present Watchman campground was called Flanigan Field. Over time, the farmlands on the lower portion of the ditch were abandoned below the present outlet at the Watchman campground. The buried portion of the ditch is regarded as a potential archeological feature relating to the period of pioneer settlement. The lands surrounding the ditch were acquired by the Park Service from the Flanigans in 1960. Of the original of ditch, about are within the park, with the upper third largely intact but unwatered for part of its length. A portion continues to carry water for irrigation of the Watchman campground. Expansion of the park boundaries has included a buried and abandoned portion of the lower ditch. The ditch shares its headworks with the Springdale Consolidated Irrigation Company's pipeline, which provides municipal water to the town through a pipeline installed in 1988. Flanigan Ditch was listed on the NRHP on January 12, 1998, reference number 97001630.

It consists of a commercial office tower, a residential tower and a podium housing a shopping mall which connects the two. Owned by Chulalongkorn University, construction on the complex began in 1994 but was halted from 1996 to 2005 and later completed in 2008. With forty floors and a height of , the office tower is the thirty-eighth-tallest building in Thailand . History Originally known as CU Hi-tech Square, the project, owned by Chulalongkorn University, was to be developed by Siam Techno City Co, Ltd., a joint venture majorly owned by Thai Farmers' Bank (now Kasikornbank), Loxley Group and the Japan International Development Organization (Jaido), with Thai Shimizu Co., Ltd. as contractor, and sales management by Chesterton Thai Property Consultants. Construction began in 1994 with completion expected by 1997 and an estimated project value of seven billion baht. The original design consisted of a forty-storey office tower and a thirty-nine-storey residential tower, with a central linking podium (referred to as the atrium) featuring a convention centre, retail shops and direct access to the to-be-constructed MRT. Parking space was to be provided underground as well as in the lower levels of the office tower. The development concept was based on visions of a hi-tech office building and convention centre equipped with advanced intelligent systems. In 1996, due to poor sales outlook, work on the project was halted when the towers had only reached their thirteenth floors. The original development plans became abandoned amidst the ensuing 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, which saw sharply falling demand for commercial office space, and Hi-tech Square stood derelict among Bangkok's many uncompleted buildings for the next near-decade. In 2002, the university's Property Management Office decided to revive the project and approved 300 million baht from the university's funds for development of the project, with additional investment expected to come from the private sector. The first phase of reconstruction, which was subcontracted to Ruam Nakhon Construction (RNC Thailand), consisted of repairing and completing the basement and atrium, and began in late 2004, due for completion by the end of 2005. However, due to flooding, only 70 percent of the work was completed on time. The remaining development, costing an estimated 2.7 billion baht which was funded solely by the university after failing to attract private investment, was awarded to Powerline Engineering PCL, which began work in April 2006. The project underwent a few changes in design, including the reduction of the residential tower's height to 23 floors and the abandonment of the convention centre in favour of an \\"edutainment centre\\" concept, and was renamed Chamchuri Square. Construction was completed in early 2008, and the complex opened on 9 July the same year. Design and location The Chamchuri Square complex consists of a forty-storey office building (Chamchuri Office Tower) with parking space on the second to tenth floors; a twenty-three-storey luxury apartment building (Residence Tower) featuring 126 standard rooms let for thirty-year long-term leases; and the four-storey connecting \\"atrium\\" section (Chamchuri Square). The atrium section, which is promotionally billed as \\"the Edutainment Gateway\\", is a shopping mall with of retail space featuring several bookshops, restaurants, education service centres, as well as miscellaneous service and retail shops. It is notably home to a branch of the Chulalongkorn University Book Center and an exhibition centre of the National Science Museum. The atrium is also used as a small-scale event venue. Located on of Chulalongkorn University land on the northeastern corner of Sam Yan Intersection (Phaya Thai and Rama IV Roads) next to the Thai Red Cross Society and opposite Wat Hua Lamphong, Chamchuri Square is directly connected to the MRT's Sam Yan Station; it was the first building to feature such an internal connection. The taller of the two buildings, Chamchuri Office Tower, at in height, was the thirty- eighth-tallest building in Thailand . With of leasable class A office space, it was the largest office building to be completed in the country since before the 1997 financial crisis. Its office space is managed by CB Richard Ellis, which in late 2008 leased to Dtac, the building's largest tenant, in what was the largest-ever office lease in Thailand.

History The club was founded in 1933 as DVO and later changed its name to DOVO to set itself apart from a nearby club with an identical name. DOVO won section championships in lower leagues in 1936, 1937,1938, 1948, 1949, 1958, 1960, and 1967. In 1970 DOVO promoted to the Eerste Klasse, where it initially won sections in 1975, 1977, 1979, 1989, 1991, and 1994. In 1974, it drew national attention by beating NSVV from Numansdorp, 11‚Äì0, while pointing out that DOVO players had made mistakes. In 1979 it also became the Saturday Champion of the Netherlands. From 1996 to 20017 it played in the Hoofdklasse, except for two seasons back in the Eerste when it took Eerste Klasse championships (2007 and 2011).

The film is set in the title city during the Reconstruction Era of the United States. Plot summary Blayde Hollister (Gary Cooper) is a former Confederate out to revenge himself on a group of carpetbaggers who murdered his family and destroyed their home in Georgia. With the help of his friend Wild Bill Hickok (Reed Hadley), Hollister's death is faked and he accompanies and swaps identities with Federal Marshal Martin Weatherby (Leif Erickson). Martin is an inexperienced dude from the East using the position of Marshal to impress his fianc√©e Tonia (Ruth Roman), whose Mexican family is being terrorised by the same gang that murdered Reb's family and terrorised Georgia. Hollister, posing as the dude Martin, protects both men and lets them get closer to the carpetbaggers.

Novelization Approximately concurrent with the release of the film and probably (in the tradition of the era) a month or two in advance, Gold Medal Books issued a novelization of the screenplay. Its prolific author, writing under his own name, Will F. Jenkins, would become and remain better known by his alternate by-line, Murray Leinster, under which he is considered one of the essential pioneers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction.

They overlap with some capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS), although their primary function is the reporting of statistical data rather than the analysis of geospatial data. LIS also tend to offer some common knowledge management functionality for storage and retrieval of unstructured data such as documents. They deliver functionality to load, store, analyse and present statistical data that has a strong geographic reference. In most cases the data is structured as indicators and is linked to discrete geographic areas, for example population figures for US counties or numbers claiming unemployment benefit across wards in England. The ability to present this data using data visualization tools like charts and maps is also a core feature of these systems. The term \\"LIS\\" has emerged since 2004, primarily in the UK public sector. To date it is not widely used elsewhere although other terms like Community Information Systems apply to solutions, primarily in North America, that have a great deal of overlap. Another widely used and largely synonymous term is Data Observatory. Data Observatory is a more widely used term internationally particularly within the area of public health where sites which often include this type of statistical reporting application are often termed a health observatory. The primary application for LIS is to provide a place-focused evidence base that is easily accessible to a wide range of users including data experts, managers, policy makers, front- line staff and citizens. They provide a wide range of statistics and reports allowing users to review the current evidence base and build a picture of localities and neighbourhoods for their area of interest. LIS are commonly used by partnerships where they need to come together to provide joined-up services for a common area. The ability to have a common evidence base and a platform to share sensitive and non-sensitive data is critical in this situation. LIS enables partners to publish a wide range of indicators in the form of defined outputs which combine locally and nationally available data into more meaningful intelligence aimed at specific user groups  Background  In the UK, like many other countries, there has been a rapid growth in the availability of small area statistics. National Neighbourhood Statistics projects across the UK, set up as a result of the PAT 18 report,Cabinet Office PAT 18 Report have opened up access to a wide range of government small area based statistics. This has been accompanied by a gradual shift across the public sector, a shift that remains very much on-going, towards the recognition that policy and decisions should be influenced to a greater degree by evidence. There also continues to be a growing acceptance that some services can be more effectively delivered by targeting resources at specific areas of need ‚àí the idea of high demand 'hotspots'. This relies on having reliable and detailed data about the needs of customers, in this case citizens, and where they live, work and take leisure time. In England in particular this has led to a rapid increase in the number of Local Information Systems particularly within local Authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. This development has been actively supported by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) under their ‚ÄòNeighbourhood Renewal‚Äô agenda. A national research project was funded to identify examples and disseminate best practice ‚Äì this reported publicly in 2004 and led to a more formal reportLocal Information Systems: A review of their role, characteristics and benefits being published in 2006. CLG's role as a catalyst in this area is further re-enforced through its provision of Neighbourhood Renewal Funds (NRF) - this funding was used by a number of authorities to pump-prime their initial LIS developments. An initiative is currently on-going through the CLG Information Management Programme to coordinate all LIS activity across local government and partnerships.CLG LIS Resources Home page This has led to regular national LIS meetings and a dedicated LIS forum. To date it is estimated that approximately 50 per cent of top tier authorities in England now have some form of LIS. In some cases these have been built as bespoke solutions, in other cases they are based on off- the-shelf products. Elsewhere within the UK this figure is lower although an initiative has been launched in Scotland in 2009 resulting in a Scottish LIS ToolkitImprovement Service LIS Toolkit to complement the English version.CLG LIS Toolkit  Data  The range of data managed within a LIS can be wide and classified in many different ways. Most common is some form of domain specific classification where indicators are grouped into top level categories like ‚ÄòDemography‚Äô, ‚ÄòHealth and Welfare‚Äô, ‚ÄòCrime and Community Safety‚Äô, ‚ÄòEducation and Children's Services‚Äô, ‚ÄòEnvironment‚Äô and ‚ÄòEconomy‚Äô. There may also be cross-cutting themes such as ‚ÄòPerformance‚Äô and ‚ÄòSocial Disadvantage‚Äô. In the UK key government data sources include ONS Neighbourhood Statistics, CLG, Dept for Work and Pensions, NOMIS, Audit Commission and several areas of NHS information services. However the real value of LIS is their ability to combine national data with local data available from a wide range of internal business systems including those of partners. This local data is often not provided to central government and, even when it is, it tends to be in a form that limits its value.

One of the main interests of Clinical Cancer Research is on clinical trials that evaluate new treatments together with research on pharmacology and molecular alterations or biomarkers that predict response or resistance to treatment. Another priority for Clinical Cancer Research is laboratory and animal studies of new drugs as well as molecule-targeted agents with the potential to lead to clinical trials, and studies of targetable mechanisms of oncogenesis, progression of the malignant phenotype, and metastatic disease. The journal is published by the American Association for Cancer Research.  History  The first issue of Clinical Cancer Research was published in January 1995. By 1 December 1994, 128 manuscripts had been submitted for publication by investigators representing a variety of clinical and laboratory disciplines not only from the United States but also from the international research community. In 1998, the number of manuscripts submitted had risen from 500 in the first year to almost 800. The journal reported an acceptance rate of 52% at that time. With the aim to publish only papers of high quality, the editors decided to increase the stringency of review.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in Chemical Abstracts, Index Medicus, MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, and Current Contents/Clinical Medicine. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2013 impact factor of 8.193, ranking it 13th out of 202 journals in the category \\"Oncology\\".

Wattenberg (born 1970) is an American scientist and artist known for his work with data visualization. Along with Fernanda Vi√©gas, he worked at the Cambridge location of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center as part of the Visual Communication Lab, and created Many Eyes. In April 2010, Wattenberg and Vi√©gas started a new venture called Flowing Media, Inc., to focus on visualization aimed at consumers and mass audiences. Four months later, both of them joined Google as the co-leaders of the Google's \\"Big Picture\\" data visualization group in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Biography  Wattenberg grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts. He received an A.B. from Brown University in 1991, an M.S. from Stanford University in 1992, and Ph.D. in Mathematics from U.C. Berkeley in 1996. From 1996 through 2002, he lived in New York City and worked for Dow Jones, on the personal finance and investing site SmartMoney.com. In 2002 he took a position at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in its Cambridge, Massachusetts location; in 2004, he founded IBM Research's Visual Communication Lab.  Journalism  While at SmartMoney.com, Wattenberg focused on new forms of interactive web-based journalism. Early work in 1996-1997 ranged from service pieces, such as worksheets to guide financial decisions, to expository graphical narratives on subjects such as bond yield curves. In 1998 Wattenberg created the Map of the Market, which visualized the stock price performance of hundreds of publicly traded companies. The Map was the first web-based treemap and was widely imitated. Subsequently, Wattenberg started a research and development group at SmartMoney, which was responsible for interactive charts, graphs, and simulations, as well as a library of visualization components. Outside of his work at Dow Jones, Wattenberg is known for interactive visualizations that have introduced mass audiences to data sets ranging from baby names to museum collections at NASA and the Smithsonian.  Visualization research   Collaborative analysis and collective intelligence  Wattenberg, in partnership with Fernanda Vi√©gas at IBM, has published widely on collective intelligence and the social use of data visualization. Their work with visualizations such as History Flow and Chromogram led to some of the earliest publications on the dynamics of Wikipedia, including the first scientific study of the repair of vandalism.2004: Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with history flow Visualizations.

New Ways to Sift Data, Anne Eisenberg, the New York Times, August 30, 2008. which seeks to make visualization technology accessible to the public. In addition to broad uptake from individuals, the technology from Many Eyes has been used by nonprofits and news outlets such as the New York Times Visualization Lab.  Visualization techniques and theory  Wattenberg invented or co-invented many visualization techniques. The Map of the Market was based on a new algorithm for treemap layouts (see Treemapping). The Arc Diagram is a novel technique for visualizing structure in long sequences, Arc Diagrams: Visualizing Structure in Strings, Martin Wattenberg. IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2002. closely related to linear embeddings of networks, a technique that has since been used by many other designers.

Artwork  As an artist, Wattenberg uses interactive graphics and visualization as expressive media. He has primarily worked on internet-accessible projects, but has also created installations, videos, and prints. In the 1990s he began to work with information visualization as an artistic medium. For example, his Shape of Song series (1999‚Äì2002) depicted the form of musical compositions; this project exists online as well as in prints that have been exhibited in multiple venues. Starrynight (1999), a collaboration with Alexander Galloway and Mark Tribe, provided a new form of social, visual navigation for an online discussion. Idealine (2001), an interactive representation of the online art universe, was the first internet artwork commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as a very early example of an artwork that used \\"crowdsourcing\\" to gather data.Whitney Museum Artport Idealine, 2001 Wattenberg has also worked with Golan Levin, contributing to the visualization technique used in The Secret Lives of Numbers (2002). The Secret Lives of Numbers (2002) Wattenberg frequently works with Marek Walczak, with whom he formed a collaboration known as MW2MW.MW2MW home page A key theme of their work is the relationship between language and space. For example, Apartment took inspiration from the concept of a memory palace, turning free-form text entered by a viewer into an architectural floorplan. The piece has appeared in many versions, including online (2000), an installation at the Whitney Museum of American Art (2001) and in many other venues. Other works explore the possibilities of interaction: the Thinking Machine series (2004‚Äì2008), for example, is based on a chess- playing program that attempts to best the viewer while displaying its own thinking process . Since 2003, Wattenberg has collaborated with Fernanda Vi√©gas to create interactive works that evoke the joy of \\"revelation\\". Revelatory Interfaces, online video of MIT lecture, 2004. They have used academic techniques such as history flow to create prints that have been shown in venues such as the New York Museum of Modern Art. Design and the Elastic Mind (Exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art, February 24, 2008‚ÄìMay 12, 2008) The two have also created purely artistic visualizations. For example, the Fleshmap series (2008- 2009) portrays aspects of sensuality, and includes work on the web, video, and installations. For example, Fleshmap: Touch provides a collective view of erogenous zones, Inside squash: art and sport confined, Cate McQuaid, The Boston Globe, April 29, 2009. while Fleshmap: Listen visualizes the language used to describe the body in song lyrics.

It was his father wish that Johannes should become a theologian as his two elder brothers did. Pache attended the school in Zittau, where his love to music awoke. He played piano, sang in a chorus and accomplished the first compositions. However, he neglected his school duties and stayed down. The father tried to convince him to become a teacher, all in vain. Pache resumed school in Bautzen, where he gave some music lectures and composed his first known pieces. Finally he convinced the father to let him study music in Dresden. In 1879 Pache got in Herisau his first appointment as organist and music director. Two years later he returned to Dresden, where he earned his money with casual engagements. In 1884 he moved to Leipzig, where he became known as concert pianist and composer. In Naumburg he was appointed music director and founded a widely known chorus. In these years Pache achieved material prosperity, especially after music publishers in Leipzig engaged him as advisor. Pache Memorial in Limbach (1913) Limbach Municipal Church. Pache moved to Limbach, where he was appointed cantor in 1889. During the few remaining years Pache gained high reputation. He founded a chorus, composed, and he is still today considered the originator of the widely known church music tradition there. In 1902, grateful citizens erected a monument in the town park.  Work  Pache his best known for his chorus compositions, especially for men. Many of his works were sung nationwide at his time. Among them is Die Germanenschlacht (op. 106), which Pache dedicated to Hermann Kretzschmar and his chorus in Leipzig. Moreover, Pache's choruses were highly estimated as memories by the German immigrants in the United States.A music competition in The New York Times Some instrumental pieces for violin and piano reached wide acknowledgment too.

Almost all of the scheduled service flights were Essential Air Service (EAS) routes and were then picked up by Air Midwest operating as US Airways Express. On March 29, 2007, Scenic Airlines was sold to Grand Canyon Airlines and was subsequently renamed Grand Canyon Scenic Airlines. The airline continued to operate from the Boulder City Airport providing services to Grand Canyon West, Grand Canyon, Page, Arizona, Monument Valley, Utah, and Rainbow Bridge, Utah. At that time, Grand Canyon Scenic Airlines continued to operate sightseeing flight services to the Grand Canyon every day of the year.

Oberbauer was born in Sankt Leonhard in the Alpine region of Tyrol in the Austrian Empire. He attended a primary school in his hometown and finished high school in Innsbruck. Having demonstrated artistic talent in his childhood years, Oberbauer's desire was to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts in the imperial capital Vienna. However, his father insisted that he study engineering. Three years into Oberbauer's education at the University of Graz, his father died and he dropped out. Out of financial necessity, Oberbauer offered some of his watercolour paintings depicting the old town part of Graz to the local municipality. Oberbauer's work appealed to the municipality, which encouraged him to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. However, he was again forced to drop out after two years due to financial difficulties. He spent some time working as a teacher and unsuccessfully attempted to continue his studies. In 1889, Oberbauer arrived in Sofia, the capital of the newly liberated Principality of Bulgaria, where he joined the Cadastral Office of the municipality. Oberbauer took an active part in the creation of Sofia's first cadastral map. Afterward he briefly worked at Bulgaria's Construction of State Railways and Harbours Office, though he returned to a municipal job due to layoffs. Oberbauer remained at the Sofia Municipality for the rest of his life. Besides being a municipality official, Oberbauer was actively engaged in art in Bulgaria. Impressed by the ambience of Sofia, he left behind numerous paintings of the newly liberated Bulgarian lands, with their still-oriental features, antique architecture and ancient ruins. Oberbauer's works are accurate depictions of Bulgaria's (and particularly Sofia's) appearance in the early post-Ottoman period, capturing the characteristic features of the age and location. Oberbauer's paintings depict the churches, monasteries, mosques, inns, markets and streets of late-19th-century Bulgaria. 70 of Oberbauer's works depicting the urban landscape of Sofia are part of the future Museum of Sofia's collection, to be exhibited in the Sofia Public Mineral Baths building. A small street in Lozenets, Sofia located in the surroundings of the Sofia Seminary is named Joseph Oberbauer Street in his honour. One of the American College of Sofia's full scholarships also bears his name.

It features folk artists from the UK and North America, who were tasked with the creation of new songs that had a \\"resonance and relevance to Charles Darwin\\". The artists gathered together for seven days in a farmhouse in Shropshire to compose the songs. The artists were: Chris Wood, Karine Polwart, Jez Lowe, Mark Erelli, Emily Smith, Rachael McShane, Krista Detor and Stu Hanna. History The project was put together and managed by the Shrewsbury Folk Festival and was the feature of a BBC Radio 4 documentary and a feature on Mike Harding‚Äôs BBC Radio 2 show. On 13 March 2009 eight artists gathered together at Henley Farmhouse in rural Shropshire for a week-long songwriting retreat, to create new works that related to Darwin ‚Äì who was born in Shrewsbury in 1809. The eight artists covered a wide range of songwriting experience and styles, from some of the most celebrated writers in the UK through to artists who were relatively unknown in the UK. The newly formed ‚Äògroup‚Äô performed these new songs to a sold out audience at the brand new Theatre Severn in Shrewsbury on 19 March, at the end of the songwriting week. The CD captures 17 of the songs performed on the night, and features all eight artists in both lead and supporting roles, culminating in Woods‚Äô ensemble piece. 19 songs were written and performed at the original concert, a Chopin piece and reading from Randal Keynes book Annie's Box was performed by Wood & Detor, and a final encore 'The Darwin Walk' written by Lowe was performed where each artist wrote and sung a verse of an ensemble piece. These are missing from the CD due to space limitations. The group performed the songs again at the Shrewsbury Folk Festival on 29 August 2009, the Chopin piece was not played, but the 'Darwin Walk' was. There is a DVD release of the initial concert with the fully mixed sound from the CD, the DVD includes the Chopin piece and 'The Darwin Walk' as well as extended song introductions. The DVD was never made commercially available and was only ever available at the 2009 Shrewsbury Folk Festival. The album was mixed by Stu Hanna, and the overall project directed by Neil Pearson of the Shrewsbury Folk Festival Reception The project has been reviewed favorably.

History  La Cl√≠nica del Pueblo (LCDP) was founded in 1983 to address the growing medical needs of Washington's Latino community by Salvadorian activists at the Central American Refugee Center (CARECEN) and \\"self-proclaimed North American hippies\\" at Plenty International. Many Salvadorians fled to Washington during the Salvadoran Civil War, seeking refuge, but were unable to access traditional forms of health care due to linguistic and cultural barriers and immigration status. LCDP opened to serve these immigrants, as well as other Latin Americans fleeing war-torn countries, but soon started serving the entire Latino community. Initially, LCDP provided only basic medical care one day a week, at no cost, staffed by volunteer doctors and health promoters. It quickly became a safe place for undocumented refugees to go for care from understanding individuals. As the Latino population grew, so did LCDP. It began to provide many different social services, such as health education and outreach. 1987‚Äì1995 In 1987, Dr. Juan Romagoza, himself a refugee from El Salvador, became director of LCDP. Under Romagoza, LCDP expanded the scope of its operations to alternative medicine, community health outreach and prevention. In 1989, LCDP received a grant from the DC Mayor's Office of Latino Affairs to start a HIV/AIDS program. In 1990, LCDP received its first multi-year contract from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington to provide physicals to Vietnamese refugees. At this time, LCDP was still operating under CARECEN. Due its growth, LCDP's staff and patients lobbied for autonomy and in 1995, LCDP became an independent non-profit organization. 1995‚Äìpresent From 1995-2003, LCDP grew rapidly, increasing its budget from $800,000 to $4.6 million. During this period, LCDP also began accepting reimbursements from Medicaid, which meant it was no longer a free clinic. This period also saw the creation of the interpreter services program, a Social Services Department which provided patients with case managers, and the launch of an HIV/AIDS prevention program. In 2000, LCDP received a large grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which allowed its mental health department to hire full-time therapists for the first time. In 2007, Romagoza stepped down after 20 years and returned to El Salvador to continue his medical outreach there. Enrique Cobham served as Interim Executive Director until 2009, when Alicia Wilson was appointed as Executive Director. Wilson, who was development director before her appointment as executive director, started at LCDP in 1999 as a case manager. After her appointment as Executive Director, she started \\"¬°La Cl√≠nica Adelante!\\", an ambitious agenda to grow LCDP's patient programs as well as its resources. In 2007, LCDP became a Federally Qualified Health Center and implemented a sliding-scale payment system, which ended its tenure as a \\"free-clinic\\". LCDP currently accepts some forms of private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and DC alliance. In 2007, LCDP served 7,500 clients with over 55,000 health services. As of 2019, LCDP has a staff of around 110 employees and is located across 5 different sites in Washington DC and Prince George's County, Maryland.  Service areas LCDP patient services are divided into four different areas. They are: *Medical services: provides basic health care. *Mental health/substance abuse: provides substance abuse help and mental health services *Community health action: works with communities on HIV prevention and other issues, like transgender rights and youth issues. *Language Access Services: provides patients, staff and the community at large with interpretation services.

The union was founded in 2008 by the students of Kiev University. Legalized on April 15, 2009, the union has its branches in a number of Kiev universities and also in several regional centers of Ukraine. History A student union under the name of \\"Direct Action\\" already existed in Kiev in the middle of the 1990s.

These were the first attempts to raise the students' movement in Ukraine. The trade union have been existing until 1998. In 2008, when students decided to create the new independent trade union, it was decided to take the name \\"Direct Action\\" as a sign of maintenance of youth resistance traditions. Thus, \\"Direct Action\\" of the 1990s was conventionally named \\"the first generation\\". Some activists of the \\"first generation\\" are still contributing to the work of the trade union now. Organization's goals According to the \\"Direct Action\\" manifesto, the trade union is aimed at the creation of student organization from below, which is based on the horizontal principles of coordination. This organization should gradually replace the bureaucratic apparatus and form the relations in the educational sphere on the basis of equal rights, direct democracy and cooperation. The union is fighting against the commercialization of the education, aiming at absolutely free education. At the same time, it asserts the social rights of students, which include improvement of conditions in dormitories, the rise of monthly allowances, the elimination of requisitions, student exploitation etc. \\"Direct Action\\" advocates the principles of free (libertarian) pedagogy in the educational process. The union strives for the equal rights of the student and the lecturer, for the democratic forming of the educational programs, the facultative attendance and subjects' choice. It also supports the full secularization of science and education. One of the main tasks of the trade union is the creation of a strong student movement, and the unity of Ukrainian and foreign liberation and emancipation movements. Premises of the trade union's activity \\"Direct Action\\" is based on the syndicalist principles of the direct self-governance. It is a non-leader structure. The leadership posts exist only formally ‚Äì all decisions are taken on a general meeting through the procedure of reaching the consensus. The union is called independent because it declares its full independence from political parties or commercial structures, and is not financed by the administration of the universities. The statute of the union states that the membership in the \\"Direct Action\\" is prohibited to the people who have racist, nazi or sexist views or support any chauvinist doctrine. Activity From the moment of its foundation the trade union became a member and the initiator of several campaigns devoted to the protection of students' and workers' rights. *July 2008. The first action of \\"Direct Action\\". Supporting the Rivne students, who opposed the educational payments rise, the trade union together with other organizations organized the picket of the Ministry of Education. As a result, the Rivne academies administration enters into negotiation with the students about the new prices. *September 2008. The union together with a number of other organizations conducted a number of actions against the anti-student resolutions of the new version of the law \\"About the Higher Education\\". In particular, \\"Direct Action\\" opposed the implementation of the compulsory labour-rent for graduates. The activists negotiated with officials from the Ministry of Education and picketed the Parliament profile committee. As a result, the members of the committee flay the bill and the Ministry of Education withdraws the disputable clauses from the document *September‚ÄìOctober 2008. Among other organizations \\"Direct Action\\" became the initiator of the campaign against the new labour code, which substantially constricts the rights of the wage labourers. The campaign started with the opening of the big banner \\"NO to the new labour code\\" during the \\"Arsenal\\" ‚Äì \\"Shachtar\\" football match. Together with other organizations the union took part in press-conferences, the picket of the Parliament profile committee, the informational campaign. The finale of the campaign was a big concert on the Khreshchatyk street \\"Rock Against the Official Slavery\\". As an outcome, the deputies postponed the bill consideration. *November 8, 2008. The activists of the union took part in a \\"Social March\\". *February 2009. The members of \\"Direct Action\\" accomplish the raids to the capital hospitals where they agitate the doctors for the creation of the independent trade union branches and fighting against the implementation of the paid medicine. *April 12, 2009. The trade union took part in a social March under the slogan \\"It's Time to Take One's Own\\". About 250 activists go on a march. During the action \\"Direct Action\\" called upon the students to strive for a free education, the rise of the monthly allowances and for the direct self-government in the universities. *May 1, 2009. The alternative May demonstration. \\"Direct Action\\" together with a number of other organizations and the independent trade unions lead out to the Kiev streets more than 400 activists with social slogans. *May‚ÄìJune 2009.

Although most are known as \\"Students' Unions\\" other common terms include \\"Guilds of Students \\" and \\"Students' Associations\\", the latter being the more common term in Scotland. Student unions facilitate student societies, such as sports clubs and student newspapers, as well as representing students politically to their respective universities and at a national level. Most unions are affiliated to the National Union of Students, although it is possible for unions to disaffiliate from the NUS and for individual students not to be a member of their union. Although most students' unions are members of the NUS, there are several other representative bodies of which unions may be members, such as the Aldwych Group, for unions of Russell Group institutions, and the National Postgraduate Committee, which represents postgraduate students. In Northern Ireland, all unions are members of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland. Students' unions tend to be run by a team of student-elected sabbatical officers. Funding for the unions comes from a \\"block grant\\" from the university and the provision of services to members through the running of shops and bars. Students' unions are regulated under the Education Act 1994, an Act of Parliament which states that student unions must be run in a democratic manner. Edinburgh University Students' Association is the oldest students' union in the United Kingdom and Liverpool Guild of Students is England's oldest students' union. The University of Glasgow is unique in having two independent students' unions, although undergraduates usually only join one of these (but can choose to join both). Some Common Rooms at collegiate universities also have the status of students' unions under the 1994 Education Act and exist as independent charities.

Billingsgate Island Light history The Billingsgate Island Light was a famous historic landmark located on what was once an inhabited island in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. When the island was habitable, the Billingsgate Island light was an important landmark to all fisherman and seaman. The light was constructed in 1822, but its light was not lit until 1858 due to construction. The Billingsgate Island Light stood tall at 41 feet. Since modern building technology was not yet integrated in architecture, the Island light had a base foundation of granite and wall construction made of brick and mortar. Since electric lights were not invented until 1879 by Thomas Edison, the Billingsgate Island light's primary source of power was kerosene fuel. The preferred lens used by the Island light was called a Fresnel lens. At this time in history, Fresnel lenses were the most advanced in lighthouse lens technology. Fresnel lenses used a series of prisms and patterns within the glass itself which acted like a diamond. Fresnel lenses weighed roughly five to eight tons based on their size. The Fresnel lens was capable of reaching visible distances of 12-26 nautical miles.] Billingsgate town history Billingsgate Island was a large fishing village located in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts. Billingsgate became its own town with its own baseball team, a school and more than thirty homes. Before the construction of the Billingsgate Island light, there was another lighthouse, but it was also destroyed in a storm. In the storm that destroyed the light in 1915, all residents fled Billingsgate before the storm came, floating all of their homes and personal belongings across the bay. The only two people left on the island as the storm passed were the lighthouse keeper and the shellfish keeper who ended up dying in the flood. What is left of Billingsgate Island is only visible at low tide. Most of what is left on Billingsgate Island was either later torn down in the 1930s and 1940s or destroyed by coastal erosion. Billingsgate Island is commonly referred to as Mini-Atlantis because it was once a community where people lived but is now underwater. The Billingsgate fishing community was known for fishing and capturing Sea Bass, Tuna and whale fishing. Currently Billingsgate is only accessible by boat and at low tide. Today, it is used as a picnic area and for shell-fishing. Billingsgate island land purchase Billingsgate Island was originally a public use land shared by Native Americans and commercial fishermen. On July 2, 1822, the U.S. government purchased four acres of the original 60 acres of land on the island including the Billingsgate Island light for only $100. The United States government decided to construct a thirty-nine foot wall barrier between the ocean and the coastline of Billingsgate in-order to try to preserve and protect the Island light from storms. After the first wall was built, the ground beneath quickly eroded and split Billingsgate Island in half. After the Island split in half, the government decided to build another wall, this time towering 100 feet tall. Instead of being beneficial to the lighthouse and the community of Billingsgate, it did the opposite, speeding up the erosion process of the island. Billingsgate Island Light Construction The Billingsgate Island light was in operation from 1858 to 1915, when it was destroyed in a storm in 1915. The Billingsgate storm of 1915 was strong enough to not only destroy the lighthouse, but also completely wipe the town of Billingsgate off the face of the earth. The only thing left of the Billingsgate Island is the granite foundation of the Island Light. The tower shape was square, which was quite unusual for lighthouse architecture. Most lighthouses constructed at the time were circular. Lighthouse shapes were primarily circular because they were stronger. Other than the lighthouse being destroyed by a storm in 1915, the lighthouse's architecture was one of the main reasons for its failure to stand. The Billingsgate lighthouse when first constructed, had only one Fresnel lens, but then was later replaced with eight oil lamps (Fresnel), newer and stronger which were capable of reaching longer distances. The roof of the lighthouse was painted a bright red and black swirl so that it was most visible at longer distances. Lighthouse Keepers Lighthouse keepers lived inside of lighthouses anywhere from a week to a few years at a time. In older times, they had to stay awake for hours at a time to rewind the lighthouse's turning mechanism for the light and relay communication to ships that land was near. They also helped ship pilots navigate the waterways through Morse code and later, proper radio communication. Lighthouse keepers were required to be a middle aged man with a high school education, clean and orderly, with a family and the ability to communicate with formal ship communication techniques. Lighthouse keepers were held to an oath to keep the light of the lens lit every day of the year, no matter the conditions. In the case of the Keeper of Billingsgate Island light, he stood watch till the death and complete deactivation of the lighthouse in 1915.

January 1915 Peek & Cloppenburg is an international chain of retail clothing stores with headquarters in Germany. The chain is operated by two separate and independent companies, Peek & Cloppenburg KG D√ºsseldorf (known as P&C; West) and Peek & Cloppenburg KG Hamburg (known as P&C; North). History On 20 April 1900, the Dutch merchants Johann Theodor Peek (1845‚Äì1907) and Heinrich Anton Adolph Cloppenburg (1844‚Äì1922) founded \\"Peek et Cloppenburg GmbH\\" in the city of D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Both men had moved from the Netherlands to Germany. A short time after the company was formed they opened their first store in the center of D√ºsseldorf.

Hashem Zamani obtained his primary education at the local mosque. He was 16 when, together with more than 100 family members, was imprisoned at Deh Mazang prison in Kabul, under the pretext of \\"political imprisonment\\". While in prison, he met with and was influenced by the presence of prominent personalities of the time, for instance, Yaqub Khan Ghond Mashar, Sarwar Joya, Dr Mahmoodi and Ferqa Mashar Ghulam Nabi Khan Charkhi along with his family. Mohammad Hashem spent 13 years of his life in Deh Mazang prison, where he witnessed the demise of 28 members of his family due to various diseases and malnourishment. After 13 years of imprisonment, Zamani and his family were exiled in Herat for a further eight years. He took part in the Grand Assembly convened during the presidency of Mohammed Daoud Khan as the representative of the people of Kunar. Due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979, Mohammad Hashem took refuge in Peshawar, Pakistan. He traveled extensively and participated in many different international conferences and gatherings. In 1987, Zamani migrated to the United States and settled in the Bay Area of San Francisco, California. In the face of chronic ill health due to a second heart attack, and a stroke suffered in 1990 that paralyzed one half of his body, Mohammad Hashim continued his writings. He wrote the second part of \\"Scattered Flowers\\" and \\"The Injured Heart collection\\" as well as published 'Zindani Khaaterat\\". He was working through to the last night of his life on the second volume of his book which is currently being published, \\"Da Pohenay Inqilab\\",(or The Revolution of Consciousness). Mohammad Hashem Zamani died due to a heart attack on 10 June 2005, in Hayward, California at the age of 76. His body was transferred to Afghanistan and buried in his native Kunar Province. Academic life Mohammad Hashem wrote his initial poems in prison, assembled in the collection known as Zendani Ehsas, or The Emotion of Prison. His poems, articles and creative pieces have been extensively published in various prominent Afghan publications such as Anees, Hewad, Islah, Wranga, Sistan, Tolo-i- Afghan, Baidaar and Etifaqi-Islam. Qutbi Khers, or Polar Bear, was Zamani‚Äôs first book of the Soviet-Afghan War era. The book has been translated into English, and some portions also into French, Italian and Spanish.

Latvia (46726/99) was a case argued before the European Court of Human Rights and decided in 2002. Facts Mrs. I. Podkolzina, member of Equal Rights partyLatviju ies≈´dz Strasb≈´ras tiesƒÅ valodas prasmes apliecƒ´bas dƒìƒº was included in the list of the candidates of the National Harmony Party for 1998 parliamentary elections, submitted in July. At the time of the registration of its list of candidates the party supplied the Central Electoral Commission with all the documents required, including a copy of the certificate attesting to the fact that the applicant knew the State's official language ‚Äì Latvian. On 6 and 7 August 1998 an examiner employed by the State Language Inspectorate, went to the applicant's place of work and examined her to assess her knowledge of Latvian. The examiner then drew up a report to the effect that the applicant did not have an adequate command of the official language at the ‚Äúthird level‚Äù, the highest of the three categories of competence defined in Latvian regulations and the one then required for eligibility in parliament. By a decision of 21 August 1998 the Central Electoral Commission struck the applicant's name out of the list of candidates. The NHP, acting on the applicant's behalf, asked the Riga Regional Court to set aside the above decision. The court held that there had been no breach of the law. Proceedings The applicant was represented before ECtHR first by I. Ozi≈°a, member of Latvian Human Rights Committee, and later by W. Bowring, a British barrister. The Latvian Government were represented by their agent K. Maƒºinovska. By a decision of 8 February 2001 the Chamber declared the application admissible.Admissibility decision Judgment On 9 April 2002 ECHR has delivered a unanimous judgment. The Court emphasised that the validity of the applicant's certificate was never questioned by the Latvian authorities. It further noted that it was issued to the applicant after an examination organised by a board composed of five examiners. The Court noted that \\"the procedure followed differed fundamentally from the normal procedure for certification of linguistic competence, which is governed by the above- mentioned regulation of 25 May 1992. In particular, the additional verification to which the applicant was subjected was carried out by one examiner instead of a board of experts and the examiner was not required to observe the procedural safeguards and assessment criteria laid down in the regulation. Thus the full responsibility for assessing the applicant's linguistic knowledge was left to a single civil servant, who had exorbitant power in the matter. Moreover, the Court can only express its surprise over the fact ‚Äì related by the applicant and not disputed by the Government ‚Äì that during the examination the applicant was questioned mainly about the reasons for her political orientation\\" (see para. 36). Considering the Riga Regional Court's judgment, ECHR held that its sole basis was the certificate drawn up by the State Language Centre after the examination in issue; it did not rule on the other evidence in the file. The Court therefore considered that \\"in admitting as irrebuttable evidence the results of an examination the procedure for which lacked the fundamental guarantees of fairness, the Regional Court deliberately avoided providing a remedy for the violation committed\\" (see para. 37). Therefore, the Court has found a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in the case and ordered Latvia to pay Podkolzina 9000 euros. The Court found it unnecessary to examine complaints under Articles 13 and 14 separately. Aftermath Though the ECtHR judgment didn't require Latvia to abolish language requirements for candidates, it did so in May, 2002, after indications of desirability from George Robertson, US governmentHuman Rights in Latvia in 2002 ‚Äî p. 9.

The film won 26 awards at 23 film festivals.  Plot  Two police officers knock on the door of a home and a drunk man answers. Rip Porter lives at the house with his wife Wendy. The police say they are checking on an emergency call and find Rip drunk and Wendy injured. They arrest Rip, and he is sent to prison. Seven years later, Rip is released from prison. Rip has changed; he is now sober and has taken anger management courses. When Rip suggests starting a family, Wendy feels forced to reveal that she gave birth to their son while he was in prison but gave the baby up for adoption to the Campbells who live in Florida. Rip immediately wants custody of his son, and has a right to do so because Wendy forged his signature on the adoption papers. Jack and Molly Campbell have enjoyed an idyllic life with Joey, Wendy and Rip's son. When a judge upholds Rip and Wendy's claim, Molly and Jack are distraught. Joey's first visit with Wendy and Rip goes exceptionally well. As a last resort, Jack travels to Ohio and offers Rip money in exchange for Joey. Rip refuses, and gets in a physical altercation with Jack. Since this confrontation, Rip starts drinking again due to stress. On the next visit when Joey refuses to take a shower, Rip is at first patient but eventually loses his temper. He roughly puts Joey in the shower, and unintentionally leaves a bruise on Joey's arm. Before Joey leaves, Wendy tells him about making a wish by blowing on a dandelion. Once he's gone, Wendy tells Rip that she arranged for Joey to spend an extra week with Jack and Molly. This upsets Rip and he seriously assaults Wendy. When Joey returns home, he shows his bruise to Jack and Molly and tells them what happened. Molly convinces Jack they should flee the country with Joey. They join a church mission trip to Haiti, with Molly's sister and her husband. Jack has arranged for the three of them to fly out to another country. However, Molly's sister is suspicious and calls Allyson Bower, the child services agent in charge of Joey's case. The Campbells are returned to the US where they meet with Allyson Bower and Wendy. A regretful Rip agrees to receive help and guidance for his alcoholism and anger problems in the hope of becoming a better man. Wendy tells the Campbells that Rip never meant to hurt Joey, but that he is not ready to be a father. Jack apologizes to her for trying to bribe Rip. Ultimately, Wendy agrees to hand Joey over to them permanently and signs a revised adoption paper with Rip's signature. As Wendy bids Joey goodbye, she expresses her hopes that she and Rip can have a relationship with him when he grows older.

As nonlinear absorption can affect the measurement of the non-linear index, the open method is typically used in conjunction with the closed method to correct the calculated value. For measuring the real part of the nonlinear refractive index, the z-scan setup is used in its closed-aperture form. In this form, since the nonlinear material reacts like a weak z-dependent lens, the far-field aperture makes it possible to detect the small beam distortions in the original beam. Since the focusing power of this weak nonlinear lens depends on the nonlinear refractive index, it would be possible to extract its value by analyzing the z-dependent data acquired by the detector and by cautiously interpreting them using an appropriate theory. To measure the imaginary part of the nonlinear refractive index, or the nonlinear absorption coefficient, the z-scan setup is used in its open-aperture form. In open- aperture measurements, the far-field aperture is removed and the whole signal is measured by the detector. By measuring the whole signal, the beam small distortions become insignificant and the z-dependent signal variation is due to the nonlinear absorption entirely. Despite its simplicity, in many cases, the original z-scan theory is not completely accurate, i.e. when the nonlinear medium response to laser radiation is nonlocal in space. Whenever the laser induced nonlinear response at a certain point of the medium is not solely determined by the laser intensity at that point, but also depends on the laser intensity in the surrounding regions, it will be called a nonlocal nonlinear optical response. Generally, a variety of mechanisms may contribute to the nonlinearity, some of which may be nonlocal. For instance, when the nonlinear medium is dispersed inside a dielectric solution, reorientation of the dipoles (permanent or induced molecular dipoles) as a result of the optical field action is nonlocal in space and changes the electric field experienced by the nonlinear medium. The nonlocal z-scan theory, can be used for systematically analyzing the role of various mechanisms in producing the nonlocal nonlinear response of different materials. Closed-aperture z-scan technique In this setup an aperture is placed to prevent some of the light from reaching the detector. The equipment is arranged as can be seen in the diagram. A lens focuses a laser to a certain point, and after this point the beam naturally defocuses. After a further distance an aperture is placed with a detector behind it. The aperture causes only the central region of the cone of light to reach the detector. Typically values of the normalized transmittance are between 0.1. The detector is now sensitive to any focusing or defocusing that a sample may induce. The sample is typically placed at the focus point of the lens, and then moved along the z-axis a distance of \\\\pm z_{0} which is given by the Rayleigh length z_{0}: z_{0}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi W_{0}^{2}}{\\\\lambda} The thin sample approximation states that the thickness of the sample L must be less than the Rayleigh length L Open-aperture z-scan technique This method is similar to the above method, however, the aperture is removed or enlarged to allow all the light to reach the detector. This in effect sets the normalized transmittance to S = 1. This is used in order to measure the non-linear absorption coefficient ŒîŒ±. The main cause of non-linear absorption is due to two-photon absorption. Dual-arm z-scan technique When measuring the nonlinear properties of molecules in solution, the two-photon absorption of the solvent is usually small and determination of \\\\alpha_{2} for the solute is not problematic. However, this is not the case for nonlinear refraction (NLR). Typically, the NLR per molecule of the solvent is much less than that of the solute, but the large density of solvent molecules yields a large net NLR that may dominate the signal due to the solute. Additionally, there is a contribution to the measured n_{2} due to the cells used to hold the samples. In cases where the n_{2} of the solute is small, large discrepancies can arise when reporting the nonlinearity of the solute since the NLR of the solvent and cells must be subtracted from that of the solution. Thus, the determination of solute nonlinearities in regions where the NLR is similar to or much smaller than the solvent or cells has been difficult. Similarly, this problem occurs for thin-films deposited on a substrate, where both film and substrate exhibit two-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction. Dual-arm Z-scan is a modified version of the conventional Z-scan that can address this issue by simultaneously measuring and subtracting the effect of the solvent (or substrate) from the sample under study. Eclipsing z-scan This method is similar to the closed z-scan method, however the sensitivity of the system is increased by only looking at the outer edges of the beam by blocking out the central region. This is achieved by replacing the aperture with disks that block the central part of the beam. The method got its name from the way in which the light passes around the disk to the detector in a similar way to an eclipse. A further improvement to the eclipsing z-scan method is to add a lens behind the aperture so that the light is focused onto the detector, this can also reduce the need for a larger detector.

P. Liunge in 1827. The paper became the major media outlet for political Left Hegelianism in Denmark during the 1840s. The article on the frontpage from 28 November 1838 is about democracy The heading is \\"On Estate and representative constitution\\". Kj√∏benhavnsposten was an oppositional newspaper that campaigned for a democratic constitution to replace the absolutist monarchy in Denmark. Even though the strict censorship rules had been somewhat slackened during the 1830s on account of the introduction of an estates general in Denmark, the laws against political propaganda against the government remained strict. A widely used method to circumvent the censorship laws was to employ \\"strawman\\" editors who were paid to receive the fines or jail sentences that followed the transgressions of the law. Another method was to use translations of foreign articles that dealt with matters that, even though seemingly about foreign affairs, could easily be applied to political conditions in Denmark. Such is the case with the article on the scan of this edition of the newspaper. The article is a concise version of a book review originally written in German by the journalist . Florencourt reviews the book \\"Deutschland und die repr√§sentative Verfassung\\" (\\"Germany and the representative Constitution\\"), which was allegedly written by a , that condemns the representative constitution. Although the article is entirely about German affairs, there is no doubt that the message is aimed at the Danish political situation. Among other things, the note in connection with the headline conveys the information that Florencourt in the full version of the book review calls the book \\"traitorous\\" and \\"perfidious\\". One of Hans Christian Andersen's first poems, Det d√∏ende Barn (the dying child) was published in the newspaper on 25 September 1827.

Security and privacy BOLT is signed with third-party certificates from VeriSign and Thawte. These \\"signatures\\" enable the device OS to confirm BOLT's authenticity, provide access to secure device APIs, and help ensure that BOLT is free from malware and/or viruses. Signed applications enable you to use BOLT with fewer permission dialogs for file and network access from your device's OS. However, a few platforms including Motorola P2K do not allow installation of signed builds. To enable installation on these devices, an unsigned version of BOLT, with no certificate, is also offered.  Server proxy  BOLT proxied all requests via BOLT cloud servers to compress traffic and maintain site-specific information about users, such as browser cookies and site preferences and the contents of shopping carts. This solution has major security implications: BOLT could trivially track user activity and even arbitrarily tamper with content displayed by the browser. 128-bit secure (SSL) connection BOLT used an encrypted protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to access secure Web pages. The connection between the device and the BOLT server is also encrypted. Certificate error notification A certificate is an electronic document that can help identify a Web site's owner and can help you make decisions about trusting the site with personal or financial information. BOLT warns about certificate error when there is a problem with a certificate or the server's use of the certificate.

It is located in Edinburgh. The University Library was moved in 1827 to William Playfair's Upper Library in the Old College building. The collections in Edinburgh University Old College were moved in 1967 to the purpose-built eight-storey Main Library building at George Square. Today, Edinburgh's university-wide library system holds over 3.8m books, e-books and e-journals in total. History The University was founded by Royal Charter from King James VI in 1582 and opened in 1583, however the library pre-dated this by three years. The initial collection was a bequest of 276 theological books from Clement Littill, an advocate who left his collection to the town in 1580.Finlayson, 1890 Until 1708, the teaching staff consisted of four regents and the Principal, the former taking each class through a year's part of the whole arts curriculum of logic, metaphysics, ethics and physics, which included the elements of mathematics and astronomy. Until the middle of the 17th century, by which time the library must have exceeded the 2,400-odd volumes listed in Robert Lumsden's shelf catalogue of 1637, the teaching tended to be commentaries on Aristotle. Collections The Special Collections Department has about 200,000 items in all branches of knowledge. There are 1,200 incunabula, about 9,000 printed books from 16th century, 35,000 from the 17th and 18th centuries, and 60,000 from the 19th century. An important part of this collection is German Reformation tracts. Exterior of the University Main Library in George Square Among the many fine collections of the library are two which were formerly in the possession of the 19th-century Shakespearian scholar James Halliwell-Phillipps. The first collection was acquired by the library between 1872 and 1889, including a Shakespearian collection. The second collection was acquired in 1964 by purchase from Sotheby's. The University of Edinburgh is also the host of a research project in conjunction with the British Library and ATILF called The Making of the Queen's Manuscript, which focuses on Christine de Pizan's Harley MS 4431. The project is housed \\"partly in the French section of the School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures, partly in the Special Collections department of Edinburgh University Library (EUL)\\" under the supervision of the Project Director, Dr. James Laidlaw and the Project Officer, Dr. Andrew Grout, the Special Collections Digital Library Officer. Main Library building The Main Library is situated on the south-west corner of George Square, chosen because this was the quietest section of the square. Opened in 1967, the eight-storey building was designed by Sir Basil Spence. The horizontal library exterior is deliberately designed to look like a bookcase; the architecture features brutalist elements but also clear oriental features. The exterior columns on the north side feature bracketing and are non-weight bearing, in what may be seen as a humorous stab at the movements at the time following the principle that architecture must be truthful and form must follow function. Upon opening, it was the largest university library in the UK, with each floor an acre in size. Glasgow University's similar, 12-storey, brutalist library was opened the following year.  Librarians of the University of Edinburgh  The current Librarian to the University of Edinburgh is Gavin McLachlan. The current Director of Library and University Collections is Jeremy Upton. Previous Directors, Keepers and Librarians to the University include: Kenneth Logie, Andrew Munro, Thomas Spier, Andrew Suttie, Francis Adamson, James Nairne, John Mien, John Stevenson, John Kniland, John Dunlop, William Somerville, William Henderson, Robert Henderson, George Stuart, James Robertson, Andrew Dalzel, George Dunbar, Andrew Duncan, Alexander Brunton, John Small, Hugh Webster, Alexander Anderson, Frank Carr Nicholson,1875 ‚Äì 1962 Lauriston William Sharp, Erik Richard Sidney Fifoot, Brenda Moon and Ian Mowat,Ian Mowat (1946 - 2002) was University Librarian 1997 - 2002; he had previously held posts in the National Library of Scotland, and then at the universities of Glasgow, Hull and Newcastle before he reached Edinburgh. His main concern was the survival of academic libraries in the digital age; he also devoted himself to collaborations with research libraries in various eastern European and middle eastern countries, and with British library organizations such as CURL and Sconul.

He was a mayor of the town of Karvin√° for seven years. Ten days after outbreak of World War II he was murdered by Nazis. Olszak was born in ≈†enov as a tenth child of a peasant. After elementary school he attended the German gymnasium (high school) in Cieszyn, from which he graduated in 1889. He went to Vienna to study medicine at the University of Vienna. He graduated in 1895. After returning to his region, Olszak started to work as a doctor in Karvin√°, becoming the first Polish doctor for coal miners in that town. He also worked as a doctor at the ch√¢teau in Fry≈°t√°t for count Larisch-M√∂nnich, and as a family doctor for many local German engineers and administration workers. Olszak however, working mostly with poor coal miners and their families, helped to organize a social help for them. Olszak was a member and co-founder of various Polish organizations in Zaolzie. He was a member of the general committee of ZwiƒÖzek Polak√≥w w Czechos≈Çowacji (Association of Poles in Czechoslovakia) and ZwiƒÖzek ≈ölƒÖskich Katolik√≥w w Czechos≈Çowacji (Association of Silesian Catholics in Czechoslovakia). After World War I, as a member of the Association of Silesian Catholics, he took active part in the work of the National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, provisional Polish political body working for joining Cieszyn Silesia to independent Poland.Nowak 2008, 22. Olszak was regularly elected to the city council of Karvin√° and in 1929 became a mayor, beating in the elections Czech candidate Oskar Kuƒçera. On 6 July 1930 he hosted in the town the Czechoslovak president Tom√°≈° G. Masaryk and welcomed him in Polish. President Masaryk later made a speech in both Polish and Czech languages.S≈Çowik 1999, 20. On 4 July 1936 Olszak contested in next mayoral elections but lost to Czech candidate Anton√≠n Kr≈Øta.S≈Çowik 1999, 22. After the elections Olszak worked again as a general doctor for coal miners, he maintained this position after Poland annexed Zaolzie in October 1938. On 1 September 1939 World War II started and Wehrmacht entered also Zaolzie region. Dr Olszak was arrested by Nazi authorities on 2 September. On 7 September he was called out to one of local coal mines to a reputed accident. Upon arrival he was seriously beaten by Gestapo and local German coal mining administration. He was transferred to the hospital, where he died on 11 September. Bleeding to the brain was given as a cause of death in the official documents. His funeral was highly restricted by Nazi German authorities who were aware of Olszak's popularity. Although crowds of locals followed the funeral procession, only four people were allowed to enter the cemetery - wife, two sons and priest. He is buried at a cemetery in the Doly (Kopalnie) district of Karvin√°. Streets in Cieszyn and Karvin√° are named after him. His son Wac≈Çaw became an internationally acclaimed engineer and construction theorist; his son Feliks became a metallurgical engineer.

Case history  Childs was arrested in June 2008 and held on $5 million bail. He is also accused of tampering with the network and avoiding auditing checks. Childs was potentially detected when Paul Marinaccio, a Cyber Security Analyst was conducting a vulnerability assessment which required further analysis that led to Childs. Childs eluded interviews, phone calls and emails from Marinaccio. Two days prior to Childs arrest Marinaccio received an alarming email stating Childs grievances towards DTIC management and their lack of security awareness since they were previously hacked; which he claims the City officials wrote off. Marinaccio noted the unresponsiveness and email in his final report. He was found guilty of one count of felony network tampering on April 27, 2010 by a jury. On August 6, 2010, Childs was sentenced to four years in the California State Prison by Judge Teri Jackson. Childs had already served 755 days in prison as of his sentencing, which was applied to his sentence, leaving him eligible for parole after 4‚Äì6 months of incarceration.

It was a single-engined tractor biplane with a waterproof hull in the form of a flying boat to allow the aircraft to be safely landed on water in an emergency. Two prototypes and 30 production aircraft were built, the type serving briefly with the French Navy, although never operated from an aircraft carrier. Development and design In 1924, the French aircraft manufacturer Ateliers d'Aviation Fran√ßois Villiers was formed at Meudon near Paris.Gunston 2005, p.484. One of its first designs was to meet a requirement of the French Navy for a two-seat shipboard fighter. Villier's design, the Villiers II was a single-engined sesquiplane (i.e. a biplane with the lower wing much smaller than the upper wing). Although of conventional tractor configuration with the engine in the nose driving a two-bladed propeller, and a tailwheel undercarriage, in order to allow safe ditching in the event of an emergency, it had a number of unusual features, with the fuselage being watertight and in the form of a flying boat hull, and the undercarriage being jettisonable. Two prototypes were ordered, under the designation Vil 2AMC2 (Avion Marin Chasse Biplace), one powered by a 450 hp (338 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12H V12 engine and the other with a similarly powered Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb W12 engine. After evaluation by the A√©ronautique Maritime in May 1925, an order for 30 Vil 2AMC2 to be powered by the Lorraine-Dietrich engine, (together with an order for 20 of the competing Levasseur PL.5s) was placed on 19 December 1925. Operational history Villiers II after landing on water The Villiers II entered service with Escadrille 5C1 based at Hy√®res near Toulon in Southern France in May 1927, with the aircraft never being operated from B√©arn. It was replaced by the single-seat Gourdou-Leseurre GL.32, which did not have the same elaborate features for landing on water in September 1928.

The 54th Squadron was moved to reinforce Eleventh Air Force in Alaska, and only the 34th and 43d Squadrons moved with the group to Europe. To replace the lost squadrons, the 61st Troop Carrier Squadron was activated at Bowman Field in October and the 62d Troop Carrier Squadron at Sedalia Army Air Field in December 1942, However these squadrons remained in the United States to be trained and were reassigned in March 1943 without ever joining the wing.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 238, 240‚Äì241 Combat in the European Theater C-47s of the group at Spanhoe in 1944 While flying the North Atlantic ferry route, the air echelon encountered bad winter weather, causing it to remain in Greenland for about a month. While there it searched for missing aircraft and dropped supplies to downed crews. The ground echelon arrived in England in November 1942 for service with Eighth Air Force. After the air and ground echelons were united in December, the group began ferrying cargo in the British Isles and training with airborne troops and gliders. In May 1943 a detachment comprising almost all the group aircraft, aircrews, and most support personnel, deployed to North Africa to support Twelfth Air Force and other Mediterranean Theater of Operations organizations during Operation Husky, the invasions of Sicily and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy. Although the group did not participate in the airborne phase of the invasions, it did support those operations by transporting supplies in the theater. In March 1944 the detachment returned to England and rejoined the group, which had been reassigned to the Ninth Air Force in October 1943. On 7 February 1944, the group moved to RAF Spanhoe. It became part of the 52d Troop Carrier Wing of IX Troop Carrier Command. The group prepared for the invasion of the Continent. As part of its preparation, the group was brought up to full strength for the first time since arriving in England in April 1944, when the 309th and 310th Troop Carrier Squadrons were assigned to the group shortly after arriving in theater.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 375, 376‚Äì377 In April the group began formation flying training and a month later began paratroop- dropping exercises. The group continued training until 26 May. Operating alongside the 316th Troop Carrier Group for the Normandy landings, 47 aircraft of the 315th Group dropped 844 paratroops of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment's Headquarters and 1st Battalion at Drop Zone O, near Sainte-M√®re- √âglise early on 6 June. The group earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions. The group also dropped 82d Airborne Division commander Matthew Ridgway and his staff. During the drop, the group did not lose any planes as German anti-aircraft fire was sporadic and ineffectual. The group dropped paratroops of the 82d Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment near Overasselt on 17 September 1944, losing one plane. The mission was part of Operation Market Garden, a series of Allied airborne attacks in the Netherlands. The group flew reinforcement missions on succeeding days. On 18 September, 27 aircraft in two serials of the group and 36 aircraft from the 314th Troop Carrier Group dropped paratroopers of the British 4th Parachute Brigade at Drop Zone Y on Ginkel Heath. Several aircraft were lost to flak. On 21 September, the 314th and 315th Groups dropped elements of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade near Driel, after numerous weather-caused delays. Five aircraft from the group were lost in the drop. On 23 September, the group dropped without loss the 560-strong remainder of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade on Drop Zone O near Overasselt. The group landed at Grave on 26 September to unload paratroops and supplies. It airlifted gasoline and other critical supplies to Antwerp and Liege during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945. For Operation Varsity, the Allied airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945, the group staged out of RAF Boreham as a result of the need for shorter flying distances. The group released British paratroops of the 5th Parachute Brigade near Wesel on 24 March. During the operation, the group suffered its heaviest losses of the war, losing nineteen aircraft, with another 36 badly damaged. Following each airborne operation, the group resumed transport activities, hauling cargo and evacuating wounded personnel. The group moved to France in April 1945. The group transported cargo and evacuated released allied prisoners of war until after V-E Day. It moved to Trinidad in May 1945 and transported troops returning to the US. The group was inactivated on 31 July 1945.  Cold War  The group was activated at Langley Field on 19 May 1947, but was not manned or equipped, and was inactivated again on 10 September 1948. Korean War C-46Ds in Korea The group was reactivated in Japan at Brady Air Base on 10 June 1952 after being redesignated as the 315th Troop Carrier Group, Medium. It was assigned to the Far East Forces, for duty during the Korean War. The group took over the Curtiss C-46 Commando transports of the 437th Troop Carrier Group, a reserve unit that had been called up for the war and was being inactivated. The group flew troop and cargo airlift and airdrop, leaflet drops, spray missions, air evacuation, search and rescue, and other aerial missions between Japan and Korea. During US Army exercises in Japan between 1952 and 1953, it transported units. In March 1953, all C-119s in the theater were grounded as a result of malfunctioning propellers and the group's C-46s were made responsible for moving all personnel between southern Japan and Korea up to the end of the war. The group airlifted the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team along with other XVI Corps units to Korea in June and July 1953. For its actions, the group received the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. It remained in the Far East after the war to fly transport missions and paratroop training flights. The group flew missions in Japan, Korea, French Indo-China, and other points until December 1954. The group was inactivated in Japan on 18 January 1955. Vietnam War Vietnamese paratroopers jump from a group C-123B The group was organized at Tan Son Nhut Airport, Vietnam in December 1962 as the 315th Troop Carrier Group, Assault. It replaced the Combat Cargo Group, Provisional, 6492d at Tan Son Nhut. The group was initially composed of a provisional transport squadron, an aerial port squadron and a maintenance squadron and was part of the 315th Air Division.Futrell & Blumenson, p. 112 Its flying squadron, the Tactical Air Force Transport Squadron, Provisional, 2, was the successor to Operation Mule Train, which had been providing logistics support for US and Vietnamese military elements since January. The provisional squadron was manned primarily by deployed crews from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing's 346th Troop Carrier Squadron, from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina.Futrell, p. 108Ravenstein, p. 259 The group exercised control over USAF airlift resources in Vietnam, primarily flying the Fairchild C-123B Provider. It also provided combat evaluation of YC-123 aircraft between February and April 1963. By April 1963, operations had expanded to the point that the 464th Wing deployed an entire squadron, the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron, to Da Nang Air Base, and it was attached to the 315th Group.Futrell, p. 273 In July 1963, operations had expanded further, and the group was assigned permanent squadrons. On the 1st, the 777th Squadron was assigned to the group and joined by a second squadron from the 464th Wing, the 778th. A week later, the 2d was discontinued, while the 777th and 778th were returned to the 464th Wing on paper, and their personnel and equipment were transferred to the newly activated 309th, 310th and 311th Troop Carrier Squadrons.Futrell, pp. 171, 278 The commander of the group was also the director of the Southeast Asia Airlift System and maintained an airlift control officer in Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV)'s air operations center. The system managed \\"common use\\" airlift in both Vietnam and Thailand.Futrell, p. 246 Under this system, the group controlled one of the two companies of US Army de Haviland Canada CV-2 Caribou aircraft located in Vietnam between July and December 1963.MACV had agreed to place both companies under the central control of the group. However, Pacific Command directed that company be tasked with immediate support of Army corps commanders to take advantage of the Caribou's unique STOL capability. Futrell, p. 167. In the fall of 1963 MACV directed a reduction of 1000 personnel in Vietnam, which included the elimination of the 61st Aviation Company and its Caribous.Futrell, p. 167 In addition to airlift resources in Vietnam, two Bristol 170 transports of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, located in Thailand also fell within the system's control. The fall of 1963 also saw the group's C-123s beginning to augment Vietnamese Air Force C-47s on flare drop missions, using a box on the ramp of their C-123s that was fabricated by the group's maintenance men to dispense the flares.Futrell, p. 182 In the first half of 1964, group Providers flew 239 night flare sorties. Despite planned drawdowns in other areas in 1964,Both squadrons at Pleiku Air Base, the 1st Air Commando Squadron and the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron were to turn their planes over to the VNAF, but these plans, too, changed. Futrell, pp. 235‚Äì240. American commanders in Vietnam were requesting more airlift capability. In August, RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam, a Royal Australian Air Force CV-2 detachment at Vung Tau Airport, arrived and was placed under the group's control. In September, the Army also moved an additional Caribou company into the country, but these transports remained outside the control of the group. The group had conducted inspections of its C-123s in May that disclosed that all 37 aircraft that had been in country since 1962 showed visible damage, and 11 required major repair. By October, however, sufficient additional C-123s had been withdrawn from Air Force Reserve units in the United States to form a fourth Provider squadron, the 19th Air Commando Squadron.Futrell, p.236 In December, half of the 310th Troop Carrier Squadron moved to Nha Trang Air Base to replace C-47s that had been operating from that base. The remainder of the squadron would follow in June 1965. Ranch Hand UC-123B Providers with South Vietnamese markings Until July 1964, the UC-123Bs of Operation Ranch Hand, spraying defoliants, had operated with Tactical Air Command crews on temporary duty. At that time. the three planes were transferred to the group on permanent status, becoming Detachment 1, 315th Troop Carrier Group. Shortly after the transfer, Ranch Hand began crop destruction missions in addition to the defoliation missions it had flown since 1962.Futrell, pp. 247‚Äì248 The group began 1965 by airlifting the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1st and 3d Airborne Battalions to Vung Tau, where ARVN forces were engaged in a battle with Viet Cong units.Futrell, p. 261 Later that month, the group's Ranch Hand aircraft began a massive defoliation program in War Zone D designed to expose a main Viet Cong base by eliminating cover over 48 square miles of forest.Futrell, p. 264 On 8 March, the group was redesignated the 315th Air Commando Group. The group began to operate deployed Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports, which had more cargo capacity than the Provider, in 1965. The group was inactivated in March 1966 and its flying squadrons were transferred to the 315th Air Commando Wing, which was activated in its place. Reserve associate unit A group C-17 Globemaster III flies over downtown Charleston Since 1968, the Air Force Reserve had stationed associate units at Charleston Air Force Base, where the 315th Military Airlift Wing operated the Lockheed C-141 Starlifters of the regular Air Force 437th Military Airlift WingCantwell, p. 325 In August 1992, Air Force Reserve Command implemented the Objective Wing organization for its flying units and the group was activated as the 315th Operations Group to control the airlift operations of the 315th Wing. The group continued to operate the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter until around 2000, flying contingency operation, humanitarian airlift missions, and exercises worldwide. In 1993, the 315th became the first Air Force Reserve group to fly the C-17 Globemaster III. It took part in the first US-Russian joint military exercise in 1994. Since June 2017, the group has been commanded by Colonel Stephen L. Lanier.

Independent for much of its history, it was formed from the merger of H.E. Williams & Co Ltd (an ironmonger and agricultural machinery business) and another Colchester family business, H.L. Griffin & Co Ltd (a furnishings store), in April 1963. In 2007, Williams & Griffin won \\"Best Independent Department Store of the Year\\", sponsored by Drapers. The award was picked up by Colchester's MP, Bob Russell, who proposed an early day motion on the topic, but in March 2008 was sold to the Fenwick chain of department stores. Current departments include beauty, fashion, toys, gifts, housewares and furniture, as well as top-floor restaurant Carluccio's.  H. L. Griffin & Co.  Old Colcestrian Society H. L. Griffin & Co had its beginnings early in the nineteenth century, when a William Griffin set up as a linen draper along with a business partner with the surname Barrell. It was not long, however, before Griffin was independent and adding haberdashery to his business, with premises at 5 and 6 Botolph Street; they were extended in number 7 in the 1840s. At the same time a shop on the High Street was opened (number 50) but this closed after a few years, making way for premises on Head Street. In March 1855, William Griffin Senior retired, leaving the business to his son William, which was now styled \\"Griffin and Son\\". Another son, George Lainson Griffin, set up another drapery business on Botolph Street whilst a third, John Edward Griffin, set up as an auctioneer, valuer and estate agent on Queen Street, the same profession to which William Griffin Jr. also turned his hand after selling his drapery business in 1861. In the 1870s George set up a High Street Shop; not long afterwards he was succeeded in this by his son by Henry Lainson Griffin (1855‚Äì1916), certainly before 1891. Henry was primarily an upholsterer, the second of five children born to George and his wife Caroline Collins, of Stanway, Essex. Certainly, the company swapped its Colchester High Street premises on February 1, 1900 for new ones on Head Street, where it remained until 1963. Originally dealing in the sale or let of both soft furnishings such as \\"eider down quilts, coal vases etc\\" and houses, the former was its only enterprise at the time of merger with H. E. Williams. Its logo was a griffin; this remained in the weeks following the merger, despite the accompanying company name being altered.  H. E. Williams & Co.  H. E. Williams & Co., an ironmonger and agricultural machinery business, was founded by Herbert E. Williams (1862‚Äì1920) before 1882 as Williams and Co.. It was registered as a limited company in 1922. It traded both at High Street premises (which now form the modern site of Williams & Griffin), and later also at roomier premises on Cowdray Avenue further from the town centre, from where it sold most of its tractors and other farming equipment. In 1950, after the sudden death of the then chairman and the managing director (also a large shareholder), the company was taken over by Kenneth Ireland (1907‚Äì1971), a farmer from nearby Feering, it has been run since 1972 by his son Bill. At the time of the merger, the company sold ironmongery, kitchenware, electrical, radio and TV and nursery goods from its High Street premises.  Williams & Griffin  The Williams and Griffin logo, used until 2016 In April 1963, H. L. Griffin & Co and H.E. Williams & Co merged to form a combined enterprise employing 110 people. The Griffin premises were soon sold (within two years), and the output merged to create a single department store. Other acquisitions included A. & E.P. Baker in 1964 (a local ladies fashion store) and Heasman & Son (a jewellers on the High Street founded before 1907). In 1966, the Griffin family sold out - their representative on the board, Jack Griffin, wished to retire due to ill health, and his sons wanted to go their own separate ways. The majority shareholding was therefore taken up by the Ireland family, and in 1969 the final vestige of the previous businesses ‚Äì Williams' Cowdray Avenue farm machinery sideline ‚Äì was sold to Eastern Tractors after two years' worth of discussions, though the Ireland family kept ownership of the site. At this time, Williams & Griffin's turnover was valued at ¬£400,000. In 1981, however, the decision was reversed and Williams & Griffin opened a garden centre on the site under the guidance of Patrick Ireland, which ran until 1990, when the site was finally sold off. The main site in Colchester High Street, as pictured in December 2009 and using the Williams & Griffin branding. In 2007, Williams & Griffin won \\"Best Independent Department Store of the Year\\", sponsored by Drapers. The award was picked up by Colchester's MP, Bob Russell, who proposed an early day motion on the topic. It remained in the control of the Ireland family until its sale in March 2008 to the Fenwick chain of department stores. Current departments include fashion, toys, gifts, housewares and furniture, as well as a top-floor restaurant. In 2015, it announced that, following a major redevelopment of its site, it would rebrand under the new Fenwick name, becoming Fenwick Colchester.

He headed the Norwegian Polar Institute from 1960 to 1983, and played an important role in the Norwegian resistance during World War II. Personal life Gjelsvik was born in Bodin as the son of Eystein Gjelsvik and Lina Relling. He finished his examen artium at Oslo Cathedral School in 1936, and started thereafter studying at the University of Oslo. He graduated in 1942. He married Anne Marie Skaven in 1945. World War II Being a student in Oslo at the outbreak of World War II, Gjelsvik participated in the resistance movement from 1940. By that time he had already participated in the Norwegian Campaign. He was among the editors and producers of the magazine Bulletinen, one of the first underground newspapers, and this consumed much of his time. He was among the initiators of the first intelligence groups, and had contacts with the leaders of XU. Gjelsvik became a member of the Coordination Committee ( (KK)) in 1943, a central coordinating organ for the civil branch of the resistance. According to one historian, students of natural sciences were well-suited for intelligence work, as they were practically oriented and used to working in the field. Leading members of XU, such as Astrid L√∏ken, were natural scientists at the University of Oslo. He has documented the Norwegian resistance in his book from 1977, Hjemmefronten. Den sivile motstand under okkupasjonen 1940‚Äì45, based on personal knowledge and experience. Postwar career Gjelsvik took the dr. philos. degree in 1953 on the thesis Metamorphosed Dolerites in the Gneiss Area of Sunnm√∏re on the West Coast of Southern Norway. He worked as a geologist from 1952 to 1959, and also worked for the United Nations. In 1960 he was appointed manager for the Norwegian Polar Institute, a position he held until his retirement in 1983. He participated in Polar research, as a member of several committees, such as Det interdepartementale Polarutvalg and Polarr√•det. He chaired the geographical society Det norske geografiske selskap from 1963 to 1965, and the geological society Norsk Geologisk Forening from 1963 to 1964. He took part in the developing Norway's Resistance Museum, chairing its advisory board from 1964 to 1973, and was a member of the Fram committee from 1960 to 1997.

Their teachings are also known as \\"Dunovism\\", after the founder. The group proposes a Christian esoterism characterized by a number of practices, including prayer, meditation, breathing exercises, yoga of nutrition and paneurhythmy. A person can be both member of the group and of another religion. In France, the group achieved notability in the media in 1971. It has two centers located in S√®vres and Fr√©jus and 2,000 followers in France, and is present in many countries, including Canada, Switzerland and Belgium. The 1995 and 1999 reports established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France, as well as the 1997 reports issued by the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission in Belgium listed the group as a cult. The main criticisms by anti-cult associations are the alleged harmful effects of the doctrine on the psyche of some followers, the diet that can lead to nutritional deficiencies, and the authoritarian nature of education.  Explanation of Name  ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù refers to humans‚Äô ability to understand universal concepts about life. It speaks to the idea that people can expand their consciousness with these concepts that extend to more than just one person or group. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù does not refer to a person's race, rather, it is, ‚Äúthe highest spiritual symbol, which is the synthesis of all colors, being the manifestations of the soul‚Äôs virtues.\\" ‚ÄúBrotherhood‚Äù is meant to indicate that the Universal White Brotherhood's teachings are for every human no matter what community, religion, or group they belong to. The Universal White Brotherhood believes that their teachings are for everyone so that they can expand their consciousness and embrace a virtuous spirituality.  Beliefs   Solarcentrism  The Universal White Brotherhood believes in centering oneself around the sun, which contributes to their practice of Surya Yoga. They believe that meditating at sunrise offers a host of physical and spiritual benefits. According to the movement, this practice has value given that the Earth and therefore human beings revolve around the sun.  Brotherhood  The Universal White Brotherhood believes that universal brotherhood is ‚Äúthe only solution to the problems of humanity.‚Äù This brotherhood is described as ‚Äúhuman beings work[ing] together no longer exclusively for themselves, but for the whole world.‚Äù This stems from the belief that all people are children of a universal Creator.  Dualism of Human Nature  The Universal White Brotherhood teaches ‚Äúthat all human beings possess two natures, a human nature and a divine nature.‚Äù The human nature ‚Äúis composed of the physical and etheric body ‚Ä¶ the astral body ‚Ä¶ [and] the mental body,‚Äù and the divine body ‚Äúconsists of the Causal body ‚Ä¶ or divine wisdom ‚Ä¶ the Budhic body [which] is formed of all our purest, most noble feelings ‚Ä¶ [and] the Atmic body [or] the higher will.‚Äù The UWB believes that humans should identify with their divine nature.  Divinity of Art  This is the belief that all human beings are naturally creative, but that art ought to be inspired by the divine rather than by the human. Within UWB thought, humans are considered to be works of art, and perfecting oneself is seen act of creativity.  Spiritual Work  The UWB teaches that ‚Äúspiritual work is a matter of developing the divine part of yourself which in ordinary life is bullied and smothered by all kinds of occupations and worries...Learn to establish order and harmony in yourself, allow your divine nature to blossom in the light and love.‚Äù This is accomplished by ‚Äúbring[ing] heaven into [one‚Äôs] physical body,‚Äù for example by means of eating, breathing exercises, and prayer.  Methods and Practices  Six of the major methods used by the Universal White Brotherhood to practice and reinforce their beliefs include: meditation, music and singing, eating in silence, respiration, spiritual gymnastics, and paneurhythmy. While each of these are different, they all possess the element of meditation and reflection that allow the practitioner to embrace their environment, connect with their community, and further understand their spiritual being.  Meditation  The Master calls meditation ‚ÄúSurya Yoga‚Äù or ‚ÄúYoga of the Sun‚Äù and it is a method that all disciples are encouraged to practice because it is at the heart of the teachings. Meditation is practiced between the Spring and Autumn equinoxes at sunrise. Sunrise is important because it is a time of renewal when the sun's rays help to transform and renew meditators. In meditation, the practitioner concentrates their thoughts and forces on the sun to reinforce their connection with their spirit. Just as the sun is the center of the solar system, through meditation practitioners connect with their spirit, the center of their being. Meditation allows paths of communication to be established through bridges between people's higher and lower natures. There is also meditation with music and laser meditation. Meditation with music is when brotherhood centers hold collective meditations that start with 10‚Äì15 minutes of inspirational music. This music is thought to help practitioners relax and to stimulate the imagination leading to an enrichment of spiritual life and good will. Laser meditation is when everyone concentrates on a single image during intense and silent meditation. People are united at this time and even vibrate on the same wavelength.  Music and Singing  Meetings begin with the singing of three sacred songs that were composed by Peter Deunov. Master Omraam says that music is a way to harmonize one's being with the rest of the community. It helps to establish unity between people and to purify the atmosphere to ‚Äúdisintegrate the darkness‚Äù. Through song, people are able to transform themselves. While singing, people should concentrate on what they need or want, like health or intelligence, and in the future they might find that they can find these things within themselves.  Eating in Silence  Practitioners eat in silence so they are able to meditate on how their food is grown in nature and by the Creator. By avoiding conversation and focusing on the food, people are able to love their food so that they are able to receive all of its treasures. The idea is that if you love the food you are eating, you will gain more from the experience.  Respiration  The Brotherhood uses nostril breathing exercises that are often found in Hatha Yoga tradition. Breathing is considered a form of nutrition and to fully take in these nutritions, people must hold the air in their lungs. Through respiration, people also draw in forces of light and peace from the world. These methods are used to develop ‚Äúinner qualities, strengthen the will, calm the nervous system and vitalize the body.\\"  Spiritual Gymnastics  There are six exercise that when performed form an ‚Äúinner request‚Äù. The exercises take the shape of gentle and flowing movements and by concentrating on specific movements, people are able to calm their nervous system and create inner harmony. These exercises can also be used to ask for spiritual blessings and to develop individual qualities of balance, vitality, health, and purity. These gymnastics allow people to create balance between themselves and nature that ultimately results in better health.  Paneurhythmy  Paneurhythmy refers to a circle dance, which was created by Peter Deunov and he referred to it as ‚Äúthe supreme cosmic rhythm‚Äù. Through this dance people are able to harmonize with the rhythms of the universe. Omraam said, ‚Äúdancing the paneurhythmy enables you to learn to adapt your thoughts, your sentiments and your actions to the most harmonious rhythms of nature.\\" References External links * Official site * Site of the official Bulgarian White Brotherhood Category:Religious organizations established in the 20th century Category:New religious movements Category:Esoteric Christianity Category:Christianity in Bulgaria Category:Christianity in France ","title":"Universal White Brotherhood"},{"id":"24201949","text":"Gwangajeong is an old hanok, or Korean traditional house located in Yangdong village, Gangdong-myeon, Gyeongju, South Korea.

Beginning on 20 August 1918, he added two more enemy aircraft and two more observation balloons to his tally by month's end. That made him a double ace, with ten victories, and a balloon ace, with six. H√∂hn in command Towards the end of the month, H√∂hn had a fleeting assignment as commander of Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 81 that lasted until 3 September. He shot down a Spad on both 2 and 3 September. For the rest of the month of September 1918, H√∂hn was the acting commander of Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 60. While with them, he scored two Spads and four more balloons.Franks, VanWyngarden 2004, p. 49. He then was given command of Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 41. He scored each of the first three days of October 1918, running his total to 21. He was killed in action on 3 October 1918. His Fokker D.VII was downed by a member of French squadron Spa67. Neither his dual rear view mirrors nor his teddy bear mascot saved him.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 77. H√∂hn's final victory total was ten balloons and eleven airplanes. If he had survived, he would have been eligible for the German Empire's highest honor for valor, the Pour le Merite, upon confirmation of his 20th victory.http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Retrieved 22 February 2013.

History Originally Mac Gaibhide the name was Anglicized to Gaffey in the 17th century. There has been confusion about the origins of the Gaffey name, some people believing that the name came from England or Scotland and moved to Ulster during the Ulster plantation and moved again to Connacht in the wake of the O'Donnells. This has been disproven as they did not come from Donegal nor did they settle in north Connacht like other Ulster families. A poet named O'Dugan wrote in \\"The Topographical Poem\\" of a sept called Mac Gaibhidh, describing their location as a \\"land of fruit\\" it was clearly not the west or north of Connacht but instead the southern Roscommon area. It is thought that the Gaffeys are descendants of Vikings who sailed down the River Shannon and settled near the Viking town, Athlone . The name Mac Gaibhidhe comes from the Irish \\"mac an gabha\\" which translates to \\"Son of the Smith\\" . Irish people called Vikings \\"The Blacksmiths\\" for their skills at iron work and it is believed that this is where the Gaffey name originates. There is more confusion to the name Gaffey as not all Gaffeys are from the original Mc Gaibhidhe name. some small branches of the Gaffney family moved from Britain to Connacht during some unknown point of time and converted their name to Gaffey as they hibernicized. And Gaffeys that moved to Scotland and Australia changed their names to Gaffney. And the name Gaffey and Hackett (surname) have such similar coat of arms that they are often confused with each other by heraldry websites. Coat of arms The Gaffey coat of arms is a white chief containing three green shamrocks or trefoils symbolising peace, authority and perpetuity, the rest of the shield is Royal blue (azure) containing three fish (vertical) symbolising loyalty and virtue. The motto of the Gaffey family is \\"Fortitudine et prudentia\\" meaning Courage and Caution. The family colors of the Gaffey family are royal blue and white as shown by their mantle. and their crest is a golden crown below a double-headed eagle supporting two serpents lifting a tiara. People Notable people with the surname include: *Hugh Joseph Gaffey (1895‚Äì1946), Chief of Staff for General George Patton's Third Army during World War II *John Tracy Gaffey (1860‚Äì1935), a journalist, state and city official, real-estate speculator and investor at the turn of the 20th century in Los Angeles, California. *Michael Gaffey (1893‚Äì1961), the police chief of San Francisco between 1951 and 1955 *Michael James Gaffey, planetary scientist who specializes in deriving the mineralogies of asteroids from their reflectance spectra *Nigel Gaffey (b. 1970), Australian rugby league footballer *Thomas Gaffey, American politician, state senator from Connecticut since 1995 See also *3545 Gaffey (1981 WK2), a Main-belt Asteroid discovered in 1981 Sources *\\"Supplement Irish families\\" by Edward MacLysaght M.A, D.Litt. , M.R.I.A *\\"Historic Families\\" Aston house, Dublin Category:Irish families Category:Surnames of Irish origin Category:Occupational surnames ","title":"Gaffey"},{"id":"24201998","text":"The chapel of Keble College, Oxford Keble College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in memory of the Anglican clergyman John Keble, who died in 1866, and was intended to cater for men whose financial resources were insufficient to enable them to study at one of the older Oxford colleges. After a public appeal for donations in John Keble's memory, the college opened in 1870. The college's buildings ‚Äì which were quite unlike any previous Oxford college, with their use of coloured bricks in patterns ‚Äì were designed by William Butterfield; there have been later additions as the college has grown. The Governing Body of the college has the ability to elect \\"distinguished persons\\" to Honorary Fellowships.Statute VI \\"The Fellows\\", clause 13 Under the current statutes of the college, Honorary Fellows cannot vote at meetings of the Governing Body and do not receive financial reward, but they receive \\"such other privileges as the Governing Body may determine.\\" They can be called upon to help decide whether to dismiss or discipline members of academic staff (including the Warden of the college).Statute XIV \\"Academic Staff\\", clauses 11, 16, 29 and 42 The first four Honorary Fellows were elected in 1931. Two of them (Edward Talbot and Walter Lock) were former Wardens of the college; the other two, Sir Wilmot Herringham (a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London) and Sir Reginald Craddock (a former Lieutenant-Governor of Burma), had studied at Keble College before achieving prominence in public life. Honorary Fellows have included former students (Old Members), Fellows, and Wardens, as well as some with no previous academic connection to the college. In this latter group there are benefactors (for example Sir Anthony O'Reilly, elected 2002), and individuals of distinction such as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan (elected 1994) and the poet Sir John Betjeman (elected 1972). Betjeman, who studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, was involved in Keble's centenary appeal in 1970: The Times said in its obituary of him that the Honorary Fellowship was particularly appropriate because of the college's \\"architectural and Anglican connotations\\", Betjeman having strong interests in both areas. As of July 2011, the longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Raoul Franklin and Dennis Nineham, both of whom were elected in 1980. The three longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Sir John Forsdyke (Principal Librarian of the British Museum; appointed 1937, died 1979), Sir Thomas Armstrong (conductor; appointed 1955, died 1994) and Harry Carpenter (Warden, later Bishop of Oxford; appointed 1960, died 1993). Honorary Fellows The abbreviations used in the \\"Link\\" column denote the person's connection with the college before election as an Honorary Fellow: *C ‚Äì A member of the college council: the Warden and Council governed the college between 6 June 1870 (the date of incorporation) and 9 April 1952 (the date when the college's statutes were amended to make the college self-governing with control passing to the Warden and Fellows). *F ‚Äì A former Fellow of the college *OM ‚Äì An Old Member of the college *W ‚Äì A former Warden of the college A dash denotes that the person had no previous academic link with the college. Lord Adonis, appointed an Honorary Fellow in 2008 Ed Balls, appointed an Honorary Fellow in 2008 Sir John Betjeman, appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1972 Ronald Reagan, appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1994 Imran Khan, the cricketer and politician, became an Honorary Fellow in 1988.

The film was directed by Lewis D. Collins and is based on the 1929 play \\"For the Sake of the Family\\" by Charles Webb and Daniel Brown. Made by Pathe Industries for release by the Producers Releasing Corporation. The film was later picked up for distribution by Eagle-Lion Films after PRC's demise. It was one of several films of the time depicting fraudulent spiritualism such as Nightmare Alley (1947), The Spiritualist (1948) and London Belongs to Me (1948). Plot Henry Elkins (Stu Erwin) has been left a large parcel of land by his father and grandfather in what is now the eastern part of the city of Elkinsville. Having been told never to sell the property by his ancestors, Henry has refused several lucrative offers wanting to purchase the land for a cemetery, incinerator or the city dump in favour of wishing to develop a housing estate. Henry lives with his wife Nora Elkins (Glenda Farrell) who passionately believes in a fraudulent Swami who conducts seances, a snappy housekeeper (Irene Ryan), a lazy brother in law (George O'Hanlon), a daughter and a cat who all give him problems, Henry dreams the land will someday bring him both great fortune and self-respect. Henry's life changes when he overhears information about one of his Doctor's patients who is terminally ill that he thinks is his own diagnosis when he goes for a physical for an insurance policy. He agrees to sell his land to an airline wishing to build an airport giving his wife and family the money as a legacy but several people in Elkinsville attempt to give Henry fraudulent information to lower his price or intend to acquire it for themselves. One of them uses the swami to convince Henry to sell the land to them who will then sell it to the airlines for a profit for themselves. Surrounded by problems Henry goes to a peaceful lake to meditate. He falls asleep where nightmares wake him up causing him to fall in the water. As he is drying his clothes they also fall in the water and float away leading policemen who find his clothes containing a note to his wife that Henry has taken his own life. Henry's return to his home is delayed when he has to steal the clothes of a scarecrow leading him to a pair of hoboes who befriend him and get him drunk. He returns in time to find a real representative from the airline making Henry a direct substantial offer for his property that will include a housing estate, but first Henry decides to teach the swindlers and his gullible family a lesson by crashing a seance they have planned.

Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over the each hell. Naraka (Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§∞‡§ï) is the realm of existence in Jain cosmology characterized by great suffering. Naraka is usually translated into English as \\"hell\\" or \\"purgatory\\". Naraka differs from the hells of Abrahamic religions as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long‚Äîmeasured in billions of years. A soul is reborn into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous karma (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened. Types of hells These realms are situated in the seven lower levels (adho lok) of the universe while the human abode of Jambudvip is in the middle (madhya lok) and the heavenly realms exist above (urdhva loka). These layers together, form the shape of a man with arms akimbo (the familiar 'keyhole' shaped emblem of Jainism), with the human realm of Jambudvip at the waist, adho lok below, urdhva lok above, and siddha lok or siddhashila (the realm of the siddhas) at or above the head. Many Jain temples are built to display this cosmology such Jambudvip in Hastinapur and the fifteen story Trilok Teerth Dham temple in Uttar Pradesh. The seven lower grounds are: # Ratna prabha. # Sharkara prabha. # Valuka prabha. # Panka prabha. # Dhuma prabha. # Tamaha prabha. # Mahatamaha prabha. The first ground, owing to a predominance of ratnas or jewels, is called Ratnaprabha. Similarly, the second, owing to a predominance of sarkara or gravel, is called Sarkraprabha. The third owing to a predominance of valuka or sands, is called Valukaprabha. The fourth, owing to an excess of panka or mud, is called Pankaprabha. The fifth, owing to an excess of dhuma or smoke, is called Dhumaprabha. The sixth, owing to a marked possession of tamas or darkness, is called Tamahprabha, while the seventh, owing to a high concentration of mahatamas or dense darkness, is called Mahatamahprabha. Hellish beings The hellish beings (, ') are a type of soul which reside in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation. pp. 107 The hellish beings each possess a vaikriya body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span in the respective hells where they reside. The minimum life span of hellish beings in the first to seventh hellish grounds is 10000 years, 1 sagaropama year (Ocean-measured years which are countless years as per Jain cosmology),As per the Jain cosmology Sirsapahelika is the highest measurable number in Jainism which is 10^194 years. Higher than that is palyopama (pit measured years) which is explained by an analogy of a pit. Accordingly, a hollow pit of 8 x 8 x 8 miles tightly filled with hair particles of seven day old newly born. [A single hair from the above cut into eight pieces seven times = 2,097,152 Particles]. 1 Particle emptied after every 100 years, the time taken to empty the whole pit = 1 Palyopama. (1 Palyopama = countless years.) Hence palyopama is at least greater than 10^194 years. Sagrapoma is 10 Quadrillion Palyopama, that means a Sagrapoma is more than 10^210 Years 3 sagaropama years, 7 sagaropama years, 10 sagaropama years, 17 sagaropama years and 22 sagaropama years respectively. The maximum life span of hellish beings in the first to sixth hellish grounds is 1 sagaropama year, 3 sagaropama years, 7 sagaropama years, 10 sagaropama years, 17 sagaropama years and 22 sagaropama years respectively. They experience five types of sufferings: bodily pain, inauspicious le≈õyƒÅ or soul colouring and pari·πáƒÅma or physical transformation, from the nature and location of hells, pain inflicted on one other and torture inflicted by mansion-dwelling demi-gods. Causes of birth in Hell In a dialogue between Sudharma Swami and Mahavira in the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira speaks of various reasons a soul may take birth in hells: verse SK:5.1.1-6 : Sudharma Swami: What is the punishment in the hells? Knowing it, O sage, tell it me who do not know it! How do sinners go to hell? : Mahavira: I shall describe the truly insupportable pains where there is distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings for the sake of his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going to a place like a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt they cry horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud. According to Jain scripture, Tattvarthasutra, following are the causes for birth in hell:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52 #Killing or causing pain with intense passion. #Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts. #Vowless and unrestrained life.refer Mahavrata for the vows and restraints in Jainism Description of tortures of hell Tortures in the hells In a dialogue between Sudharma and Mahavira the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira describes various tortures and sufferings in hells: :They cross the horrible Vaitarani, being urged on by arrows, and wounded with spears. The punishers pierce them with darts; they go in the boat, losing their memory; others pierce them with long pikes and tridents, and throw them on the ground. Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambav√¢luk√¢ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it. And they come to the great impassable hell, full of agony, called As√ªrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing. There, as in a cave, being roasted on the fire, he is burned, having lost the reminiscence (of his sins) and consciousness of everything else; always suffering (he comes) to that miserable hot place that is ever ready (for the punishment of evildoers) There the cruel punishers have lighted four fires, and roast the sinners; they are roasted there like fishes put on the fire alive. :The prisoners in hell come to the dreadful place called Santakshana (i.e. cutting), where the cruel punishers tie their hands and feet, and with axes in their hands cut them like wooden planks. And they turn the writhing victims round, and stew them, like living fishes, in an iron caldron filled with their own blood, their limbs covered with ordure, their heads smashed. In Hell beings have a life span of innumerable years and are not easily killed even though they endure great torture. Even if they are killed they immediately take birth and are then repeatedly killed. This is described as thus: :They are not reduced to ashes there, and they do not die of their enormous pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished). :They deprive the sinner of his life; I shall truly tell you how this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) punishment (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) for the sake of small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.

In static semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence amounts to knowing when it is true; in dynamic semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence means knowing \\"the change it brings about in the information state of anyone who accepts the news conveyed by it.\\" In dynamic systems, sentences are mapped to functions called context change potentials which take an input context and return an output context. Dynamic semantics was originally developed by Irene Heim and Hans Kamp in 1981 to model anaphora, but has since been applied widely to phenomena including presupposition, plurals, questions, discourse relations, and modality.  Dynamics of anaphora  The first systems of dynamic semantics were the closely related File Change Semantics and discourse representation theory, developed simultaneously and independently by Irene Heim and Hans Kamp. These systems were intended to capture donkey anaphora, which resists an elegant compositional treatment in classic approaches to semantics such as Montague grammar. Donkey anaphora is exemplified by the infamous donkey sentences, first noticed by the medieval logician Walter Burley and brought to modern attention by Peter Geach. ::Donkey sentence (relative clause): Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it. ::Donkey sentence (conditional): If a farmer owns a donkey, he beats it. To capture the empirically observed truth conditions of such sentences in first order logic, one would need to translate the indefinite noun phrase \\"a donkey\\" as a universal quantifier scoping over the variable corresponding to the pronoun \\"it\\". :: FOL Translation of Donkey Sentence: : \\\\forall x \\\\forall y (\\\\,(\\\\text{farmer} (x) \\\\land \\\\text{donkey}(y) \\\\land \\\\text{own}(x,y)) \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{beat}(x,y)\\\\,) While this translation captures (or approximates) the truth conditions of the natural language sentences, its relationship to the syntactic form of the sentence is puzzling in two ways. First, indefinites in non-donkey contexts normally express existential rather than universal quantification. Second, the syntactic position of the donkey pronoun would not normally allow it to be bound by the indefinite. To explain these peculiarities, Heim and Kamp proposed that natural language indefinites are special in that they introduce a new discourse referent which remains available outside the syntactic scope of the operator that introduced it. To cash this idea out, they proposed their respective formal systems which capture donkey anaphora because they validate Egli's Theorem and its corollary. ::Egli's Theorem: (\\\\exists x \\\\varphi) \\\\land \\\\psi \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\exists x (\\\\varphi \\\\land \\\\psi) ::Egli's Corolary: (\\\\exists x \\\\phi \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi) \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\forall x(\\\\phi \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi )  Update semantics  Update semantics is a framework within dynamic semantics which was developed by Frank Veltman. In Update Semantics, each formula \\\\varphi is mapped to a function [\\\\varphi] which takes and returns a discourse context. Thus, if C is a context, then C[\\\\varphi] is the context one gets by updating C with \\\\varphi . Systems of Update Semantics vary both in how they define a context and in the semantic entries they assign to formulas. The simplest update systems are intersective ones, which simply lift static systems into the dynamic framework. However, Update Semantics includes systems more expressive than what can be defined in the static framework. In particular, it allows information sensitive semantic entries, in which the information contributed by updating with some formula can depend on the information already present in the context. This property of Update Semantics has led to its widespread application to presuppositions, modals, and conditionals.  Intersective update  An update with \\\\varphi is called intersective if it amounts to taking the intersection of the input context with the proposition denoted by \\\\varphi. Crucially, this definition assumes that there is a single fixed proposition that \\\\varphi always denotes, regardless of the context. * Intersective update: Let [\\\\\\\\![\\\\varphi]\\\\\\\\!] be the proposition denoted by \\\\varphi. Then \\\\varphi is intersective iff for any C , we have that C[\\\\varphi] = C \\\\cap [\\\\\\\\![\\\\varphi]\\\\\\\\!] Intersective update was proposed by Robert Stalnaker in 1978 as a way of formalizing the speech act of assertion. In Stalnaker's original system, a context (or context set) is defined as a set of possible worlds representing the information in the common ground of a conversation. For instance, if C = \\\\\\\\{w,v,u\\\\\\\\} this represents a scenario where the information agreed upon by all participants in the conversation indicates that the actual world must be either w, v, or u. If [\\\\\\\\![\\\\varphi]\\\\\\\\!] = \\\\\\\\{w,v\\\\\\\\}, then updating C with \\\\varphi would return a new context C[\\\\varphi] = \\\\\\\\{w,v\\\\\\\\}. Thus, an assertion of \\\\varphi would be understood as an attempt to rule out the possibility that the actual world is u . From a formal perspective, intersective update can be taken as a recipe for lifting one's preferred static semantics to dynamic semantics. For instance, if we take classical propositional semantics as our starting point, this recipe delivers the following intersective update semantics. * Intersective update semantics based on classical propositional logic: # C[P] = \\\\\\\\{w \\\\in C \\\\mid w(P) = 1 \\\\\\\\} # C[ eg \\\\varphi] = C - C[\\\\varphi] # C[\\\\varphi \\\\land \\\\psi] = C[\\\\varphi] \\\\cap C[\\\\psi] # C[\\\\varphi \\\\lor \\\\psi] = C[\\\\varphi] \\\\cup C[\\\\psi] The notion of intersectivity can be decomposed into the two properties known as eliminativity and distributivity. Eliminativity says that an update can only ever remove worlds from the context-- it can't add them. Distributivity says that updating C with \\\\varphi is equivalent to updating each singleton subset of C with \\\\varphi and then pooling the results. * Eliminativity: \\\\varphi is eliminative iff C[\\\\varphi] \\\\subseteq C for all contexts C * Distributivity: \\\\varphi is distributive iff C[\\\\varphi] = \\\\bigcup\\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{w\\\\\\\\}[\\\\varphi] \\\\mid w \\\\in C\\\\\\\\} Intersectivity amounts to the conjunction of these two properties, as proven by Johan van Benthem.  The test semantics for modals  The framework of update semantics is more general than static semantics because it is not limited to nonintersective meanings. Nonintersective meanings are theoretically useful because they contribute different information depending on what information is already present in the context. For instance, if \\\\varphi is intersective, then it will update any input context with the exact same information, namely the information encoded by the proposition [\\\\\\\\![\\\\varphi]\\\\\\\\!]. On the other hand, if \\\\varphi is nonintersective, it could contribute [\\\\\\\\![\\\\varphi]\\\\\\\\!] when it updates some contexts, but some completely different information when it updates other contexts. Many natural language expressions have been argued to have nonintersective meanings. The nonintersectivity of epistemic modals can be seen in the infelicity of epistemic contradictions. :Epistemic contradiction: #It's raining and it might not be raining. These sentences have been argued to be bona fide logical contradictions, unlike superficially similar examples such as Moore sentences which can be given a pragmatic explanation. :Epistemic contradiction principle: \\\\varphi \\\\land \\\\Diamond eg \\\\varphi \\\\models \\\\bot These sentences cannot be analysed as logical contradictions within purely intersective frameworks such as the relational semantics for modal logic. The Epistemic Contradiction Principle only holds on the class of relational frames such that Rwv \\\\Rightarrow (w=v) . However, such frames also validate an entailment from \\\\Diamond \\\\varphi to \\\\varphi. Thus, accounting for the infelicity of epistemic contradictions within a classical semantics for modals would bring along the unwelcome prediction that \\"It might be raining\\" entails \\"It is raining\\". Update Semantics skirts this problem by providing a nonintersective denotation for modals. When given such a denotation, the formula \\\\Diamond eg \\\\varphi can update input contexts differently depending on whether they already contain the information that \\\\varphi provides. The most widely adopted semantic entry for modals in update semantics is the test semantics proposed by Frank Veltman. *The test semantics for modals: C[\\\\Diamond \\\\varphi ] = \\\\begin{cases} C & \\\\text{if } C[\\\\varphi] eq \\\\varnothing \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varnothing & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} On this semantics, \\\\Diamond \\\\varphi tests whether the input context could be updated with \\\\varphi without getting trivialized, i.e. without returning the empty set. If the input context passes the test, it remains unchanged. If it fails the test, the update trivializes the context by returning the empty set.

The building lies near the Vatican City, is attached and adjacent to the Collegio Teutonico, and the German Teutonic Cemetery in the Vatican City. The site belonged to the Schola Francorum, a hospice for German pilgrims which was the oldest German institution in Rome.Official website of the Vatican City, Teutonic Cemetery The church, lying in piazza Protomartiri Romani, is in the area of the Palazzo del Sant'Uffizo, which belongs to Italy but according to the Lateran treaty has an extraterritorial status in favour of the Holy See. The term \\"Teutonico\\" is a reference to the Germanic peoples. The church is the National Church in Rome of Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.  History  In 796 Charlemagne, by permission of Pope Leo III, founded on ground adjoining this spot a hospice for pilgrims, which was intended for the people of his empire. In connection with the hospice was a church dedicated to the Saviour and a graveyard for the burial of the subjects of Charlemagne who died in Rome. From the beginning, this foundation was placed under the care of the ecclesiastical authorities of St Peter's. The decline, soon after this period, of the Carolingian empire, brought the hospice, the Schola Francorum, entirely under the jurisdiction of the basilica; at the same time, the original intent of a place for pilgrims and the poor was preserved. In the complete ruin which overtook Rome during the Avignon Papacy (1309‚Äì1378), and during the following decades of the Western Schism, the ecclesiastical foundations in the vicinity of St. Peter's sank into decay.Waal, Anton de. \\"Campo Santo de' Tedeschi.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 April 2020 After the return of the popes, new life sprang up, and the enthusiasm for building and endowing foundations in the Borgo was rekindled under Popes Martin V, Eugenius IV, and Nicholas V. The remembrance of Charlemagne and his hospice revived in the mind of the large and influential German colony then residing at Rome, and during the reign of Martin V (1417‚Äì1431) the enlarged cemetery was surrounded with a wall built by Fredericus Alemannus, who also erected a house for its guardians. During the plague outbreak of 1448, Johannis Assonensis, a German confessor attached to St. Peter's and later Bishop of Wurzburg, assembled his countrymen there and founded among them a brotherhood, the object of which was to provide suitable burial for all poor Germans dying in Rome. When the Holy Year 1450 brought many pilgrims to Rome, the brotherhood built a church, a new hospice for German pilgrims on the adjoining land, and developed the Campo Santo into a German national institution. In the 15th, 16th, and even in the 19th century the German nation was represented at Rome by numerous officials at the papal court and by guilds of German bakers, shoemakers, and weavers; in these ages Germans were to be found in every industry of ordinary life, and German bankers and inn-keepers were especially numerous. Nevertheless, the steadily decreasing German population of Rome during the 17th and 18th centuries caused the Campo Santo, as a national foundation, and the brotherhood to sink into neglect. The church was progressively eclipsed by the church of Saint Maria dell' Anima. In 1876 Pope Pius IX founded a seminary for German-speaking priests for the special study of archaeology and church history to replace the Schola Francorum. Today, the church is still an important gathering place for the German- speaking community in Rome. Description The present church was built in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. Access to the Church (from the cemetery) is through a portal by sculptor Elmar Hillebrand of Cologne, given in 1957 by the President of the Republic of Germany Theodor Heuss.\\"Campo Santo Teutonico\\", Stato Della Citt√† del Vaticano During the Sack of Rome (1527), the Swiss Guard made their last stand in the Teutonic Cemetery, holding off the invading troops long enough for Pope Clement VII to escape over the Passetto di Borgo to Castel Sant'Angelo. The Chapel of the Swiss served as a burial place for the fallen guards. A guide from the early 19th century mentions a main altarpiece depicting a Deposition by Polidoro di Caravaggio, flanked by painting by Giacinto d'Hasse. This latter painter's tomb monument, located inside the church, was sculpted by Francois Duquesnoy. The lateral altars housed a St Erasmus by Giacinto Gimignani and Epiphany by Scarsellino; the altar dedicated to St Charles Borromeo had an altarpiece depicting the Flight to Egypt by Arrigo Fiammingo; St John Nepomunk by Ignazio Stern; and the sacristy held an Immaculate Conception by Luigi Garzi.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 442.

The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p68Kaplan, David, \\"Leo Camron\\", obituary in the magazine of Telfed (the Israeli South African Association), March, 2008. Available online at http://www.telfed.org.il/files/mag_march08/28-48.pdf Early life Leo Camron's original family name was \\"Caminsky\\". Camron graduated from Natal University and also played for the Natal rugby team. He later became an artillery captain in the South African Army, and served in the North African campaigns of World War II. In 1948, Camron left his pregnant wife Hazel and two small children (Jo-Anne and David) in South Africa, and went to Palestine to join Machal and fight in the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. He returned to South Africa several days before the birth of his 3rd child, Sharon. The entire family emigrated to Israel in 1951 and remained there until the end of 1956, after the Sinai War. They returned to South Africa where a 4th child was born - Alon. The family went back to Israel in 1961 and settled in Ramat Hasharon. The family adopted a Hebrew surname, Camron and Leo changed his first name to Arieh, which means 'lion' in Hebrew. His wife Hazel, changed her name to Aliza. English teaching In Israel, he became an English teacher, and made a pioneering contribution to its teaching to students there. He was the author of several English grammar books used by successive generations of Israeli school children. Rugby Camron succeeded in obtaining an appointment in the sports department of the IDF in 1951.Israel tries to revive HolyLand 7s on Rugby7 dot com, retrieved 2 September 2009 In 1952, Camron organised independent Israel's first rugby match, between a group of South Africans, and a team of parachutists in the IDF. The South Africans won 18-6. The match ball was somewhat unusual, being a shoe wrapped in a towel. The game proved fairly popular in the IDF, thanks partly to its emphasis on aggression and team tactics. Camron soon organised other games, mainly between soldiers, and immigrants from the British Commonwealth. Rugby had been played in Israel before, but had more or less died out with the departure of the British. Camron made an attempt to get the IDF to adopt the game, but was unsuccessful due to institutional bureaucracy. This was a bitter blow to his campaign, and led to him taking a more passive role in Israeli rugby until its revival by another group of South African immigrants in the 1970s. Cricket and lawn bowls Camron was also a keen supporter of cricket and lawn bowls in Israel. Like rugby, cricket had been played in Palestine during the British Mandate period, but had declined suddenly when Israel became independent. Camron was a member of the original Israel cricket team in 1956.2002 ICA AWARD WINNERS , retrieved 2 September 2009 He was a founder member of the Israel Cricket Association, and gave out the medals at the 2002 ICA Awards.

Rescue) is a 1947 American film directed by William H. Pine and starring Richard Denning, Catherine Craig and Russell Hayden. The film's opening title says: \\"This film is dedicated to the men of the AAF Air-sea rescue service, who risk their lives daily that others may live.\\" Seven Were Saved was the first of a number of films that dramatized survival at sea after an aircraft crash.Paris 1995, p. 200. Plot In 1945, several months after the end of World War II, Army nurse Susan Briscoe is taking an amnesia victim, who was imprisoned by the Japanese, to the United States via transport aircraft, piloted by Captain Allen Danton. The passengers include the Japanese Colonel Yamura, who is on his way to Manila to face war crime charges. Also on board is a couple, the Hartleys, who were married on the day they were liberated from a Japanese prison camp. During the flight, the colonel tricks a guard and breaks away from his guards, grabbing a gun and shooting a crew member and the co-pilot. The colonel struggles with Allen at the controls and causes the aircraft to plummet into the sea. Once the aircraft is declared missing, Air-Sea Rescue pilot Captain Jim Willis, Susan's fianc√©, begins a desperate search over the Pacific Ocean. He flies countless missions until, running a fever due to malaria, he is grounded. The eight survivors of the crash have managed to inflate a life raft. After carefully assessing their situation, Allen, who has suffered a head wound, declares that they may have to attempt the 600-mile journey to the nearest island while hoping for rescue. In the first day at sea, Mrs. Hartley realizes that the amnesia victim, called Mr. Smith, is really her former husband, Philip Thompson, who was thought to be dead. The Hartleys now face a dilemma as they may not be married legally. During the evening of the third day, Smith slips overboard without anyone noticing, but suspicion is cast on Mr. Hartley, who was supposed to be on watch. In the ensuing argument fomented by Yamura, the boat capsizes and the seven survivors fight for their lives in the ocean. After losing the sail and oars, the survivors realize that without food or water, their chances for survival are slim. When repairing a leak with chewing gum, Sergeant Blair is attacked by a shark, but Lt. Martin Pinkert jumps into the water to distract the shark and allow Blair to get back onto the raft. On the fifth day, Susan discovers Allen is blind from exposure to the sun, and the two conspire to keep the raft drifting on course. Air-Sea Rescue is about to cancel further searches when Jim sneaks onto a Boeing SB-17G \\"Dumbo\\". He locates the survivors, dropping a motorized boat nearby, but the seven in the raft are too emaciated and weak to paddle to the boat. Jim parachutes into the water, inflates a small raft and then steers the rescue boat to the life boat, eventually bringing everyone on board to safety. The rescue is complete when a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat airlifts the survivors back to their base. While Jim thinks that Susan has fallen in love with Allen, she reunites with him as they both bid Allen goodbye.

He was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and optioned his first screenplay, the story of Elvis Presley returning from the grave to become President, shortly after graduating NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. In 2004 he formed Stag Films, writing and co-producing the independent feature film, Pervert! starring Mary Carey, an homage to Russ Meyer, 1970s sexploitation and grindhouse horror films. Davis has worked with writer/director Matt Piedmont, contributing to comedy segments created by Piedmont for Bud TV, Funny or Die and Comedy Central. Davis's directorial debut Sex Galaxy was created entirely out of recycled stock and public domain footage, primarily from the 1968 film Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, which in turned borrowed heavily from Planeta Bur. It screened on the international film festival circuit, winning two \\"Best Feature\\" awards and one for \\"Best Drinking Movie,\\" and was released by Breaking Glass Pictures and Unearthed Films in 2008. Due to its \\"recycling\\" of copyright-free stock footage, Davis has dubbed it the world's first 'green movie'. Davis followed with another 'green' film, the horror/comedy/political satire President Wolfman, about the U.S. President being bitten by a werewolf and terrorizing the streets of Washington. President Wolfman culled much of its footage from The Werewolf of Washington starring Dean Stockwell, in addition to over one hundred other film sources. The movie won many festival awards, including Best Feature, Audience Choice and Best Script, and is distributed by Wild Eye Releasing on VHS and DVD, released in 2014.

The Qidwai, together with the Milki, Malik and Chaudhary form a community of substantial landowners.People of India Uttar Pradesh (Manohar Publications), Volume XLII Part One, edited by A Hasan & J C Das pp. 968-972. History and origin The Qidwai or Kidwai are a community of Shaikhs in Pakistan and India. They are mostly settled in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. They are also settled in the city of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. The Qidwa claim descent from Qazi Qidwa, a son of the Sultans of Rum, in what is now modern Turkey. There are differing traditions as to the ethnic origin of the Qazi. Some sources claim he was a descendant of original Jews of Medina. While other sources claim that he was a Bani Israil descendant by lineage. This reaffirms their monotheistic beliefs unlike other Muslim converts who were formally polytheists. Qazi Qidwa fell out the Sultan, his brother, and migrated to India, with wife and son. There he became a close associate of the famous Sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti. The saint is said to have sent him to the Awadh region to spread Islam, where he is said to have won over fifty villages to Islam. The Qidwai were native Muslims of Uttar Pradesh. Sufi saints are claimed to have gone to the Awadh region to spread Islam, where he is said to have won over fifty villages to Islam. These fifty villages were later awarded to him, and the region became known as Qidwara. According to another tradition, Qazi Qidwa is said have defeated a local ruler in the Awadh region by the name of Raja Jagdeopur. This Raja was said to have belonged to the aboriginal Bhar community. The original settlement of the tribe was Juggaur in Lucknow district, from where they spread to Barabanki District. The taluqdar families have historically intermarried with the Awadhi Bhatti, a neighbouring Muslim Rajput community, with whom they share many cultural traits.Barabanki: A Gazetteer (Government of India Press, 1904), Volume XLVIII, by H. R Neville, p. 100. Present circumstances The abolishment of the zamindar system by the newly independent India in 1947 had a major impact on the Qidwai community. The larger estates were broken, and land given to the farmers who worked on their lands. This led to some emigration of the Qidwais to Pakistan.Caste and Social Stratification among Muslims (Manohar, 1978), edited by Imtiaz Ahmed, pp. 209-215.

The band is composed of volunteers from all walks of life and can range in size from ten to over one hundred performers at any given performance. Most of their music comes from songs arranged for marching bands, including Swing, Latin, Marches and some notable original pieces. Performing at home and on the road in festivals, on stages and in unexpected places, they play in support of community events and fundraisers of all kinds. History The band was formed in 1974 as an outgrowth of a community theater. Kelly's Seed & Feed Theater was formed in 1973 by founder Kelly Morris. Kelly wanted a band associated with his theater, one that would later appear in stage shows. The theater closed its doors in 1979, but the band that was formed originally by many of its actors has lived on. The band's first public performance was after a production of Sam Shepard's play La Turista on a spring night in 1974. There were no uniforms, no majorettes, and the band was led by a highstepping conductor keeping time with a broom. At this early event only two tunes were playable by the band: The Washington Post march and March Grandioso. Members As noted above, members of the band come from a variety of backgrounds. The members are generally divided into following groups: * Abominables play instruments, whether they are horns, drums, or accordions * Abominettes wear majorette costumes and march in front of the band * Despicables act somewhat like rodeo clowns, surrounding the band and providing crowd control or warning the other members of road hazards on the route * Incorrigibles are children of band members Alumni of the band who leave the Atlanta area have been known to form their own versions of the band in other cities. One example of this is the Hill Stompers, formed by two previous members who married and moved to Los Alamos. Performances The band can be found playing in a wide range of locations throughout Atlanta. While some of the performances are sponsored, most are at community-oriented events such as the Little Five Points Halloween Festival, the Inman Park Festival and Tour of Homes and the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina. However, the Seed & Feed is best known for its trademark \\"blitz\\" performances. During a blitz, band members will show up unannounced and unexpected at neighborhood bars, coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, book signings and subway stations playing to all who will listen. As a result, the mission of the band is sometimes stated as \\"bringing the gift of music to those who didn't know they needed it.\\" The band has some stock routines that they use during performances, including a version of Stars and Stripes Forever with a \\"wander and die\\" feature. During the trio, the members \\"wander\\" aimlessly and slow the tempo of the song until all the members lie \\"dead\\" on the ground. The band is then resurrected by a member playing When the Saints Go Marching In. Some other notable performances: *2013: Performing in the annual HONK! Fest West music festival and Solstice Parade in Seattle *2008 - 2012: Performing in the annual HONK! Music Festival in Somerville, MA. *2005: Leading the annual Sweet Potato Queens Parade in Jackson, MS. *1994-1995: Performances with the Indigo Girls and a collection of other Atlanta-based bands in productions of Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection.

It was printed semiweekly beginning in 1876 and ceased publication on February 27, 1877. During Reconstruction the editor, Josiah Turner, conducted a fervid campaign against carpetbaggers. The newspaper was the voice of the Democratic Party (United States), whose supporters were referred to as Conservatives. History of publication In June 1866 Turner said that he received a letter from Robert E. Lee. The general reported having misplaced his papers, which delayed him in writing a book about the American Civil War. Theodore Bryant Kingsbury (1828 - 1913) left the Methodist Church ministry to edit the Raleigh Sentinel. He was a former journalist in Oxford, North Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1876 he moved to Wilmington to edit the Wilmington Morning Star. On October 11, 1872, the offices of the Raleigh Sentinel were bombed with gunpowder. The powder was placed beneath a Hoe's large cylinder press early in the campaign to determine the outcome of the 1872 presidential election. Damage to property was estimated at $3,000. The Raleigh Sentinels views were in line with those of Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Herald. Like Greeley, the North Carolina newspaper exposed the corruption of the administration of Ulysses Grant. On March 16, 1876, Turner and W.H.H. Howerton, North Carolina Secretary of State, were arrested and charged with conspiracy and libel.

Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century, pp. 34-35. 1398 mission to Japan King Taejo dispatched a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1398‚Äì1399. This embassy to shogunal court of Ashikaga Yoshimochi was led by Pak. In part, the envoy was charged with conveying a response to a message sent to the Joseon court by the Japanese sh≈çgun. In part, the Joseon ambassador sought Ashikaga involvement in suppressing pirate raiders which were believed to come from Japan. These pirates were variously known as wokou (Chinese character: ÂÄ≠ÂØá; Chinese pronunciation: w≈çk√≤u; Japanese pronunciation: wak≈ç; Korean pronunciation: ÏôúÍµ¨ waegu).Kang, p. 275. Pak and his retinue arrived in Kyoto in the early autumn of 1398 (≈åei 5, 8th month). Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi presented the envoy with a formal diplomatic letter; and presents were given for the envoy to convey to the Joseon court.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annalese des empereurs du japon, p. 322. When Pak returned from Japan in 1399, he brought with him more than 100 wak≈ç captives, an explicit earnest of good fatih. Pak also bore letters from the Ashikaga sh≈çgun requesting original texts of Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist altar fittings. Pak conveyed the following letter from Sh≈çgun Yoshimitsu to the governor of Kyushu: :\\"This instruction is hereby given to you, ≈åuchi Sakyo-no-Tayu (≈åuchi Yoshihiro). The Korean envoy, in compliance with the command of his government, came to our country, crossing waters of vast expanse. He brought us a gift of great value from his nation, thus showing us great courtesy. We have highly appreciated this. Now that this envoy is returning to his country, we should send products of our land in recognition of this gift and as a token of our good will. :\\"You are also instructed to inform the Korean envoy that all the pirates and persons of the unruly class in Kyushu have been arrested and punished in accordance with the provisions of our laws, and that we are sending troops under the convoy of our fleet to various far-off islands with the purpose of annihilating all the remaining pirate bands. Therefore, from this time on, all ships coming from and returning to Korea will be safeguarded. Thus will the friendship of the two nations be maintained. :\\"For several years past, we have made many earnest attempts to publish the Daiz≈çky≈ç, a standard Buddhistic sutra, but have not yet succeeded. According to our understanding, Korea has an excellent edition of this sutra. We would therefore ask that Korea meet our long-felt need by sending us a complete set of this edition. If Korea should grant this request, the propagation of Buddhism toward the East would be materially advanced. We also desire to have a large Buddhistic church bell made of copper, and we also wish to secure good medicinal herbs from Korea. The Buddhistic sutras and accessories are needed in our country in order to save our people from suffering in a future existence. The medicinal herbs will enable our people to enjoy health and longevity in this present world. Korea possesses them in great abundance. :\\"You are imperatively instructed to convey these desires to the Korean envoy and to impress him with our great need of and desire for them, in order that we may not fail to obtain them.\\"Kuno, Yoshi S.

Pak's words and actions were more narrowly focused in negotiating protocols for Joseon‚ÄìJapan diplomatic relations. Recognition in the West Pak's historical significance was confirmed when his mission was specifically mentioned in a widely distributed history published by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1834.

He is mainly known for his portraits and genre pieces of elegant couples in interiors and, to a lesser extent, for his religious and mythological compositions. He was a gifted mezzotint artist.Jan Verkolje (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Trained in Amsterdam Verkolje spent his active professional career in Delft where he had access to powerful patrons.Walter Liedtke, Michiel C. Plomp and Axel Ruger, Vermeer and The Delft School, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2001, p. 29 Life The messenger Verkolje was the son of Benjamin Jacobsz, a locksmith, and Maria Tonnes. He was baptized in the Nieuwezijds Kapel in Amsterdam on 9 February 1659.Johannes Verkolje at Essential Vermeer The early artist biographer Arnold Houbraken recounts that Verkolje was a child prodigy, who became a self-taught artist after hurting himself while playing with darts as a child. As the injury on his heel or ankle did not heal well he was bedridden for years. To while away the time, he started to copy prints. The artist Jan Gerritsz van Bronckhorst gave him high-quality prints to copy. Thus started his artistic career according to Houbraken. Subsequently Jan studied for about half a year with Jan Andrea Lievens (1644‚Äì1680), the son of the prominent painter Jan Lievens.Johannes Verkolje biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718, pp. 282‚Äì286 Portrait of a lady and child holding a spaniel In 1672, the so-called rampjaar (disaster year), which was marked by a large-scale invasion of the Dutch Republic by French and other armies, Verkolje moved from Amsterdam to Delft. Here he married Judith Voorheul in October 1672. He became a member of the Guild of St. Luke of Delft in 1673 and served as its dean between 1678 and 1688. Verkolje was very successful and enjoyed the patronage of important patrons in Delft as well as the court in the Hague.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 29 As a portrait painter his only competitor in Delft was Cornelis de Man.Bakker, Piet. \\"Cornelis de Man\\", in: The Leiden Collection Catalogue. Edited by Arthur K. Wheelock Jr. New York. (accessed 5 May 2018 His sons Nikolaas Verkolje (Delft, 1673 ‚Äì Amsterdam, 1746) and Jan II (Delft, 1683 ‚Äì Amsterdam, 1755) were trained by Verkolje as painters. Nikolaas had a successful career. Verkolje's other pupils included Albertus van der Burch, Joan van der Spriet, Willem Verschuring, and Thomas van der Wilt. In addition to these pupils, Houbraken also mentions Henrik Steenwinkel. Verkolje died in Delft in 1693 aged 43 when he was at the peak of his fame. He was buried in the Oude Kerk (Delft). He left a wife, three sons and two daughters. Work General Portrait of two sisters and their brother playing with a dog Verkolje was a versatile artist who worked as a painter, draughtsman and engraver. His subject matter was mainly portraits and genre scenes. He was also a gifted mezzotint artist, who according Houbraken, discovered the technique on his own. Portrait painting Verkolje was a prolific portrait artist who created portrait paintings, drawings, and prints.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 180 In his portrait work Verkolje was representative of the style then current in The Hague and Amsterdam rather than that in vogue in Delft.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 53 Verkolje was much in demand as a portraitist and was able to fetch high prices for his portraits. His sitters were a who's who of Delft society of his time: the famous scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (whom he portrayed on canvas and in mezzotint), the prominent lawyer and bailiff Johan de la Faille and his wife (both works are in the Wadsworth Atheneum), the vicar Cornelius van Aken, the painter Pieter Jansz van Asch, and the burgomaster and historian Dirk van Bleiswijk.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 180 Verkolje also created portrait prints of international celebrities such as Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin, King James II of England, Willem III, Prince of Orange, and his wife, Mary Stuart. Of these celebrity subjects, only the Delft naturalist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was portrayed by Verkolje in a painting (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) as well as in a print. His other portraits of famous persons were mezzotint engravings after the work of other artists, such as Peter Lely, Willem Wissing and Godfrey Kneller. Most of Verkolje's known portrait drawings were made as preparation for his paintings. These drawings focused either on particular facial features and expressions or on the whole composition.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 180 Elegant couple with musical instruments in an interior Genre art At the time Verkolje was active in Delft, Gerard ter Borch was the leading genre painter working in the city. Ter Borch was known for his meticulous working method which resulted in a very low output. Like other genre painters such as Gabriel Metsu and Frans van Mieris, Verkolje took advantage of the limited supply of Ter Borch genre paintings in the market by creating works that imitated the style of, or took their inspiration from, ter Borch.Ekkehard Mai, Holland nach Rembrandt: zur niederl√§ndischen Kunst zwischen 1670 und 1750, Volume 10, Front B√∂hlau Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2006, p. 250 Verkolje's genre paintings typically depict elegant figures in interiors engaged in music making or the playing of games. Often the protagonists are couples engaged in courtship. A dog is always present. In The messenger (1674, the Mauritshuis) Verkolje reprises the theme of the delivery of a letter, which had been treated previously by other Delft artists such as Vermeer. The Messenger shows a young couple playing backgammon in an elegant room. They have been interrupted by a regimental messenger who has entered the room to deliver a letter likely calling the young man to duty. The young couple are clearly startled by the arrival of the messenger just as is the dog in the room. The openly emotional reaction of the participants in the scene contrasts with that of the persons in Vermeer's works when receiving letters. Vermeer's figures react in a more contemplative rather than an emotional manner. Verkolje also tended to add a greater naturalness to this figures than Vermeer.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 167 Temptation The portraits of Verkolje often doubled as genre pieces in their extensive detail and the addition of emblematic and symbolic elements. This is clear in the double Distinguished Gentleman and Lady in an Interior (at Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder). The crossed trunks of the trees visible outside on the left and their intertwined crowns possible symbolise the commitment to each other of the sitters while the fountain is likely an allegory of the source of life or a reference to fertility.Jan Verkolje, Distinguished Gentleman and Lady in an Interior at Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder Prints Jan Verkolje started engraving in 1670. The mezzotint work of Jan Verkolje shows the influence of the smoother tone developed by Abraham Blooteling. Various of his prints were made after portraits by Lely and Wissing and were printed in England even though Verkolje likely never visited England.Arthur M. Hind, A History of Engraving and Etching, Courier Corporation, 2011, p. 266 In addition to his portrait prints, Verkolje also produced prints of mythological scenes and genre scenes, some after Jacob Ochtervelt and Hendrick Terbrugghen.Jan Verkolje at the Rijksmuseum A well- known mezzotint work of Verkolje is the Venus and Adonis. It was made after a painting by Verkolje the whereabouts of which is now unknown. In the work Verkolje demonstrates his mastery of the mezzotint technique for which he was much admired in his time. He was able to render the textures of the fabrics in a very realistic manner and to visualise the softness of the clouds.Vermeer and The Delft School, p. 178  References  External links * Category:1650 births Category:1693 deaths Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch portrait painters Category:Dutch genre painters Category:Artists from Amsterdam Category:Artists from Delft Category:Members of the Delft Guild of Saint Luke Category:Dutch Golden Age printmakers ","title":"Jan Verkolje"},{"id":"24202400","text":"Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!

Early life Edward Folmer Archdale was born on 8 September 1921 to Royal Navy officer and later Vice Admiral Sir Nicholas Archdale, 2nd Baronet, Aide-de-Camp to King George V of the United Kingdom. His mother was from Denmark. Nicknamed \\"Teddy\\", he joined the Royal Navy after attending Copthorne Primary School in Sussex. He was in the Rodney class of 1935 at Dartmouth Naval College. After graduation, he was promoted to midshipman and served into the start of the war. War service He served aboard and . By May 1940, he was serving aboard under Lieutenant Commander Brian Dean. Operation Dynamo HMS Sabre was conspicuous in the evacuation of British and French soldiers from the beaches of beaches at Malo-Les-Bains and the harbour mole during the Dunkirk evacuation. During nine days and nights of the evacuation, despite being damaged in an air attack, Sabre made ten round trips to Dunkirk. An example of her activity at this time: In the early hours of 28 May, three ships boats from HMS Sabre picked up 100 men in two hours, from the beaches at Malo-Les- Bains to the east of the harbour mole. Then it was full speed to Dover with a turnaround of only 58 minutes, and the ship was back again at the Dunkirk harbour mole at 11.00am, where they loaded a further 800 men. Departing at 12.30pm, by now the ships weight had increased considerably, lowering her propeller draft. This meant because of the falling tide and a defective echo sounder, Lieutenant-Commander Dean had to slowly edge her passage through the shallows. She arrived back in Dover at 6.20pm. Refuelled, she was back to the Dunkirk mole at 10.30pm, the third trip of the day. This time, the ship stayed for only 35 minutes picking up another 500 troops.Lord, p116 Finally on Tuesday the 4 June just after two in the afternoon the Admiralty announced the end of Operation Dynamo. All together an armada of over 860 ships including 39 destroyers had taken part in the evacuation of troops from the beaches and harbour. The Admiralty calculated the total British and Allied troops landed in England amounted to 338,226 troops rescued. HMS Sabre had made more round trips than most and brought back to Dover a total of 5,765 soldiers ‚Äì amongst the highest number for any individual ship. Lieutenant Commander Dean was awarded a Distinguished Service Order on 6 June. Archdale, Sabre's midshipman, was mentioned in despatches. Operation Ariel After Dunkirk there were still Allied forces to be evacuated from other French ports along the coast westward so the navy had further work to do. ‚ÄòOperation Cycle' launched on 10 June rescued some 11,000 from the Channel port of Le Havre. Then on the 12th HMS Sabre was deployed to help with the evacuation of still more British and Allied forces in ‚ÄòOperation Ariel‚Äô from the rest of France. It began with the evacuation of Cherbourg and continued for the next ten days, moving south to St Nazaire, Bordeaux, and right down to the Franco-Spanish border. Sabre was sent to Alderney the northerly island amongst the Channel Islands on 23 June and helped evacuate around 1,400 islanders to safety in Weymouth. Rescuing children from SS Volendam In September 1940 Archdale was with HMS Sabre, detailed to meet the first slow Atlantic convoy, as it approached the United Kingdom from Canada. A Finnish merchant ship, Elle 3,868 tons was torpedoed at 04.25hrs on the 28th and Sabre joined the hunt for the German U-boat (U-101) without success. Then two days later, during the evening of the 30 August off Malin Head Sabre helped rescue the survivors of a torpedoed (by German submarine U-60) Dutch ship the 15,000 tons Holland America line, SS Volendam. She was in an outward bound convoy OB-205 for Canada, carrying 600 passengers, including 321 children under the Children's Overseas Reception Board scheme some as young as five, together with a crew of 250. They were taken to various west coast ports in Scotland.Gourock Times 6 Sept 1940 In January 1941 Dean was badly injured in heavy seas and Sabre put into Larne, Northern Ireland. Lieutenant Peter Gretton took command from 11 January 1941. Archdale completed his training in and , later famous for her capture of the Enigma machine, before volunteering to serve in submarines.

A goalkeeper, he won two caps for the Welsh national team. He was killed in action during the First World War. Career Born in Presteigne, the son of a coal merchant, Griffiths played junior football in Wales before beginning his senior career with the Blackpool-based club South Shore in 1895. He went on to play for other Lancashire-based clubs Clitheroe, Blackpool and Stalybridge Rovers. On 3 February 1900, while on the books of Blackpool, he made his debut for Wales in an international match against Scotland at Aberdeen and later in the year played against England, making him the first Blackpool player to win an international cap. He also played in the Seasiders first ever match at Bloomfield Road. He later moved south to join Millwall Athletic before moving across London to join Tottenham Hotspur, then playing in the Southern Football League. In 1901 Griffiths returned to Lancashire to join Preston North End of The Football League. He made ten league appearances for the club before once more returning to London to play for West Ham United in 1902. He replaced William Biggar in goal after Biggar conceded five goals in a defeat to Wellingborough Town, and remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper for two seasons. In the summer of 1904 he joined New Brompton, where he spent two seasons, making over 50 first team appearances and serving as club captain. He next joined Middlesbrough but never played for the club's first team, before a final move to minor club Moore's Athletic of Shirebrook, where he also worked as a coalminer. Post-playing career After retiring from playing, Griffiths worked as a coal miner in the Midlands and trained local teams in Shirebrook before joining the British Army during World War I. He served with the 15th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (Notts and Derby Regiment), reaching the rank of serjeant. The unit had originally been raised as a bantam battalion in Nottingham in 1915. By 1917 the battalion was part of 35th Division which was thrown into the Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917. Griffiths was killed in action on 30 October 1917, along with four others of his battalion (another 15 were wounded that day).

Other popular songs were \\"Skj√¶rsliperen\\" (1956) and \\"Norge i r√∏dt, hvitt og bl√•tt\\" (1963). He made about 150 recordings for the record company NERA from 1946 to 1958, and about forty recordings for the record company HMV between 1958 and 1965. During his career he made more than ninety national tours, and also toured European countries with his revue ensemble. In the 1970s he contributed to a series of radio programs, by singing and telling stories from his career. Already in the mid-1950s he became the first Norwegian artist to sell over one million records. He later came to be the top record selling musician in Norway in the 20th century, with a conservative estimate of more than two million sold items. According to other estimates, the number was over three and a half million. Book-Jenssen was awarded the Spellemannprisen honorary award in 1972, and was also decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and HM The King's Medal of Merit. His last television appearance was in connection with his 85-year anniversary, when he was celebrated in a show on the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation by a wide array of Norwegian artists. He died on 28 March 1999, and was buried from a capacity church in Haslum, B√¶rum.

Almond had a major role in forming Stoke Ramblers believed to have been in 1863 when Railway students from the Charterhouse School moved to Stoke-upon- Trent to work as apprentices for the North Staffordshire Railway. Amongst them was Henry Almond who was a keen sportsman and it is believed that he introduced organised club football to the local workers, although there is no record that matches took place. However, in 1868 it was reported in The Field newspaper that Stoke Ramblers had been formed with Almond as its captain and the club was to play under association football rules. It remains unclear as to whether Stoke played any matches from 1863 to 1868. He played in and scored the first ever Stoke goal against E.W May's XV in a friendly on 17 October 1868. He left Staffordshire soon after to continue his career in railway. Later he became a successful Civil Engineer, going abroad to work in Costa Rica for the Venezuela-based La Guayra and Caracus Railway Company. He died at sea the age of 60.

It had an important role in the political history of Timor during the 17th and 18th century, being a client state of the Portuguese colonialists, and later subjected to the Netherlands East Indies.  History  Amarasi priests, father & son. The origins of Amarasi are recounted in various legends. The oldest available version says that the dynastic line originated from Wehali, the traditional political navel of Timor in Belu. A member of a local family, Nafi Rasi, accidentally broke a valuable bowl and was forced too flee the wrath of his siblings. With his followers he went to Beboki-Insana to the north of Wehali, and thence to the south coast of West Timor.Geerloff Heijmering, 'Bijdragen tot de geschiedenis van Timor', Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Ind√´ 9:3 1847. There he founded a princedom with help of firearms that he had acquired in Beboki-Insana, which in turn lay close to the land of the Topasses (Portuguese mestizo population). Roaming groups from Belu arrived and strengthened the manpower of Nafi Rasi. In spite of its supposed Belunese origins, the population belonged to the Atoni group, speaking a dialect of Dawan. European sources confirm that Amarasi was a powerful domain in western Timor by the early 17th century. It was influenced by Catholicism through Dominican missionaries in the 1630s, and turned an important client of the Portuguese Topasses. In consequence, Amarasi fought the Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC), which attempted to expand its power on Timor, attracted by the stands of commercially valuable sandalwood. A sizeable Dutch expedition led by Arnold de Vlaming van Oudshoorn (1656) was soundly defeated by Amarasi and the Topasses.Arend de Roever, De jacht op sandelhout. Zutphen: Walburg Pers 2002, pp. 260-3. For almost a century after this event, Amarasi remained a Portuguese vassal, during much of the time fighting the Timorese clients of the VOC in the Kupang area in westernmost Timor. This was a low-scale warfare that took the form of headhunting raids.Hans H√§gerdal, 'White and Dark Stranger Kings; Kupang in the Early Colonial Era', Moussons 12 2009, p. 153. Amarasi was in fact counted as one of the principal props of Portuguese authority on Timor in this era.Artur Teodoro de Matos, Timor Portugu√™s, 1515-1769. Lisboa: Instituto Hist√≥rico Infante Dom Henrique 1974, pp.50-1.  Dutch rule  Raja of Amarasi. In 1749 the Amarasi soldiers were pushed to participate in a large-scale military campaign led by the Topasses against the Dutch in Kupang. In the resulting Battle of Penfui the Topasses were routed by the VOC forces, while Amarasi fled the field and subsequently submitted to the VOC. After a short time, in 1752, Amarasi attempted to withdraw from the new Dutch suzerainty, and rejoin the Portuguese camp. However, the princedom was badly defeated by the other Dutch clients, its king committed suicide and a large part of the manpower was killed or enslaved. The remaining Amarasi congregation was allowed after some years to settle in its old lands. From this point, the weakened princedom remained attached to Dutch interests until the 1940s.H.G. Schulte Nordholt, The Political System of the Atoni of Timor. The Hague: M. Nijhoff, pp. 181-2. By the 1820s, Amarasi consisted of three parts: Buwarein under the main ruler (Nai Jufa Naek), Talba, and Houmen, the latter two under district lords (Nai Jufa). Later in the 19th century a further division resulted in five parts. The district lords were in practice the near-equals of the central ruler or raja, and were in turn dependent on the various Amaf (local headmen). In 1930 the population of Amarasi was 16,832 people, and its area was an estimated 740 square kilometers.H.G. Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp. 155, 319-20.  Japanese occupation  During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942‚Äì1945) the raja of Amarasi, H.A. Koroh, was accused of collaborating with the Japanese, who recruited comfort women and conscript labourers (romusha) from the local population. After the Japanese capitulation in 1945, the raja kept a defiant attitude against the returning Dutch authorities.S. Farram, From 'Timor Koepang' to 'Timor NTT': The Political History of West Timor, 1901-1967, PhD Thesis, Northern Territory University 2003, pp. 227, 240-1.  Indonesia  In the first years after the achievement of Indonesian independence in 1949, the Amarasi princedom survived as a self-ruling territory or swapraja, until 1962, when the unitary Indonesian republic abolished traditional forms of governance in this region. Today Amarasi is included in the kabupaten (regency) Kupang, and constitutes the kecamatan (districts) Amarasi, Amarasi Barat, Amarasi Selatan, and Amarasi Timur. The centre of the region is the village Baun, where the last residence of the former rajas can still be seen.

Imitation During the late 1960s and early 1970s Richard Hugh Williams of Llandudno issued paper money which bore a 2d (2 \\"old\\" pence) Duty Stamp, which R H Williams paid for.

The first issues were made by \\"y Prif Trysorfa Cymru Cyfyngedig\\" (\\"the Chief Treasury of Wales Ltd‚Äù), and the significance of this company name appears to have been overlooked initially by the Stamp Office, as the notes were written in Welsh. It is unlikely that the notes would have been officially stamped - or even that registration of such a company name would have been allowed - if this had been recognised. When officials demanded that the company name be changed, Williams changed it to \\"Cwmni y Ddafad Ddu Gymreig Cyfyngedig\\" (the ‚ÄúBlack Sheep Company Ltd‚Äù), a name inspired by the bank note issues of the Aberystwith & Tregaron Bank.

Several new congregations have, however, been formed recently in the Belfast area, along with new fellowships in Galway and Dublin. History The church's roots date back to the 17th-century Plantation of Ulster by Scots Presbyterian settlers. When the Revolution Settlement was entered into in 1690 following the victory of William III in the Williamite War, a minority of Presbyterians refused to subscribe, claiming its failure to specifically recognise the kingship of Jesus Christ was a departure from the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. These dissenters, or Covenanters, began to hold separate meetings from the mainstream Presbyterians. The Ulster branch of the denomination was dependent on visits from Scottish ministers until 1757. A separate Irish presbytery was organised in April 1763, and its synod was constituted at Cullybackey on 1 May 1811.Glasgow, William M. A History of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in America.

Plans for the network involved a distribution reach through a combination of low-power and full-power broadcast television stations, most of which were to be built, and carriage on cable television providers. Religious denominations had long been recipients of free air time from broadcast stations. This was often because stations had a need to fulfill \\"public interest\\" obligations in order to maintain their licenses. It was estimated that by the mid-1970s, the Southern Baptist Convention received approximately $10 million in donations annually in the form of 2,500 free weekly broadcasts. The programming that religious networks produced included (in addition to services and teaching) family-oriented entertainment programs and occasionally cartoons, such as JOT. ACTS would expand on these, originally intending on drawing its programming almost exclusively from in-house sources. ACTS was the first television network established by a Protestant denomination. ACTS launched in 1984 as a non-commercial service, but was converted into a for-profit network in 1988. In 1992, ACTS began sharing channel space with a similarly formatted cable network, the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, with the two being co- branded under the name VISN-ACTS. The unified channel later evolved into the Faith & Values Channel and Odyssey, before eventually relaunching (with minimal religious content) as the Hallmark Channel in 2001 following its purchase by Crown Media Holdings. ACTS ceased operations in 2003. History ACTS was initially organized in December 1980, and was formed as a subsidiary of the Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission (RTVC) and the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board. ACTS was to be a nonprofit venture, and also disallowed any form of on-air solicitation. The network was the brainchild of former SBC president Jimmy R. Allen. Allen had been elected to the post of president of the RTVC immediately following the end of his tenure as convention president. One of his primary goals in the post was to help local churches use radio and television effectively and to \\"explore the ways and means of accelerating a more direct primetime witness through television.\\" The plan for establishing the network revolved around building 100 or more low power (LPTV) and a small number of full-power stations throughout the United States. Each low-power station was to cost up to $150,000 to build and have a broadcast range of 10 to 15 miles from each station's transmitter site. In addition, it was planned that the network would eventually be carried by 1,000 cable systems. ACTS was projected to have a potential audience reach of 7 million households by the fall of 1984, and anywhere between 14 and 40 million at the end of 1985. However, some of the SBCs LPTV plans were held back when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) changed some of the regulations regarding the licensing of such stations. At the time of its launch, the network would consist of 23 broadcast television stations and distribution on 200 cable systems. The Spacenet One satellite was selected for distribution of the signal; it launched in the spring of 1984. The American Christian Television System launched on May 15, 1984, and was dedicated in June at the Southern Baptist Convention. By that time, the network had been granted 75 LPTV station licenses. At launch, ACTS consisted of two channels, ACTS and the Baptist Telecommunications Network (BTN). BTN was oriented toward churches, while the programming of ACTS was aimed at the general public. The programming mix of ACTS was planned to consist of about 75% family-oriented entertainment programs and 25% direct teaching and preaching. Daily programming was to be recycled in loops, up to 16 hours each day of its program content would consist of reruns. The 1980s saw a rapid expansion in the number of cable channels vying for limited space on cable systems; this included a number of religious channels. Channels of this type which had already been established at the time that ACTS was formed included the National Christian Network, the PTL Satellite Network, the Christian Broadcasting Network, and the Trinity Broadcasting Network. By 1984, even more networks had been formed, including the Eternal Word Television Network and National Jewish Television; each of these competed for limited headend space on cable providers, a situation made more complicated by the fact that some companies would only carry one religious network. By 1986, the network had achieved a potential viewer reach of 2.6 million television households. It had also acquired $8.5 million in debt, leading to a restructuring of the organization. Internal SBC documentation admitted that the planning had been overly optimistic, and the operational and programming expenses were beyond what could be sustained. The SBC sold ACTS in 1988 to a newly formed company called Friends of ACTS, Inc., based in San Antonio, Texas. While the SBC retained ultimate control over the channel, the new arrangement offered several advantages. Friends of ACTS, Inc. had been formed by a group of evangelical multidenominational investors as a for-profit entity, which the network had also now become. It was hoped that the multidenominational composition would attract large cable companies, some of which had shied away from carrying the network citing concerns about the SBC's singular control over content. To some extent, this meant that conservative faith traditions such as Lutherans, Presbyterians and Methodists, as well as Catholics and Jews were represented in the network's programming. Under the terms of the agreement, the SBC would continue to provide the majority of the programming and receive a small portion of revenues from the network. The sale was valued at about $170 million. At that time, the network was reported to have an audience reach of six million viewers. The new management immediately switched satellites to Galaxy III, a move intended to increase ACTS' viewing potential. By 1990, the network was estimated to have a reach of 9.2 million viewers, and distribution on 475 affiliate stations and cable systems. That year, Jack B. Johnson was elected president of the RTVC, replacing Jimmy R. Allen. ACTS acquired FamilyNet from Jerry Falwell in 1991. The network was programmed separately from ACTS,Religious Broadcasting (November 1992). David Clark, President, National Religious Broadcasters. and was carried exclusively on broadcast stations. FamilyNet was sold off to In Touch Ministries (operated by Dr. Charles Stanley) in 2007, representing the end of the SBC's direct ventures in television. In July 1992, ACTS entered into a merger agreement with the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network (VISN). Each network was to provide part of the programming, but maintain separate branding identities during their allocated timeslots. The Southern Baptist Church would provide eight hours of programming daily for the network, which would produce substantial savings. At the time of the merger, ACTS had a viewer reach of 8.2 million television homes and VISN 12.8 million; the combined network would reach about 20 million and allow a potential audience of 57.5 million households with at least one television set. The merger opened up large markets that ACTS had been unable to get a foothold into including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Salt Lake City.Religious Broadcasting (November 1992). Steve Gregory, Director of Public Relations, Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission. The new deal would add over 1,000 cities to ACTS' audience, and the number of cable providers carrying the channel increased from 655 to 1,374. The new network would continue to ban activities such as proselytizing, on-air fundraising, and maligning other faiths. Even so, some Baptists expressed concerns about the merger. Some were disturbed by the composition and programming of VISN. Whereas ACTS had specific content guidelines based on the views of the SBC, VISN did not rely on any form of creed or universal statement of faith. VISN was represented by member organizations of 54 faiths including non-Christians, ranging from Muslim groups to Buddhists, to others that some conservative Baptists considered cultish.Religious Broadcasting (November 1992). Rod Payne, Minister of Media, First Baptist Church, Wichita Falls, Texas. One former producer for ACTS expressed that \\"ACTS will be working with those many would consider to be false prophets, assisting to build a large audience for their message... I feel that they have taken a step backwards in their effort to accomplish their mission.\\"Religious Broadcasting (November 1992). Ron Harris, Minister of Media, First Baptist Church, Dallas. This was made even more problematic by the fact that local Baptist-owned resources including churches and schools were sometimes providing the downlink to local cable systems. Also, partially because the Baptist Press had been prohibited from reporting on the matter, those local affiliates were not informed about the deal until after it was signed. Still others expressed concern that the goal of VISN had been to replace and supplant ACTS.Religious Broadcasting (November 1992). Jerry Rose, President, WCFC-TV38 / Chicago. VISN-ACTS went through several relaunches in the 1990s including its 1992 revamp as the Faith and Values Channel and the 1996 format change into the Odyssey Network, with direct religious content erosion occurring along the way. In 2001, it became the Hallmark Channel, focusing mainly on entertainment programming aimed at a family audience. Support was withdrawn in 2003, and the ACTS network ceased operations.

In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines. Macedonia during the reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians. Chief among Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes, who may have coordinated a temporary alliance with Athens. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi and Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia proper, and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania). Philip II eventually campaigned against the city-state of Athens and her allies in the Aegean region, as well as Thebes after the decline of its hegemony in mainland Greece. In the defence of the Amphictyonic League of Delphi and in conjunction with the Thessalian League, Macedonia became a key player in the Third Sacred War (356‚Äì346 BC), defeating the Phocians, commanded by Onomarchus, at the Battle of Crocus Field in 352 BC. While poised to launch a direct assault on Athens in 346 BC, the Macedonian king was met with an Athenian embassy that arranged a peace treaty known as the Peace of Philocrates. As a result, Macedonia and Athens became allies, yet Athens was forced to relinquish its claims to the city of Amphipolis (in modern-day Central Macedonia). The Peace of Philocrates eventually broke down as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered a series of speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, a task that instead fell to his son and successor, Alexander the Great. Sources Marble bust of the Athenian statesman Aeschines, 4th century BC, British Museum Intact and relatively detailed histories of Greece, such as Herodotus's The Histories, Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, and Xenophon's Hellenica cover the period from roughly 500‚Äì362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant period of Greek history (359‚Äì336 BC), although it is included within various universal histories.. The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source.. Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the period of Philip's reign, but the action is much compressed, and due to the scope of the work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same period elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.; . Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the period therefore contains many gaps.. Another surviving work for the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History. Justin's epitomised history is also much condensed from the no- longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the history of Macedon before him, the exploits of Philip's son, Alexander the Great, and his diadochi successors during the Hellenistic period.; . These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.; . Outside the brief notices of Philip's exploits which occur in Diodorus and Justin, further details of his campaigns (and indeed the period in general) can be found in the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily Demosthenes and Aeschines, which have survived intact. Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with great circumspection, particularly given the identity of the authors. Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as \\"a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to have told the truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie\\".. For instance, the Peace of Philocrates (made in 346 BC) is known primarily from their speeches (both called On the False Embassy), made in 343 BC, when Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines for his involvement in making the peace treaty.. In his speech, Aeschines poses as the champion of the peace treaty, when he had in fact opposed making peace; conversely, Demosthenes, who had been a proponent of peace in 346 BC represents himself as part of the \\"war-party\\". The arguments made in the speeches therefore refer to the political situation in 343 BC and not the situation when the treaty was made, which makes teasing out the actual historical threads rather difficult. Background Greece in the early 4th century BC The Theban hegemony; power-blocks in Greece in the decade up to 362 BC. In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395‚Äì387 BC.; . Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace.. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta.. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.Diodorus, XV.55.Plutarch. Pelopidas, 23; Xenophon. Hellenica, 6.4. Following up on this victory, Epaminondas invaded Peloponnesus in 370 BC and began dismantling the basis of Spartan dominance. Spartan power rested on the forced labour of the helots of Messenia, which allowed the entire male Spartan population to dedicate themselves to warfare.. This focused military training system had previously enabled Sparta to exert power out of proportion to its small population. However, after their losses at Leuctra, the Spartans were unable to resist Epaminondas's invasion, and he marched into Messenia and liberated the helots, thereby permanently crippling Sparta.. The Thebans then began to extend their influence over Greece, effectively replacing the Spartan hegemony with their own... The Theban generals Pelopidas and Epaminondas campaigned all over Greece for the next 9 years to further Theban power and influence. In 362 BC, Epaminondas's fourth invasion of the Peloponnesus, which reached its climax at the Battle of Mantinea, brought almost every state in Greece into the conflict, on one side or the other.Xenophon. Hellenica, 7.5. Although the Thebans and their allies were victorious at Mantinea, Epaminondas was killed, and Theban losses were heavy. Xenophon, summing up his account of Mantinea, suggests that: The years of conflict which resulted from the Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left much of the country war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between all the states of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea.; . With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system, and Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. It was the Athenians, and their second League, who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the regular state of war between Macedon and Athens.. Expansion of Macedon under Philip II of Macedon Philip's accession In 360 BC, the Macedonian army under Perdiccas III had been defeated in battle by the Dardanian tribe of Illyria; Perdiccas and 4,000 troops had been killed. The Illyrians prepared to invade Macedon; meanwhile, the Paionians were ravaging Macedonian territory, the Thracians were preparing to invade in support of the pretender Pausanias, as were the Athenians, in support of a different pretender, Argeus.Diodorus, XVI.2 . In short, Macedon was in another of its periodic crises.. The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was at this time still an infant. Philip, the sole surviving son of Amyntas III, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as king.. It is also possible that he was initially acclaimed as regent for his nephew Amyntas IV, and later usurped the throne, although if so, he did not harm Amyntas. Either way, Philip II became king by 359 BC, and began energetically attempting to save Macedon from destruction..  Macedonian recovery (359‚Äì358 BC) Reconstruction of the army Painted depiction of a soldier wearing the linothorax, from the Tomb of Judgement in Mieza in Imathia, Greece, 4th/3rd century BC Philip's first priorities were to reconstruct the Macedonian army, and restore the morale of both the army and the people. He held a series of assemblies with the Macedonian people, and \\"exhorting them with eloquent speeches to be men, he built up their morale\\".Diodorus, XVI.3 . He exhaustively re-trained his men with new tactics and equipment. In particular, he instigated the use of the phalanx formation by the Macedonian foot-soldiery, and equipped the troops with 6-metre long pikes (the sarissa), in contrast to the 2‚Äì3-metre spear (doru) used by Greek hoplites. Diplomacy At the same time, Philip engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery. Battle of Methone Macedon's neighbours in antiquity Philip realized that the sole intention of the Athenian support for Argeus was to recover Amphipolis (see below), which they hoped to do by placing Argeus on the throne. Philip therefore withdrew the Macedonian garrison from Amphipolis and declared it autonomous, to undermine the purpose of Athenian support for Argeus. The Athenian expedition, led by Mantias, still landed at Methone on the Macedonian coast, with 3,000 mercenary troops. Mantias now declined to leave Methone, so Argeus instead led the troops to the ancient Macedonian capital of Aegae, hoping that the populace would declare him king. However, the people of Aegae showed no interest in doing so, and Argeus therefore marched back to Methone. On the way, he was attacked and defeated in battle by Philip, many of the Athenian mercenaries being slain and the rest taken captive. According to Diodorus, this victory did much to restore the morale of the Macedonian army, and gave the soldiers encouragement for the battles to come. Having defeated the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors to Athens. He was prepared to abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians to make peace with him.Diodorus, XVI.4 . Paionia and Illyria The following year (358 BC), Philip heard that the Paionian king, Agis, had died. Taking advantage of their political disarray and transition of power, Philip marched his army into Paionia, where he defeated the Paionians. He then compelled the tribe to swear allegiance to Macedon. Philip was now able to turn to the Illyrians, who were still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). Elimea and Eordaea had probably been the only principalities loyal to the Macedonian kingdom during the Illyrian invasion. On the other hand, Lynkestis was ruled by a competing dynasty related the Macedonian throne (and probably to Philip's mother, Eurydice) and other Upper Macedonia districts had links to foreign powers. Pelangonia was a traditional Athenian ally in Upper Macedonia whilst Lynkestis, Orestis and Tymphaea had links with the Molossian kingdom and Epirus. All of them enjoyed under the Illyrian and Paionian threat an opportunity to defy the central power and many were now under Bardylis hegemony. Philip held an assembly of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Philip had also married Phila of Elimeia, ensuring an alliance with a principality of Upper Macedonia reputed by their cavalry. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace on the basis of the status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus. Diodorus preserves the only account of the battle, which Beloch suggested may have taken place near Monastir.Oldfather, note to Diodorus XVI.4. He says that: According to Diodorus, some 7,000 Illyrians died in the battle. The Illyrians withdrew from Macedon and sued for peace. After this campaign Philip had established his authority inland as far as Lake Ohrid. Not only were the Illyrians expelled, but also the king Menelaus of Pelagonia was exiled to Athens,Bosworth, A. B. (1971). Philip II and Upper Macedonia. The Classical Quarterly, 21(1), 93-105. leaving Philip as the sole overlord of the Upper Macedonia area. This allowed him to levy troops from a wider manpower pool during the rest of his reign. Some areas like Pelagonia were outright annexed whilst others like the loyal Elimea or the more distant valleys kept their autonomy as vassals. Philip reorganized the Macedonian administration into districts or ethne and established the companion system to keep the Macedonian nobility controlled. Under that scheme, the sons of the Macedonian nobility were included in the king's household rather that autonomous lords. Many of Philip's and Alexander's more famous generals in the years to come were from the Upper Macedonia nobility. Philip also gained the favour of the Epirotes, his southwestern neighbors, who had also been at war with the Illyrians.. The following year, Philip married the niece of the Molossian king of Epirus, Myrtale, which may have brought the frontier area between Macedon and Epirus, Orestis, under Philip's sphere of influence as part of her dowry. To the northwest, Illyrians tribes like the Taulantii or the Dardanians had been expelled but not subjugated. To the north, the Strymon or the Nestus were the limits of Macedonia proper and the extent of control over Paionia was weaker. Sources and coins shows the Paionian had their own kings but most likely under some vassal or tributary status. Thessaly Justin and Diodorus both say that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC.Justin, VII.6. In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief ascendancy in the Greek world, after being unified under Jason of Pherae, who was appointed Tagus (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, Jason was assassinated in 370 BC, and his son Alexander became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the Thessalian League therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a desultory conflict in which both Macedon (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes in the aftermath of Mantinea, on-off conflict within Thessaly continued.. Alexander was himself assassinated in 358 BC, by his wife's brothers Lycophron and Tisiphonus, who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the Aleuadae, the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of Larissa, were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.Diodorus, XVI.14 . Philip II of Macedon ‚Äì a Macedonian silver tetradrachm coin minted during his reign Although Diodorus says that Philip defeated the new tyrants, Buckler considers it more likely that Philip's appearance on the scene allowed the Aleuadae to negotiate a peace settlement with Pherae from a position of greater strength.. Philip seems to have come away from the expedition with new wives from both Larissa (Philinna) and Pherae (Nicesipolis, Jason's niece), which is suggestive of a negotiated settlement; certainly, as Buckler says, \\"Philip came away from Thessaly with a foot in both camps\\". Philip appears to have had a strong interest in Thessaly from the start of his reign, even despite his problems elsewhere. There are several probable reasons for this interest. Firstly, and most pressingly, Philip probably wanted to take control of the border region of Perrhaebia (traditionally part of Thessaly), in order to secure Macedon's southern border. Secondly, since Larissa controlled the main north‚Äìsouth routes between Macedon and Thessaly, friendly relations with the Aleuadae would help protect Macedon and give Philip access to the rest of Greece. Thirdly, Thessaly had plentiful resources that Philip could see the long-term potential of exploiting: Summary to 358 BC Through his frenetic activity since coming to the throne, Philip had successfully shored up the Macedonian situation, defeating or making peace with Macedon's erstwhile enemies, whilst securing most of Macedon's borders, and revitalising and retraining his army. Conquest in the North (357‚Äì353 BC) Amphipolis (357 BC) Philip's next aim was to secure Macedon's eastern flank, which bordered Thrace, and in particular the city of Amphipolis.. Amphipolis was a major strategic point, situated on the Strymon River, where it controlled the only crossing point on the lower reaches of the river, and therefore access to and from Thrace. Eastwards expansion of his kingdom therefore required that Philip control Amphipolis.. The Athenians had founded a colony there in the previous century,. only to lose control of it during the Peloponnesian War. The Athenians were very keen to recover Amphipolis, partly because of its history, although the Amphipolitans were not inclined to return to Athenian control.. However, the main reasons were because of the location of Amphipolis close to forests needed for shipbuilding, and because it controlled the gold and silver mines of Mount Pangaion.Oldfather, note to Diodorus XVI.3. The importance of Amphipolis to the Athenians during this period cannot be overstated; \\"their longing for it was constant and extreme\\". View of the Strymon River from the acropolis of Amphipolis Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, promptly appealed to Athens, offering to return to its control.. However, during the siege, Philip sent a letter to Athens saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to follow the same policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see whether he would. The Athenians may also have been unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north. Philip was to make repeated use of the Etesian winds, campaigning during those months (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies. The Athenians seem to have offered Philip Pydna in exchange for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, but it is not clear whether Philip agreed to this.. By this stage, the Social War of 357‚Äì355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city.Diodorus, XVI.8 . Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately. Pydna and Potidea (357‚Äì356 BC) During the siege of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's territorial ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him.. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in the territory of the Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league. Philip had no intention of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.. In 356 BC, Philip then besieged and captured Potidea, thus marking the beginning of true hostilities with Athens.Plutarch. Alexander, 3. As promised, he handed Potidea over to the Olynthians, and let the Athenian garrison depart freely back to Athens, since he did not want to cause undue offence to the Athenians (\\"he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens on account of the importance and repute of their city\\"). The Athenians were by this time fully engaged in fighting the Social War, and were unable to respond effectively to Philip's moves against Potidea and Pydna. Alliance against Philip (356‚Äì352 BC) Genealogical tree of the Odrysian kings of Thrace In 356 BC, in response to King Philip's machinations, the Athenians allied with the kings of Illyria, Paionia and Thrace, to try to block his advance. Thrace was by now ruled by three kings, descendants of Cotys; in the west was Ketriporis, the son of Berisades (Cotys's second son); in the centre, Amadokos II (Cotys's third son), and in the east Kersebleptes (Cotys's first son). Whether Athens allied to all three Thracian kings is a matter of conjecture; certainly at least Ketriporis joined the alliance... If Kersebleptes did ally with Athens, he appears to have relatively quickly cast off this allegiance, in favour of extending his realm at the expense of Amadokos and Ketriporis.. In Illyria, Bardylis' defeat meant a shift in the hegemony among tribes, with the Grabaei led by Grabos becoming the main power after the defeat of the Dardanii of Bardylis. According to Diodorus, Philip marched on his enemies in this alliance before they had chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead.Diodorus, XVI.22 . However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers over the next few years, with the exception of Athens. According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, shortly after the conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon.. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have defeated the Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War. The victory consolidated Philip's control of Upper Macedon. The small, autonomous principalities like Elimiotis and Lynkestis seems to have been integrated the following year, with the former kings being striped of their titles and reduced to part of Phillip's court.Plutarch, Apophthegmata 179; Athens. xiii. 557.The Marshals of Alexander's Empire by Waldemar Heckel (1992), page 223, Carney, E. D. (1980). Alexander the Lyncestian: The disloyal opposition. Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, 21(1), 23-33. Philip also founded Heraclea Lyncestis as a new urban center in the area. Philip II surrounded Macedon with vassals or subjects allies to replace the coalition he defeated. North of Macedon, the Paionians of the king Lycceius were vassals. The Thracian tribe of the agrianes, neighbors of Paioia, and their king, Langarus, also appear from 352 as allies of Philip and were and from that moment on a relevant support of the Macedonian army.Ashley, p. 45-46. To the northeast, the Thracian kingdom of Ketriporis was also a vassal. To the northwest, the defeated Grabaei were now a buffer state between Macedon and tribes non- subject to Philip, like the Taulantii. The victory against Grabos took place at the same time of the birth of Philips heir, Alexander, son of Myrtale (who changed her name to Olympias), which may also cemented the alliance with Epirus in the southwest. In the following years Olympias' brother, also Alexander, took refuge in Philip's court and the Macedonian influence increased from 351. Some scholars date from 350 the Macedonian direct control of Tymphaea, another border area between Epirus and Macedon. Krinides (356 BC) In 356 BC, whilst Parmenion campaigned against the Illyrians, Philip campaigned in Thrace, and captured the town of Krinides, which had been founded by Thasos in 360 BC. He changed the name to Philippi, after himself, and greatly increased the population. He also greatly improved the gold mines in the surrounding area, the effects of which are described by Diodorus: The capture of Krinides was thus, in the long term, a very significant event in Philip's rise to power. Maroneia and Abdera (c. 355 BC) Polyaenus recounts that Philip attacked and sacked the cities of Abdera and Maroneia along the coast of Thrace. This occurred during a single campaign, but does not say when.Polyaenus, IV.2.22. Diodorus does not mention this campaign, making its position within the overall chronology difficult to place. Buckler suggests the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), together with the Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the report about the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet off the coast of Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It is not entirely clear what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere. Conversely, Cawkwell and Sealey suggest the Maroneia campaign was in 353 BC (though without explicit justification). The Maroneia campaign might therefore have been part of the campaign that Philip fought against Cetriporis (probably 355 BC), or a campaign against Amadokos (probably 353 BC). Siege of Methone (c. 354 BC) The chronology for activities in Greece during the years 355‚Äì352 BC is not entirely clear (see below). Philip certainly started besieging Methone, the last Athenian possession in Macedon, during this period, but different historians choose different dates for this siege.. There are two main theories, either 355‚Äì354 BC, as favoured by, for instance, Buckler, or 354‚Äì353 BC, as favoured by Cawkwell.. Philip began the siege, but was frustrated in his attempt to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year.. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each.Diodorus, XVI.34 . Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible. Summary to c. 354 BC By 354/353 BC, in just 5 years since his accession, Philip had unified Macedon and turned it into the dominant power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready money to pay for more troops. This rapid rise in the power of Macedon was in part due to Philip's exceptional military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also in part due to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had too many other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC. Thessaly and the Sacred War (356‚Äì352 BC) Background The Third Sacred War (often just called 'the' Sacred War) broke out in 356 BC, and would present Philip with his first real opportunity to expand his influence into the affairs of central and southern Greece.,. The war was ostensibly caused by the refusal of the Phocian Confederation to pay a fine imposed on them in 357 BC by the Amphictyonic League, a pan-Greek religious organisation which governed the most sacred site in Ancient Greece, the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.. Behind the religious element, there probably lay a display of realpolitik in bringing charges against the Phocians, instigated by the Thebans. At this time, Thebes controlled a majority of the votes in the council, and at the autumn meeting in 357 BC, the Thebans were able to have both the Phocians (for the cultivation of the sacred land) and the Spartans (for occupying Thebes some 25 years previously) denounced and fined.. Since the fines for both parties were \\"unjustifiably harsh\\", the Thebans probably expected neither party to pay, and thus to be able to declare a \\"sacred war\\" on either. The ruins of ancient Delphi In response, the Phocians, under the leadership of Philomelos, seized Delphi (which was situated within the boundaries of Phocis), and asserted the ancient claim of Phocis to the presidency of the Amphictyonic League,. intending to annul the judgment against themselves.. There seems to have been some sympathy in Greece for the Phocians, since other states could see that \\"the Thebans ... had used the Amphictyony to pursue petty and destructive vendettas\\".. The Phocians were supported by Athens (perennial enemies of Thebes) and unsurprisingly Sparta, who hoped to see their own fine wiped out when the Phocians seized Delphi.. However, Philomelos plundered the treasury of Apollo to pay for mercenaries, thus raising a powerful army, but drastically altering the opinion of the other Greek states.. In winter 356/355 BC, a \\"sacred war\\" was declared against the Phocians by the Amphictyonic council, with the Thebans being the major protagonists. The war started relatively well for the Phocians, but a severe defeat was inflicted on the Phocians at Neon by the Thebans in either 355 or 354 BC, and Philomelos was killed. Undeterred, Onomarchus took over the Phocian effort, and raised new mercenaries to carry on the fight. Chronology of the Sacred War :For further information on this topic, see Third Sacred War (section 'Chronology\\") The ancient sources for the sacred war are scant, and generally lacking in firm chronological information. Modern historians' dates for the war have therefore been hotly debated, with no clear consensus. It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the only firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC for the beginning of the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi. After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; as has been discussed, Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his outward journey. Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone. Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC. However, Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused‚Äîhe dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates‚Äîand his dates cannot therefore be relied upon. Disregarding the dates, most historians agree upon the same sequence of events for this part of the Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355‚Äì354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.. First campaign in Thessaly The Sacred War appears to have laid way for renewed conflict within Thessaly. The Thessalian Confederation were in general staunch supporters of the Amphictyonic League, and had an ancient hatred of the Phocians. Conversely, Pherae had allied itself with the Phocians.. In either 354 or 353 BC, the Aleuadae appealed to Philip to help them defeat Pherae. Philip responded positively, perhaps unsurprisingly: Philip thus brought an army into Thessaly, probably with the intention of attacking Pherae. Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onomarchus dispatched his brother, Phayllos with 7000 men; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans.. Onomarchus then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip. It is possible that Onomarchus hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over.. Onomarchus probably brought with him 20,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army. The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchus seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process.Diodorus, XVI.35 .. Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchus' victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as they climbed a slope to attack the Phocians.Polyaenus, II.38.1. After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter. He is said to have commented that he \\"did not run away but, like a ram, I pulled back to butt again harder\\".. Second campaign in Thessaly Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him in the war against the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army.. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry. Pagasae At some point during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip captured the strategic port of Pagasae,Diodorus, XVI.31 . which was in effect the port of Pherae.. It is unclear whether this was during the first or second campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.. Battle of Crocus Field Bust of Isocrates; plaster cast in the Pushkin Museum of the bust formerly at Villa Albani, Rome Meanwhile, Onomarchus returned to Thessaly to try and preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year. Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched Chares to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip. Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived. According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea (the 'crocus field'), probably in the vicinity of Pagasae. Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; \\"as if he was the avenger ... of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god\\".Justin, VIII.2. Some of the Phocian mercenaries supposedly threw down their arms, panged by their guilty consciences. In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6000 Phocian troops had been killed including Onormarchus, and another 3000 taken prisoner. Onomarchus was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as was the ritual punishment demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians.. Buckler states that: \\"Nor should one automatically assume that a mass-drowning ... would shock the Greek world. Even the mild-tempered Isocrates felt that the Phocian mercenaries were better off dead than alive ... Dreadful indeed was the punishment, but it was entirely consistent with Philip's role as Apollo's champion\\". Re-organisation of Thessaly It was probably in the aftermath of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip archon of Thessaly.. This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thessalian army.. Philip was now able to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He probably first finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly. Pagasae was not part of the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it.. The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis. Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he tightened his control of Perrhaebia, and invaded Magnesia, also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; \\"when finished, he was lord of Thessaly.\\". Thermopylae Once satisfied with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defence of the pass in one of his speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries.. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.. Summary to 352 BC Cawkwell describes 352 BC as Philip's annus mirabilis.. His appointment to high command in Thessaly was a dramatic increase in his power,. effectively giving him a whole new army. His actions as the \\"avenger\\" and \\"saviour\\" of Apollo were calculated to win him goodwill amongst the Greeks in general.. As a result of Philip's increased power and influence, Worthington suggests that by the time of Demosthenes' \\"First Philippic\\" (351 BC), Philip was already unstoppable in his aim to control Greece.. Strategic situation The stalemate at Thermopylae pointed the future direction of the ongoing conflict between Philip and the Athenians. Athens was a significant naval power, whilst Macedon had no real navy to speak of. Conversely, Macedon had a very powerful army, especially with the addition of the Thessalians after 352 BC, which Athens could not hope to match.. The Athenians could therefore prevent Philip attacking Athens by sea, but not by land‚Äîunless they could occupy Thermopylae in time.. The pass was narrow enough to make troop numbers irrelevant, and could only be bypassed with some difficulty, meaning the Athenians could hope to resist Philip there; Thermopylae therefore became the key position in the conflict. The Athenians also began to realise that they could not hope to reclaim Amphipolis, or defeat Philip, and must instead act on the defensive; as Demosthenes said: \\"the war at the outset was concerned with taking revenge on Philip, now at its conclusion with not suffering at Philip's hands\\".. From Philip's point of view, once he controlled Amphipolis, he could operate in the North Aegean unimpeded, especially if he campaigned during the Etesian winds, or in winter, when the Athenian navy could do little to stop him.. However, he could not easily advance into Greece, to attack Athens for instance, if Thermopylae was held against him. Thrace (353‚Äì352 BC) Most historians agree that Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, but what exactly he achieved is a matter of some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC.. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC. In the early part of 352 BC several key events had occurred in, or around Thrace which challenged Philip's influence in the region.. The Athenian general Chares captured Sestos, on the Thracian Chersonese early in the year, probably taking the city from Kersebleptes. The Athenians had a long-standing interest in the Chersonese for strategic reasons, and it had formed a significant part of their 'Empire' in the 5th century BC.. Firstly, Athens depended largely on the import of grain from the Crimea for her food supply; controlling the Chersonese helped to ensure that supplies could safely pass through the Hellespont. Secondly, the Chersonese was used as a place to settle the excess citizenry of Athens, usually in the form of cleruchies, colonies which were not politically independent of the mother city. After the capture of Sestos, Kersebleptes, who up until now had resisted Athenian attempts to reclaim the Chersonese, now came to terms with Athens. He was probably now worried about Philip's influence in the region, and thus sought to ally with the Athenians, giving them control of all the cities of the Chersonese except Cardia. Furthermore, the Chalkidian League also seems to have turned against Philip in 352 BC, presumably also concerned by his designs on their territory, and sought peace with Athens. Philip probably also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly after returning to Macedon from Thessaly.. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, on the coast of the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC).. On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It seems clear that Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.  Olynthian War (349‚Äì348 BC) As discussed, the Chalkidian League had made peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, the next few years of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC.. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos.Justin, VIII.3. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League. Ruins of ancient Olynthos Philip finally began his campaign against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly at or near Stageira).Diodorus, XVI.52 . Philip seems to have methodically worked his way around the 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna‚Äîa small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos‚Äîhaving seen the fate of the cities which resisted Philip.. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory. Finally, in probably June 348 BC, with all the other cities captured or in submission, Philip moved to attack Olynthos. According to Diodorus, there were two pitched battles against the Olynthians; after being defeated twice, the Olynthians were then confined to the city.Diodorus, XVI.53 . Two of the commanders of Olynthos, Euthycrates and Lasthenes, defected to Philip with 500 cavalry shortly before the siege. Diodorus therefore claims that the city fell by treachery; certainly treachery was committed, but it is not clear that this is how the city was captured. Either way, by September the siege was over, and the Chalkidian league had been annihilated. Philip razed the city, and sold the remaining inhabitants into slavery; the same fate awaited the other Chalkidian cities that had not submitted to him.. Philip then incorporated Chalkidike into the Macedonian state, distributing the land amongst his followers. Athens and the Olynthian War When Philip began his attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave a series of speeches, now known as the Olynthiacs, encouraging the Athenians to resist Philip.. The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual ascendancy of Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make him seem more important than he was.; . In the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as peltasts, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians.. Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under Chares, possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, it is not clear whether this force achieved anything. Later, in early 348 BC, the Olynthians appealed for help again. The Athenians sent Charidemos, a former general of Kersebleptes who had been adopted as an Athenian citizen, with 4000 peltasts, 150 cavalry and 18 triremes; of the triremes, 10 were probably already in his service, and the other 8 may have been those sent to Chares in 349 BC. Charidemus joined up with the Olynthians, and together they attacked the former territory of Olynthos in western Chalkidike. Finally, just before the final siege of Olynthos started, the Olynthians appealed a last time for aid. The Athenians prepared to send a force of citizen hoplites, but they were delayed by the weather, probably due to the Etesian winds, and arrive too late to achieve anything. Euboea Athens was prevented from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought to unite the cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning the end of the hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae.. The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea. In early 348 BC, the Athenians were distracted by events on Euboea, and were in no position to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island.. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines... End of the Sacred War (347‚Äì346 BC) The Athenian politician Philocrates had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war.. However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, and by the time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands.. Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance.. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war‚Äîhe desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms. Bust of Archidamus III from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, now in the Naples National Archaeological Museum In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around 14 February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamos III with 1000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.. Peace with Athens When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement.. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they had little choice but to accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis. End of Thracian independence Following the first Athenian embassy to Macedon, Philip went on campaign against Kersebleptes. Details of the campaign are scarce, but it seems that Philip easily captured the Thracian treasury on the \\"Sacred Mountain\\". Then, rather than deposing Kersebleptes, he made him a subject ally, in the same manner as his brother Amadokos. Settlement of the Sacred War After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip.. When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principal combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.. When Philip returned from Thrace he received all these embassies. The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis. Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; \\"[he] sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand\\"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates.. Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against Halos, a small Thessalian city which held out against him. He departed for Halos before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home. It was now that Philip applied the coup de grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy,. and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace.. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms of the end of the Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for him being allowed to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished.. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes;. allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.. A gold half stater of Philip II of Macedon minted at Pella, with the head of young Heracles wearing the Nemean Lion's skin on the obverse and on the reverse the lion's forepart In return for ending the war, Macedon was made a member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been stripped from Phocis.. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes.. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip had no choice but to impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; the Phocians were not, however, destroyed, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly.. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning the closest town to Thermopylae, Nicaea with Thessalian troops. Summary to 346 BC 346 BC was another remarkable year for Philip. The city-states of Greece had exhausted themselves in the previous years, and Philip was therefore the only power capable of finally ending the Sacred War. Ultimately, once in control of Thermopylae, this military strength allowed him to settle the war by mere threat of force.. Philip undoubtedly intended to settle the war even before the Thessalians and Thebans requested that he do so, and the terms on which the war was concluded were presumably much as he would have desired; coming to a separate peace with Athens was a bonus.. Philip was, through his membership of the Amphictyonic council, now legitimized as a \\"true\\" Greek; and by the prestige he had gained for his pious conduct on behalf of Apollo, and by his military strength, he was now the de facto leader of the Greek city-states.. Simon Hornblower suggests that Philip was the only real victor in the Sacred War. Furthermore, Philip's domination of northern Greece and the north Aegean was now almost complete, after his success in the Olynthian War and his subjugation of Kersebleptes. Diodorus sums up Philip's achievements in 346 BC: There has been much debate amongst historians about Philip's motives and aims in 346 BC, with particular regard to Athens. Although Philip had made peace and alliance with Athens prior to his settlement of the Sacred War, they failed to send him troops he requested under the terms of the alliance.. Although these troops were not ultimately needed by Philip, the Athenian failure to honour the terms gave Philip reasonable grounds for war. However, even when in possession of Thermopylae, he made no hostile moves towards Athens, and still prevented any punishment being meted on Athens by the Amphictyonic council. Why was Philip so lenient towards Athens? Cawkwell suggests that Philip was already beginning to contemplate a campaign against Persia in 346 BC (as tentatively suggested by Diodorus), for which purposes he desired the use of the powerful Athenian navy; hence his request for alliance, and his on-going patience with Athens. This may also provide another explanation for Philip's use of the Amphictyonic council to formally settle the Sacred War; if he was to campaign in Asia, he needed Greece to be peaceful, and a peace imposed through a pan-Greek organisation (backed with the threat of Macedonian intervention), was more likely to succeed than one directly imposed by Macedon. Reorganisation and retrenchment (345‚Äì342 BC) Niketerion (victory medallion) bearing the effigy of king Philip II of Macedon, 3rd century AD, probably minted during the reign of Roman Emperor Severus Alexander. The next year, Philip returned to the ongoing business of restructuring Macedon. Justin reports that after returning to Macedon, he began transplanting parts of the population to new locations, in particular strengthening the cities of Macedon.. This was probably to increase the security of the population, and promote trade; Alexander the Great would later recall that his father had brought \\"the Macedonians down from the hills to the plains\\". Illyria (345 BC) Philip then went on campaign against the Illyrians, particularly Pleuratus, whose Taulantii kingdom probably lay along the Drin river in modern Albania and was the main independent power in Illyria after Grabus' defeat. During the campaign, Philip suffered a smashed shin-bone, and was only saved from death by the bravery of his Companion cavalry (150 of whom were wounded in the process). Philip did not campaign in 344 or 343 BC, which may have been due to the effects of this severe injury.. Instead, Philip contented himself with reorganising Thessaly in 344 BC, reinstating the ancient fourfold \\"Tetrarchic\\" administration system. After the campaign the Dardanii tribe, ruled by Bardylis' son Cleitus, was a vassal of Philip. The previously defeated grabaei, as well as perhaps the ardiaei and autariatae are usually considered vassals of Philip, although the evidence is weak. The taulantii were probably expelled from the border area of Dassaretia,The Illyrians to the Albanians - Neritan Ceka pg.83 but after the harsh battle against Philip they remained independent in the Jonic coast. Molossia and Cassopaea (342 BC) The Molossian kingdom of Epirus had been an important subject ally of Macedon since 350 BC, when Philip had taken the son of king Arybbas, Alexander hostage. During this time at court, Alexander (brother of Philip's wife Olympias), had grown into an admirer of Philip, and Philip therefore decided to replace Arybbas with Alexander. The exact date this occurred is unclear; Cawkwell suggests this happened in early 342 BC, when Alexander would have been 20, as a prelude to his Thracian campaign. Arybbas went into exile in Athens, where he was promised help to regain his kingdom; however, Alexander would remain on the throne (and loyal to Philip) until his death in 334 BC.. Philip certainly campaigned against the Epirote Cassopaeans in early 342 BC, taking control of three coastal cities (Pandosia, Elateia and Bucheta) to secure the southern regions of his kingdom. Thrace (342‚Äì340 BC) In approximately June 342 BC, Philip set off on what must have been a long-planned expedition into Thrace.. The campaign was to last for two years, but other than that his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details. Undoubtedly Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all... Philip ended the campaign by marrying Meda of Odessos, daughter of a king of the Getae, which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the Hebrus, and north of the Great Balkan range of mountains, near the Danube. During the campaign, Philip founded several cities, most notably Philippopolis on the site of the old Thracian fort of Eumolpia (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). A tithe was levied on the Thracians, and the new post of \\"general in charge of Thrace\\" may have been established at this time, effectively governor of a new Macedonian province of Thrace. To the north of this pacified region, the Thracians were left mostly independent, under their own kings, who were subject to Philip. Cawkwell rates this extended campaign as one of Philip's major achievements, given the terrain and severe winter conditions. Perinthos and Byzantion (340‚Äì339 BC) At the end of his Thracian campaign, Philip moved against the city of Perinthos, formerly his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, there is no indication that this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.. Another point of conflict may have been Thassos and the north Aegean piracy. The weakening of Athens' naval hegemony and the use of privateers in the last war had led to a resurgence of piracy.. Philip's navy had occupied the small island of Halonnesus in the northern Aegean after expelling the pirates who had seized the island. Its return during the Philocrates peace had been a diplomatic claim by the orator Hegesippus, a Demosthenes supporter.. In general, the antimacedonian party had allowed or promoted the use of the island of Thassos, in front of the Macedonian and Thracian coastline, as a pirate safe harbor.. The Athenians also made similar use of other islands and ports in Thrace.. The island internal politics were divided between pro and antiathenian parties with their continental interests having been seized by Philip during his earlier conquests. Demosthenes refers to Thasos as independent in 340 but the subsequent references to Thassos had been construed by scholars like Rubensohn as suggesting it may have fallen to Philip in 340‚Äì338.. Breakdown of the Peace Bust of the Athenian politician Demosthenes Although Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates, almost as soon as it was made, he wished to be rid of it. Over the next few years, Demosthenes became leader of the \\"war-party\\" in Athens, and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace: \\"His method was simple and effective. He kept hammering away at untruths until enough Athenians came to believe them.\\" Demosthenes believed that all Philip's successes were due to his bribery and corruption of the Greeks, a view which, although there is little evidence for it, became commonplace until re-examined by modern historians.. Conversely, there was also a substantial body of feeling in Athens, led by Aeschines, that the peace should be maintained and developed.. From 343 BC onwards, in order to try and disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace... Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of Cardia, an ally of Philip.. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, there was no need to do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea.. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.. Perinthos Against this fraught background, Philip started the siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos occupied a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip did not have a large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city.. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of the wall was breached. However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of soldiers and their best generals. Byzantion The Byzantians' actions meant that they too were now at war with Philip. He continued the siege of Perinthos, but now (September) sent half his army to besiege Byzantion. Byzantion was a more important city for Philip, because of its control of the Bosphorus; Demosthenes was determined to prevent the capture of the city, and went on an embassy to Byzantion, which agreed to form an alliance with Athens. The Athenians general Chares was already in the vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, made all the more difficult by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war.. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion. The first act in this new war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting on the far side of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares.. He used the grain for his own supplies and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion.. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion. Philip's final campaigns (339‚Äì338 BC) Scythia As a prelude to his planned campaign in Greece, Philip went on campaign in the winter of 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja).. He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC. Fourth Sacred War Philip's campaign in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided to declare a sacred war against Amphissa.. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to campaign in Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway. Map showing Philip's movements during 339‚Äì338 BC. At the start of the 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip does not appear to have treated this as a declaration of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available. In 480 BC, during the Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian king Xerxes had sent his army via a mountain track (the Anopea) to outflank the pass. From this track, on the western side of Mount Kallidromon, another road led off and descended in Phocis. In 480 BC, a thousand Phocian troops were stationed above Thermopylae to guard the road and prevent a Persian assault on Phocis (though they notably failed to prevent the Persians using Anopea). However, in 339 BC, the Greeks had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered.. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re- populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi.. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try and avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful. The Amphictyonic council decided to hold a special session two or three months later. The Athenians and the Thebans did not send envoys to this council. Alliance between Athens and Thebes When news first arrived that Philip was in Elatea, just three days march away, there was panic in Athens.. In what Cawkwell describes as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counselled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, in the cause of liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed. The details of the campaign leading up to the decisive Battle of Chaeronea are almost completely unknown.. Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helikon, as the Spartans had done in the run-up to the Battle of Leuctra, or by any of the other mountain passes. There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes; Demosthenes alludes to a \\"winter battle\\" and \\"battle on the river\\" in his speeches, but no other details are preserved. Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the allied Greek army defending the road at Chaeronea. The Battle of Chaeronea The Lion of Chaeronea, erected by the Thebans to honor the dead from the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), described by the ancient geographer Pausanias and discovered by the British architect George Ledwell Taylor in the early 19th century. The allied Greek army had taken up a position near Chaeronea, astride the main road.. On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara and Troezen, with the majority of troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self- governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern view is that the allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.Diodorus, XVI.85 . Philip took command of the right wing of the Macedonian wing and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals. Details of the battle itself are scarce, with Diodorus providing the only formal account. He says that \\"once joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides, so that for a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both.\\"Diodorus, XVI.86. He then recounts that the young Alexander, \\"his heart set on showing his father his prowess\\" succeeding in rupturing the allied Greek line aided by his companions, and eventually put the allied Greek right wing to flight; meanwhile, Philip advanced in person against the allied Greek left and also put it to flight. This brief account can be filled out, if Polyaenus's anecdotes related to the battle (found in his work Strategems) are to be believed. Polyaenus's accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis of the battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre.. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the allied Greek right and punched a hole in the allied Greek line. On the allied Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and became disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The allied Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then were also routed, ending the battle. Diodorus says that more than 1000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history; since there was now no army which could prevent Philip's advance, the war effectively ended. Settlement of Greece and League of Corinth (337‚Äì336 BC) In the aftermath of Chaeronea, records show desperate attempts in Athens and Corinth to re-build the city walls, as they prepared for Philip to lay siege to them.. However, Philip had no intention of besieging any city, nor indeed of conquering Greece. Himself also being Greek, he wanted the rest of the Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians, and he wanted to leave a stable Greece in his rear when he went on campaign; further fighting was therefore contrary to his aims. Philip marched first to Thebes, which surrendered to him; he expelled the Theban leaders who had opposed him, recalled those pro-Macedonian Thebans who had previously been exiled, and installed a Macedonian garrison.. He also ordered that the Boeotian cities of Plataea and Thespiae, which Thebes had destroyed in previous conflicts, be re- founded. Generally, Philip treated the Thebans severely, making them pay for the return of their prisoners, and even to bury their dead; he did not, however, dissolve the Boeotian confederacy. By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; although the Second Athenian League was dissolved, the Athenians were allowed to keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom.. Philip's motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons.. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely to take advantage of the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese.. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself. League of Corinth Philip seems to have moved around Greece in the months after the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and installing garrisons; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, lest they oppose him. In mid-337 BC, he seems to have camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed in the latter half of 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta.. The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs.. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'. At Philip's behest, the synod of the League then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign. War with Persia and death of Philip (336 BC) The golden larnax that was buried with Philip II of Macedon in his tomb at Vergina (Aigai), featuring the Vergina Sun design, the royal symbol of the Argead dynasty. In 336 BC, whilst the invasion of Persia was in its very early stage, Philip was assassinated in Aegae by the captain of his bodyguard, Pausanias, whilst attending the wedding of his daughter by Olympias, Cleopatra, to Olympias's brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of Epirus. Philip's son Alexander III by Olympias was proclaimed king by the Macedonian army and by the Macedonian noblemen... Aftermath Accession of Alexander Bust of a young Alexander the Great from the Hellenistic period, British Museum Alexander began his reign by having his potential rivals to the throne murdered. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed, as well as having two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed, while a third, Alexander Lyncestes, was spared. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and her daughter by Philip, Europa, burned alive. When Alexander found out about this, he was furious with his mother. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor. Attalus was at the time in correspondence with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Regardless of whether Attalus actually intended to defect, he had already severely insulted Alexander, and having just had Attalus's daughter and grandchildren murdered, Alexander probably felt Attalus was too dangerous to leave alive.. Alexander spared the life of his half-brother Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts somewhat mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias..Plutarch. Alexander, 77.. News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolts in Greece reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though his advisors advised him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's neighbor to the south. When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had the men ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear, and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force, as he rode down towards the Peloponnesus.; ; . Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. At Corinth, he was given the title Hegemon, and like Philip, appointed commander of the forthcoming war against Persia. Balkan campaign Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders; in the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several apparent revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he first went east into the country of the \\"Independent Thracians\\", and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a Thracian army manning the heights.Arrian, I.1. The Macedonians marched on into the country of the Triballi, and proceeded to defeat the Triballian army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube).Arrian, I.2. Alexander then advanced for three days on to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Surprising the Getae by crossing the river at night, he forced the Getae army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish, leaving their town to the Macedonian army.Arrian, I.3‚Äì4; . News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, king of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against Macedonian authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their armies, leaving Alexander's northern frontier secure.Arrian, I.5‚Äì6; . While he was triumphantly campaigning in the north, a rumour of his death caused the Thebans and Athenians to rebel against Macedonian hegemony once more. Alexander reacted immediately but, while the other cities hesitated when he advanced into Greece, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor. However, the resistance was useless, and the city was captured and then razed to the ground, and its territory was divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander.Plutarch. Phocion, 17. With Macedon's vassals and allies once again peaceable, Alexander was finally free to take control of the stalled war with Persia, and in early 334 BC he crossed with an army of 42,000 men into Asia Minor. Alexander's campaigns in Asia Alexander's 10-year campaign in Asia, and the Macedonian conquest of the Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule over most of the territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.

The channel became known as the \\"PBS of religion\\" for the inclusive nature of its programming, which was designed to \\"place its accent on dialogue rather than apologies.\\" In 1992, VISN began sharing channel space with a similarly formatted cable network, the American Christian Television System, with the two being co-branded under the name VISN-ACTS. The unified channel later evolved into the Faith & Values Channel and Odyssey, before eventually relaunching (with minimal religious content) as the Hallmark Channel in 2001 following its purchase by Crown Media Holdings. Throughout the latter portion of the 1990s, the channel hosted a continuously diminishing roster of religious programming. Background VISN was founded in late 1987 by the National Interfaith Cable Coalition (NICC). The NICC was an interfaith foundation created to provide programming and guidance to VISN. Many of the initial members of the NICC were also members of the National Council of Churches, whose membership had experienced trouble keeping airtime for local religious programming following media deregulation in the 1980s. Startup costs for VISN were covered by several cable providers; spearheaded by Tele- Communications Inc., early financial backers of the channel included American Television & Communications, United Cable, Jones Intercable, Post-Newsweek Cable and Heritage Communications. The network was owned by the NICC and Liberty Media, a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc. Although the network was advertiser-supported, it disallowed on-air solicitation during its programming. In part, the network was created as a response to the televangelist scandals of Oral Roberts, Jim Bakker and Bakker's PTL Satellite Network, and the general popularity of conservative religious television such as the Christian Broadcasting Network. Another goal of the network was to help ease the crowding of local cable networks by combining their programming onto one channel. This goal was enumerated by Robert Thomson of founding company Tele-Communications Inc., who stated that \\"no operator has the capacity for a separate channel for each denomination.\\" The Vision Interfaith Satellite Network launched on July 1, 1988. At its launch, the NICC was represented by 23 faith groups covering all branches of Christianity. In addition, certain existing channels were represented with the inaugural members of the NICC, among them, the Gospel Music Network. The group hoped to have a potential audience reach of 35 to 40 million subscribers by the network's fifth year of operation. VISN reached 6.4 million cable television subscribers by 1990. The network continued to expand rapidly, reaching 12.8 million subscribers by 1992. By that year, VISN represented 54 faith groups including a full range of Christian denominations from Episcopalians to Latter Day Saints, to non- Christian groups such as Buddhists and Muslims. In late 1992, VISN merged with the American Christian Television System, a network owned by the Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission. Both networks would share the same satellite transponder (and effectively, channel space), but the two networks would remain independently owned, run their own programming and maintain separate on-air identities. The ACTS network brought in 8.2 million subscribers, increasing VISN's total national coverage to about 20 million households. The combined network was branded as VISN-ACTS. VISN-ACTS was rebranded as the Faith & Values Channel in 1993, with its programming being refocused to include more news and information content. In 1995, originating founding sponsor Tele-Communications Inc purchased a 49% ownership stake in the channel, and began to rebuild its programming with a focus on family- oriented entertainment, eliminating all preaching programs. VISN had long been pressured by the competition created by other religious networks in cable markets. Longtime rivals included the Trinity Broadcasting Network, the Eternal Word Television Network and FamilyNet. In 1995, the Trinity Broadcasting Network called the Faith and Values Channel \\"a failed experiment in religious programming\\", stating that its overarching approach to faiths and entertainment programming hurt its efforts at attracting viewers. By 1996, the channel's programming was such that it was said to eschew its own religious label. Citing poor growth, the channel was relaunched as the Odyssey Network in August 1996 and given the slogan \\"Exploring Life's Journey\\". At the time of the relaunch, the channel's subscriber reach potential had increased to 25.6 million households, and the NICC espoused representatives from 65 faith groups. The network continued to have problems throughout the late 1990s. External competition from Pax TV and CBS, the need for internal harmony, and general funding issues kept the channel from acquiring the rights to high quality programs such as Touched by an Angel and Nothing Sacred. The channel sought new partners to rectify the situation, striking deals with The Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment in 1998. Odyssey's 1999 relaunch refocused the network's programming to include more family and values-oriented entertainment programming and even less direct religious content. Odyssey was relaunched as the Hallmark Channel on August 5, 2001, featuring substantially reduced religious content. By this point, the channel was available to 30 million cable and satellite subscribers throughout the United States. The Southern Baptist Convention pulled ACTS out of the network in 2003 and withdrew from the NICC. Faith & Values Media, a production company owned by the NICC, continues to produce content both for television and the internet. The corporation retains about 5% of the Hallmark Channel and has a long-term contract with the network. In 2007, a subsidiary of Faith & Values Media acquired the ecumenical internet discussion forum Ecunet.

In September 2018 Bath and North East Somerset Council started an informal consultation on a proposal to partially pedestrianise the square. Buildings Number 12, 13 and 14 is made up of Rosewell House, which forms one building with Numbers 1 and 2 Kingsmead Street. The house is named after T Rosewell, who commissioned it from Strahan and whose sign, a rose and a well, can be seen on the baroque facade with the date 1736. It is a three- storey building with a mansard roof. The ground floor has been changed to include shop fronts, but a detached Ionic porch can still be seen. Dr Joseph Butler Bishop of Durham theologian, apologist, and philosopher died at Rosewell House 1752. Originally Rosewell House was the end of a rank of houses, but neighbouring 11, 12 and 13 Kingsmead Square were demolished to make New Street on a diagonal alignment out of the square to provide better access to the new Bath Green Park railway station. At the centre of the square is a large London Plane tree, about 20 metres tall. The square has full public access, with a ground surface of concrete slabs and cobbles.

He was a lifelong friend and supporter of Jos√© Sanjurjo, senior of the three generals who launched the coup of July 1936 that started the Spanish Civil War. When Sanjurjo needed to be flown in from Portugal, he chose Ansaldo as his pilot. But the overloaded plane crashed on take-off, killing the general. Ansaldo would later fall from grace with Franco, and would go into exile. Monarchism Born in Aretxabaleta, Gipuzkoa into a noble family - his father was the Viscount of San Enrique - Ansaldo joined the army to fight in the Rif War. He remained until 1931 and the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, retiring with the rank of major.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990. p. 12 A great admirer of Charles Maurras and Action Fran√ßaise,Eugen Weber, Action Fran√ßaise: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France, 1962, p. 384 he flirted with various shades of far right politics before and during the Spanish Civil War. A member of Ramiro de Maeztu's Acci√≥n Espa√±ola, he was a devoted follower of the monarchist general Jos√© Sanjurjo.Paul Preston, Franco, London, 1995, p. 89 By 1932 Ansaldo's holiday home in Biarritz was playing host to various leading monarchists, and this group grew close to the Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola, which was planning to overthrow the republican government.Preston, Franco, p. 91-2 He was also a founder and leading member of Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola, another group dedicated to restoring the monarchy in the Alfonsist tendency. Ansaldo visited Fascist Italy the same year in an attempt to drum up support for the conspiracy, particularly from Italo Balbo, with whom he had contact. He and Jos√© Calvo Sotelo would make a return visit the following year, although neither trip produced any concrete results. However in Ansaldo's efforts in this and other areas did raise a total of 3 million pesetas to fund the conspiracy. In 1934 Ansaldo was at the centre of a coup plot when it was arranged for him to fly Sanjurjo back from exile in Portugal. The plan was for Sanjurjo to link up with Juan Yag√ºe and to lead a coup. However whilst the plotters waited at philologist Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez's house word came through from Francisco Franco that the time was not right and so Ansaldo's mission was abandoned.Preston, Franco, p. 107 He was again called into action in July 1936 when it appeared that Franco was wavering in his command and General Emilio Mola ordered Ansaldo to pick up Sanjurjo from Portugal and fly him to Morocco to relieve Franco of his command. The plan was again abandoned however when Franco returned to action a few days later.Preston, Franco, p. 136 Fascism Although a monarchist, Ansaldo was drawn to the violent action and adventurism of fascism and as such maintained close links with such groups. He helped to fund both the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista and the Movimiento Sindicalista Espa√±ola in the early 1930s, personally favouring the latter movement, which owed more to Blackshirts of Italian fascism in its character.Stanley G. Payne, Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, 2000, pp. 87-8 With both these groups floundering he turned his attentions instead to the Falange and formally joined the group in early 1934. He became jefe de commandos and took charge of the so-called Falange de la Sangre militia squads engaged in responding to the leftist attacks.Payne, Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, p. 109 In this capacity Ansaldo became noted for his extreme violence, not only preventing any socialist activity in Madrid on May Day 1934 but also for his proclaimed intention of killing any of his own men suspected of betraying the Falange.Stanley G. Payne, Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism, 1961, p. 57 Nonetheless, Ansaldo did not abandon his earlier monarchist principles and hoped to turn the Falange to that ideology. To this end he conspired to edge Primo de Rivera out of his position of leadership, something that led to his expulsion from the movement in 1934. He went into voluntary exile in France after this setback, although continued to be closely involved in monarchist conspiracy from his new base. Sanjurjo crash In late July 1936 Ansaldo was finally called by General Mola to transport his mentor from exile in Estoril. Flying only a small biplane, the flight hit difficulty when Sanjurjo, who was a very heavy man to begin with, insisted on carrying a large amount of luggage with him. Heavily weighed down, the plane crashed just after take-off, killing Sanjurjo.Preston, Franco, p. 151-2 Ansaldo, however, survived the crash, despite suffering extensive injuries.Stanley G. Payne, Politics and the Military in Modern Spain, 1967, p. 352 The incident was to Franco's advantage as one of his two main rivals to power, the other being Mola, was eliminated.Preston, Franco, p. 152 Later years Ansaldo returned to action during the Civil War, serving with the nationalist air force in the northern campaign. Following the Civil War Ansaldo continued his career in the Spanish Air Force and had risen to the rank of colonel by 1940.Preston, Franco, p. 349 He would also serve as an air attach√© to the United Kingdom and then Vichy France. By this time, Ansaldo had become firmly estranged from Franco and was involved in a futile conspiracy with Eugenio Vegas Latapie to restore the monarchy.Stanley G. Payne, The Franco regime, 1936-1975, 1987, p. 294 He launched further clandestine initiatives with Alfredo Kindel√°n and other monarchists when it became clear that Franco had no intention of restoring the monarchy at that time. He was exiled from Spain in 1945 after Franco launched a purge of leading monarchistsPreston, Franco, p. 524 initially to Portugal before returning to France in 1947. His disillusionment with the Franco regime was reflected in his 1951 memoir ¬øPara que... (For What?) in which he criticised El Caudillo for betraying the war against the republicans by not restoring the monarchy.Preston, Franco, p. 686 He died in Ville-d'Avray in 1958.

The 35th book was listed in the back of #34 as Honey Bunch and Norman Visit Cocoa Land.

As would also be done later by the Syndicate with the Dana Girls series, recent titles in the original series were recycled throughout the beginning of the new series.

This may be the last Stratemeyer Syndicate book to be published with a dust jacket, as most of the other Syndicate series seemed to phase them out by 1962. There is a manuscript for the unpublished 13th book, The Wooden Shoe Mystery, at the New York Public Library Cover Designs Although the final book was published in 1963, the books remained in print for several years, though in the picture cover format, as Grosset & Dunlap had completely switched their line of series over from wrap around dust covers to picture covers.Liz Holderman, Dating Nancy Drew Book Formats, Sept 4, 2008 https://www.worthpoint.com/articles/blog- entry/dating-nancy-drew-book-formats It is believed that all 12 books were published in picture cover format. In the 1960s, Grosset & Dunlap had decided, for example with the Judy Bolton series and Connie Blair, not to republish select titles in picture cover format. It is possible this was done with the Honey Bunch and Norman series. Picture cover versions tend to be more difficult to find for this series since more copies were printed with dust jackets. The first 12 books originally had individual cover art for each book by Walter S. Rogers, who was active with several Syndicate Series of the 1910s-1930s (The Bobbsey Twins and Hardy Boys for example). Marie Schubert took over with book 13, providing a more modern fashion than Rogers had used. The Syndicate was moving toward more progressive artwork during this period throughout its popular series. Schubert continued until book 23.Deidre Johnson, \\"Honey Bunch: Creation and History of the Series\\" https://iopn.library.illinois.edu/scalar/thesweetpublicdomain/series-history Book 24 also saw the end of individual cover-artwork, until the series was re- vamped in 1957. From book 25 on, Harry Lane is credited with the cover illustration. The previous books were also re-issued with the new, uniform artwork. Harry Lane's artwork was retired with book 32 of the original series. The correct 31st book, Honey Bunch: Her First Visit to Puppyland, was published in 1952. This book is extremely hard to find. There are 32 Honey Bunch books and 12 Honey Bunch and Norman books. When the series was re-vamped in 1957, individual cover illustrations were returned.

It is sometimes done as a form of elective surgery where the therapeutic goals are to improve the sexual functioning of the patient and the aesthetic refinement of the vulva. It is a form of hoodplasty. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a subordinate surgery within a labiaplasty procedure for reducing the labia minora, and occasionally within a vaginoplasty procedure. Patient surveys have indicated satisfaction with the outcome of such procedures. However, in 2007 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published an opinion advising against representing it as completely safe. Surgical procedures Pudendum femininum: The external anatomy of the vulvo-vaginal complex, indicating the clitoris, the clitoral prepuce, the labia majora, and the labia minora. The procedures for labiaplasty occasionally include a clitoral hood reduction. One technique for reducing the clitoral hood is the bilateral excision (cutting) of the prepuce tissues covering the clitoral glans, with especial attention to maintaining the glans in the midline.Felicio Y. Labial Surgery. Aesthetic Surgery Journal. 2007. 27:3;322‚Äì328. Another technique cuts away (excises) the redundant folds of clitoral prepuce tissue, with incisions parallel to the long axis of the clitoris.Hunter JG. Considerations in Female External Genital Aesthetic Surgery Techniques. Aesthetic Surgery Journal. 2008. 28:1;106‚Äì107. Clitoral hood reduction can be included in the extended wedge resection labiaplasty technique, wherein the extension of the exterior wedge sections is applied to reducing the prepuce tissues of the clitoral glans. Yet, occasionally excess prepuce-skin, in the center of the clitoral hood, is removed with separate incisions.Alter GJ. Aesthetic Labia Minora and Clitoral Hood Reduction Using Extended Central Wedge Resection. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. 2008. 122:6; 1780‚Äì1789. Results Studies have reported a high rate of patient satisfaction with the aesthetic changes to the vulvo-vaginal complex after labioplasty, and a low incidence rate of medical complications.Scholten E. Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery ‚Äî The Future. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery. . The study Aesthetic Labia Minora and Clitoral Hood Reduction using Extended Central Wedge Resection (2008) reported that of a 407-woman cohort, 98 per cent were satisfied with the labial reduction outcomes; that the average patient satisfaction score was 9.2 points on a 10-point scale; that 95 per cent of the women experienced reduced pudendal discomfort; that 93 per cent of the women experienced improved self esteem; that 71 per cent experienced improved sexual functioning; that 0.6 per cent (one woman) reported lessened sexual functioning; and that 4.4 per cent of the women experienced medical complications. The study Expectations and Experience of Labial Reduction: A Qualitative Study (2007) reported that the women who underwent labiaplasty had great expectations for the elimination of pubic discomfort and pain, improved cosmetic appearance of the vulva, and improved sexual functioning. Most of the women experienced improved self esteem; yet the study also reported that formal psychological counselling before the surgical operation about what to expect and what not to expect from a labia minora and clitoral prepuce reduction procedure might better serve the prospective patient by assisting her in establishing realistic expectations for her genital beauty and mental health after such a procedure.  Criticism  Partial or total hoodectomy is classified by the World Health Organization as female genital mutilation (FGM) Type 1A. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published Committee Opinion No. 378: Vaginal \\"Rejuvenation\\" and Cosmetic Vaginal Procedures (2007), the college's formal policy statement of opposition to the commercial misrepresentations of labiaplasty, and associated vaginoplastic procedures, as medically \\"accepted and routine surgical practices\\". The ACOG doubts the medical safety and the therapeutic efficacy of the surgical techniques and procedures for performing vaginoplastic operations such as labiaplasty, vaginal rejuvenation, the designer vagina, revirgination, and G-spot amplification, and recommends that women seeking such genitoplastic surgeries must be fully informed, with the available surgical-safety statistics, of the potential health risks of surgical-wound infection, of pudendal nerve damage (resulting in either an insensitive or an over-sensitive vulva), of dyspareunia (painful coitus), of tissue adhesions (epidermoid cysts), and of painful scars.  Risks  The dorsal nerves of the clitoris travel above the clitoris along the clitoral body. Permanent injury to these nerves can occur with clitoral hood reductions.

Fail-stop languages are often used in computer systems where correctness is very important, since it is easier to make such systems fail- fast. For example, the \\"+\\" operator in many programming languages is not associative because of the possibility of floating-point overflow. Repairing these languages to fail fast when commonly assumed properties do not hold makes it much easier to write and verify correct code. Examples In many widely used programming languages the code below might reduce the bank account value if the deposited amount or old account value is very large, by causing an overflowed value to be assigned to new_bank_account_value. new_bank_account_value = old_bank_account_value + amount_deposited // example calculation with 32-bit signed integers to demonstrate, which overflow above 2,147,483,647 // -2,147,483,646 = 2,147,483,640 + 10 But in a fail-stop language that treats overflow as an exceptional condition, it is either correct, or will terminate with an exceptional condition.

It was probably the first bank in Aberystwyth and was founded soon after the removal of the Custom House from Aberdyfi to Aberystwyth, around 1762. Establishment and partnership agreement On 1 June 1806 an agreement was entered into whereby John Jones, a London-Welsh surgeon and apothecary, of Gracechurch Street, London and Derry Ormond, Ceredigion, Thomas Morgan, an Aberystwyth solicitor and David Davies, of Machynlleth later of Aberystwyth, then of Castle Green House, Cardigan, entered into partnership to carry on for 14 years a banking business under the name Jones, Morgan & Davies.Early Banks in West Wales, by Francis Green (in West Wales Historical Records, The Annual Magazine of The Historical Society of West Wales, Volume VI, edited by Francis Green, Printed by W. Spurrell & Son, 1916) The partners were to raise the capital and share the profits in equal shares. John Jones had the right to nominate one of his sons to succeed him in the partnership if he died. If either of the other two partners died his interest in the business was to be calculated and the value paid to his executor. Any partner could terminate the partnership upon six months‚Äô notice. Bank premises and staff It is not clear if the 1806 agreement represented a variation of the earlier 1762 bank business, or the establishment of a new bank. The business was to be carried on in Aberystwyth and there was a restrictive covenant preventing them from entering into any other banking activity. There was a requirement for an annual statement of account. The bank premises, stuccoed with corniced eaves, were located at 43 Bridge Street, Aberystwyth, in a row of three-storey late Georgian houses. The building is still known as The Old Bank House.Lloyd., T., Orbach., J., Scourfield, R., 2006, Pevsner Architectural Guides, The Buildings of Wales, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, Yale University Press Under an agreement dated 1 July 1806, made between Rice Jones, from Dolgellau, and the partners in the Bank, Rice Jones became a bank clerk for three years at a salary of ¬£30 per annum. He was given meat, drink, and lodging by David Davies, and the arrangement could be terminated by either party on six months‚Äô notice. Rice Jones gave a guarantee bond for the sum of ¬£1000 to the Bank in return. Succession Between 1806 and 1808, Thomas Morgan died and the partnership admitted Thomas Williams of Aberystwyth as replacement partner. By means of an indenture dated 13 September 1808, Thomas Williams acquired a one-third share in the Bank, and otherwise on terms identical to the partnership deed of 1806. He was probably the brother of Evan Williams, with whom he was in partnership in a printing business in London, and which printed the first edition of Dr W.O. Pughe‚Äôs Welsh Dictionary.https://biography.wales/article/s-WILL-EVA-1749 The National Library of Wales, Dictionary of Welsh Biography, Retrieved 5 September 2009 Thomas Williams died on 15 April 1839, aged 53. His name appears in a list of donors, having given a donation of ¬£100 towards the work in rebuilding St. Michael‚Äôs Church (built 1829-33), Aberystwyth in 1830. Dissolution and regeneration In 1815 the partnership was dissolved and a notice of dissolution appeared in the London Gazette on 12 August 1815, which stated that all local bank notes of the Bank would be paid at the banking house at Aberystwyth, while all notes payable in London would be paid at the house of Sir James Esdaile & Co., in London. On 21 August 1816 the partners in the Bank made an assignment of their debts, probably in order to liquidate the assets of the Bank for distribution between the partners. Despite dissolution of the partnership in 1815, and payment of creditors in full, the business appeared to have been continued by Thomas Williams. In 1832, a bank was doing business in Bridge Street, Aberystwyth called Williams, Davies & Co., with London agents being Sir James Esdaile & Co. In about 1815 Williams either continued the bank or established a new one. It was known as Williams, Davies and Co. Rice Jones later became a partner with Henry Benson (a wine dealer and sometime a mayor and coroner). The North and South Wales Bank took it over on 15 August 1836 and paid Benson and Rice Jones ¬£3,000. Rice Jones became the manager at a salary of ¬£400.(Wil o‚Äô Whispers article in the Cambrian News based on records of the Midland bank)Lewis, W.J., Born on a Perilous Rock, p. 139 The North and South Wales Bank was in New Street from about 1864 - 1885, then moved to a building on the south side of Great Darkgate Street.

During World War II, he played a central role in the Church's resistance against the Nazi authorities. He was bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros from 1945 to 1960. Early life and career He was born in Decorah, Iowa in the United States as a son of vicar Karl Anton Fjellbu (1865‚Äì1933) and his wife Ellen Johanne Retvedt (1865‚Äì1941). In 1900, the family moved from the Red River Valley to Norway. He took his examen artium at Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1909. He then graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.theol. degree in 1914, completed the practical-theological seminary and was ordained in 1916. In October 1918 he married Karen Christie (1892‚Äì1965). He was a priest in Berlin from 1916 to 1917, acting vicar in Borge from 1919-1921, and auxiliary priest in the Nidaros Cathedral from 1921-1927. He was promoted to curate in 1927 and dean in 1937. Falstad in 1942 Later career In April 1940 the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started, supported by the Norwegian political party Nasjonal Samling. Fjellbu was anti- Nasjonal Samling already in 1940, but continued in his job. On 1 February 1942, however, the authorities demanded that Nazi priest P. Blessing-Dahle preside over the church ceremony to celebrate the inauguration () of the Quisling regime. Fjellbu then held an alternative ceremony later the same day, and for that he was fired on 19 February. As a result, all bishops in the Church of Norway stepped down in protest against the Nazi regime on 24 February 1942. Fjellbu had a son, also named Arne (born 1921), who was imprisoned in Falstad concentration camp from 9 March to 9 June 1942. Fjellbu attributed the cohesion of the Church of Norway in its confrontation against Nazism to the campaign led by Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group in Norway from 1934 onwards. Fjellbu was expelled from the Diocese of Nidaros on 1 May 1942, and moved to H√∏len before being expelled to And√∏ya in June 1943. He was coerced from And√∏ya to Lillehammer in the summer of 1944, but fled to Sweden the same autumn. In December 1944, Fjellbu was appointed Bishop of the liberated parts of Northern Norway by the Norwegian government-in-exile. He arrived in Kirkenes on 12 January 1945 and visited the burned-down cities of Vads√∏ and Vard√∏ as well as other settlements. He stayed in Finnmark until late March, when he was called to London to speak at a memorial sermon in Westminster Abbey on 9 April. He returned from the United Kingdom to Stockholm by plane on 1 May 1945, heading for Finnmark, but due to the events instead travelled to Trondheim by train, arriving on 9 May, and conducting a sermon in a crowded Nidaros Cathedral the following day. A day after Germany's loss in the war, Fjellbu became \\"Acting Bishop\\" of Nidaros, and in November 1945 he got the position formally. He was inaugurated on 13 January 1946. During the war years, Fjellbu documented events in a secret diary, parts of which were published as Minner fra krigs√•rene in 1945. Fjellbu remained a bishop until his retirement in 1960. He was a co-founder of the World Council of Churches in 1948, and was a member of its executive committee in 1953. He was also involved in the Lutheran World Federation. He wrote several books, and a Festschrift to him was issued on his seventieth birthday. He held honorary degrees from Lund University and the University of St Andrews, was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and an honorary member of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the International Mark Twain Society. He was appointed as a Commander With Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1958, and also as a Commander of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog. He died in October 1962 in Trondheim.

His work was awarded the Pr√™mio Jabuti three times, in 1994, 2000 and 2007. Work in Europe Born in Rio de Janeiro, Tolentino moved to Europe when he was 24 - something he later claimed to have done on the invitation of the Italian poet Giuseppe Ungaretti - at the advent of the Military Regime in Brazil. This European stay would last some thirty years. Amongst what he claimed to be his many important relationships in the European cultural scene was the English poet W. H. Auden - although Auden, in the 1960s,had long left England and was living in the USA. Tolentino was co-editor of the magazine Oxford Poetry Now, whose title was inspired by W. H. Auden's entirely distinct 1920s magazine Oxford Poetry. All four issues of Oxford Poetry Now had James Lindesay as chief-editor.Oxford OLIS catalogue Tolentino contributed to all four issues, and supported the magazine financially. By his own account, while in England, Bruno Tolentino lectured in literature at the universities of Bristol, Essex and Oxford, until his conviction for drug smuggling in 1987. He was sentenced to eleven years in prison, but, in the event, served only thirteen months, which he spent at Dartmoor. During this time he organized language and literature classes for the prisoners entitled \\"Seminars of Drama and Literature\\". While in Europe, he published two books: Le Vrai Le Vain in 1971 and About the Hunt in 1978. Though published in France by La Part du Feu, an offprint of the magazine Actuels, Le Vrai Le Vain is absent from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France integrated catalogue (as of 30 June 2010) and perhaps the only library catalogue in which it appears is that of the Albert Sloman Library of the University of Essex.University of Essex library This is a bilingual volume with Portuguese on the left-hand page and French on the right-hand page. Similarly, although published in England, About the Hunt failed to receive a copyright and the work is absent from the British Library integrated catalogue as of June 17. 2010, although it is present in the Oxford OLIS online catalogue.Oxford OLIS catalogue According to Tolentino's later accounts, both books were acclaimed by European critics, including Ungaretti and Auden, as well as Yves Bonnefoy, Saint-John Perse and Jean Starobinski.globo.com Controversies Tolentino was an expert at self- mythologizing. Late in life multiple stories (of uncertain origin) about his life abounded, as claims that he had married Bertrand Russell's daughter, as well as Ren√© Char's and Rainer Maria Rilke's granddaughters, as well as about his being acquainted during his childhood with the most pre-eminent contemporary Brazilian men of letters in his family's salon. According to an obituary written by literary scholar Chris Miller, Tolentino was a character \\"stranger than fiction\\", and his claims about literary friendships were at least partially true (e.g. his friendship to Yves Bonnefroy); however, according to the same scholar, Tolentino's exaggerations made it very difficult to tell truth from fiction.Chris Miller, \\"Bruno Tolentino\\", PN Review 180, Volume 34 Number 4, March - April 2008, available on line at In an scathing account published in a history of Brazilian literature in the year of Tolentino's death, his fellow-poet Alexei Bueno charged Tolentino with having faked his entire biography from the earliest date, beginning with \\"his manor house and his English private female tutors\\": according to Bueno, Tolentino had been born \\"amid the most banal middle-class milieu from the neighbourhood of Tijuca, as the child of a military man, and had spent his teens in small apartments in the same neighbourhood and in Niter√≥i\\". According also to Bueno, during 1957, when still in Brazil, Tolentino had been involved in a case of plagiarism, having published a book of poetry whose title and poems were taken from others. His later self-attributed resounding intellectual feats abroad, as well as his alleged connections with European literary figures, were, according to the same Bueno, simply a hoax, as \\"in order to have lived all happenings he publicly boasted of, [Tolentino] should have lived nearly three hundred years\\". Bueno, however, eventually downplayed what he saw as his mythomania by comparing him to the eminent filmmaker M√°rio Peixoto - who had put in circulation a bogus complimentary article on his work by Eisenstein - as well as acknowledging Tolentino's talent as a satirical poet.Alexei Bueno, \\"Uma hist√≥ria da poesia brasileira \\". G. Ermakoff Casa Editorial: 2007, pages 390 sqq. Others critics have expressed similar doubts about the reality of Tolentino's biographical claims,Wilson Martins, \\"Versos anacr√¥nicos da milit√¢ncia tardia\\", O Globo , n.d.g. such as being advised to write in English by Samuel Beckett, given the quality of his writing in Portuguese.Correio Braziliense , 18 January 2003 Some, such as the poet and critic Ivan Junqueira, do not consider the issues mentioned above as real cases of plagiarism and hoaxing in Tolentino's career, highlighting instead his mastery of the art of pastiching the classics.Ivan Junqueira, O Fio de D√©dalo: ensaios, Rio de Janeiro: Record, 1998, , page 91 Return to Brazil After returning to Brazil in 1993, Tolentino published a series of books, collecting material produced over many years, which he considered to be the culmination of his poetic work. They are As Horas de Katharina (1971‚Äì1993), whose subject matter was loosely inspired on the life and message of Anne Catherine Emmerich, O Mundo Como Id√©ia (1959‚Äì1999), and A Imita√ß√£o do Amanhecer (1979‚Äì2004), all winners of the Jabuti Prize for Brazilian literature. O Mundo Como Id√©ia is regarded as his most important literary work, developing the core of his ideas about literature. This work also won him the Senador Jos√© Erm√≠nio de Moraes Prize, the first occasion on which this prize was awarded to a poet. In his late phase, Tolentino adopted an activist stance in defense of traditional meters and subjects, and it was as such that he clashed with the concrete poet Augusto de Campos. In an article published in the 3 September 1994 issue of Folha de S.Paulo, he criticised what he considered to be Campos' poor translation of the poem Praise for an Urn by Hart Crane, describing Campos as \\"prepotent and vain\\", \\"a delirious authoritarian\\", and a \\"vetuste poetic inspector\\". Campos issued a rejoinder published in O Estado de S. Paulo, describing Tolentino as an \\"upstart\\", and his alternative translation of Crane's poem as \\"limping on every feet and stuffed with poor rhyming, flaccid and adipose\\".John Milton, \\"Augusto de Campos e Bruno Tolentino: a Guerra das Tradu√ß√µes\\" This opinion was shared by Alexei Bueno, who, although just as opposed to non-traditional poetic forms as Tolentino, nevertheless considered that :\\"All of Tolentino's poetry is [...] ruled by an addiction to enjambement, therefore he has written poems almost wholly without end-stopping. This kind of enjambement-powered barrel-organ, monotone to the extreme, cuts through all of his work [...] Occasionally, amid this boring and obsessive graphomany - a kind of funfair music - there are some great lyrical moments, which, however, are not enough to rescue the general emptiness of the whole.\\". Nevertheless, Tolentino continued in his activism in defence of what he saw as high culture. Shortly after the quarrel with Augusto de Campos, in an interview to Veja magazine, he criticised Campos' friend, the composer Caetano Veloso, considering the teaching of his work in schools as a sign of the destruction of Brazilian culture. Tolentino's last works include A Balada do C√°rcere, published in 1996, a literary account of his experiences in Dartmoor prison.;\\"A balada do carcere\\" (Rio de Janeiro, 1996: Topbooks), 36. the preceding year, he had published Os Deuses de Hoje, inspired by an experience in prison during the military dictatorship, although it is widely agreed that he left Brazil in or before 1964. Late in his life, he also came to be regarded as a cult figure by a circle of right wing admirers,As, for instance, the group of conservative Catholics gathered around the magazine Dicta & Contradicta: cf. Gabriel Periss√©, \\"Dicta & Contradicta: uma revista que se acha\\". Observat√≥rio da Imprensa newssite, issue 491, 24 June 2008, available at mostly for his pass√©ist stance in both poetry and politics, expressed in a rejection of the present for the sake of an ultramontane Catholicism.Maria Isabel Mendes de Almeida & Santuza Cambraia Naves, orgs. \\"Por que n√£o?\\": rupturas e continuidades da contracultura.Rio de Janeiro: 7 Letras, 2007, , page 51 In his last years, Tolentino developed closer ties with conservative Catholicism through the Opus Dei, giving at least one lecture, in 2006, at one of the cultural centers kept by the prelature in Brazil.\\"La vida es metaf√≠sica\\".

Siliciano (sill-ih-CAH-noh) has a joint appointment in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins. Siliciano researches the mechanisms by which the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains latent in the human body.HHMI investigator pageJohns Hopkins faculty page Training and career Siliciano had a childhood interest in chemistry fostered by his mother Ann, a professor of physiology at Elmira College, and studied chemistry as an undergraduate at Princeton University. He then studied medicine and immunology at Johns Hopkins, earning both MD and PhD degrees. Siliciano continued his training in immunology with Ellis Reinherz at Harvard University, investigating the response of CD4-positive T-cells to antigens. Siliciano is a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. Research The problem of HIV latency is a focus of Siliciano's research. When HIV integrates into the genome of a host cell but remains transcriptionally silent in a state known as \\"latency,\\" the immune system is unable to detect and destroy the infected cell and its virus. Antiretroviral drugs are highly effective at controlling virus replication, but they also have several drawbacks. Some people experience side effects when taking these medications, and if treatment is interrupted, latent HIV can begin replicating and spreading again, often developing resistance to anti-HIV medications in the process. HIV/AIDS researchers including Siliciano have hypothesized that if all latent virus in the body could be simultaneously forced out of latency, or \\"reactivated,\\" antiretroviral drugs could prevent the newly formed viruses from successfully infecting new cells, thus eradicating HIV from an infected person. Several candidate drugs have been proposed, but they cause unacceptable toxicity by globally activating the patient's uninfected T cells. In 2009, Siliciano and his laboratory published a study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation and described the in vitro use of a latency-reversing drug called 5HN (5-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione). 5HN brings integrated HIV-1 out of latency but does not activate all T cells and may not be as toxic as other proposed latency-reversing compounds. Interviewed by Bloomberg.com, Siliciano commented, \\"This is a way in which you could envision finding a drug that would, in conjunction with existing treatment, allow us to cure patients.\\"\\"AIDS Study Flushes Out Hidden Virus, Pointing to Possible Cure\\" Simeon Bennet, Bloomberg.

It is the most recent incarnation of the South Bend Railway Company, a street railway company that was founded on May 25, 1885. Overview TRANSPO is a hub-and-spoke system, with routes radiating from the center towards the outward corners of the metropolitan area. It is made up of 18 fixed bus routes. It also operates an on-demand paratransit service. In Mishawaka, it serves as a de facto school bus service. South Street Station serves as a system hub, linking together most of the routes. The system runs Monday-Saturday, operating 5:50 AM ‚Äì 10:00 PM on weekdays and 6:00 AM ‚Äì 6:45 PM on Saturdays. It does not operate on Sundays or major holidays. All buses are equipped with bike racks. In 2014, Transpo began converting the aging fleet to compressed natural gas (CNG) with the arrival of 14 New Flyer buses.  Fares  The fares have been increased several times during the system's history. The most recent increase was on April 5, 2010. The fares are now the following: * Base Fare: $1.00 * Reduced Fare: $0.50 * Day Pass: $3.00 * 2 Week Pass: $18.00 * Adult 31 Day Pass $35.00 * Student 31 Day Pass: $30.00 * Access Fare: $2.00 * Access Two Ride Card: $4.00 * Access Ten Ride Card: $20.00 University of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's College students, faculty and staff can ride for free provided they show a valid ID.

The airport doubles as a regional transit hub. Coach USA buses stop there (and formerly, so did Greyhound Lines buses), and the airport terminal building incorporates the eponymous South Shore Line station The South Shore Line links South Bend to the city of Chicago, making stops at cities, villages and other miscellaneous municipalities throughout Northern Indiana. Route 2 stops at the city's Amtrak station. Route 5 connects to Niles DART Route 2 at Auten Rd/933 stop Monday-Friday. Route 9 links up with the Interurban Trolley system's Bittersweet/Mishawaka Route at Twin Branch Park. The route links Mishawaka to Downtown Elkhart. Hubs South Street Station South Street Station in 2006 South Street Station is the primary hub of the system. It is located in Downtown South Bend. Efforts planning this station date back to 1992. It was envisioned to be an intermodal transit hub, which would feature a new station for Amtrak (replacing South Bend's existing Amtrak station) as well as a transit center for South Bend TRANSPO. South Street Station was opened in 1998. It was solely a bus center for South Bend TRANSPO, with the Amtrak component planned to be built at a later date. Ultimately, the Amtrak component failed to materialize. On December 2, 2019, Greyhound Lines moved its intercity bus service from South Bend International Airport to the South Street Station. There have been talks of constructing a downtown South Shore Line station for South Bend, replacing the existing station at South Bend International Airport. Such a station, if constructed, might be either adjacent to, or integrated into, the South Street Station. A decision regarding the future of South Bend's South Shore Line station is anticipated to be made at some point in 2020. Mishawaka Transfer Center The system's second hub is the Mishawaka Transfer Center, located in Downtown Mishawaka. The station is also served by the Interurban Trolley.

They are moderately sized snakes that can grow to a length of in length. Their coloration and markings can vary considerably. They prey primarily on small rodents. They possess medically significant venom, although the mortality rate for untreated bites on humans is relatively low (~5‚Äì10%, in endemic regions under 1%). Like other spitting cobras, they can eject venom from their fangs when threatened (one drop over and more in perfect accuracy). The neurotoxic venom irritates the skin, causing blisters and inflammation, and can cause permanent blindness if the venom makes contact with the eyes and is not washed off. Naja nigricollis belongs to the cobra genus Naja under the family Elapidae. It previously included two subspecies that have been moved to the species Naja nigricincta - the zebra spitting cobra (Naja nigricincta nigricincta) and the black spitting cobra (Naja nigricincta woodi). Taxonomy Naja nigricollis is classified under the genus Naja of the family Elapidae. It was first described by Norwegian zoologist Johan Reinhardt in 1843. The generic name Naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word ' (), meaning \\"cobra\\". The specific epithet nigricollis is Latin for \\"black-necked\\": niger, meaning \\"black\\", and collis, meaning \\"neck\\". Naja nigricollis previously included two subspecies - Naja nigricollis nigricincta and Naja nigricollis woodi. But genetic studies in 2007 by Wolfgang W√ºster etal. have concluded that these subspecies should be treated under a separate species, Naja nigricincta.W√ºster, W., S. Crookes, I. Ineich, Y. Mane, C.E. Pook, J.-F. Trape & D.G. Broadley (2007) \\"The phylogeny of cobras inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences: evolution of venom spitting and the phylogeography of the African spitting cobras (Serpentes: Elapidae: Naja nigricollis complex)\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 45: 437‚Äì453. Description N. nigricollis is a moderately sized, venomous snake with a moderately distinct head; the shape of the head is due primarily to two large venom glands found on each side of the head. Its colour can vary depending on region of origin. Some specimens are black or pale grey with a yellow or reddish ventral side with a broad, black neck band, often with an orange or pinkish bar on the neck. Other specimens can be yellowish-brown or have a yellow copper colour and are missing the bandings around the neck and the reddish colour on the belly. Some other specimens are deep reddish-brown, and yet others are an olive brown. Some can even be striped black and white or totally white (with dark eyes). There are 21‚Äì23 dorsal scales at the mid-body, 182‚Äì196 ventral scales, and 54‚Äì66 subcaudal scales. This species generally grows to a length of to . These sizes are subject to trends based on geographic location and subspecies. Distribution and habitat The species is very common and is widespread through much of sub-Saharan Africa and is found in western, eastern, central, and parts of southern Africa. It is absent from the rainforests of the Congo Basin. It has been recorded from Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (except in the center), Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Sudan, Tanzania, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia. Older records from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, or most of Namibia refer to Naja mossambica or Naja nigricincta, which were formerly regarded as subspecies of N.nigricollis. N. nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and semi-desert regions of Africa. However, they can be found at altitudes up to , as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist savanna and cleared former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. Adaptable snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats. The range of Naja nigricollis is currently expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria to the more desert and arid conditions in the central part of the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. Because they are so common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people. Behavior Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can be either nocturnal or diurnal depending on the time of year, geographic location, and average daytime temperature. This adaptability allows the snake to better regulate its body temperature and to gain access to the most abundant food sources of a particular area. It feeds primarily on small rodents, such as small rats and mice, birds, and fishes, but will also eat lizards, eggs, and other snakes. Like other snakes, it may fall prey to raptors, especially different species of snake eagles that migrate to Africa when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) may be a particular threat, as it is almost strictly an ophiophagus raptor. Other snakes also prey on this species. Like other spitting cobras, this species is known for its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis is known for its tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation. This species is sometimes found in captivity, and wild-caught individuals are generally nervous and prone to spitting. Captive-bred animals tend to be much more docile and calm when compared to their wild-caught counterparts. Reproduction Like other cobra species, this snake is oviparous. The mating season of this species can vary from the end of winter (September) to the beginning of summer (December). Usually, the mating season is the same whether in captivity or in the wild. Females will commonly lay 10 to 15 eggs but can lay anywhere between eight and 22 eggs at a time. The gestation period lasts about 90‚Äì100 days, but once the eggs are laid, they hatch in 60‚Äì70 days, and need to be in a temperature of . At birth, the young are about in length and are completely independent. Venom The venom of Naja nigricollis is somewhat unusual among elapids in that it consists primarily of cytotoxins, but with other components also. It retains the typical elapid neurotoxic properties while combining these with highly potent cytotoxins (necrotic agents) and cardiotoxins. Bite symptoms include severe external hemorrhaging and tissue necrosis around the bite area and difficulty breathing. Although the mortality rate in untreated cases is low (~5‚Äì10%), when death occurs, it is usually due to asphyxiation by paralysis of the diaphragm. The of Naja nigricollis is 2 mg/kg SC and 1.15 mg/kg IV. The average venom yield per bite of this species is 200 to 350 mg (dry weight) according to Minton (1974). Snake venom ophthalmia In 1944, writing as Major Harold Ridley, the English ophthalmic surgeon published a short paper in the British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and an account of the composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year- old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.

Charles D. Cobb, USNR, in command.  Service History (Turner) During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the USS LSM(R)-189 but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. Embarked were the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions under Major General Roy S. Geiger. The LSMs involved, as part of the Northern Tractor Flotilla were LSMs 84, 162, 166, 175, 220, 228, 246, 265, 270, 271, 274, 277, 278, 325, and 326. The northern support craft included USS LSM(R)-194, USS LSM(R)-195, USS LSM(R)-196, USS LSM(R)-197, USS LSM(R)-198, and LSM(R)-199. On 13 April 1945 LSM(R)'S 192, 193, 196, 197, 198 199 and LC(FF) 535 were assigned to night harassment and destructive bombardment of Ie Shima. These LSM(R)'S utilized irregular rocket fire for destructive harassment 5\\" star shell for illumination and harassment, and 40 mm to prevent reinforcement of the beach defenses. The night patrols of the surrounding waters prevented any movement or mine laying. On morning of 16 April, these LSM(R)'s were used for rocket attack in support of assault troops. Approximately 2600 rockets were fired into a large area composed principally of the South Eastern sector of the town of le and the Eastern and South Eastern vicinities of Ie-gushuyama. Okinawa Radar Picket Line (C.T.G. 52.21) The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 - 20 April, Action Report indicated that . . .\\"these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously effect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations.\\" Before these recommendations were implemented the USS LSMR-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, the USS LSMR-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, the USS LSMR-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded.

Plot Set in Britain during World War Two, the story revolves around a girl, Carrie Willow, approximately ten years of age, and her slightly younger brother, Nick, who are sent to live in a rundown village in Wales from London during the Battle of Britain. They stay with a rural shopkeeper, Mr Samuel Evans, a harsh taskmaster, and his timid sister, Auntie Lou, whom Samuel dominates and bullies. Another evacuee child, Albert, lives at a nearby country mansion called Druid's Bottom, run by the oldest Evans sister, Mrs. Dilys Gotobed, estranged from Mr Evans, penniless and terminally ill, along with her mentally disabled adult cousin Mr Johnny and housekeeper, Hepzibah Green. All the inhabitants of Druid's Bottom befriend Carrie and Nick. Unlike an earlier British TV series, Tom Grattan's War, which also featured a child war evacuee, Carrie and her brother do not have any adventures with German spies or deserters, and there is no violence. Instead Carrie's War is a quiet, intimate story about the relationships between the characters and how they change over time. There is a vaguely supernatural theme as well, as Hepzibah is reputed to be wise woman and there is rumored to be a curse on Druid's Bottom. During the course of the series Auntie Lou weds an American soldier and leaves the village over Mr Evans's bitter objections. Mrs Gotobed dies and Mr Evans tries to claim her mansion and property and to evict Hepzibah and Mr Johnny after her will apparently disappears. Carrie and Nick are convinced that Mr Evans has stolen the will, and she retaliates by stealing an old skull which is believed to control a curse on Druid's Bottom, which then burns down, causing guilt to Carrie who has by then discovered that Mr Evans was in fact innocent - there was no will at all. The Willow children go to live with family in Glasgow. There is an epilogue in which, thirty years later, the adult Carrie returns to the area with her (two) children to discover that Hepzibah and Mr Johnny are still living at Druid's Bottom, now owned by Albert Sandwich, while Mr Evans has died years before, alone and unhappy. Production Shot by the BBC, the show was principally filmed on location in Blaengarw in rural Wales. Only a small amount of Welsh was spoken in the series: by Mr Evans saying Grace at the children's first meal in his house in Episode 1, and by the minister, Mr Morgan, officiating at Mrs Gotobed's funeral (\\"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust...\\") in Episode 4. The railway scenes in Episodes 1 and 5 were filmed on the Severn Valley Railway.Severn Valley Railway News, Issue 31, Spring 1974, pp. 1,15. There were five half-hour episodes which were aired in January 1974. The cast of child actors would have few other credits.

I Gede Ekaputra Gunartha, History The process of the establishment of the University of Mataram begins with the establishment of the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of the State University of Mataram-based PTIP Decree number 89/62 dated June 26, 1962. The committee is chaired by the Governor of the Province of NTB, namely R. Ar. Moh. Ruslan tjakraningrat. Preparatory committee was then formed the Preparatory Committee, which consists of two parts, namely Core Part (governor, commander, Chief Constable, and Head of Branch Attorney) and Section Organizers (Section Lessons chaired by Drs. Soeroso, MA and Section Material chaired by Sadili Sastrawidjaja, SH). The Preparatory Committee produced two basic proposals, namely: a) Establishment of the Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Animal Science and the Faculty of yangmenghasilkan agronomist; b) Alternative name University: Sangkareang or MATARAM. Based on the proposal forwarded by the Preparatory Committee of the Preparatory Committee, stipulated the establishment of the State University based in Mataram with PTIP Decree No. 139/62 dated November 3, 1962. Until one year after the publication of the decree, there is no activity that marked the functioning of the university that upon request Governor, on November 17, 1963 Sangkareang Education Foundation opened Faculty of Economics which is expected to be one of the faculty at the State University in Mataram. Preparatory Committee disbanded dated December 7, 1963 as its work otherwise been completed. On December 19, 1963 Sangkareang Education Foundation handed Faculty of Economics, the following 41 students to the Governor for further unveiled by PTIP. At that time the State University of Mataram officially started its activities. On this basis Mataram University commemorating the anniversary on December 19. But after a series of processes is observed re-establishment, that determined later Anniversary celebrated on every October 1. In 1967, the University of Mataram opened three faculties at the same time, the Faculty of Agriculture (1967), Faculty of Animal Husbandry (1967) and the Faculty of Law (1967). At that time the University of Mataram was still a Presidiumschop. Based on the decision of the University Senate Meeting Mataram March 8, 1968, presidiumschop converted into rectorschop. The Senate decision was strengthened by the Decree of the Director General of Higher Education number 156 / KT / I / SP / 68 which set a start date of March 1, 1968 presidiumschop University of Mataram be rectorschop. During its development, until the academic year of 2011/2012 the University of Mataram had 9 faculties. Five faculty that were formed after the Law Faculty are the Faculty of Education (Teacher Trainning & Science Education), established by Decree Rector of the University of Mataram number 102 / PT.21 / H4 / 1981 dated 25 April 1981. Then the Faculty of Engineering, the faculty was established based on changes in the status of the College Engineering Mataram (STTM) into a Civil Engineering Program corresponding Decree of the Director General of Higher Education number 68 / Dikti / Kep / 1991 dated November 8, 1991. Based on the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture number 0375 / o / 1993 dated October 21, 1993 was officially established Faculty of Engineering at the University of Mataram. The last three faculty are the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine, each based on the Decree of the Rector of the University of Mataram No. 10146 / H18 / 2007 dated August 25, 2007 and the Decree of the Rector of the University of Mataram No. 10147 / H18 / 2007 dated August 25, 2007, as well as the Faculty of Food Technology and Agro-industry with Mataram University Rector Decree No. 1569 / UN18 / HK.00.01 / 2012 dated 4 February 2012. Postgraduate Program was established by the Decree of the Rector of the University of Mataram No. 8251 / J18.H / HK.01.11 / 2005 dated 8 September 2005 which manages the Master and Doctoral Program.

The lens board itself is usually flat, square, and made of metal (most commonly aluminum), wood, or plastic. The lens board will have a hole of various diameters drilled dead center on the board. A lens board typically varies between 1 and 4 millimeters in thickness. The overall size and shape of the lens board depends on the brand of camera and film format used. Some cameras will use 2 to 4 screws to secure the lens board to the front standard of the view camera, most commonly however, the lens board will be secured by one or more locking levers or tabs to allow tool-less removal of the lens board. The rear surface of a lens board is usually painted matte black to keep light entering the camera through the lens during exposure from reflecting off the surface and interfering with the projected image. While most lens boards are flat, some are recessed to accommodate wider focal length lenses which must be positioned closer to the film plane. A recessed lens board effectively reduces the flange focal distance of a camera. Sizes Depending on the size and focal length of a particular lens, a certain diameter of hole must be drilled in the center of the lens board to accommodate the shutter assembly . Lens boards are typically available pre-drilled by the camera manufacturer, however, if no replacement lens board is available from a camera manufacturer, then one must be custom fabricated by a machinist. Nowadays, nearly all large format leaf shutters are manufactured by the Nidec Copal Corporation, therefore the diameter of hole drilled is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄòCopal Number‚Äô. The Copal sizes are as follows: *Copal #0 - 34.6 mm *Copal #1 - 41.6 mm *Copal #3 ‚Äì 65 mm *Copal #3s - 64.5 mm The origin Compur/Compound sizes are as follows: *Compur #00 - 26.3 mm *Compur #0 - 34.6 mm *Compur #1 - 41.6 mm *Compur #2 - 52.5 mm (there were different versions like Compur II and Compur II 5/2) *Compur #3 - 65.0 mm *Compound Dagor - 38.0 mm *Compound #3 H√ºlse 7 - 63.2 mm *Compound #4 H√ºlse 9 - 69.1 mm *Compound #4 H√ºlse 10 - 80.0 mm *Compound #5 H√ºlse 12 - 93.4 mm Lens mounting 135mm Optar lens mounted on a #0 Speed Graphic lens board Lenses are fitted to a lens board by placing the shutter assembly through the front of the board and securing the shutter assembly by threading a locknut to rear of the shutter. A front lens element will thread onto the mounted shutter and if necessary, a second lens element will thread onto the rear of the mounted shutter. This procedure can be accomplished by a camera technician, or by an end-user with the appropriate tools. Other uses Enlarging lens mounted on a Besseler 45M enlarger Lens boards are used in photographic enlargers to secure an enlarging lens to the focus stage of the device. Similar to large format photographic view cameras, a lens board is utilized by some reprographic cameras in the printing industry. Lens boards may also be utilized by some medical and scientific imaging devices.

An admission fee is charged. The garden was created between 1961-1977 to replace the Alter Botanischer Garten Marburg, dating from 1810. Its construction involved movement of some 80,000 m¬≥ of earth, creating a pond and a brook about 1 km long, as well as a major effort to build greenhouses. The garden was inaugurated in June 1977 to celebrate the university's 450th anniversary. Outdoor areas of the garden are organized as follows: * Alpinum - rock garden representing plants from the high mountains of Europe, western Asia, the Himalayas, Australia, and New Zealand. * Arboretum - focusing on conifers, including Sequoiadendron giganteum and Metasequoia glyptostroboides, as well as alders, ash, birches, ginkgos, hazels, maples, oaks, deciduous poplars, sycamores, and willows, representing both native and exotic species. * Burial mounds - Bronze Age graves. * Fern collection - 80 fern species. * Forest - spring-blooming plants including Anemone, Gagea, Iris, Narcissus, Pulsatilla, Scilla, and Tulipa. * Heather and rhododendron garden - numerous heather and rhododendron species including Calluna vulgaris, Erica carnea, Erica cinerea, and Erica tetralix. * Medicinal and useful plants - including cereals and other carbohydrates, succulents, vegetables, fiber plants, tobacco plants, rubber plants, and dye plants. * Systematic garden - representatives of seed plant families organized by biological classification In addition, the garden's greenhouses cover total area of 1,700 square meters as follows: tropical house (545 m¬≤, 12 m height); Canary Islands house (182 m¬≤ + 82 m¬≤, 7 m); tropical crop house (182 m¬≤, 7 m) with plants including Ananas comosus and Coffea arabica; Amazon house (123 m¬≤, 6 m) containing aquatic plants of the Amazon region including Bruguiera sexangula and Victoria amazonica; tropical fern house (182 m¬≤, 7 m); succulent house (227 m¬≤, 7 m); Australian outback house (182 m¬≤, 7 m); and carnivorous plant house (not open to the public).

The linking group R between the functional groups consists of a 1,4-substituted aryl group.. Properties PAEK has a continuous operating temperature of and under short-term loads can function up to . When burned it has the least toxic and corrosive fumes. It also has a low heat output when burned, so it qualifies for use in interior aviation applications. It also has good overall chemical resistance.. It has a tensile strength of and a Young's modulus of . Its yield strength is at and at . It does not break in an un-notched Izod impact test.. Chemistry PAEK plastics are characterized by phenylene rings that are linked via oxygen bridges (ether and carbonyl groups (ketone)). The ratio and sequence of ether to ketones mainly affects the glass transition temperature and melting point of the polymer. It also affects its heat resistance and processing temperature. The higher the ratio of ketones the more rigid the polymer chain, which results in a higher glass transition temperature and melting point. The processing temperatures can range from 350 to 430 ¬∞C.. Plastics that fall within this family include: *PEK *PEEK *PEKK *PEEKK *PEKEKK (polyetherketoneetherketoneketone) Production PAEKs can be produced in two ways, one is called the nucleophilic route and the other is called the electrophilic route. The nucleophilic route has the formation of ether linkages in the polymerization step. The electrophilic route has the formation of carbonyl bridges during the polymerization step. It can be processed using all of the typical thermoplastic processes, such as injection molding, extrusion, compression molding, and transfer molding. Applications One major engineering application is oil drilling components, such as seals, compressor rings, valve parts, gears, bearings, and wire coatings. It is also used in the chemical pump industry because it can withstand the temperature, stress, and has the corrosion resistance. In the automotive industry it is used to make gears and thrust bearings in transmissions. Due to its excellent resistance to hydrolysis it is used in medical devices because it does not break down when sterilized. PEKEKK is used to make surgical implants, such as artificial hips..

The Dirty War, a civic-military dictatorship comprising state- sponsored violence against Argentine citizenry from roughly 1976 to 1983, carried out primarily by Jorge Rafael Videla's military government. However, the human rights situation in Argentina has improved since. History According to the Nunca M√°s report issued by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) in 1984, about 9,000 people had \\"disappeared\\" between 1976 and 1983. According to a secret cable from DINA (Chilean secret police) in Buenos Aires, an estimate by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978, which started counting victims in 1975, gave the figure of 22,000 persons. This estimate was first published by John Dinges in 2004.Mid-July 1978 - (Argentine Military Intelligence Estimates 22,000 people Dead or Disappeared, page A-8), National Security Archive Estimates by human rights organizations were up to 30,000. The Montoneros admitted losing 5,000 guerrillas killed, El ex l√≠der de los Montoneros entona un ¬´mea culpa¬ª parcial de su pasado, El Mundo, May 4, 1995 and the ERP admitted the loss of another 5,000 of their own guerrillas killed. By comparison, Argentine security forces cite 775 deaths of their own. In contrast, there were 13,500 victims of left-wing terrorism in Argentina. There is no agreement on the actual number of detenidos-desaparecidos. In an interview with Buenos Aires daily Clarin in 2009, Fernandez Meijide, who formed part of the 1984 truth commission, claimed that the documented number of Argentines killed or disappeared was closer to 9,000.Argentines Argue Over How Many Were Killed by Junta The Asemblea por los Derechos Humanos (APDH or Permanent Assembly for Human Rights) estimated the number of disappeared as 12,261, which included \\"definitive disappearances\\" and PEN detainee survivors of the clandestine detention centres spread throughout Argentina. The total figure of official prisoners was 8,625 and of these PEN detainees 157 were killed after being released from detention. Between 1969 and 1979 left-wing guerrillas accounted for 3,249 kidnappings and murders. CONADEP also recorded 458 assassinations (attributed to the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance) and about 600 forced disappearances during the period of democratic rule between 1973 and 1976.Argenpress, 10 April 2006.

The principle used by the sentence was ratified by the European Court of Human Rights in the case Petr Kislyiy against Estonia on January 17, 2006 and Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling in the Case of Almonacid on September 26, 2006. The fact that these statements recognize the application of this concept of international law in ordinary courts is a milestone in the history of international human rights. This situation led to the opening of some trials in Cordoba, Corrientes, Tucum√°n and Buenos Aires and there are several on the procedural schedule. Sentences confirmed the implementation of the concept of \\"crimes against humanity\\", but investigations were not adequate to international law, or have joined the investigation and prosecution procedures as consistent with the types of crimes arising from international criminal law. This affects, using ordinary criminal law standards, the type of testing needed and who may be charged. There procedural certainty is impossible to substantiate the thousands of lawsuits pending across the country and to keep the current procedure.  Respect for the integrity of the person  Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life While the government or its agents did not commit any politically motivated killings, there are reports that police committed killings involving unwarranted or excessive force. Generally, officers accused of wrongdoing are administratively suspended until completion of an investigation. Authorities investigated and in some cases detained, prosecuted, and convicted the officers involved. The non-governmental organization (NGO) Coordinator Against Police Repression (CORREPI) reported that security forces using excessive force killed more than 200 persons each year. In January 2008 local victim advocacy organization Madres del Dolor lodged with court a case accusing two policemen of killing 21-year-old Sergio Enciso in Buenos Aires Province. The case remained pending till the end of 2008. According to Madres del Dolor, a judge detained five police officers and the police chief of Ramos Mejia in Buenos Aires Province for the February death of 35-year-old Gaston Duffau after an official autopsy confirmed that the victim died from multiple blows to the body and asphyxia. The police officials involved remained in pretrial detention at year's end. There are no known developments in the case of Carlos Madrid, an off duty Buenos Aires police sergeant, who was in pretrial detention for the November 2007 killing of Daniel Ezequiel Cespedes. In July 2008 a court sentenced police officer Dario Poblete to life imprisonment for the April 2007 killing of school teacher Carlos Fuentealba during a teachers' strike in Neuquen. In September a Jujuy provincial court sentenced one police officer to life imprisonment and another to four years in prison for the 2006 death of Saul Mendoza. The court acquitted a third officer and continued to investigate a fourth. There were no known developments in the trial of two former police officers and a civilian charged with homicide in the 2006 beating and shooting death of 15-year-old Miguel Eduardo Cardozo. Human rights groups stated to the press that ex-police officer Marta Jorgelina Oviedo was serving her life imprisonment sentence for the 2002 killing of Andrea Viera under house arrest. In August 2008 the government, as recommended by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2003, reopened an investigation into the 1991 killing by police forces of Walter Bulacio. The trial remained pending at year's end.Report on Human Rights Practices 2008: Argentina. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.  Disappearance In contrast with the systematic forced disappearance of persons under the military dictatorship, the situation has greatly improved and there were no reports of politically motivated disappearances in 2008. Judicial proceedings related to killings, disappearances, and torture committed by the 1976-83 military dictatorship continue to this day. According to a human rights organization, the (CELS), by the end of 2008, there were 255 ongoing judicial investigations and an estimated 508 persons indicted for crimes against humanity committed during the Dirty War era. Of those indicted, 358 remained in pretrial detention. At least 14 former state security agents and their civilian allies were convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances and kidnappings. A November 2008 Noticias Argentinas press report, compiling information provided by the National Prosecutor General's Office, stated that 32 individuals had been convicted for crimes against humanity since 2003, 371 suspects remained in pretrial detention, and 61 persons remained fugitives from justice. In March 2008 a federal court decided that crimes committed by the Argentine Anti Communism Alliance before and during the military dictatorship were crimes against humanity and therefore not subject to the statute of limitations. The press, civil society, and legal scholars express concern that the government's efforts to pursue justice for human rights crimes committed during the military dictatorship does not include armed guerrilla groups that also were accused of committing abuses during the same time period. In January 2008 a court released the wife and two children of former naval official Hector Febres, who died of cyanide poisoning in prison while facing charges of torture. They still faced charges on suspicion that they helped Febres commit suicide. In March a federal court released two Coast Guard constables who were arrested in connection with the case. In March 2008 the National Human Rights Secretariat pressed homicide charges against former economy minister Jose Martinez de Hoz, who served under the military dictatorship, for the death of economist Juan Carlos Casariego Del Bel. In March 2008 former navy lieutenant commander Ricardo Cavallo was extradited from Spain to Argentina to face charges of crimes against humanity committed during the military dictatorship. Cavallo was indicted in July and remained in pretrial detention at year's end. In May 2008 federal authorities indicted Ernesto Barreiro for his role in committing human rights abuses during the military dictatorship, when he served as an army officer and chief interrogator at the La Perla clandestine torture center. He remained in pretrial detention at year's end. In April 2008 former police officers Fernando Esvedes and Carlos Vercellone were arrested for their alleged role in political kidnappings and torture in the clandestine detention center Pozo de Arana during the military dictatorship, and their trial remained pending at year's end. In July former army chief Luciano Benjamin Menendez and former army officials Oreste Valentin Padovan, Ricardo Alberto Ramon Lardone, Carlos Alberto Diaz, and Luis Alberto Manzanelli were sentenced to life imprisonment for human rights violations committed during the military dictatorship. Former army officials Hermes Oscar Rodriguez, Jorge Exequiel Acosta, and Carlos Alberto Vega received sentences ranging from 18 to 22 years' imprisonment. In August 2008 former army lieutenant colonel Julio Rafael Barreiro was sentenced to life imprisonment, while former captain Juan Carlos de Marchi and former colonel Horacio Losito were sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for their role in human rights violations during the military dictatorship. Former gendarmerie commander Raul Alfredo Reynoso was sentenced to 18 years. In August 2008 a human rights trial against former brigadier general Enrique Braulio Olea, former colonels Oscar Lorenzo Reinhold and Mario Alberto Gomez Arenas, former major Luis Alberto Farias Barrera, former military officers Jorge Eduardo Molina Ezcurra and Sergio Adolfo San Martin, and doctor Hilarion de la Paz Sosa began in Neuquen Province. The former military officials were accused of 17 counts of crimes against humanity committed during the military dictatorship. In September 2008 a federal judge resumed an investigation into the 1973 killing of General Labor Confederation leader Jose Ignacio Rucci, in which the armed guerrilla group, the Montoneros, was believed to have been involved. In October 2008 federal authorities indicted former National University Concentration chief Eduardo Cincotta, former member Nicolas Cafarello, three former air force officials, and former army colonel Roberto Atilio Bocalandro for human rights crimes committed in the clandestine detention center La Cueva in Mar del Plata. They remained in pretrial detention at year's end. In October 2008 former army officials Alberto Barda, Hipolito Mariani, and Cesar Comes received sentences ranging from 25 years' to life imprisonment for human rights violations committed in the clandestine detention centers of Mansion Sere and La Cueva. In December the Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that 21 military officials accused of human rights violations during the military dictatorship be freed on bail, including two of the most notorious suspects, ex-naval captains Alfredo Astiz and Jorge Acosta. The three-judge panel noted that the men had spent more than five years in detention without a trial, far in excess of the two-year legal limit for pretrial detention. The prosecutors, CELS, and the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo subsequently appealed the decision, and the officers remained in detention pending a Supreme Court decision. The government sought to impeach the judges who ordered the release. There were no developments in the 2006 missing persons case of Jorge Julio Lopez, a key witness in the case against Miguel Etchecolatz, former commissioner general of the Buenos Aires Province police. Judicial authorities continued to investigate cases of kidnapping and illegal adoption by members of the former military dictatorship of children born to detained dissidents. At year's end, 96 of an estimated 500 persons born to detained and disappeared dissidents and illegally adopted had been identified and made aware of their true backgrounds. In April 2008 a court sentenced a military official to 10 years in prison for his role in facilitating the illegal adoption of Maria Eugenia Sampallo Barragan, the daughter of political dissidents killed during the military dictatorship. This was the first case of its kind, and Sampallo's adoptive parents were sentenced to seven and eight years' imprisonment.  Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment Although the law prohibits such practices and provides penalties for torture similar to those for homicide, there are reports that some police and prison guards continue to employ torture and brutality. CELS reported police brutality and occasional alleged torture of suspects, particularly during prison transfers. While the government has investigated such reports, there were few convictions. In 2008, according to CELS, a prison detainee in the Olmos, Buenos Aires, provincial prison asserted he had received knife injuries from a senior prison official in the presence of another prison official. A detainee in the Sierra Chica Prison in Buenos Aires Province filed a complaint for being subjected to solitary confinement for 45 days with no clothes or food. A 17-year-old minor also filed a complaint alleging that police agents in a police station in Hurlingham, Buenos Aires Province, subjected him to electrical shocks. Two lower ranking navy officials and a civilian remained in pretrial detention for the 2006 kidnapping, beating, torture, and killing of 15-year-old Lucas Ivarrola, were accused of stealing a television set. A trial date had not been set by year's end. Prison and detention center conditions The country's prisons remain in inhumane conditions, and prisoners often spend years in jail before trial. Police continue to abuse their power by hitting, and even torturing people in police stations. In fact, there have been instances of new desaparecidos (\\"disappeared\\").Marcela Valente, Argentina: 'Cruel, Inhumane' Prison Conditions in Mendoza , Inter Press Service, 24-11-2006, accessed 01-09-09. Prison conditions often are poor and life-threatening; in many facilities, extreme overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate medical and psychological treatment, inadequate sanitation, limited family visits, and frequent inhuman and degrading treatment are common, according to various reports by human rights organizations and research centers. The research center Unidos por la Justicia estimated prison overcrowding at 20 percent nationwide, while credible press reports estimated prison overcrowding in Buenos Aires Province exceeded 25 percent. The Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission's Committee Against Torture reported that, during the first 11 months of the year in Buenos Aires provincial prisons, there were 86 prisoner deaths and 5,169 violent incidents, resulting in injuries to 4,800 prisoners. According to an earlier report from the committee covering the first half of the year, authorities repressed violent incidents with rubber bullets and sticks on 564 occasions. The committee attributed the violence to inmate attacks on fellow prisoners and on prison officials. The committee also criticized the provincial prison health-care system. In April 2008 federal criminal prosecutor Francisco Mugnolo filed a case with the Supreme Court arguing that inadequate federal control over federal prisons resulted in human rights violations and torture of some prisoners. He also released a report claiming that 63 percent of federal prisoners in the second half of 2007 had experienced physical aggression. Also in April, Alfredo Emiliano Fleitas, a prisoner in Villa Devoto Prison, petitioned the courts for a writ of habeas corpus after having been beaten by prison guards in February during a transfer to Ezeiza Prison. Fleitas was hospitalized as a result of his injuries and underwent surgery to restore his vision. In August 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Supreme Court ordered the Provincial Criminal Court of Appeals to decide a collective habeas corpus case filed by CELS on behalf of provincial prisoners who were subject to mistreatment and violence during prison transfers. While women were held separately from men, the law permits children to stay in prison with their mothers until age four. Press reports estimated that 86 children under the age of four lived with their mothers in federal prisons, with an additional 75 in Buenos Aires provincial prisons. In general men's prisons were more violent, dangerous, and crowded than the women's prisons. Overcrowding in juvenile facilities often resulted in minors being held in police station facilities, although separate from adult detainees. According to a 2007 UN Children's Fund and National Secretariat for Human Rights report, these institutions held approximately 20,000 children, 20 percent of whom were under age 16. The overwhelming majority had not committed a crime; rather, they were abandoned by their families or considered \\"at risk\\" for other reasons. Pretrial detainees often were held with convicted prisoners. CELS estimated that 53 percent of those in federal prison were awaiting trial. In November 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Court initiated trial proceedings in the case against Buenos Aires Magdalena Provincial Prison Director Carlos Tejeda and 15 prison guards and officials accused of abandoning prisoners in a 2005 fire that killed 33 prisoners. The government permitted prison visits by local and international human rights observers, and such visits have been taking place.  Arbitrary arrest or detention The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observes these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrests and detains citizens arbitrarily on occasion. The federal police have jurisdiction for maintaining law and order in the federal capital and for federal crimes in the provinces. Other federal police authorities include the Airport Security Police, the Gendarmerie, the Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Prisons. Additionally, each province has its own police force that responds to a provincial security ministry or secretariat. Individual forces vary considerably in their effectiveness and respect for human rights. Corruption is widespread in some forces, and internal controls to counter police abuses are often weak. The most frequent abuses include extortion of, and protection for, those involved in drug trafficking, prostitution, and trafficking in persons. The federal security forces have the authority to conduct internal investigations into alleged abuses and to fire individuals who have allegedly committed a human rights violation. The federal government can also file complaints with the federal courts; provincial governments may do the same for provincial security forces. Members of security forces convicted of a crime were subject to stiff penalties. In 2008, authorities in Buenos Aires Province removed more than 700 police officers for corruption and other offenses. Police may detain suspects for up to 10 hours without an arrest warrant if the authorities have a well-founded belief that the suspects have committed, or are about to commit, a crime or are unable to determine the suspected person's identity. Human rights groups report that the police often detains suspects longer than 10 hours. The law provides a person in detention with the right to a prompt determination of the legality of the detention, which entails appearance before a criminal lower court judge, who determines whether to proceed with an investigation. There are frequent delays in this process and in informing detainees of the charges against them. The law provides for the right to bail, except in cases involving narcotics, violent crimes, and firearms violations. Although the bail system was used, civil rights groups claimed that judges were more likely to order the holding of indicted suspects in preventive or pretrial detention than to allow suspects to remain free pending their trial. In November 2008 the highest penal court broadly ruled that pretrial detention should be the exception to the rule, except in cases where a suspect represents a flight risk or may act to obstruct justice. Detainees are allowed prompt access to counsel, and public defenders were provided for detainees unable to afford counsel, although such access sometimes was delayed due to an overburdened system. Strong demand and a lack of resources for the Public Defender's Office results in an excessive caseload for public defense attorneys. Although there are no official statistics on the percentage of detainees requesting public defense attorneys, human rights organizations estimated that 80 percent requested public defense attorneys. Detainees also were allowed access to family members, although not always promptly. The law provides for investigative detention of up to two years for indicted persons awaiting or undergoing trial; the period may be extended for one year in limited situations. The slow pace of the justice system often resulted in lengthy detentions beyond the period stipulated by law. CELS reported that prisoners waited an average of three years to be tried, with some cases taking as long as six years to go to trial. A convicted prisoner usually received credit for time already served. In 2008, in Buenos Aires Province, provisional statistics from CELS indicated that nearly 75 percent of detainees were in pretrial detention, while the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission Committee Against Torture reported that 78 percent of the approximately 26,000 detainees in provincial prisons were awaiting trial. According to several human rights organizations, 30 percent of pretrial detainees were eventually acquitted. According to the Memory Commission's committee, there were approximately 6,500 complaints of human rights violations against juvenile detainees in provincial prisons and juvenile detention facilities, the majority of which were pending investigation. In July 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Supreme Court inaugurated an ad hoc juvenile justice system, which operated in eight out of 18 provincial districts. It provides minors age 16 to 18 the same procedural rights as adults and limits sentences to 180 days in prison. In August 2008 the minister of justice announced that he had instructed police forces to conform standard operating procedures for arresting minors to international standards; however, by year's end, there was no information on application of procedures. Denial of fair public trial The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary generally enforced this right. However, there are complaints that some lower court federal judges, provincial judges, and judicial personnel were inefficient and at times subject to political manipulation. Justice organizations are particularly critical of the lack of independence of lower court judges with federal jurisdiction in many provinces. The judicial system is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, inadequate administrative support, and general inefficiency caused by remnants of the inquisitorial criminal justice system used in federal and many provincial courts. Judges have broad discretion as to whether and how to pursue investigations, contributing to a public perception that many decisions were arbitrary. Allegations of corruption in provincial courts as well as federal courts located in the provinces were more frequent than federal courts with jurisdiction over the city and province of Buenos Aires, reflecting strong connections between the executive and judicial branches at the provincial level. In May 2008 the Congress passed a law establishing a process to appoint temporary judges in response to a 2007 Supreme Court order. However, legal scholars expressed concern that the law encourages delays in the selection of permanent judges and increases the executive branch's authority to appoint temporary judges without public vetting. At year's end, there were 160 vacant judgeships nationwide. There were some criticisms in the press that interim judges were subject to political manipulation due to the temporary nature of their position. The judicial system is divided into federal and provincial courts, both headed by a supreme court with appellate courts and district courts below it. The federal courts are divided between the criminal and civil courts. In August 2008 the Congress voted to abolish the military justice system, thus making members of the military subject to civil proceedings for crimes committed during peacetime and to a new military disciplinary code for infractions of military rules. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to legal counsel and to call defense witnesses in the federal and some provincial courts that have an accusatory system of criminal justice. If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when defendants face serious criminal charges. During the investigative stage, defendants can submit questions in writing to the investigating judge. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments in criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions. Although the 1994 constitution provides for trial by jury, implementing legislation had not been passed by year's end. In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of certain serious crimes have the right to a trial by jury. Lengthy delays in trials are a nationwide problem, with many cases taking five or more years to resolve. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to appeal, as do prosecutors. Minors under age 16 cannot be criminally prosecuted. By law defendants and attorneys have access to government held evidence, but they may experience significant obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence. In 2008, the human rights organization Fundacion Sur noted that the country lacked a separate juvenile justice system that affords adolescents due process protections and the right to a legal defense in criminal cases and expressed concern that the broad discretion judges have in such cases increased the possibility of arbitrary rulings. The age of legal liability is 16, and Fundacion Sur asserted that 16- and 17-year- old offenders frequently were transferred to adult criminal courts or held in juvenile detention centers for longer periods than warranted by their offenses. A December 2008 Supreme Court decision found that the country's juvenile justice system did not comply with international conventions and highlighted the need for the legislative branch to remedy the situation. There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees. There is an independent and impartial judiciary in civil matters, and anyone may bring lawsuits seeking damages or the protection of rights provided by the constitution. Government agencies, professional bar associations, universities, and NGOs provide free legal counseling and may represent indigent persons before civil courts as well as assist them in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence The constitution prohibits such actions, and the government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.  Civil liberties  Freedom of speech and press The constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice. Individuals can criticize the government publicly or privately, but there are criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for libel and slander, and government officials have sought to use these against the political opposition and other critics. The government pressed criminal libel and slander charges against Elisa Carrio, head of the opposition Civic Coalition party, for accusing officials in 2004 of corruption. In September 2008 Carrio won a civil case brought by the son of a deceased Peronist leader whom she accused of being involved in official corruption, murder, and drug trafficking; it was the second such case she had won. In December 2008 security forces arrested 26 \\"neo-Nazis,\\" including four minors, on discrimination charges for conducting a ceremony to commemorate the death of World War II German naval captain Hans Langsdorff. All individuals subsequently were released but still faced discrimination charges. Numerous FM radio stations continue to broadcast with temporary licenses pending conclusion of a licensing normalization process. In August 2008 AM radio signal Radio Continental, which had been critical of the government, filed a complaint before the Federal Broadcasting Committee (COMFER) for its decision to suspend its FM broadcast. Although the complaint was not resolved by year's end, COMFER did not enforce its decision, and the station continued to broadcast on the FM frequency. In August 2008 the Association for Civil Rights and the Open Society Justice Initiative published a report alleging that the government's allocation of state advertising funds affected press freedom. The report claimed that the government abused the distribution of state advertising to benefit or punish the press according to the tone of their coverage of the administration. This assessment coincided with press reports and comments made in private by media organization leaders. According to the Association for Civil Rights, the Neuquen provincial government had not complied by the end of 2008 with a 2007 Supreme Court order to present an official advertising distribution plan that would not indirectly curtail freedom of speech. The 2006 lawsuit lodged by the country's second largest media company, Grupo Editorial Perfil, against the federal government's use of government advertising as a means of indirect censorship remained pending at year's end. Journalist Sergio Poma died in January 2008 while awaiting appeal of a September 2007 Salta provincial court decision that sentenced him to a one-year suspended prison term and barred him from practicing journalism for one year for slandering the former governor of Salta. In November 2008 labor activists from the teamsters union, led by Hugo Moyano, vice president of the ruling Peronist Party and leader of the General Labor Confederation (CGT), blocked a newspaper distribution center jointly run by the country's two leading newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion. The union maintained that the protest was technically for better wage and working conditions for the teamsters that drive newspaper distribution trucks. However, media organizations and the opposition criticized the government failure to break up the blockade and called it a direct attack on press freedom; the two newspapers filed criminal charges against the perpetrators. There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitored e mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e mail. According to the government's National Statistics and Census Institute, there are more than three million residential Internet users. There are no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events.  Freedom of peaceful Assembly and Association The constitution provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the government generally respects these rights in practice.  Freedom of religion The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. The constitution also states that the federal government \\"sustains the apostolic Roman Catholic faith,\\" and the government provided the Catholic Church with a variety of subsidies not available to other religious groups. Other religious faiths were practiced freely. In order to hold public worship services, obtain visas for foreign missionaries, and obtain tax exempt status, religious organizations must register with the Secretariat of Worship in the Ministry of Foreign Relations, International Trade, and Worship and report periodically to maintain their status. Acts of discrimination and vandalism against religious minorities, particularly the 300,000 member Jewish community, continued. During the year, the Delegation of Israeli Argentine Associations (DAIA) received approximately 202 complaints of anti Semitic acts. The most commonly reported incidents were desecration of Jewish cemeteries, anti Semitic graffiti, verbal slurs, and other forms of harassment. In August 2008 Raul Arenas Vega was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for the 2006 beating of an Orthodox Jewish teenager in Buenos Aires. The investigation continued into the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires that killed 85 persons. In May 2008 a federal prosecutor called for the indictment of former President Carlos Menem, former federal judge Juan Galeano, and others for their alleged role in covering up and protecting those involved in the attack. Subsequently, the presiding federal judge, following recommendations from the AMIA Special Prosecutor, issued an international request for the seizure of assets belonging to eight Iranians and Hezbollah to cover damages being claimed by the civil suit brought against the perpetrators. In December the judge ordered the seizure of six commercial properties allegedly belonging to a former Iranian cultural attache who was among those accused of aiding in the attack. There are still no developments in DAIA's case against activists from the left wing group Quebracho that prevented Jewish community groups from demonstrating in front of the Iranian Embassy in 2006. The government continues to support a public dialogue to highlight past discrimination and to encourage improved religious tolerance.  Freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation The constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights in practice. The government cooperates with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, and other persons of concern. The law prohibits forced exile, and the government did not exile anyone. The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. The government granted refugee status or asylum. The law allows the government to provide temporary protection for humanitarian reasons, including family reunification, to individuals who may not qualify as refugees under the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol. According to the government's Refugee Eligibility Committee, in the first 11 months of 2008, 745 persons sought asylum, and the government granted refugee status to 89 persons. The government continues to cooperate with the UNHCR to resettle at risk Colombian refugees. According to the UNHCR, the country also resettled 39 Colombians in the first six months of the year. In practice the government provides protection against the expulsion or return of refugees to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened. The government grants refugee status and temporary protection for humanitarian reasons.  Political rights  Elections and political participation The law provides citizens the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections based on universal suffrage. National presidential and legislative elections took place in October 2007. At the national level, one half of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and one third of those in the Senate were contested. The media, the Ministry of Justice, and various NGOs observed the elections and judged them free and fair, although several opposition parties filed a complaint alleging that ballots listing opposition candidates were not available at voting stations in some provinces. Provincial elections in Santiago del Estero Province took place in orderly fashion in November. Political parties generally operated without restriction. Decrees provide that one third of the members of both houses of congress must be women, a goal achieved through balanced election slates. There were 28 women in the 72 seat Senate and 103 women in the 256 seat Chamber of Deputies. The president, two of the seven Supreme Court justices, and four cabinet ministers were women. Women constituted approximately 17 percent of top executive-branch positions at the federal level. One indigenous person served in the Chamber of Deputies. There were no other known ethnic or racial minorities in the national legislature. There were no known indigenous, ethnic, or racial minorities in the cabinet or on the Supreme Court.  Government corruption and transparency The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption; however, there were frequent press reports that executive officials engaged in corrupt practices, suggesting a failure to implement the law effectively. According to the World Bank's worldwide governance indicators, government corruption is a serious problem. Historically weak institutions and an often ineffective and politicized judicial system make rooting out corruption in any systemic fashion difficult. Public officials are subject to financial disclosure laws, and the Ministry of Justice's Anti Corruption Office (ACO) is responsible for analyzing and investigating federal executive branch officials based on their financial disclosure forms. The ACO also is responsible for investigating corruption within the federal executive branch or in matters involving federal funds, except for funds transferred to the provinces. Although nominally a part of the judicial branch, the ACO does not have authority to prosecute cases independently, but it can refer cases to other agencies or serve as the plaintiff and request a judge to initiate a case. Individual judges investigated most high-profile corruption cases, but prosecutions were not expected in a number of such cases that began in 2007. The minister of defense dismissed 31 senior officers and officials in August 2008 and another 13 in September 2008 following investigations into corrupt practices, and in September the army chief of staff resigned following his indictment over the illegal diversion of public funds in 2002 in another command. Judicial authorities were pursuing the investigations with the ministry's support. According to press reports, the minister of health continued to push for greater transparency in the procurement of pharmaceuticals by the agency responsible for providing medicines to senior citizens following allegations of price fixing and overcharging by suppliers, many of whom were also reportedly prominent campaign contributors in 2007. In November 2008 the agency head resigned at the government's request. In December 2008 a foreign plea agreement by the German corporation Siemens identified by their initials and titles several high level officials in former governments as having accepted multimillion-dollar bribes in the controversial procurement of a national identification card system. Investigations conducted by the NGO Poder Ciudadano in June and the National Electoral Court in September 2008 cited irregularities in the campaign finance reports of the 2007 presidential candidates. Their findings concluded that some candidates underreported their official campaign expenses, particularly regarding advertising costs; others overreported their expenses; and some received anonymous donations, which is prohibited by law. Poder Ciudadano's report also alleged that public resources were used to promote President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's campaign. An executive decree provides for public access to government information from executive agencies, which are required to answer requests for public information within 10 working days, with a possible 10-day extension. The capacity to comply with this requirement, however, varies across executive agencies. Poder Ciudadano estimates that executive branch agencies answered such requests within the required timeframe approximately 70 percent of the time. The NGO notes that politically sensitive requests, such as the operational costs of the presidency, often were delayed or went unanswered.  Governmental response to investigation of alleged human rights violations A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups generally operates without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials usually are cooperative and generally responsive to their views. While the government cooperates with some international and local NGOs, the local chapter of a well-known international organization expressed concern in 2008 that, despite repeated requests, the government did not provide information under a freedom of information decree. The government has a Human Rights Secretariat and a National Ombudsman's Office.  Discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking in persons The law prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, disability, language, or social status, and the government generally enforced these prohibitions in practice.  Women thumb In 1985, Argentina ratified the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).Ocampo, Irene. Women's human rights in Argentina: advances, setbacks and the tasks ahead. (National Contexts). Women's Health Collection. 01-01-03. Accessed 01-09-09. Despite this, women are the constant target of aggressive machism. Domestical violence including marital rape, widespread pornography and teenaged female prostitution as well as political underrepresentation are effects of the Argentinian machist patriarchy.\\"Hoy a las mujeres, desde muy ni√±as, se les env√≠a el mensaje de que es necesario ser joven, bonita y atractiva, as√≠ como tener un cuerpo delgado y bien formado: releg√°ndolas a un rol pasivo, en el cual son dependientes de los hombres y buscan tenerlos satisfechos. Por lo general tienen un papel secundario y se las ubica en la casa, en la familia o en trabajos profesionales que dependen de figuras masculinas.\\", Buglione, Laura - Kremky, Ma. Eugenia; La Televisi√≥n Argentina y el machismo, Monografias. Accessed 01-10-09. Domestic violence in Argentina against women is a serious problem. Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime, but the need for proof, either in the form of clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. In August 2008 Amnesty International reported that a woman died every two days as a result of domestic violence. According to press reports quoting the Buenos Aires Provincial Ministry of Security statistics, 52,351 complaints of domestic abuse were filed at the Women's Police Stations in Buenos Aires Province in the first 10 months of the year. Trafficking of women to and within the country for prostitution is a problem.  Children Although the government voices strong commitment to children's rights and welfare, many programs remain underfunded. In September 2008 the Congress passed a law that maintained the 40-day timeframe in which parents can register the birth of their children but reduced from six years to 20 days the time thereafter for the state to register the births if parents failed to do so. For a birth occurring without medical assistance or outside a medical center, the government may authorize late registration up until one year after the birth; thereafter, only judges may order birth registrations. While the law provides for free and compulsory education for 13 years, beginning at age five, it has not been enforced effectively. The governor of Buenos Aires estimates that there were approximately 400,000 children who neither worked nor attended school in Buenos Aires Province alone. Child abuse continues to occur and is not uncommon; for example, a University of Buenos Aires study released in August 2008 noted that 56 kindergartens and primary schools in Buenos Aires Province had detected 1,590 cases of family violence in the previous year. The government does however take some measures to combat child abuse. The National Council for Children, Adolescents, and the Family continues to conduct public awareness campaigns and operates a national hot line, which children use to call for advice, make complaints, and report instances of abuse or other rights violations. Prosecutors and police pursue cases of Internet child pornography. In June 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing child pornography; however, the law does not penalize possession by individuals for personal use. The press and local NGOs reported that children were involved in sexual exploitation, sex tourism, and drug trafficking. Drawing on police statistics, the press estimates that approximately 5,000 children are recruited every year for pornography activities and sex tourism. According to credible local press reports, dozens of child victims of violence from poor families are lodged in juvenile detention centers under judicial protection orders. City government observers are barred from visiting the centers. Local NGO Fundacion Sur express concern that the children may be subject to inhumane conditions and submitted a writ of habeas corpus in 2008 asking the courts to release the children and investigate the 2007 cases of two adolescents who allegedly committed suicide in separate incidents after having been raped while in detention. In December 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the petition but acknowledged the need to pass legislation to bring the juvenile justice system into compliance with international norms. In December 2008 the newspaper La Nacion reported that a local NGO estimated that 3,000 children under five years of age died from malnourishment in 2008, down one-third since 2003. On 6 October 2020, Human Rights Watch raised concerns over the publishing of child suspects‚Äô private data online. HRW sent letters to Argentinian President Alberto Fern√°ndez and Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta, the mayor of Buenos Aires city, saying that the policies and practices violate international obligations to respect children‚Äôs privacy in criminal proceedings. Human trafficking In April 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing trafficking in persons, largely due to the Marita Veron case. The country is still a source, transit point, and destination for trafficked persons. Trafficking in persons primarily involves citizens trafficked within the country for the purposes of sexual and labor exploitation. They were trafficked mostly from the northern provinces to the central provinces and Buenos Aires and from Buenos Aires to several southern provinces. To a lesser degree, the country is a destination for victims, principally women and minors from Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, and Brazil. While there are no official reports on the activities of traffickers, the media reports that traffickers often present themselves as employment agencies or as individual recruiters. Credible sources also identify large organized crime networks, which sometimes consisted of extended families plus their business associates, including recruiters and brothel managers. Traffickers confiscated travel documents to prevent victims from appealing to authorities for protection. Victims, particularly women and girls in prostitution, at times are denied contact with the outside world. Victims often are threatened or beaten. Traffickers can be prosecuted under the new federal law, which provides penalties for trafficking ranging from three to 15 years in prison, depending on the nature of the violation and the age of the victim. Traffickers have been prosecuted on charges of prostitution through fraud, intimidation, and coercion or, in the case of minors, alien smuggling, indentured servitude, and similar abuses. Trafficking investigations and arrests increased in 2008. According to Ministry of Justice statistics, internal security agencies conducted 118 raids, arrested 120 persons suspected of human trafficking, and rescued 133 victims in the six-month period after the law took effect in late April. However, only 33 of those arrested remained in detention as of November. Official statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions for trafficking during the year were unavailable. The Ministry of Justice was the lead agency for coordinating antitrafficking efforts with internal security agencies. There are no allegations of federal government official involvement in trafficking. However, there are reports of widespread corruption and collusion with traffickers at provincial and local levels, which impeded prosecution. There are some efforts to investigate and prosecute local police and officials suspected of involvement in human trafficking. There are no developments in the investigation of local police and official involvement in a 2006 case where women were forced into prostitution in Chubut Province. Press reports indicated that the two former police officers, who were charged in 2006, were reassigned without facing disciplinary actions. In March, 14 women were rescued from forced prostitution in brothels that continued to operate in the area. In December 2008 a federal judge summoned the police commissioner, his deputy, and three other police officials for deposition as part of an investigation into alleged police protection of a ring of brothels suspected of human trafficking in the Mataderos neighborhood of Buenos Aies. In the same case, a woman running the brothel was indicted as an accessory to human trafficking, and her sister was also under investigation at year's end. Trafficking victims normally are not detained, jailed, or deported. The Ministry of Justice's training seminars for internal security forces included a component emphasizing that they not blame trafficking victims for illegal activities they may have become involved in as a consequence of their exploitation. Limited victims' assistance is provided by the Ministry of Justice's First Responder Office for the Rescue and Immediate Assistance of Trafficking Victims. It refers minor and adult victims rescued in the city or province of Buenos Aires to the Ministry of Social Development's Secretariat for Children, Adolescents, and the Family, which then may direct victims to existing social and medical assistance programs. Victims in other provinces usually were assisted by the relevant human rights secretariat. The Prosecutor General's Office of Victim's Assistance continues to provide assistance on an as-needed basis. Although it does not operate victim shelters dedicated to trafficking, the government funds one NGO to operate a victim's shelter. Some victims qualified for federal government assistance, but most provincial officials are not trained to identify or help victims of trafficking specifically. The International Organization for Migration assists with repatriation and reintegration of foreign victims of trafficking.  Persons with disabilities The constitution and laws prohibit discrimination against people with physical or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, but the government does not effectively enforce these laws. A specific law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, the government does not effectively enforce it. Laws mandating greater access to buses and trains for persons with disabilities also are not enforced fully. In March 2008 a federal court ordered the Buenos Aires subway operator Metrovias to make subway stations handicapped accessible. According to the Association for Civil Rights, only 12 of 73 subway stations were handicapped accessible. According to the National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI), an estimated 20,000 children with disabilities were unable to attend school in Buenos Aires City in 2008 because the buildings were not handicapped accessible. In March 2008 the Buenos Aires City Ombudsman pressed charges against eight long-distance bus companies for failing to provide free bus tickets to persons with disabilities, as required by decree. Thereafter, INADI established a permanent office at the main bus terminal in Buenos Aires City and maintained a presence at many train and bus stations throughout the city on a rotational basis. A 2007 study by CELS and international NGO Mental Disability Rights International reported that 25,000 persons were detained in psychiatric institutions, more than 80 percent for more than a year. The report documented egregious cases of abuse and neglect in psychiatric institutions, including patients burned to death in isolation cells, the use of sensory deprivation in long-term isolation, and physical and sexual violence. The report also detailed dangerous and unhygienic conditions, including the lack of running water, nonfunctioning sewer systems, and fire and safety hazards. The National Advisory Committee for the Integration of People with Disabilities, under the National Council for Coordination of Social Policies, has formal responsibility for actions to accommodate persons with disabilities.  Indigenous people The constitution recognizes the ethnic and cultural identities of indigenous people and states that the Congress shall protect their right to bilingual education, recognize their communities and the communal ownership of their ancestral lands, and allow for their participation in the management of their natural resources. In practice indigenous people do not fully participate in the management of their lands or natural resources, in part because responsibility for implementing the law is delegated to the 23 provinces, only 11 of which have constitutions recognizing indigenous rights. Although there is no formal process to recognize indigenous tribes or determine who is an indigenous person, indigenous communities can register with the provincial or federal government as a civic association. Estimates of the indigenous population ranged from 700,000 to 1.5 million. Poverty rates are higher than average in areas with large indigenous populations. Indigenous people have greater than average rates of illiteracy, chronic disease, and unemployment. The lack of trained teachers hampers government efforts to offer bilingual education opportunities to indigenous people. According to indigenous rights experts, 75 percent of disputed territory in Jujuy, which had been the subject of court orders in 2006 and 2007, was either returned to indigenous communities or in the titling process by the end of 2008. In October 2008 the Supreme Court overruled a Salta provincial court decision to turn down an appeal by the Eben Ezer indigenous community, which asked the provincial court to issue an injunction preventing the sale of provincial land previously considered a natural reserve. The Supreme Court indicated that the provincial court's decision violated the constitution and instructed the provincial court to take into consideration the rights of indigenous people to use the resources found on ancestral lands. In December 2008, in response to a lawsuit filed by 18 indigenous communities, the Supreme Court ordered Salta Province to suspend plans to cut approximately of forest, pending the outcome of a further hearing. According to a Minority Rights Group International report from 2008, many provinces evicted indigenous communities from ancestral lands to sell the land to multinational companies, particularly for petroleum, mining, soy industries, and tourism development. In December 2008, after protesters from the Mapuche community staged a roadblock, the Chubut Provincial Supreme Court suspended a lower court order evicting a Mapuche family from land they had occupied since 1940. The protesters expressed concern that Chubut Province would evict more indigenous families to provide concessions to mining companies. The land dispute between the Mbya Guaran√≠ community and La Plata National University over claims to territory in Misiones Province is still without resolution. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) continues to evaluate a petition presented by the Lhaka Honhat indigenous association regarding the national government's failure to implement a titling policy that would return their traditional land. The Lhaka Honhat association sent a letter to the IACHR in September 2008 asking for greater involvement and a timely resolution to the case. In October 2008 three Mapuche families occupied land in the National Park of Nahuel Huapi in Neuquen Province in an attempt to obtain for other Mapuche communities. Park officials indicated that they already coexisted with five Mapuche communities in the area. Also in October 2008 the first indigenous radio station, the Indigenous Voice, began broadcasting programs aimed at indigenous communities in Salta Province.  LGBT rights During 2008, INADI received 82 complaints of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, 38 of which were resolved rapidly. In July 2008 authorities arrested Sergio Alfredo Nunez, Silvio Elias Soria, and Cesar Javier Ulivarri in connection with the 2006 killing of transgender activist Pelusa Liendro, who was found stabbed in her car 10 days after the broadcast of an undercover videotape she and other activists made of police harassment and abuse of transgender persons in Salta Province. Nunez and Soria remained in pretrial detention at year's end. The court stayed legal proceedings against Rodolfo Aguilares and two other individuals. Significant improvements have been observed in protection of LGBT rights in Argentina in the 2010s. Same-sex marriage was legalized in July 2010. In August 2008 the National Social Security Administration granted widowed homosexual partners the rights to inherit their partner's pension. Eligible partners must demonstrate that they lived with their partner for at least five years. INADI received 62 discrimination complaints on the basis of HIV positive status, 34 of which were resolved rapidly. The law prohibits termination of employment of HIV positive employees.  Intersex rights  Intersex people in Argentina have no recognition of their rights to physical integrity and bodily autonomy, and no specific protections from discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics. Cases also exist of children being denied access to birth certificates without their parents being pressured into consenting to medical interventions.  Labor rights Right of association The law provides all workers, with the exception of military personnel, the right to form and join \\"free and democratic labor unions, recognized by simple inscription in a special register,\\" and workers exercised this right. An estimated 35 to 40 percent of the workforce was organized. The Argentine Workers Central (CTA) and other labor groups not affiliated with the CGT contends that the Trade Unions Law provision for the legal recognition of only one union per sector conflicts with the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 87 and prevents the CTA from obtaining full legal standing. In November 2008 the Supreme Court declared Article 41 of the Trade Unions Law unconstitutional and upheld the right of a workers' union lacking official legal recognition to elect its own delegates. In addition the ruling asserted that the Ministry of Labor's discretion in awarding official union recognition violates international treaties. The IACHR continues to review the CTA's 2004 petition to this day. Unions have the right to strike, although those representing civil servants and workers in essential services are subject to the condition that undefined \\"minimum services\\" are rendered. In some cases \\"minimum services\\" have already been incorporated in union bargaining agreements, but since the law does not define \\"minimum services,\\" civil servants and workers in essential services have the right to strike only after a compulsory 15-day conciliation process. Once that term expires, civil servants and workers in essential services must give five days' notice to the administrative authority and the public agency that they intend to strike. All parties then negotiate which minimum services will continue to be provided and a schedule for their provision. The public agency, in turn, must provide two days' notice to users about the intended strike. Other workers exercised the right to strike by conducting legal strikes. Right to organize and bargain collectively The law provides unions with the right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements and to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration. The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security ratifies collective bargaining agreements, which covers roughly 75 percent of the formally employed workforce. According to the ILO, the ratification process impedes free collective bargaining because the ministry considered not only whether a collective labor agreement contained clauses violating public order standards but also whether the agreement complied with productivity, investment, technology, and vocational training criteria. However, there are no known cases of government refusal to approve any collective agreements under these criteria. There are no special laws or exemptions from regular labor laws in the three functioning export processing zones. Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor While the law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including by children, there were isolated reports that such practices occurred. In April police rescued 30 Bolivians, including children, who were working under exploitative conditions at a poultry farm in Capilla del Senor, Buenos Aires Province. In August 2008 the press reported that children and other workers were working in exploitative conditions at other farms owned by the same company. The provincial ministry of labor fined the company 364,000 pesos ($117,400) and was reviewing additional forced labor complaints, including two deaths, lodged against the company. Press reports indicated the company had not paid the fine by year's end. In September 2008 an appeals court reversed a lower court decision dismissing a case of forced labor against the owners of a prestigious garment company that employed Bolivians working in sweatshops under exploitative conditions. The lower court had dismissed the case on the basis that the Bolivians were culturally predisposed to working under such conditions. The case remains under investigation. In September 2008 a federal judge indicted the owner and the manager of a garment sweatshop that employed 50 Bolivians, including 20 minors. The judge froze 900,000 pesos ($290,000) in assets belonging to the owner and seized and transferred sewing machines to a social organization of the employees' choosing so they could continue working. The case remained pending at year's end. A Buenos Aires city court released four individuals in 2008 on probation in a 2006 case of forced labor. According to a local antislavery NGO, the individuals were charged for their role in operating clothing sweatshops in the Flores Sur neighborhood that left six Bolivian citizens dead and affected potentially hundreds more. Prohibition of child labor and minimum age for employment The law protects children from exploitation in the workplace. In 2004 the National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labor (CONAETI) estimated that up to 1.5 million children, or 22 percent of children under the age of 15, worked in some capacity, an estimate still considered valid. In June 2008 the Congress passed a law raising the minimum age for employment from 14 to 15, which will increase to 16; in rare cases the Ministry of Education may authorize a younger child to work as part of a family unit. Children between the ages of 15 and 18 may work in a limited number of job categories and for limited hours if they have completed compulsory schooling, which normally ends at age 18. Legal penalties for employing underage workers ranged from 1,000 to 5,000 pesos ($303 to $1,515) for each child employed. Provincial governments and the city government of Buenos Aires are responsible for labor law enforcement. Most illegal child labor takes place in the informal sector, where inspectors have limited ability to enforce the law. Child labor includes such work as small scale garment production, trash recycling, street sales, domestic service, and food preparation and agricultural production. CONAETI conducts seminars with the 19 provincial commissions for the eradication of child labor to train provincial authorities responsible for enforcing labor laws and raising awareness regarding exploitive child labor. It also provides technical assistance to NGOs addressing child labor in the tobacco and trash-picking sectors, including workshops with tobacco producers to encourage corporate social responsibility on child labor issues. The government works with several NGOs to address the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the triborder area with Brazil and Paraguay, disseminating information on prevention and available assistance for victims. A trinational network involving local government and civil society was established in 2008 to help coordinate the antitrafficking efforts. The government participates in the MERCOSUR \\"Nino Sur\\" (\\"Southern Child\\") initiative to defend the rights of children and adolescents in the region. The initiative includes unified public campaigns against commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking and child labor, mutual technical assistance, and the exchange of best practices related to victims protection and assistance. The Ministry of Education also provides scholarships to reintegrate school dropouts and supported children who work and attend school. The program also provides parents with job search assistance and job training. Acceptable conditions of work The government increased the monthly minimum wage in October, bringing the total monthly minimum wage to 1,440 pesos ($387). This exceeded the estimated amount of 1,013 ($272) a month needed by a family of four to maintain a \\"decent\\" standard of living. Most workers in the formal sector earned significantly more than the minimum wage. The Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing legislation related to working conditions, continued inspections to get companies to register their informal workers. In November the Ministry of Labor reported informal urban unemployment at 40 percent. According to a 2007 ILO study, 60 percent of employed citizens ages 15 to 24 were engaged in informal labor. Federal labor law sets standards in the areas of health, safety, and hours. The maximum workday is eight hours, and the maximum workweek is 48 hours. Overtime pay is required for hours worked in excess of these limits. The law sets minimums for periods of rest, requiring a minimum of 12 hours of rest to start a new workday. Sundays are holidays, and those required to work on Sundays are paid double. However, laws governing acceptable conditions of work were not enforced universally, particularly for workers in the informal sector. The law requires employers to ensure their employees against accidents at the workplace and when traveling to and from work. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthy work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However, workers who leave the workplace before it has been proven unsafe risk being fired; in such cases the worker has the right to judicial appeal, but the process can be very lengthy.United States Department of State References Category:Government of Argentina Category:Argentine society Category:Politics of Argentina ","title":"Human rights in Argentina"},{"id":"24203874","text":"Farasuto Forest is a relict patch of what might best be described as ‚Äòwet evergreen forest‚Äô though the place is only really wet during the rains ‚Äì broadly from June to October. About a century ago most of the Gambia was reported to be covered by dense and almost impenetrable forest even after large areas had been cleared for groundnut cultivation. At that time the forests were rich in wildlife and habitat for a variety of large mammals which are nowadays rare (such as hippopotamus, waterbuck, roan) or extinct (such as buffalo, giraffe, elephant, lion etc.)‚Äù FAO Corporate Document Repository. Farasuto Forest is among the few remaining and now isolated forest patches left in the whole of the Gambia. It transpires that the forest surrounding Farasuto was cut down about 60 years ago (from local information), that is in the late 1940s. The section which is now the reserve was in earlier days used as a place for ceremonial male and female circumcisions and was therefore spared. It may be compared with the somewhat larger Abuko forest which will be known to many visitors to the country. Abuko is the Gambia's largest remnant block of forest (around 45 ha, 110 acres; more if you include the reserve's woodland) and is apparently the Gambia's most visited tourist destination. Farasuto Forest is small in comparison (4.5ha, 11 acres) and lies about 10 miles south-east of Abuko. Fauna The Gambia's remaining forests accommodate a singular suite of organisms. The assembly of birds unique to West African forests is well-known, generally well documented and is also outlined here. Other forest plants and animals are equally restricted in their occurrence, unique to the habitat though less is readily available about them and there are fewer specialists identifying and recording them, certainly not in comparison to the attention accorded to forest birds. Flora In comparison with the remainder of the site's flora the identification and mapping of trees is likely to be a shade more straightforward. The number of tree species is probably less than that for other flowering plants and help has already been offered by the Western District Forest Department's Eco-tourism Officer. The larger specimen trees should be relatively easy to list, number, measure, identify to species and map. A hand-held GPS unit has been donated to the group and during the dry season it should be possible to get signals through the forest canopy and determine precise positions for the larger trees. When the trees are identified and mapped it should be possible to assess their conservation importance ‚Äì it is believed that some of the forest trees are significant rarities ‚Äì time will tell. Similarly it should be possible to use GPS to obtain exact locations for the larger ant-hill/termite mounds and other prominent features such as pathway junctions which will help produce a definitive map of the site, essential for the proposed Management Plan. Why Farasuto The significance of Farasuto forest is fully understood by the people of Kuloro, the village within which the site lies on the southern banks of the Gambia River 11 miles due south of the capital Banjul. Local people concerned about the site (the forest patch and some adjoining woodland, total area around 9ha) and its future held the first public Open Day there on 25 October 2008. the forest project founders were introduced to the site during a three- week visit to country in January 2009 and an open meeting was arranged, with all village interests attending, on 20 January. Through an interpreter they explained that they were prepared to help prepare a Management Plan for their nature reserve. The offer of help was very gratefully and warmly received and work has begun. The Management Plan is an essential component in plotting a secure future for the site and its wildlife, not least its birds ‚Äì its major attraction. The Plan will also act as a bidding document for the works identified as necessary for successful and sustainable management into the long term.

Her father, Sir Neil Douglas, KCB, KCH (dies 1853) was a Scottish officer and Lieutenant General in the British army. Her mother was the daughter of a wealthy banker in Edinburgh. In her youth, she studied the Greek, Latin and German languages in Brussels (1831‚Äì1840). She met Queen Victoria in 1842. On her father's travels in the East she learned to speak Hindi. She first married James Allen (1846‚Äì1849) who died of cholera, then Neil Ferguson, who died in the Crimean War. In London she had met the famous Norwegian violinist and theatre founder Ole Bull. She came to Sunndal, in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway on her honeymoon with her third husband (married 6 December 1865), Hon William Arbuthnott, son of 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott.Sunndal si ukrona dronning, Lady Arbuthnott (√òyavis) They were divorced, after her 20-year-old son from her first marriage died, allegedly because she thought her husband had provoked an epileptic fit by quarrelling with her son, who then died at Fokstua coach inn on 15 September 1868.Barbara Arbuthnott av Odd Selmer (Bokpyrens lesedagbok) She was renowned, among other things, for driving her sick son with a horse and wagon across the Dovrefjell mountain range, while trying to save his life. After her son's death she bought the farm L√∏ken, which is now a local museum.Leikvin kulturminnepark (Aktivum Midt-Norge AS) She then cleared the land for a new farm, Elverh√∏y. She taught herself to speak Norwegian, cohabited with the translator, Oluf Endresen from Sunndal, and was said to be very generous, giving magnificent parties for the bourgeoisie. She took an interest in the local health service and the local rifle club, founded a local library and was an agricultural pioneer. She brought poultry and swine from Great Britain to the valley. And she wrote books about chicken farming, The Henwife (1861) and The Henwife ‚Äì Her own experience in her own Poultry-Yard (1870). She had built Alfheim, the mountain farm high up above the valley of Gr√∏dalen, in 1876. Her English bank went bankrupt in 1886. She sold some of its properties, but bankruptcy and forced sales was inevitable. She lived with the local teacher Lars Hoaas. Her board and lodging were paid for by benevolent neighbours.
