During his 60-year career, Clark was responsible for designing hundreds of buildings in the Washington area, including homes, hotels, churches, apartments and commercial properties. He is considered one of the city's most prominent and influential architects from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of his designs are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Early life During the Civil War, Clark's family moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., shortly before his birth on November 13, 1865. His father was a lawyer and prominent local Republican who was a strong advocate of voting rights for African Americans. After graduating from Central High School in 1883, Clark apprenticed with prominent architect Alfred B. Mullett until 1885. He then traveled to Europe to observe and study the continent's famous buildings, and returned to Washington in 1886 where he opened his own practice. In 1891, he married Vermont native Florence Perry with whom he had two children, Waldo and Marguerite. Career Clark originally designed buildings in the Romanesque Revival style, influenced by his time working with Mullett. Examples include Eastern Presbyterian Church (now Imani Temple) at 609 Maryland Avenue NE (built 1891) and the Washington Post Building at 1337 E Street NW (built 1893, razed 1954). Like other architects, his design preferences changed throughout his career. His works include buildings designed in the Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, Shingle and Spanish Colonial Revival styles. Many of his house designs used the Georgian Revival style, including the Thomas Gales House (now the Embassy of Myanmar) at 2300 S Street NW, and the J. Philip Herrmann House (now the Embassy of Syria) at 2215 Wyoming Avenue NW. One of his house designs, built in 1900 for The Washington Post editor Beriah Wilkins, was a 35-room French Colonial mansion at 1711 Massachusetts Avenue NW (demolished) that was one of the largest residences in the city at the time of its construction. Owl's Nest, designed by Clark in 1897. Clark's residential designs were not limited to houses. He designed 27 apartment buildings in Washington, D.C., including The Presidential at 1026 16th Street NW, The Rockingham at 1317 Rhode Island Ave NW and The Roosevelt at 2101 16th Street NW. Clark also specialized in designing commercial and public properties, including fifteen banks and five schools. The only known federal property designed by Clark is the U.S. Civil Service Commission Building. Clark was active with several professional and business organizations. He was \\"very active in civic affairs and viewed architecture as a vehicle for civic betterment.\\" He was a member of the Washington Board of Trade and American Institute of Architects (AIA), serving as president of the AIA's local chapter. He also served on the board of directors of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, the Terminal Refrigerating and Warehousing Company, the Washington Hotel Company and the Washington Sanitary Housing Company. Clark was also an author, writing the \\"History of Architecture in Washington\\" for Volume II of John Clagett Proctor‚Äôs Washington: Past and Present, and Institutional Homes for Children, a book advocating for improved residential facilities for orphans. He was a strong advocate for these improved facilities and designed three children's homes in the Washington area. Later years and legacy Clark retired around 1945 and maintained two homes, one at 1717 Lanier Place NW in Lanier Heights, and a winter home in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was hospitalized in 1955 for a broken hip while in St. Petersburg and died on March 25. In his obituary, The Washington Post referred to him as the \\"Dean of Architects.\\" He left an estate of approximately $700,000 to his family members. Clark is now considered one of \\"Washington's most influential architects\\" and one of the \\"most prominent and prolific early twentieth century architects.\\" Several of Clark's designs, including buildings he designed expansions or alterations, are now listed on the NRHP, including: 1644-1666 Park Road NW, 1833 Park Road NW, the Christian Heurich Mansion, Engine Company 21, the John Mercer Langston School, the National Saving And Trust Company, Riggs National Bank, Second Baptist Church, Second National Bank and the U.S. Civil Service Commission Building.

They had been invited in the war-torn West African country by the Finnish NGO Finn Church Aid. Moved by the condition of women in Liberia, the founders of Women's Bank set out to establish a 'women-to-women' framework. Funds raised by voluntary work would benefit women in developing countries, providing necessary assistance, training and capital to earn their own livelihood. Focus on women The project's focus on women is based on the specific, and quite often underprivileged condition of women globally. Women and girls are an untapped resource for development in developing countries. According to Women's Bank and numerous voices in the field, improving the status and the livelihood of women is the single most important way of eradicating poverty and improving the standard of living, benefitting not only individuals or families, but whole communities. Some Women's Bank projects have specific roles for men, they are also included in other facets of the network. Women are in the foreground of Women's Bank however, in an attempt to extend the independence and status enjoyed by many of their Finnish counterparts. Recognition In 2012 Women's Bank was awarded the Fundraiser of the Year title in Finland, by the Finnish Fundraising Association (VaLa ry). The same year spokeswoman of Women's Bank Management Group, Ritva Ohmeroluoma, was nominated among the three finalists in the Outstanding Volunteer category of the Global Awards for Fundraising 2012 competition. This was the first time Finnish volunteers were acknowledged internationally for their contributions. Reeta Sabharwal from the Action For Autism received the first prize for raising funds for the autistic in India. The prizes were awarded in the Netherlands at the International Fundraising Conference. Structure Local groups Women's Bank has 35 active local groups around Finland. Groups consisting of volunteers organize fundraising activities and events. In 2014 local groups in Finland held over 500 events. Funds thus raised are channeled to projects in developing countries. For a list of local groups, contact details and more information, follow this link(available in Finnish). National campaigns Alongside local events Women's Bank organizes nationwide events every year. A marked example is the 'Walk a Profession for a Woman', a walking event organized in September, often involving other forms of outdoor exercise. Participants donate 30 euros upon signing up; the sum estimated to cover the vocational training (i.e.: profession) of a woman in one of Women's Bank's project locations. In 2014 over ‚Ç¨20 000 were raised at the event, which equals to 1991 professions for women in developing countries. 27 local groups of Women's Bank participated in the fundraising event. Funded projects Funds raised by Women's Bank volunteers go to the following targets (administered by FCA): *Projects improving women's income, skills and rights *Microloans, upgrading skills and other projects in support of women's business activities *Other pilot projects focusing on businesses set up by women Implementation Women's Bank's projects are evaluated and carried out by Finn Church Aid, a Finnish NGO with decades of experience in humanitarian aid, development cooperation and a wide network of professionals available for assisting project tasks.

Running as an independent candidate, Madhu won the mayor election of the Raigarh Municipal Corporation, securing 33,168 votes and defeating the nearest rival, the ruling party BJP's Mahaveer Guruji, by 4,537 votes. She is India's only openly transgender mayor.  Prior to elections  Madhu Bai was previously known as Naresh Chauhan and has an eighth-grade education. As a teenager, Madhu left her family to join the local transgender community. She belongs to the Dalit community in India. Before assuming office, Madhu Bai earned a living by taking up odd jobs and by singing and dancing on the streets of Raigarh and performing in trains going on the Howrah-Mumbai route. She ran for mayor's office on a budget of 60,000 to 70,000 rupees, saying that it was upon the insistence of a few aggrieved citizens that she decided to contest the elections. Before Madhu, Kamla Jan was elected the first transgender mayor of India in Katni. Her candidacy was declared \\"void\\" because she contested in the female category.  In politics  Madhu Kinnar wishes to work as an independent leader, as opposed to joining a political party. Her electoral victory on 4 January 2015, came about nine months after the Supreme Court NALSA verdict, which gave legal recognition to transgender people in India. In the first meeting of the Raigarh Municipal Corporation, Congress and BJP members staged a walkout, resulting in the meeting being postponed. A crucial part of her agenda has been sanitation. In an interview with The Guardian, she states that, \\"‚ÄúThere were no proper sidewalks. The alleys were dirty and piled high with garbage. Poor people, abandoned in their old age, slept in the streets with nothing to keep them warm.

Ur supports a powerful kind of metaprogramming based on row types. Ur/Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for parsing and optimization. Ur/Web supports construction of dynamic web applications backed by SQL databases. The signature of the standard library is such that well-typed Ur/Web programs \\"don't go wrong\\" in a very broad sense. Not only do they not crash during particular page generations, but they also may not: * Suffer from any kinds of code injection attacks * Return invalid HTML * Contain dead intra-application links * Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers * Include client-side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the \\"AJAX\\"-style services that the remote web server provides * Attempt invalid SQL queries * Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between browsers and web servers This type safety is just the foundation of the Ur/Web methodology. It is also possible to use metaprogramming to build significant application pieces by analysis of type structure. The Ur/Web compiler also produces very efficient object code that does not use garbage collection. The implementation of all this is open source. SQL syntax templates embedded in the language facilitate the handling of tables. Although the syntax is based on Standard ML the language includes concepts from Haskell with additional type manipulation. Ajax call/response is serialized through a monad called transaction (corresponds to Haskell's IO) and its marshalling and decoding is encapsulated in the rpc function. The browser client side includes functional reactive programming facilities using the \`(source a)\` type and a signal monad.

Biography  Sergey Nikolayevich Kravkov was born on 23 November 1894 in Saint Petersburg into the family of a prominent Russian pharmacologist Nikolai Kravkov (1865‚Äì1924) and his wife Olga Yevstafyevna, n√©e Bogdanovskaya (1868‚Äì1942), daughter of an outstanding Russian surgeon Yevstafi Bogdanovsky. He spent his childhood with his parents in Germany and Austria-Hungary, and after their separation in 1898 lived with his mother in Odessa. In 1909‚Äì1914 Kravkov studied at the Sea Cadet Corps in Saint Petersburg. After graduation he was made a midshipmen. During World War I Kravkov served in the Black Sea Fleet. In the battle of Cape Sarych on 18 November 1914 against German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau he adjusted the artillery fire of the battleship Tri Sviatitelia. During the battle Kravkov made sketches in water color, published in the magazine ‚ÄúMorskoi sbornik‚Äù (issue no 11 of 1915). In 1917 Lieutenant Kravkov completed navigation courses in Sevastopol and obtained the rank of Navigator First Class. In 1918 he was transferred to the Odessa Hydrographic Department. In November 1919 he set out from Odessa to Vladivostok on the transport ship Iyerusalim. In Vladivostok he sided with the Red Army. During the Japanese intervention in Siberia he went underground. In October 1922 Kravkov was appointed Flag Officer Navigator at the Far East Navy Headquarters. Following its reorganization in 1923 he was sent to Omsk to the Board of Security of Navigation in the Kara Sea (Ubekosibir). In 1923‚Äì1926 Kravkov explored the polar seas as part of the Ubekosibir expeditions. In 1930 he obtained a diploma as a deep sea navigator. In 1930‚Äì1932 he carried out hydrographic work in the Taz Estuary and the Gulf of Ob. He made sketches for the first pilot chart of the Gulf of Ob. After 1932 Kravkov specializined in astronomic work on the Northern Sea Route. His astronomical points in the Minina Skerries, Khalmyer Bay (Gydanskaya Guba), and on the East Siberian sea coast long formed the basis of the maps of those areas. In the intervals between his navigation work Sergey Kravkov taught a shipbuilding course at the Omsk Water College. He was also in charge of a hydrometric station on the Irtysh waterway. During supervision of the delta of the Lena in winter 1940 Kravkov had his feet and hands severely frostbitten. He was sent to Tiksi settlement hospital. The doctors saved his life, but his hands and feet had to be amputated. Being an invalid, Sergey Kravkov moved to Leningrad where his mother and sister lived. From April to October 1941 he worked in the archives of the Hydrographic Department of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route (Glavsevmorput). Kravkov refused to be evacuated from besieged Leningrad, hoping for its early liberation. He died of malnutrition, together with his mother and sister. in February 1942. Kravkov and his relatives were buried in the Serafimovskoye Cemetery, although the exact location of their grave is unknown.  Honours  Sergey Kravkov's name is borne by one of the biggest of the Mona Islands in the Kara Sea. This name was given to the island in 1933 by the Soviet hydrographer Vsevolod Vorobyev who first measured its exact position. In 1974 a hydrographic vessel ordered by the USSR was launched in Finland. Named Sergey Kravkov, it is currently owned by the Russian Ministry of Transport's Federal State Unitary Enterprise Gidrograficheskoye predpriyatiye. The vessel's port of registration is Arkhangelsk.  Awards  Russian Empire: * Order of Saint Anna 4th Class (1914)  Family  In 1920 Sergey Kravkov married Antonina Aleksandrovna Charayeva, a widow. The family had three stepchildren.

She is the sister of actor Vincent Ebrahim. Early life Ebrahim is the sister of South African-British actor Vincent Ebrahim. Her brother, six years her senior, named Ebrahim after himself. Ebrahim's father worked as a teacher in Woodstock, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, as well as an actor, writer, and director. In the late 1950s, he moved the family to Coventry, England, to work as a stage manager. The family later returned to South Africa. Career Ebrahim has stated that she learned acting \\"on the hoof\\" in Cape Town, working as a stagehand, actor, and other jobs in the theatre. Ebrahim has played the central role of Charmaine Beukes Meintjies on the South African television soap opera 7de Laan since 2000. Ebrahim has performed in theatres and at theatre festivals throughout South Africa, including Suidoosterfees and the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees. At the Klein Karoo festival in 2007, she performed in an Afrikaans-language production of Athol Fugard's play, Boesman en Lena. She received the Kanna Award for Best Actress for her role as Lena. At the 2013 Naledi Theatre Awards, Ebrahim won the award for Best Performance in a Play in a Leading Role (Female) for My Naam/Name is Ellen Pakkies. The play tells the real-life story of a South African woman convicted of killing her drug-addicted son after enduring years of abuse. Ebrahim has also written plays, including Die Ongelooflike Reis van Max en Lola, a two-character work she co-wrote with South African playwright and director Hugo Taljaard. Ebrahim based the play in part on her long-time friendship with South African actor Chris van Niekerk. In the play and in real life, the friendship between a gay white man and a Coloured woman persisted, even through the Apartheid era. Ebrahim has said that during the Apartheid era, Van Niekerk would attend one cinema, while she attended another, and \\"then we'd come together and act stukkies (scenes) out\\". At the Klein Karoo festival in 2016, she performed in Invisible, another play she authored in English and Afrikaans. In Invisible, she portrayed a homeless woman who once was a resident of Cape Town's District Six. Ebrahim has also created a one-woman show about her life, Praat Die Storie Smaak Kry (Let's Spice It Up), which she has performed in Afrikaans and English throughout South Africa as part of National Women's Day celebrations. In July 2019, it was announced that Ebrahim would exit her dual roles of Charmaine and her evil twin sister Vivian because \\"all potential stories around Charmaine and Vivian have been exhausted\\". Ebrahim ended her 19-year run on the show on 24 October 2019. In an interview published in the South African magazine Kuier, Ebrahim stated that she had been forced to leave 7de Laan. She said that she had anticipated her exit for some time, and she disputed the claim that there were no more storylines for her character Charmaine. On 7 November 2019, Ebrahim began a six-week guest appearance role on rival South African soap, Binnelanders. Awards Ebrahim has been nominated for and received several awards for her professional work. * In 2007, Ebrahim won the Kanna Award for Best Actress for her performance in Boesman en Lena at the Klein Karoo arts festival. * In 2008, Ebrahim received the Rapport/City Press Prestige Award for her contributions to the arts. * In 2013, Ebrahim won the Naledi Theatre Award for Best Performance in a Play in a Leading Role (Female) for My Naam/Name is Ellen Pakkies. Controversy Ebrahim drew criticism from racists in early January 2015 after commenting on a Facebook post by white supremacist Sunette Bridges, in which Bridges lied about the alleged number of white farmers murdered committed in 2014 . Bridges also claimed that these alleged attacks/murders were mostly perpetrated by \\"blacks\\" which was both untrue and racist. Ebrahim's comment on Bridge's racist Facebook post stressed the fact that coloured, Indian and black South Africans experienced higher levels of violent crimes on average (with the murder of white farmers or a member of their family's only accounting for 0,3% of all murders recorded in South Africa that year) in the year 2014. Ebrahim also brought to light the racist dogmas upon which the Afrikaaner identity is built and the unwillingness of Afrikaaners to meaningfully atone for the damage they have dealt to South Africa and its people. This prompted significant racist backlash on social media. This racist backlash resulted in many Afrikaaner's proving Ebrahim's point, by making racist remarks directed at the actress. While other Afrikaaner's chose to leverage the advantages granted to them by structural racism by attempting to boycott 7de Laan in an attempt to remind Ebrahim of her place within the hierarchy of white supremacy by depriving her of an income.

They agreed to pool money for a kitty, agreeing to share any prize money later won. Jess subsequently won $6,000 but later refused to share the prize money, claiming that it was merely a social agreement not intended to be enforced the parties. *The court ruled that there was a legally binding contract, and Jess was ordered to share the prize money. The court declared that although social agreements are generally not legally enforceable, they can be legally enforceable under certain circumstances.} In this case, the objective bystander would have thought that, having pooled the entrance fee, it was obvious that any winnings were intended to be shared. Commentary For an agreement to become a contract, there must be intention to create legal relations. The Law of Contract - Treitel Two judicial devices aid a court to decide whether there is intent: * the objective test, & * the rebuttable presumption. The objective test was established in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co, where it was held that any reasonable man who read an advertisement that said the advertiser had \\"deposited ¬£1000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\\" would deem that there was intention to create legally relations (even though, subjectively, the advertiser was a rogue who had no intention of honouring the agreement). The rebuttable presumption varies according to the type of transaction. *In a commercial context, it is presumed that parties have intention to create legal relations.Baker v Jones [1954] 1 WLR 1005 *Family agreements are presumed not to be binding,Balfour v Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571Jones v Padavatton [1969] 1 WLR 328 CA unless it is obvious that a contract was intended.Errington v Errington [1952] 1 KB 290 CABeswick v Beswick [1968] AC 58 HL *Although many authors deem that \\"social agreements\\" are the same as family agreements, Simpkins v Pays and Connell v MIB show that this is NOT the case; in agreements between friends there is effectively no presumption, and the objective test is paramount.

Benjamin married Anne Colthurst on 10 January 1744 at St James Garlickhithe, London. They had nine children, of which only one son and three daughters survived them. The children were: * William Rosewell (born 1744). Known as \\"Billy\\". Admitted to the Middle Temple in 1769. Dead by 1782, leaving one natural-born daughter. * Benjamin Rosewell (born 1745).

Career and associates To comply with the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1728, Benjamin Rosewell would have completed his ‚Äúarticles‚Äù with at least a five-year apprenticeship to a senior attorney. By 1740 he was practicing as an attorney at Ironmonger Street, London. He took on many apprentices over the ensuing years with records showing him at Bassinghall Street (1744‚Äì1748) and Throgmorton Street in 1769. In London Directories for the years 1763 to 1777 he is listed as attorney of 12 Angel Court, Throgmorton Street. From 1778 to 1781 he is listed as Rosewell and Dawes, attorneys, of 12 Angel Court. When he wrote his will in 1782 he described himself as ‚ÄòGentleman of Throgmorton Street and of Clapton in Hackney, Middlesex‚Äô and referred to servants at each location. It is presumed that he resided at Clapton and practiced as an attorney from 12 Angel Court, Throgmorton Street, London. :One who joined the practice as an articled clerk was Weeden Butler (1742‚Äì1823) who was there from 24 December 1757 for a term of six years. When the term expired, Rosewell offered him a partnership. However, Butler declined as he had decided to take holy orders. They remained good friends. :Another was John Alleyne (1748‚Äì1777) who was born in Barbados, educated at Eton College and was articled in 1763. John and Weeden Butler were there at the same time and became close friends. John Alleyne was admitted student of the Middle Temple in 1767, shortly before ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Rosewell, and barrister in 1772. He married Ann Rosewell on 29 May 1768 at St John, Hackney, London. They had four daughters living in 1782. :John Alleyne was a frequent and descriptive letter writer and some of his correspondence with Reverend Weeden Butler and Benjamin Franklin (1706‚Äì1790), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, has been published. Franklin was an intimate friend and mentor to John. With both correspondents John Alleyne refers to his wife as Nancy, this being a diminutive form of Ann. Benjamin Rosewell's practice partner at the time of his death was Edwin Dawes, who was possibly a nephew of Weeden Butler. The house at Angel Court became the office of Messrs. Dawes and Chatfield, Solicitors. Death Benjamin Rosewell made his will on 21 April 1782, in which he provided for his living children and grandchildren, including those natural born. He desired to be buried ‚Äòin my own family vault at Chatham, Kent‚Äô. He expressed much disappointment and frustration with the behaviour of 'my unhappy son Benjamin' and seemed to blame the circumstances on ‚Äòthis vile town‚Äô. He died on 1 June 1782 and was buried in the vault of Reverend Walter Rosewell, his second great grandfather, in the churchyard of St Marys, Chatham, on 10 June 1782. Administration was granted 18 June 1782 on the oaths of Ann Alleyne Widow and Elizabeth Rosewell Spinster, 'executors as long as they remain single and unmarried', and the other executors Reverend Weeden Butler and Edwin Dawes.

The miniseries has 2 episodes. Main roles are performed by Richard Roxburgh, Frances O'Connor and Claire Forlani. Plot By 2020, global warming has increased significantly. Southern Europe has turned into a desert since it stopped raining, and similar events now happen in Northern Europe. Only the United Kingdom and some parts in the United States are unaffected. Furthermore, a global energy crisis exists as fossil fuels are running out. The last known reserves are under seabed under Greenland's glaciers. An American energy company, Halo, has the only licence to drill in Greenland. Professor Thom Archer works at \\"Polar Alliance\\", a government service, whose purpose is to find connections between industrial activities in the Arctic and the melting of its ice. Thom tries to convince the authorities to revoke the licence of Halo. According to Thom the glaciers are melting very fast, and if they disappear the sea water will rise 7 metres, the North Atlantic Current will halt, potentially causing a new ice age in the Northern Hemisphere. Halo admits there is indeed a heating in that area but also claims Thom has no evidence there is a direct connection between the heating and Halo's activities. Therefore the government extends the licence. As Thom's wife & daughter travel to visit his father in the UK for his daughter's birthday, Thom's colleague Peterson finds evidence that Halo's drills are responsible for the melting of the glaciers. Thom travels to Greenland only to find out Peterson was killed, apparently by a polar bear, but later determined to be at Halo's hand. Despite this, Thom finds Peterson's evidence, as a new drill by Halo opens a geothermic source in the seabed. This source melts down all the polar ice in only a few hours. Thom's prediction is now a fact: the northern hemisphere is rapidly covered by an enormous amount of snow and temperature decreases to -22¬∞ Fahrenheit. At Thom's insistence, the British Government advises the population to evacuate to the south, and they dismantle the apparatus of government. Meanwhile, Thom flies to the UK with ex-Halo environmental advocate Sarah Fitch, to rescue his family in a post-apocalyptic London.

After having distinguished themselves at Argonne (Bois de Balante) in December 1914, the regiment was finally dissolved on March 5, 1915, due to Italy's entry in the war and the departure of the majority of the regiment back to their country of origin. Today the Legion in Italy is an association of veterans and people who share the ideals of the Republic Garibaldi.  Creation and different nominations  * On November 5, 1914: the 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment () was created. * On March 5, 1915: dissolution of the regiment. History With the outbreak of World War I in the fall of 1914, Giuseppe Garibaldi II (also known as Peppino Garibaldi) and his four brothers went to England to offer their services. The English refused, so Peppino went to Paris and agreed to accept an Italian unit. With French permission he created the Garibaldi Legion to fight for France. It was enthusiastically joined by members of the Italian Youth Republican Legion, veterans of previous campaigns, Greece and South Africa, Mazzini and trade unionists also joined. Instead of joining the French Army the Paris government insisted that the Garibaldi unit join the French Foreign Legion. The body of Italian volunteers consisted of approximately 2,114 men and 57 officers, of whom half were migrants living in France, and was built into the 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment with the standard uniform of the legionaries, with one small difference, a red shirt the partisans wore under their jacket. The Legion was briefly trained in Montelimar, N√Æmes and Montboucher and then transferred on November 11, 1914 to Mailly, where Lieutenant Colonel Giuseppe Garibaldi II formally took over the command. Used on the front of the Argonne in risky enterprises and bayonet assaults, the Legion on December 26, 1914, fought in Belle Etoile, near Bois de Bolante, a bloody battle from which the volunteers were victorious. Here Peppino was almost killed, while, his brother, Lieut. Bruno Garibaldi died in the charge. When the Italian public found out it enraged them. After Bruno was killed 300,000 people took part in his January 6, 1915 funeral procession. French, British, Russian, Belgian and Serbian ambassadors were in attendance. The second battle of the Legion in Argonne, took place January 5, 1915 Four-de-Paris, where it suffered heavy casualties including another brother of Peppino, Constantino Garibaldi. During Bruno's funeral, news arrived of Constantino's death. On March 6, 1915 the Legion, given the general mobilization in Italy, was dissolved and the IV Regiment marched back to Avignon. All Italian legionnaires were then sent back to Italy to fight against the Austrians. All told from fighting under French command the Garibaldi Legion had 300 dead, 400 injured and a thousand sick. Among the fallen officers December 26, 1914 include: the lieutenant Lamberto Duranti from Ancona; Courtes Chausses ( Lachalade ); Lieutenant Gregory Trombetta from Milan, killed at Bois de Bolante (Lachalade); Lieutenant Paul Muracciole by Gatti-of-Vivarium dead near Le Claon (Lachalade); the lieutenant Pasquale Marino, who died at Bois de Bolante. Among the wounded partisans there was Giuseppe Chiostergi Senigallia, elected deputy in the first parliament of the Italian Republic. Lazare Ponticelli, Italian immigrant in France and volunteer assigned to the Legion Garibaldi, became a French citizen in the 1930s and is remembered in France as le dernier Poilu, the last of the veterans.

Over the years, Hateful Monday has become a pioneer of a new wave of punk-rock in the Lake Geneva region. Their primary influence is hardcore punk from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, such as Bad Religion, NOFX, No Fun At All and Propaghandi. Alkaline Trio and Hot Water Music have also shaped Hateful Mondays sound. Hateful Monday regularly tour throughout Europe and frequently in neighbouring France. In April 2015 the band played six shows in Japan, which marked their first tour outside of Europe.http://hatefulmonday.drupalgardens.com/content/japan-here-we-come History Formation and early years (1998‚Äì2004) Hateful Monday was formed in the suburbs of Geneva, Switzerland, by two school friends, Reverend Seb and Igor Gonzola.http://lemurduson.ch/hateful-monday-crowdfunding-lavenir- musique/ Both were heavily influenced by the new wave of punk rock that was arriving from abroad, and the duo made their debuts with various different lineups. Together with their friends Myriam K.and Mark Sman, they recorded their first demo ‚ÄúDo You Have The Same But In Pants?‚Äù in 2000 and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask Questions‚Äù in 2001. These initial demos allowed Hateful Monday to play their first shows and to begin building their reputation. Mark Sman‚Äôs departure from the band in 2001 shifted the lineup. Reverend Seb switched to bass guitar while continuing with lead vocals, and Greg Laraigne joined the group the same year on second guitar. Further success (2004‚Äì2010) In 2004, Myriam K. left the band and was replaced by M. Fallan as guitarist. The band released the album ‚ÄúTake a Breath‚Äù the same year, and commenced their first European tour. Their popularity amplified with their 2006 album ‚ÄúLast March of the Ignorants‚Äù which was successful in Europe and Japan. The band performed at Paleo Festival in 2006, in front of their largest audience yet.http://yeah.paleo.ch/en/edition/2006 In 2008 the band's next album ‚ÄúHalf A World Away‚Äù was released, receiving good reviews.http://www.skartnak.com/kronik-117-hateful_monday.html Line-up changes and fourth album (2010‚Äì2014) In 2010, the band deliberately modified their sound and recorded a more hardcore EP called ‚ÄúLions and Jackals‚Äù. Following up on this release and previous successes, a Japan tour was scheduled for April 2011. Due to the earthquake in March 2011, this was cancelled indefinitely. In 2011, Charly Cougar of Swiss chaoscore band Elizabeth, was added to the lineup, bringing the band to a quintet. M. Fallan switched to bass, with Reverend Seb concentrating his efforts on vocals. This quintet toured numerous times throughout Europe and Switzerland, until 2012 when Greg Laraigne left in order to pursue his career as a tattoo artist in Canada.

Background In 1971, Ross entered into an agreement to a 5-year lease his 345-acre dairy farm to Henderson, with an option to purchase the farm for $65,000. As leases of 3 years or more are legally required to be registered with the Land Transfer Office, Henderson duly registered the lease, which included the option to purchase. Unfortunately, the LTO standard declaration form, required under the law, was not designed for such a transaction, and later resulted in Henderson to of breached the law by not registering his purchase, making the sale illegal and of no effect. In this background, in 1974 Ross's solicitor wrote to Henderson informing him that the sale of the farm had now come to an end. Henderson filed in court for relief under the Illegal Contracts Act by having the sale agreement validated. Held The Privy Council ruled that as the law did not specifically rule out validation, then validation was possible, and given that the law was enacted to prevent undue aggregation of land, and that this was not an issue here, the court upheld the out of Appeals earlier decision to validate the sale agreement.

It was the band's first release after their supposed disbandment in 2014, and also the first release to not feature vocals from frontman MC Ride, which was a major factor in its mixed-to-positive critical reception. Background Fashion Week was described by the group as a ‚Äúsoundtrack.‚Äù A leaked .zip file was shared via Reddit in late-2014, containing 6 tracks from the album and 2 unreleased tracks, but was initially dismissed by fans as fake.

The album art features an image of artist Sua Yoo, who designed the band's cover art for The Money Store. The large chair in which she's sitting on the cover is located at the Silver Legacy Resort & Casino in Reno, Nevada. Critical reception Fashion Week received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 74, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 5 reviews. Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! suggested the lack of Ride's performances made the album very accessible to new listeners of Death Grips, and Spin critic Dan Weiss, comparing Fashion Week to Ghosts I-IV by Nine Inch Nails, wrote that while the album is fairly linear, it still has the group's \\"astoundingly dark and imaginative sonic palette.\\" The Quietus critic Calum Bradbury-Sparvell described the album as \\"the most vibrant and least menacing collection of tracks Death Grips have released.\\" One recurring criticism of Fashion Week was the absence of MC Ride's vocals, with one reviewer suggesting that the instrumentals \\"stagnate\\" on their own.

It was built from to 1960s. It is also known as Kelvin Grove Military Reserve and Kelvin Grove Training Area. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The Gona Barracks site was established just prior to World War I in the 1910s, for the purpose of military training for specialist units of compulsory militia forces. The site continued to develop and became a Citizens Military Force training complex in the 1950s, and later an Army Reserve recruitment centre. The settlement of Brisbane began in 1825 with the establishment of a penal colony along that part of the Brisbane River that was later to become the town's central business district. Transportation of convicts ceased less than twenty years later in 1842, and Brisbane was opened to free settlement. The town was surveyed, and land to the north and west of Spring Hill, an area of early settlement, was made into park land. West of Victoria Park, the largest of the government reserves, the area now known as Kelvin Grove was cleared, and subdivided and offered for sale by the 1860s. The site that was eventually to become Gona Barracks was listed as Portion 322, Parish of North Brisbane, County of Stanley. On 28 March 1879, Portion 322 was granted by the colonial government to the Brisbane Grammar School as an endowment. The school retained the endowment until 1911, leasing grazing rights to the holding as a means of raising funds for the school. No buildings were thought to have been constructed on the site throughout this period, and the only improvement to the endowment was the construction of a number of fences. In May 1911, the Commonwealth Government acquired the Brisbane Grammar School endowment, and renamed the site the Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve. Acquisition of the property was a response to the need for training facilities for Australia's expanding military forces. Forces of a voluntary nature, supported by a small number of permanent forces, had been in place in most of the Australian colonies by the late nineteenth century. With the Federation of Australia's six colonies on 1 January 1901, defence became the responsibility of the new Commonwealth Government, and a Department of Defence was established in March 1901. The department took over control of the various colonial volunteer forces which, together with 1500 full-time soldiers, numbered almost 30,000. An external report completed in 1909 suggested the volunteer militia forces needed to be increased to number 80,000 soldiers and led to the establishment of the Army's Royal Military College at Duntroon in 1911. The Federal Government's response to the report was to introduce compulsory military training for both men and boys. The bulk of the Army's officers and troops were to serve on a part-time basis in the Australian Military Forces (AMF or militia), attending training one night per week and participating in some weekend camps and an annual encampment. By 1911, some 90,000 men and boys had registered for military training Australia-wide, a number which expanded to over 130,000 two years later. Facilities for training in Brisbane included drill halls in Alice and Adelaide Street Streets in the city, and in Boundary Street in Spring Hill. The increase in numbers placed pressure on these facilities, none of which had room for expansion as each was located in a built-up area. The Department of Defence decided it would solve the problem by swapping the three inner Brisbane drill hall sites with the Queensland Government for more adequate land, specifying that the site be close to a tram line. The Survey Officer of Engineers, Captain Good, identified three possible sites to replace the inner city drill halls. The Grammar School Endowment was favoured in assessments of the sites, and in November 1910 the trustees of the endowment accepted an offer of , and the deed of title for the \\"Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve\\" was transferred to the Commonwealth in May 1911.  Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve  The first buildings to be constructed on the Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve were an Infantry drill hall, consisting of a large drill space with eight offices along one side of the building, an associated toilet building, and an artificers workshop for Army mechanics, completed in 1914. This began an era of intense building activity at the site, precipitated by Australia's entry into World War I in August 1914. To enable the construction of further buildings, the site had to be made level, an activity costing over . By October 1915, the levelling had been finished, and another building, the Engineer's depot, had been added to the site. This two-storey timber building was rectangular in shape, and was constructed to the design of Queensland Public Works Department architects. This building was completed at a cost of just over for the 23rd and 15th Engineer Companies, and included two wagon sheds and two harness rooms. An Artillery drill hall, Brigade office and two gun parks for the Artillery units were the next additions to the site, constructed at the end of 1915. The Artillery drill hall was a rectangular, single-storey building with offices and wagon sheds at each end of a centrally located drill hall. The Brigade hall was a two-storey building, located to the west of the drill hall. The two gun park buildings were built at right angles to the Brigade hall, along the Kelvin Grove Road alignment. Each of the buildings featured a large room for the storage of 13 pounder artillery pieces, harness and cleaning rooms, and an office and commanding officer's room. These artillery buildings were designed by the Queensland branch of the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs, and are among the earliest Commonwealth designs in Queensland. Most Commonwealth buildings at this time were being designed and constructed by the various state's public works departments as it was some time before the Commonwealth established its own department with its own employees. A drill hall for the Australian Army Service Corps (AASC) was added at the same time the Artillery buildings were constructed. This hall was built near the 1914 drill hall, at the opposite end of the site from the Artillery drill hall. The single-storey timber building was constructed to the plans of Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs architects, whose drawings were more detailed copies of plans prepared by the Queensland Government. Some other ancillary buildings were added to the Kelvin Grove site by the end of World War I. These included a military laundry with an attached engine house, and a \\"disinfector\\" building. The First World War came to an end on 11 November 1918, and Australian troops returned home. Despite a lack of interest in matters military among the Australian government and people, military training continued at Kelvin Grove throughout the 1920s. By 1921, the Kelvin Grove site had become the training centre for the AASC, Signallers, Engineers and Artillerymen. The reserve was also used by the 11th Mixed Brigade for large training exercises, to which the specialist units based at Kelvin Grove were attached. On one occasion in 1923, the Kelvin Grove Engineers, Artillery, Signals and AASC units, together with Infantry, Australian Light Horse and Australian Army Medical Corps from elsewhere, combined for a training exercise at the site. The use of some of the Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve buildings changed during the 1920s. The AASC moved out of its drill hall, which thereafter became ordnance offices and stores, while one of the gun parks was converted to an ordnance store, and the 1914 drill hall was converted to an ordnance lecture room. The interwar period from 1919 to 1939 was an era of gradual expansion on the Reserve site. The first building to be constructed after the war was a corrugated iron remount depot. This building was dismantled and re-erected in 1933, and together with two riding yards and a manure pit, became the riding school. Many of the subsequent buildings to appear on the site throughout the Depression years of the 1930s were structures relocated from other locations. In 1934, the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) drill hall was relocated to Kelvin Grove from Toowong, at a cost of . The hall was located on sloping land near the AASC drill hall at the southern end of the site. It was positioned on reinforced concrete stumps and converted into a two-storey building. A Belgian gun, captured from the Germans at Pozi√®res in France during World War I by the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, was mounted on the grass outside the building. Living quarters for an Army staff officer were also added in 1934. The three bedroom timber house was constructed along Sylvan Road by builders NT Stansfield and Thomas Foster at a quoted price of . The following year, a Field Artillery officer's mess was constructed between the Artillery drill hall and brigade office, thereby converting the two separate buildings into a single structure. The Frank Moran Memorial Hall was another building to be added to the Kelvin Grove site in the interwar period. Frank Moran was a cadet officer prior to World War I, involved the training of Brisbane Grammar School military cadets. When Australia entered the war, Moran enlisted in the 1st AIF and left Australia in November 1914. He fought at Gallipoli and died of wounds on board ship in August 1915. The Hall was one of three memorials erected in his memory, the others being a Memorial Cross at St Brigid's Catholic Church in Red Hill (dismantled in the 1930s); and a stained glass window in the Brisbane Grammar School War Memorial Library. Capital for the construction of the hall came from funds raised by Moran in 1913 and 1914, intended for the construction of a recreation building for cadets at Red Hill. Some were raised, but lay forgotten until 1920. In 1925, the trustees of the fund decided to donate the money to the Army, provided the funds were used in a project that reflected the intentions of Moran more than ten years earlier. The following March, it was proposed the money be used for the construction of a recreation hut at Kelvin Grove which was to bear Moran's name. The Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways prepared plans for the Frank Moran Memorial Hall in 1928, and in November 1929 the hall was completed at a cost of . The simple timber building was sited between the AASC drill hall and the 1914 Infantry drill hall. Left-over funds were used to purchase furniture, and a bathroom extension was added in 1933. In 1937 ownership and control of the hall was signed over to the Defence Department. Throughout the interwar period, the northern portion of the Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve, the \\"lower barracks\\", remained undeveloped by the Defence Department, who leased the land to private individuals for grazing purposes from the 1920s. The department resumed control of this area for the riding school in late 1934. As the 1930s progressed, it became increasingly evident that another war was approaching. In February 1938 further additions were made to the site following a reorganisation of the existing buildings. The Engineers had moved from their 1915 depot building to the relocated Toowong drill hall, and the Army Signals Corps moved into the former Engineer's depot, renamed the Kelvin Grove Signals Corps depot. The southern side of the building was extended with a two-storey wing, positioned at right angles to the original structure. This area housed a drill space and various stores and messes. In May 1939, the original 1914 drill hall was also altered with the construction of a skillion-roofed extension to the north. A fire hut was relocated to the rear of this drill hall. The Queensland 61st (Infantry) Battalion occupied the building at this time. Finally, in May 1939, a new lavatory block featuring a female toilet was erected under the Signals Corps depot; a closet building behind the AASC building was converted into a cookhouse; and a wireless hut located to the north of the Signals Corps depot, and a combined social and lecture hall were added to the Reserve.  World War II  Army barracks at Kelvin Grove, Brisbane during WWII Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 with a declaration of war on Germany. Within the month of September, the 5th Field Artillery Regiment; the 42nd and 43rd Artillery Batteries; the 105th and 111th Artillery Batteries; and the first motor transport for the Batteries' 18 pounder guns and howitzers, had assembled at the site. The militia troops from the Signals Corps, the RAE and the AASC were also located at the Kelvin Grove Mobilisation Stores, and the 9/49th Signals Unit and the 61st Battalion were operating out of the 1914 infantry drill hall. During World War II there were two permanent additions to the Kelvin Grove site. One was a garage and workshops building for servicing AASC vehicles, made necessary by the Army's process of converting from horse transport to motorised. Plans for the building were prepared in November 1939 and it is thought construction of the building was completed around 1942. The other permanent construction was the School for Linesmen-in-Training building, a two-storey, timber-framed and sheeted with fibrous cement building, finished by July 1941. The still undeveloped lower barracks area was the location of the building, constructed at a price of by Percy Richard Ayre. The building was constructed for the Postmaster-General's Department, who agreed to train militia forces at the facility. Besides the permanent additions to the barracks site, a number of temporary structures were added to accommodate some of the troops mobilised for the war effort. By the end of the war in 1945, temporary and permanent buildings of various shapes and sizes had spread throughout the Military Reserve. An area of notable development occurred around the staff officers quarters at the lower barracks. Here, 27 buildings formed the 2nd Australian Commander Royal Engineers camp. The buildings were likely to have been standard prefabricated structures of the World War II period, consisting of timber and masonite with fibro sheeting. A sloping dirt road connected the upper and lower barracks areas at this time, as did a long line of steep steps. The US Army were also involved with the Kelvin Grove site during World War II. The parade ground area at the upper barracks site was made level by the US Army, whose alterations created the sunken road that runs past the relocated Toowong drill hall.  Post-war years  The Second World War ended in August 1945, and in the months that followed, Kelvin Grove Military Reserve saw the demobilisation of returning soldiers, and the disposal of surplus stores. In 1947, 48 buildings consisting mainly of the RAE Maintenance Company and Signals Camps in the Lower Barracks area, were designated as surplus to Army requirements and sold. The post-war era was also a period of major reshaping of the Australian Army. The defence force was no longer to consist of a small core of professional offices, supported by a part-time army. To this end, the Australian Regular Army was created in September 1947, in which it was planned to have 19,000 full-time soldiers. The Australian Military Forces (militia) were renamed the Citizens Military Forces (CMF) in 1948, and in 1951 the Commonwealth introduced the National Service Scheme which required all 18-year-old Australian males to register for six months compulsory full-time military training, followed by a period of part- time service. The Kelvin Grove site, which became known as the Kelvin Grove Training Area in 1948, was to be used in the National Service Scheme as a major CMF training centre in Brisbane. In 1952 the Defence Department decided to construct a new CMF complex for the training of Engineers and Signals at the Kelvin Grove site. The complex required many buildings, some of which were new buildings constructed at the site, and others were relocated from elsewhere. In establishing the CMF facility, CMF Engineers dug the initial earthworks, and the old riding school was demolished. Twenty-one World War II era buildings were relocated to the lower barracks area from the Wacol Army Camp, and a weatherboard assembly hall was built for both the Engineers and Signals. The depots for both groups were completed in 1953 and the engineers buildings were painted blue and the Signals buildings painted brown to distinguish between the two Depot areas. Authorisation for sealing the road linking the upper and lower barracks areas was also given in 1953. During the 1950s the School for Linesmen Building became the headquarters of the 5th Cadet Brigade which controlled all the school cadet units located in Brisbane and surrounding districts. The 5th Cadet Brigade remained in the building throughout the 1960s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the upper barracks continued its links with the Artillery. A gun, reported to be from , was located behind the 1915 Engineers depot. The gun was later removed, although the \\"H\\" frame steel base remained. The boundary of the Kelvin Grove training area altered somewhat throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s. In the lower barracks area, two acres were purchased from the Queensland Government in 1953, and in subsequent years, the Army exchanged some of its land for privately owned land to make the Barracks site more symmetrical and to accommodate the expansion of the Signals depot. A portion of a Queensland Government road reserve was also purchased at a cost of in 1961. While the lower barracks area was expanding in this period, the upper barracks area was reduced in size. The laundry site had been privately leased since the 1920s, and in 1954 the building and equipment was sold to the company, Bishops Laundry and Dry Cleaners, and thereby excised from the barracks site.  Gona Barracks  During the 1960s the Australian Army began renaming their barracks sites, drawing on prominent battles for the names. The Kelvin Grove site became \\"Gona Barracks\\", derived from the Battle of Gona, fought between Japanese and Australian troops on the north coast of Papua New Guinea between 16 November and 9 December 1942. The barracks continued to evolve and new military units moved to the site. In 1965 five brick houses were built along Blamey Street at a cost of for use as married quarters. Two of the houses were later removed from Blamey Street, and the remaining three were excised from the barracks site. In 1966 the parade ground area was resealed in order to install two helicopter landing pads, while by the 1980s, a new steel demountable lecture room was constructed where the former riding school once stood. Another building, the 1934 staff officers quarters, was removed and relocated to Witton Barracks at Indooroopilly in 1974. In the 1970s portions of army land were acquired by the Main Roads Department for various road works adjoining the site, while another portion was sold and became part of the Kelvin Grove Campus of Queensland University of Technology. In recent years, Army recruitment in south-east Queensland became centred at the Gona Barracks site. Over the years, the use of many buildings changed and alterations to the buildings were made, especially in the upper barracks area. The former Artillery drill hall, former Engineers depot and the former AASC drill hall have been particularly altered internally. In October 1998, following a period of scaling down of activity at the site, Gona Barracks officially closed. Units based at the barracks were dispersed to other Army bases, the museum shifted to Enoggera and a war memorial flagpole sent out to the Royal Australian Regiment Memorial Walk and Contemplation Building at Enoggera. Kelvin Grove Urban Village Kelvin Grove Urban Village sign, 2008 The Queensland Department of Housing purchased the Gona Barracks site in 2000 for $7,000,000. Queensland University of Technology operated its Kelvin Grove campus (formerly the campus of the Brisbane College of Advanced Education and other predecessor institutions) on an adjacent site and desired to expand their campus. Brisbane City Council which controlled adjacent parkland wanted to develop a Local Area Plan that would maximise opportunities for such a large site so close to the Brisbane CBD. Difficulties associated with any redevelopment included steep slopes and contaminated land. A heritage assessment of the Gona Barracks site determined that it was the buildings of the upper barracks around the parade ground that, as a group, were of a greatest significance. A partnership between the Queensland Department of Housing, Brisbane City Council and the Queensland University of Technology was formed to develop a mixed-use urban village precinct using the Gona Barracks site and adjacent land. The university built its Creative Industries precinct re-using Gona Barracks buildings and introducing new buildings, sited to reinforce the rectangular form of the Gona barracks parade ground. The re- development won major planning and design awards from the Urban Development Institute of Australia.  Description  Gona Barracks occupies a site of almost seven hectares in the inner northern Brisbane suburb of Kelvin Grove. The complex comprises approximately 70 individual buildings, located in two fairly evenly divided areas known as the \\"upper barracks\\", accessed via Kelvin Grove Road, and the \\"lower barracks\\" entered from Sylvan Road. The upper barracks area features an expansive central parade ground area, around which a group of buildings is arranged. The lower barracks feature two main groups of buildings set within grassed and bituminised areas.  Upper Barracks   Gun Park Shed 1  The upper barracks area contains two gun park sheds. The first of these is located to the north west of the Kelvin Grove Road entry to the site. The building is a long single-storey timber structure, set on a concrete base, with a gabled roof sheeted in corrugated steel. Original timber doors to the elevation facing the parade ground have been replaced with roller and tilting metal doors. The end rooms contain their original doors and windows. A series of horse-hitching rails are located along the length of the western side of this building.  Gun Park Shed 2  The second gun park shed located on the barracks site mirrors the other gun park shed in construction materials and design. It also contains some early VJ timber linings and early room divisions, although the main gun park space has been subdivided. A ceramic drinking fountain situated on the edge of the parade ground outside this building may be original to its construction. This shed also features a series of horse hitching rails on the western elevation.  Artificers workshop (store)  West of gun park shed 2 is the artificers workshop. It is a small single-storey building on a concrete base with a timber frame clad in ribbed steel sheeting with a gabled roof sheeted in the same material. Internally, the building has two main rooms, one set at a slightly lower level than the other. The building may have been built in two stages. One section appears to be of early construction, and modern cladding has been applied to the outside. This building has been extensively reworked over the years.  Storeroom  Adjacent to the artificers workshop. on the western extreme of the site, is a s storeroom. It is a small single-storey building constructed of a timber frame with part-height corrugated iron sheeting roughly applied, and steel mesh to the upper portions with an earth floor. The shallow-pitch gabled roof is sheeted with corrugated iron. A timber door is centrally located.  Artillery Drill Hall (Admin)  The 1915 Artillery drill hall is positioned at right angles to the number 2 gun park shed, on a north-east ‚Äì south-west axis, near the western boundary of the site. The building addresses the central parade ground area. The hall is a long, predominantly single-storey building constructed of timber weatherboards, with a two-storey section at the western end, reflecting its original construction as two separate buildings. Roofs to both buildings are gabled and sheeted with corrugated steel. The two-storey section of the building to the west features original flanking single-storey wings. Some original timber double doors on the ground floor of this building remain, while weatherboards and roller doors have been inserted where other timber double doors once existed. One of two original flights of stairs to the building remain. The lecture room on the first floor exists in its original configuration. In the eastern section of the building, some original timber double doors are infilled with weatherboards, louvre windows and single doors. To the northern elevation, aluminium framed windows and doors are positioned in many original door openings. Internally, there are a number of original VJ walls and ceiling linings, while the large central hall has a more recent suspended ceiling. The hall is subdivided into two smaller areas, one of which is further subdivided by part-height partitions.  Sanitation, ablutions and latrine blocks  Two sanitation, ablutions and latrine blocks are located to the north-east of the Artillery drill hall. The block closest the hall is currently a female toilet, and appears to have been constructed as an earth closet in association with the Artillery drill hall. It is a small single-storey weatherboard building sitting on a concrete base, with a gabled roof sheeted in corrugated iron. A corrugated iron screen shields the entrance to the toilet from the parade ground. The neighbouring circa World War II toilet block is a small single-storey structure, clad in weatherboards on a concrete base, with a skillion roof sheeted in corrugated steel. It appears to have been built on the site of an earlier wireless hut. To the north of the ablution blocks are two s buildings, an armoury and lecture room. The armoury is a small single-storey masonry building on a concrete base sheeted in corrugated steel and skillion roof. The lecture room is a portable metal-clad building set on low stumps.  Engineer's (RAE) depot (admin)  The 1915 Engineer's (RAE) depot is located east of the Artillery drill hall, and sits at right angles to this building. It is a two-storey timber framed weatherboard building with an additional two-storey wing at the southern end constructed at right angles to the original building. The gabled roof is sheeted with corrugated steel. Access to the building from the parade ground is gained to the upper floor via four bridges. The site drops away dramatically around this building and to the east access to the building is made to the lower floor. Internally, full-height partitions divide the central space, creating individual offices, while the lower floor features messes. Early VJ linings to the perimeter walls on the upper level exist, while the lower level has mostly recent linings and finishes although the timber post and beam structure remains visible. A face brick wall lines a large part of the lower level on the parade ground side. An original timber door to the waggon shed on the lower level exist, while timber infill and new doors and windows are in place where other timber doors were once located. The later wing contains several rooms on the upper level and a large modern kitchen below. A tennis court is located to the east of the Engineer's depot, and a flagpole is located in the parade ground area to the west.  Parade ground structures  The central parade ground area is located to the south of the structures noted above. It is a bitumenised area with storage compounds and small shelter sheds located on its eastern elevation. The most substantial structure in this area is a s single-storey building set on a concrete base covered with steel sheeting, comprising seven bays with roller shutters.  Toowong drill hall (admin)  The 1915 Toowong drill hall is located to the east of the central parade ground area. The hall is a large timber framed building sheeted in corrugated iron. It sits on concrete stumps and bearers with infill of corrugated iron sheeting, forming a basement level. South of the Toowong drill hall is a s armoury. It is a single-storey building on a concrete base sheeted with corrugated steel, with a skillion roof. This building is not of cultural heritage significance.  Australian Army Service Corps (AASC) drill hall  The AASC drill hall is located south of the Toowong drill hall, in the eastern corner of the upper barracks site. It is a long single-storey timber building set on a concrete base. A centrally located double-storey height section is flanked by lower, single-storey wings. The gabled roof is sheeted with corrugated steel. Some original windows and doors survive, while others have been replaced with steel tilting doors. The building also features aluminium awnings. Internally, the original drill room space contains a series of offices with part height partitioning and suspended ceilings. Some early VJ timber partitions and linings remain and the timber roof trusses exist above the suspended ceilings. The eastern end of the building contains a bar and mess area. To the rear of the AASC drill hall, on the south-western corner of the building, is a timber toilet block set on a concrete base, with a skillion roof sheeted with corrugated iron. It is joined to the drill hall via an attached shower block. A s toilet block, and s shelter are also located to the rear of the AASC drill, at the eastern end of the building. These structures are not of cultural heritage significance.  Frank Moran Memorial Hall  The Frank Moran Memorial Hall is located south- west of the AASC drill hall. It is a single-storey timber building sited on low concrete stumps, with a gabled roof sheeted with corrugated steel. A skillion roofed addition is located to the rear of the building to the south. The interior features VJ timber walls and original ceiling lining. Located adjacent to the memorial hall is a concrete slab which originally supported a post World War II petrol, oil and lubricant store.  Infantry drill hall  The 1914 Infantry drill hall is located in the southern corner of the upper barracks site. It is a large single-storey building, timber framed and sheeted in corrugated iron, with a gabled roof also sheeted in corrugated iron. The building has a concrete floor that is not original. A 1939 skillion roofed addition is located to the northern end of the building, and another addition exists to the south. Internally, most of the drill room space is intact with exposed roofing. There are offices with original timber linings and doors, located along the western elevation. On the south-western corner of the building is a 1914 latrine building. It is a small timber framed building sheeted with corrugated iron, and has a simple gable roof with a skillion attached and sits on a concrete base. A 1930s fire hut is also sited on this corner of the drill hall. It is a single-storey building on a concrete base, timber framed and sheeted in corrugated iron with a corrugated iron roof.* A small metal-clad storage shed built on a concrete base is located to the west of the drill hall, along the property boundary on Kelvin Grove Road. This structure is not of cultural heritage significance.  Garage and workshop  The 1941-42 garage and workshop building is sited adjacent to the Infantry drill hall, along the western elevation of the central parade area. It is a large single-storey building set on a concrete base, sheeted and roofed in corrugated iron. The roof has a saw-tooth profile. Internally, the building is divided into various rooms, some with suspended ceilings. The steel structure remains and is visible through most of the building. Three small structures are located north-west of the garage and workshop. One is a s bowser store, consisting of a timber frame supporting a corrugated iron roof, sheltering two petrol bowsers. Another is a s-60s small single-storey storeroom set on a concrete base, timber framed and sheeted with corrugated iron, with a gabled, corrugated iron roof. The third building is a s latrine. It is a demountable or pre-fabricated type amenities block and is not of cultural heritage significance.  Army Research recruiting component  This building is located on the western side of the main entry to the site from Kelvin Grove Road. The s structure is a single-storey timber building on low concrete and steel stumps. The building has a gabled roof sheeted in corrugated iron. Two building wings extend to the east and west of the main part of the structure. Internally, the building comprises a number of rooms to the north and a large room to the east. Opening off this large room is a kitchen containing some early windows and doors. Other windows are of more recent installation, as are wall linings, ceilings and floor coverings. The building has early loft storage areas accessed by ladder at each end of the main section. A flagpole is located to the north of this building, in the centre of the main entry to the site.  Lower barracks  The lower barracks area is located to the north-east of the upper barracks area. A driveway joining the two barracks areas runs from the north-western elevation of the Engineers' depot to the eastern elevation of the Quartermasters store in the lower barracks area. External access to the lower barracks area is gained via Blamey Street and Kelvin Grove Road, through the upper barracks. The area developed for Engineers is located in the northern portion of the lower barracks, while the area for Signals is positioned in the southern portion of the site. The Engineers area is reached immediately upon entering the lower barracks from Blamey Street. A group of seven buildings are loosely organised around a bitumen area, and include administration buildings, a bridging store, an armoury and quartermasters store, an RAE training assembly hall and a 1970s prefabricated lecture room. The bridging store is a timber- framed shed building, while the other structures in the Engineers area are timber or steel framed buildings, set on concrete stumps and featuring weatherboard cladding and corrugated iron or steel roofs. The Engineers buildings are a mixture of structures built both on-site, and relocated from Wacol Army Barracks in 1953. South of the Engineers area is a group of buildings established in an \\"L\\" configuration around a bitumen area for Signals men and women. Some of the structures, including a battery room, Signals Corps Area Assembly Hall, a latrine, an administration building, a lecture room and a s shelter shed were constructed on-site, while other administration buildings, a canteen and a surgery were relocated to the site from the Wacol Army Barracks in 1953. The buildings are generally timber or steel framed with weatherboard cladding and corrugated iron and steel roofs, set on concrete stumps. The 1970s shelter shed is a concrete block building. Located between the Engineers and Signals areas, on the eastern border of the site, is the PMG School for Linesmen in Training building. It is a two-storey timber-framed building sheeted in fibrous cement panelling. s \\"wash point\\" is cited south of the School for Linesmen building, across a roadway and open area. It is a concrete parking area with storage sheds at one end used for the washing down of vehicles.  Landscape  The Gona Barracks site contains a variety of trees and shrubs, endemic, planted and self-seeded, that have developed over time with the development of the site. The trees can be broadly classified according to the period of planting as indicated by their size, species and location.  Vegetation which predates army occupation  One Ficus platypoda along the Kelvin Grove alignment appears to be the only remnant vegetation on site.  Interwar vegetation  A significant stand of stately Jacaranda acutifolia and Grevillea robusta trees planted as an avenue along the roadway between the Engineers' depot and the Toowong drill hall in the upper barracks area, forms the most significant stand of vegetation on the site. It appears the embankment and roadway on which these trees stand was in existence by 1925. Within this group are a number of Phytolacca dioica which are possibly of a similar age.  Postwar vegetation  A group of assorted trees including exotic species and some Queensland rainforest trees are to be found on the embankment below the parade ground area.  Self-sown trees  Numerous isolated trees have seeded themselves throughout the site and in particular on batters created during earthworks in the 1920s on the upper barracks and in 1953 on the lower barracks. Several isolated Ficus platypoda occur is scattered locations on the lower barracks. These specimens are of a moderate size and may have self-sown, planted or may be remnant.  Heritage listing  Gona Barracks was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Gona Barracks is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as evidence of Queensland's preparations for military involvement in various world conflicts. Specifically, Gona Barracks is associated with the expansion of military training for militia forces after the introduction of compulsory military training in 1911, the provision of facilities for specialist militia units, and the continuation of voluntary military forces until 1998. The place contains World War I drill halls built for militia units of infantry, and more specialised groups such as the artillery, engineers and service corps, and as such demonstrates the extent of the various sections of the armed forces at the time and the commitment of the citizen soldiers who composed these units. The general size of the barracks site also demonstrates the site's early history as the Brisbane Grammar School endowment, from 1879 to 1911. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The World War I era buildings in the upper barracks area of Gona Barracks demonstrate rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage as a surviving precinct of buildings from this period, and as examples of the early design of buildings by the Commonwealth. The concentration of drill halls, and the number of different types of drill halls for the various services sited at one location was not a common military practice at the time. The gun park, services, artillery and engineers drill halls are rare surviving examples of their type. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Gona Barracks has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history as the World War I buildings in the upper barracks demonstrate the development of military technology. The buildings constructed for the artillery, service corps and engineers demonstrate in their form and room layouts the important role played by horses in military activity at that time, which was later supersede by motorised transportation. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Gona Barracks is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places, as the layout of the World War I buildings illustrate the military use of the site. This group of buildings was carefully and deliberately placed around a central parade ground area, a practice which was followed in other parts of Australia. The World War II buildings also demonstrate the principal characteristics of this type of building, constructed of timber with corrugated iron roofs, elevated on low stumps. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Gona Barracks is important because of its aesthetic significance. The World War I buildings in the upper barracks area are of aesthetic significance as a group of similarly scaled buildings constructed of timber, positioned around a central open space or parade ground area. These qualities are enhanced by the overall intactness of the exteriors of most of these buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Gona Barracks has a special association with a substantial part of Queensland's military community. As a military training ground since the early years of World War I until 1998, thousands of servicemen and women have an association with the site which has played an active role during the major periods of defence organisation in this country. In more recent years, it has functioned as an Army recruiting centre, particularly for the Army Reserve who were based at the site.

The 1983 coup ousted the democratic government of Shehu Shagari while the July 1966 coup ousted the military government of General Ironsi. Bako was killed while attempting to arrest President Shehu Shagari during the December 1983 coup d'√©tat. Career Ibrahim Bako was commissioned into the Nigerian Army in 1963 as a Lieutenant after graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Bako (then a Lt Colonel) served as a logistics officer on the National Census Board for the 1973 census. At a point in his career, Ibrahim Bako led the Nigerian Army contingent that facilitated the transfer of about 100 former guerrillas from the Zimbabwean bushes (after the liberation struggle) for selection and training at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna in 1980. Those 100 former guerrillas formed the pioneer corp of the post-independence Zimbabwe National Army. As of December 31, 1983, Bako was Director of the Army Faculty at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, and acting GOC 1 Mechanised Division, Kaduna. Role in July 28, 1966 coup The July 28, 1966 mutiny (often called the Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966) was a violent overthrow of General Aguiyi-Ironsi's military government, which came into power after the abortive January 15 coup, spearheaded by Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Lt Col Kaduna Nzeogwu. A group of military officers of northern Nigerian origin (including then Lts Ibrahim Bako, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, Theophilus Danjuma, Captain Joe Garba, Lt Col Murtala Muhammed, among others) conspired and mutinied against General Ironsi's military government. Among the casualties of the mutiny were General Aguiyi Ironsi and Lt Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi. During reconnaissance for the counter coup, then Lt Col Murtala Mohammed would drive to Ibadan (where Bako was stationed along with others like then Lt Jerry Useni), Muhammed would often drive into town from Lagos, pick up Ibrahim Bako and Abdullai Shelleng at a pre-arranged location and drive around without stopping while they discussed their counter-coup plan. Role in December 31, 1983 coup Ibrahim Bako (then Director of the Army Faculty at the Armed Forces Command and staff College, Jaji) and acting GOC 1 Mechanised Division, Kaduna, was tasked by the coup conspirators with arresting President Shehu Shagari presumably after Shagari's Brigade of Guards had been neutralized (without violence as planned) by Col Tunde Ogbeha. Author Max Siollun notes that Bako was chosen for the arresting role because Bako's father was a personal friend to Shagari. Unknown to Bako was the fact that the coup plot had been leaked to President Shagari, whose guards were on high alert. After arriving at the Presidential residence (in non-military attire) with an armed detachment to arrest the President, Bako was shot dead while sitting in the passenger side of a Unimog utility truck in an ensuing firefight between troops from Bako's detachment and the Brigade of Guards soldiers under the command of Captain Augustine Anyogo. The Unimog utility truck that Bako was killed in is on display at the Nigerian Army Museum in Zaria, Nigeria. The senior military officers involved in the 1983 coup were: *Major General Muhammadu Buhari (General Officer Commanding, 3rd Armored Division, Jos) *Major General Ibrahim Babangida (Director of Army Staff Duties and Plans) *Brigadier Ibrahim Bako (Brigade Commander) *Brigadier Sani Abacha (Commander, 9th Mechanized Brigade) *Brigadier Tunde Idiagbon (Military Secretary, Army) *Lt Colonel Aliyu Mohammed (Director of Military Intelligence) *Lt Colonel Halilu Akilu *Lt Colonel David Mark *Lt Colonel Tunde Ogbeha *Major Sambo Dasuki (Military Assistant to the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Wushishi) *Major Abdulmumuni Aminu *Major Lawan Gwadabe *Major Mustapha Jokolo (Senior Instructor, Basawa Barracks - Zaria) *Major Abubakar Umar Major General Buhari's Supreme Military Council (SMC) observed a minute of silence for the slain Brigadier Bako during SMC's first meeting. Conflicting accounts of Bako's death during the December 31, 1983 coup Bako's son (Professor Ibrahim Ado Bako) claimed in a January 2014 interview with Leadership of Nigeria, that Bako was killed by fellow coup conspirators who were not aligned with Bako's intention to conduct a bloodless coup. Professor Bako asserted that the \\"top brass of the army and their cohorts did not agree with what he (my father) wanted to do because they wanted the coup to be bloody. They now ordered a Lt. Col to shoot him and he died instantly on the scene at the present Area 1 bridge side in Abuja\\".

Early life   Military career  Roland de Vries joined the South African Army in January 1964, qualified as an officer in January 1964 and retired as the Deputy Chief of the South African Army in April 1999. He served in various training and operational positions. Command He commanded amongst others, 61 Mechanised Battalion Group, the South African Army College, 7 South African Infantry Division and the Joint Training Division of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Operations His operational experience included various military operations in the former Rhodesia, South West Africa (Namibia) and Southern Angola. Some of these were Operation Protea (1981), Moduler (1987) and Prone (1988) in Southern Angola.

His book on mobile warfare, Mobile Warfare ‚Äì a perspective for Southern Africa, was published during August 1987 in South Africa, while he was a colonel. This book outlined his thinking on the development of operational concepts and military doctrine for mobile conventional warfare within the Southern African context. He is credited with being the main driver behind these concepts within the South African Army. With the SANDF Gen de Vries led the Transformation Team of the newly created South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in 1997 in developing a new integrated Leadership, Command and Management Concept for the Department of Defence. In 1997 he was appointed Chief of Joint Training and in 1998 as Deputy Chief of the SA Army. This role entailed developing a new military strategy for the SA Army as well as planning and managing the army's transformation process.

Background Patricia Martin worked for 8 1/2 years as a librarian at the Lower Hutt City Council. Upon her resignation in 1979, her employment contract entitled her to a gratuity of $878.24, a gratuity that was standard practice of the council that had been paying all its departing staff since 1952. Unfortunately for Martin, the year before in 1978, the council became aware that under section 6(2) of the Finance Act (no 2) 1941, only gave local authorities the ability to pay such gratuities if the person had been employed for more than 10 years. The council went to court to resolve this issue, and the District Court validated the gratuity. The council appealed. Held The High Court of New Zealand overturned the validation order, on the basis that to validate was against public policy. Heron J stated \\"I think here there is considerable force in [counsel's] submission that where one is considering ultra vires conduct in respect of a statutory body such as a local body under the Local Government Act and not just an unlawful activity otherwise intra vires, wide considerations of public interest apply\\".

It airs in the Philippines through 666 kHz in Manila with simulcast on TV Natin stations, DZRH provincial relay stations 31 MBC Television Stations Nationwide and DZRH News Television. Since August 31, 2020, it is broadcasting thrice a day with its main edition airing every weekday from 12 to 1 p.m., an evening edition every weeknights (except Wednesdays) at 6:30-7:30 p.m, and a late-night edition at 11:30 pm to midnight. History 2013-2018: as The Network NewsBreak and MBC Network News The newscast was launched in October 2013 at the rebrand of RHTV to DZRH News Television with Samantha Nazario, Bea Oranga and Nino Padilla as an 11:00 AM newscast under the name The Network NewsBreak. They were later replaced with the quartet of main anchor Dennis Antenor, Jr., segment anchors Sonny Casulla, Rocky and primary relief anchor Vien Dacles under the MBC Network News banner in 2014. Initially, Dacles doubled-duty as weather reporter until MBC outsourced weather forecasters from Panahon.TV in 2017. Initially, the newscast aired on weekdays at 11:00 am and Saturdays at 10:30 am on cable as MBC Network News: Special Edition, both having an 11:30 pm audio-only encore on DZRH-AM and running a half-hour until June 16, 2017 when the weekday edition moved to the prime noon slot and expanded to an hour as a part of daytime revamps. However, the Saturday edition wasn't affected until it was axed by November 25 of that same year in favor of expanding the top-of- the-hour bulletin to Saturdays. The cable-exclusive bulletins continued until June 2019. As DZRH Network News On January 8, 2018, coinciding with programming changes on radio, the newscast was reformatted as DZRH Network News and began its simulcast on radio, replacing Rapido Hataw Balita: Alas Dose. Dennis Antenor, Jr. remained at the anchor chair with an expanded involvement from its radio reporters and presenting the headlines with emphasis to a \\"timeline\\" format, wherein each stories carried timepieces depicting the time the news was announced by the station. Network promotional material tagged the newscast as having a different approach from its predecessor. Initially, DZRH-AM simulcast the full hour of the program until March 2018 when it was scaled down to a half-hour to accommodate the radio station's slate of radio dramas; the program itself reduced its run to a half- hour by July 2019. Changes occurred in April 2018 with Vien Dacles and Sonny Casulla (who later retired and transferred to 87.9 Radyo Bi√±an) ending on- camera roles and adding in new segment and relief anchors. In October 2018, Regi Espiritu replaced Antenor, Jr., as the new anchor as the latter concentrated on his duties as continuity announcer and host of Byaheng RH. MBC fire and aftermath On October 2, 2019, the MBC broadcast facilities were affected by a major fire that originated at the Star City Complex, including the studios utilized by DZRH News Television. Upon the station's temporary relocation to the BSA Twin Towers on October 4, the newscast utilized the DZRH radio booth to ensure continuation of the broadcast until new studios for the TV simulcast would be finished. However programming decision opted for the arrangement to become permanent, reducing its format to a straight-forward newscast when DZRH was relocated at the Design Center of the Philippines nearby the MBC Building on November 11, 2019. On January 27, 2020, MBC revived MBC Network News albeit as a spun-off, separate newscast exclusively for DZRH News Television, while DZRH Network News remained on the air on both platforms. The former was anchored by the station's international diplomatic reporter Karen Ow-Yong and aired at 11:30-12:00 noon as a lead in to the latter until March when DZRH expanded news coverage in view of the enhanced community quarantine in response to COVID-19. As a part of adjustments, DZRH Network News re-expanded to an hour-long noontime newscast while MBC Network News moved to a late-evening broadcast. Both editions continued airing under this arrangement until August 28, 2020. 2020: Unified branding On August 31, 2020, MBC Network News was relaunched and returned as DZRH's noontime news program while retiring the \\"DZRH Network News\\" brand. Its original anchor, Dennis Antenor, Jr. returned as the main presenter with Atty. Cherryl Adami-Molina, who formerly served as co-anchor for DZRH Happy Hour in the same capacity. The reformat is as a result of the move of Dos por Dos and its hosts Anthony Taberna and Gerry Baja to DZRH and replacing Happy Hour at the 5:00 pm timeslot. On the same day, MBC Network News expanded to include an evening edition, anchored by Rey Sibayan and DZRH Evening News holdover Raymond Dadpaas at 6:30 pm. The late-night edition was also carried over, but reformatted to concentrate exclusively on provincial reports. Under the current format, the noontime edition is broadcast from the DZRH News Television TV studio as an hour-long newscast on cable with its first half-hour simulcast on radio (similar to its predecessor) while its evening edition is broadcast hour-long on all platforms and produced from the DZRH radio studio. The late-night edition is broadcast on all platforms in full from the RHTV studio.

It is the easternmost monastery from the spectacular 13th-century monastery complex Mala Sveta Gora. The monastery is called ‚ÄúSveti Spas‚Äù (Holy Saviour) after the day of The Ascension of Jesus (Spasovden) (there is no saint with the name of Spas). Location The monastery is located at 5 km south-east from the former village of Dolni Lozen (today the eastern part of Lozen), near Sofia, deep in the bowers of the Lozen Mountain under the Polovrak peak (1182 m), on a natural terrace with views of the Sofia Valley. History Origins The monastery was founded in the 13th century. At the end of the 14th century, when Urvich, Sredets the whole region of Sofia fell under Ottoman rule, the monastery was destroyed. In the 15th and 16th centuries it was abandoned definitively but was restored in the 17th century. Written records, the oldest one from 1671, testify that there was a school in the monastery with a teacher Yakim from Sofia and students from Sofia and the surrounding villages. In 1671-1694 there was a literary and calligraphic school. In 1737 the monastery became a centre of the Uprising of the bishops of Sofia and Samokov. It was quelled in late July and early August 1737. By an order of Ali Pasha Kyupryulyuoglu, some 350 Sofia citizens, priests, monks and people from the surrounding villages were killed, including bishop St. Simeon of Samokov. After the participation of monks in the Uprising, the Monastery of Sveti Spas was destroyed again by the Turks. Revival Front view of the church In 1821 the monastery was restored again on the old foundations. The one-apse, one-nave Church of Holy Ascension was constructed, with dimensions of 7 by 14 meters. Three large domes of the old cylindrical building, built by the master Tsvyatko Todorov from the village of Zhablyano, near the town of Radomir, are still intact today. They were quite unusual for the Bulgarian architecture from that period. From another inscription below, we learn that in 1869 the Samokov painter Nikola Ivanov Obrazopisov with his assistants Hristaki Zahariev Zografsky and Dimitar Hristov Dupnichanin repainted the church and three domes. The frescoes, which are preserved today in relatively good condition, attract pilgrims and visitors with their rich colours and craftsmanship. Another interesting fact connected with mural paintings is that in no other temple in Sofia there were depicted so many Bulgarian saints and historical figures. Along with biblical scenes, Nikola Obrazopisov painted images of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Michael Voin, Bishop Marko, John of Rila, Euthymius of Tarnovo, Onufari of Gabrovo, Constantine of Sofia and the revered by the Bulgarians St. Petka and St. Nedelya. Also interesting are the realistic donor portraits of abbot Kiryak from 1868 and the icon of St. Jovan Vladimir, a Serbian prince married to Kosara, a relative of the Bulgarian emperor Samuel (r. 997‚Äì1014). According to the legends of the local people, the St. Spas Monastery has been a centre of the national liberation movement. Vasil Levski stayed there. After the Liberation in 1878 a school with several large rooms and a separate room for the teacher was constructed next to the monastery. Until 1900 the monastery was male and then was converted into a female abode. Condition of the monastery today Today Lozen monastery houses only two nuns, the novice Christina and the abbess mother Agatha. In recent years, one of the residential wings, the monk cells and the two-storey guest house were restored. One of the pre-existing chapels is being currently reconstructed. On the recently restored church old altar, there can be seen original icons from the period 1850‚Äì1890. The frescoes located in the three domes are also restored. The entire outer western fa√ßade was covered with frescoes, which unfortunately now are almost completely wiped out. The monastery is located in a dense oak forest. In the vicinity there are several springs with cold mountain water. This, and the fact that it is accessible from Dolni Lozen (10 km from Sofia) for about an hour on foot and for 15 minutes by car, make it a preferred place for picnics.

Rubber Duckie was led by technical guitarist Jia starting in the early 2000s, along with (then) drummer Sunny. Rubber Duckie had attained much recognition as a strong female rock group, and had released two singles and a full album. Swings was led by vocal and bassist Haein, along with drummer A-zzang. Swings received much critical acclaim and mainstream popularity when proceeding through several elimination rounds on 'Top Band - Season 2'. Both Rubber Duckie and Swings were featured in episode \\"Breaking Down Our Prejudice\\" of Arirang TV's program \\"Rock on Korea\\" in July 2013. After the Girls' Rock Festival, and much discussion by management of both bands, an agreement was reached to draw talent and form a single new band. Walking After U drew from both bands' previous work, taking strengths and finding a new style. Many songs in the current repertoire still come from one of the previous bands' catalogs.  Touring  After releasing their debut album, WAU toured South Korea extensively. Playing in clubs, bars, coffee shops, and concert venues, the band focused on building a wide fanbase. Following their Korean tour, they briefly toured Japan and Taiwan as well. WAU is maintaining a focus on live shows and building their fan base.

This phenomenon plays an important role in pseudohyponatremia, an error affecting measurements made by either flame photometry or indirect potentiometry but not by direct potentiometry. The volume of total solids (primarily protein and lipid) in a plasma sample is approximately 7%, so that only 93% is water. The main electrolytes are confined to water phase. So for example in 10 ŒºL plasma sample, only 9.3 ŒºL is water that contains the electrolyte. Thus if the concentration of an electrolyte, say Na+ is determined to be 140 mmol/L, it is the concentration in total plasma volume, not in plasma water volume. This phenomenon produces only a slight difference as volume fraction of water in plasma is sufficiently constant. But, in patients with severe endogenous or exogenous hypertriglyceridemia and in patients with high plasma protein concentration (usually due to paraproteinemia), water portion of plasma is replaced with either lipid or protein causing falsely low electrolyte value (pseudohyponatremia). Conversely, in patients with low plasma protein concentration (a finding often seen in critical care), the water content of plasma is higher than normal, resulting in the reciprocal artifact, a falsely high electrolyte value (pseudohypernatremia).

He was born in London and died in South Kensington, also part of London. The son of John Pontifex, a cricket player of the 1820s, Charles Pontifex was educated at King's College School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was often a lower-order batsman and usually a bowler, though he later batted as an opener and it is not always clear, from incomplete records, that he bowled in every game. Equally, it is not known if he hatted right- or left-handed, and nor is his bowling style recorded, though his obituary in The Times states that he bowled left-handed. He made an immediate impact in early matches for the Cambridge side in 1851: in his first game, he took six Cambridge Town Club wickets in the first innings, though the complete record for this game has not survived. He was picked for the University Match against Oxford University and took 10 wickets in the game, which Cambridge won by an innings and four runs. Pontifex was less successful for Cambridge in the 1852 season and was not picked for the University Match, which Oxford won easily. An obituary from 1912 in The Times suggests that he was in poor health that year. After the Cambridge season was over, however, he turned out for amateur teams representing the Gentlemen of the South and the Gentlemen of Kent. He returned to better form in 1853, when he was captain of the university team. In the first first-class game of the season, against the Cambridge Town Club, he opened the batting and scored 32, the highest score of his first-class career; he also took six wickets in the Town Club's first innings. He was not successful as captain in the 1853 University Match, as Oxford again won with an innings to spare. Pontifex graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854 and was called to the bar in the same year. He played in some amateur cricket games after Cambridge, but only three of them, in successive seasons from 1858 and all for the Gentlemen of Kent side, were rated as first-class. In 1872, he was appointed as a puisne judge on the High Court of Bengal in India \\"with every prospect of becoming Chief Justice\\", according to his Times obituary; in the event, a change of government in the UK appointed Richard Garth, also a first-class cricketer, and Pontifex remained on the judges' bench for 10 years. In 1882, he was recalled to London to become a special legal adviser to the Marquess of Hartington, Secretary of State for India and he remained in this post until he retired in 1892, at which point he was knighted. Pontifex married in 1881; his wife was Grace, the widow of Thomas Gribble, formerly postmaster of Bengal, and her son from her first marriage was James Byng Gribble, a champion real tennis player who died in 1902. Lady Pontifex donated the James Byng Gribble Cup to the Gold Medal winner at the Lord's real tennis tournament and was therefore mentioned each year in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's report of Marylebone Cricket Club business until her own death in 1928.

Early life Henr√≠quez's father is from Panama and immigrated to the U.S. in 1971 for college; her mother is from New Jersey and worked in Delaware public schools as a translator. Henr√≠quez was born in Delaware and attended school in the U.S., but spent summers in Panama. She did not speak Spanish as a child and so on visits \\"had no choice but to sit there and observe\\" dynamics she later evoked in her writing, particularly the warmth and joy of family life among her father's relatives. In a New Yorker essay, Henr√≠quez has said \\"the honest-to-goodness and embarrassing story\\" of how her interest in writing began \\"is that I started writing in high school, and I did it for a boy.\\" Uninterested in her frequently-professed affections for him, the boy in question gave her a journal and suggested that she instead write down everything she wanted to tell him and give them to him at the end of a year. She began the journal writing to him, > \\"But it didn't take long before I found I was writing for myself, and for > the sheer enjoyment of the act of writing. I was hooked. I sat down at the > end of each day and scribbled page after page, experimenting with new ways > of saying things, and reveling in a feeling of absolute freedom.\\" Ardor for writing replaced the unrequited affection. \\"As soon as I ran out of space in that journal, I started another, and then another after that. I haven't stopped writing since.\\"  Education  Henr√≠quez attended Northwestern University; she majored in English, graduating in 1999. She then earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. She has described her time in the Iowa program as \\"a great experience\\", highly valuable both for validating her writing as well as developing her skills: \\"I have all my notebooks...and I still open them every once in a while to find something that Chris Offutt said about dialogue or something that Sam Chang said about structure or that Marilynne Robinson said about subordinate clauses. I could not have gotten that specific knowledge anywhere else.\\" At the same time, responding to Junot Diaz's criticism of the \\"unbearable too-whiteness\\" MFA programs, Henr√≠quez notes that while in Iowa, she often spent her own time writing about Panama (which later became the setting for her first two books), but submitted only stories about the United States and American characters to her classes, subsequently wondering whether this choice stemmed from some sense that in the MFA setting, the stories on Panama \\"weren't going to be as acceptable, or that maybe they were going to be taken in a different way than the stories that were set in the United States and that I was trying in a way to inoculate myself.\\" Career Henr√≠quez's fiction has appeared in various literary magazines. In 2006 she published in The New Yorker.  Books  Her first book was a collection called Come Together, Fall Apart. Containing eight short stories and a novella, Come Together, Fall Apart was published on April 4, 2006 by Riverhead. Reviewing the collection in The New York Times, Thomas Beller said, \\"Henr√≠quez's fiction provides intense close-ups of young Panamanians whose lives are in enormous flux...Always she appears to be probing for rare moments of grace.\\" Her debut novel, The World in Half, was published by Riverhead three years later, April 16, 2009. The novel follows a young woman from Chicago who takes a trip to Panama to pursue family ties there. In The Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley described the book as an \\"engaging if slight first novel...sure to strike a familiar and affecting note with the many other residents of this country who are trying to reconcile divided identities as well as divided loyalties.\\" The Book of Unknown Americans, Henr√≠quez's second novel, was published in 2014 with Knopf.

He was the brother of Arthur O'Connor and the father of Feargus O'Connor and Francisco Burdett O'Connor. Early life O'Connor was born in Connorville, County Cork, into an Irish Protestant family.James Dunkerley, Americana: The Americas in the World Around 1850, Verso, 2000, pp.449-50. He studied law and was called to the bar in 1784. He married Louisa Anna Strachan, who died after giving birth to two children, Louise and Roderic.James Dunkerley, \\"The Third Man: Francisco Burdett O'Connor and the Emancipation of the Americas\\", University of London Institute of Latin American Studies Occasional Papers, No. 20, 1999. He remarried in 1788, to Wilhamena Bowen, who bore him four sons and three daughters. Roger's younger brother Arthur O'Connor was one of the United Irishmen. Roger was himself associated with the movement, editing the nationalist journal Harp of Erin. His two other brothers, Daniel and Robert, were pro-British loyalists. After his oldest brother Daniel got into debt, Roger bought out his inheritance for ¬£5.000. These political and financial conflicts were deepened by a family dispute following the suicide of his sister Anne, who had not been allowed by the family to marry a Catholic man she was in love with. This led to a long feud between Roger and his brother Robert. According to historian James Dunkerley Robert, who was the local sheriff, \\"even tried to have Roger executed\\" for treason because of his involvement with Harp of Erin. Roger and Arthur engaged in nationalist activities in London, building a network of contacts. He went into hiding in the run up to the abortive 1796 rebellion. He subsequently surrendered to the authorities and was released. In July 1797 he assisted in the defence of other accused persons. According to Roger, this act led to further plots against him led by his loyalist brother Robert. He and Arthur were arrested and held in various locations over a period of several years before being finally released. Though an avowed Irish nationalist, O'Connor denied that he had ever been party to treasonable conspiracies. In 1799 he published To the People of Great Britain and Ireland, a booklet that detailed what he considered to be his mistreatment.Roger O'Connor, To the People of Great Britain and Ireland, Dublin, 1799. The O'Connors received considerable support from Whig politicians in Britain. MP and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan wrote that \\"the usage of Roger O'Connor, who is one of the finest fellows I ever saw, has been merciless beyond example\\". O'Connor was held in Fort George near Inverness until 1801, when he was moved to London, but was barred from travelling to Ireland. Dangan Caricature, said by Jane Hayter Hames to depict O'Connor saying \\"Erin go bragh\\" (\\"Ireland forever\\") In 1803 O'Connor was finally allowed to return to Ireland. Following these troubles, O'Connor moved to Dangan Castle, Summerhill, County Meath having acquired the property on a permanently renewable lease from Thomas Burrowes of the East India Company. The castle had been the childhood home of Arthur Wellesley, who later became the Duke of Wellington. O'Connor asserted that he had acquired it as \\"a suitable residence in which to entertain Napoleon\\" after the anticipated defeat of the British.Donald Read & Eric Glasgow, Feargus O'Connor: Irishman and Chartist, Edward Arnold, 1961, p.13. At this time he began his career as a writer, preparing commentaries on the Old Testament. He did so from a position of scepticism towards religion; he once said Voltaire was his God. His wife Wilhamina died in 1806. After her death O'Connor's behaviour apparently became increasingly eccentric and extravagant. In 1809 a large part of the Castle was destroyed by fire. O'Connor was suspected of insurance fraud, as he had recently taken out a policy on the house. Many years later his son Francis (then known as Francisco) wrote in his autobiography that he had accidentally started the fire himself when melting lead to make bullets.Francisco Burdett O'Connor, Independencia Americana: Recuerdos de Francisco Burdett O'Connor, 1895, reprint, La Paz, 1972, p. 5. In 1817 O'Connor and his son Arthur were arrested on a charge of having organised a mail robbery five years earlier, during which a guard was shot and killed. Two of the robbers had been apprehended after attempting to pass some of the stolen property, and had implicated O'Connor. The robbers were labourers employed on O'Connor's estate. It was alleged that O'Connor's steward Martin McKeon had conspired with him to organise the robbery, with McKeon recruiting the robbers. O'Connor was allegedly motivated by debt. Both men were put on trial. Arthur was also arrested, but later released. O'Connor stated that his only connection to the robbery was that his son had found the abandoned mailbags on his land. An endorsement of O'Connor's moral character was given by O'Connor's close friend the MP Sir Francis Burdett, who stated that he was happy to lend any sum of money to O'Connor. O'Connor and McKeon were both acquitted, as the accusers' evidence was not considered credible. O'Connor and his supporters pointed out that the robbers had been spared the death penalty for testifying against him. O'Connor published his version of events, in which he argued that there had been a conspiracy to have him convicted. He claimed this was only the most recent of ten conspiracies to kill him, \\"being the first against my character‚Äîthe tenth against my life in the past twenty-four years\\". Its real purpose was to destroy his reputation among the local people who \\"adored\\" him: O'Connor's later attempt to sue one of the accusers for perjury brought out details of events on the night of the robbery that led to continued suspicion against him. Local support was also undermined when he was cross-examined about his religious views, and asserted that the Bible was not a divine revelation. John P. Prendergast, in an article on O'Connor, says that \\"thenceforth Roger O'Connor stood condemned in public opinion of the robbery for the Galway mail\\". Shortly after these events O'Connor's landlord attempted to get him evicted from Dangan, but the attempt failed. Nevertheless, O'Connor left the property and moved to Paris. It was later alleged by McKeon's son that the robbery was a cover for the interception of compromising letters written by Burdett to a married lover. This was supposed to explain Burdett's support of O'Connor.O'Connor, Roger, Dictionary of National Biography While these events were unfolding, O'Connor's teenage sons Feargus and Francis fled the family home, travelled to London and asked to be looked after by Francis Burdett. Burdett took them in. O'Connor's oldest son Roderic moved to Australia. Chronicles of Eri O'Connor depicted by Abraham Wivell, holding a crown signifying his claim to be the rightful king of Ireland While in Paris, O'Connor prepared his best-known work, the Chronicles of Eri (1822), a book purporting to be a translation of ancient manuscripts detailing the early history of the Irish people. It was dedicated to his friend and supporter Sir Francis Burdett. The book was prefaced by a portrait of O'Connor holding a crown, the caption to which proclaimed that he was the \\"Head of his Race\\" and \\"Chief of the prostrated people of his nation\\", a position he claimed as the supposed lineal descendant of the 12th-century king Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair. According to O'Connor, he had attempted to write this book three times before, but had been frustrated by the machinations of his enemies, who stole his manuscripts. Another version of the book had been destroyed in the disastrous fire at Dangan in 1809. The book gives a history of the Gaels from supposed records written by \\"Eolus\\", who is said to have lived fifty years after Moses. It claims a continuous existence of the Gaelic people, originating among the ancient Phoenicians, migrating to Scythia, Spain and then Ireland. O'Connor interpreted Biblical stories and medieval Irish lore to support this narrative. William John Fitzpatrick in the Dictionary of National Biography stated that the book is \\"mainly, if not entirely, the fruit of O'Connor's imagination\\". Last years O'Connor returned to county Cork, but had by this time had lost much of his money. He lived for the rest of his life in a fisherman's cottage in Ballincollig, cohabiting with a local young woman he called the \\"princess of Kerry\\". According to Richard Robert Madden, O'Connor genuinely believed that this \\"young girl of humble origin\\" was really a princess: \\"The enthusiasm with which he is said to have been wont to speak of the exalted claims of this princess of Kerry to an ancient Irish regal origin, left no doubt on the minds of many who heard him expatiate on this subject, that he had worked himself up into a firm belief in his fondly-imagined discovery.\\"Richard Madden, The United Irishmen: Their Lives and Times, Dublin, 1858, p.595-9. She inherited \\"a considerable sum of money\\" from him on his death.\\" His oldest son Roderic O'Connor emigrated to Australia with his two sons, where he became a significant landowner and public official in Tasmania.P. R. Eldershaw, O'Connor, Roderic, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 2, (MUP), 1967. Two of Roger's sons were brought up by Burdett. One of these was Feargus O'Connor, one of the main leaders of the Chartists. The other was Francisco Burdett O'Connor, a commander in Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's army and, later, a Bolivian politician. Assessment Prendergast concludes that O'Connor showed great courage in his patriotic statements during his arrest and imprisonment for alleged sedition, but that his eccentric personality and Irish nationalism \\"rendered him so odious [in the eyes of his enemies] that the grossest charges would be willingly believed\\". James Dunkerley says that several authors have described O'Connor as \\"a little mad\\", adding that the Chronicles of Eri is a \\"colourful concoction - a more 'imagined community' it would be hard to locate outside of Atlantis\\". Madden considered him to be possessed of considerable \\"cleverness, cunning, astuteness and plausibility\\", but argued that the personal charm and persuasiveness that made his conversation and speech-making so powerful, was never translated into print. His writings were bombastic: \\"he wrote in the genuine Boanerges Bombastes-Furioso style, wherein the swaggering Pistol talked in the true Ercles vein. His various political pamphlets are couched in terms of extravagant hyperbole\\".

When a driver located a parking space with the help of the app, they clicked a button in the app when they arrived and simply drove away later, being billed only for the time they were parked. This was made possible by the sensors already built into parking bays. Since January 2016, AppyParking provides a feature which shows the nearest and cheapest petrol stations anywhere in the UK. In September 2016, founder Dan Hubert appeared on BBC business show Dragon's Den seeking investment to expand the service, valuing the company at ¬£10m ($m) based on a 2% equity offered for a sum of ¬£200,000 ($).Dragons‚Äô Den: Series 14, Episode 7 ‚Äì Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas He was unsuccessful after declining two offers from Peter Jones and Nick Jenkins, who instead valued the company at ¬£1m ($m). In January 2019 AppyParking launched the world‚Äôs first integrated Smart City Parking solution in the North Yorkshire town of Harrogate. The solution combines technical capabilities such as smart parking sensors, automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) barriers and sensor-enabled payments into a consolidated system, offering a seamless experience for users across both on and off-street parking and a powerful kerbside utilisation tool for local authorities. In June 2019 AppyParking launched Mapper, their traffic regulation order management solution, a major piece of the puzzle for local governments to manage their kerbside. In the UK, traffic orders (also known as traffic management orders, TROs and TMOs) are legal documents drafted and made by the council which regulate the use of highways for movement and parking and also off street parking areas within the borough by drivers of vehicles and/or pedestrians. Mapper was designed in partnership with InnovateUK and three local authorities. It is a highly intuitive tool that provides fully standardised data formats with an output available via API. In July 2019 AppyParking closed a Series A round of investment worth ¬£7.6m ($m) from investors including Hyundai Motor Company and Sumitomo Corporation. The company has raised a total of ¬£11m ($m) as of 2019 and is now valued at ¬£50m ($m) after its 2019 round. As of 2019, AppyParking hosts the largest dataset of the UK's kerbside restrictions, with over 450 UK towns and cities mapped within the AppyParking mobile app and Kerbside API. AppyParking rebranded as AppyWay in September 2019. AppyWay launched its second Smart City Parking scheme in the town of Halifax in October 2019.  Awards  AppyWay's solutions have won several industry awards and accolades, most recently taking home two British Parking Awards 2020. AppyWay won the Intelligent Parking award for the world-leading Smart City Parking scheme (SCP) in Harrogate. The scheme is benefiting residents and visitors in Harrogate through real-time availability and seamless pay-as-you-go payments via the AppyParking mobile app. For the two local authority stakeholders, the system provides them with complete visibility over their kerbside via an analytics dashboard. The second award, the Parking Partnerships award, went to Future Ready Traffic Orders by the AppyWay solution Mapper. Mapper is the cloud-based, traffic order management solution a local authority needs to digitally manage traffic orders and provide open access to standardised kerbside data. Future Ready Traffic Orders by Mapper was created in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council, Coventry City Council and Milton Keynes Council.  Technology  AppyWay uses Google Maps overlays to display areas, and projects its dataset in the form of pins. The app retrieves the user's location and the present date and time to provide a list of prices, and connects with routing apps like Maps and Waze to direct the user to the parking site.

He was the Communist Party Secretary of Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, from 2011 to 2015. Prior to that, he served as the party chief in the neighbouring city of Wuxi for seven years, and before that the Mayor of Suzhou. In 2015, Yang was put under investigation for corruption by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China. He was tried and convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to twelve years and six months in prison in December 2016. Career Yang was born in Nantong, Jiangsu province in August 1962. He traces his ancestry to the Changzhou area. His father was a hospital administrator in the city of Nantong. Yang went to college at the Nanjing Marine Engineering Institute (), where he studied marine and seaport engineering. He began working in the Jiangsu provincial transportation department in August 1981. In 1998, he became the provincial director of transportation. The next year, he was transferred to become Deputy Party Secretary of Suzhou, and later Mayor. In 2004, Yang became the party chief of Wuxi, becoming first-in-charge of the southern Jiangsu city. By 2006, at age 44, he had earned a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee. According to the Beijing Youth Daily, during Yang's term in Suzhou, he reportedly maintained close relations with the family of Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee, who was a native of the region. Yang was said to have received praise from Zhou for his work in controlling the razing of local residential neighbourhoods near Zhou's hometown. In 2011, he became the Party Secretary of the provincial capital Nanjing. Chinese language media have suggested that Yang was once subject to a formal disciplinary complaint by Gao Dezheng (), former executive Vice Governor of Jiangsu and the father-in-law of Ji Jianye; Ji was Mayor of Nanjing during Yang's term as the city's party boss. As the city's two most prominent political leaders, Ji and Yang had an uneasy, often hostile relationship. Yang publicly criticized Ji over a rainwater diversion construction project in Nanjing led by the mayor. Ji was abruptly removed from his office of mayor (Shuanggui) in December 2013 to face a corruption investigation. Yang also served as the president of the organizing committee of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, spearheading a strategy of using temporary venues for competition and spending frugally. Yang said, \\"No new venues will be built if old ones can be renovated, No new facilities will be purchased if old ones can be repaired, no equipment will be bought if (it) can be rented, and they won't be rented if they can be borrowed,\\" echoing a famous phrase used by former President Liu Shaoqi. Yang was an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Investigation After the dismissal of Ji Jianye, rumours about Yang himself being \\"in trouble\\" began circulating in late 2013. For much of 2014, Yang executed the party's anti-corruption and \\"mass line\\" campaigns with great fervour in Nanjing, ostensibly as a display of loyalty to the new party leadership under Xi Jinping. In addition, in preparation for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing, Yang called upon the city to embrace the slogan, \\"work hard for one hundred days, clean up the environment.\\" Between April and August, various \\"clean-up\\" initiatives took place across the city. During this time, Yang was said to have visited all the sporting venues and surrounding areas to ensure that work was being completed as planned. The \\"one hundred day clean-up\\" campaign earned Yang praise from local residents. In May, Yang said that Nanjing was open to the idea of hosting the 2019 Asian Games after organizers from Vietnam withdrew from hosting the event. In July 2014, state media announced the investigation into China's former security chief and Wuxi-area native Zhou Yongkang. In September 2014, Yang's friend and colleague Feng Yajun (), then serving as the district party chief of Jianye District and a member of the Nanjing Party Standing Committee, was detained for investigation. Several days later, Lou Xuequan (), former party chief of Luhe District of Nanjing, committed suicide in his home. On December 13, the \\"National Commemoration Ceremony\\" for the Nanking Massacre took place in the city, attended by President Xi Jinping. Yang did not accompany Xi's subsequent visit to the Zhenjiang and Nanjing area. After the Commemoration Ceremony, Yang maintained an extremely low-profile, showing reluctance even when signing routine documents and pushing most work onto Mayor Miao Ruilin. On January 1, 2015, Yang took part in a long-distance running race to ring in the new year at the Nanjing City Wall. Those who attended the race reported that Yang looked extremely stressed and uneasy. On January 4, 2015, Yang was detained by officials from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Party's internal anti-graft agency, on \\"suspected serious violations of displinary and law\\". His wife and deputy chief of staff was also reported to have been detained on the same day. Yang was chairing a \\"democratic life meeting\\" when he was informed by an assistant that his presence was immediately required at the provincial party headquarters. Yang promptly adjourned the meeting and made his way there. According to a Jiangsu party disciplinary official, upon realizing he was being apprehended by party disciplinary personnel, Yang attempted to kill himself by jumping out of a window at the provincial party headquarters but was ultimately restrained from doing so. Expulsion and Sentencing Following an investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, on July 31, 2015, Yang was expelled from the Communist Party of China. In an official statement, the CCDI accused Yang of \\"gravely violating organizational discipline, hiding personal information [from the authorities], accepting cash gifts, seeking gain for others using the convenience of his office [...] violating the Eight-point Regulation, frequenting high-end hotels and private clubs, accepting banquet invitations from others; using the convenience of his office to seek promotion or further business interests of others, and taking huge bribes.\\" Of these offenses cited, most were merely violations of party discipline; however, bribery constituted a crime. Yang's case was forwarded to judicial authorities for prosecution. On December 14, 2016, Yang Weize was sentenced for 12 years and 6 months in prison, having been convicted on charges of bribery by the Ningbo People's Intermediate Court. Two million yuan of personal assets were seized, and all of his earnings deemed to have come from corrupt sources were confiscated by the national treasury. The total value of bribes recorded by the court was 16.43 million yuan.

Early life His father, Solomon Eytinge, was a Dutch merchant who settled in New York and married an American woman, Mary Ann Miller.Wedding at St Stephens Episcopal Church, 4 September 1821, reference: New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol. 140, No. 3, July 2009; page 221 Sol Eytinge was born in New York on the 23 October 1833. The census returns of 1860, 1880 & 1890 indicate Eytinge's place of birth was New York but several references put his place of birth as Philadelphia. Eytinge's mother came from Philadelphia and his father settled in Philadelphia when he first arrived in America. Career By the age of twenty three he was an established staff artist at Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper where he mentored a sixteen-year-old Thomas Nast. Shortly afterwards, he worked for the New York Illustrated News later contributing to the journals Every Saturday and Harper's Weekly. His colleagues at this time included Frank Bellew and the brothers Alfred and William Waud. Eytinge and his group of friends frequented Charles Pfaff's beer cellar on Broadway and they were part of the Bohemian social scene that existed in New York at this time. Before Pfaff's had opened in 1855, Eytinge was involved with a circle of writers and artists who referred to themselves as the Ornithorhynchus Club. One friend, the writer William Winter, described Eytinge as a \\"man of original and deeply interesting character, an artist of exceptional facility, possessed of a fine imagination and great warmth of feeling.... In his prime as a draughtsman he was distinguished for the felicity of his invention, the richness of his humor, and the tenderness of his pathos. He had a keen wit and was the soul of kindness and mirth‚Äù. CHARLES DICKENS From a Lithograph by SOL. EYTINGE, Jr. In 1867 Sol Eytinge was asked by publishers Field, Osgood & Co. of Boston to prepare a series of drawings to illustrate the work of Charles Dickens, who was due to tour America. These were published in a series of books referred to as the Diamond Edition. Dickens liked and approved the drawings and the two men got on well enough for Eytinge to be able to sketch a portrait of the author. One of Eytinge's illustrations for A Christmas Carol was of Bob Cratchit with Tiny Tim on his shoulder; this iconic portrayal was the first time a drawing showing this scene had been published. Eytinge visited Dickens in England who then invited him to see the darker side of London life. The illustrations for the Dickens books were later published in the Every Saturday journal. Eytinge was a prolific illustrator and his work was included in books for authors such as Louisa May Alcott, Robert Browning, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell, Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Annie Edwards and John Greenleaf Whittier plus many others. Family In 1858 he married divorcee, Margaret (Winship) Wyckoff, who had two children from her previous marriage, one of whom took the name of her new step father and became actress Pearl Eytinge. Eytinge's wife was a published author and wrote under the names of Margaret Winship Eytinge, Madge Elliot, Bell Thorne and Allie Vernon. Several of Eytinge's relatives were connected with the theatre: Samuel D. EytingeSamuel D. Eytinge (1829-1859), married Emily Kelly Moss, sister of Theodore Moss, treasurer and later manager of Wallack's Theatre. Emily had a son from her first marriage who took his stepfather's name to become actor, Walter Eytinge (1854-1893). and Rose Eytinge were cousins and his brother Charles D. Eytinge was a renowned ‚Äúreader‚Äù. Another brother, Harry, was a producer and actor. His nephew, Dennis Miller Bunker, was an impressionist painter. Eytinge died in Bayonne, New Jersey on 26 March 1905 and is buried in Bayview-New York Bay Cemetery.

Believed to be built in the early 1860s, it is one of a very small number of relatively unaltered rural 19th-century blacksmithies in the state. It is owned and operated by the local historical society as a museum, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The smithy is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and a wood shingle exterior. A shed-roofed addition extends across the western facade. The main facade, facing south, is four bays wide, with the main entrance in one of the center bays and sash windows in the other bays. The main double door is attached via heavy wrought iron hinges. The interior is very plain, with exposed framing, and houses a collection of original 19th- century blacksmithing tools. The shop was probably built in the early 1860s by Nicholas A. Chandler, whose family owned the land at the time, and who was listed in later business directories as a blacksmith, but was also known for breeding and training horses. The next owner, Henry Parsons, was Chandler's brother-in-law, and is believed to be responsible for a number of additions and alterations to the building, including changing its roofline and adding the shed-roof addition. Parsons operated the smithy as a business until about 1905, and the shop was thereafter used intermittently by area residents. It was acquired in 1964 by the Dover-Foxcroft Historical Society, which now operates the property as a museum. The society has added a modern building to the property for use as a demonstration area. The museum is open between Memorial Day and October.

It was signed in March 2013 by the Cypriot Government on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Background Credit rating downgrade to speculative On 13 March 2012, Moody's slashed Cyprus's credit rating to speculative status, warning that the Cyprus government would have to inject more fresh capital into its banks to cover losses incurred through Greece's debt swap. On 25 June 2012, the day when Fitch downgraded bonds issued by Cyprus to BB+, which disqualified them from being accepted as collateral by the European Central Bank, the Cypriot government requested a bailout from the European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism. Request for EU intervention and agreement The Cypriot Government was reported requesting a bailout from the European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism on 25 June 2012, citing difficulties in supporting its banking sector from the exposure to the Greek debt. Representatives of the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) arrived on the island in July to investigate the country's financial problems, and submitted the terms of the bailout to the Cypriot government on 25 July. The Cypriot government expressed disagreement over the terms, and continued negotiation with Troika representatives concerning possible alterations to them throughout the following months. On 20 November, the government handed its counter-proposals to the Troika on the terms of the bailout, with negotiations continuing. On 30 November it was reported that Troika and the Cypriot Government had agreed on the bailout terms with only the amount of money required for the bailout remaining to be agreed upon. By contrast, the IMF referred only to \\"good progress towards an agreement\\". The preliminary agreement terms were made public on 30 November. The austerity measures included cuts in civil service salaries, social benefits, allowances and pensions and increases in VAT, tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes, taxes on lottery winnings, property, and higher public health care charges. Memorandum of Understanding On 16 March 2013, the Eurogroup, European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on a ‚Ç¨10 billion deal with Cyprus, making it the fifth country‚Äîafter Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain‚Äîto receive money from the EU-IMF. As part of the deal, a one-off bank deposit levy of 6.7% for deposits up to ‚Ç¨100,000 and 9.9% for higher deposits, was announced on all domestic bank accounts. Savers were due to be compensated with shares in their banks. Measures were put in place to prevent withdrawal or transfer of moneys representing the prescribed levy. The deal required the approval of the Cypriot parliament, which was due to debate it on 18 March. According to President Nicos Anastasiades, failure to ratify the measures would lead to a \\"disorderly bankruptcy\\" of the country. The Russian government \\"blasted Cyprus's bank levy, piling more pressure on the country's capital, Nicosia\\" ahead of the parliament's vote on the bailout. Russia had not decided at the time whether to extend its existing loan to Cyprus. With the background of large demonstrations outside the House of Representatives in Nicosia by Cypriot people protesting the bank deposit levy,http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/cypriots-take-to-streets-over- bank-deposits-tax/story-fnb64oi6-1226600994875 the deal was rejected by the Cypriot parliament on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote. On 22 March, the Cyprus legislature approved a plan to restructure the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), its second largest bank, creating in the process a so-called \\"bad bank\\". On 25 March, Cyprus President Anastasiades, Eurozone finance ministers, and IMF officials announced a new plan to preserve all insured deposits of 100,000 Euros or less without a levy, but shut down Laiki Bank, levying all uninsured deposits there, and levying 47.5% of uninsured deposits in Bank of Cyprus, held mostly by wealthy Russians and Russian multinational corporations who use Cyprus as an offshore bank and safe tax haven. The revised agreement, expected to raise 4.2 billion Euros in return for a ‚Ç¨10 billion bailout, does not require any further approval of the Cypriot parliament, as the legal framework for the implied solutions for Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus has already been accounted for in the bill passed by the parliament last week. When the final agreement was settled on 25 March, the idea of imposing any sort of deposit levy was dropped, as it was instead now possible to reach a mutual agreement with the Cypriot authorities accepting a direct closure of the most troubled Laiki Bank. Remaining good assets and deposits below ‚Ç¨100,000 with Laiki Bank would be saved and transferred to Bank of Cyprus (BoC), while shareholder capital would be written off, and the uninsured deposits above ‚Ç¨100,000 ‚Äì along with other creditor claims ‚Äì would be lost to the degree being decided by how much the receivership subsequently can recover from liquidation of the remaining bad assets. As an extra safety measure, uninsured deposits above ‚Ç¨100,000 in BoC will also remain frozen until a recapitalisation has been implemented (with a possible imposed haircut if this is later deemed needed to reach the requirement for a 9% tier 1 capital ratio). The targeted closure of Laiki and recapitalisation plan for BoC helped significantly to reduce the needed loan amount for the overall bailout package, so that ‚Ç¨10bn was still sufficient without need for imposing a general levy on bank deposits. The final conditions for activation of the bailout package were outlined by the Troika's MoU agreement, which was endorsed in full by the Cypriot House of Representatives on 30 April 2013, and included: The Cypriot debt-to-GDP ratio is on this background now forecasted only to peak at 126% in 2015 and subsequently decline to 105% in 2020, and thus considered to remain within sustainable territory. The ‚Ç¨10bn bailout comprise ‚Ç¨4.1bn spend on debt liabilities (refinancing and amortization), 3.4bn to cover fiscal deficits, and ‚Ç¨2.5bn for the bank recapitalization. These amounts will be paid to Cyprus through regular tranches from 13 May 2013 until 31 March 2016. According to the programme this will be sufficient, as Cyprus during the programme period in addition will: # Receive ‚Ç¨1.0bn extraordinary revenue from privatization of government assets. # Ensure an automatic roll-over of ‚Ç¨1.0bn maturing Treasury Bills and ‚Ç¨1.0bn of maturing bonds held by domestic creditors. # Bring down the funding need for bank recapitalization with ‚Ç¨8.7bn, of which 0.4bn is a reinjection of future profits earned by the Central Bank of Cyprus (injected in advance in the short term, by obtaining state land as consideration), and ‚Ç¨8.3bn originating from the bail-in of creditors in Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus. Given the proposed and actual element of taking deposits as part of the agreement, it was sometimes referred to as a \\"bail-in\\" rather than a bailout.Bjork, Christopher, , MarketWatch, 27 March 2013. Headline reference is to ECB governing council member Yves Mersch. Retrieved 27 March 2013. Exit of the bailout support programme Although the bailout support programme feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its access to the private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold ‚Ç¨0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, to the tune of a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another ‚Ç¨1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a ‚Ç¨0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued by the end of April 2015, ‚Ç¨1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield and maturity on 6 May 2022.

The story is told from multiple first person points of view; the two main narrators are Alma Rivera, a 30-something housewife from P√°tzcuaro, Mexico, and Mayor Toro, a teenage social outcast and first-generation American whose parents were originally from Panama.  Development and publication history Henr√≠quez originally conceived the novel as a short story told from Mayor's point of view. The 304-page book was published on June 3, 2014 by Knopf. Plot Alma and Arturo Rivera leave their comfortable surroundings in P√°tzcuaro, Mexico when their daughter Maribel suffers a severe head injury. Their journey into the United States leads them to Newark, Delaware where they have located a school, Evers, for the learning disabled. Maribel's head injury has left her severely brain damaged, and they plan to enroll her in Evers in hopes of helping her with her recovery. Arturo has obtained a work visa, and he is able to get a job at a mushroom factory. However, their life beyond his job remains uncertain; they do not have a stable home environment, Alma does not work, and Maribel has not been officially accepted to Evers. The Rivera's encounter the plight of many poor immigrants. They do not know how to speak English, they are unfamiliar with the school systems, and they are new to American culture. They find emotional support when they meet Rafael and Celia Toro. The Toro family have two sons, Enrique and Mayor, and they live in the same low-income apartment complex as the Rivera's. The Toro parents are immigrants from Panama who have become legal citizens but struggle to get by on one meager income. Celia Toro befriends Alma Rivera, and both women grow quite fond of each other. When Celia's son Mayor meets Maribel he is immediately attracted to her. Yet given her inability to speak fluidly due to her head injury, he learns to communicate with her through other means. But their relationship is threatened by Garrett Miller, a boy at Mayor's school, who constantly bullies Mayor. One day after school, Garrett follows them and he bullies Mayor and accosts Maribel. Days later, Garrett sexually assaults Maribel. Her mother Alma witnesses the assault, and she immediately goes to the police. The police dismiss the incident in part because Alma does not know how to speak English well. Her lack of English speaking skills lead to miscommunication and a misunderstanding of the facts. The police officer characterizes the incident as two teenagers who are most likely infatuated with one another and a mother who is not savvy about these common liaisons among teenagers. Alma is traumatized by the assault, and she is deeply concerned Arturo will blame her for not keeping Maribel safe. Soon after she meets with the police, she decides not to tell Arturo about the entire incident. Arturo eventually loses his job and he is unable to find a new one. His new unemployment status causes him to lose his visa, and his non-visa status also affects his family's legal standing. They can no longer legally stay in the United States. Meanwhile, Quisqueya Solis, a prying neighbor who has also been the victim of assault, tells Alma that Mayor and Maribel were alone together kissing in a car. Quisqueya suggests, by pure speculation, that Mayor may have been taking advantage of Maribel. This news triggers Alma's trauma when she witnessed Garrett assaulting her daughter. She confronts Celia and bans Mayor from seeing her daughter. One day in March, after the first snowfall of the year, Mayor steals his father's new used car. He drives to Maribel's school and he helps her leave school grounds on false pretenses. They take a drive to the beach. When Maribel does not come home from school, Alma thinks Garrett may have kidnapped her and sexually assaulted her again. This concern leads her to tell her husband the truth about the Garrett Miller assault. Arturo is infuriated when he hears the news and decides to go to Garrett's house. When he arrives at Garrett's house he encounters Garrett's father, who is also enraged, and who points a gun at Arturo and then pulls the trigger. When Mayor and Maribel return home they learn that Arturo has been shot by Garrett's father. He dies at the hospital, and Alma decides to return home to Mexico shortly after. As a final gesture of friendship, Celia and her other neighbors donate money that Alma needs to transport Arturo's body back to Mexico. Characters Main characters Alma Rivera - The novel is told mainly through the perspective of Alma, the Rivera family matriarch.

In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Daniel Olivas said the book \\"is as disturbing as it is beautiful, a testament to the mixed blessings our country offers immigrants, who struggle against bigotry and economic hardship while maintaining just enough hope to keep striving for something better...a narrative mosaic that moves toward a heartrending conclusion.\\" In Bustle, Claire Luchette described The Book of Unknown Americans as a \\"powerful novel...about love: familial love, two kids' first love, love of friends, neighbor, and country.\\" In The Guardian, Sandra Newman felt the \\"strength of the book is in the quiet details\\", but criticized Henr√≠quez for spending \\"too much time on the periphery of her story, making points that feel at once too vague and too obvious.\\" Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Ana Castillo found the novel \\"unfailingly well written and entertaining, [but] more often than not the first-person accounts don't seem quite authentic.\\" The novel was chosen as one of The Best Books of 2014 by Amazon.com. The Daily Beast named it the 2014 novel of the year.

Biography  Sergey Pavlovich Kravkov was born 21 June 1873 in Ryazan in the family of a non-commissioned officer Pavel Alexeyevich Kravkov (1826-1910), who served as a senior clerk in the office of the Chief Enlistment Officer of the Ryazan Governorate. According to the family legend, the scientist's mother Evdokia (Avdotia) Ivanovna (1834-1891), before wedding a ¬´Kaluga petty bourgeois¬ª, was an illegitimate daughter of Konstantin Kavelin (1818-1885), a famous Russian historian, jurist and sociologist, one of the ideologists of Russian liberalism at the age of the reforms of Alexander II. In 1882-1892 Sergey Kravkov attended the First Ryazan Gymnasium. In 1892-1896 he went on to study at the Natural Science Department of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Imperial Saint Petersburg University. The future scientist's graduation thesis ‚ÄúOn the crop rotation‚Äù was awarded a gold medal. After the graduation Sergey Kravkov remained at the Agronomy Chair of the Imperial Saint Petersburg University where he worked under the guidance of Professor Sovetov. In 1898 his first scientific work ‚ÄúK voprosu o vliyanii elektrizatsii pochvy na sovershayuschiesya v ney processy‚Äù (On the effect of electrostatic charging of soil on the processes going on in it) was published. In 1898 Sergey Kravkov carried on geobotanical researches in the Derkul steppe in Kharkov Governorate. Their results were published in the ‚ÄúTrudy Volnogo ekonomicheskogo obschestva‚Äù (Works of the Free Economic Society) and the ‚ÄúZemledelcheskaya gazeta‚Äù (Agricultural newspaper). The years from 1898 to 1900 Sergey Kravkov spent in practical trainings abroad (Germany, Switzerland, France, Great Britain). After that he had headed for two years a research farm of the Agricultural Institute of Nowa Aleksandria (now Pu≈Çawy in Poland). In these years the scientist gained wide practical and agronomical exrerience. Since 1901 Kravkov prelected general agronomics at the Professor Stebut's Agricultural Courses for Women. The years from 1903 to 1904 Sergey Kravkov also spent abroad. He worked in Munich under the guidance of Professor Ramann, studied the products of descomposition of organic substances. In 1904 Sergey Kravkov returned to the Imperial Saint Petersburg University, passed master's exams and was elected a privatdocent to deliver lectureson chemical and biological processes in soil. Also in 1906-1909 Kravkov worked at the experimental forest district of Veliko-Anadol, studying the problem of drying up of forests in the steppe. In 1908 he became one of the founders of the Agricultural Institute at Kamenny Island in Saint Petersburg. In 1908 Sergey Kravkov defended the master's thesis ‚ÄúMaterialy po izucheniyu processov razlozheniya rastitelnykh ostatkov v pochve‚Äù (Materials on the study of the processes of descomposition of vegetal remains in soil) at the Imperial Kazan University. In 1909 he was elected Associate Professor of Agronomy at the Imperial Saint Petersburg University. He was in charge of a compulsory course ‚ÄúSoil science and agrochemistry‚Äù. In 1912 Sergey Kravkov defended the Doctor's thesis ‚ÄúIssledovaniye v oblasti izucheniya roli mertvogo rastitelnogo pokrova v pochvakh‚Äù (Study on the role of dead plant remains in soil) at the Imperial Yuryev University (now the Tartu University in Estonia), examining in it the processes of transformation of organic substances. He became the fourth Doctor of Agronomy in Russia. At the same time Kravkov was elected the Head of the Agronomy Chair of the Imperial Saint Petersburg University and held this position till his death in 1938. Under Kravkov's guidance intensive experimental works on the problems of humus formation and soil chemistry were carried on. The problem of humus formation had remained the main theme of the scientist's investigations for his whole life. Kravkov was the first to pay attention to the fact that the soil is an element that is constantly gradually changing and is not in a state of fixed chemical balance. Developing the ideas of Vasily Dokuchaev, Sergey Kravkov appealed to permanent systematic studies of soil horizons, qualifying the dynamics of soil processes as ‚Äúthe life of soil‚Äù. He organized observations of dynamics of soil processes. After the October revolution of 1917 Sergey Kravkov joined the preparation of agronomy staff for the needs of the economy of a new state. In 1922 the scientist was one of those who took part in the foundation of an independent Chair of Experimental Soil Science at the Petrograd State University. In 1921-1925 Kravkov headed the Department of Applied Soil Science at the North-West Regional Agricultural Experimental Station. Since 1926 he took an active part in the work of the State Institute of Experimental Agronomy. In 1927 Sergey Kravkov was one of the members of the Soviet delegation that took part in the First International Congress of Soil Science in Washington, D.C. He also participated in the work of the Second International Congress of Soil Science that took place in Leningrad and Moscow in 1930. When in 1932 the Kirov Higher Communist School of Agriculture was founded in Leningrad Sergey Kravkov was invited to head its Chair of General Agriculture and to deliver lectures on soil science. In 1934 Sergey Kravkov was awarded a scientific rank of Doctor of Science in Geology. On 10 November 1934 the decision of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee gave him a title of Honoured Scientist of the RSFSR. Sergey Pavlovich Kravkov died in Leningrad on 12 August 1938. He was buried at Smolenskoye Cemetery. Kravkov's research work extended and deepenedthe scientific insight on the soil formation processes, contributed to the wide spread of the idea of dynamism of all soil phenomena. His work was continued by a number of talented disciples ‚Äì the Soviet soil scientists.  Family  In 1909 Sergey Kravkov married an artist Mariya Mikhailovna Buraya (1861-?). He educated a stepdaughter Mariya. The scientist's elder brothers were Vasily Kravkov (1859-1920), army medical officer of high rank, author of memories about Russo-Japanese War and World War I, and Nikolai Kravkov (1865-1924), a prominent pharmacologist.  Memory  By the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR in 1939 the Laboratory of Experimental Soil Science of the Leningrad State University was named after Sergey Pavlovich Kravkov.

Organization   Contemporary art center  Le consortium de Dijon The objectives of Le Consortium are the production and exhibition of contemporary works, the enrichment of the public heritage in this area, the promotion, diffusion and training to art and today's thinking. Le Consortium is also in a process of reflection and experimentation in cultural engineering and administration of artistic activities related to performing arts. Le Consortium finds its origin in the mid-70's alternative structures, installed in the heart of the cities, and designed as power balances and independent places. Le Consortium's first actions have been realized with the most protester artists regarding to the language or the way to make art, as Buren, Mosset, Toroni, Rutault, Boltanski, Messager, Le Gac, Baldessari, Luthi... The Contemporary Art Center organizes 8 solo or group exhibitions of international artists each year. It hosted the works of Chris Burden, R√©my Zaugg, Yayoi Kusama, but also the first exhibition in France and even in Europe of today recognized artists as Jorge Pardo, Maurizio Cattelan, Sylvie Fleury, Mark Leckey, Rachel Harrison, Charline von Heyl...  The Collection  The collection contains more than 250 works of international artists - mostly acquired at the beginning of their careers - which have been the subject of an exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1998 and which are regularly loaned to many institutions. The collection allows a constant rotation in our exhibition spaces, creating a real educational tool in conjunction with the temporary shows.

Since 1991, Le Consortium has been mediator of the Fondation de France within the framework of the Nouveaux Commanditaires activities in Bourgogne, which give individuals, organizations, and public corporations the opportunity to commission a contemporary artwork. One of the goals of the project is to help local development through tourism. The Art & Society department works in collaboration with the European LEADER programme for rural and cultural development.  Public Commissions  Le Consortium, thanks to its long experience in the domain of contemporary art and to the relationship it built with the most famous artists over the years, is particularly qualified to lead public art projects : from isolated public artworks, in rural or urban areas, to big sets of works acting together in coherence, including projects designed in accordance with the social and cultural context of the territory in which they are implanted. Here below are a few examples of the public commissions recently carried out by Le Consortium.  Lille (France)  FLOWER POWER ¬ª / LILLE 2004, European Capital of Culture *dates : 6 Dec 2003 ‚Äì 8 Feb 2004 at Palais Rameau *dates : 6 Dec 2003 ‚Äì 22 Jan 2004 at Palais des Beaux-Arts & Mus√©e de l‚Äôhospice Comtesse *Curators : Franck Gautherot, Kim Seung-duk, Xavier Douroux, Eric Troncy & Caroline David. Within the framework of this big-scale show, occupying several places in Lille as museums and cultural centers, Le Consortium conceived a public art project in collaboration with the internationally recognized Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama : Les Tulipes de Shangri-La. Between the train station Lille Europe and the city center, the work takes place in a wide empty place, as a 7,50-meter-high bouquet of colored and wild flowers, emerging among the buildings. Visible from a raised walkway, it is also directly reachable on the esplanade, such as natural flowers that belong to nobody, and anybody. This is Kusama's first monumental sculpture out of Japan.  Anyang (South Korea)  \\"ANYANG PUBLIC ART PROJECT\\" *since 20 October 2007 *Curators : Kim Seung-duk, Franck Gautherot, Sung Won Kim (artistic director & associate curator) Anyang Public Art Project is an exhibition of public commissions and an art festival held in Anyang, a city located at 25 km from Seoul. The objective of this project is to stimulate curiosity, awake the creative spirit of people whose city will be transformed. As a true outdoor laboratory, this project makes temporary and permanent works meet each others. Fifty monumental works of artists from different nationalities are presented in Anyang City : John Armleder, Angela Bulloch, Daniel Buren, Marc Camille Chaimovicz, Eunji Cho, Michael Elmgreen & Ingar Dragset, Rachel Feinstein Sylvie Fleury, Gloria Friedmann, Liam Gillick, Gimhongsok, Dan Graham, Yayoi Kusama, Bertrand Lavier, Olivier Mosset, Mai-Thu Perret, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Gary Webb, Yan Pei Ming...  Doha (Qatar)  \\"MSHEIREB DOWNTOWN DOHA PROJECT\\" *2011 - 2014 Le Consortium acted as an art consultant for the MDD Project, which consists in the re-qualification of a whole district in Doha, capital of Qatar. About 20 outdoor artworks will be installed in the city, punctuating the streets or enhancing the surrounds of museums, schools, mosques... Plus, additional 2- or 3-dimensional works (paintings, photographs, sculptures, furniture...) will be installed in the lobbies of buildings, as much in professional and commercial areas as in the residential zones. Deeply linked to the heritage and the culture of Qatar and its people, such a public collection will gather pieces from local and emerging artists, along with works of internationally recognized ones.  Gwangju (South Korea)  \\"ASIA CULTURE CENTER\\" *since Autumn 2014 Since 2014, Le Consortium takes part into the development of the Asian Culture Center in Gwangju (South Korea), managing the space design, the public art and other related projects like the opening of a culture store.  Research & Development   Building museums, in & out  At the beginning of its activity, Le Consortium was set up in a 30 m2 space, at the first floor of an alternative library in Dijon. The structure early moves to a \\"gallery- apartment\\" and in 1982 finally occupies an old store of 600 m2 in the city center. In parallel in 1991, an old factory of 4000 m2 located in the inner suburbs has been included in the spaces of Le Consortium. In 2008, the art center arranges a shop, at the entrance of the exhibition space, for the sale of books and multiples. In 2009, the Consortium opens an office in Hoxton Street, London, in the continuation of its willing to promote and extend its approach of art and the society. Two years later, in 2011, the famous Japanese architect Shigeru Ban conceived the new building of Le Consortium, in accordance with the consideration of what an art center is in its founders‚Äô minds. As an example, conceptually and architecturally, Le Consortium displays our capacity to invent new forms of spaces and places, and to supervise the construction a museum from alpha to omega, from the building to the programming, including the commercial and promotional matters.  Programming  The next fundamental step of building a museum consists in the programming. Each art center requires a specific agenda, including the permanent hanging of a collection, temporary exhibitions, events or shows, other arts performances, etc. in accordance with its conceptual and artistic definition.

Awards Soyad Adhesives Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award Soy-based adhesives are often used in the manufacturing of wood products such as plywood and medium density fiberboard, especially when environmental concerns for petrochemical-based resins are considered. As a result, Solenis developed a completely formulated soy adhesive for use in wood composites, which offers furniture manufacturers and consumers a safer alternative. Solenis' line of Soyad adhesives contains no formaldehyde and low volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Typical interior wood products include urea formaldehyde (UF) in their adhesives. Over time, UF releases free formaldehyde into the air in a carcinogenic gaseous form, which can be inhaled by humans. Following legislation enacted to reduce formaldehyde emissions, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the United States‚Äô strictest emissions standards. Soyad adhesives meet both CARB Phase 2 standards and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) criteria. As a result of this product development, Solenis (operating as Ashland Water Technologies at the time) was jointly awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award along with Columbia Forest Products and Kaichang Li, Ph.D., of Oregon State University.\\"Soy-Based Adhesives Provide Formaldehyde- Free Alternative for Interior Wood Products\\" United Soybean Board, January 2012 Biobond. 2013 Breakthrough Technology of the Year The Biobond.

It is unclear whether the district had a strong rebel presence before the battle began, or was captured by opposition fighters coming from the outskirts. Meanwhile, thousands of rebel soldiers from Aleppo's northern and eastern countryside began to move towards the city. Fighting in Salaheddine continued into the next day, as the Syrian Army began shelling rebel- controlled districts with artillery and attack helicopters. By the early afternoon of 21 July, rebel forces had penetrated Aleppo's northeastern neighborhoods of Haydariya and Sakhour, where they clashed with the Syrian Army. The fighting drove many residents to safer areas. On 22 July, fighting had spread from Salaheddine and neighboring Saif al-Dawla to al-Jameeliya and its surrounding neighborhoods near the city center, leading to a battle for the city's main intelligence headquarters. By the next day, rebels on the eastern front captured Helweniyeh, and according to a rebel commander, Hanano and the industrial area of Sheikh Najjar as well. Meanwhile, continuing clashes near the city center included a rebel attack on the state TV station and the central prison, where a massacre conducted by security forces had taken place, according to activists. Throughout the day, power was out in much of the city.  Fighting in the city center and army reinforcements  Berri clan militiamen, considered to be \\"Shabiha\\", after their capture by the al- Tawhid Brigade in Aleppo, July 2012 On 24 July 2012, according to Al Jazeera, the FSA launched an offensive to take the city center, leading to heavy fighting near the gates of the Old City, a United Nations World heritage site. Rebel forces on the eastern front continued to push westwards. The FSA set up checkpoints in the eastern al-Sahkour district. Later that day, the Syrian Army employed fighter jets for the first time to bomb rebel-held districts. During the next two days, the government sent thousands of reinforcements to Aleppo. The troops were sent mostly via the M5 highway connecting Damascus and Aleppo from the city's south, and the main Aleppo-Latakia road from the city's west. Rebels conducted deadly attacks on arriving troops. Among the reinforcements that massed on the outskirts of Aleppo were special forces units. By day's end 10,000 soldiers had massed around Aleppo and its countryside. By comparison, 1,500 to 2,000 rebel fighters from around northern Syria arrived to assist the 2,000 already fighting. Fighting raged in the Old City and in the central districts of Jamaliya, Kalasseh, and Bustan al-Qasr. On 27 July, skirmishes occurred on the outskirts as reinforcements continued to arrive. Rebel forces advanced to the central district of Fardous, despite continued bombardment. Kurdish fighters, who had gained control over most of the northern districts of Sheikh Maqsud and Al-Ashrafiya, clashed with Syrian troops a day after they attacked a Kurdish convoy on the airport road.  Salaheddine raid  Situation in Aleppo Governorate as of July 30 2012 On the morning of 28 July 2012, the Syrian Army started an attack against Salaheddine district, which held the largest concentration of rebels. The assault commenced with an eight-hour artillery bombardment, which started at four in the morning, after which tanks and ground troops moved in. During the clashes, rebels, providing unverified video footage, claimed to have shot down a government helicopter gunship, a rare feat. Rebels also claimed that 8‚Äì10 tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed. Rebel forces attacked a strategic police station in the city center for the third day, in an attempt to link up with opposition forces in the northeastern Sakhour district on the eastern front. By the end of the day, the rebels had repelled the assault, but the bombardment continued. Among the FSA fighters killed was a battalion commander. On the next day, fighting continued in Salaheddine. Syrian Army soldiers were reportedly defecting, bringing their tanks. In the evening, state media reported that Salaheddine had been recaptured by the Army. The opposition contrarily claimed to control 35 to 40 percent of the city.  Continued rebel advance  In late July and early August 2012, the FSA continued its offensive in Aleppo, with both sides suffering high casualties. Rebel commanders said their main aim was to capture the city center. Rebels seized a strategic checkpoint in the town of Anadan north of Aleppo, gaining a direct route between the city and the Turkish border, an important rebel supply base. They also captured Al-Bab, northeast of the city with an army base. Later, rebels attacked the Minakh air base, 30 km northwest of Aleppo, with arms and tanks captured at the Anadan checkpoint. Opposition forces continued to make territorial gains in the city, controlling most of eastern and southwestern Aleppo, including Salaheddine and parts of Hamdaniyeh. They continued to target security centers and police stations, as clashes erupted near the Air Force intelligence headquarters in Aleppo's northwestern Zahraa district. Rebels overran several police stations and posts in the central and southern districts of Bab al-Nerab, Al-Miersa, and Salhain, seizing significant amounts of arms and ammunition. An FSA fighter engaged in a shootout on a street in Aleppo The Syrian military continued its attempt to capture Salaheddine, while bombing rebel-held territories throughout the city. Ambushes and executions were common. The Army appeared to have made little effort in sending ground forces to recapture the central and southern districts. The loyalist al-Barre militia began to clash with rebel forces in southern Aleppo and near the city's southeastern international airport. Clashes between the tribesmen and the rebels escalated after Zino Berri's execution.  Stalemate  Free Syrian Army fighter walking among rubble in Aleppo. From 3 to 5 August 2012, the rebel offensive began to stall. The Syrian Army finished deploying 20,000 reinforcements. Rebels retreated after failed attempts to capture Minagh airbase and the state TV station in Izaa district, a few blocks northeast of Salahaddine. On 6 August, a rebel commander was killed in Salahaddine. The media center of the Taweed brigade, located in Sakhour district, was destroyed by an airstrike. Rebels attacked a checkpoint near Aleppo University. Fighting erupted near the presidential palace and government forces shelled rebel positions at the Palace of Justice and in Marjeh and Sha'ar (Terbet Lala) districts. On 7 August, the ancient citadel in the city center was under siege by rebels who controlled the ground on at least two sides. The FSA had reportedly advanced to the Bab Jnƒìn and Sabaa Bahrat districts amidst fierce clashes. In the north, rebels attempted to advance into a Kurdish district, clashing with Kurdish fighters. Jets bombed the area, forcing rebel forces to retreat. Opposition activists confirmed that Aleppo was completely surrounded by government troops. Armored units inched forward on Salahaddine from the south and west. Military snipers deployed on rooftops and tanks were stationed in the streets. Snipers were also positioned in the local roundabout where they prevented rebel reinforcements and supplies from entering the district.  Rebel withdrawal from Salaheddine  Aleppines waiting in a bread line while shelling continues. On the morning of 8 August 2012, the Syrian military launched an offensive to retake Salaheddine, a rebel stronghold that an important southern supply route. The military hoped to link up with troops at the Aleppo Citadel. Rebel fighters were reportedly low on ammunition and exhausted. After intense fighting and shelling in the district throughout the day, half a dozen Army tanks breached the center. In the early morning of the next day, artillery shelling intensified as more tanks moved in. FSA units began to depart. By mid-morning, hundreds of rebel fighters were pulling out of the district, with some leaving the city. Fearing a continued Army advance, some rebel units in nearby Saif al-Dawla and Bustan al-Qasar, districts east of Salaheddine, also began to evacuate. The withdrawal occurred while the city remained relatively quiet, as government forces made little attempt to advance. During the evening of 9 August, troops and armored vehicles, accompanied by the Mukhabarat and the Shabiha, moved into the neighborhood, searching house to house for remaining rebels, as snipers began setting up positions. Fighting continued in the central district of Bab al-Hadid and the southeast district of Bab al- Nairab. Rebel fighters made attempts to recapture Salaheddine, but were held back by snipers and mortar fire.  Army attack on Saif al-Dawla  Approximate situation in Aleppo governorate, mid-August 2012 Bombed out vehicles after street fighting. On 12 August 2012, tanks advanced to the roundabout in Salaheddine which was defended by 150 rebels. During the day, rebels attacked a petrol station in Salaheddine, which was being used as a military base, and killed the base's commander and captured badly needed ammunition and weapons. On 13 August, the Army advanced into the western portion of the Saif al-Dawla district. Security sources in Damascus also stated that the Army was advancing on the rebel-held district of Sukari. The Observatory said opposition fighters attacked a key air force intelligence branch in the western Zahraa district. Rebels again attacked the radio and television station in Aleppo. Video footage showed rebels shooting down a MiG-23BN fighter and executions of prisoners in and around Aleppo by rebel forces. Opposition activists claimed that rebels had nothing to do with the killings. On 15 August, rebels reported that they captured Bab al-Nasr and the surrounding area, forcing soldiers to retreat to the city centre. Situation in Aleppo city, mid-August 2012 On 17 August, heavy fighting was reported at Aleppo International Airport, a strategic gateway to the city. According to SANA, rebels were \\"pushed out from areas on both sides of the airport\\". On 18 August, Army clearing operations were reported in the areas of al-Andalus school, al-Hayat Hospital, Rahmo Khatab school, al-Hamiyat Hospital and Ahmad Saeed school. The army claimed to have taken the area of Maysaloun Hospital. On 20 August, the Japanese TV reporter Mika Yamamoto was killed, the first in Aleppo. On 21 August, both sides claimed advances, although neither could be independently verified. On 22 August, rebels tried to make an advance in Saif al-Dawla, but their attack was repelled by heavy mortar and RPG fire. Government forces shelled Aleppo and two neighbouring towns. The army bombarded rebel weapon stocks to keep them out of the city, according to a security official. He also said reinforcements for both sides were heading to Aleppo.  Clashes in Christian districts  On 23 August 2012, the military reportedly captured three Christian neighborhoods in the Old City, according to residents contacted by AFP. The districts of Jdeydeh, Tela and Sulaimaniyeh had been captured by opposition forces five days before. One resident claimed the Army was celebrated by hundreds of residents, who set up committees to avoid a potential return of the rebels.Syrian rebels fight on for Aleppo despite local wariness https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/syrian- rebels-aleppo-local-hostility The Guardian, 21 August 2012, Retrieved 10 January 2017 The main rebel commander had, earlier in the day, claimed that rebel fighters were near the districts. The military capture was later confirmed by AFP. The capture of the Jdeydeh quarter was initiated by the residents, who took up arms after the rebels set up checkpoints and fired on residents and churches (around Farhat Square). They stormed Al-Hatab Square where most rebels were positioned and took control of it. The Army later joined the Christian militia to expel the rebels from the quarter. CBS News learned that at least 48 of Aleppo's elite businessmen, calling themselves the \\"Front of Aleppo Islamic Scholars\\" (FAIS), hand-picked a provisional city council to take over as Aleppo's new local government. The 48 businessmen were financiers for the Syrian government, who thereby switched sides to the rebels.  War of attrition  Rebels tried to stop government tanks that were advancing from Saif al-Dawla. The Army was also moving in the Sukari district and rebel fighters complained of RPG shortages. The opposition activist group SOHR reported that the Army was trying to take control of Isaa district while state TV claimed the district had been captured from rebels. On 28 August 2012, SANA claimed the Children's Hospital was cleared by the Army. Reports indicated that the Syrian government was indiscriminately attacking civilians at bakeries with artillery rounds and rockets in opposition-controlled areas. Human Rights Watch labeled these as war crimes, as the only military targets were rebels manning the bakeries and that dozens of civilians were killed. On 31 August, rebel fighters announced a major offensive, attacking security compounds and bases. Activists claimed that three warplanes were destroyed when rebels attacked Kwers military airport. The warplanes and artillery continued to fire on rebel positions. SOHR reported that the fighting happened in Sukari, Hanano and Bustan Al Qasr. On 3 September, a Syrian general said that the Army controlled the upper area of Saif al-Dawla and that they were trying to take the whole district. AFP reporters visited Salaheddine and confirmed that it was under Army control. AFP reported that the Army had captured, two days before, two 10-story malls on either side of the main street in Saif al-Dawla, which had been used by rebel snipers. On 6 September, Kurdish activists reported that 21 civilians were killed in the Kurdish neighborhood of Sheikh Maksud when the Army shelled the local mosque and nearby areas. Despite not directly witnessing clashes, residents believed that the attack was in retaliation for locals sheltering anti-government civilians from other districts. The Kurdish Supreme Committee and Popular Protection Units vowed retaliation.  Hanano and Midan fighting  A destroyed tank on a road in Aleppo. On 7 September 2012, rebels attacked the Hanano military base. The FSA managed to free 350 detainees when they overran one of the main security buildings. Those wishing to defect were sent to various fighter positions in the region, while others remained in detention. Several brigades were assigned to the attack. The rebels tried to cut strategic supply lines and silence the artillery. The Army retook the base the next day, after a 20-hour battle with heavy casualties on both sides. The base served as a weapons storage depot, a conscript recruitment centre and housed the headquarters of the local branch of the military police and anti-riot police. According to SOHR, rebels stormed the area reserved for conscript recruitment. On 8 September, SOHR reported that the Syrian Army advanced in Sa'ad al-Ansari (Iza'a), Saif al-Dawla and Salaheddine, following the withdrawal of rebel forces after heavy shelling. 21 Kurdish civilians were killed in the Sheikh Maksud neighborhood when Army forces shelled an area near the Marouf mosque, according to Kurdish activists. Aleppo's main water pump was destroyed during the day. The Syrian government and opposition accused the other of the destruction. On 9 September, a car bomb killed at least 30 civilians and wounded more than 64. The Governor of Aleppo said that the bombing took place near al-Hayat Hospital and the Central Hospital. The bombing caused significant material damage to the two hospitals, al-Nusour al-Zahabiya elementary school and nearby buildings. The next day the FSA took responsibility for the attack, claiming that the facilities were used by government troops. The attack was executed after the Air Force bombed rebel targets in Hanano, killing dozens. During the day, another car bomb exploded near Qutaybah Bin Muslim al-Bahili school in al-Shuhada'a neighbourhood. The bomb killed three civilians and injured six. On 10 September, a three-day rebel assault on the Midan district was defeated and government forces pushed the rebels toward Bostan Pasha. At the same time, at least 20 Syrian soldiers were executed by the rebels after they had been captured at the Hanano barracks. The executors were members of the Hawks of Syria. Over the night of 11‚Äì12 September, the Army pounded rebel positions, focusing on the southern districts of Bustan al-Qasr, Sukari and Kellaseh and the northeastern districts of Sakhour, Sha'ar and Hanano. One resident said that helicopter gunships strafed the rebel district of Bostan Pasha. Fighting took place at dawn 12 September in Al-Nayrab area, five kilometres north of the airport in response to a rebel attack on the airport; the airport remained fully operational. On 13 September, SOHR reported that 11 people were killed in an airstrike by warplanes in the Helweniyeh neighbourhood. Rebel fighters reportedly advanced into Midan, a highly strategic area that opens the way into the main square. One resident said that \\"They were at Bostan Pasha (district) and had already advanced up to Suleyman al-Halabi Street. Now they have entered a street in Midan,\\" after heavy clashes were reported. The fighting in Midan continued into the next day, centering on two police stations. The rebels captured the stations, were driven out by the military, returned in a counter-attack, and were attacked again. SANA claimed that the Army had cleared areas around the Hreitani building, Sports Institute and the Maternity Hospital. The rebels turned St Gregory Church into a battlefield when they tried to progress in Midan, before being forced back by heavy Army resistance. During the night, it was reported that the Army conducted air- strikes on the two police stations, forcing the rebels to retreat. An air- strike was also conducted against a rebel-held police station in Hanano. A unit of the Republican guard seized the Ansar Mosque in the rebel-controlled Arqoub district, which was strategically positioned in front of the Hanano military base. On 15 September, the Army controlled most of al-Midan and set up checkpoints for the first time. Rebels still held some positions on the border between Midan and the rebel-held Bostan Pasha and Arqoub districts. Clashes continued at the entrance of Bostan Pasha and another air-strike hit the police post in Hanano. Beside fightings in al-Midan, SANA reported that the Army had clashed with rebels in al-Firdous and al-Midan. On 16 September, rebel fighters made another attempt to push back into al-Midan. They fired RPGs through a wall encircling an Armenian Orthodox church from their stronghold in Suleiman al-Halabi Street. They then rushed the courtyard of the church but were driven back. Later, the military announced that the armed forces had completely cleared the al-Midan area and taken control of the district. This was confirmed by an AFP correspondent on the ground, although he said that there were a few areas where snipers were still active. The military advanced into the rebel-held Arkoub district. Members of the Republican Guards attacked and captured the Ansar mosque. The mosque had strategic importance, located directly in front of the Hanano military base.  Continued clashes  A Free Syrian Army soldier standing in front of a door with a machine gun On 18 September 2012, clashes were occurring in Iza'a and the government-held western Zahra district. The rebels in Aleppo, due to a lack of foreign supplies, were manufacturing their own weapons. The rebels denied receiving any foreign support in the form of weapons. A rebel commander named Abdelkader el-Hadji stated \\"The weapons we have now we captured from Assad's army. We now have a few tanks. Where do you think we got them? We took them from Assad.\\" On 20 September, the Syrian Army launched an operation to recapture Bustan al-Qasr. Killings occurred near al-Fidaa al-Arabi school. SANA said that other clashes occurred in Hanano, al-Fatayes quarter in al- Jadideh and al-Arqoub area and Qadi Askar roundabout. SANA said \\"heavy losses\\" were inflicted upon the rebels. Government troops engaged in street battles in the rebel-held Suleiman al-Halabi district, adjacent to al-Midan. Opposition forces attempted to unite the two largest rebel groups in Aleppo and the surrounding countryside under one command, so they could better coordinate. Analysts claimed that the stalemate was due to the Army's low morale and an inability to reinforce and resupply troops from Damascus via the highway. The government discussed the use of chemical weapons as a last resort, and Der Spiegel reported that the Syrian government had restarted chemical weapons tests in nearby Safira at the end of August. Aleppo activists reported 37 civilians killed within Aleppo city from the Army's overnight bombardment. Over the night of 20/21 September, fighting erupted near the Hanano military base, SOHR said. Bustan al-Qasr was still under attack after the Army attempted to recapture it. The Army also attacked Shakour during the day. Clashes were reported in Shakour roundabout where dozens of rebels had been killed, SANA said. On 22 September, SANA said that the Army had recaptured the Third Industrial Institute in Suleiman al-Halabi neighbourhood and destroyed several rebel centres. The fighting for Suleimal al-Halabi had started two days before. The next day, the Syrian army had recaptured Qasr al-Wali restaurant in al-Sayyid Ali which was used as a rebel operations centre, according to SANA. On 24 September, SANA said the Syrian Army took the Agricultural Institute and areas of al-Quran Mosque and Ali Nasser Agha School in Suleiman al-Halabi. SANA claimed that the Syrian army also recaptured the Christian al-Jdeideh neighbourhood. On 25 September, an Army source told AFP that the Army's operations in Arkoub were finished and that the Army was involved in a door-to-door search for rebels. However, SOHR said that clashes were ongoing in Arkoub. SANA also reported continuing clashes in Suleiman al- Halabi and that clashes occurred in the Western al-Sakhour area and near al- Hakim Hospital in al-Shaar area. AFP reported on a meeting of rebel brigade commanders, at which the overall assessment of the situation was that they were in a stalemate due to a lack of ammunition, despite the capture of 5,000 assault rifles and 2,500 rocket launchers during the earlier raid on the Hanano military base.  September rebel offensive  Doctors and medical staff treating injured rebel fighters in Aleppo According to multiple sources, a new opposition offensive began on 27 September 2012, which promised to be \\"zero hour\\" in the start of a \\"decisive battle\\" to capture the city. A rebel commander said they wanted to surprise the Army, which had started to creep forward towards the southern neighborhoods. He claimed the Tawhid brigade was enticing the Army forward. The operation included 6,000 fighters of the Tawhid brigade, in addition to brigades such as al-Fatah and Ahfad al-Fatiheen for the Turkmen. Weapons and ammunition captured during the attack on the Hananou base were used. He denied that the FSA had proclaimed \\"decisive\\" battles for Aleppo before. The government texted most of the mobile/cellphones in the area that read in part: \\"You have two choices; either be killed facing the State or the State will kill you to get rid of you, you decide...the game is over...the countdown has begun to expel all militants from neighboring countries...\\" The message was sent to all Syrians with subscriptions to the country's two cellphone service providers in the Aleppo area. On the second day of the offensive, there was a growing threat of clashes between the rebels and a Kurdish militia believed to be linked to the PKK. The rebels, who grew suspicious over some Kurdish militants' ties with the government, also threatened to confront groups they said were linked to the PKK in neighboring Turkey. Tawhid Brigade commander Abdul Qader Saleh, requested that the Kurdish militia surrender and \\"not drag themselves into a losing battle that is not their fight.\\" Shortly thereafter, rebels attempted to advance into the Kurdish-held Sheikh Maqsoud district in the north, where they reported capturing eight Shabbiha militiamen. Opposition activists and rebels reported that the Kurdish militia engaged the rebels and fought alongside government troops against the rebel forces in Sheikh Maqsoud. SANA said that district residents were fighting alongside the Syrian army against the rebel offensive. Fighting was reported in central and southern parts of the city. The main points of the rebel attack close to the center were towards the government- held Hamidiya and al-Midan districts. Residents in previously peaceful neighborhoods told AFP that the violence was \\"unprecedented\\", saying \\"The sound from the fighting has been non-stop,\\" \\"Everyone is terrified. I have never heard anything like this before.\\" In the south, rebels advanced through the Izaa, Saif al-Dawla and Sukari districts. Rebel commander Abu Furat said that during the fighting a regular army base was taken in Salaheddine and 25 soldiers were killed before they were forced to retreat. According to one rebel, 20 of their fighters were killed and 60 wounded during the fighting. FSA forces also reportedly suffered heavy losses in the Bdama neighborhood, where a rebel battalion's first lieutenant was killed. Rebels reported that one of their units was surrounded during the clashes, while some other battalions pulled out of the frontline or had never joined the battle. The leader of the Sham Falcon's brigade claimed the rebel fighters were able to progress in al-Arqoub, Maysaloon, Abdulla al-Jaberi square, Hamdaniya and Jamiliya. He said that the Syrian army was using planes and barrels of explosives, and \\"there were ferocious battles in Salehaden and al-Ameriya and al-Sukari. It is a guerrilla war. The Syrian army would come forward 10 metres, we would move forward 50 metres and then if we need to pull back, we pull back.\\" SOHR's Abdel Rahman said, \\"Neither the regime nor the rebels are able to gain a decisive advantage.\\" Rebels claimed to have stormed a government radio station, while government war planes bombed the city's outskirts. A major fire engulfed Aleppo's medieval markets, destroying an estimated 700 to 1,000 shops. A major tourist attraction, the covered markets were among the largest in the Middle East. The rebels blamed the fire on army shelling. According to SANA, clashes took place in al Kalisah, al Firdous, Bab al-Nairab, Bab al-Hadid and Bustan al-Qasr. According to the Irish Times, the rebel offensive had dissolved in a street fight after the Army tenaciously defended its positions. Irish Times and Reuters reported that some rebels units were surrounded and others retreated even before entering the city. According to SANA, the Army was in full control of al-Amiriyah and most of Tal az-Zarazir streets. SOHR said that clashes were taking place in al-Arqoub and Aziziya, while Salaheddine had once again become a focal point. On the third day of the offensive, an activist claimed to CNN that rebels had taken control of at least four neighbourhoods and rebels were reported to have fired mortars at al-Nayrab Military Airport, damaging two helicopters and a main runway. The Syrian government denied that helicopters were destroyed, claiming that those reports were an attempt to raise rebel morale. According to Sana, the Army targeted positions and inflicted losses near the Infirmary and the Sport Institute in Bustan al-Basha and near the Cotton Gins area, east and north of al-Jandoul. Another operation is mentioned near the crossroads of Baleh town, west of Aleppo, with rebel casualties. SANA also said clashes occurred in Qastal Harami, al-Sayyed Ali and Maysaloun Hospital areas. A Turkish fighter, who led an armed rebel unit and its members was reported dead in clashes with the army in al-Tananeer Square. Opposition fighters from the Tawhid brigade and other northern brigades announced that they had partially taken over the Jandoul roundabout in Aleppo. Fighters also said 15 government soldiers were killed and three tanks were destroyed. However, overall, the rebel offensive had stalled and opposition fighters were struggling to hold on to their positions under heavy artillery fire. One rebel described the current situation as 'boring' with the battle becoming yet another stalemate. Rebels blamed the stalemate on their low ammunition and inferior firepower.  Aleppo Square bombings, Old City and Eastern Aleppo fighting  FSA fighters in a firefight in the Ancient City of Aleppo On 1 October 2012, SOHR said that more than 40 were either killed or injured by bombs in the Karm al-Jabal neighborhood in the al-Sha'ar area. Several neighborhoods were bombed including Shakur and Salaheddine. The next day, rebels claimed to have repulsed attacks in Hanano, and that they were in control of most of the Old City in the face of heavy artillery fire. The rebels appeared to be moving towards the city center. The pro-government Lebanese Al-Diyar newspaper announced that Assad had flown to Aleppo by helicopter at dawn and had ordered 30,000 additional government troops and 2,000 personnel carriers from Hama province (army units 5 and 6).Al-Assad visits Aleppo, orders to ‚Äòcrush‚Äô rebels. Hurriyet Daily News. 3 October 2012. Syrian government troops appear to gain upper hand SANA made no mention of any visit. The scene at Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square after the suicide bomb attacks of 3 October 2012 On 3 October, three suicide car bombs exploded at the eastern corner of the central Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square killing 34. More than 122 people were reported to be heavily injured. Islamist militant group Jabhat Al-Nusra claimed responsibility. The bombs targeted the Officers' club and the nearby buildings of the Touristic Hotel and the historic Jouha Caf√©. The hotel received major damage while the caf√© was entirely destroyed. A small building within the Officers' club was ruined as well. Government troops killed two more would-be suicide bombers before they could detonate their explosives. Syrian state TV showed the bodies of three men wearing army uniforms at the bomb site. One of them appeared to be wearing an explosive belt with a timer tied to his wrist. Later, al-Qaeda-linked extremist militant group the Al- Nusra Front claimed responsibility. The group stated that it was carried out by suicide car bombers, followed by attackers disguised as Army soldiers. The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the bombings as a \\"terrorist attack\\". Rebel fighters attacked a political intelligence branch as well as an old vegetable market where a large number of troops were posted, according to the Observatory. Overnight, rebels reportedly destroyed two tanks in the city. The Army battled rebels in several neighbourhoods, including Saif al-Dawla and Sakhur. It also shelled the Bab al-Nayrab, Salaheddine, Mashhad, Bab al-Nasr and Sakhur districts. The fighting led to the destruction of an Army tank and the killing of several Army troops. To avoid and spot snipers, a FSA fighter uses a mirror to see around corners in the Old City in Aleppo On 5 October, state-run Syrian TV said that government forces \\"cleansed Sakhour of terrorists and mercenaries.\\" After days of fighting, an AP correspondent said that the rebels lost control of several buildings in Saif al-Dawla, after close-quarter combat. Meanwhile, rebel fighters claimed to have made advances in the strategic district of Salaheddine, claiming that they had taken the square, lost it and then retaken it after a lengthy battle. An AFP correspondent reported intense street battles in Arkoub district. The insurgents had occupied health facilities and schools as makeshift bases. There were signs of strain from troops, with one officer admitting \\"the battle for Arkoub is as tough as the struggle for Hanano\\" last month. One soldier said he had not returned home once, to Homs, in three months. The neighborhoods of Bustan al-Qasr, al-Helk and al-Haydariya were bombed by Army forces. On 6 October, Syrian state television said that four Turks were among a group of foreign fighters that the army had killed there. Iranian Press TV claimed that the Army had captured the Shakour district, but the FSA said they repulsed the assault after heavy clashes. On 9 October 2012, the FSA captured Maarat al-Numaan. The strategic town lies on the Syria's M5 highway, the main supply route used by the Syrian Army to send supplies and reinforcement from Hama and Damascus to Aleppo, a city under fire between the Army and rebel forces. An AFP correspondent said that the Syrian Air Force was continuously bombing the Bab al-Hadid, Arkub and Shaar neighborhoods that surrounded the besieged Hanano barracks. Locals called it the worst fighting since the battle began. The BBC found a cache of ammunition manufactured in Ukraine and addressed to the Saudi Arabian Army. The ammunition was stored in a mosque used by the rebels. Saudi and Qatari were suspected of supplying ammunition to the rebels but not heavier weapons, such as anti-aircraft missiles, due to American concerns about extremists obtaining such equipment. On 9 October, rebels claimed control of the strategic town of Maarrat al- Nu'man, a town on the Aleppo/Damascus highway from where many of the Army's reinforcements were joining the battle. Seizing the town was believed to be part of a campaign to isolate the Army. On 10 October, rebels launched an attack against the Great Mosque of Aleppo where government forces were based. During four hours of fighting rebels tried to blast holes in the walls of the mosque with RPGs before storming the site but were repelled, leaving rebel snipers to attack the government forces. They had launched an earlier attack against the mosque on 8 October but government forces in the Citadel thwarted them. The government bombarded the districts of Haidariyeh, Sukari and Fardoss at dawn, as fierce fighting broke out in Sakhur, Suleiman al-Halabi and Sheikh Khodr. One hospital in a rebel area admitted 100 patients a day with less than 10 doctors. Veterinarians were used in some cases given a shortage of human doctors. On 12 October, rebel forces seized an air defense base east of the city, near al-Tana village and Koris military airport. After the capture, government air-strikes destroyed most of the rockets and radars at the base. By the end of the day, the rebels were preparing to withdraw, fearing more strikes. On 13 October, a large explosion struck the Air Force Intelligence Directorate office followed by heavy clashes. The Directorate is considered important given Assad's role as commander of the Syrian Air Force in the 1960s. Rebels also broke into the Umayyad Mosque by using an explosive charge to attack government forces stationed there. To avoid Syrian Army soldiers, FSA fighters in Aleppo use tunnels to travel between buildings On 14 October, the Umayyad Mosque was set on fire after Army forces withdrew from it the previous day. Rebels destroyed the southern entrance to get direct access into the internal yard. Later, it was confirmed that the Army's counter-attack recaptured the mosque. The mosque sustained the most damage since an 1822 earthquake struck. A MiG fighter, believed to be a MiG-23, was shot down on 15 October. The pilot ejected and was taken prisoner by rebel forces. On 21 October, \\"a suicide car bomber\\" caused a blast in the New Syriac quarter wounding several people and damaging the Syrian-French hospital and al-Kalima school.  October rebel offensive, Kurdish-Rebel fighting  On 25 October 2012, some 200 rebels moved into Ashrafiyeh district in the Kurdish-controlled area of Sheikh Maqsud. It was the first time that substantial government or rebel forces moved into Kurdish areas. The area had been regarded as neutral with Kurdish militia clashing with both rebel and army units. The rebel unit responsible was allegedly the Liwa al-Tawhid brigade who reportedly told the locals that We are here to spend Eid with you. Ashrafiyeh is important as a part of the city heights and controls routes between the north and south of Aleppo. Previous rebel attempts to move into the district had been repelled. Rebels were reported to have taken control of the Syriac quarter. Analyst Joshua Landis said that according to reports he had received, the Syrian army had retreated from the Aleppo center, allowing the FSA to control the central Christian neighborhoods of Jedida and Qadime. The claims were unverified due to a lack of reporters on the ground. Locals from the Armenian district of Al- Zukur said that the FSA had entered their district leading to clashes. An aide to colonel Riad al-Asaad confirmed the reports of the FSA's recent advances and claimed that the rebels captured the Salaheddine district. The spokesman of the Liwaa al Shabhah brigade claimed that the FSA had limited the Syrian army to five districts. It was unclear whether the rebels had the strength to hold the new areas and there were indications that the rebels had been forced out of some areas by late afternoon, with one resident saying that the government forces were fighting fiercely. On 25 October, one FSA fighter told the Guardian that their main focus was on security branches the Syrian army used as bases. He said that rebels were in the process of besieging the Midan security branch and stopped Army reinforcements from getting to the police school in Khan al-Assal district which had been under FSA siege for 10 days. The fighter claimed that the Ashrafiya take-over by the rebels was the result of a deal with the PKK. SANA said that the Army had recaptured the Syrian- French Hospital. Some rebels believed that the increased talk of a truce from the Syrian government was an effort to stop rebel gains and to use the four days of Eid to reinforce their forces. Later, a rebel commander claimed that the FSA were fighting in Arqoub, Siryan, Zahra and Firqan districts and had secured Suleiman al Halabi. Local activists claimed fierce clashes were occurring around the Airport and that rebels were trying to besiege the Nairab base just south of the city. The center of Aleppo was reported to be in rebel hands with snipers in positions to block counterattacks. The retreat from the city center was seen as either a government trap or signs that the rebel tactic of attacking the government's supply lines was working. Another question was whether the government was prepared to bomb Christian and Kurdish areas, like other rebel-held areas in the past, and risk dragging them into the rebel camp. Rebels who had taken the predominantly Christian areas and Jdeidah, where Lawrence of Arabia once stayed, reported intimidation by the rebels who feared retaliation from both sides in the conflict. The rebels also claimed to have had encircled the Citadel of Aleppo. Rebel activists claimed that Kurdish forces had either reached agreement with rebels to allow their rapid advance or assisted the rebels by simply leaving their checkpoints overnight. One rebel spokesman claimed that Kurdish forces might join the Free Syrian Army. It was reported that government tanks moved into Faisal street, the main thoroughfare running the length of the Christian districts of al- Jadide and Qadime, forcing the rebels to make a tactical retreat back into the Kurdish Ashrafiyya district. The tanks positioned themselves at Ashrafiyeh district the next day, leading some to fear the possibility of the district being shelled, although the tanks did not open fire. However, Kurdish activists claimed that army howitzers shelled Ashrafiyya, leaving 15 people dead including 8 Kurds. Two journalists were among the 15 wounded in the attack. Kurdish activists also accused the Syrian Government of shelling Kurdish buses that were coming from Erfin to Aleppo earlier in the month, causing 15 deaths and 19 injuries. On 26 October, the Syrian authorities accused rebels of breaking the Eid truce. SANA said that rebels opened fire on the Army in several places while the Army responded with fire as well inflicting \\"heavy losses\\" upon the rebels. Mid-day, rebels tried to overrun a checkpoint near the Mohasab army base in the northeast Seryan district. Meanwhile, AFP reported that the Syrian army was guarding the entrance to the Old City. It was also reported that government troops had expelled rebels from the Armenian area of Al-Zukur. Rebels clashed with Kurdish militias that tried to stop them entering the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood. 19 rebels and 5 Kurdish fighters were killed. One Kurdish leader said that they had \\"a gentlemen's agreement\\" with the rebels that they would not enter Kurdish areas and that the rebels had violated it when they entered Ashrafiyeh. According to a report by activists who organised a Kurdish protest at a PYD militant checkpoint between the Kurdish areas of Ashrafiyeh and al-Sheikh Maqsoud, rebel fighters opened fire on the protesters, leaving eight dead and five wounded. Overall, PYD stated that 10 Kurds were killed during the clashes, including three fighters. SOHR put the Kurdish toll at 11, for a total of 30 dead, when including the 19 rebels. 200 people were kidnapped or captured as a result of the fighting. The PYD captured 20 rebel fighters, while the rebels detained 180 Kurds, civilians and fighters. SOHR said that the PYD was still in control of the Ashrafiyeh neighbourhood. A later PYD statement blamed both the Army and the FSA for the violence. \\"We have chosen to remain neutral, and we will not take sides in a war that will only bring suffering and destruction to our country,\\" the statement said. The rebels said that the clashes started after their forces attacked a security compound in Ashrafieh, which was defended by both PKK fighters and government troops. A new report, several days later, put the combatant death toll at 30 rebels and 15 PYD fighters. On 27 October, SANA said that the rebels attacked the water pumping station in Sleiman al-Halabi neighbourhood cutting water from the western part of the city. Rebels were accused of kidnapping Lebanese TV journalist Fidaa Itani because his coverage was considered \\"not suitable\\" for \\"the Syrian revolution and revolutionaries\\". He was later freed by the rebels and left for Turkey. Rebels fanning out West of Aleppo were besieging the Zahra air intelligence base and came under fire from the Ramoussa artillery base which they assaulted from the south. A rebel spokesperson claimed that the Zahra and Ramoussa bases were crucial for the regimes defenses given their lack of manpower. In a new round of clashes in the Kurdish areas, rebels opened fire on Kurdish protesters, killing three of them. The battle for the Zahra air intelligence base was complicated by the possible presence of civilian prisoners.  Rebel capture of bases and fighting in West  On 1 November 2012, a bakery was bombed in Atareb killing at least 12 people. The bakery was important since it delivered bread to 40 towns near Aleppo. The government bombed three other bakeries in and around Aleppo at Kafar Hamra, Ramoon and Qadi Askar. These bakeries were responsible for most of the bread in the area. On 2 November, SOHR incorrectly reported the execution of Shah Ali Abdu, also known as Nujin Derik, the Kurdish militia leader for Aleppo, whom the rebels captured while she was on a mission to return the bodies of rebel fighters killed during the clashes between the FSA and the Kurdish militia. She commanded a unit responsible for protecting the Kurdish districts of Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsud. The report later proved to be false. On 5 November, clashes occurred at a roundabout in Zahraa district, near the city's northwest entrance, and on the road to the airport. In Zahraa a fire started in a building close to air force intelligence branch. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent reported that a fire had burnt down its main warehouse, destroying supplies needed for the upcoming winter. Fighting was reported near the airport. On 11 November, fighting was reported for the first time in the northwest Liramun neighbourhood. SANA claimed that the Syrian army took Al-Sheikh Saeed Area. During the day, the Army pounded rebel positions in the northern area. Rebels began using 'barrel bombs' similar to those dropped on rebel areas by the Air Force in an attack on an army position in Karem Jabal district. They rolled through the sewers underneath the guardpost before being detonated. On 17 November, a car bomb exploded in Liramun. The Syrian Army and the rebels continued to fight in the northwest. On 18 November, rebels stormed the home base of the 46th Regiment in nearby Urum al-Sughra, securing the base the following day in a key strategic victory following a two-month siege. The fall of Base 46 has further isolated government troops fighting in Aleppo as well as in Idlib Province while simultaneously providing the rebels with secure supply routes from the Turkish border and much-needed ammunition and heavy weaponry. The nearby army base at Sheikh Suleiman remained in government hands, though rebel forces had stepped up their attacks on it in the aftermath of Base 46's capture. On 22 November, a building next to a major Aleppo hospital was targeted by an airstrike that killed at least 15 people according to the SOHR, including at least 11 rebels, a doctor and three children. The Dar al-Shifa hospital was a private clinic before it was turned into a field hospital by opposition forces. It has been targeted at least six times in recent months, mainly affecting the upper floors of the seven-story high building. Only 400‚Äì500 yards from the front line it is in a heavily shelled area and one of the few remaining medical clinics for residents in Aleppo. On 26 November, rebels claimed to control most of the roads to Aleppo, leaving the Damascus-Aleppo highway as the only supply route to government forces in the city.Syria rebels close Aleppo ring as France finances opposition 27 November 2012 Syrian rebels take dam, tighten hold on Aleppo 27 November 2012 On 27 November, rebels shot down a Syrian military helicopter on the outskirts of Aleppo using a surface-to-air missile.Fighters in Aleppo say they have shot down a helicopter that belongs to the military's air defence ‚Äì Al Jazeera Blogs Syrian rebels 'shoot down army helicopter' Al Jazeera English On 28 November, the situation in the city's centre was calm with shootings and explosions being heard in the Armenian New Village neighbourhood. It was reported in December that the Bustan al-Basha neighbourhood had been shelled, while the clashes were ongoing on the airport road. On 3 December, clashes were reported in Midan and the nearby Suleiman al-Halabi districts, while government forces shelled villages near the Ground Forces Academy. Activists reported that five bodies had been found in al-Soufayra. However, fierce combat soon broke out within Bustan al-Basha district, held by the Islamist al-Nusra Front and Ahrar ash-Sham groups, according to a military source. The Syrian Army advanced from Midan, taking control of the main avenue and reaching Zahi Hospital in Halak neighbourhood. Islamists continued to hold the side streets and fighting was ongoing.

Abraham married Isabelle de Roore on 16 July 1644. He was a captain of the local schutterij (civil militia) of Antwerp. He was active in the local chamber of rhetoric called the 'Olyftack' ('Olive branch') where he was received as a captain in 1660.J. B.

Like his brother David before him, Abraham found appreciation at the court in Brussels and the art-loving Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria ‚Äì then the governor of the Southern Netherlands and a resident of Brussels ‚Äì appointed him as court painter. Abraham died in Antwerp. Work Drinker and smokers in a tavern General Abraham Teniers is mainly known for his genre scenes which depict themes and are executed in a style not dissimilar to those of his father and brother David who are his presumed teachers. His favorite subjects were villages with peasant dancing or playing music, inns with peasants indulging in drink, food and smoking and monkey scenes. Guardroom Scenes If the attributions by the Prado Museum are correct, Abraham painted two Guardroom Scenes now held in the collection of the Prado Museum.The RKD rejects the attribution of one of the Guard Room Scenes to Abraham Teniers and attributes it to manner of/after David Teniers (II) A guardroom scene is a type of genre scene that became popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders there were also a few practitioners of the genre including David Teniers the Younger, Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu and Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger. A guardroom scene typically depicts an interior scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities.Review of Jochai Rosen, Soldiers at Leisure, The Guardroom Scene in Dutch Genre Painting of the Golden Age at historians of Netherlandish art The first Guardroom Scene attributed to Abraham Teniers depicts a guardroom with a black servant and a pile of weapons, a saddle and a war standard in the foreground and some soldiers gathering around a fire in the background. Guardroom scene In the second Guardroom Scene attributed to Abraham Teniers the guardroom is dominated by the jumble of disjointed metal armours, breast plates, a drum, weaponry and helmets in the foreground while the peasant soldiers smoking a pipe or drinking in front of a fireplace are kept in the shadows in the background of the picture. The armour depicted in the two pictures was already out of date at the time it was painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s.Gillis II van Tilborgh Guardroom scene at Jean Moust It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.Abraham Teniers, Un cuerpo de guardia at the Museo del Prado site Abraham Teniers combined the genres of singerie and guardroom scene in the composition Singerie in a Guardroom now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.Abraham Teniers, Singerie in een wachtpost at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium Singeries Monkeys playing cards Abraham Teniers contributed to the spread of the genre of the 'monkey scene', also called 'singerie' (a word, which in French means a 'comical grimace, behaviour or trick').'Singerie' in Larousse online Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists in particular by those in Antwerp such as Frans Francken the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Elder and the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham. The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders. Later in the 17th century artists like Nicolaes van Verendael, principally known as a painter of flower still lifes started to paint 'monkey scenes' as well.Bert Schepers, Monkey Madness in Seventeenth- Century Antwerp, in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5 Engravings Abraham Teniers was a skilled engraver and is known for his engravings made principally after works of his brother David. An example is the engraving by Abraham of the Village Fair after a design by David.Village Fair at the Rijksmuseum Publishing Smokers and drinkers Abraham Teniers was further active as a publisher. He was responsible for the publication of the Theatrum Pictorium ('Theatre of Paintings'), the project initiated by his brother David to make a set of engravings of the entire art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. As David was the director of this art collection he had conceived this plan but ultimately only a series of 246 plates was produced by several engravers (243 of these represented about half of the Italian paintings then owned by the Archduke). Abraham Teniers published the first edition in 1658 as loose leaves and unnumbered.Theatrum Pictorium at the British Museum Abraham also published prints made by various engravers after the work of his brother David.Abraham Teniers at the British Museum References External links * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish engravers Category:Flemish publishers Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:1629 births Category:1670 deaths Category:Sibling artists ","title":"Abraham Teniers"},{"id":"44950071","text":"A Relic of Old Japan is a 1914 American silent short drama film directed by Reginald Barker and Thomas H.

Nearly ten years on from the Great Recession, notwithstanding that the panic has dispelled and the financial markets have started to recover, there is still no clear evidence of a return to growth in the West. As illustrated in his book, this is not linked to normal oscillations in the economic cycle, but rather is systemic in nature, and in particular is connected to the growing complexity of social organizations (military forces, bureaucracies, health services, education, research). Bonaiuti says the West's failure to return to growth is also linked to the fall in yields of its new tertiary economy as well as to increasing costs of energy and raw materials. In other words, it is a process that is, by nature, progressive and one that takes place over a longer period of time. This would go to explain the impotence and ineffectiveness of remedial measures that have been adopted until today, all born of traditional forms of economic policy.

On 29 January, the bodies of approximately 110 men and boys, most with bound hands and shot in the head were found on the banks of the Queiq River in the western district of Bustan al-Qasr, controlled by rebels. The victims were believed to have been detained, executed and dumped by government forces into the river over a period of several weeks. The bodies floated downstream from a government held portion of the river into a rebel area in Bustan al-Qasr. The bodies only became apparent when winter high water resided in late January. In February, a grate was placed over the river in rebel held territory to help catch other bodies floating down. Between February and mid-March, more than 80 additional bodies were dragged from the river.

On 31 January, government warplanes bombed the Kurdish neighbourhood of Ashrafiyeh, controlled by the Popular Protection Units (YPG), killing at least twenty civilians and injuring 40. Sheikh Maqsoud was also reportedly shelled. Several days prior, on 28 January, a government tank reportedly fired a shell into the Kurdish sector of the city, killing one child and wounding two women. In early January 2013, rebels laid siege to the strategic Police Academy in Khan al-Assal on the western outskirts, which was used by the government to shell nearby areas.Fighting in Syria as world slams Assad speech; Netherlands ships Patriots to Turkey 7 January 2013 On 2 February, Sheikh Saeed district residents confirmed that rebels had taken control of the district after the Army withdrew, allowing the rebels to secure a key route to Aleppo International Airport. Sheikh Said was the last land route between Aleppo and Nayrab airport. Many of the neighbourhood's residents, who were largely loyal to the government, fled when the army retreated. On 24 February, rebels used captured tanks to breach the walls and storm the Police Academy. Rebels took control of several buildings. Fierce clashes reportedly continued thereafter. On 1 March, government forces retook Tel Shghaib village, located southeast of Aleppo. The following day, Army forces seized a road to the besieged airport, creating a new supply route for government forces advancing from Hama. On 3 March, SOHR stated that 120 soldiers and 80 rebels were killed that week in the battle of the Khan al-Asal Police Academy.Rebels 'seize most of Syria police academy' 3-March-13 On 4 March, rebels fully took over the police academy.

The complex had been used to supply the Army with munitions to regularly shell rebel positions in the surrounding area. On 19 March there was a chemical attack in Khan al-Assal, about 15 kilometers west of Aleppo, with about 26 fatalities. It was the first widely reported use of chemical weapons in the war. Both the government and rebels claim that a missile or rocket was used to deliver the agent. The Syrian Information Minister blamed the rebels for the attack, while the rebels blamed the government.William Branigin, Anne Gearan, Suzan Haidamous, \\"Syria, rebels accuse each other of firing a chemical weapon near Aleppo,\\" The Washington Post (19 March 2013). Retrieved 6 May 2013. On the night of 29 March, the opposition Aleppo Media Center claimed that rebel forces had captured Sheikh Maqsoud, which was previously held by both government and Kurdish forces. However, SOHR stated that while rebel forces advanced into the district, they had captured only the eastern part. SOHR also reported that heavy fighting was still ongoing. It was also confirmed that during their advance, rebels had captured and killed the top pro-government Sunni cleric in the district, Hassan Seifeddine. Reports by pro-government Al-Ikhbariya TV and SANA stated he was beheaded and his head was placed on the minaret of the Al-Hassan Mosque. SOHR confirmed that his body had been dragged and paraded in the neighborhood. On 31 March, government troops counterattacked. Fighting was concentrated by the Awarded bridge and in the area between eastern Sheikh Maqsoud and the Bustan al-Basha neighborhood. Since the rebel attack on the district started, 43 people had been killed, including 15 civilians, 19 government soldiers and militiamen and 9 rebels. It was claimed by YPG fighters in Sheikh Maqsoud that following a long discussion within the group, the (mostly Kurdish) YPG decided to end their neutrality in Aleppo and switch to the rebel side, cooperating with the FSA in their advance through the district where several pro-government militias and intelligence officers were located.The Kurdish Factor However, a day later, a YPG political representative denied the claim and stated that the Kurds had not aligned with the rebels, instead that Kurdish forces fought government troops after the Army attempted to reach Arab parts of the district that had been captured by opposition forces, via the Kurdish areas. According to the YPG, as a result of these clashes, which also included artillery, 15 Syrian soldiers and one YPG fighter, YPG military council member Zekeriya Xel√Æl, were killed. On 2 April, clashes erupted in the strategic village of Aziza, on the southern outskirts, from which rebels were launching attacks against Aleppo international airport and the adjacent military air base. By 6 April, the military had captured the village, pushing the rebels to the outskirts. Around 35 people were killed, including at least 18 civilians and 5 rebels. The capture of the village was seen as a strategic victory for the military because it would allow the Army to protect its supply convoys and have a strategic spot from which they could shell rebel positions. On 13 April, nerve gas was reported in Sheikh Maqsood. An anonymous doctor reported three were dead and a dozen wounded. 1,500 doses of atropine were used with a further 2,000 sent by aid agencies. Atropine is a recognised antidote to nerve gases. Situation in Aleppo city, mid-April 2013 By 15 April, rebels had reportedly gained full control of the northern entrance to Aleppo, as well as a factory and a weapons storage facility. On 16 April, the first Aleppo truce was declared. The temporary truce allowed Red Crescent workers to remove 31 decomposing bodies killed in the poor al-Sakhour district located in northern Aleppo. Three of the dead were found with tied hands and four were badly burnt. On 22 April, two Syrian Christian Orthodox Bishops were kidnapped on their return to Aleppo after completing humanitarian work. State media blamed the rebels while the rebels stated, \\"all probabilities are open.\\" On 23 April rebels took control of a key position at the strategic Mennagh Military airbase, allowing them to enter the airbase after a months-long siege. On 24 April, the 11th-century minaret of the rebel- held Great Mosque of Aleppo was destroyed in the fight. Rebels claimed that the Army destroyed the minaret with tank fire to prevent it becoming a sniper position, while the government claimed that it was destroyed by the Nusra Front. On 4 May, the Siege of Menagh Air Base continued amid reports that rebels had made further advances. It was claimed that rebels had killed the base commander and also seized the second military detachment of the base. Rebels claimed that a group of pilots had defected and assassinated the base's commanding officer. The defectors told rebels that around 200 soldiers remained on base, garrisoned in the headquarters building and supported by a handful of tanks. Many soldiers resorted to sleeping under tanks, fearing a rebel assault. On 9 May, it was reported that air strikes forced rebels to retreat from the air base. On 15 May, rebel forces assaulted the main prison in central Aleppo where some 4,000 inmates were held. These include both common and political prisoners. The attack was initiated by twin car bombs at the prison entrance. Rebels secured one compound that housed government forces. The attack bogged down due to the intervention of Syrian tanks and planes. No prisoners were freed. On 16 May, rebels were forced to retreat when soldiers began throwing inmate's bodies out of the windows. It was reported that rebel fighters took control of a building inside the prison after blowing up the main gate. Rebel fighters continued to hit the facility with rockets late into the night.Syrian troops flush out rebels who stormed central prison in northern city of Aleppo In early May, clashes started between rebel groups Ghuraba al-Sham and groups operating under Judicial Committee alliance. The latter accused Ghuraba al-Sham, which was in alliance with Jabhat al-Nusra, of going rogue and looting factories. According to various rebel reports Jabhat al-Nusra started weakening after Nusra leader al- Jolani pledged loyalty to Al-Queda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Before the announcements rebel fighters of various brigades were leaving for Jabhat al- Nusra, in one day about 120 left. Several rebel officials also commented on their disappearance from much of Aleppo. A former government scientist claimed that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons in small quantities to slow rebel advances. Amongst these areas were the Sheikh Maksoud district. The scientist, who worked for Centre for Scientific Studies and Research, claimed that the alleged gas attack on Khan al-Asal, Aleppo, on 19 March 2013, was likely tear gas and not nerve gas. A UNHRC report dated 12 February 2014 concluded that the extremely deadly nerve agent sarin was used in the 3/19 Khan al-Asal attack and that the sarin used in that attack, bore the ‚Äòsame unique hallmarks‚Äô as the sarin used in the 8/21 al-Ghouta chemical attack. On 26 May, 15 inmates were killed, according to SOHR, at the central prison during fighting.At least 15 inmates die in fighting at Syria jail: NGO 28 May 2013 On 1 June, 50 prisoners were reported to have been executed by government soldiers, while a further 31 were killed by the rebel bombardment of the central prison. 40 government soldiers were killed by rebels. On 2 June, a senior commander in the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, said that Assad's forces had called thousands of Hezbollah fighters deeper into Northern Syria, in and around Aleppo, to shore up Assad's overstretched forces and potentially break the stalemate there. It was estimated that around 4,000 Hezbollah fighters responded. Rebels said Hezbollah forces had entered the city on Sunday and were preparing an attack. An unnamed Hezbollah commander stated: ‚ÄúWe are going to go after strongholds where they (the FSA) think they are safe. They are going to fall like dominos.‚Äù The diversion of rebel forces to the Battle of al-Qusayr potentially weakened the rebel grip on Aleppo. On 13 June, in a statement on recent clashes in the province of Afrin, in western Kurdistan, People's Defense Units (YPG) Command said that Turkish soldiers attacked the village of Mele Xel√Æl in Afrin late Wednesday. YPG said, \\"The armed groups which first attacked our forces in the villages of Aq√Æn, Basil and Zarat increased in number as of June 10 when they attacked Meresk and Kefer Mez√™ villages. The armed groups were strongly responded and defeated by our forces\\". The Command remarked that YPG had strengthened its control as armed groups had to withdraw from the region after the clashes one day later. Referring to the Turkish attacks, YPG said \\"Troops of the Turkish military launched an attack against the village of Mele Xel√Æl in Afrin's Cind√™ris district late Wednesday in support of the armed groups targeting the region of Afrin.\\" YPG said Turkish soldiers were repulsed from the region as a result of the response by YPG units.  Operation Northern Storm  On 9 June 2013, the Army announced the start of operation \\"Northern Storm\\", in an attempt to recapture territory in and around Aleppo. In preparation for the assault the Army reinforced the Shiite villages of Al-Nubbul and Zahra which the government intended to use to advance into Aleppo. Rebel defenses in Salamiyeh, south of Aleppo, were strengthened to prevent tanks from moving from that direction. Between 7 and 14 June, Army troops, government militiamen, and reportedly Hezbollah fighters, launched the operation. Over a one-week period, government forces advanced both in Aleppo city and the countryside, pushing back the rebels. However, on 14 June, according to an opposition activist, the tide started reversing, after rebels halted an armoured reinforcement column from Aleppo headed for the two Shiite villages northwest of the city. As of 16 June, the rebels had held back the column for two days. Rebels claimed to have destroyed one tank and killed 20 government soldiers northwest of Maaret al-Arteek. Before the column was stopped, government forces had captured the high ground at Maaret al-Arteek, threatening rebel positions. Rebels were boosted after receiving at least 50 Russian-made Konkurs anti-tank missiles in the previous few days from Saudi Arabia. During 13 June fighting in Aleppo city, government forces temporarily advanced into rebel-held Sakhour district from two directions, but were soon repelled. Situation in Aleppo city, mid-June 2013 On 12 June, FSA fighters claimed to have killed 40 Hezbollah and Syrian army soldiers, who were traveling in buses, in an ambush between the villages of al-Bouz and al- Khanasir. On 17 June, a car-bomb hit an Army facility in al-Douwairinah district, east of the international airport. Jabhat al-Nusra claimed responsibility for the attack. Some opposition activists claimed the attack killed at least 60 troops. However, according to SOHR, only six soldiers were killed and 15 wounded.  Rebel offensive in the West  Approximate situation in Aleppo governorate, June 2013 On 21 June 2013, the FSA said that 13 rebel brigades, amongst them the large Liwa al-Tawhid and the Farouq units, had launched a new offensive. One of the targets was the military research facility in the Rashidin area of New Aleppo. Rebel mortars set it ablaze. The rebels claimed that they were moving forward in Rashidin with the aim of removing military targets including areas used by the army to shell rebel areas. On 23 June, 12 government soldiers were killed by a car bomb while 6 rebels from the Islamist Al-Farouq Brigade were killed. On 24 June, rebels claimed to have repulsed a loyalist attack crediting their victory to newly arrived anti-tank weapons. Aleppo military council leader Colonel Abdul Jabbar al-Oqaidi claimed, \\"The regime pushed forward in the north of the city, but the Free Syrian Army caused a lot of casualties and they went back to their bases.\\" The renewed offensive was called \\"The Battle of Qadisiyah\\", a reference to a battle, from 636 CE, in which an Arab army defeated a Persian army. According to one rebel fighter, the rebels were launching counterattacks in the north east and west of the city, advancing into the agricultural research center. On 25 June, rebels advancing in western Aleppo were reportedly engaging in \\"tit for tat\\" operations against the Army in Rashidin and Ashrafiyeh, according to SOHR. A numbering of people were killed in the shelling of Aleppo Central Prison on 7 July, though who fired the shells was not immediately known. Syrian government forces retained control over New Aleppo despite initial rebel advances in the area, with the opposing sides entrenched sometimes as close as 200 meters to one another. An activist said that an apparent rebel blockade of the southwestern highway was causing fast- emerging food shortages in government-held areas. A rebel source denied that it was intentional, saying that intensified fighting on the highway was to blame, with no vehicle on the highway safe from the fighting. The Southwestern highway is the source of food supplies to western Aleppo, and among the most strategic roads leading into the city. On 17 July, rebel fighters were reportedly making small advances in Salaheddine. On 21 July, reports emerged that rebel fighters had taken full control of the Aleppo suburb of Khan al- Asal, along with the towns of Mataa and Summakiyah, east of the city. Khan Al- Assal was the last government stronghold west of Aleppo, and rebels claimed that seizing it had given them control of the entire Western Aleppo countryside. Unverified video footage showed the body of the Syrian Army's operations commander in Khan Al-Assal, General Hassan Youssef Hassan who rebels of the Al Ansar brigade claimed they killed in clashes. In the video they also displayed his ID card. Both opposition and government sources reported that about 150 government soldiers were killed during the battle, including 51 who were executed after they had surrendered. The executions were reportedly carried out by members of the Al-Nusra Front and the Ansar al- Khalafa al-Islamiya Briagade. By 23 July, some analysts regarded operation \\"Northern Storm\\" to be a feint, since no large-scale offensive was launched by the Army, with the aim of diverting rebel resources to the Aleppo region while government forces escalated their Siege of Homs in an attempt to clear out the remaining rebel hold-outs in the city center. On 31 July, government soldiers attacked rebel positions outside Khan al-Asal after gathering reinforcements for a new assault. On 6 August, rebel fighters took full control of the Menagh airbase after an almost 10 months long siege.http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/06/FSA-takes- control-of-Menagh-air-base-near-Aleppo.html On 16 August, government warplanes bombed the rebel-held Kalassa district, destroying three buildings and killing 15. On 23 August, rebels took control of 13 villages in southern and eastern Aleppo. On 26 August, rebels took control of the strategic town of Khanasir located between Aleppo and Hama province reportedly killing more than 50 pro government fighters. The town was the Syrian Army's only supply route out of Aleppo, and SOHR claimed that its capture had effectively left pro government forces in Aleppo besieged by rebel forces. On 21 September, rebels seized control of several villages south of Aleppo in an offensive aimed at cutting the supply lines of Pro Assad forces from Damascus. On 1 October, 16 militants were killed in an ambush while trying to slip into the Salah al-Din district. A number of other militants were also killed in a separate incident during clashes with the Syrian army in the Ansari district, adjacent to Salah al-Din. On 3 October, the Syrian Army recaptured the strategic town of Khanasir, after a weeks-long battle pitting Syrian troops against rebels, a monitoring group said. Several days later, the supply line to Aleppo was reopened as army troops advanced in the villages around Khanaser. State agency SANA claimed the Army had restored control over 40 villages in the area and engineering units had dismantled insurgent fortifications, about 600 anti-tank mines and 1,500 explosive devices. On 10 October, a rebel advance in Salaheddine led to a large gun battle, which left 10 Syrian government troops dead, along with 6 rebels. On 18 October, 20 soldiers and 7 rebels were killed after rebel groups stormed an air defense facility near the towns of Hujaira and Obaida, southwest of Aleppo.  Battle of Base 80 and Syrian Army advances  Situation around Aleppo from October‚ÄìNovember 2013 On 8 November 2013, before sunrise, the Syrian Army launched an attack against \\"Base 80\\", controlled by the rebels since February 2013, near the Aleppo airport. The Army, backed up by tanks and heavy artillery, unleashed \\"the heaviest barrage in more than a year\\" according to residents in Aleppo. A rebel fighter said, \\"We did not see it coming. The attack came as a real shock to us.\\" According to Al-Jazeera, if the Army captured the base, it would cut the rebel supply routes between Aleppo city and the opposition-controlled town of al-Bab, about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border. By morning, the Army took over several areas of \\"Base 80\\", leaving them in control of large parts of it. Later in the afternoon, rebel forces, including ISIS, received reinforcements and regrouped, after which they attacked the base. During the fighting, two dozen air and artillery strikes struck rebel positions. After dark, rebels counter-attacked and by dawn the next day managed to recapture most of the base, with fighting still occurring around it. During the attack, rebels used GRAD rockets to strike the base. On 10 November, fighting still continued around \\"Base 80\\", with reports of more fighting inside the base itself. During the clashes, rebels targeted two Army armored vehicles, while one rebel tank was destroyed, killing five rebel fighters. By the afternoon, the Army was once again in full control of the base. According to the SOHR, 63 rebels, including at least 11 foreign fighters, and 32 soldiers were killed during the battle. One other report put the number of rebels killed between 60 and 80.Two Danes allegedly die fighting in Syria Army units were backed-up by Hezbollah fighters and pro-government militias during the assault.Syria army retakes key base near Aleppo: state TV Situation in Aleppo city, mid-November 2013 By 11 November, the Army had captured a series of nearby positions, securing most of the area around Aleppo International Airport. On 12 November, government forces, backed by tanks, captured two highrise buildings in the northern Ashrafieh and Bani Zeid districts, and advanced into the two neighborhoods after close-quarter street fighting. On 17 November, Syrian Army troops advanced in the Saif al-Dawlah neighborhood and seized control over a number of sites, with fighting still ongoing in the neighborhood. By mid-December, government forces were reportedly in control of 60 percent of the city, according to the Kurdish news agency Rudaw.  Operation Canopus Star starts  In early December 2013, the Syrian Army launched operation Canopus Star with the aim to encircle Aleppo and cut rebel supply lines into the city, thus besieging rebel-held areas. Between 15 and 28 December 2013, a series of Army helicopter attacks with barrel bombs against rebel-held areas of Aleppo left 517 people dead, including 151 children, 46 women and 46 rebels, according to the SOHR. A rebel commander claimed that by 26 December, more than 1,000 people had been killed in the bombing campaign. On 9 January, aid groups stated more than 700 people had been killed since the start of the bombing campaign. On 20 December, Islamist rebels, including members of the Al-Nusra Front, took control over the Kindi hospital, which had been used by government soldiers as a base for several months. Reuters photojournalist Molhem Barakat was killed during the action. At least 20 regular soldiers were killed and dozens were taken prisoner in the fighting which began after two Al-Nusra fighters detonated themselves at checkpoints guarding the hospital. A few days later, government forces stormed and recaptured much of the Bani Zeid neighborhood on the northeastern outskirts of the city. On 25 December, pro-government sources claimed that the Syrian Army captured the al-Sheikh Maqsoud and al-Jbanat areas of Aleppo city.

Although the railroad aspired to trunk-line status, it was unable to achieve sufficient financing to provide service to two of the three municipalities mentioned in its corporate name. It operated a 52 mile (84 km) route on a northwest to southeast alignment from Huntington to Portland, via Bluffton and Pennville. History Growth The CB&C; was incorporated under the laws of Indiana in 1903, to build a bridge line between Union City and Huntington. At the former place, it would have connected with the Dayton and Union Railroad from Dayton, Ohio which belonged to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway and which would have provided the route to Cincinnati. At the latter place, it connected with the Erie Railroad to Chicago. The company had its offices in Huntington. The complete line would have been 75 miles (121 km) long. The portion from Bluffton to Pennville was opened in 1903, from Pennville to Portland in 1904, and from Bluffton to Huntington in 1908. In that same year, the company became insolvent and a receiver was appointed. Construction was in hand on the section from Bluffton to Union City, but this was never completed.Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities 1908 p. 286 However the company obtained useful minerals traffic revenue by opening a pair of spurs, one of two miles (3.2 km) from Pennville to a gravel pit, and the other of a mile (1.6 km) from Markle to a stone quarry.Poor's Manual of Railroads 1915 p. 1305 Decline In 1910, the receiver defaulted on promissory notes that he had issued and, as a result, the company was foreclosed and the railroad ordered to be sold at auction at a minimum price of $800 000. After no bids at this price were received, in 1912 a new company entitled the Huntington, Richmond and Hamilton Railway was formed to take over the line, but this did not proceed.Poor's Manual of Railroads 1915 p. 1305 This was an electric Interurban proposal, which would have completed the unfinished line to Union City and extended on new track to Richmond.Mariette, J:Electric Railroads of Indiana 1980 p. 170 The CB&C;'s financial condition worsened significantly with a pair of accidents in 1913. On May 22, 1913, a freight train fully loaded with masonry stone was passing over one of the small railroad's key assets, a trestle bridge over the Wabash River at Bluffton, when the overburdened span collapsed. The mishap threw the steam locomotive into the river, killing the engine driver. Later that year on December 13, a crew had braked one of the railroad's remaining steam locomotives for the night at the short line's northern terminus, Huntington. The track apparently sloped and the locomotive slipped its brake and ran away after working hours. Overshooting the CB&C;'s trackage stub, the power unit crossed a downtown street and buried itself in the plate-glass front window of a small downtown grocery store. There were no known casualties. A photograph of the incident survives.

Between 15 and 28 December 2013, a series of Army helicopter attacks with barrel bombs against rebel-held areas of Aleppo left 517 people dead, including 151 children, 46 women and 46 rebels, according to the SOHR. A rebel commander claimed that by 26 December, more than 1,000 people had been killed in the bombing campaign. On 9 January, aid groups stated more than 700 people had been killed since the start of the bombing campaign. On 20 December, Islamist rebels, including members of the Al-Nusra Front, took control over the Kindi hospital, which had been used by government soldiers as a base for several months. Reuters photojournalist Molhem Barakat was killed during the action.

At the same time, government troops pushed out of Kweires military airport, east of Aleppo and the station, and captured villages around the base. On 16 January, the Army made slow progress in the neighborhood of Bani Zeid, while the rebels captured two buildings in the Saif Al-Dawla district.

On 24 February, the Army made progress in the Sheikh Najjar industrial zone, with rebels sending reinforcements to the area. The military was attempting to capture strategic areas in Sheikh Najjar that overlook the outskirts of the Aleppo central prison, which had been under a rebel siege for over a year. The Army hoped to station artillery at those positions to help fend off attacks on the prison. The next day, the military captured the factory of the Zanoubia ceramic company in the southern al-Sheikh Sa'id district of Aleppo. Soldiers, NDF militiamen and Hezbollah fighters also captured new positions near Base 80, putting them one kilometer from the Tariq al-Bab district. By 9 March, government forces had captured a strategic hill, where they positioned artillery to bombard rebel positions around the prison. The Army had also reportedly captured the eastern Hanano district of Aleppo city and was planning to open a new road that would link Hanano and the industrial zone, after it is captured, thus imposing a blockade on the city. On 18 March, rebels detonated an \\"explosive device\\" in a tunnel under the Justice Palace. The rebels claimed to have seized the old Justice Palace after the blast.  Offensives and counter-offensives  On 23 March 2014, rebels captured Kafr Hamra, the Shweihneh strategic hill overlooking west Aleppo and briefly cut off the supply route to Aleppo airport before government troops found another supply route.

On 28 April, rebels and the Syrian government reached a deal in Aleppo and electricity was returned in western Aleppo, after the rebels cut it for ten days, in exchange for a cessation of airstrikes by the Army. This agreement appeared to be holding on 30 April, despite minor violations. However, it was later reported that the Syrian Airforce bombed The Ein Jalout school and killed at least 20 people, including 17 children. By the end of the day, electricity to western Aleppo was completely cut off again. On 29 April, the Army managed to consolidate its control over al-Ramouseh district.

Prison siege broken and Sheikh Najjar captured  On 20 May, the Army captured the Sheikh Najjar power plant and Agop hill right next to it, which opened the way towards the central prison, bringing government troops to one kilometer from the prison complex. There were also reports that some troops had already arrived to reinforce the prison. After the capture of the hill, the military attacked the village of Hilan, which is the last rebel stronghold before the prison. The Army was also still engaged in Sector 2 of the industrial complex. The next day, the military captured Hilan, as government forces had broken through on the road leading to the prison. At the same time, rebels blew up the Kindi hospital in fear it could be used for monitoring rebel supply routes if the advancing government troops managed to capture it. Soon after, Army tanks had reached and taken up positions at about 500 meters from the prison complex. The area was witnessing heavy artillery shelling, with government troops dropping at least 30 barrel bombs from military helicopters over the previous 24 hours, as rebel forces were fast retreating from the area due to the government's superior firepower. During the two days of fighting, at least 50 rebels were killed. On 22 May, the Army had finally broken the siege of the prison as tanks and armored vehicles entered the complex.http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/05/22/Syrian- troops-reach-besieged-Aleppo-prison.html The Air Force dropped more than 100 barrel bombs during the final push to reach the prison.Syrian Troops Reach Besieged Prison In Aleppo This puts the north-east approach to Aleppo under the control of government forces. At this point, for the first time, an Army reconnaissance squad entered one of the streets of the eastern Masakin Hanano district. By 25 May, the military was in control of most of the industrial zone north east of Aleppo, except a northern section, and had captured the town of Jbeileh next to the prison. By 8 June, the army had completely secured the industrial city which had been organized as a fortress by the rebels, who planted mines and dig dozens of tunnels in the area. It was reported that hundreds of rebels blew themselves up rather than surrendering. On 31 May, a number of buildings near the market Zahrawi in old Aleppo were damaged by a 'tunnel-bomb' according to a YouTube video uploaded by the Islamic Front. The rebels alleged the attack had resulted in casualties among the Army ranks. The SOHR claimed at least 20 soldiers were killed in the blast, while Islamic Front claimed to have killed 40. On 4 July, the Army took control of the Sheykh Najjar industrial area and two days later captured the town of Kafr Saghir northeast of Aleppo, bringing the distance between Army-held areas and the rebel-held Infantry School to just one town. With this, the rebel's situation deteriorated as the Army was close to severing all supply routes to opposition-held districts of Aleppo.  Rebel counter-attacks repelled, continued Army advance  On 29 July, at least 13 Syrian Army personnel were killed by two tunnel-bombs under a police station building near Aleppo Citadel. By mid-August, only three miles remained before the military could completely cut rebel supply lines into the city, after the opposition forces‚Äô position deteriorated in the previous month following failed rebel counterattacks that attempted to dislodge government troops from the industrial zone. The rebels also attempted to capture the military academy in the western outskirts of the city, in an attempt to force government forces to reposition from the east to the west. However, the attack ended in catastrophe after the rebels were exposed to repeated air strikes, even at night, that made it impossible to move men and weapons freely. Government forces had also captured two hills and three villages in the western Aleppo countryside, while there were competing claims over the town of Khan Tuman.SYRIA DIRECT: NEWS UPDATE 8 June 2014 On 18 August, the Army captured Khan Tuman hill.  Renewed Army offensive north of the city  On 3 October, the Syrian Army, backed by NDF fighters, captured the town of Handaraat and Handaraat Hill, thus placing the rebel-held districts of Aleppo under siege. Syrian army fights for last major rebel route into Aleppo. Reuters. 3 October 2014 On 9 October, the Army claimed to had captured the Handarat farms and the village of Babinnis, just south of the rebel-controlled infantry school. On 11 October, rebels advanced in the neighborhood of al-Rashedin where they took control over some buildings. Two days later, they also advanced in Suleiman al-Halabi area near Hanano Barracks and in the village of Saifat. On 13 October, according to the SOHR, rebels made advances that could possibly cut off the supply roads to the Army-held Sifat, Handarat and Handarat base. On 18 October, the Army captured the village of al-Jbayleh and the cement plant, north of the Central Prison of Aleppo, ending the rebel's attempts to isolate the Army in Sifat and Handarat. They also captured the Aleppo Glass Factory and the next day seized the village of Al-Muslimiyya. On 9 November, an UN envoy arrived in Syria to tour camps and lay out a ceasefire proposal for Aleppo. The proposal reportedly included the districts of Hanano, Bani Zaid, Salahaddine, Al-Ramouseh, Handarat, Sheikh Saeed and Al-Layramoun where the Syrian Army and the Islamic front would adhere to a ceasefire. The latter would then disarm and be safely transported to the Syrian-Turkish border. The ceasefire proposal was rejected by rebels by 13 November 2014 though. On 17 November, according to a Turkish media source, Jamal Marouf, the leader of the FSA in Aleppo, fled to Turkey, withdrawing with him over 14,000 Opposition troops. As a result, the FSA lost control over the Bab al-Hawa border gate with Turkey, which is now under Ahrar al-Sham control. On 24 November, according to Almasdar the SAA's entry in east Aleppo was coupled with their success at the Al-Jandoul Roundabout, where the latter forced the Islamic Front to retreat from the main road connecting the Al-Jandoul Roundabout and Al-‚ÄòAweeja. The success at the Al-Jandoul Roundabout led to the SAA's entry into east Aleppo and if the latter captures the Hanano District; it will disrupt the Islamic Front's supply route into the east. The army had also checked an attempt by the al-Nusra Front to enter the villages of Nubl and az-Zahra. The Nusra Front lost at least 179 militants between 23 and 28 November. By the end of November, the Army had established control over 80% of al-Oweija, parts of Hanano and most of Handarat. On 7 December, the army secured a fresh advance, taking the area of Breij northeast of the city of Aleppo and killing at least 24 rebels and jihadis. The next day, the army advanced around Handarat and managed to control al-Breij, al-Hajal, al-Majbal districts in Aleppo with overlooking on Hanano, Haydariya and Duwayr al- Jandul. On 9 December, SAA, Ba‚Äôath Brigades and NDF entered the Al-‚ÄòOweeja and Baya‚Äôadeen districts. On 11 December, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) ‚Äì backed by the National Defense Forces (NDF) and Al-Ba‚Äôath Brigades (Liwaa Al-Ba‚Äôath) ‚Äì stormed the Stone Quarries in southern Al-Bureijj, killing a number of militants from the Islamic Front (Jabhat Al-Islamiyya) and retaking ground captured by the latter in the previous week. The SAA and its allies were able to fight past the Stone Quarries and continue their push south towards the strategic Hanano District in Aleppo. The Islamic Front suffered significant casualties at Al-Bureijj over the previous seven days, estimated at more than 60 killed. In Al-Amariya, the NDF detonated explosives under a building housing some 40 Ahrar ash-Sham militants, possibly killing dozens. On 13 December, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the hell cannon, a mortar-like improvised weapon used by the opposition, has killed over 300 civilians with most of them in Aleppo. On 14 December, the Army advanced into and captured the al-Mallah area, with further attempts by the military to capture the area west of al-Mallah and thus finally cut the Castello Road. Government forces also advanced and captured the southern and western parts of the Handarat city district, closing in on Handarat hill which overlooks the Castello Road. 34 rebels and nine soldiers were killed during the day. On 26 December Syrian Air Force planes and helicopters dropped multiple barrel bombs north-east of Aleppo killing 40 people. On 30 December a tunnel bomb by new opposition group Jabha Shamiyeh in the Old City killed and wounded 20 government soldiers.

His life and violent death led to ongoing conflicts in his home town and have been depicted in movies and books.  Background  Pius Walder was the youngest of twelve children, born in the family of Josef Walder from Innervillgraten and his wife Anna Senfter from Au√üervillgraten. Walder's home community is a Streusiedlung with various farms spread out on the Kirchweiler Kalkstein in the Tauern mountains at an altitude of . The Villgraten valley is a tributary of the Pustertal. The western and eastern borders of the community border the S√ºdtirol in Italy. The valley is one of the most remote regions in Austria; year-round access was only established in 1956. Walder never married. He was a lumberjack by trade and he and his brothers were also poachers. On September 8, 1982, he was observed at dusk with blackened face and carrying a rifle, and was shot by Johann Schett, a forester and state hunter. Schett was later sentenced to three years in prison for K√∂rperverletzung mit t√∂dlichem Ausgang (a lower grade of manslaughter) and was released after 18 months. The comparatively lenient sentence was viewed with contempt by Walder's family.  Death and aftermath  Walder family grave in Kalkstein The forester Johann Bergmann said that he had heard shots on 8 September and alerted his colleagues Schett and Schaller. They spotted Walder more than away. They called to him and when he tried to run away, Schett shot him in the back of his head. However, Walder's gun had not been used that day. Walder's brother assumed that the hunters had killed him on purpose. Walder's gravestone and the death notice refer to his death as murder. The gravestone bears the claim: Ich wurde am 8. September 1982 in Kalkstein von zwei J√§gern aus der Nachbarschaft kaltbl√ºtig und gezielt beschossen und vom 8. Schuss t√∂dlich in den Hinterkopf getroffen (On September 8, 1982, I was shot in Kalkstein by two hunters from the neighborhood, in cold blood and deliberately, and the 8th shot hit the back of my head with deadly force). In 2012 one of the Walder brothers disturbed the burial of Schett 30 years later with loud accusations of murder. About 1,000 guests were present at Walder's burial.Simon Rosner: Der unselige Schuss. In: Wiener Zeitung. 7. September 2007. When the local priest wanted to remove the death notice with the murder accusations from the church, he was beaten by a Walder brother, a turning point in the local community as the brothers began to lose a lot of sympathy then.Siegfried Becker, Andreas C. Bimmer (Hrsg.): Mensch und Tier: kulturwissenschaftliche Aspekte einer Sozialbeziehung. Jonas Verlag, Marburg 1991, . The brothers had a further quarrel with Bergmann at a further burial, Bergmann had to be treated in a hospital, and the brothers were convicted and had to pay large fines.  Further coverage  In the local community, the Walder brothers grew more and more isolated because of their violent behavior. Pius' grave and various sites of his life and death attracted tourists, and various media reported on the ongoing quarrels.

Tatort is the longest-running German-language television series of that sort, set in various parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The series is being broadcast in these countries as well in Scandinavia. The film used some of the aspects of the Walder case and used the phrase Elvis lebt!

Sociologist Roland Girtler wrote a study of Walder's death in a \\"cookbook for poached game\\".Roland Girtler, Eva Bodingbauer: Wilderer-Kochbuch. Mit Durchschuss, B√∂hlau Verlag, Wien 2004, Girtler saw the case as evidence of a change in attitude towards poaching - while poachers had strong local support until the early 20th century, Walder's case showed a significant change in attitudes. Urban citizens still had some sympathy for the hillbilly rebel, while the local community were much less in favor.Roland Girtler: Wilderer ‚Äì Soziale Rebellen in den Bergen. B√∂hlau, Wien 1998, .

In particular his work can be seen on calvaries and in the church's south porch. He was born in 1616 and died in 1660. Little detail of his life is known but it is recorded that he practised as an architect in Landerneau, as well as running his workshop, and was recorded as calling himself the \\"Sculpteur du Roi\\" (The King's sculptor). His works, all of an ecclesiastical nature, are mainly located in L√©on and the north of Cornouaille. They can be taken as works by Dor√©'s workshop rather than just by Dor√© himself. Brittany is particularly rich in calvaries, some of a very elaborate nature. In most cases the calvary involves both the crucifixion cross and side crosses or gibbets bearing the good and the bad robbers. Below this, on the crosspieces, were statues of those present at the crucifixion. A feature of Breton calvaries is that most of the statues were carved as a pair (g√©min√©es in French) and effectively back to back. Dor√©'s output was prodigious and he worked on nine monuments in Saint-Th√©gonnec, five in Logonna-Daoulas and four in the parish of Plougastel-Daoulas. He also received four commissions to work in Hanvec, three in Guiclan, Irvillac and Lampaul- Guimiliau and two commissions in Cl√©den-Cap-Sizun, H√¥pital-Camfrout, Landerneau, La Martyre, Plabennec, Pleyben, Plogonnec, Saint-Nic, Saint- Servais and Saint-Urbain. Main works Brittany is divided into five regions, C√¥tes-d'Armor, Finist√®re, Ille et Vilaine, Loire Atlantique and Morbihan. Dore's works will here be recorded per region and for Finist√®re a further subdivision into its arrondissements of Morlaix, Ch√¢teaulin, Quimper and Brest. Works by Dor√© in the Arrondissement of Brest Dor√© is attributed with the following works in the Brest arrondissement. H√¥pital-Camfrout For the √âglise Notre-Dame de Bonne Nouvelle in H√¥pital-Camfrout, Dor√© sculpted a Christ sauveur and also worked on the Croix du Run and the Calvaire de Troan. Plabennec The Locmaria-Lan chapel in Plabennec holds a Dorƒó statue of the Virgin Mary and Child in a niche in the bell-tower and the atelier are credited with carving the crucifix on the Calvaire de Scaven. Virgin Mary and child/Locmaria-Lan chapel La Martyre La Martyre's Croix de Kerlavarec, of which only the shaft of the cross remains, is attributed to Dorƒó. Plougastel-Daoulas In Plougastel-Daoulas, the Dor√© atelier executed statues for the Saint-Gu√©nol√© chapel's calvary which has the date 1654 inscribed on the pedestal supporting the cross. The statues are of Gu√©nol√© reversed with the Virgin Mary, the crucifix reversed with the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus and Saint Peter reversed with John the Evangelist. Cottet's 1903 painting of women in Plougastel-Daoulas La Forest- Landerneau Some stairs separate the upper part of the cemetery in La Forest-Landerneau from the lower section and these are decorated with Dorƒó sculptures of a saint in bishop's attire and Catherine of Alexandria. Plouvien The Dorƒó atelier worked on a statue of Saint Jaoua for the fountain by Plouvien's Saint Jaoua chapel. The Saint Jaoua chapel fountain Le Conquet There is a statue of Saint Francis of Assisi in the choir area of the ƒñglise Saint Derrien in Le Conquet. Tr√©fl√©v√©nez In Tr√©fl√©v√©nez, in the √âglise Saint-Pierre there is a Dor√© sculpture of Saint Margaret and the dragon. It is located on the south wall of the south aisle. Le Tr√©hou In the south porch of the Sainte-Pit√®re parish church in Le Tr√©hou, the Dor√© atelier executed statues of Saint Peter, Saint Andrew, John the Evangelist and Saint Thomas as well as the Christ sauveur which is placed on a pedestal. Statues in the √âglise Sainte-Pit√®re at Le Tr√©hou Lannilis In 1630, Dor√© worked on the calvary at Kerosven in Lannilis. He sculpted Christ on the cross and statues of John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary. Le Folgo√´t For the Le Folgo√´t Croix du Champ de foire, the Dorƒó atelier carved the crucifix and a shield with depictions of Jesus' pierced and bleeding hands, feet and heart, and for the parish church Dor√© executed a statue of \\"Christ souffrant\\". Dirinon There is a calvary called \\"La Croix-Rouge\\" at Dirinon which has Dor√© statues of Christ on the cross and back to back statues depicting John the Evangelist /Saint Roch and the Virgin Mary/Saint Sebastian. Logonna-Daoulas Outside the \\"Chapelle Saint-Jean-Baptiste\\" at Logonna-Daoulas, there is a fountain dating to 1644 with a sculpture depicting John the Baptist which is attributed to Dor√©. Nearby, another fountain, the \\"Fontaine de saint Jean l'√âvang√©liste\\" with its sculpture depicting John the Evangelist dates to 1647 and is also attributed to Dor√©. Inside the chapel itself, the polychrome statue of St. Laurent is also a Dor√© work. In the same area of Logonna-Daoulas it was Dor√© who was responsible for the Croix de Ruliver and the Croix de Cl√©m√©n√©hy. See various photographs below. In 1647 Dor√© executed a statue of John the Baptist for a niche in a nearby fountain at Goelet-ar-C'hoat.

It carries statues by Dor√© of John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary, apart from Jesus on the Cross. Saint- Renan On the Saint-Renan \\"Croix de Quillimerrien\\" is a statue of the Virgin Mary which is attributed to the Dorƒó atelier. \\"La croix du Cranou\\" This calvary in the Cranou forest near Hanvec has sadly lost its cross. It dates to 1627. It had served the Saint-Conval chapel which is now in ruins. Irvillac At Irvillac there is a fountain by the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette chapel with a calvary by Dor√©. This dates to 1644 and whilst the figure of Christ has been mutilated and lost both arms and legs, the back to back (\\"g√©min√©es\\") statues of the Virgin Mary/Saint Peter and John the Evangelist/Saint Yves have survived, as have the depictions of the two robbers crucified with Jesus. The calvary is known as the \\"Coatnan\\" calvary. At Irvillac, Dor√© also worked on the calvary by the Locm√©lar chapel and also worked on a statue of Saint John in the sacristy of the Irvillac √âglise Saint- Pierre.

This features Christ on the cross, a mutilated depiction of a saint and statues \\"g√©min√©es\\" of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter which are also badly damaged. Saint-Urbain, Finist√®re This calvary erected in 1550, was restored by Dor√© in 1630 and is located by the Chapelle Notre-Dame in Tr√©varn, Saint-Urbain. It has depictions both of Christ on the Cross and Christ aux liens (Christ sitting awaiting his crucifixion). Many calvaries in Brittany were erected to celebrate the end of an outbreak of plague and the shaft of the Tr√©varn Calvary is decorated with small extrusions or bumps intended to mimic the boils which were a sign of the bubonic plague (\\"bubons\\"). Another calvary near Saint Urbain was restored by Dor√© in 1630 and that is the calvary at Quinquis. Erected in 1518 and having a height of 5 metres, the depiction of Christ on the Cross is backed by a Piet√†. Works by Dor√© in the Arrondissement of Morlaix Dor√© is attributed with the following works in the Morlaix arrondissement. Cl√©der The Dorƒó atelier executed the crucifix on the Croix de Kerzuoc'h in Cl√©der. Plougonven Dor√© completed a statue of Saint Joseph for the Plougonven parish church, the √âglise Saint-Yves. It can be seen in the north part of the nave. The statue had originally been in the Kerloaguen chapel. The saint holds a palm leaf in one hand and a closed book in the other. Plougourvest In Plougourvest, the Dor√© atelier executed a statue of the Virgin Mary for the exterior of the south porch of the √âglise Saint-Pierre and the statues Christ glorieux and that to Saint James the Greater inside the porch. Statue of James the Greater Guiclan In the south porch of the Guiclan parish church is a Dor√© sculpture of Christ on the cross which came from Kerizamel. At Kerlaviou there is a badly mutilated calvary which dates to 1622 and has been attributed to Dor√©, and at Pen-ar-Feunteun there is another Dor√© calvary. This dates to 1642 and was restored in 1889 by Larhantec. The back-to-back statues depict John the Evangelist reversed with an unidentified saint and the Virgin Mary reversed with Saint Catherine. Pleyben The 1625 calvary in Pleyben depicts Jesus on the cross and below him John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary. In 1929, Saint Yves and Saint Genevi√®ve were added as well as a sculpture of St Edern riding a stag, known as the \\"Kroaz-Edern\\" calvary. In the porch of the √âglise Saint Germain in Pleyben are statues of the apostles of which Dor√© sculpted that of James the Greater and John the Evangelist. There are also the remains of a calvary by the Dorƒó atelier in the √âglise Saint Germain ossuary. Saint-Sauveur, Finist√®re The Saint-Sauveur, Finist√®re, cross dates to 1630 and is located in the cemetery at Kerbouzard. The calvary is high. Ploun√©our-M√©nez For the south porch of the Saint- Yves church in Ploun√©our-M√©nez, Dor√© executed two statues of John the Evangelist and Saint Thomas. He also worked on part of the calvary with back- to-back statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter and John the Evangelist and Saint Paul. The atelier also worked on the Kersimonet cross executing a statue of the Virgin Mary with child. Finally in Ploun√©our-M√©nez, the Dorƒó atelier are credited with execution of a calvary at the \\"manoir du Penhoat\\". On the fountain there Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint James the Greater's statues are all that remain of a calvary. Enclos paroissial de Saint-Th√©gonnec Vue g√©n√©rale de l‚Äôenclos paroissial de Saint-Th√©gonnec This is one of Finist√®re's most visited sights. The enclos at Saint-Th√©gonnec, surrounded by a retaining wall (mur d‚Äôenceint), comprises a grand entrance (porte triomphale), an ossuary, a calvary and the parish church of Notre-Dame. Dor√©'s statue of St John inside this church dates to 1625 and is one of the rare occasions when Dor√© signed his work Inside the church Dor√© also carved the statues in the belltower porch, this in 1625. The top of the calvary has a cross depicting Jesus whilst the crosses of the two robbers are placed on two columns rising up from the base of the calvary. Four angels surround Jesus' cross collecting his blood in chalices. Two do so from the wounds to his heart and hands and the other two collect the blood from his feet. On the first crosspiece (croisillion) are statues of two cavaliers on horseback, one of whom, Saint Longinus, was the soldier who pierced Jesus' side with a lance. These stand on either side of the reverse side of the cross which depicts Christ leaning on the column where he was whipped (\\"Christ √† la colonne\\"). On the next crosspiece are statues (gemin√©es or back to back) of John the Evangelist and Saint Yves and the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter these on either side of a depiction of Mary with child and a Piet√†. On the base of the calvary are representations of different scenes from the Passion and the Resurrection; the descent from the cross, the burial and the resurrection. We then have sculptures showing Jesus being tied up, Jesus blindfolded and being manhandled by two soldiers, Jesus being whipped, an \\"Ecce Homo\\", Pontius Pilate washing his hands after passing sentence on Jesus, Jesus meeting Veronica whilst carrying the Cross, and in a small niche, a statue of St Th√©gonnec and his cart. All this was the work of \\"Le Ma√Ætre de Saint-Th√©gonnec\\" in 1610 and several years later Dor√© was to add the depiction of Christ being mocked. The figures wear the dress of the reign of Henry IV. Dor√© also worked on the nearby \\"Calvaire de Broustou\\" in 1632 and the \\"Croix de Pennavern\\". The \\"Calvaire de Broustou\\" is 4 metres high and the Pennavern cross has a height of 5 metres and dates to 1647. Dor√© also worked on the south porch of Saint- Th√©gonnec's √âglise Notre-Dame. There is also a Dor√© sculpture at Le Kelf where there is a depiction of the Virgin Mary in a small niche. This dates to 1652. Another calvary at Coslen was restored by Dor√© in 1622.

Saint-Servais The calvary at the Saint-Servais enclos The enclos at Saint-Servais in Finist√®re is known for the quality of its bell tower and ossuary. Saint-Servais had been part of Ploun√©venter but became an independent commune in 1792. Of the sculptures on the calvary only the crucifix and the Christ aux liens are by Dor√©. Also at Saint-Servais the \\"Croix de Brƒóti√®s known as the Croas-Vossoc is by Dorƒó. The calvary has a crucifix and a shield inscribed \\"IAC BRAS 1640\\". Eglise Saint-Pierre de Pleyber-Christ In the south porch of Pleyber-Christ's Saint Pierre church we see a depiction of Christ and the twelve apostles. The church has been declared a \\"Monument Historique\\" since 1914 and is rich in furnishings. The apostles appear in niches in the porch and above the door, Dor√© was responsible for all the statues of Jesus and the apostles. For the Kervern calvary known as the \\"Croix de Kervern\\", the Dorƒó atelier executed statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Marguerite. File:Pleyber-Christ 4 Porche six statues d'ap√¥tres.JPG|The statues of six of the apostles File:Pleyber-Christ 5 Porche Les six autres statues d'ap√¥tres.JPG|The other six apostles Bodilis Bodilis is one of the communes of the arrondissement of Morlaix. It lies six kilometres northwest of Landivisiau. In the \\"Enclos paroissial de Bodilis\\", the √âglise Notre Dame, Dor√© executed the statue of Notre Seigneur b√©nissant (Christ sauveur) which stands in the south porch as well as the Angel of the Annunciation placed in a niche in the left side buttress of that porch. In the Angel of the Annunciation composition, Dorƒó includes a vase of lilies which is inscribed \\"ECCE:ANCILLA:D(OMI)NI:FIAT:MIHI:SECVNDVM:VERBVM:TVVM\\". He also sculpted the elaborate hexagonal baptismal font which he decorated with sculptures of Matthew the Apostle, Mark the Apostle, God holding his dead son in his arms, St Gregory the Great, John the Evangelist, Saint Peter and the bishop St Ambrose of Milan. All the Bodilis works were carved from kersanton stone. See Bodilis Parish close. The fountain at the Pont an Ilis situated in the \\"Kerrous\\" district of Bodilis includes Dor√©'s 120 cm sculpture of the Virgin Mary and because the sculptor used the dark stone Kersanton, it became known to local people as the \\"Vierge Noire\\" (the black virgin) Lampaul- Guimiliau The commune of Lampaul-Guimiliau has two calvaries attributed to Dor√©. One, with a height of , is known as the \\"Cosquer-Bihan\\" or \\"Croaz- Kern√©vez\\" and dates to 1621. It is a wayside cross (Croix de chemin) and thought to be one of Dor√©'s early works. It depicts Jesus on the Cross and on the reverse depicts the Virgin Mary with child. The second located at Kerjaffr√®s is known as the \\"Croaz-Kerroc'h\\" and dates to 1626. Commana, L'√©glise Saint-Derrien This \\"enclos\\" church in Commana has two calvaries, one by Dor√© dating to 1624 and being high. It is carved from kersantite and the paired statues on the crosspiece below the figure of Christ on the Cross depict St Yves/ St Herv√© as well as the Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist and a Piet√†. It is located in the √âglise Saint-Derrien cemetery and is inscribed The \\"Enclos paroissial de Commana\\" is a good example of a Breton enclos with the parish church, surrounded by a wall and an elaborate entrance. As well as the church, the enclos would include a funeral chapel or ossuary and one or more calvaries, either placed in the cemetery or just outside the church. The Saint-Derrien church has an imposing porch and bell tower and inside the church, the Sainte Anne altarpiece is one of many highly regarded works of ecclesiastical art, and the church has a noteworthy baptismal font with decoration by Honor√© Alliot. The entrance to the enclos is an elaborate Arc de Triomphe. On the exterior of the south porch there is a statue of Saint Derrien which is attributed to the Dorƒó atelier.

At the base of the pedestal supporting the Cross is the piet√† \\"Notre-Dame de Piti√©\\", with a sword bearing the image of the resurrected Christ on the reverse side. Lann√©dern The ankou, part of the decoration of the Lann√©dern ossuary The Calvary at Lann√©dern dates to 1625 and is located in the hamlet of Birilit. Lann√©dern itself has an interesting enclos and it's ossuary has a good example of the Ankou, two in fact. See photograph. Also see Note 2 below. Din√©ault There is a calvary in the church enclos of the \\"bourg\\" of Din√©ault, which lies northwest of Ch√¢teaulin. The statues on the calvary include Christ on the cross placed back to back with a depiction of Christ suffering (Christ aux liens), these by Dor√© and dating to 1648. Records show that the other figures were added later. Cast, Finist√®re The small commune of Cast, Finist√®re, lies between Ch√¢teaulin and Douarnenez some north of Quimper and the √âglise paroissiale Saint-J√©r√¥me in the Rue Kreisker. It has a 1660 Calvary attributed to Dor√© which carries the inscription It is high and at the base of the pedestal is a depiction of Saint Tujan and a Piet√† (Vierge de Piti√©) whilst on the crosspiece are statues depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene and Saint Peter. The √âglise Saint J√©r√¥me has a Dorƒó sculpture of Saint Mark with his attribute the lion in a niche on the western fa√ßade and a statue of the Virgin Mary with child in a niche in the south porch.

The Calvary outside the Eglise paroissiale Saint- J√©r√¥me Plon√©vez-Porzay The calvary of Sainte-Anne-la-Palud The commune of Plon√©vez-Porzay lies north of Quimper and Dor√© executed the calvary of Sainte-Anne-La-Palud. Just high, it is thought to date from between 1630 and 1656. On the side opposite Jesus on the cross is a Piet√† and on the crosspiece (croisillon) are statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter and John the Evangelist and Saint James the Greater. On the pedestal are what are thought to be remnants of other calvaries which are no longer in existence, namely a statue of Saint Catherine from the 15th Century and statues of Mary Magdalene and Saint Peter. Port-Launay The Saint-Aubin chapel in the village of Lanva√Ødic contains the commune of Port-Launay's calvary sculpted by Dor√© in 1631. The sculptures have been damaged and some have been placed in the chapel itself. The Dorƒó atelier are also credited with execution of the cross at Lanva√Ødic in 1651. Saint-Nic The Dorƒó atelier worked on both the church calvary and that of the Saint-C√¥me chapel in Saint-Nic. Rosno√´n Nearby the church in Rosno√´n is the memorial to those men of the commune who gave their lives in the 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 wars, and this has used the surviving statues from Dor√©'s 1648 calvary, namely statues back to back or g√©min√©e of John the Evangelist and Saint Bartholomew, the statue of the Virgin Mary and a bishop, a piet√†, and a statue of Saint Audoƒìn. Also for the √âglise Saint-Audoƒìn, the atelier executed a Dieu sauveur for the south porch and a Virgin Mary with child for the west porch.

On the Cross's crosspiece are statues of the Virgin Mary, Jesus on the cross and John the Evangelist. The statues of Saint S√©bastien and St Roch were not works by the Dorƒó atelier. There is also a piet√† by Dorƒó in the Ch√¢teaulin √âglise Saint-Idunet's north transept. Works by Dor√© in the Arrondissement of Quimper Dor√© is attributed with the following works in the Quimper arrondissement. Penmarch In Penmarch or Penmarc'h's √äglise Saint-Nonna is a sculpture of the Virgin Mary with child which is attributed to the Dorƒó atelier.

Cl√©den-Cap-Sizun In the enclos of the commune Cl√©den-Cap-Sizun there is a Dor√© calvary carrying the coats of arms of Ren√© de Keridiern and the mayor of Keryvon. In 1630, Dor√© created another calvary for the Saint-They chapel. This was mutilated but the statues of the Virgin Mary and St Jacques de Compostelle (Saint James the Greater) have been kept. Cl√©den-Cap-Sizun lies at the tip of Cap-Sizun, west of Quimper Sizun In the Sizun Mus√©e des Arts et traditions populaires, there is a Dor√© sculpture of the \\"bad robber\\" (\\"mauvais larron\\") thought to be what remains of a larger calvary. Esquibien The Dor√© calvary of Saint Edwette at Esquibien dates to 1633. To his depiction of Jesus on the cross, Dor√© added statues of the Virgin Mary and bishop Saint Onneau Tr√©zilid√© There is a Dor√© calvary in the Tr√©zilid√© parish church dating to 1630, although the John the Evangelist back to back with a bishop is by another sculptor.

Plou√©dern Fonts by Dor√© in the √âglise Saint-√âdern in Plou√©dern In 1974, the church at Plou√©dern, the √âglise Saint- Edern, was completely devastated by a fire but was restored for worship in 1978. Dor√©'s 1641 baptismal font (cuve de bapt√™me) survived the fire, but the font's canopy (baldaquin} did not. Plourin-l√®s-Morlaix The enclos paroissial of Plourin-l√®s-Morlaix comprises the usual church, cemetery, ossuary and retaining wall and in and around the church are several statues by Dor√© which had been part of a calvary.

What remains of the figure of Christ can be seen on the wall in the church's \\"Chapelle de la Vierge-des-douleurs\\". The parish church of Saint-Pierre The Poulgar Calvary. Roland Dor√©'s John the Evangelist can be seen to the right of the Cross This church in Plougar has a calvary in its graveyard sculpted by Yann Larhantec with statues of the Virgin Mary and St John on either side of the Cross bearing the crucified Jesus. Dor√©'s standing statue of John the Evangelist is positioned nearby. Poullan-sur-Mer Dor√©'s \\"Croix de chemin\\" at Poullan-sur-Mer is also known as the \\"Kervignac\\" cross and dates to 1640. It was restored in 1843. The statues from the cross are kept in a nearby farm. Works by Dor√© in the C√¥tes-d'Armor department The arrondissements of Lannion, Dinan, Saint Brieuc and Guingamp are the four Arrondissements of the C√¥tes-d'Armor. There are fewer calvaries in this department of Brittany, and as a consequence fewer works by Dor√©. This coastal area (ar mor means \\"the sea\\" in Breton and C√¥tes means \\"coasts\\" in French) is famous for the Pink Granite Coast (C√¥te de Granit Rose) and for Tr√©guier and its cathedral of St Tugdual. Lantic The Dor√© atelier worked on the calvary of Lantic's √âglise Notre-Dame de la Cour, sculpting the crucifix and the Virgin Mary with child and the coats of arms of the Rosmadec family. Ploumilliau Dor√© was the sculptor of the calvary at Coz-Douar in Ploumilliau. The work was carried out in 1622 and comprises Christ on the cross and the Virgin Mary with child. Ploubazlanec For the calvary at Loguivy-de-la-Mer in Ploubazlanec, Dor√© sculpted the figures of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. Lannion On the northeast pinnacle of the √âglise Saint-Jean-de-Baly in Lannion is a sculpture by Dor√© of the Virgin Mary. Plestin-les-Gr√®ves Dor√© is attributed with having completed statues of the twelve apostles and of Christ for the porch of the Saint-Efflam church in Plestin-les-Gr√®ves in 1619. On the church's fa√ßade there are back-to-back Dor√© sculptures of the Virgin Mary/Saint Yves and John the Evangelist back-to-back with an unidentified saint. These four sculptures are thought to have been part of a calvary. It was only in the porch of Plestin-les-Gr√®ves and that at Pleyber-Christ that Roland Dor√© sculpted all twelve statues of the apostles. Some of Dor√©'s sculptures of the twelve apostles in the porch of the Saint-Efflam church at Plestin-les-Gr√®ves Senven-L√©hart Senven-L√©hart is a commune in the Guingamp arrondissement of the C√¥tes-d'Armor department of Brittany. It is about south of Ploumagoar. Although most of Dor√©'s work is to be seen in Finist√®re, the calvary by the entrance to the √âglise Notre-Dame is one of the calvaries that he worked on in the C√¥tes-d'Armor region. It dates to 1635 and originally had 19 statues but the ravages of time and the Reign of Terror have seen these reduced to 12. The base of the calvary is granite whilst the statues were carved from kersantite. This calvary has three crosses, those of the two robbers Gesmas and Dismas on either side of that of Christ. The \\"bad\\" robber grimaces defiantly whilst the \\"good\\" robber looks to be at peace. Some have remarked that Dor√©'s Piet√† is one of the most beautiful in Brittany. Jesus is laid across Mary's lap whilst Marie-Salom√© supports his head and Mary Magdalene carries the oil to be used for the embalming. Also at the foot of the cross, Mary appears again and two horsemen are placed to her left and her right, one of whom was thought to represent Saint Longinus. John the Evangelist is also depicted with a full head of hair. On the reverse side of the calvary, Saint Peter is depicted carrying his key and a book, and below him is a depiction of Christ being taunted (Christ aux outrages) with Saint Yves to his left, dressed as a lawyer and Saint Louis carrying a symbol of justice.

Works in Morbihan Dor√© has been attributed with the following work in Morbihan. St Joseph Dor√©'s statue of St Joseph at Kerloaguen is reckoned to be the first modern statue of the Virgin Mary's husband. It was in 1640 that Fran√ßois le Cozic, the squire of Kerloaguen in Plougonven, decided to commission a statue of Joseph for the chapel he had placed under that saint's patronage and he chose Dor√© to execute the statue. In 1921, Pope Gr√©goire XV had ordered that 19 March be devoted as a feast day of the Virgin Mary's husband, and the Saint Joseph cult grew rapidly. In 1624, Quebec, in Canada, named St Joseph as their patron saint. When the chapel fell into ruin, the St Joseph statue was taken into the √âglise Saint-Joseph in Plougonven. Qu√©ven The Qu√©ven Calvary Dor√© was the sculptor of the calvary in Qu√©ven's old cemetery in the Rue du docteur Dieny just by the church. Originally there were a total of sixteen statues on the calvary, placed back to back as is the practice with Breton calvaries, but only five now survive, those of Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Saint Catherine and two bishops. The statue of Saint Paul stands alone. The Guimiliau Parish church The decoration of the porch of the Guimiliau parish church, the √âglise Saint-Miliau, was undertaken by the Maitre de Plougastel in 1606 and Dor√© added the bust of a woman and a statue of Christ enseignant to the Maitre de Plougastel's sculpture. Dor√©'s funereal sculpture Dor√© sculpted gisant for several tombs in Brittany. The tomb of Jacques Barbier This tomb is located in the Saint-Maudet chapel at Lesneven. It dates to 1638. The gisant of Yves Le Bervet du Parc Dor√© has been credited with creating the gisant, or effigy, for this tomb which is held by the Mus√©e D√©partemental Breton in Quimper. It had been in the cemetery of the Saint-Eutrope chapel in Plougonven. Dor√© also executed the gisant of Auffray de Chastel in the museum. The tomb of Guillaume de Rosmadec This tomb by Dor√© is in the √âglise Notre-Dame la Cour in Lantic. The tomb of Th√©bault de Tanouam This tomb by Dor√© is located in Pl√©rin's parish church. The Bois-Boissel tomb This tomb is one of several located in the cloister of Tr√©guier cathedral. The photograph below shows how the gisants are positioned in the cloister. Dor√© also executed two gisant for the Br√©hant family which are in the cathedral. Tombs in the cloister of the Cath√©drale Saint-Tugdual de Tr√©guier The tomb of Gilles de la No√© This tomb is located in Ploujean at the √âglise de Plounez. Gilles de la No√© was the sieur of Couenspeur. Br√©hant Dor√© worked on two tombs in Br√©hant. Non religious works In the grounds of the Trƒócesson ch√¢teau at Camp√©n√©ac are four statues by Roland Dorƒó. They came originally from the Crƒónan ch√¢teau and were purchased for Trƒócesson by the compte Henri de Pontbriand. The statues depict two seigneurs and their ladies: Pierre de Perrien and an unidentified woman, possibly his wife Madeleine du Bueil or his sister and Pierre's parents, Maurice de Perrien and his wife Anne Urvoy. The historic dioceses of Brittany Below is a map showing the historic dioceses of Brittany. The historic dioceses of Brittany Tr√©maou√©zan For the √âglise Notre-Dame in Tr√©maou√©zan the Dor√© atelier executed a statue of the Virgin Mary with child placed in a central niche on the church exterior and the apostles except for Saint Peter which can be seen in the church's south porch. The Virgin Mary with child at Tr√©maou√©zan's √âglise Notre-Dame See also *Saint Servais Parish close Notes Note 1. The enclos paroissial or parish close is an architectural grouping that is very common in Brittany. Not unlike the concept of the English close, except that the Breton grouping is limited to religious buildings and does not, as is the case in England, include administrative and other buildings. The enclos concept dates to the 16th and 17th century. It includes between five and eight elements all placed within a retaining wall: the church itself and an ossuary or a chapelle reliquaire; a calvary, mostly elaborate, with a depiction of the crucifixion at the top, sometimes with two crosses or gibbets bearing the robbers crucified with Jesus, figures of those who had been present at Jesus' death, and often complemented by statues of other saints and local dignitaries such as bishops; a porte triomphale often in the form of an arc de triomphe; and a cemetery which stood in an area known as the plac√Ætre. Sometimes the enclos would include a fountain. Note 2. The Ankou. Ankou‚Äôs iconography in sculpture, particularly on ossuaries, shows a skeletal figure, armed with a scythe or arrow and often accompanied by a slogan such as \\"Je vous tue tous\\" (I kill you all). In legend, Ankou's head could turn through 360 degrees, so that he never missed anything or anyone ‚Äì a fact that gives him a reputation of fairness, as everyone must die eventually. He travels at night in a creaking cart drawn by white horses, one fat, one thin, collecting the souls whose time has come and escorting them to another world.

The ship spent the bulk of her career deployed in the Far East. Between deployments she participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì12 during which she caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After that affair Marco Polo was sent to Libya where she bombarded the towns of Homs, and Zuara and the defenses of the Dardanelles. In between these operations, the ship provided naval gunfire support to the Royal Italian Army in Libya. Due to her age, Marco Polo did not play a significant role in World War I, serving as an accommodation ship in Venice until she began conversion into a troopship in 1917. After a series of renamings in 1920‚Äì21, the ship was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently sold for scrap. Design and description Right elevation and deck plan drawing from Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 Marco Polo was begun as an improved protected cruiser, but she was modified while under construction into an armored cruiser, the first such ship in Italian service. The ship had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of . She had a beam of and a draft of . Marco Polo displaced at normal load, and about at deep load. The ship had a complement of 22 officers and 372 enlisted men.Fraccaroli, p. 27 She was powered by two vertical triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was supplied by four Scotch marine boilers and their exhausts were trunked into a pair of funnels amidships. Rated at , her engines were designed to give Marco Polo a speed of , but the ship only reached a speed of during her sea trials even though the engines produced .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 350 She had a cruising radius of about at a speed of .Silverstone, p. 285 Marco Polos main armament consisted of six 40-caliber guns in single mounts. One of these guns was each mounted at the bow and stern and the remaining four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates. Ten 40-caliber guns served as the ship's secondary armament. They were all mounted on the broadside, four in unprotected embrasures in the hull sides and the other six on the upper deck protected by gun shields. For defense against torpedo boats, the ship carried nine quick-firing (QF) Hotchkiss guns and two QF Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with five torpedo tubes. The ship was protected by a armored belt that only protected the middle of her hull. The upper strake of armor was also 100 mm thick and protected just the middle of the ship, up to the height of the upper deck. The armored deck was thick. The armor of the conning tower and the gun shields were both thick. Construction and career Bimal elders and the Bimal Sultan on board Marco Polo discussing matters with Italian figures |alt= Marco Polo, named after the eponymous explorer,Silverstone, p. 301 was laid down on 1 July 1890 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. The ship was launched on 27 October 1892 and completed on 21 July 1894. She visited Candia (now Heraklion), Crete, and Piraeus, Greece, in May 1897 before departing for the Far East on 26 January 1898. In May 1898, Marco Polo sailed up China‚Ä≤s Yangtze River to make port visits at Nanking and Hankow before returning to Shanghai in July 1898. She visited Japan from August to November 1898 and then steamed to Shanghai, where she remained until August 1899. On 8 March 1899, while Marco Polo was at Shanghai, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Admiral Felice Napoleone Canevaro, ordered the protected cruiser Elba and her to occupy China‚Ä≤s Sanmen Bay (known as \\"San-Mun Bay\\" to the Italians) in a botched attempt to force China to grant Italy a lease there similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at Kiaochow Bay, but countermanded the order when he discovered that the United Kingdom would not support an Italian use of force.treccani.it Gabriele, Mariano, \\"CANEVARO, Felice Napoleone,\\" Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 18, 1975 (Italian)Smith, Shirley Ann, Imperial Designs: Italians in China, 1900‚Äì1947, Madison, New Jersey: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2012, , pp. 8‚Äì10 Marco Polo departed Shanghai on 27 August 1899 and arrived in Naples on 20 October 1899. She departed for China in October 1901 and remained there until February 1903. A year later, she began her third tour there in March 1904 and did not leave China until 14 January 1907. En route home the ship visited Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland, and Massawa, Eritrea before arriving at Taranto on 26 April.Marchese Marco Polo was rearmed in 1911 and her armament was reduced to six 152 mm, four 120 mm, six 57 mm, and two 37 mm guns. One torpedo tube was also removed during this refit. When the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì12 began on 29 September 1911, Marco Polo was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was quickly transferred, however, to the command of Rear-Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, Inspector of Torpedo Boats.Beehler, p. 9 His command was deployed in the Adriatic Sea and was patrolling the area for Ottoman ships. Marco Polo and two destroyers stopped an Austro-Hungarian ship on 5 October in the bay at San Giovanni di Medua, Albania, and when they sent a boat to board the merchant ship, Ottoman coastal artillery began firing at the boat. The Italian ships returned fire for 45 minutes and silenced the guns after nearly exhausting their ammunition. The incident prompted a diplomatic protest by Austria- Hungary and Italy ceased its operations against the Ottomans in Albania. Marco Polo was then transferred to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron, operating off the Libyan coast.Stephenson, pp. 98‚Äì101, 109 On 17 October, she arrived at Homs to support Italian forces attempting to occupy the town and bombarded it after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender. Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops. Marco Polo was tasked to provide fire support for the Royal Italian Army and remained at Homs after the bulk of the fleet returned to Italy to refit in December. In early April 1912, the ship, together with the armored cruiser bombarded Zuara as a distraction while the army made an unopposed landing away.Beehler, pp. 30‚Äì31, 37, 47, 50, 53, 65 About a week later, she rejoined the 4th Division as it, and the bulk of the Italian fleet, sailed east in a futile search for the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea. Marco Polo joined the rest of the fleet in desultorily bombarding the defenses of the entrance to the Dardanelles on 18 April.Stephenson, pp. 262‚Äì65 The ship then returned to Libya where she resumed her previous task of providing fire support for the army. In June she supported the operation to capture MisrataBeehler, p. 81 and finally returned home on 16 July. Marco Polo departed Taranto on 25 February 1913 for her fourth deployment to the Far East. When World War I began in August 1914, she was in Kobe, Japan and the Italian declaration of neutrality on 2 August simplified the problems faced by the Allies in the Far East.Halpern, p. 73 The ship departed Shanghai on 7 December and was diverted to Hodeidah, Yemen, en route and finally reached Naples on 4 March 1915. Thoroughly obsolete by the time Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915, Marco Polo was used as an accommodation ship at Venice; among those personnel housed aboard were the crews of the British submarines operating there from October 1915 through May 1917.Kemp & Jung, pp. 14, 18, 23 The ship began conversion into a troop transport at the Venetian Arsenal in 1917. This required the removal of her armor, the replacement of her armament with some guns and internal modifications to suit her new role. She was recommissioned with the new name of Cortellazo on 4 April 1918. The ship was rechristened Europa on 1 October 1920, discarded on 16 January 1921, but simultaneously rechristened Volta, then discarded on 5 January 1922. She was sold for scrap.

Only some remains of the first city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht, and a replica of a burg (castle) named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais during the 19th century. Parts of the canals that protected the city between the 12th and 16th century have been covered and used as a sewage system. Both the 16th century city walls and the 19th century fortifications have been covered up by major infrastructure works during the 19th and 20th century.  Overview  Antwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in six phases: * First fortification 980 AD: first fortified wall and ditch, improved around 1100 * Second fortification 12th century: first vlieten and ruien (city canals) were dug ** Expanded second fortification during 13th and 14th century: *** expansion to the north with more ruien *** expansion to the south with vesten * Third fortification before the 16th century: on the south and east side of the city * Fourth fortification, 16th century: construction of the Spanish fortifications * Fifth fortification, early 19th century: construction of a 1st ring of Brialmont fortresses about 10 km from the original burg * Sixth fortification, 19th century after the independence of Belgium: construction of a 2nd ring of Brialmont fortresses about 20 km from the original burg From the 18th century major works and construction projects have changed the nature of the original innercity canals, and in the 19th and 20th century the projects for the development of the port have destroyed all visible signs of the fortification works and made the canals disappear from view. Some of the fortifications are still being used as military installations.  First fortification ca. 10th century AD  Antwerp, 19th century drawing of the 10th century fortifications Antwerp, 1st fortification from 11th century. Sketch on a 19th-century streetmap, with overlay of 19th century construction of Scheldt quais. Since the Treaty of Verdun (843) the river Scheldt was the natural and political border between the County of Flanders (belonging to the Kingdom of France) to the west and the German Empire. In 980 the German Emperor Otto II awarded Antwerp a margraviate, and ordered a fortification built on the wharf, part of his fortification program for his western border. Around 1106 the Counts of Leuven, the later Dukes of Brabant, acquired the Margraviate of Antwerp, and it continued to be part of the Duchy of Brabant until the end of the Ancien R√©gime.Geschiedenis van Antwerpen, Provincial Council of Antwerp, History (in Dutch)Blog , by writer and historian Jan Lampo The first fortification consisted of a wall and ditch surrounding an enceinte built partly on the wharf. The wall was about high and thick and the ditch (on the north and southside of the fortification wall) was about - wide. The ditch wa located at the north and eastside at the current location of the street called Burchtgracht (a name that translates literally into \\"fortress ditch\\"), in the south it was at the Palingbrug. In 1104 Emperor Hendrik IV reinforced the walls to high and thick. The remnants of this wall can still be seen near the west face of the Vleeshuis at the end of the Vleeehuisstraat\\" . The wharf was a dry landmass, a dry hill protruding about 30 m into the main track of the river Scheldt (measured from the current 19th-century Scheldt-quayside). The enceinte within the wall was about in size, and contained 3 streets: the old Steenstraat (the current ramp leading to the het Steen building), the Zakstraat and the Mattestraat, and there was a square : the Burgplein. The rivershore sloped steeply into the river at the south and west of the wharf and more gently at the northside (the quays in the drawings to the right were constructed at a later date). On the westside there was only a fortification wall (no ditch) facing the river with a tollhouse at the wharfgate. Within the enceinte the most important buildings were: * house het Steen, (part of the current monument), * house het hof van Cruyninghe (the Margrave's residence), * the church dedicated to St Walburga, (which has entirely disappeared) * the Vierschaer (the tribunal) * a refuge of the Affligem Abbey * a brewery. During recent excavations behind the Vleeshuis on the intersection of the current Vleeshuisstraat and Burchtgracht, the remainder of the medieval wall structure was excavated and also the floor of the cellar of house De Gans (The Goose, an inn) and a well. Another part of the fortification wall that had been enclosed in the old \\"badhuis\\" building (formerly the public baths) was made visible again when that building was demolished (a new structure has been built on the badhuis site, but the remainder of the medieval fortification wall is now better preserved, see gallery).  Before the 13th century  The city developed quickly outside its initial fortification, and by 1200 it had quadrupled in surface. Because trade had become the main activity of the city, canals were dug around its extremities, to allow barges to bring cargo into the city to and from the ships moored at the wharf. Those canals were called ruien . The canals flooded at high tide and emptied at low tide. The canals that connected with the main river Scheldt were called vliet Initially the barges moored in the early canals would come to rest on the muddy bottom making cargo handling nearly impossible. So at certain places attempts were made to build wooden jetties and stone fortified quays to replace the sloping embankments of the canals such that barges could be moored alongside and be discharged and loaded even if the canal was empty of river water. The canals were considered the second fortification of Antwerp. The triangle of canals (ruiendriehoek) enclosed about . All of the ruien and vlieten of the ruiendriehoek heve been covered and served as the city sewage system, the system is open for visits by tourists.Antwerp underground The current street names still remind of the \\"rui\\", \\"vliet\\" below it and the \\"brug\\" (bridge) reminded of bridges allowing access to the city.

During the 13th century However, buildings would soon be constructed on the outside of the ruien, and as trade increased two expansions occurred during the 13th century. Before 1250 an extension of the ruien was dug to the south. The canals were named vliet (connected to the Scheldt and vest.vest from veste, vesting, old Dutch for fortified place, fortification ditch from P.A.F. van Veen en N. van der Sƒ≥s (1997), Van Dale Etymologisch woordenboek; J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek; N. van Wijk (1936 [1912]), Franck's Etymologisch woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal * the St Cathelijnevest, connected at the Wijngardbridge to the Jezuitenrui and the Minderbroedersrui, * another vest (name lost, but suspected Huidevettersvest) at the current trace of the Wiegstraat * and then right back to the Scheldt Lombardenvest * St Jansvliet. To the north the Dominican order decided to build a monastery, the \\"Predikherenklooster\\". The Holenrui was filled up again, which meant there was no waterpassage between the end of the Kool- or Kolenvliet (a current street, name Koolkaai) and the Minderbroedersui and Koepoortbridge. In order to create a passage to the Minderbroedersrui 3 new canals were dug around the monastery, the Verversrui, Falconrui and one of which the name has disappeared from the maps. North of the Koolrui a new access canal was dug between the Scheldt and the Verversrui: the St Pietersvliet. At the end of the 13th century (1295) John II, Duke of Brabant decided to create new fortifications, which made the city grow to . He started in the south incorporating the St Michielsadbij that had been built south of the St Jansvliet) inside the fortifications, and built the Kronenburg-tower on the river bank. The fortification went in a nearly straight line east to the Bluetower (currently Blauwtorenplein) where the fortification went north through the Wapper (where Rubens had his residence and atelier) and Cauwenberg right up to the Paardenmarkt (horse market) where it joined the north fortification of the Falconrui. 16th century The 16th century \\"Spanish fortifications\\" and the old citadel defended by General Chass√© in 1832, have totally vanished. Modern Antwerp's broad city-center boulevard (Italielei, Frankrijklei, Britselei and Amerikaleimap will follow) marks the position of the original (second) Spanish fortifications. 19th century At the time of the establishment of Belgian independence, Antwerp was defended by the citadel and an enceinte around the city. In 1859, seventeen of the twenty-two fortresses constructed under Wellington's supervision in 1815‚Äì1818 were dismantled and the old citadel and enceinte were removed. A new enceinte long was constructed, and the villages of Berchem and Borgerhout, now boroughs of Antwerp, were absorbed within the city. This enceinte is protected by a broad wet ditch, and in the caponiers are the magazines and store chambers of the fortress. The enceinte has nineteen openings or gateways, but of these seven are not used by the public. As soon as the enceinte was finished, eight detached forts from from the enceinte were constructed. They begin in the north near Wijnegem and the zone of inundation, and terminate in the south at Hoboken. In 1870 Fort Merksem and the redoubts of Berendrecht and Oorderen were built for the defence of the area to be inundated north of Antwerp. In the 1870s, the fortifications of Antwerp were deemed to be out of date, given the increased range and power of artillery and explosives. Antwerp was transformed into a fortified position by constructing an outer line of forts and batteries 6 to from the enceinte.

A 3.5-litre boxer-12, it was used by the Coloni team for the first eight races, but proved to be very unsuccessful and the team reverted to using the old Cosworth DFR V8 engine. Alba also used it in the World Sportscar Championship in 1990, but were similarly unsuccessful and switched to a 4.5-litre Buick V6 midway through the season. History After seeing fellow Japanese manufacturers Yamaha and Honda enter Formula One as engine suppliers, Subaru decided to follow suit in 1989. They contracted the Italian firm Motori Moderni to build the engine for them; Motori Moderni had previously built a turbocharged V6 engine during the turbo era in the mid 1980s. This engine had been primarily used by the Minardi team from 1985 to 1987, although AGS briefly used it in 1986, but never saw any real success. For Subaru, Motori Moderni came up with a 3.5-litre, 60-valve flat-twelve engine in the boxer configuration that the Japanese firm's road cars utilised. Although the flat-twelve design had proven successful for Ferrari in the mid-to-late-1970s in their multiple championship-winning 312T series of cars, it had fallen out of favour from 1980 onwards due to the advent of the ground effects cars, which the wide flat engine configuration did not suit. Despite this, Motori Moderni's owner Carlo Chiti felt that the flat engine configuration would provide some aerodynamic benefits due to its inherent low centre of gravity. The engine, which was named the Subaru 1235, first appeared in a Minardi test car at the Misano track in May 1989, and dyno tests indicated that it had a maximum power output of . This was significantly less than its rivals; even the Cosworth DFR V8 engine produced at least , whilst the dominant engine of the 1989 season, which was Honda's RA109E V10, produced at least . Although Chiti was targeting a final power output of , which would've made the new engine competitive with the DFR, the Subaru 1235 had another Achilles heel; its weight. Although the basic engine itself weighed , which was only or so heavier than the Cosworth DFR, the weight of its ancillaries meant that it was actually heavier than a complete DFR unit. The engine primarily used Magneti Marelli electronics, and a Minardi-developed gearbox. Although Subaru intended to provide the Minardi team with the engine, they instead opted to partner Minardi's Italian rivals, Coloni, for the 1990 season, even purchasing half of the team. The Coloni C3, which had been used the previous season, was extensively modified into the \\"C3B\\" specification to be suitable for use with the Subaru 1235, and Bertrand Gachot was hired to drive it. The engine made its d√©but at the 1990 United States Grand Prix, but it was not a happy one; Gachot finished dead-last in pre-qualifying, having been unable to even complete a single lap before a gear-linkage failure. Things would not improve for the Coloni team, as the Subaru engine proved to be fragile as well as underpowered, and its bulk also meant that the C3B's handling was unpredictable. Following a falling-out between Coloni, his team and Subaru, the Japanese firm opted to end their involvement after the 1990 British Grand Prix, just eight races after the engine had made its d√©but, and without the C3B pre-qualifying once. The Coloni team promptly reverted to the Cosworth DFR in their updated C3C model, but, although they were often able to pre-qualify with this package, they never qualified for a race again and folded at the end of the 1991 season. The Subaru 1235 engines, however, were not only used in Formula One. They were also used in the World Sportscar Championship by Alba, in their Group C AR20 car, during the 1990 season. Just like in Formula One, the engine proved to be extremely unsuccessful, and the AR20 Subaru only qualified for one race. On its d√©but at the 1990 480 km of Suzuka, for example, the AR20, driven by Gianfranco Brancatelli and Marco Brand was nearly eight seconds slower in qualifying than any other car, and nearly half a minute slower than the fastest qualifier. The one race it did qualify for, the 1990 480 km of Spa, saw the AR20 unable to make the start due to engine failure. This would also prove to be the AR20's last race with the Subaru engine, as Alba switched to a 4.5-litre Buick V6 for the 1990 480 km of N√ºrburgring; this was marginally more successful, and would eventually yield a 16th-place finish in the final race of the season, which was the 1990 480 km of Mexico City.

She was the first woman in Spain to be licensed in medicine and the second woman in the country to earn a Doctor of Medicine degree.  Early life and education  An only child, Aleu learned to read by age 5. She studied at the University of Barcelona, though during 1874-1875 she attended classes at the University of Valencia. She earned her undergraduate degree in July, 1874. The following September, she enrolled in the university's medical school. Aleu completed her studies in 1879, but she didn't receive permission to take the licensing exam until nearly three years later, in the spring of 1882. She finally took the exam on June 19 of that year. She passed with excellent marks and thus became the first Spanish woman licensed to practice medicine.La Vanguardia, 17 March 2010, pages 24-25 Doctores en Medicina, letter to the editor from M. Conxa Montagud On October 8, 1882, Aleu became just the second Spanish woman to earn a doctorate in medicine (she received her MD four days after Martina Castells Ballesp√≠). Her thesis, presented on October 6, was titled On the need to set the hygienic and moral education of women on a new course. In it, she criticized discrimination against women.  Career  Aleu specialized in gynecology and pediatrics. One of the first three women to study medicine in Spain (in addition to Castells and Maria Elena Maseras), Aleu alone went on to practice medicine. She opened a medical consulting firm in Barcelona, which she ran for 25 years. Castells, meanwhile, died before she could practice, and Elena Maseras dedicated her career to teaching.La Vanguardia, 23 March 2010, page 20 Doctores en Medicina, letter to the editor from M. Dolors Cuyas R., Aleu's great-granddaughter Aleu was highly active during her 25 years in practice. She was a professor of domestic hygiene at the Academy of Sciences, Arts and Offices for Women, which was founded in 1885 at 10 Rambla de Canaletes by the liberal-minded musician Clotilde Cerd√† i Bosch (better known by her stage name, Esmeralda Cervantes). Aleu was also the author of informative texts aimed at improving the quality of life for women, especially mothers. These included Advice to a Mother on Management, Cleaning, Clothing, Sleep, Exercise, and Entertaining the Children. Personal life In 1883, Aleu married Camilo Cuy√†s Mart√≠. They had two sons, Joan and Camil. Joan, the elder, studied industrial engineering while Camil studied medicine. Camil died tragically at age 23 from tuberculosis. It is believed his death precipitated Aleu's own death at age 56.

The church is a part of the √ñrgryte congregation () in Gothenburg. Because of the nature of the plot, the church is oriented northeast‚Äìsouthwest. It has a cross layout with open rafters and vaulted, pentagonal chancels. The church tower is almost 60 meters tall.  History  From 1870, the churchgoers of √ñrgryte contemplated a major project as their existing 400-seat church could not contain the growing congregation. In 1885, under the leadership of the Reverend Magnus Ekberg, construction of a new church was proposed. A collection was taken and the church agreed to take a loan of SEK 50,000 to meet the estimated cost. Among the generous contributors were merchant David Lundstrom of Under√•s farm, James Dickson, David Carnegie and Oscar Ekman. The new church was to be more than twice the size of the existing church, seating over 1,000 people. The new building followed the trend of its contemporary churches and was made from brick. The building required firm ground, so it was built on top of the Svalberget. Some of the major purchases were made as individual donations. The local brewer, JW Lyckholm of Sk√•r, paid for two bells. Captain Pontus Virgin of K√•lltorp paid for the altar while the stained glass windows were donated by the wholesaler Peter Hammarberg. The architect was Adrian C. Peterson, and the builder was F O Peterson. Work began in the summer of 1888, and the church was consecrated on July 6, 1890 by bishop Edvard Rodhe. The final cost was 226,000 SEK. Donations covered slightly more than 120,000 and the remaining sum was procured through a loan of SEK 50,000 and from the church fund. The church is built in red B√∂rringe Brick from Sk√•ne, and did not receive electricity until 1908. √ñrgryte New Church, Bengt Aberg, √ñrgryte Township, GDIF, Gothenburg 1990 √ñrgryte in bygone days, Soren Cut Back, Three Books Publisher, Gothenburg 1993 The facades have rich tegelornering, stone moldings and forgings. A thorough restoration took place in 1937 under A. Forss√©ns line, and the pulpit was moved. In 1952, four painted circular windows of the chancel were transferred to the stands, while other painted korf√∂nster (stained glass) from 1889, magazines were. Church organs The church has two organs: * Willis organ, originally built 1871 for St. Stephen's Church in Hampstead, London by Henry Willis, who was the leading organ-builder in England from 1850. When the church in Hampstead was closed in 1971, the organ was disassembled and sold to the Netherlands. In 1992, the Academy of Music in Gothenburg learned of the instrument, after which it was purchased by Tostareds Organ Factory and in 1998 by the √ñrgryte Assembly Organ Foundation. The organ is the largest Victorian organ of British manufacture in Sweden. * The North German Baroque organ, built as part of extensive research at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers. It was constructed at the GOArt (G√∂teborg Organ Art Center) workshop under the leadership of Mats Arvidsson, Henk van Eeken and Munetaka Yokota. The instrument has four manuals and pedal, with 54 stops distributed. The goal had been to recreate a North German baroque organ, the Arp Schnitger (1648‚Äì1719).  The church bells  The church tower has two bells, each with the inscription: The Oscar II government when D r E. H. Rodhe was a bishop in the Diocese of Gothenburg and Dean J. M. Ekberg vicar of √ñrgryte : Became the bell cast at Eriksbergs Mech. Werkstad in 1899 the factory owner J. W. Lyckholms expense. The larger bell has the inscription: Come, for all things are now ready.

In 1950, the church painter Thor Fagerkvist (1884‚Äì1960) was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the church. It would replace Carl Johan Dyfverman's crucifixion group from 1890. It was a triptych consisting of five oil paintings on canvas, three of which are usually visible with pictures related to Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, while the cabinet is closed during Lent, and then shows the other two paintings, photographed wagon and no Gethsemane. The frame was designed by architect Axel Forss√©n. ; The old altar The great altar of cut oak wood was placed on the altar in the church in 1890, and was the work of Dyfverman. The subject is the crucified Jesus with Mary, the other Mary and the disciple John, beneath the cross. The sculpture was painted in 1923, and in 1969 was restored by artwork conservator Torsten √ñhl√©n. Crucifixion group was moved in 1951 to its current location in the transept.  Altar  On the altar stood a 1952 crucifix of ivory and ebony by Gothenburg sculptor Henry Johansson, as well as the altar a gift of parishioners.

Life Early years Aurora Lacasa was born in Paris. Her parents were both journalists, and at the time of Aurora's birth the family were among the thousands of politically active Spanish intellectuals who had fled to France from Spain to escape from the violent predations of the Francoist regime, now in power following their victory in the Spanish Civil War. However, in 1948 the Lacasa family relocated again, this time from France to Hungary. The family settled in Budapest where Aurora attended school between 1951 and 1956. Although the 1956 Hungarian uprising is remembered as a nationwide revolt, the fighting and the associated dangers were particularly intense in and around Budapest. In Budapest Ernesto Lacasa had become involved with the World Federation of Democratic Youth: as the Soviet tanks appeared on the Hungarian city streets Ernesto Lacasa, fearing for their safety, moved his family again, this time to the recently created German Democratic Republic. They ended up, initially, in Ziegenhals, just outside Berlin, moving later to the Pankow district of Berlin. Aurora, now aged 9, resumed her schooling, successfully completing her final school exams after her transition into the German education system. \\"I was a simultaneous translator, and I bought W-50 trucks for Cuba.\\" \\"Ich war Dolmetscherin und kaufte f√ºr Kuba W50-Lastwagen.\\" ::::::::Aurora Lacasa as quoted in 2010 Aurora remained in Berlin and undertook an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering with the VEB Bergmann-Borsig turbine and generator manufacturer. This gave her insights into heavy engineering which would find an unexpected use when she later undertook translation work. By the end of the 1960s she was working as a simultaneous translator between German, French and Spanish, also working for the Cuban embassy in Berlin. Cuba had been under a trade embargo from western industrial countries since 1960, which provided rich commercial pickings for industrial countries, such as East Germany, not allied with the United States. Lacasa's translation job with the embassy placed her at the heart of important negotiations for the supply of modern machinery and vehicles, including trucks, to Cuba. The Big Break In 1968 Aurora's mother, Pilar Lacasa was involved in preparations for the World Festival of Youth and Students, held that year in Sofia. On the train from Berlin she fell into conversation with members of Oktoberklub, a left-leaning politically engaged East German music group then at the height of their success. Pinar Lacasa mentioned that she had two children who could sing\\"Ich habe auch zwei Kinder, die singen k√∂nnen.\\" This turned out to be the beginning of Aurora Lacasa's first contact with the mainstream popular music scene in East Germany, and at the end of the same year Aurora was able to participate as a singer at an International Youth Camp held at Prenden (Wandlitz), just outside Berlin. Her performances of songs from the Spanish Civil War and her musical settings from Lorca's poems impressed her young audience. The circumstances of Lorca's death in 1936 also made him a hero for the East German arts and culture establishment. Aurora Lacasa, who still counts Lorca among her favourite writers, found herself \\"talent spotted\\". With support from the GDR Broadcasting Corporation's youth radio programme, DT64, Lacasa was offered and accepted a training place as a singer at the National Studio for Entertainment Arts. Discography Aurora Lacasa has issued three LPs, many music singles and, since 1990, at least three CDs. Taken together there have been something like three million discs sold. Among the most successful have been: { * Weihnachten in Familie (1985 ‚Äì LP) * Geh so wie du kamst * Immer wieder diese Liebe * Peterchens Mondfahrt, 1 und 2 (LPs) * Nimm den Zug, der Sehnsucht hei√üt * Adieu Papa * Maria * Susani * Bring ihn mir wieder, Wind * Still, still, still * Kommt herein und setzt euch nieder * In Bethlehem * Das kann nur Liebe sein * Alles Gute im Leben * Er war mein Freund * Hier wo das Meer zu Ende ist * Guten Abend hier bin ich * Wenn die Wanderv√∂gel ziehn (2000) * Lebenslinien (2005) * Weihnachten in Frieden (2009) } Training and success as a singer While training, Aurora Lacasa got to know fellow artists such as Wolfgang Ziegler and Barbara Thalheim. Lacasa's own repertoire soon connected with audiences, and she regularly appeared on the long-running television variety show, \\"Ein Kessel Buntes\\". She also appeared in galas at Berlins's Friedrichstadt-Palast (review theatre), in other television shows such as \\"Weihnachten in Familie\\" (1985) and \\"Lutz und Liebe\\", and in live events across the country. Hit songs included titles such as \\"Das kann doch nur Liebe sein\\" (\\"It really can only be love\\") (with Thomas L√ºck) and \\"Wenn die Wanderv√∂gel ziehn\\" (\\"If the migrating bird calls\\"). The recording of \\"Weihnachten in Familie\\", created by Lacasa and her second husband, Frank Sch√∂bel, and released as an LP in 1985, became East Germany's top selling disc. Singing tours abroad followed, taking in the Soviet Union, Cuba, Bulgaria, France, Portugal and the Middle East. Although her international singing career originally blossomed in the German Democratic Republic, she enjoyed continuing success after reunification. Her more recent television appearances have nevertheless increasingly been restricted to \\"Christmas Spectaculars\\" for which, in recent years, she has been accompanied by a band of younger South American Musicians. In 2009 she was on the road again with her \\"Spurensuche\\" (\\"Looking for the way\\") solo programme, now incorporating some lighter songs, and not concentrated just on the exuberant Schlager music with which she first built her television career. However, the attention of music fans has begun to focus increasingly on the singing career of her daughter, Dominique Lacasa. Personal Aurora Lacasa has a brother, Ernesto, with whom she has also performed as a singer. Aurora Lacasa's first marriage, in the mid-1970s was to the singer Thomas L√ºck. Towards the end of the twentieth century she married, secondly, her partner, the singer Frank Sch√∂bel. More recently she has had a house built with her manager-partner J√ºrgen Krajewski, to whom some sources indicate she is now married. After breaking with Frank Sch√∂bel Lacasa lived for some time in an apartment in down-town Berlin. She then, during the early years of the twenty-first century, spent some years living in Spain to care for her parents, before returning to live in Prenden, in the countryside outside Berlin.

The stela was discovered in the mid nineteenth century at the ancient site of Kalhu (now known as Nimrud) by the British archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam. Dated to between 824-811 BC, the sculpture is now part of the British Museum's collection of Middle East antiquties.British Museum Highlights British Museum Collection Discovery This stela was found by Rassam in 1855 near the Temple of Nabu at Nimrud. It was shipped to London the following year to become part of the British Museum's Assyrian collection, where it is displayed alongside the Kurkh Monoliths and adjacent to the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III and the White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I. Description The stela portrays the Assyrian King worshipping five gods in a format very similar to the Stela of Ashurnasirpal II. The monarch is shown wearing a conical hat and full beard in archaic style, with his right hand extended snapping his fingers, and his left hand holding a mace, symbol of royal authority. The five deities are represented symbolically in the top left hand corner of the stela: Ashur by a horned helmet, Shamash by a winged disk, Sin by a crescent, Adad by a forked line and Ishtar in the form of a star. A large amount of cuneiform text written in an earlier, obsolete style covers the sides of the stela, recording the king's military campaigns.

It is on the crossing of Hretska Street and Oleksandrivskyi Prospekt. At different times it has been called Aleksandrovskaya () or Martynovskogo (). This is one of the biggest squares of Odessa. It is rectangular, with the oval building of Mayurov House in the center, also with semi-round houses on the sides. This is the oldest square in Odessa. It survived from the market square of the town of Khadzhibey. Down by Hretska Street, between Hretska Ploshcha and Katerynynska Street, was a Muslim cemetery. After the capture of the Khadzhibey Fortress the square was free of buildings. The building construction started from the part close to Hretska Street, later from Deribasivska Street. The buildings were built mainly by Greeks in Ukraine of the families Ioannopulos, Serafinos, Papakhadzhis, Rallis, and Maraslis. The Greek secret society Filiki Eteria ( is the Society of Friends) (whose aim was the struggle for independence of Greece) was in one of the buildings on the square since 1814. House of Filiki Eteria The main market of the city was in the square for a long time. The garden square was in the centre of the square until the Greek Orthodox church was built. But the church building was not finished, and its foundations were re-used for building Mayurov House, also known as the Roundhouse. The last construction was a mall. In the Soviet period the square was an important transport centre. Here was the tram station (later the trolleybus station), also the bus terminal. The semi-round house which separated the square from the Bunina Street, was demolished during World War II. The place was used as a garden in the 1950s and 1960s, but later the modern restaurant building was constructed. Mayurov House was demolished in 1996 and then rebuilt with significant changes.

His attention to detail of the installation of his work led him occasionally to create rooms or constructions for their display. Life McKeown was born to a Presbyterian family in County Tyrone. He was brought up on a farm which remained an inspiration throughout his artistic life.http://www.imma.ie/en/page_170647.htm In 1980-81, he studied Art History at the University College, London. In 1984, he graduated in Textile Design at Central School of Art & Design, London. He worked at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, demonstrating weaving techniques. In 1987, he graduated with an MA in Design from Glasgow School of Art. McKeown moved to Dublin in Ireland in 1988; he worked at the Kerlin Gallery until 1991. In 1994, he graduated with a Masters in Fine Art at the University of Ulster in Belfast. The Kerlin Gallery presented his first solo show in 1996. McKeown was board member of Temple Bar Gallery and Studios (2002-2005, at the time he had a studio there) and the Douglas Hyde Gallery (2002-2005). From September 2004, he was in residence in the Old Convent in Lismore for one year. In 2006, he moved to Edinburgh. He died in Edinburgh at the age of 49. Work His abstract paintings (initially on canvas, then on linen) went from monochrome to subtle gradations of tone, which became more gestural, pulsating or woven. McKeown's work has connections with certain aspects of minimalist, post-minimalist, post-painterly and conceptual art.http://www.avfestival.co.uk/programme/2010/events-exhibitions/felix- gonzalez-torres-and-william-mckeown-a-certain-distance-endless-light He particularly admired the work of Agnes Martin, for instance. He also made small realistic coloured pencil drawings of the wild flowers typical of his home county (primrose, snowdrop, buttercup), always against stark blank paper. His sensitivity for light, colour, textiles transferred into his highly considered constructions or rooms (such as Nest (The Bravery of Birds) for the Venice Biennale in 2005). In situ installations were set up with great precision. A sense of place was often conveyed as titles referenced birds (The Corncrake, Starlings), wildlife, the countryside of his childhood (The Meadow, The Lane, The Hayfield), cities (Hope Painting ‚Äì Abercromby Place, 2006, Arts Council of Ireland collection), the weather (Cloud Painting, Raining).

Miller scaled a large sequoia tree near a major downtown intersection and remained there for over 24 hours, rebuffing rescue and negotiation attempts and tossing debris at onlookers. The situation disrupted Seattle traffic patterns, became a trending topic across social media, and attracted national attention from news outlets. Miller's treatment by law enforcement and coverage by the media has spurred further debate on the adequacy of mental health care in the USA. Details Miller climbed an sequoia in a Stewart Street traffic island outside the historic former Bon March√© flagship store in downtown Seattle, early on March 22, 2016. He remained there for nearly 25 hours while police forces attempted to coax him down. Miller responded to dialog attempts by throwing sequoia cones, branches he had torn from the crown, and fruit remains, some of which hit passersby. The falling debris and the intervention efforts gridlocked roadways in downtown Seattle‚Äôs center, forcing multiple buses to find alternate routes. The event garnered significant media attention, prompting viral Twitter parodies, live streams of negotiation efforts, and national news coverage. After over 24 hours, Miller descended the tree of his own accord at around 11:45 AM on March 23, where he was given food and taken into an ambulance. Miller was subsequently charged with third-degree assault and first-degree malicious mischief but was found incompetent to stand trial after a psychiatric competency evaluation. Impact Onlookers on 4th Avenue watching the \\"Man in Tree\\" Man in Tree generated nationwide interest, with news stations feeding live streams of the event and Twitter users elevating the hashtag \\"#ManInTree\\" to trending status. The event also rekindled discussion of the country‚Äôs mental health system. After the incident, Miller‚Äôs mother said that he was \\"obviously sick\\" and that psychiatric care would be more appropriate than jail time. Online periodicals helped spread this perspective in hopes of reorienting the conversation around systemic reform. Miller himself denounced Seattle law enforcement for his alleged mistreatment in the aftermath. Additionally, Congressman Tim Murphy (R, PA) cited Man in Tree when calling for Congressional action on his proposed Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (H.R. 2646). Tree experts evaluated the sequoia afterward and found that the ordeal inflicted roughly $7,800 worth of damage to the tree.  In popular culture  The song \\"Pinecones\\" by the Seattle-based band Bug Hunter was inspired by Man in Tree.

It stars Frank Grillo, Bojana Novakovic, Iko Uwais, Callan Mulvey, Yayan Ruhian, Pamelyn Chee, Betty Gabriel, and Antonio Fargas. It is a direct sequel to the 2010 film Skyline, picking up where the first film left off. The film was released on December 15, 2017 in the United States by Vertical Entertainment. Unlike its critically panned predecessor, Beyond Skyline received mixed reviews, with several critics calling it an improvement over the original. A third and final film, originally titled Skylines and then Skylin3s, again directed by O'Donnell and produced by the Strause brothers, is set for release in 2020. Plot Taking place at the same time of Skyline, Mark Corley, a Los Angeles police detective, helps his estranged son, Trent, out of jail just as an alien invasion begins. The entire population of the city is sucked into various spaceships by a blue light. Mark leads a group of surviving humans through underground subway tunnels to escape, though most of the humans are killed or abducted, one by one. The survivors ‚Äì Mark, Trent, transit operator Audrey, and a homeless man known only as \\"Sarge\\", who is immune to the blue light due to his blindness ‚Äì escape to the marina following the city's nuclear destruction, only to be abducted into the alien flagship by a towering alien tanker. On board the spaceship, Mark tries to find his son and storms his way into various chambers, where he meets up with survivor Elaine and her transformed boyfriend Jarrod (from the first film). Elaine explains that Jarrod retained control of his mind despite being transformed into a bio-mechanical alien soldier. Though Elaine is three months pregnant, her pregnancy has accelerated and she gives birth to a daughter. Elaine dies during the delivery, and Mark and Jarrod team up to destroy the alien ship by setting alien explosives inside the ship's control systems. When Jarrod is killed when he fights the alien leader, Mark rescues Audrey but is too late to save his son. Trent has his brain taken and placed in another alien bio- mechanical machine creature. Sarge is badly wounded when he defends the baby from an alien. The dying Jarrod destroys the ship, which crashes in rural Laos. Mark, Audrey, Sarge and the baby escape from the spaceship which starts to repair itself. Sarge dies from his wounds shortly after the group meets Sua and his sister Kanya who belong to a drug cartel and fight against both aliens and local rogue ex-policemen bandits. As they trek through the jungle, the group discovers that the human baby grows at an accelerated rate into a three- year-old in just one day. Sua and Kanya lead Mark, Audrey, and the baby to a hidden human resistance hideout and drug processing facility located in local ruins. There, Harper, a medical officer and former drug chemist, examines the baby girl and learns about her unique DNA. Harper believes her blood may be the key to defeating the aliens due to her evolving DNA. Using the child's blood and recovered alien technology, Harper develops a serum he believes will free the bio-mechanical soldiers from alien control and restore their human personality. Though Sua insists on killing all the bio-mechanical soldiers, Mark convinces Sua to allow him to save Trent. While on a patrol, Kanya encounters a four-legged tanker alien and sacrifices herself by luring it into an old minefield left over from the Vietnam war. Though she destroys it, she unwittingly gives away their location to the alien ships searching for the human newborn child. They converge on the human base. During the resulting battle between the aliens and the humans, several members of the human resistance, including Harper, are killed. Mark enters a grounded alien ship, where he uses Harper's serum to turn the mind-controlling blue light into a red light that frees the mind-controlled bio-mechanical soldiers. Before he can deploy it, the alien leader and his horde of alien warriors attacks the human resistance and disables the light. Trent, his mind restored after encountering his father, fights back inside a giant alien tanker. While the alien leader is busy fighting Trent, the child fixes and deploys the red light, freeing the bio-mechanical soldiers, and Trent defeats the alien leader. With Earth saved, Audrey names the girl Rose after Mark's deceased wife. Ten years later, Rose, now a fully-grown adult, has taken control of an alien ship, and Trent is her second-in-command. Rose leads freed bio- mechanical soldiers and humans in an assault on the other alien ships around the Moon, including the mothership.

Characteristics Trichogaster fasciata is the largest gourami in its genus. It is an air-breathing fish, so that the aerial respiration is performed with the help of a pair of supra-branchial chambers, each containing a complicated labyrinthine organ. Body is elongated and compressed. Mouth is small and slightly protrusible. Preorbital serrate is found in young fish. Body color is greenish with oblique orange or bluish bars descending downwards and backwards from the back to the anal fin. It is benthopelagic and prefers weedy environments such as estuaries, ponds, large rivers, ditches, lakes and rice fields. The species has drawn attention for its scrumptious taste, contribution to nutrition and its ornamental value as an aquarium fish. It is somewhat shy but quite hardy, and easily adapts to life in community aquarium. It is also easy to breed in captivity. Banded gourami is being exported to Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and USA due to their distinctive color. In the past, the species was readily available in freshwater pools, ponds, ditches, marshes, rivers, lakes with vegetation, but the natural resources of this fish are declining fast due to various anthropogenic stressors. Feeding habit The mouth of this species is bordered by thick lips, the upper being protrudable and more pronounced in the male. Small and feeble teeth are present in the mouth and buccal cavity. The intestine is long and coiled. The fish is omnivorous in nature, so they can feed on live, frozen and flake feeds. Sexual dimorphism Males are much more colourful than females, and develop pointed dorsal and anal fins when they are mature. Reproduction The total life span of this species is approximately 4 years. Banded gourami has three distinctive life stages: pre-spawning (January‚ÄìMarch), spawning (April‚ÄìAugust) and post-spawning (September‚ÄìDecember). They become sexually mature at 1 year of age with the total length of male and female reached approximately at 10 cm and 6‚Äì8 cm, respectively. Generally males are slightly larger in size than their females. Male and female broods are distinguished by examining the gonads and based on the external morphological features: the upper lip of the male is more pronounced and the dorsal ventral fins are more pointed at the posterior end than those of the female. Like other Anabantoids, this species is a bubble nest builder and the fertilization is external. Taxonomy Trichogaster fasciata was formally described in 1801 by Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider with the type locality given as Tranquebar, a Danish trading post in India. It is the type species of the genus Trichogaster.

Biography Granville was born in Egypt, educated at Bloxham School and received his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He initially worked as a physician and house-surgeon at the West London Hospital in Maida Vale. He served in the South African War as a medical officer in the British Army. He subsequently joined the colonial Egyptian Government Service, where he would hold several important posts. Granville worked as inspector of the Public Health Department, director at the Ministry of Interior and Director-General of the Alexandria Municipality. Among his most important contributions was the decrease in the death rate in Cairo by improving the unsanitary conditions in the crowded streets, which had contributed to high mortality rate from disease. Granville became head of the Red Cross in Egypt. In 1916 he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. In early 1919 Granville represented Egypt at the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles. On 19 August 1919 he became the first president of the Labor Conciliation Board, an organisation established by Fuad I of Egypt to avert the risk of strike action in Egypt.'1919: Labour upsurge and national revolution', in The Modern Middle East: A Reader (University of California Press, 1993), 423.

In c. 643 Uthman ibn Abi al-As arrived at Bishapur with reinforcements from Basra and besieged the fortified town for several weeks before the town was forced to surrender.

Subsequent events  In 644, al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami, the Rashidun governor of Bahrain, once again attacked Fars, reaching as far as Estakhr, until he was repelled by the governor (marzban) of Fars, Shahrak. Some time later, Uthman ibn Abi al-As managed to establish at Tawwaj a Misr, a military base whose regimental system was based on the Immigrant Tribal (mainly Arabs) system, and shortly defeated and killed Shahrak near Rew-shahr (however other sources state that it was his brother who did it). A Persian convert to Islam, Hormuz ibn Hayyan al-'Abdi, was shortly sent by Uthman ibn Abi al-'As to attack a fortress known as Senez on the coast of Fars. After the accession of Uthman ibn Affan as the new Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 11 November 644, the inhabitants of Bishapur, under the leadership of Shahrak's brother, declared independence, but were defeated.

Unveiled on January 5, 2015, at the Consumer Electronics Show, the virtual multichannel video programming distributor aims to complement subscription video on demand services for cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated services that can be streamed through smart TVs, digital media players and apps. The service is available in the United States and Puerto Rico as of 2015. Sling TV is led by Erik Carlson who also serves as the President and COO of Dish Network. The service's precursor, the ethnic television service DishWorld, was also brought under the auspices of Sling TV LLC and was rebranded as Sling International. Following an invitation-only beta launch of the service that began in January of that year, Sling TV formally launched on February 9, 2015. , the service has 2.59 million subscribers. History Dish Network began to trial run an over-the-top (\\"OTT\\") internet television provider in 2012 with the launch of DishWorld, a service which provided access to over 50 ethnic and international television networks; DishWorld was initially made available through an app for Roku digital media players. In carriage deals that the company struck with major cable channel owners such as A&E; Networks, The Walt Disney Company and Scripps Networks Interactive during 2014, Dish Network obtained the over-the-top distribution rights to their networks as part of clauses incorporated into the agreements pertaining to its existing direct broadcast satellite service ‚Äì a move that served as a stepping stone for Dish towards launching a mainstream OTT offering. In November 2014, Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen explained that the company planned to launch its OTT service by the end of that year, and was aiming for the package to retail for around $30 per month. He explained: \\"the regular linear MVPD business is a mature business. You can't just go back every day and say 'I'm going to raise my rates to make my budget.' You have to figure out other revenue streams and get other people to pay for your product and watch more minutes of your product.\\" The OTT service was officially unveiled as Sling TV on January 5, 2015, in a presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas; the service is co-branded with the Sling entity owned by Dish Network's former parent Echostar, which also co-branded and provided placeshifting technology for the provider's Hopper with Sling multi-room DVR system. Dish did not provide any specific details on when the service would be launched, beyond \\"soon.\\" The company also announced that the DishWorld service would be absorbed into the Sling TV subsidiary and rebranded as Sling International, and that it also planned to launch a Sling Latino OTT service, which would incorporate various Spanish language networks. Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch explained that the service was designed to target the viewing habits of the 18‚Äì35 demographic, which he believed was being ignored by the traditional pay television industry (and is also represented by its slogan, \\"Take Back TV\\"). Lynch argued the service's approach required Dish to be selective in how it built the service's lineup, stating that \\"it would have been easy for us to do deals earlier on if we just agreed to say 'let‚Äôs just take these big pay TV packages and put them online.' We would have ended up with $60 or $70 bundles. We don't think that is the way to reach that demographic. We spent a lot of time working with programmers to make sure we had smaller bundles, lower costs and more flexibility.\\" He also noted the importance of reaching a deal to include ESPN onto the service, which he felt was a sign of validity for the provider. After a one-month, invitation-only beta, Sling TV officially launched on February 9, 2015. That same day, Sling announced that it had reached a carriage deal with AMC Networks, allowing networks such as AMC, IFC, BBC America and SundanceTV to be included as part of the service. One week later on February 16, as part of a renewed agreement between Dish and the Paramount Pictures/Lionsgate/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer joint venture Studio 3 Partners to continue its carriage on the company's satellite service, Sling announced that it would carry Epix as part of its \\"Hollywood Extra\\" tier ‚Äì in a package that includes its main channel and all three multiplex services ‚Äì becoming the first premium channel to be made available on the provider. Sling expanded its premium channel offerings on April 1, 2015, when Dish announced that it would add HBO to Sling TV as an add-on pack. Similar to the Epix deal, the addition of HBO was part of a wide-ranging deal between Dish Network and Time Warner that included the renewal of its carriage agreement for the Turner Broadcasting System's cable channels. Sling added HBO as an add-on pack ‚Äì which consists of the east and west coast feeds of the primary linear channel (although excluding its six multiplex services), and allows on-demand access to HBO's programming content ‚Äì on April 9, 2015. The Sling Latino service was introduced on June 4, 2015, featuring two add-on Spanish-language programming tiers, \\"Paquete Total\\" and \\"Paquete Esencial.\\" Customers can purchase two additional add-on packs, \\"Colombia\\" and \\"Espa√±a.\\" This service does not require the purchase of the \\"Best of Live TV\\" package. On November 19, 2015, Blockbuster LLC migrated the Blockbuster On Demand VOD service exclusively to Sling TV; as a result, Blockbuster and Dish Network began redirecting all Dish customers who subscribed to the service to switch to Sling in order to continue accessing its film content. On April 13, 2016, Sling TV introduced a \\"multi-stream\\" package, which allows the ability for up to three users to stream different channels through a single subscription account. The package includes several networks owned by 21st Century Fox, including FX, Fox Sports 1, National Geographic Channel and the regional Fox Sports Networks, but excludes networks owned by The Walt Disney Company (including ESPN, ESPN2, Disney Channel and Freeform) to hold the price of the tier at a moderated rate. Two months later on June 13, Sling added several channels to the multi- stream package: it added FS2, FXX and Nat Geo Wild among the Fox-owned offerings on the tier, and began carrying several channels owned by Viacom Media Networks (including MTV, VH1, BET, Spike, and Comedy Central). The Viacom deal ‚Äì a caveat of a carriage dispute that Viacom and Dish Network resolved with a renewed agreement to keep Viacom's channels on the satellite provider ‚Äì notably excluded Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite (although its three sister channels, Nick Jr., Nicktoons and TeenNick, were included, with Nick Jr. being placed on the single-stream service's \\"Kids Extra\\" add-on lineup and in the core package, alongside Comedy Central and BET, on the beta multi- stream offering), while several of Viacom's other flagship networks (including MTV, VH1, CMT, BET, Spike and TV Land) were primarily relegated to the service's \\"Comedy Plus Extra\\" and \\"Lifestyle Plus Extra\\" add-on packs. In addition, the service added support to allow access to its content on Apple TV devices. Sling restructured its programming tiers on June 30, 2016, redesignating the \\"Best of Live TV\\" single-stream tier as \\"Sling Orange\\" and the multi-stream package as \\"Sling Blue\\". Additionally, the service added most of the NBCUniversal family of networks (including USA Network, Bravo, Syfy, Golf Channel, CNBC, MSNBC, E!, Oxygen, NBC Universo, NBCSN and most of the regional Comcast SportsNet channels), as well as BBC America, BBC World News and Vibrant TV; the NBCUniversal channels joined sister service Local Now (an OTT-exclusive service of NBC-part-owned The Weather Channel), which initially launched as a Sling-exclusive offering on January 25. In addition, subscribers could also stream NBC stations in all markets where the network has an owned- and-operated station. With this, Sling began offering existing and prospective subscribers an upper-end tier comprising the channels featured on both Sling Orange and Blue, as well as those that are restricted to the respective tiers. Those subscribing to the \\"extra\\" add-on packs are required to subscribe to the Sling Orange tier in order to access the Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group channels and Sling Blue to stream the NBCUniversal channels included in the service's subtiers. Comcast SportsNet California, Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, Comcast SportsNet Chicago and Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic were not among the CSN networks initially available in markets served by those channels, and would not be added to Sling until April 2, 2017. On September 8, 2016, coinciding with the channel's September 10 premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Sling TV began carrying Starz as a premium add-on; its rollout was commemorated with a seven-day free preview of the Starz package to existing subscribers. The service also added the six regional Pac-12 Networks to its \\"Sports Extra\\" tiers, and added support for Windows 10 users through the launch of an app for the operating system. During October 2016, the service also added six additional channels to its lineup: Game Show Network (on the \\"Comedy Extra\\" tier), AXS TV (on the main \\"Sling Blue\\" lineup), HDNet Movies (on the \\"Hollywood Extra\\" tier), NHL Network (on the \\"Sports Extra\\" tier), Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (both on the \\"Lifestyles Plus Extra\\" tier). On November 2, the OTT business news service Cheddar was added to Sling's base tiers, while Sling Kids and TheBlaze respectively joined the Kids Extra and World News Extra tiers; two weeks later on November 16, NBA TV was added to the \\"Sports Extra\\" tier. In April 2017, Sling began offering Showtime as an add-on pack. The east and west coast feeds of the primary Showtime linear channel and its seven multiplex services are included in the package, which also grants access to Showtime's on-demand service; sister channels The Movie Channel and Flix have been excluded from the package ever since Showtime's addition to Sling. With the addition, Sling became the first over-the-top MVPD streaming service to offer all five major premium networks: HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Starz and Epix. This was followed on April 5, with the introduction of the \\"Heartland Extra\\" add-on tier (including six newly added channels, FamilyNet, Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel, PixL, World Fishing Network and RFD-TV), and expanded its \\"Best of Spanish TV\\" tier with the additions of Estrella TV, V-me Kids and El Financiero-Bloomberg TV. Maker and Polaris TV were removed from the service in May 2017. On June 14, 2017, Sling TV moved the El Rey Network from the Orange package to the Comedy Extra add- on. However, the channel remained in the Blue package. Subsequently, on July 12, concurrent with the addition of Showtime Family Zone, Sling added WeatherNation TV to the \\"News Extra\\" add-on pack. On March 29, 2019, Sling TV added MLB Network and MLB Strike Zone to its \\"Sports Extra\\" package. On July 26, 2019, Sling TV and Dish Network removed the regional Fox Sports Networks, as a result of Dish and Sling being unable to come to an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which had just acquired the networks from Disney (a byproduct of its acquisition of certain film and television assets from 21st Century Fox the year prior) through a joint venture with Entertainment Studios. Features and availability Sling TV was originally not designed to be a full substitute for a \\"traditional\\" pay television provider, but as a complement to subscription-based online services (such as Crunchyroll, DC Universe, Disney+, Funimation, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Prime Video, VRV and YouTube Premium). On February 22, 2017, Dish Network CEO Charlie Ergen said that although it was positioned as a complementary service, he considered Sling TV now to be \\"a direct replacement for cable and satellite.\\" The service originally had several limitations for contractual, economic, and technological reasons: only one stream could be used per account, there was no DVR functionality beyond the ability to pause and rewind programs, and the service did not offer local broadcast television stations or regional sports networks. Sling CEO Roger Lynch explained that including local broadcast stations and regional sports networks would drive up the price of the service from the high fees demanded by networks and station owners; he also cited that most cord cutters already have either an antenna or a subscription to a streaming service, such as Hulu, with which to view programming from the major broadcast networks. Despite these initial reservations, Sling has since begun offering owned-and-operated stations of ABC, NBC and Fox in select markets. , Sling TV does not carry CBS, Telemundo (either its national feed or local stations, nor its sister network NBC Universo, which has since been removed from the Sling Blue tier), affiliates of The CW and MyNetworkTV, member stations of PBS and its affiliated networks, and most independent stations. Sling subscribers with Channel Master DVR+ devices, which support antenna- based tuning capability, can access local broadcast stations independently of the Sling TV app. On December 15, 2016, Sling TV began invitation-only beta testing of a cloud DVR that would allow subscribers to record programs from select channels carried on its programming tiers; initially available as part of a phased rollout to select Sling TV subs who access the service on Roku players and enabled television sets, the DVR allows up to 100 hours of recording storage, the ability to record multiple programs simultaneously, and automatically manages storage space to by deleting the oldest \\"watched\\" recording when the storage capacity becomes full to make room for additional recordings. Due to contractual limitations, users are unable to record content from certain channels, particularly those owned by Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group. The cloud DVR expanded to Amazon Fire TV subscribers through a \\"First Look\\" early access program, which allows users to purchase up to 50 hours of content storage. In September 2020, Sling TV announced Sling Watch Party, a co-viewing feature that allows people from different locations to watch live TV together simultaneously. A unique function of Sling TV's implementation is the ability for text and video chat alongside live TV, which is an industry first. During the beta period, guests can join the Watch Party through free Sling TV accounts, however, the free access will only last until September 30, 2020. Supported devices Sling TV content can be streamed via a number of platforms: at launch, these included Android and Apple iOS devices; Android TV; Apple TV; macOS, and Windows computers; LG and Samsung smart TVs; and Amazon Fire TV, Nexus Player, Roku, and Xbox One devices. (Streaming of ESPN networks through WatchESPN is also offered to subscribers.) On January 5, 2016, Channel Master added a Sling TV app to its DVR+ products via a firmware update, allowing users to access Sling content through the device's channel guide; because of clauses in digital distribution rights Dish Network maintains with content providers, Channel Master users cannot record channels through the Sling TV app. Supported Sling TV devices include: TV- connected * AirTV Player * Amazon Fire TV * Android TV * Apple TV (4th Generation and Apple TV 4K) * Channel Master DVR+ * LG Smart TV (on webOS 3.0 or higher) * Mi Box * Roku * Xbox One * TiVo Stream 4K Mobile * Android mobile devices * iOS mobile devices (10.x or higher) * Chromecast (cast from mobile device) Computer * Linux * macOS * Windows (Windows 7 or higher) * Windows 10 (app store) Reception Sling TV was named the CES 2015 \\"Best Home Theater Product\\", \\"Best Software/App\\", and \\"Best in Show\\" by Engadget, for its clear goal and pricing, its \\"intuitive, user-friendly and surprisingly well-done\\" interface, and the fact that the service \\"may very well be the beginning of the end for traditional pay TV\\" in the United States. Some broadcasters have been hesitant about over-the-top services such as Sling TV, showing concern that they may undermine their carriage deals with larger conventional cable, satellite and Internet TV providers. Time Warner initially noted that the carriage of its channels on the service was only for a \\"trial\\" basis, while both Time Warner's CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and an analyst from investment firm Macquarie Capital claimed that current contract language in Dish's OTT carriage deals with the service's content distributors would cap the number of subscribers that the service is allowed to have at any given time to 5 million. Neither Dish Network or its content providers have confirmed any such cap. On April 4, 2015, some Sling TV users were affected by brief outages preventing them from streaming portions of TBS' coverage of an NCAA Final Four game between the Duke Blue Devils and Michigan State Spartans, prompting criticism of the service's technical issues over social media. On April 6, 2015, Sling TV said that the errors, which affected between 1,000 and 2,000 users, were the result of network server failures caused by high volumes of subscriber traffic (including by new users that signed up in time for the Final Four), explaining that \\"while the viewing experience was spot on for the vast majority our customers, we were able to rebalance traffic loads for those who were affected [through traffic redirection to a different network provider] and improve the experience for the remainder of the evening.\\" Roger Lynch later stated that the service would limit future outages by upgrading its software to automatically switch from the main to a backup provider during spikes in streaming demand. In July 2015, Sling TV accused NBC Owned Television Stations, a division of Comcast's NBCUniversal unit, of refusing to air advertising for the service on NBC owned-and-operated stations in major markets as a form of protectionism. CEO Roger Lynch stated that \\"Comcast has a demonstrated history of shutting down ideas it doesn't like or understand, predictably to its benefit and at the expense of consumers.\\" See also * AT&T; TV * FuboTV * HBO Now * Hulu with Live TV * LocalBTV * Locast * NowTV * Philo * PlayStation Vue * YouTube TV * CBS All Access References External links * Category:Internet properties established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Colorado Category:Internet television streaming services Category:Dish Network ","title":"Sling TV"},{"id":"44951453","text":"Sandip Kumar Basu (born 1944) is an Indian molecular biologist and the holder of the J.

For the year 2018, total revenue was Euro 5.0 billion. The company has offices in 43 countries and also operate casinos, including in locations such as Berlin and Santiago, Chile. The Novomatic Group consists of a three holding companies. In June 2016, Novomatic bought the UK gambling company Talarius from the Australian Tatts Group. Instant win and digital scratchcard provider, Gamevy, formed a partnership with Novomatic subsidiary, Novomatic Lottery Solutions (NLS), in November 2016. The tie-up presents NLS with an opportunity to focus on \\"the broader lottery demographic\\". Tuesday, March 24, 2020 History Johann Graf initially partnered with Gerhard Brodnik in the 1970s to start Brodnik & Graf, a company that was importing pinball machines from Belgium. In 1980, Brodnik decided to quit, and Graf oriented towards producing gaming machines under the Admiral brand. A number of Admiral branded casinos were opened. Novomatic expanded globally during the decade and vastly improved the technology. It was among the first gaming equipment manufacturers to use touch screen technology. Novomatic operates in over 80 countries and has more than 30,000 employees. Notable acquisitions In 2010, Novomatic expanded into online gaming business by acquiring controlling stake in London based Greentube studio. Greentube, in addition to their original content, is the main online publisher of already established Novomatic slot games. Greentube then purchased Canadian based Bluebat Games studio in 2015 to further expand its online presence. In 2018 Novomatic completed the purchase of 52% of Australian gaming equipment maker Ainsworth Game Technology Limited for around 300 million Euros. That was Novomatic's largest acquisition since the acquisition of Greentube in 2010. Controversies * The Novomatic subsidiary G. Matica had not installed the accounting system for the mandatory networking of machines with the Italian tax authorities and was sentenced in 2012 to a fine of 150 million euros. Novomatic considered the claim as \\"completely unjustified\\" and appealed against the first instance decision. In June 2014, Novomatic paid a settlement amount of ‚Ç¨ 47.5 million. derstandard.at * In 2009, the Polish government under Prime Minister Donald Tusk planned an increase in gambling levies to finance the budget for European Football Championship 2012 (co-organized with Ukraine). As a result, among other things, lobbyists of the gambling operators exerted influence on the Polish government members against this tax increase. The daily Rzeczpospolita published tape recordings of the Anti-Corruption Authority CBA as the so-called \\"Black Jack Gate\\". As a result of the publication, several Polish ministers resigned: Interior Minister Grzegorz Schetyna, Minister of Justice Andrzej Czuma and the Vice-Minister of Economy Andrzej Szejnfeld.

It is a part of their larger The Legend of Heroes franchise and itself consists of several distinct story arcs, including Trails in the Sky and Trails of Cold Steel. The series began with the release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky in 2004. The series was not localized outside of Japan until the 2010s, with Xseed Games managing it until NIS America took over by 2019. Trails has been noted by critics for its emphasis on worldbuilding and character-driven narratives. In total, the series had sold over five million copies by late 2020. Synopsis Trails is a series of fantasy turn-based role-playing video games by Nihon Falcom. Later entries in the series, such as the Cold Steel games, introduced more social simulation elements, akin to the Persona series. The series originally began as a numbered entry in The Legend of Heroes series with the release of The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky in 2004. Despite that, it had no narrative connection with earlier Legend of Heroes games and has since been considered its own distinct franchise. Trails is set on the continent of Zemuria, with the games taking place across several nations, including the Kingdom of Liberl, the city-state of Crossbell, the Erebonian Empire, and the Republic of Calvard. The majority of the games take place within a few years of each other and follow the same overarching narrative. Games The series is broken into three distinct story arcs: the Trails in the Sky trilogy, the Crossbell duology, and the Trails of Cold Steel quadrilogy. The series also has a few spinoffs. Trails in the Sky The games are set within the Kingdom of Liberl and follow Estelle and Joshua Bright, a pair of \\"bracers\\" which are an international group of hired help that help citizenry in need. Trails in the Sky The first game in the series was released in Japan in 2004 for the PC. It was shortly afterwards ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006. Due to its large amount of text, the game was not localized into English until 2011, when it was translated by Xseed Games. The game was also given a high definition port as part of Sony's PSP Remaster line of ports to the PlayStation 3 platform in late 2012, and an updated rerelease on the PlayStation Vita in 2015. Trails in the Sky SC The direct sequel was initially released in 2006 for the PC and 2007 for the PlayStation Portable in Japan. In 2013, Xseed Games announced that they would be working together with Carpe Fulgur in localizing SC, due to all the fan requests after the release of First Chapter. Initially announced for a mid-2014 release, it was later pushed back to late 2014. In December 2014, Carpe Fulgur head Andrew Dice announced that progress in translating the game was slowed by his struggle with depression and suicide. Dice handed over his work for Xseed employees to finish up, which, combined with unexpected difficulties during the QA testing of the game, resulted in the game's release being delayed into 2015. Like First Chapter, SC was also announced for a mobile phone port by Aeria Games that was apparently abandoned, and had a 2013 PlayStation 3 HD port and a 2015 PlayStation Vita updated rerelease. Trails in the Sky the 3rd Trails in the Sky the 3rd was released in Japan in 2007 for the PC and for the PlayStation Portable in 2008. As early as 2010, XSeed Games announced Falcom had given them the rights to release The 3rd in English, but due to the massive undertakings of the first two chapters, they did not actually begin work on translating it at that time, nor would they commit to doing so. In March 2016, Xseed announced they had begun work on it, and released it in 2017. Crossbell The \\"Crossbell arc\\" refers to two games set in the titular location, Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki. Zero no Kiseki Zero no Kiseki take place in Crossbell, a small country located between two great powers, and follows Lloyd Bannings, a rookie investigator with the Crossbell police, and his colleagues Elie McDowell, Randy Orlando, and Tio Plato. The game has never been officially localized in English, but has seen a fan translation known as Trails from Zero. Zero no Kiseki was released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable on September 30, 2010. On August 28, 2011, the game was ported to Microsoft Windows for release in China. This version was released in Japan on June 14, 2013. In 2012, it was released for the PlayStation Vita as Zero no Kiseki: Evolution, with improved visuals and more voice acting. The Evolution version received a remaster for the PlayStation 4, releasing in Japan under the title Zero no Kiseki Kai on April 23, 2020. No official English localization of the game exists, although a fan translation under the title of Trails from Zero was released on March 14, 2020. Ao no Kiseki Ao no Kiseki continues directly after the end of Zero no Kiseki. It was first released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable on September 29, 2011, later receiving a PC port in China. It was also released for the PlayStation Vita as Ao no Kiseki: Evolution, featuring improved visuals and more voice acting, where it released in Japan on June 12, 2014. The game also received a remaster for the PlayStation 4, releasing in Japan under the title Ao no Kiseki Kai on May 28, 2020. As with Zero no Kiseki, no official English localization of the game exists, although a fan translation under the title of Trails to Azure has been released. Trails of Cold Steel The story arc consists of four games set in the Erebonian empire and follows Rean Schwarzer and Class VII, a specialized group of students at a military academy. Trails of Cold Steel The game was first released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in Japan in September 2013. Xseed Games would later localize and publish the game in English regions in 2015. A port for Microsoft Windows was also released in 2017, which included additional English voice acting not seen in the original release. Another port for the PlayStation 4 was released in Japan in 2018, and worldwide the following year. Trails of Cold Steel II The game was released for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 in Japan in 2014, and was later localized into English and published by Xseed Games in North America in 2016. A port by Xseed for Microsoft Windows was released in February 2018, while a remastered version for the PlayStation 4 was released in Japan in April 2018 and worldwide in June 2019. Trails of Cold Steel III The game was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2017 and worldwide in October 2019. Ports for Nintendo Switch and Windows were also released in 2020. The game was the first in the series to be localized in English by NIS America and not Xseed Games. Trails of Cold Steel IV The game is the final entry of the Cold Steel quadrilogy. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2018 and is scheduled for a worldwide release in late 2020, with ports for Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows also being scheduled for 2021. Spinoffs / other Ys vs. Sora no Kiseki: Alternative Saga Ys vs. Sora no Kiseki: Alternative Saga is a crossover fighting game featuring characters from Trails and Falcom's Ys series. It released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable on July 29, 2010. Nayuta no Kiseki Nayuta no Kiseki is the only game to not take place within Zemuria, with the only official connection to the series being its namesake. It also differs by being an action role-playing game rather than turn-based. Akatsuki no Kiseki Akatsuki no Kiseki is an free-to-play online entry in the series. It was developed by UserJoy Technology, and first released in Japan as a browser game on August 31, 2016, before being ported to other platforms. Hajimari no Kiseki The Legend of Heroes: Hajimari no Kiseki was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan on August 27, 2020. Other media An OVA adaptation of Trails in the Sky SC, directed by Masaki Tachibana at the studio Kinema Citrus, was released on November 25, 2011, with a second part releasing on January 22, 2012. That same year, the OVAs were licensed by Sentai Filmworks for release in North America. Reception and sales The series has been noted by critics for its emphasis on worldbuilding and character-driven narrative.

His papers are housed in the Francis Wallace Collection, University of Notre Dame Archives.  Personal life  Francis Wallace was born in Bellaire, Ohio on February12, 1894, to John Simon Wallace (1848‚Äì1917) and Mary Griffin Wallace (1856‚Äì1932) who emigrated from Ireland to the United States in the 1870s. Wallace attended St. John Central Grade School and St. John Central High School, both in Bellaire. After graduation, Wallace reportedly worked in area railroad shops, glass factories, and steel mills for approximately seven years. He enlisted as a naval aviator but the armistice bringing World War I to an end was signed before he was deployed. In 1919, his siblings collectively recognized Wallace‚Äôs talents, pooled their resources, and helped to send him off to college at the University of Notre Dame. While at Notre Dame, Wallace studied philosophy. Perhaps the greatest influence in Wallace‚Äôs education, however, came while serving as a press intern for Knute Rockne. Wallace thus traveled with the team and worked with the legendary coach to package stories for the press. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1923. Wallace married Mary Heath (1902‚Äì1992) of Bellaire, Ohio in 1925, and their only child, John Francis Wallace was born in New York City in 1932. While Francis and Mary Wallace would also establish residences in Beverly Hills, California and in the Miami, Florida area over the course of their lives, they returned to Bellaire in the late-1930s and, in many ways, always considered it home. Mary served as a teacher and principal at St. John‚Äôs Central. Francis had a home office and even dabbled in politics‚Äîrunning as a Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives from his home district in Ohio. He lost but claims to have received the \\"intelligent vote\\". Wallace died in Cocoa Beach, Florida on August19, 1977. He and Mary are buried next to one another in the Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Bellaire, Ohio.  Professional life  After graduating from Notre Dame, Francis Wallace accepted a position as a night city editor for the Associated Press. He then served as a sportswriter for the New York Post and the New York Daily News. During that time, he authored the story detailing Knute Rockne‚Äôs \\"Win One for the Gipper\\" speech and popularized the Fighting Irish among the press in the Northeast as the mascot for the University of Notre Dame. He was also one of the earliest voices for the reform of college football. In 1927, he began writing fiction and non-fiction stories for a number of magazines. His first of seventeen books, Huddle!, was published in 1930 by Farrar & Rinehart. Several of those stories and books became the basis for motion picture screen plays. His first of seven motion pictures, Touchdown, was released by Paramount Pictures in 1931. Kid Galahad was released by Warner Bros. in 1937, and was remade by the Mirisch Company in 1962. In 1937, Wallace launched what would become an industry with the release of an annual college football preview. Between 1937 and 1948, Wallace‚Äôs predictions ran in The Saturday Evening Post under the title Pigskin Preview. From 1949 to 1956, Wallace‚Äôs predictions ran in Collier's under the title Annual Football Preview. After Collier's ceased publication, Wallace‚Äôs predictions ran in Playboy and returned to the title of Pigskin Preview. After learning that Playboy also published pornographic photos as part of its content, Wallace terminated the agreement he had struck with Hugh Hefner. By that time, the industry Wallace inspired was in full-swing as many other football predictions were on the market. Wallace‚Äôs prominence as a sportswriter led him to serve as a commentator for the CBS TV network and the ABC radio network. Toward the end of his career, however, he labored in a number of ways on behalf of his beloved alma mater. For example, he was elected as president of Notre Dame‚Äôs alumni association in 1949. His last three books were all non-fiction works that focused on various aspects of the university‚Äôs history and culture. He served on the Library Council and served as the inaugural chair of the Sports and Games Collection (now known as the Joyce Sports Research Collection). Mary Wallace also served on the Women‚Äôs Advisory Council for the university.  Work   Books  Books by Wallace: * Huddle!

Plot  Krishnendu is a brilliant, honest but short-tempered 3rd year medical student from a very poor family who is studying at the prestigious BIMS (Bengal Institute of Medical Science) near Kolkata. Juni is an arrogant, spoiled daughter of the renowned and influential cardiothoracic surgeon Samaresh Mukherjee. Juni joins BIMS as a first year student. Being raised in a rich and influential family, the rude reality of hostel life at BIMS made her situation very bad. A sequence of events unfolded dramatically that made Krishnendu and Juni enemies, and at the same time other separate incidents made Samaresh furious with Krishnendu. When Malabika (Juni's mother) saw Krishnendu for the first time, she found him strikingly similar to their old acquaintance Saradindu Sengupta. She secretly investigates, and comes to find out that Krishnendu is the son of Saradindu and Khuku-di (Kanika Sengupta). Meanwhile, slowly Juni realizes the good qualities of Krishnedu's character, and she begins to like him. They become friends. During this period, it was revealed to the audience that Saradindu is sentenced to 14 years in prison, which Samaresh was responsible for (this fact is not known to Krishnendu). Malabika meets Krishnendu secretly at the Principal (Mr Banerjee)'s office and requests him not to have contact with Juni anymore, as it could be harmful to both Juni and Krishnendu. Krishnedu begins to avoid Juni. The day Samaresh slapped and insulted Krishnendu at a party (to which Samaresh's family was invited and Krishnendu was working as a waiter to earn money to pay for his exam fees), Juni expressed her love for Krishnendu. However, Krishnendu refused. Juni tried sometimes in weird and innovative ways to make Krishnendu understand her true love for him. Finally, Krishnendu relents and accepts her love. In the meantime, Samaresh meets Dr. Kripalani (the hospital superintendent who doesn't like Krishnendu at all) and promised him the Principal's post if he can finish Krishnedu's career. Dr. Kripalani involved Meghna (a second year student and grand daughter of the famous and influential Dr. Subol Majumdar) in his evil plan to frame Krishnedu and defame his character. Meghna requested Krishnendu's help in her study and met him at a secluded place and pretended to be sick all on a sudden. When Krishnendu tried to help her, a photographer hired by Kriplani clicked some deceptively intimate photographs of Krishnendu and Meghna. As soon as Krishnendu understood that he had been framed he left the place hurriedly and was hit by a speeding car! He was admitted in critical condition to BIMS hospital. Juni requested everybody to conceal Krishnedu's identity so that Samaresh can operate Krishnendu and save his life. In the meantime, Ronit ( a newly appointed doctor at BIMS) joined hand with Meghna so that Juni and Krishnendu could be separated from each other. When Kanika came to know that Samaresh is Juni's father, she asked Krishnendu not to keep any relation with Juni any more. Ranit conspired with Meghna and showed Krishnendu and Meghna's intimate photos to Juni, which filled her heart with hatred for Krishnendu and decides to marry Ronit. Kanika's illness brought Juni and Krishnendu together again, and finally Krishnendu proved her innocence to Juni by showing a video that was shot along with the photographs by the same person. Juni blackmailed her mother Malabika to confess that Samaresh lied in the court to send Saradindu in to jail for rape and attempt to murder of nurse Arunima who was working in the same Blue Paradise Nurshing home where Saradindu and Samaresh were working as doctors . Juni started investigating on her own the truth behind Saradindu's conviction. Samaresh, Dr. Kriplani and Ronit framed Krishnedu again while he flouted hospital norms my treating an injured person (father of a student of BIMS) when no doctors were available. And Krishnendu was expelled from BIMS. All the students of BIMS protested against Krishnendu's rustication and were arrested as they sat on a hunger strike. At that point, being desperate to save Krishnedu's career, Juni struck a deal with Meghna and promised to go out of Krishnendu's life for ever. Meghna requested her grandpa Subol Majumdar, who used his influence to get Krishnendu back to BIMS once again and finally Meghna and Krishnendu became good friends. Subol Majumdar, who is respected by all, had some evil plans as well. At Subol's quarter Krishnedu got a letter written by Arunima with the allegation that Saradindu raped and tried to kill Arunima and because of this offence Saradindu is serving the jail sentence, that fills Krishnendu's heart with hatred for his father Saradindu. Juni's weird behaviour (of distancing herself from Krishnedu) and hatred for his own father, turned Krishnendu almost into an insane! Being released from jail after 14 years, Saradindu kidnapped Juni so that Samaresh confess to him about why did he lie against him before the court. Samaresh again lied and put the entire blame on Dr. Chandranath(Ronit's dad). When Saradindu confronts Chandranath, a sniper killed him and every body thought Saradindu murdered Chandranath to take revenge. Juni compels Samaresh to confess to Krishnendu that Saradindu is completely innocent. Juni, Krishnendu and Samaresh visits a mental asylum where Arunima is being treated since the brutal attack on her. Malabika evesdropped Samaresh's phone conversation and informed Juni and Krishnendu that Arunima will be killed that night in the asylum. Krishnendu, Juni and Meghna rescued Arunima and brought her to Subol's residence thinking it to be the safest place. Arunima was extremely scared when she saw Subol. When Krishnendu, Juni and Meghna left for BIMS, Subol tried to Kill Arunima; but Arunima fled from the house. Saradindu rescued her from the street and took her to his secret hiding. When Saradindu confronts Samaresh once again to extract the truth, Subol's goons shoot at Samaresh and Samaresh was admitted to BIMS. Subol finds out Saradindu's secret hiding and came to kill Arunima. Finally it was revealed that Subol is the main culprit and Arunima is Meghna's mother! Everybody (Juni, Krishnendu, Meghna, Arunima, Krishnendu's family, Juni's family) escaped from Subol's clutches and took shelter at Principal's residence at Kolkata. Meghna confessed to Krishnendu about the deal she had with Juni. Saradindu called Subol and told him that they are willing to meet him and surrender before him to have a peace deal! While talking to Subol, Saradindu tricked him to confess all his crimes which was secretly recorded by Krishnendu in his mobile phone. When all the evidence against Subol was aired on TV, police arrested Subol. While taking him to the police van, Subol got hold of a gun and killed Arunima and police shot Subol to death. Meghna donated all of Subol's property to BIMS and left BIMS along with Ronit and finally Samaresh accepts and arranges Krishnedu and Juni's marriage after they finished their study to become doctors.

The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640), quoting his source \\"Vincent upon Brooke and Mills\\", suggested he was lord of the manor of Spencer Combe in the parish of Crediton, Devon, which his ancestor Richard Spencer had inherited by marriage to Alice Hody, daughter of William Hody of Combe Lancells, whose own family had inherited it from the Lancells family.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, pp.100‚Äì101 However Risdon's contemporary Sir William Pole (d.1635) makes no mention of Sir Robert at Spencer Combe, and states that the estate descended via the heiress Jone Spencer to the Giffard family.Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John- William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.227 His origin at Spencer Combe is however traditional, and is given thus in most published pedigrees and rolls of arms.e.g. Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.438, arms of Cary, Viscount Falkland, the 3rd quarter is given as \\"Spencer of Spencer Combe\\" The American genealogist Douglas RichardsonRichardson, Douglas, Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, Baltimore, Maryland, Genealogical Publishing Co, 2004, p.480, pedigree of Carey suggests that Sir Robert Spencer was in fact the son and heir of John Spencer, Esquire, MP for Dorset, of Frampton in Dorset, Ashbury in Devon and Brompton Ralph in Somerset, by his wife Jone.

He was the starting quarterback at Tyler Junior College in 1949, at the Texas Longhorns in 1951 and for the Fort Sill football team in 1953-54. He was the last transfer student to start at quarterback at Texas. Early life Dan Page was born in 1930 in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. He played high school football at Leverett's Chapel High School. He was the older brother of Bobby Page, who also was a star quarterback at Tyler Junior College and went on to start for Oklahoma in the early '60's. Bobby Page became the first Oklahoma Sooners quarterback to run and pass for over 100 yards in the same game. College Football At Tyler Junior College, Page was a Little All-American in 1949 and was named the Most Valuable Player in U.S. junior college football. He led Southwest Junior College Conference in passing that year, and led the team to a co-conference championship, a 10-1 record and a trip to the Texas Rose Bowl against the Fort Lewis team, which they won 40-0. He was recruited by Texas and went on to play for them in 1950 and 1951, becoming the starting quarterback by the end of his senior year. He is the last transfer, junior college or otherwise, to start at quarterback at Texas. In 1950, Page was the backup quarterback to Ben Tompkins, but managed to play in every game as either quarterback or defensive back. The team went 9-2, won the Southwest Conference championship and lost to Tennessee in the Cotton Bowl. In 1951, the first season with coach Ed Price, Page was set to compete with T Jones and Tompkins for the starting role. But when Tompkins left in the winter to play professional baseball, Jones got the start in the opener. Page saw some playing time in the early games as Texas climbed to #4 in the rankings. Then they were upset by Arkansas, a team they had not lost to since 1938. In that game Jones and Page combined for 1-12 passing, with Page making the only completion, and lost by 2 on a Pat Summerall field goal. Jones started the following game against Rice, but Page led the Longhorns to the win and took over as starter for the rest of the season. After beating SMU, Texas lost to #16 Baylor for the first time since 1938. The following week, Page led Texas to an upset of #12 TCU, throwing for 175 yards and 2 touchdowns to set a pair school records, including the record for most yards gained per pass attempt - which he still holds. In the final game, Texas needed to beat Texas A&M; for a share of the conference title and a trip to the Orange Bowl, but despite 150 yards passing by Page, Texas was upset 22-21 and beaten by A&M; for the first time since 1939. Immediately following the 1951 season, Page was briefly involved in a recruiting scandal involving former Kansas State coach Ralph Graham. Graham said that Kansas State had given money to a Tyler Junior College player, in violation of the rules, who chose to go to Texas and so attention immediately turned to Page. However, a few days later, Tyler JC coach Floyd Wagstaff identified the player as Alvin Beal, and Graham confirmed it. Beal did not got to Texas but instead went into the army and denied ever being paid. After graduation, Page went to Fort Sill, OK to fulfill his military service commitment. He played for the Fort Sill football team and led them to the Fourth Army football championship in 1953 and was named to the All-Army team that year. In 1954, he led Fort Sill to a victory over Bolling Air Force Base in the Poinsettia Bowl and thus the Armed Forces Football Championship. Records * UT - Highest Average Gain per pass completion, game (min 5. completions) (29.2), surpassed by Robert Brewer in 1982 * (Active) UT - Highest Average Gain per pass attempt, game (min 7 attempts) (25.0) Later life After completing his military service, Page moved from Fort Sill, Oklahoma to Fort Worth, Texas. From 1962 to 1968, he worked with Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages and then he became founder, owner, president and publisher of Executive Data Services, Suburban Yellow Pages in 1970 in Dallas. He died on November 23, 1995.

Etter died in 1950 before completing the patent filing, and it was later rediscovered and renamed as 'Crimson Gold'.Green Mantle Nursery: The Ettersburg Apple LegaciesRittman Orchards The skin of 'Crimson Gold' has a yellow background which is visual only at the shaded areas of the skin and around the stem. Otherwise it is covered with a ruby red. Flesh is crisp, with a balance of sweet and tart. Delicious for fresh eating, and also good for baking, retains its shape and texture even with high temperature. In fact, when the apple was rediscovered, about 1970, on a single limb of an old test orchard, Etter's \\"boil test\\" was used to confirm that the found apple was in fact Crimson Gold/Little Rosybloom. The genuine apple holds its shape after 2 hours of boiling, while the similar Wickson Crab, also an Etter introduction, does not. Things became confused when \\"Svatava\\" a totally different, modern, variety from Europe, was introduced under the same name, \\"Crimson(r) Gold\\".

A nationalist activist during World War I, he became noted for his pioneering research into the biostatistics of Transylvania and Banat regions, as well as a promoter of eugenics and social interventionism. As a bio- and geopolitician, ManuilƒÉ advocated the consolidation of Greater Romania through population exchanges, colonization, state-sponsored assimilation, or discriminatory policies. ManuilƒÉ entered national politics in the early 1930s, representing the National Peasants' Party as a junior cabinet member. A disciple of the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, who obtained him a membership in the Romanian Academy, he directed Romania's first Statistical Institute. During World War II, he rose to prominence as an expert adviser of Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu, applauding the antisemitic legislation and making antiziganism an official policy of the Romanian state. He was among the first intellectuals to propose the deportation of Romanian Jews and Romanies into occupied Transnistria. Additionally, ManuilƒÉ involved himself in the diplomatic standoffs between Romania and the Kingdom of Hungary, fighting against the loss of Northern Transylvania, then campaigning for her recovery. By 1944, ManuilƒÉ was an Antonescu opponent, and involved himself in the August coup that toppled him. He remained active on the political scene even after the start of Soviet occupation, serving as Undersecretary of State on two successive coalition governments. He fell out with the Romanian Communist Party, and escaped the country before the imposition of a communist regime, rallying with the Romanian National Committee. He lived his final years in the United States, employed by Stanford University and the Census Bureau. Biography Early life and activism ManuilƒÉ was born in S√¢mbƒÉteni, Arad County, on the traditional border between the regions of Banat and Cri»ôana, both of which were then in Austria-Hungary. He was the son of Fabriciu ManuilƒÉ, a Romanian Orthodox archpriest from Lipova. As an ethnic Romanian activist, Father Fabriciu had been fighting the region's Magyarization, joining efforts with Sabin's uncle, Vasile Goldi»ô, who was a prominent militant in the Romanian National Party.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 128 As noted by scholar M. Benjamin Thorne, the ManuilƒÉ family also harbored racist prejudice against the Romanies (Gypsies), which may have shaped Sabin's political stances.Thorne, p. 185 He was educated at home and later graduated high school in Bra»ôov. Since he could not pursue his studies in Romanian, Sabin entered the medical faculty of Budapest University in 1912, but remained active in Romanian nationalist circles, and published articles in political newspapers.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 128‚Äì129 He interrupted his studies from 1914 to 1918, taking part in World War I. A medic in the Austro-Hungarian Army, he saw action on the Russian Front,Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 129 and was wounded.Dan Dungaciu, Elita InterbelicƒÉ: Sociologia rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn context european, p. 232. Editura Mica Valahie, Bucharest, 2011, Wedekind, p. 55 By November 1918, following the split of Austria-Hungary and the democratization of Hungary, ManuilƒÉ was working as a physician in Lipova.Moldovanu, p. 134 He resumed his nationalist activities in support of Cri»ôana and Transylvania's union with Romania, joining the Romanian National Guard and becoming its local commander. In December, he was called upon by his university colleagues to represent them at the Alba Iulia grand national assembly, where he voted for union with Romania.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 129; Moldovanu, pp. 133‚Äì134, 162, 163, 164, 168, 171 The motion for union was read out by his uncle, Goldi»ô; Fabriciu and Sabin's brother, Camil ManuilƒÉ, were also present.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 128, 129 In 1919, he obtained his doctorate in medicine.Moldovanu, p. 162 In 1920, he married Veturia Leucu»õia, a Banat native who would later become a doctor and set up an infrastructure for nursing education in Romania. She had also been a student representative at Alba Iulia.Moldovanu, pp. 134, 152, 161, 162 Sabin was soon after employed by Cluj (Babe»ô-Bolyai) University, first as head of its children's hospital and assistant lecturer to Victor Babe»ô, then as head the social hygiene department.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 129‚Äì130; Moldovanu, pp. 162, 173 His scientific, teaching and publishing career took off between 1919 and 1926. He collected thousands of blood samples throughout Transylvania, pioneering the study of serology and immunology, and publishing his findings in Western scientific journals.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 130 During this period, he also began writing articles about epidemiology and the healthcare system's organization. His monograph on Epidemiile din Transilvania (\\"Epidemics in Transylvania\\") was presented by Babe»ô to the Romanian Academy, earning ManuilƒÉ the Academy Prize for 1921. His project doubled as an inquiry into racial science: ManuilƒÉ followed Ludwik Hirszfeld's ideas about the \\"racial index\\", concluding that there existed a distinct serological cluster of Balkan peoples, of which Romanians were a distinct subtype. The conclusion was discussed by other serologists: Gheorghe Popoviciu, who concluded that ManuilƒÉ's data were flawed, and that Romanians were not a race apart; and Petru R√¢mnea»õeanu, who believed that ManuilƒÉ was largely correct.Turda, pp. 424‚Äì429.

Van Campenhout, Brussels, 1929, p. 433 Also in 1927, ManuilƒÉ moved to the national capital Bucharest, where he began collaborating with Dimitrie Gusti and with the statistical school of Octav Onicescu. Focusing on biopolitics, his research took him into the exploration of local demographics and demographic history. He was especially active in the field of \\"ethnodemographic prognosis\\", one of the first and few Romanians who took up this chore.Achim (2005), p. 141 According to fellow statistician Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, his \\"organisation of Romania's vital statistics was an international paragon\\".Georgescu-Roegen, p. 24 In 1929, he entered Gusti's Romanian Social Institute, and that year, together with five other doctors, he participated in a Gusti-coordinated monograph-writing campaign at DrƒÉgu»ô village in the vicinity of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô.Stahl, pp. 148‚Äì149 As such, he led operations for the nationwide census of 1930, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation,Co»ôovanu, p. 3; Petraru, p. 139 subsequently leading the Institute of Demography and Census. At the Social Institute, with Gusti's consent, he established a section for eugenics and biological anthropology.Bucur, pp. 75, 318 Supervised by Gusti and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, ManuilƒÉ and his wife also created a Bucharest School of Social Work, which doubled as an institute for the propagation of eugenic ideals.Bucur, pp. 15, 20, 74, 238‚Äì240 It was located on YMCA grounds, and had Henri H. Stahl, Francisc Rainer, Gheorghe Banu, Mircea VulcƒÉnescu and Xenia Costa-Foru among its lecturers.Bucur, p. 239; Stahl, pp. 148‚Äì149, 189‚Äì192 At the time, ManuilƒÉ himself made groundbreaking discoveries about the demography of Transylvania and the Romanianization of its cities. In 1929, he put out the treatise Evolu»õia demograficƒÉ a ora»ôelor »ôi minoritƒÉ≈£ilor etnice din Transilvania (\\"The Demographic Evolution of Cities and Ethnic Minorities in Transylvania\\"), which earned him another Academy prize.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 131 He made projects about population exchanges between Greater Romania and its various neighbors, with the goal of discarding \\"elements with a centrifugal tendency\\" and keeping \\"ethnic purity\\", and even proposed the colonization of his native Cri»ôana with Romanians from Hungary.Achim (2001), pp. 594‚Äì596, 598‚Äì601. See also Wedekind, p. 54 Moreover, ManuilƒÉ campaigned for the adoption of social welfare and biopolitical laws that, he argued, would curb emigration from RomaniaAchim (2001), p. 595 and promote the consolidation of a Romanian urban society.Bucur, pp. 192‚Äì193 However, he believed that Romanianization was largely a natural phenomenon, and a facet of urbanization: the Romanian rural majority of the Austro-Hungarian period was moving into the cities. Uniquely among Romanian eugenicists, he endorsed fully the abortion-rights option, noting that natalism, while practical, should never infringe on a woman's informed choice.Bucur, pp. 274‚Äì275 ICS foundation Active politically, ManuilƒÉ joined the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö), Lavinia Betea, Cristina Vohn, \\"Inedit. Primul ziar legal al PCdR a fost falsificat\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, October 25, 2005 and began corresponding on social matters with the International Agrarian Bureau.Co»ôovanu, p. 6 From 1927 to 1930, he was a high- ranking civil servant within the Labor, Health and Social Protection Ministry, and was Undersecretary of State in a PN»ö cabinet, under Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu.Granville, p. 73 He later became Maniu's adviser in matters of sociology.Moldovanu, p. 163 He represented Romania at congresses held by the International Statistical Institute, the International Institute of Sociology, the League of Nations Committee on Population, and International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP). He sided with Corrado Gini's wing of the IUSSP, which promoted the natalist and racialist dogmas of Italian fascism.Turda & Gillette, pp. 170, 172 In 1933, the advent of Nazi Germany brought racism into the focus of Romanian intellectuals. In a 1934 interview, ManuilƒÉ expressed biopolitical reserves about Nazi racial doctrines. Although he believed in the \\"evident scientific facts\\" of racial determinism, he observed that \\"racial science\\" was still \\"young\\", and argued that Nazis were \\"compromising\\" the racial agenda. He also stated that Romanian Jews were \\"not a racial, but an economic problem, to which was added a sentimental factor\\".M., \\"Problema raselor pusƒÉ la punct de D. Dr. Sabin ManuilƒÉ\\", in Realitatea IlustratƒÉ, Nr. 389, July 8, 1934, pp. 12‚Äì13 In August 1935, he was Vice President of the IUSSP Congress in Berlin, which was effectively a propaganda display for Nazi biopolitics, with Eugen Fischer as the host.Turda & Gillette, pp. 172‚Äì173 By the end of the decade, ManuilƒÉ became convinced about the dangers of miscegenation, an idea which came to him from fellow sociologist Iordache FƒÉcƒÉoaru.Butaru, pp. 234‚Äì235; Solonari, p. 101 Returning to the Institute of Demography and Census, ManuilƒÉ helped Gusti organize another expedition, this time to his native S√¢mbƒÉteni (1934), and studied first-hand the region's depopulation.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 130‚Äì131 He also refocused on his eugenic projects: in 1935, he helped establish the Romanian Royal Eugenics Society (presided upon by Gheorghe Marinescu), also attending the Congress of Latin Eugenic Societies in Mexico City.Turda & Gillette, p. 176, 178‚Äì180 Also that year, he addressed a memo to the Ministry of Education, proposing to assimilate, peacefully but resolutely, Romania's Hungarian- speaking Sz√©kelys.Bottoni, p. 486; Livezeanu, p. 139. See also Wedekind, p. 33 He also insisted on his old idea of \\"eradicating\\" the Hungarians of Cri»ôana and bringing in their stead Romanians stranded across the border in Hungary, and demanded a strict policy of linguistic discrimination in Transylvania- proper.Livezeanu, pp. 142‚Äì143 Nonetheless, ManuilƒÉ toned down the racialism of other eugenicists, who wanted the Sz√©kelys and their Csango relatives to be counted as separate from Hungarians, based on claims that both of the former had Romanian ancestry. He reputedly based his rejection on a linguistic rationale, as all three communities were Hungarian-speaking.Bottoni, pp. 496‚Äì497 In 1937, Sabin ManuilƒÉ was an official host, and Veturia a guest speaker, at the Bucharest Anthropological Congress, placed under the patronage of King Carol II.Turda & Gillette, pp. 191‚Äì193 From 1938, ManuilƒÉ headed his own Central Statistical Institute (Institutul Central de StatisticƒÉ, ICS), while also serving as Secretary General of the Statistical Society, seconding Gusti. This move was a sign of his quarrels with Moldovan, who nevertheless continued to influence the ManuilƒÉ's work.Bucur, p. 74 His new research produced several detailed monographs, including a 1937 study on Popula»õia Rom√¢niei (\\"The Population of Romania\\"),Co»ôovanu, p. 3 and a 1938 Romanian encyclopedia (Enciclopedia Rom√¢niei), which detailed and examined the 1930 census data.Mihai Maci, \\"The Impossible Secularization\\", in William DancƒÉ (ed.), Faith and Secularation. A Romanian Narrative (Romanian Philosophical Studies, IX; Christian Philosophical Studies, VII). Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, Washington, D.C., 2004, , p. 145 Dealing with the Great Depression, his articles of the time discuss the \\"overpopulation\\" of Romania's universities as a cause of white-collar unemployment, proposing a government selection of the human capital.Bucur, pp. 188, 331 However, when Carol II ordered him to estimate the number of jobless people with a college diploma, ManuilƒÉ counted 6,000 individuals, which was well below official expectations.Traian Sandu, \\"La g√©n√©ration fasciste en Roumanie: recrutement, doctrine, action\\", in Histoire, √âconomie & Soci√©t√©, Vol. 22, Issue 22‚Äì23, 2003, p. 440 World War II racism ManuilƒÉ had a sinuous career during the first years of World War II, when his interest shifted toward geopolitics and historical geography. In 1938, upon Gusti's recommendation, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy; until 1940, he was also a department head within Banu's Institute of Hygiene and Public Health. In 1939, Carol II's National Renaissance Front (FRN) terminated ManuilƒÉ's ICS, and all statisticians were left unemployed. Sanda Golopen»õia, \\"Via»õa noastrƒÉ cea de toate zilele\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 486, August 2009 During 1940, the regime again appealed to ManuilƒÉ's expertise. At the time, Romania had abandoned its friendship with the Western Allies, and was testing a rapprochement with Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers. This, however, meant negotiating territorial exchanges with the Nazi-backed Kingdom of Hungary. With Mihail Manoilescu and other Foreign Affairs officials, ManuilƒÉ attended the meeting in Turnu Severin, where the Romanian side first took into consideration population exchanges between Romania and Hungary.Achim (2001), pp. 596‚Äì598; (2005), p. 141. See also Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 132 In the end, a Nazi-mediated Vienna Award carved out the region of Northern Transylvania and assigned it to Hungary. ManuilƒÉ was present at the proceedings.Achim (2005), p. 147 The ICS returned to prominence in late 1940: following the Award and the political turmoil it generated, Romania became a National Legionary State, ruled over by Ion Antonescu. ManuilƒÉ and his staff were directly subordinated to the ConducƒÉtor, \\"substantiating governmental policy decisions\\" and, after Romania's entry into the conflict as a Nazi ally, making demographic projects in view of a future peace.Achim (2001), pp. 598‚Äì599; (2005), p. 141, 142‚Äì143, 149. See also Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 133; Deletant, pp. 187, 329, 331 Historian Viorel Achim noted in 2005: \\"Marshal Antonescu and other high-ranking officials would consult him on every population policy issue. While they did not always take his advice, he usually succeeded in bringing them round to his views.\\" Historian Vladimir Solonari notes that Antonescu's ascendency signified ManuilƒÉ's own promotion: \\"Antonescu [...] absolutely trusted his expertise\\", and presented the ICS with a state monopoly on statistical research. Also according to Solonari, ManuilƒÉ transformed himself into \\"an enthusiastic supporter\\" of Nazi racial policies, \\"that he now wanted to introduce in Romania.\\"Solonari, p. 102 The ICS remained \\"the most important\\" instrument of \\"ethnopolitics\\", and as such mediated between Antonescu and Nazi racial scientists, in particular members of the Expert Committee on Questions of Population and Racial Policy.Achim (2005), pp. 143‚Äì145 ManuilƒÉ built contacts with Friedrich Burgd√∂rfer, Wilfried Krallert, and Alessandro Molinari.Achim (2005), pp. 145‚Äì150 As scholar Maria Bucur writes, ManuilƒÉ made a transition to the far-right, but without establishing \\"explicit links\\" with the governing Iron Guard.Bucur, pp. 38‚Äì39 When the Iron Guard was eventually banned, following the rebellion and pogrom of January 1941, its leadership insisted that Veturia ManuilƒÉ had played a hand in the affair. They cited her as an anti-Guardist influence on the dictator's wife, Maria Antonescu. Jean Ancel, \\"Anatomia unei repetate falsificƒÉri\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 864, October 2006 ManuilƒÉ did however support the passage of Jewish segregation laws, adopting the corollaries of economic antisemitism, according to which Jewish wealth and influence needed to be kept in check.Achim (2005), pp. 142, 146‚Äì147; Bucur, pp. 203, 252; Deletant, p. 105 Ukrainians in light green (concentrated in Transnistria, Bukovina and the Budjak), with Jews in yellow, Germans in red, and Hungarians in dark green. Romanies shown as slivers of light brown, with higher concentrations in Bucharest and Oltenia ManuilƒÉ's antisemitism was more nuanced than the Guard's own policies. In his 1940 article about \\"racial commands\\", where he proposed to create a \\"Superior Council for the Protection of the Race\\",Turda, p. 438 ManuilƒÉ insisted that the Jews were a largely harmless community, both self-segregated and endogamous.Bucur, pp. 202‚Äì203, 333; Thorne, p. 186; Turda & Gillette, p. 229 He elaborated on this issue with articles hosted by the Deutsches Archiv f√ºr Landes- und Volksforschung (1941), describing the \\"Jewish Question\\" in Romania as \\"qualitative\\", not \\"quantitative\\", and insisting that the Jewish population figures circulated in Romanian antisemitic circles were unrealistic.Achim (2005), pp. 146‚Äì147 Instead, he claimed that \\"Romania's racial issue\\" was to be found among the Romanies (Gypsies), whom he described as \\"dysgenic\\", subversive, and exogamous.Bucur, pp. 202‚Äì203, 333; Thorne, pp. 185‚Äì187, 202; Turda & Gillette, p. 229. See also Turda, p. 438 He endorsed their compulsory sterilization.Thorne, pp. 185‚Äì187, 202; Turda & Gillette, pp. 229, 230 This idea was supported by Burgd√∂rfer, who described the Romanies as being of \\"capital importance\\" among Romania's issues in racial hygiene.Achim (2005), p. 145 ManuilƒÉ soon began work on a new census, \\"a giant, extremely complex operation\\" which was intended to give added weight to Romania's claims on her neighbors.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 133 According to historian Victor Neumann, this enterprise was also notable for the \\"ideologized criteria and notions\\" which it vented in its published form.Victor Neumann, \\"Timi»ôoara between 'Fictive Ethnicity' and 'Ideal Nation'. The Identity Profile during the Interwar Period\\", in Balcanica, Vol. XLIV, 2013, p. 395 A special section of the census involved the cataloging of all Jewish property, a summary of which was sent to the German Main Security Office.Wedekind, p. 62 ManuilƒÉ also advised government to add the criminal status of Romani individuals in its census data, including sentences for being \\"work-shy\\".Thorne, p. 202 ManuilƒÉ and Transnistria deportations In late 1941, with Romania's participation on the Eastern Front as a German ally, ManuilƒÉ again proposed, in his memos to Antonescu, a population exchange, meaning to solve the issue of Northern Transylvania. He and Antonescu discussed this matter face to face, during a meeting in the Bessarabian town of Tighina.Wedekind, p. 58 ManuilƒÉ also envisaged the mass return of ethnic Romanians from Bulgaria and Serbia, the eventual relocation to Germany of all Germans in Romania, and a voluntary repatriation of the Csangos and Romanian Turks.Achim (2001), pp. 593, 598‚Äì606, 608; (2005), p. 142. See also Wedekind, pp. 57‚Äì61 He later advised Antonescu on resettling scattered communities of Romanian Ukrainians into the more compact Transnistria.Achim (2005), p. 143; Deletant, p. 175; Wedekind, pp. 60‚Äì65 These were to be then moved in other areas, where they were to replace Jews, Ukrainians and Russian Bessarabians‚Äîa measure that was actually set in motion in November 1941.Wedekind, pp. 60‚Äì65 ManuilƒÉ also discussed Romania's new shape in the New Order, proposing a revision of Greater Romania's pre-1940 borders, excluding most of Southern Dobruja. The country was to annex Pokuttya and B√©k√©scsaba, but not Transnistria. She was also to cede much of Hotin, Storojine»õ and CernƒÉu»õi counties to a Nazified Ukraine, and some western areas (including Salonta, Oradea and Satu Mare) to Hungary.Achim (2001), pp. 601‚Äì607; Wedekind, pp. 59‚Äì61 Some references were made to the Timok Valley and the traditional homelands of the Aromanians, but the project made no explicit annexation proposal concerning those lands.Wedekind, pp. 58‚Äì59 More significantly, the paper also envisaged the unilateral deportation to Transnistria of all Romanian Jews and Romanies, identifying them as stateless peoples with no outside protection.Final Report, p. 227; Achim (2001), p. 605; (2005), pp. 142, 147; Deletant, p. 188; Brigitte Mihok, \\"Verdr√§ngte Erinnerung.

Geschichte und k√ºnstlerische Verarbeitung, B√∂hlau Verlag, Weimar, 2008, , p. 30; Wedekind, pp. 57‚Äì58 This measure was supposed to enforce Romania's \\"ethnic homogeneity\\", and was presumably influenced by ManuilƒÉ's confidence in Moldovan's eugenic movement,Achim (2005), p. 147; Solonari, p. 101 but did not, in fact, call for the physical elimination of either community.Achim (2001), pp. 601‚Äì607 The ManuilƒÉ's working relationship with Antonescu also involved them in other issues specific to the Holocaust in Romania. Veturia ManuilƒÉ worked with Maria Antonescu on the state-run charity office, called Patronage Council. Ioan Scurtu, \\"¬´Cucoanele¬ª mare»ôalului Antonescu\\", in Historia, August 2013 In addition to its social work attributes, the institution was involved in extorting Jews who were subject to deportation.Final Report, p. 214; Bucur, pp. 287‚Äì288; Deletant, pp. 123, 313; Mariana Hausleitner, \\"Auf dem Weg zur ¬ªEthnokratie¬´.

Maison des Sciences de l'homme, Paris, 2002, , 188, 300‚Äì301, 357‚Äì358 In 1942, ManuilƒÉ's demographic inspections in Transnistria made him a silent witness of the 1941 Odessa massacre and death marches to Berezivka. Later that year, Transnistria Governor Gheorghe Alexianu ordered ManuilƒÉ and FƒÉcƒÉoaru to carry out an anthropometic study of the Romanian soldiers, to gather evidence on possible Jewish exogamy. In 1943, Antonescu assigned ManuilƒÉ, FƒÉcƒÉoaru, and Banu to a governmental task-force \\"for the Promotion and Protection of the Biological Capital of the Nation\\"; Moldovan was its chairman.Turda & Gillette, pp. 231‚Äì232 According to Achim, the population-exchange texts do not exhibit a racist agenda, and are also \\"non-imperialistic\\". They are \\"in unison\\" with Antonescu's policies of ethnic cleansing, but were not in themselves the basis of a government program.Achim (2001), p. 607. See also Achim (2005), p. 142 Nonetheless, one of the memos stands as a historical premiere, since ManuilƒÉ made official claims about a \\"Gypsy problem\\", again describing the Romanies as a \\"dysgenic\\" threat,Deletant, pp. 187‚Äì188; Solonari, pp. 102‚Äì103; Thorne, pp. 186‚Äì187, 202 \\"social and national non-values, and a racial hazard\\".Andrei Oi»ôteanu, Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, 2009, , p. 13 He also assessed that Romanies had been systematically under-counted in the 1930 census,Solonari, pp. 102‚Äì103 and that this apparent assimilation reflected \\"extreme humanitarianism\\" on the Romanian side, and had gone on for far too long. According to scholar Dennis Deletant, this approach is \\"redolent of Nazi ideology\\", seeking \\"scapegoats for the woes of the Romanian people\\".Deletant, p. 188 Both Deletant and Thorne note that ManuilƒÉ's eugenic ideas about the Romanies did in fact shape Antonescu's \\"ethnic policies\\", leading to the Romanies' deportation.Deletant, p. 189; Thorne, pp. 181, 186‚Äì187, 202 1944 Coup and aftermath Despite his official positions and involvement in racial projects, ManuilƒÉ was still affiliated with the PN»ö, which was in the semi-clandestine opposition to Antonescu. Radu Lecca, an Antonescu adviser who oversaw the deportations to Transnistria, later claimed that ManuilƒÉ was spying on the regime for the Americans.Achim (2005), p. 151 As noted by Achim: \\"ManuilƒÉ, despite his antiminority opinions, was perceived by many contemporaries, both before and after the war, as a democrat.\\"Achim (2005), p. 140 At the ICS, he revived Gusti's old team in 1941, assigning them their own Office for Studies.Achim (2005), pp. 142‚Äì143 He therefore collaborated with sociologists of all backgrounds: leftists such as Stahl and Anton Golopen»õia, alongside FƒÉcƒÉoaru, arrested by Antonescu for his role in the Iron GuardBoia, pp. 224, 235 (Golopen»õia was directly involved in the project to resettle Romanians from Ukraine to Transnistria).Achim (2005), p. 143; Impey, pp. 281‚Äì282; Wedekind, pp. 61, 63‚Äì64 With ManuilƒÉ's acquiescence, members of this team extended their protection to some 5,000 Jews, employing them at the ICS and preventing their deportation or internment in labor camps.Boia, p. 235 This was contrary to ManuilƒÉ's regular agenda: in early 1942, he himself had sent Antonescu notes about deporting all \\"useless\\" Jews, the latter being defined by race. According to Bucur, both ManuilƒÉ and FƒÉcƒÉoaru were probably informed that the deportees were being decimated on arrival by a massive typhus epidemic.Bucur, p. 287 The ICS also hosted an illegal cell of the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), which worked closely with the communist resistant Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu. This group and the Institute as a whole played a major part in the antifascist coup of August 1944. During the events, Golopen»õia and his men occupied the building housing Radio Bucharest, while ManuilƒÉ, from his home on Schitu MƒÉgureanu Boulevard, ensured communications between the PCdR and Maniu.Vasile Liveanu, \\"Rolul Partidului Comunist Rom√¢n √Æn pregƒÉtirea insurec»õiei na»õionale antifasciste armate (√Æn lumina izvoarelor publicate √Æntre anii 1944 ‚Äî 1947)\\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 8/1974, p. 17; Tudor CƒÉlin Zarojanu, Via»õa lui Corneliu Coposu. Editura Ma»ôina de Scris, Bucharest, 2005, , pp. 27‚Äì29, 31 Following the start of Soviet occupation, ManuilƒÉ joined the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS), for a while heading its Sociological Section. At the same time, with an article in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, he argued that America's victory in the war was a direct evidence of its superior health policies.Sabin ManuilƒÉ, \\"SƒÉnƒÉtatea na»õiunii √Æn Statele Unite\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 3/1945, pp. 654‚Äì655 ManuilƒÉ and FƒÉcƒÉoaru were publicly congratulated by the Jewish community for their role in rescuing their coreligionists. At the time, ManuilƒÉ was obfuscating his earlier participation in the passage of antisemitic regulations. In his December 1944 interview with the Jewish magazine Curierul Israelit, he asserted: \\"The adoption of racial laws constitutes a great aberration in the mind, is not congruent with this century, and is alien to the traditions of the Romanian nation.\\" ManuilƒÉ soon joined the Union of Patriots, a PCdR ally, and, in November, was appointed Undersecretary of State for Stately Organization, serving under Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu.Radu PƒÉiu»ôan, \\"Activitatea Uniunii Patrio»õilor √Æn Banat √Æn anul 1944\\", in Analele Banatului. Arheologie-Istorie, Vol. XVIII, 2010, p. 297 According to other sources, however, he was still (or also) a PN»ö representative. Under SƒÉnƒÉtescu, Romania joined the Allies, and fought in particular against the Hungarians in Northern Transylvania. ManuilƒÉ was co- opted on the advisory council of the Commissariat for Transylvania's Liberated Regions, created by his patron Maniu as a special branch of government. Alongside the goal of returning Romanian administrators to the area, the Commissariat also made a specific point of dissuading Hungarian irredentism.Mih√°ly Zolt√°n Nagy, G√°bor Vincze, Autonomi»ôti »ôi centrali»ôti. Enigmele unor decizii istorice. Transilvania de Nord din septembrie 1944 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn martie 1945. Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, Cluj-Napoca, 2008, , pp. 28‚Äì29, 30, 53, 110‚Äì117 ManuilƒÉ also campaigned internationally for the recognition of Romanian rule in Northern Transylvania, citing demographic and historical evidence in his English-language tract, The Vienna Award and Its Demographical Consequences (1945).Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 132‚Äì133 He was consumed with a project to set up the Western Faculty of Medicine in Timi»ôoara, with which he hoped to tackle the Banat depopulation issue. Communist takeover and defection ManuilƒÉ kept his government post after SƒÉnƒÉtescu fell and was replaced with Nicolae RƒÉdescu, but was forced out by the communist purge of the power structures, in March 1945. He returned to the ICS, but found himself in conflict with both the party cell and the corporate trade union. Having lost his job at ARLUS and his seat on the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, he was eventually demoted by the Institute in August 1947. His position was filled in by Golopen»õia, who, although a proteg√© of the communist Miron Constantinescu,Impey, pp. 280, 281 was seen by ManuilƒÉ as a worthy successor. ManuilƒÉ became a political suspect, but not because of his Nazi contacts; rather, ManuilƒÉ was perceived as an Americophile. With Georgescu-Roegen and the state carrier inspector Max Manolescu, ManuilƒÉ considered a plan to escape from Romania by plane, but this was thwarted by police during a routine checkup. According to Georgescu- Roegen, their plan also involved PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, who had fallen out with his communist partners.Georgescu-Roegen, pp. 24‚Äì26 Seizing his last opportunity just before the communist regime took over,Boia, p. 253 ManuilƒÉ appealed to the anti-communist resistance figure Silviu Craciunas, who ran a people- smuggling operation. Using this channel, and with assistance from three Jewish anticommunists (Lola Roth and the brothers Leibovici), ManuilƒÉ crossed the porous border into the Hungarian Republic. Marius Oprea, \\"O istorie cu spioni (IV)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 8, 2008 Sabin and Veturia ManuilƒÉ defected in Austria,Moldovanu, p. 161 and eventually made their way to the United States. In 1948, ManuilƒÉ settled in New York City, where he continued his scientific and publishing work. Additionally, he was involved in the exile community, taking part in its cultural and political activities. He worked with the Iuliu Maniu Foundation, the Assembly of Captive European Nations (ACEN), the National Committee for a Free Europe, and a virtual government-in- exile, the Romanian National Committee (RNC).Co»ôovanu, passim; Petraru, pp. 139‚Äì140 He also headed a section on the Study of Displaced Populations at the International Institute of Sociology, under Gini's presidency.Turda & Gillette, p. 247 Veturia ManuilƒÉ was also involved in such work, joining the National Council of Romanian Women in Exile and speaking on Radio Free Europe.Co»ôovanu, p. 7. See also Moldovanu, p. 161 In 1952, ManuilƒÉ became an RNC representative to the United Nations and, three years later, was sworn in as an executive member of the RNC.Petraru, pp. 152, 157 His brother Camil was also a member of the RNC staff by 1956, by which time the Committee's hope for an anticommunist takeover in Romania were evidently unrealistic.Alexandru Banto»ô, Jon Cepoi, \\"Am cƒÉutat sƒÉ mƒÉ identific cu »õara mea, indiferent de locul unde mƒÉ aflam...\\", in Retrospectiva necesarƒÉ. Dialoguri, Casa Limbii Rom√¢ne, Chi»ôinƒÉu, 2007, p. 62 In 1950, ManuilƒÉ debated over Romania's fate behind the Iron Curtain with George Sokolsky, the American broadcaster, who had noted that, as home to a fascist regime, Romania deserved its status. ManuilƒÉ retorted that: \\"for a period, [Romania] had a fascist government, it is true. But Romania has overthrown it with decision and firmness. Italy had, Germany had, Japan had fascist governments, which were never overthrown until conquered. Yet they are today recipients of American favors.\\" As noted by scholar Johanna Granville, this reply omitted to mention that the overthrow of fascism had in fact resulted in Northern Transylvania being returned to Romania.Granville, p. 42 Stranded in Romania and sacked from his position at the Institute, Golopen»õia drew up schemes for the decommunization in Romania, recording his thoughts and his intention to contact ManuilƒÉ. His notes were picked up by the Securitate during the PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu trial, and resulted in Golopen»õia's fatal imprisonment.Impey, pp. 282‚Äì284 Later life and legacy Professionally, ManuilƒÉ was employed by Stanford University Institute for Food Research, where he published a monograph on The Agricultural Economy of the Danubian Countries: 1935-1945, then as a Counselor for the United States Census Bureau.Co»ôovanu, p. 3. See also Granville, p. 73 Working at ACE and the Commission for Refugees Help, he dealt with issues of social security, population trends, and refugees' social integration.Petraru, pp. 139‚Äì140 During the 1950s, he also completed work on demographic histories of the Romanian Jews (Regional Development of the Jewish Population in Romania in 1957, Popula»õia EvreiascƒÉ din Rom√¢nia in 1958).Co»ôovanu, pp. 3, 6; Petraru, pp. 140, 191 These brought him close to Wilhelm Filderman, the exile Jewish Romanian political activist and RNC affiliate, who helped him obtain raw data. ManuilƒÉ presented his and Filderman's findings at the International Statistical Institute's 30th Congress, in Stockholm (1957).Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 134; Petraru, p. 140 However, according to Holocaust historian Jean Ancel, Filderman \\"knew nothing of ManuilƒÉ's 'other face'\\", and ManuilƒÉ profited from his \\"good faith\\" to grossly underestimate Romania's share in the genocide. Filderman's more realistic notes were never published by ManuilƒÉ, who mis- cited them as backing his own data; Filderman, Ancel notes, never had a chance to question the text, having fallen ill with Alzheimer's disease between their compiling and the Stockholm presentation. In September 1963, ManuilƒÉ attended the 20th International Congress of Sociology, in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where he presented a paper on wartime demographics in Romania, noting the increase of living standards in the 1960s.Philippe P√©rier, \\"Le XXe Congr√®s International de Sociologie √† Cordoba (Argentine)\\", in Les √âtudes Sociales, Issues 60‚Äì61, March‚ÄìJune 1964, p. 24 He died in New York City on November 20, 1964. His widow Veturia continued to publish memoirs and studies in social science. She died in Brick Township in 1986. Stripped of his Romanian Academy membership during the four decades of communist rule, ManuilƒÉ was posthumously readmitted in July 1990, that is to say six months after the Romanian Revolution. Access to his archive at the ICS was strictly prohibited under communism, and remained restricted after 1989.Achim (2005), pp. 143, 153 As critically noted by Bucur, his subsequent depictions in Romanian historiography are those of a \\"tolerant, rational, balanced\\" scientist, glossing over his wartime activities.Bucur, p. 333 Controversially, in the mid 1990s ManuilƒÉ's studies on minority populations were included in works of Holocaust revisionists Kurt Treptow and Larry Watts, alongside fabricated quotes from Filderman, in what was read as an effort to induce doubt about Antonescu's antisemitic crimes.Final Report, pp. 357‚Äì358. See also Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 134; Bucur, p. 333 ManuilƒÉ's claims and the related fabrications were reused in denialist claims stated by authors such as Gheorghe Buzatu and Raoul »òorban.Drago»ô Constantin Sdrobi»ô, \\"Considera»õii cu referire la na»õionalismul lui Raoul »òorban\\", in Studia Universitatis Cibiniensis.

Santa Anna's capture As a captain in Sidney Sherman's Kentucky Riflemen, he was the standard-bearer for the only flag flown during the battle. A printer's apprentice by trade, he had been born in 1807 in Baltimore, Maryland, before his parents relocated to Kentucky where he enlisted with Sherman to go to Texas and join the fight for independence. After the Kentucky Riflemen reached Gonzales on March 6, they joined with Sam Houston moving ahead of the Mexican army and training for the eventual engagement that ended with Santa Anna signing the Treaties of Velasco. Santa Anna's capture was accidental. When the battle broke out, Santa Anna deserted his men and fled on horseback. He was found by Sylvester at Vince's Bayou wearing a private's uniform and hiding in the grass. Sylvester had been hunting for food and was initially unaware the person he had just captured was the leader of the Mexican army. Later life Sylvester remained in Texas a few more years, but eventually moved to New Orleans to resume his chosen profession with The Picayune newspaper.

The church stands in the heart of Gr√§nna, dominating the town's skyline. It was built on the remnants of the original stone church dating back to the middle of the 12th century. The foundation of that church is still preserved under the floor of today's Gr√§nna Church. The original church was rebuilt and expanded in several stages over the centuries. For example, Count Per Brahe the Younger funded the cost of a new stone tower in 1673. Much of that church was destroyed in the 1889 fire. However, many furnishings were saved from the fire, including the altarpiece, a medieval communion cabinet and some light fixtures and artwork. Articles rescued from the fire are now on display inside Gr√§nna Church. The church has been designated a ‚Äúv√§gkyrka,‚Äù a roadside church open to travelers.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Harry Althrop (Dexter), a young American, is in love with Princess Cordelia (Cavalieri) and when he finds his funds are getting low he forges the signature of Thomas Lawton (Laffey), the American ambassador and a close friend of his father, to a check so that he might buy the beautiful Italian princess some jewelry. Count Rudolph Frizel (Hale) of Austria, anxious to obtain information concerning Italy's stand in an approaching war, threatens to expose Harry unless he provides the documents from the American embassy. It turns out that the specific documents are readily available with the ambassador, and Harry picks them up and gives them to the Count. This act is discovered by the ambassador and Harry is brought to trial. Cordelia learning of Harry's predicament, goes to Count Frizel and kills him to obtain the documents. The documents are then returned to the embassy, and Harry is released. Cordelia returns home, takes poison and dies in her lovers arms. The film ends with Cordelia on her bier.

The founder was Hugh J. Hastings, a young immigrant from County Fermanagh, Ireland, who worked as a reporter for several local newspapers before striking out on his own as a publisher/editor in the newspaper-rich community. He gave his newspaper its name in recognition of the region's deep Dutch heritage. (Albany began as the Dutch settlement of Beverwyck, then became Fort Orange after the British takeover, and eventually was renamed Albany after the English Duke of Albany.) Over the years, Hastings (who became politically influential before eventually selling his company and moving to Monmouth, New Jersey, where he worked as a publisher until his death in a carriage accident) and his successor owners purchased and absorbed numerous competitors, and for decades the publication had the highest daily circulation in New York's Capital Region. What came to be called The Knickerbocker News after it absorbed the competing Albany Evening News was sold to the Gannett Corp. in 1928. Then, in 1960, Gannett sold it to the Hearst Corporation, the same year in which Hearst sold one of its two Rochester, NY, newspapers to Gannett, in effect giving each communications giant a virtual monopoly in the two respective upstate cities. The evening newspaper's last editor was Harry M. Rosenfeld, who had been hired from the editorial staff of The Washington Post by the Hearst Corp. about a year earlier to be editor of that newspaper and its sister publication, the Albany Times Union. William M. Dowd, a veteran writer and editor who had been the associate managing editor of Hearst's Baltimore News American before moving to Albany in February 1977 to oversee The Knickerbocker News' daily operations and wrote an award-winning column that contributed to the publication winning more than 100 journalism awards in its final decade, was its last managing editor. When The Knickerbocker News staff and resources were folded into the Times Union, under corporate orders no layoffs were made, an unusual decision in an industry in which staffing reductions during mergers had become the norm to cut costs. According to The New York Times in 1988, in the paper's circulation \\"heyday in the 1930s and 1940s\\" it \\"was known for aggressive reporting, strong political coverage and a readable style.\\" It continued to be known for those characteristics as shown by its annual harvest of journalism awards until its final days of publication. The Knickerbocker News' circulation peaked at about 71,000 in 1972-73, which made it the largest newspaper at that time in the Capital Region, but had fallen to about 28,000 by the late 1980s. That was a fate that overtook most afternoon newspapers in the United States as major changes in the manufacturing sector resulted in changes in readership cycles by people who had been mainstays of newspaper purchasing before they began working different shifts and sought morning publications.

History The Queensland Department of Housing purchased the Gona Barracks site in 2000 looking for opportunities to develop affordable housing either on the site or funded from the redevelopment of the site. Queensland University of Technology operated its Kelvin Grove campus (formerly the campus of the Brisbane College of Advanced Education and other predecessor institutions) on an adjacent site and desired to expand their campus. Brisbane City Council which controlled adjacent parkland wanted to develop a Local Area Plan that would maximise opportunities for such a large site so close to the Brisbane CBD. Difficulties associated with any redevelopment included the heritage values of the Gona Barracks site (it was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2005), steep slopes and contaminated land. A heritage assessment of the Gona Barracks site determined that it was the buildings of the upper barracks around the parade ground that, as a group, were of a greatest significance rather than individual buildings. A partnership between the Queensland Department of Housing, Brisbane City Council and the Queensland University of Technology was formed to develop a mixed-use urban village precinct using the Gona Barracks site and adjacent land. The university built its Creative Industries precinct re-using Gona Barracks buildings and introducing new buildings, sited to reinforce the rectangular form of the Gona barracks parade ground. The re-development won major planning and design awards from the Urban Development Institute of Australia. Following $23,000,000 on construction of infrastructure, the Kelvin Grove Urban Village was officially opened by Queensland Premier Peter Beattie on Monday 24 November 2003. Facilities Unlike most Australian university campuses that comprise a large site for the sole use of the university, the Kelvin Grove Urban Village contains a mix of university buildings (some purpose-built by the university and other buildings leased by the university), apartment blocks, and retail shops.

The three-aisled hall church, which holds 1,200 people, has an tower in the south- western part of the building. Oscar's Church is located in the south-eastern part of √ñstermalm, where Storgatan and Narvav√§gen meet, near the Swedish History Museum. Narvav√§gen is together with the nearby Strandv√§gen‚Äîfrom which the church is also visible‚Äîone of the city's main boulevards, lined with several residential palaces. History The church was inaugurated in September 1903 as the result of a design competition nine years earlier. The competition was won by Gustaf Hermansson, who also designed the Sofia Church. It was King Oscar II himself, after whom the church is named, who laid the foundation stone in 1897. Criticised from the start for its Gothic Revival style, it was originally meant to be partly clad in brick; this changed to a uniformly white fa√ßade, clad in limestone and marble. The construction work was delayed several times because of problems with the foundation, non- deliveries and labour strikes, which is why the church was not consecrated until 1903. Interior Stained glass windows The church underwent several renovations during the 1900s. In 1921‚Äì1923 major changes were made to the interior, including new stained glass windows designed by Emanuel Vigeland, all under the direction of architect Lars Israel Wahlman, previously known for having designed the Engelbrekt Church. In 1954‚Äì1956 further alterations were made to the interior, leading to changes in the altarpiece and the removal of some ornamental ceiling decorations. Organ The main church organ, considered to be one of the country's most notable, has received attention abroad. It was built in 1949 by the Danish firm Marcussen & S√∏n, to the wishes of Alf Linder, who was the church organist from 1943 until his death in 1983. The organ has four manuals and a pedal, with a total of 78 voices and more than 5,200 pipes ‚Äî making it one of the largest in Sweden.

Solid waste Municipal solid waste Thais per capita generate an estimated 1.14 kg of solid waste per day‚Äî50 percent of it biodegradable. According to Interior Ministry statistics, refuse nationwide in 2016 amounted to 27 million tonnes, up about 0.7 percent from the previous year. Of this, 4.2 million tonnes was generated in Bangkok. The yearly figure in 2009 was 15.1 million tonnes. About twenty percent of total is generated in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA) Of the waste generated in 2015, only about five million tonnes were recycled. Only about eight million tonnes were handled in accordance with global best practices. Of Thailand's 2,500 dump sites, only about 20 percent are managed properly. According to the Pollution Control Department (PCD), Thailand's primary waste watchdog, the nation faces serious solid waste management issues. Those issues are increasing. Wichan Simachaya, director-general of the PCD, said the volume of waste could continue to grow by 600,000 tonnes a year, due to increasing population and tourism. Thailand's waste management plan calls for 75 percent of Thailand's total solid waste to be properly disposed of or recycled in some way by 2021, up from the current 49 percent. By 2021, the government and private sector plan to spend a total of 177 billion baht (US$5.1 billion) on waste management technology and public awareness campaigns. \\"We have fines for littering but no one seems to care,\\" Wijarn said. \\"We need to step up law enforcement as well as teach people to recycle, reuse and reduce waste.\\" In Thailand the roles in solid waste management (MSW) and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided among the central government, regional governments, and local governments. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible to stimulate regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating central and local governments. Local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. Local governments themselves do not dispose of waste, but instead hire private companies that have been granted that right by the PCD. A major problem is lack of funding for waste management‚Äîthe average Thai household pays less than one dollar a month to dispose of its solid waste. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO); SGS Thailand; Waste Management Siam Ltd (WMS); Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). and Professional Waste Technology (1999) Public Company Ltd A leading resource recovery company is Wongpanit, who purchase mixed recyclables (paper, plastics, glass, aluminum, steel) at about 11,300 baht per tonne. These companies are responsible for the waste they have picked up from their customers before disposal. Organic waste The PCD estimates that in 2017 organic waste collected by municipalities across Thailand accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country's total waste output: a reported 7.6 million tonnes‚Äî 64%‚Äîof the refuse collected was organic waste. It is thought that a significant portion of this waste is not merely fruit and vegetable peelings, but edible surplus food. This in a nation where 400,000 to 600,000 children may be undernourished due to poverty, yet ten percent of all children are obese. Prevailing attitudes do not encompass composting or waste sorting: 64 percent of the Thai population do not sort their rubbish according to one study. Plastic waste Thailand is a profligate user of one-time use plastics. Thais use 70 billion plastic bags a year. The country is a major contributor, along with China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, of up to 60% of plastic pollution in oceans. Thailand's 23 coastal provinces dump an estimated one million tonnes of garbage into the sea each year. Plastic bags make up 15%, plastic straws account for seven percent, and cigarette butts five percent. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 150 sea turtles, 100 whales and dolphins, and 12 dugongs die each year from discarded trash, half of which die from eating plastic bags. In June 2017, Thailand pledged at an international forum to reduce plastic use. Thailand admitted waste mismanagement was the major cause of Thailand's poor record. Delegates representing Thailand's military government at the conference committed to put an end to the problem. Accordingly, it has included waste management in its 20-year national strategy. In an easy step forward, Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) got agreements from five major water bottlers to cease using plastic cap seals on drinking water bottles by 1 April 2018. A cap seal is the small plastic wrap molded over the bottle cap that must be peeled off before the bottle can be opened. Studies have found that bottles without them pose no hygienic health risk. The PCD aims to have them removed from all bottled water containers by the end of 2018. According to the PCD, Thailand produces 4.4 billion plastic drinking water bottles per year. Sixty percent, or 2.6 billion, of these bottles have cap seals. The weight of the plastic cap seals alone is around 520 tonnes per year. On 21 July 2018 the Thai government kicked off a campaign to reduce the use of foam containers and single-use plastic bags at fresh markets countrywide. Early indications are that those efforts have not been embraced by the Thai public. Finally, a ban on single-use plastic bags with a thickness of less than 36 microns at major retailers was enacted to take effect on 1 January 2020. The ban exempts, until 2021, the 40% of total volume of single- use bags used at wet markets and restaurants. Bag manufacturers have cried foul, arguing that the solution to plastic pollution is proper disposal of bags and recycling. To make matters worse for the manufacturers, eight TV channels signed an agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 2 January 2020 to blur images and footage of single-use plastic bags on-screen, as is done in Thailand for firearms, cigarettes, and alcohol. Thailand imported 480,000 tonnes of plastic garbage from abroad in 2018, and is set to import an additional 220,000 tonnes before existing contracts expire in September 2020. Between 2014 and 2018 Thailand imported 906,521 tonnes of plastic from 81 countries, according to the Commerce Ministry. Plastic imports nearly doubled between 2018 and 2019 due to increased Chinese imports. Industrial and toxic waste Thailand collected and processed the industrial waste of 68,261 companies. Its capacity to process industrial and toxic waste is 37.6 million tonnes annually, an estimated 2.8 million tonnes of which is toxic waste. Total capacity in 2015 was 25.8 million tonnes. The Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Works (DIW) plans to establish 15 regional waste management facilities throughout the country as detailed in its five-year waste management plan for 2015-2019. Medical waste The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's 500-bed General Hospital produces about 196,000 pieces of \\"medical waste\\" per month. About half of this waste consists of \\"clean products\\": packaging, PVC bags for dialysis solution, and other non- infectious items that could potentially be recycled or upcycled. Thailand has thirty-three 500-or more-bed hospitals, as well as 321 other hospitals and health centres with between 11 and 250 bed nationwide, meaning the quantity of medical waste is significant. Electronic waste Thailand banned the import of foreign electronic waste (e-waste) in June 2019, the same year as China. In spite of the ban, new recycling factories have opened across Thailand, particularly in the eastern provinces, and tonnes of potentially hazardous e-waste are being processed. Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most processing e-waste, started up in Chachoengsao Province alone. In 2019, 14 businesses in that province were granted licenses to process e-waste. In October 2019, the Thai legislature relaxed labour and environmental regulations for all factories, a boon to the e-waste industry. One provision of the legislation even exempts small companies from pollution monitoring. Concomitantly, a bill to strengthen e-waste restrictions has gone nowhere in parliament. An official of the Basel Action Network, which campaigns against dumping waste in poor countries, said, \\"E-waste has to go somewhere, and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to Southeast Asia. The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labour and pollute the hell out of the environment,\\" he added. Waste water In a 2004 study commissioned by the World Bank to examine the state of Thailand's infrastructure, the authors concluded that, \\"The worst infrastructure provision performance in Thailand is in waste water treatment....Virtually none of the...[waste water treatment] systems are operating....only 3 waste water plants operate sporadically. The problem is that no user fees are assessed or collected and that households and firm [sic] are not required to connect to the systems. Water supply authorities,...have consistently refused to add waste water charges to their water supply bills, despite clear evidence from international experience that this is best practice.\\" At the end of 2016, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is considering the imposition of a waste water fee, pending endorsement by the BMA council. If approved, the move will impose fees on waste water release: * Households producing waste water of 10‚Äì100 m3 per month will be charged 30 baht * State agencies, schools, companies, hospitals producting less than 500 m3 will be charged 500 baht * Discharging between 500-1,000 m3 will incur a 1,000 baht charge * Discharge exceeding 1,000 m3 will be charged 1,500 baht * Factories, hotels, and other large-scale users will pay four baht per cubic metre The fees collected will be used to improve waste water facilities operated by the BMA. In 2015 Thailand produced 9.5 million m3 of waste water. This was the equivalent of 150 litres per day per person. Only 34 percent of the waste water was treated at one of Thailand's 93 treatment facilities before being returned to the environment. One direct result was a corresponding deterioration of the quality of Thai coastal waters. Environmental impacts According to the United Nations Ocean Conference Thailand produces about 50.000 tonnes of solid waste that finds its way into the sea each year.https://oceanconference.un.org/commitments/?id=18208 Large quantities of coastal rubbish, especially in the upper reaches of the Gulf of Thailand impact sea life and coastal mangroves. Mangrove swamps are cluttered with garbage. At one site, the Bangkok Post reported that, \\"Plastic bags, bottles, ropes, discarded noodle containers and even a rusty cooking appliance float in the water or are stuck in the mud under the green canopy.\\" The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower Chao Phraya River, which flows through Bangkok, contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from phosphates, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD categorised water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District as \\"very poor\\" and worse than in 2014. Nearby rivers, such as the Tha Chin in Samut Sakhon, were rated \\"poor\\". PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.

Plot Many years ago the humans discovered space travel and decided to explore the galaxy. A small group calling themselves \\"The Confederation\\" discovered an ancient planet with unlimited resources which helped them develop their technical potential. It took them some time, but finally they‚Äôve managed to create an AI so profound that it developed a free will. They‚Äôve called these creatures \\"Terteths\\". With time passing these robots were assisting the Confederation in everything. Realizing their own potential the Terteths formed a Union and separate themselves from the Confederation. Few of them stayed as assistants to their masters but the others were curious about the rest of the universe, just like their creators. In their distant journeys the Terteths discovered another intelligent race at the far end of their Galaxy, Insect-like creatures they called \\"Noxis\\". Blinded by their eagerness for knowledge, the Terteths and the Confederation didn‚Äôt notice that the Noxis had started to evolve. Like many other creatures the Noxis were parasites, linking with an unsuspected source they would drain information and eventually overtake their host. War has started. The three races were in constant conflict. The end wasn‚Äôt near and some outcasts, less hostile communities separated from their people. They formed alliances and combined their knowledge in a final effort to escape. You can help the outcasts in their quest.

There are 7 types of warships, 5 civilian and one service ship. There are also 7 types of defense units which can be used to defend your planets if your ships are on a mission. Even if you are not a fan of the war units you can choose to construct one or two planet shields which could defend your planets from some of the weaker ships and prevent raids. Science There are 22 different sciences that are in greater assistance to the player in certain moments of his development. Because of the great distances between the different planets, the player can increase his ship's speed up to 750% which makes it faster reaching the desired location. There are sciences that can increase resource and energy income, provide additional attack or health to the players' units or unlock hidden secrets and plans for developing the master units. Alliances and Team Planets Each player can join existing alliances or create his own alliance and with the assistance of eight of his friends from the other races, he can create a powerful Team Planet. From these Team planets all alliance members can launch an attack toward a Sun and try to obtain a Crystal.

The two countries never maintained an embassy in their respective capitals since the suspension of diplomatic relations in February 2014. History The two countries established diplomatic ties on 27 November 1974, during the Cold War. Botswana's first independent leader, President Seretse Khama, made a state visit to Pyongyang between 9 and 13 August 1976. During the visit, he and his wife met with Kim Il-sung, who arranged a banquet for them. Reportedly, Khama startled his hosts by playing billiards, at one point stretching across the pool table in a rather awkward position. In the early 1980s, several North Korean martial arts instructors were commissioned to train the Botswana Police Service in unarmed combat. The North Koreans left Botswana shortly after they arrived, apparently due to inciting the constables against their superiors, and trying to convince them to seek a more democratic form of police work. In modern times, North Korean constructors from the Mansudae Overseas Projects state company have built the Three Dikgosi Monument, located in Gaborone, depicting three tribal chiefs. The monument, inaugurated by President Festus Mogae in September 2005, has been the source of controversy. Botswana has also attempted to hire North Korean medical professionals to supplement their own. In 2013, the Botswana government suspended bilateral cooperation with the DPRK due to concerns with the human rights situation in North Korea. On 20 February 2014 it subsequently continued this path, by fully terminating all diplomatic and consular relations with North Korea following a report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, making Botswana the first African country to recognize, de jure, the Republic of Korea as the sole legitimate government of Korea.

It has been scheduled as an ancient monument and is a Grade II* listed building. The retractable bridge was built in 1871 to the design of Sir Francis Fox, the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a railway siding over the river to the coal yard and docks in the Port of Bridgwater, but had to be movable, to allow boats to proceed upriver to the Town Bridge. Part of the railway siding followed the route previously used by a horse-drawn tram which had later been converted to a mixed gauge rail system. An section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways by a traverser, making space so that the main girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was wide. It was manually operated for the first eight months, and then powered by a steam engine, reverting to manual operation in 1913, when the steam engine failed. The Bristol and Exeter Railway, including the branch line and bridge, was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1876. The bridge was temporarily immobilised during World War II and last opened in 1953, and the traverser section was demolished in 1974, but public outcry at the action resulted in the bridge being listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the rest of the bridge was kept. It was later used as a road crossing, until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it, and is now only used by pedestrians. Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977, and other parts of the bridge mechanism to Didcot Railway Centre.

It was founded in 1924 by Japanese immigrants and thrived for the next five years. The SCC was the only Japanese American photography club to include both Caucasians and women photographers as members, and because of their inclusivity their members were among the most exhibited photographers in the world at that time. History The 39 charter members of the club were all Japanese men. Unlike other prominent clubs of Japanese photographers, they decided at the beginning to welcome women and Caucasian members. The driving force behind the club's formation was Dr. Kyo Koike, who was a well‚Äírespected medical doctor in Seattle's Issei community. They held monthly meetings at 508¬Ω Main Street near Dr. Koike's office. At these meetings members critiqued each other's prints and discussed current ideas about photography. Dr. Koike wrote about these discussions in their monthly bulletin, as well as descriptions of photography trips the members had taken, names of those members who had exhibited recently, and commentaries about photography in general. The club's bulletin was called Notan, which is a Japanese term that roughly translates as ‚Äúlight and shade‚Äù. These were qualities that defined the primary elements of a Japanese style of pictorialism that most of the original members prized. Many of their photographs contained strong lighting and rhythmical patterns that emphasized the artistic quality of a scene. In 1925 the club began its own salon, which originally featured photographs by its own members but later expanded to an international field of photographers. The artistic strength of their membership is indicated by the fact that in 1926 members of the club showed a collective 589 prints in different exhibitions around the world. That same year Photo‚ÄíEra magazine offered a trophy for the photography club whose members won the most awards in the magazine's competitions. The first winner of the trophy was the Seattle Camera Club. The club reached its peak membership in 1925 with 85 members, including several photographers who in lived in other areas of the country. Two prominent Seattle women, Ella McBride and Virna Haffer, were among the club's members by that time. Only one‚Äíquarter of the members then were Japanese Americans. Soon thereafter the membership in the club began to decline, primarily due to increasing economic difficulties that led up to the 1929 Great Depression. Many members held low-paying jobs, and with increased prices and a scarcity of jobs they could no longer afford to buy film or other photographic supplies. On October 11, 1929 the club held a farewell meeting. Only 7 members attended, and they formally disbanded the club at that time. Some of the more well-to-do members, like Koike and Matsushita, continued to make photographs and exhibit them when they could. All of their efforts ended with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. Soon thereafter almost all of the Japanese American community in Seattle was transported to the Japanese American internment camps in Idaho or Montana. Partial list of members *Wayne Albee (1882-1937) Thought to have been an honorary member in an advisory capacity. *Virna Haffer (1899-1974) A photographer, printmaker, painter, musician, and published author. *Kyo Koike (1878-1947) - The originator of the club, he was a successful medical doctor who had a thriving practice in the Japanese community in Seattle. He underwrote many of the expenses of forming the club, and was editor of the club's newsletter Notan. He left all of his photographs and extensive records of the club to fellow member Iwao Matsushita. *Frank Kunishige (1878‚Äí1960) A founding member of SCC and one of only a few club members who had formal training in photography. In 1911 he attended photography school in Illinois, and after moving to Seattle he worked in the darkrooms of Edward Curtis and Ella McBride. Because of his training and experience he was one of the technical experts of the club. He created and sold his own photographic paper, Textura Tissue, which was a favorite of club members because it emphasized the soft qualities that Pictorial photographers prized. *Kusutora Matsuki (1879-?) Matsuki, who favored small cameras, had noted pictures that appeared in Notan, Photo-Era and The New York Times. *Iwao Matsushita (1892-1979) Matsushita helped preserve the Seattle Camera Club's legacy through his friendship with the head of the University of Washington Libraries Special Collections, Robert Monroe. Monroe acquired photos, archives and 8-mm films from Matsushita, the latter of which continue to be viewable in the lobby of the Henry. *Ella E. McBride (1862-1965) A pioneering female fine- art photographer, she was a business partner to Albee, and an early mentor to Kunishige and Sunami. Although she had previously worked extensively on the business end of photography, she was already in her late 50s by the time she joined the club as a practicing artist. She lived to be over 100, and enjoyed a long and successful art career late in life. *Yukio Morinaga (1888‚Äì1968) One of the more tragic stories of the SCC, Morinaga was embittered by his internment during the war, refused to pay taxes after his release, and eventually starved himself to death at age 80. *Riichi Morita (1891‚Äì1975) The sixth-most exhibited member of the club in its early years, Morita was also a poet, who, later in life, published a book of poems together with his wife. *Hideo Onishi (1890‚Äí ca. 1934) Employed as a restaurant cook, he was a prolific and very successful photographer. In 1926 he was the club's top exhibitor for the year, and that same year more than 1,000 people attended an exhibition of his photographs at the Japanese Commercial Club in Seattle. He sold 233 copies of his prints at that exhibition and gave the profits to SCC. *Soichi Sunami (1885‚Äí1971) He learned photography in Seattle while working as an assistant at the studio of Ella McBride. In 1922 he moved to New York to study at Art Students League, where there he photographed student dancers and artists. He also continued showing his photographs at SCC and was one of the most active non‚Äíresident members of the club. Later he became of the main photographers for the Museum of Modern Art and continued to work there for 38 years.

It is Australia's only purpose-built theatre in the round. The building is owned by Queensland University of Technology and used by the La Boite Theatre Company. History The La Boite Theatre Building was Australia's first purpose-built theatre-in- the-round, constructed for the Brisbane Repertory Theatre which then renamed itself La Boite Theatre Company. The La Boite Theatre Building could seat 200 at its fullest configuration. The La Boite Theatre Building was deemed to be of such significant cultural and architectural significance that it was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2004. However, it struggled to be commercially viable and was eventually redeveloped as commercial offices. In 1998 the Australian Army decided it no longer required its heritage-listed Gona Barracks and wished to sell the land. This led to a partnership being formed between the Queensland Department of Housing, the Brisbane City Council and the Queensland University of Technology to redevelop the site as the Kelvin Grove Urban Village as a mixed use precinct combining educational, residential and retail use of the site. The urban village had a strong arts and entertainment theme as the university was placing its Creative Industries Faculty in the village. This was complemented by the Queensland Academy for Creative Industries, a selective public senior high school for students wishing to specialise in the arts and entertainment. The university constructed the Roundhouse Theatre in 2004 to meet its needs for a theatre for training students in the performing arts, but wanted the theatre to be used commercially as well to generate income and to be consistent with the philosophy of the urban village of integrating the university with the community. By constructing the university's theatre as a theatre-in-the-round, it enabled the La Boite Theatre Company to sell the La Boite Theatre Building and lease the Roundhouse Theatre instead, a commercially viable arrangement for both the theatre company and the university. Facilities The Roundhouse Theatre can seat 400 people for central staging (audience on four sides) or 336 people for thrust stage (audience on three sides). The La Boite Theatre Company (Queensland's 2nd largest theatre company) perform at the Roundhouse Theatre.

After earning a degree from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, he worked at his father's hardware company. Later, he co-founded an agricultural implement company. In 1883, he married Lily Buckner, with whom he fathered four children. Following the death of his father, Belknap became vice-president of his hardware company, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Lily Buckner Belknap died in 1893, and he married Marion S. Dumont in 1900. In addition to his business career. Belknap served in the Kentucky State Guard, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he served briefly in Puerto Rico prior to the end of hostilities. He was promoted to colonel before his honorable discharge in 1899. In 1903, Belknap accepted the nomination for state governor after being chosen at the Kentucky Republican convention in that year. He campaigned on his business experience and opposition to policies of the current governor, but he was ultimately defeated by the incumbent J. C. W. Beckham. After his unsuccessful gubernatorial run, he spent his later life involved in a variety of civil and religious organizations. On April 13, 1910, he died of pernicious anemia, a condition which is believed to have been worsened by a mysterious ailment he contracted while in Puerto Rico. Early life and family Belknap was born at his parents' home in Louisville, Kentucky, on June 7, 1856. He was the youngest child of William Burke and Mary (Richardson) Belknap. Until the age of 17, he was educated in the private school of Benjamin B. Huntoon. In 1873 he and his brother, William Richardson Belknap (1849‚Äì1914), spent a year traveling in Europe. On his return, he enrolled in the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, He earned his degree in 1877, but spent an additional year of postgraduate study in chemistry. Returning to Louisville in 1879, Belknap worked for his father's hardware company, W. B. Belknap and Company, for a short time before partnering with Thomas Miekle and Barry Coleman to form Thomas Miekle and Company, an agricultural implement manufacturer. He returned to Belknap and Company in 1883 as a secretary. On June 14, 1883, Belknap married Lily Buckner, the daughter of Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner. The couple had four children ‚Äì Gertrude, Walter Kingsbury, Lily, and Morris, Jr. Lily Belknap died in 1893. After her death, Belknap constructed a stone bridge ‚Äì dubbed Belknap Bridge ‚Äì in Louisville's Cherokee Park in her honor.Johnson, E. Polk (1912).

Matlack Collection Belknap's father died in 1889, and after incorporating his company as Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company, Morris Belknap became the company's vice-president, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He was the youngest person elected president of the Louisville Board of Trade, and he held that position for many years. Military service In 1879, Belknap enlisted as a private in the First Infantry Regiment of the Kentucky State Guard, known as the Louisville Legion. His father-in-law was elected Governor of Kentucky in 1887 and appointed Belknap to his military staff with the rank of colonel. In 1890, he was elected captain of Company A of the First Regiment in the Kentucky State Guard, and in 1893, he was chosen as the unit's lieutenant colonel. At the commencement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Governor William O'Connell Bradley called up Belknap's unit for service. He was mustered into federal service on May 13, 1898, and departed the same day, spending several weeks at Lexington, Kentucky, before arriving at Newport News, Virginia, on July 28, 1898. On August 1, General Frederick Dent Grant ordered six companies under Belknap to board the USRC Hudson bound for Puerto Rico. Arriving at Ponce on August 11, the men were forwarded to Mayag√ºez, and were ordered to follow the 11th Infantry Regiment inland as soon as transport could be secured. After hostilities had ceased. Belknap and his men remained at Mayag√ºez until August 26, then returned to Ponce, reuniting with the regiment on August 29 and 30. Upon Castleman's elevation to brigadier general, Belknap was promoted to colonel and given command of the First Kentucky. The unit returned to Louisville on December 12, 1898; Belknap was honorably discharged on February 24, 1899. Belknap saw no active service, h. On July 16, 1900, Belknap married Marion S. Dumont of Plainfield, New Jersey. Campaign for governor At the 1903 Republican state convention, party leaders including W. Godfrey Hunter supported Belknap as the party's gubernatorial nominee. Former governor Bradley, however, supported a fellow Louisvillian, attorney Augustus E. Willson. When a pro-Willson delegation was unseated by a challenge, Willson withdrew and Bradley bolted the convention. Consequently, Belknap was chosen as the party's nominee on the first ballot. Former Democratic governor Buckner supported his son-in-law's candidacy. Belknap touted his business management experience, contrasting it with charges that his opponent, incumbent Governor J. C. W. Beckham, had mismanaged the state's eleemosynary institutions. Belknap lacked name recognition outside Louisville. He was a poor public speaker, and he was unable to make the race truly competitive. The New York Times reported, \\"Col. Morris B. Belknap, the Republican nominee for Governor of Kentucky, is an athlete as well as a politician and a millionaire businessman. Election day was a rowdy one throughout the state, and a judge supporting Belknap was shot by a sheriff at a polling place in Louisville. Victory went to Belknap's opponent; Beckham won the election 229,014 to 202,764, marking the first time in sixteen years that the Democrats had gained a majority of the votes cast. Later life Belknap continued to be active in business, attending the International Congress of Chambers of Commerce in Li√®ge in 1905. From 1907 to 1909, he was chairman of the Louisville Board of Parks. He was a member of several civic and religious organizations, including the Pendennis Club, the Louisville Country Club, the Salmagundi Club of Louisville, and the Warren Memorial Presbyterian Church of Louisville, where he was a deacon and chairman of the board of trustees. He was president of the Yale Alumni Association in Louisville and director of that city's YMCA.Midlands, Louisville Belknap fell ill in late 1907, and his poor health continued into mid-1908. In July 1908, he traveled to Europe in order to improve his health, but after his return in October, his condition worsened again. From January to June 1909, he was bedfast. In early April 1910, he fell into a coma from which he never awakened. He died of pernicious anemia on April 13, 1910, at Lexington, Kentucky and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.

He is the Jacobus van 't Hoff Distinguished Professor of Molecular Sciences, at the Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen, Netherlands, and an Academy Professor and Chair of Board of the Science Division of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, together with Sir J. Fraser Stoddart and Jean-Pierre Sauvage, \\"for the design and synthesis of molecular machines\\".  Personal life  Feringa was born as the son of farmer Geert Feringa (1918‚Äì1993) and his wife Lies Feringa n√©e Hake (1924‚Äì2013). Feringa was the second of ten siblings in a Catholic family. He spent his youth on the family's farm, which is directly on the border with Germany, in Barger-Compascuum in the Bourtange moor. He is of Dutch and German descent. Among his ancestors is the settler Johann Gerhard Bekel. Together with his wife Betty Feringa, he has three daughters. He lives in Paterswolde near Groningen.See German and Dutch Wikipedia.  Career  Feringa received his MSc degree with distinction from the University of Groningen in 1974. He subsequently obtained a PhD degree at the same university in 1978, with the thesis titled \\"Asymmetric oxidation of phenols. Atropisomerism and optical activity\\". Following a short period at Shell in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, he was appointed as lecturer at the University of Groningen in 1984 and Full Professor, succeeding Prof Wijnberg, in 1988. His early career was focused on homogenous catalysis and oxidation catalysis, and especially on stereochemistry with major contributions in the field of enantioselective catalysis, including monophos ligand used in asymmetric hydrogenation, asymmetric conjugate additions of organometallic reagents, including the highly reactive organolithium reagents and organic photochemistry and stereochemistry. In the 1990s, Feringa's work in stereochemistry led to major contributions in photochemistry, resulting in the first monodirectional light driven molecular rotary motor and later a molecular car (a so-called nanocar) driven by electrical impulses. Ben Feringa holds over 30 patents and has published over 650 peer reviewed research papers to date, cited more than 30,000 times and has an h-index in excess of 90. He has guided over 100 PhD students over his career.  Contributions to research  The early introduction of chiroptical molecular switches,B.L.Feringa, W.F. Jager, B.de Lange, E.W. Meijer, Chiroptical Molecular Switch, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 5468-5470 based on the design of the first chiral overcrowded alkenes B.L.Feringa, H.

Feringa, Dynamic control and amplification of chirality, Science 1996, 273, 1686 lead to molecular rotary motors in which chirality plays a critical role in achieving the same function achieved by nature, for example, the unidirectional rotation of retinal in rhodopsin. This work led to the discovery of the world's first unidirectional molecular rotary motor and this work has been laying the ground-work for a key component of future molecular nanotechnology i.e. nanomachines and nanorobots powered by molecular motors. Feringa's design and synthesis of nanomolecular machines, specifically molecular switches and molecular motors, have initiated major novel approaches towards complex and dynamic chemical systems and the dynamic control of function. Applications of molecular switches developed in his group include responsive materials and surfaces, liquid crystals, electrochromic devices for optoelectronics, photo-switchable DNA as a molecular memory stick, responsive gels, polymers, and light-switchable protein channels for nanoscale drug delivery systems, anion sensing, responsive catalysts and photopharmacology as well as entirely novel approaches using responsive drugs toward anticancer agents, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic resistance, and biofilm formation. Interfacing molecular motors with the macroscopic world by surface assembly on gold nanoparticles and a macroscopic gold film, has shown that the motor functions while chemically bound to a surface, a key result for future nanomachines such as a molecular conveyor belt. Experiments that involve doping liquid crystals with molecular motors demonstrate that the motion of the motor can be harnessed to make macroscopic objects rotate on a liquid crystal film and drive molecular systems out-of-equilibrium. Several of these discoveries were selected for the list of most important chemical discoveries of the year by Chemical & Engineering News. In 2011, molecular ‚Äònanocar‚Äô, a molecule that contains molecular motor-based wheels and was shown to move on a solid surface upon subjection to electric current from an STM tip, was highlighted in international daily newspapers & magazines worldwide and selected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as one of the 10 major discoveries in sciences worldwide. Towards the future discipline of Systems chemistry, the development of a multistage chiral catalysts which comprises an integrated supramolecular system that brings together molecular recognition, chirality transfer, catalysis, stereoelectronic control and enantio-selectivity while all these processes can be enabled or disabled via an internal motor function, moves the design and application of molecular motors to a whole new level of sophistication. Aside from molecular motors and switches, Feringa's work has crossed many disciplines and includes the use of chiral electromagnetic radiation to generate enantioselectivity, low molecular weight gelators, imaging porphyrins with STM, drying induced self-assembly, organic synthesis, CD spectroscopy, asymmetric catalysis, exploring the origins of chirality including the possibility of an extraterrestrial source and various aspects of surface science including surface modification, surface energy control and porphyrin allayers.

It was the first feature-length film adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. The story follows the life of the title character (played by William Jossey), who kills his cousin (Francis McDonald) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (Gypsy Abbott). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit Bertram Bracken, while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards's directorial debut. Some reviewers praised the scenery and overall production quality, considering the film an improvement over staged adaptations of the novel. Others found the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records. The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, Beulah, was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, St. Elmo is now believed lost. Plot St. Elmo Murray and Murray Hammond, his cousin and best friend, are both in love with a young woman named Agnes Hunt. Although Agnes loves Murray, she rejects him for being too poor. Instead, she accepts the wealthy St. Elmo's marriage proposal. St. Elmo's mother holds a ball to celebrate the engagement. After the betrothal is publicly announced, Murray and Agnes meet covertly in the gardens. St. Elmo discovers their affair, challenges Murray to a duel, and kills his cousin with the first shot. The Devil possesses St. Elmo, and he becomes a cruel wanderer, spreading misery and misfortune where he travels. Twenty years later, the ingenue Edna Earle is traveling by train, hoping to find employment in a cotton mill after the death of her father, the village blacksmith. The train derails, and St. Elmo saves her from the burning wreckage. This act sets St. Elmo on the path to salvation as he and Edna slowly fall in love. Initially planning to depart for distant lands, a vision of Christ leads him to aid the impoverished. Freed from the Devil, he becomes a minister and marries Edna. Cast Production alt=A man kneels over a dead body as a crowd watches. Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 domestic novel St. Elmo was one of the best-selling novels of the 19th century, surpassed at the time only by Uncle Tom's Cabin, and later by Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. With the novel's success came broad cultural impact. Various consumer products, hotels, steamboats, railway carriages, and even several towns were named after the book, and many families named children after its characters. Although there was considerable interest in a theatrical adaptation, Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909. Other stage versions, many of which were financially successful, were quickly developed after her death later that year. The first film versions of the story followed shortly. In 1910, the Thanhouser Company chose St. Elmo for its second production, and Vitagraph Studios produced its own adaptation the same year. Both were one-reel short films. In 1914, while working for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the screenplay for the first feature-length film adaptation. Filming took place in Long Beach, California, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage of an actual church under construction across the street from the studio was used for a scene in which one was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film. Balboa highlighted the film's production value and artistry in its marketing; its film poster advertises \\"194 gorgeous scenes\\". However, Balboa was not a film distributor, so in May 1914 they contracted with William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company to have Fox handle the distribution of all Balboa films, beginning with St. Elmo. Copies of these films were then shown at Fox's theaters or rented out to other theater franchise owners, in what was known as the states' rights distribution system. On 1 February 1915, William Fox incorporated Fox Film, which inherited Box Office's assets. The new company continued to distribute some Box Office films, including St. Elmo, which played in some areas into 1916. Reception and legacy alt=A man, next to a corpse in a standing coffin, drinks with another man who represents the Devil. Contemporary reviews were mixed. Writing for Motion Picture News, A. Danson Michell found the film superior to stage adaptations of the novel, and especially praised the photography. Moving Picture World Hanford Judson also gave a generally positive review, believing that its production qualities and popular appeal more than compensated for the \\"artificiality\\" of a few scenes. Not all critics praised the film. Vanderheyden Fyles of Movie Pictorial felt the Long Beach scenery lauded elsewhere was irrelevant to the plot and the adapted story was a \\"baffling mix-up\\". A particularly negative review appeared in Variety, suggesting the film was so bad that its makers \\"might have got a little profit out of the raw [film] by not ruining it through putting St. Elmo on it.\\" The Chicago Board of Censorship found some scenes objectionable and required that Chicago showings of the film be edited to remove depictions of dueling and Murray's dead body. St. Elmo was a financial success, reported by The Photoplayers' Weekly as breaking box office records. The following year, Bertram Bracken directed a film adaptation of another Augusta Jane Evans novel, Beulah (1859), for Balboa. Though not directly related to St. Elmo, the 1915 Beulah film was marketed as a sequel. In 1923, Fox Film produced another adaptation of the novel, also titled St. Elmo, which was also a success. Around 90% of Balboa's films have been lost, probably including the 1914 St. Elmo. The Library of Congress is not aware of any extant copies.

Biography Igor Kokhanovsky was born in Moscow and attended the same school (from 1952, the same class) as Vladimir Vysotsky. The two developed common passion for literature and poetry, became close friends and exerted considerable influence one upon another. Igor was the first to start writing poetry and play guitar; it was he who taught Vladimir some chords. But it was Vysotsky who first came up with his own songs. \\"Semyonych, what's that?' - I asked, as he sang some. ‚Äì 'My own, I started to write such pieces.' - Out of sheer envy I wrote Indian Summer, a song dedicated to Lena Kopeleva (Lev Kopelev‚Äôs daughter), a girl whom I was in love with at the time. This song served for a while a hymn for our company,\\" Kokhanovsky reminisced later. The duo enrolled in the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineering but, unlike his friend, who dropped after a year, Kokhanovsky graduated and for a year worked at a construction site in Moscow Oblast. In 1964 he moved to Magadan to work there as a correspondent for Magadansky Komsomolets newspaper (1965-1968), as well as a gold prospector in Chukotka. This move, considered highly unusual in the times when the Russian Far East associated for many with the GULAG, inspired \\"My Friend Has Moved to Magadan\\" (Moy drug uyekhal v Magadan), one of Vysotsky's best known early tunes. In all, five of Vysotsky's songs have been dedicated to his friend. In Magadan Kohanovsky published his debut book of poetry The Sound Barrier (–ó–≤—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –±–∞—Ä—å–µ—Ä). \\"Indian Summer\\" (–ë–∞–±—å–µ –ª–µ—Ç–æ), often performed in its original version by Vladimir Vysotsky at his early concerts, became popular among Moscow students. In 1964 composer Tamara Markova (having heard 'Babje Leto' in a suburban train, sung by a group of young people) approached Kokhanovsky and asked for the permission to write her own music for the piece. Markova's version of the song was recorded by Klavdiya Shulzhenko. Dissatisfied with the result, Kokhanovsky asked composer and performer Yuri Antonov to come up with another melody. This third version of \\"Babje Leto\\" was recorded by the pop band Poyushchiye Serdtsa (The Singing Hearts). In 1976 Kokhanovsky recorded his debut album Indian Summer featuring the song \\"The Face in the Palms\\" put to music by Anatoly Dneprov, who's just left for the United States. The officials at the Melodiya record label asked Kohhanovsky to remove the track, he refused, and the album has never been released. His second one, The Discs Are Spinning, recorded in 1979 with Yuri Chernavsky and his Krasnye Maki (The Red Poppies) pop band, became a massive Soviet disco hit and by 1983 has sold 15 million copies. In 2014 Kohhanovsky published his new book, called The Mismatch (–ù–µ—Å–æ–≤–ø–∞–¥–µ–Ω—å–µ), about the \\"mismatch of my set of moral values with those dominant today,\\" as he explained. As of late 2014 he was working upon another book, Vysotsky Remembered featuring interviews with Alla Demidova, Yuri Lyubimov, Veniamin Smekhov and Eldar Ryazanov, among others.

It was designed by John Dalton and built from 1976 to 1978. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 February 2004.  History  A Queensland Cabinet decision of May 1973 established a policy of providing Halls of Residence for young people who were obliged to live away from home to attend classes. The Hall of Residence at Kelvin Grove were designed for short-term accommodation for country students undertaking Technical and further education (TAFE) block release apprenticeship courses (of 6‚Äì7 weeks duration) which were not available regionally. A site at Chelmer was originally proposed but after it was inundated in the 1974 Brisbane flood an alternative site at Kelvin Grove (originally part of Gona Barracks) was selected. This land had been excised from the Barracks site in the early 1970s when a right-of-way was created for a proposed North-Western freeway. The bulk of the Barracks site was on the western side of the proposed freeway, fronting Kelvin Grove Road. Land on the eastern side of the freeway alignment, with frontages to Victoria Park Road on either side of Blamey Street, was gazetted as a Reserve for a Technical College. The land on the northern side of Blamey Street was intended as the site for a new Technical Correspondence School. The proposed freeway did not go ahead after the Commonwealth government withdrew funds for urban freeways, and by mid-1975 that land on the southern side of Blamey Street was selected for the first Brisbane Hall of Residence. Against a background of criticism by the Australian Government of the standard of recent Brisbane buildings for TAFE the Brisbane architect, John Dalton, was commissioned to design the hall of residence in mid-1975. The building was to be staged with accommodation in Stage 1 for 120 students, 6 tutors and a warden and with provision for a future Stage 2 for a further 120 students and another 6 tutors. The design and documentation phases were accelerated so that construction would commence before a 30 June 1976 funding deadline. An initial design based on higher densities with self-contained groups of four students with kitchenette and bath room was revised in October 1975 to one of more domestic scale with a centralised dining/common room, to bring the project within a cost limit of $10,000 per student. The successful tender for $1,254,561 (slightly over budget) was received from Hornick Constructions and the completed complex was handed over on 13 December 1978. The building won awards from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) for meritorious architecture in 1979 and for civic design in 1982. The design of the accommodation at the former Hall of Residence was a departure from earlier halls of residence and illustrates the changing ideological and utilitarian needs of students at the time as well as the particular needs of short term occupants. There was a global shift that began in the 1960s in response to changing student needs brought about by sweeping social change, growing student numbers and economic constraints. Accommodation which was institutional and formal, where student movements could be more easily monitored and regulated was being replaced with that which provided students with more independence and a more informal living environment. This departure in approach to student accommodation is clearly demonstrated in the design of the Hall of Residence at Kelvin Grove through the scale and informal clustering of buildings and entwining paths which, on the steep topography, provide a measure of privacy without fully divorcing the activities in the dwellings from passing pedestrians, thus maintaining a sense of community. John Dalton (1927‚Äî2007) was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, England and came to Queensland in 1950. While training at the Central Technical College and the University of Queensland, he was employed in the offices of Theo Thynne and Hayes and Scott. Soon after he graduated in 1956 with a Diploma of Architecture he commenced private practice and quickly established a reputation for high quality design: He won a competition for a plywood display house in 1956, and for a project house in 1962. His work was exhibited in the Australian Pavilion at Lausanne Fair in 1959; in the Qantas Exhibition of Australian Architecture in London in 1962; and in the Australian pavilions at Expos in Montreal 1967 and Osaka in 1970, and in the Australia Council's exhibition Old Continent New Buildings in 1983; He won awards from the magazine Architecture and Arts for buildings in the ten best projects in 1959‚Äì60, 1960‚Äì61 and 1962. He won awards from the RAIA in 1962, 1964, 1967, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 He became well known through his domestic work which included houses he designed for himself in 1952 and 1960. Through the 1960s his reputation was further enhanced by his success in the Institute of Architect's awards programs, through his innovation in climatic design, through writing and publication of his work and through teaching. His early advocacy for reintroduction of vernacular elements such as verandahs, high-set houses, roof ventilation and climatic design generally was notable and influential and led to international exhibition of his work in Australian pavilions at Expositions in Montreal and Osaka. Dalton's success in the 1960s was a prelude for larger public and award winning commissions in the 1970s which included: * The Vice-Chancellor's Residence at the University of Queensland commissioned for Zelman Cowen (demolished 2000) * the Bardon Professional Development Centre (sold by Education Department and subsequently remodelled) * the Hall of Residence, Kelvin Grove * the Student Union building for Griffith University * the Arts, Crafts and Music Building, Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education Of these works, the Hall of Residence, Kelvin Grove is the only extant project which has a residential component. Early in the 1980s, Dalton largely closed down his Brisbane practice and moved to Allora. Dalton's work has international recognition, is widely published and is included in key texts on the history of architecture, including: * Banister Fletcher, \\"A History of Architecture\\" * J.M. Freeland, \\"Architecture in Australia: A History\\" * Richard Apperly, et al. \\"A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture\\" The project was commissioned by the Queensland Department of Public Works on behalf of the Education Department. Within the Queensland Department of Public Works the project was overseen by the Ukrainian-born architect Peter Prystupa (1920‚Äì1989) who trained in Vienna during and after World War II. In 1949 he emigrated to Queensland where he upgraded his European training to meet local practice requirements at the University of Queensland, joining the Works Department in 1953. In the 1970s Prystupa was responsible for commissioning architects with established reputations for good design, including John Dalton, Robin Gibson, James Birrell and Darvall Miller. Prystupa is said to have countered the opposition of the conservative (Country Party) Queensland Government of that time, to the Kelvin Grove project by emphasising that the housing was primarily intended for country students. In 1987, the responsibility for Technical and Further Education was transferred from the Department of Education to the Department of Employment, Vocational Education and Training. In the 1990s, approaches were made by the Queensland University of Technology to purchase the complex. These were initially rejected but in September 1993, the complex was transferred for $4 million -considerably less than the replacement cost. In the original scheme, five clusters of residential units were constructed around the community building. In 2002, three residential clusters were demolished for the development of the Kelvin Grove Urban Village. In 2004, the remains of the Hall of Residence - the two clusters facing Musk Avenue and the Community Services Building - was registered under the Queensland Heritage Register. As at 2014, the student residence complex is not in active use, occasionally used by the university for storage or temporary offices.  Description  Hall of Residence Unlike earlier halls of residence, the accommodation at Kelvin Grove is provided in small domestic-scaled buildings. These are dispersed on the steeply sloping southern sides of a southward sloping valley at the corner of Blamey Street and Victoria Park Road, Kelvin Grove. The accommodation units with south-east to north-east orientation are clustered in two groups together with accommodation for tutors and laundry facilities. These groups are arranged informally around the community services building which is a focus of the complex. This central core is sited at the top of the complex which steps to suit the topography and is interconnected with the accommodation by pathways. The overall impression is of a hillside village with a high degree of unity resulting from the repetitive use of pitched metal deck roofs, walls of white painted bagged cavity brick masonry and timber elements ‚Äì pergolas, balustrades and lattice screens all stained dark brown. The broken profile of roofs scattered and staggered over the steep slope and the consequent changing perspective together with the remnant regrowth eucalypt vegetation reinforced by landscaping based on Australian native species providing shade and shadow to white washed walls all serve to visually enliven the courtyard spaces and pathways on the site.  Community Services Building  The community services building is a two storey building which steps down the site and houses a communal dining room, recreation areas and support facilities on the upper level with store rooms and more recently enclosed areas on the lower level to house student counselling services. The building has a large open timber trussed roof and sloping ceilings lined with straw board panels. Pergolas provide shade to several outdoor areas.  Residences  Hall of residence The residences are divided into two clusters. One cluster comprises four two-storey 4-person maisonettes and one single storey 4-person tutorial unit, while the second cluster contains five two storey 4-person maisonettes and one single storey 4-person tutorial unit. Both clusters have their own laundry and one of the maisonettes in the first cluster had a paraplegic unit. Each maisonette has two bedrooms per floor with the entry, kitchenette and bathroom adjacent to the half landing of a dogleg stair. A timber framed cantilevered verandah with lattice panelled end walls is provided to the upper bedrooms with a corresponding paved area to the lower floor bedrooms. Additional natural light is provided to the common areas and upper bedrooms through clerestory lighting. The tutorial units comprise four sleeping areas, a bathroom, kitchenette and study and tutorial areas on one level with timber pergolas providing shade to openings.  Heritage listing  The TAFE Hall of Residence at Kelvin Grove were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 February 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Hall of Residence at the QUT Campus at Kelvin Grove demonstrates the pattern of development of the provision of improved facilities for Technical and Further Education in Queensland. It also provides evidence of the development of a climatically responsive architecture. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The project is an uncommon and intact example of a public commission by the architect John Dalton. It exhibits the principal characteristics of his work in the 1970s and demonstrates the successful adaptation and continuity of the themes that he had developed in his body of residential work into the public realm ‚Äì the marked differentiation between the contained and more open parts of buildings achieved by changes in materials and contrasts between solid core of white painted masonry and the brown stained timbers of verandahs and pergolas, and angled white walls and pitched roof forms projected at various angles in a distinctive response to the Queensland climate. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Hall of Residence at Kelvin Grove is an innovative example of student residential accommodation with a distinctive, relaxed and informal composition, and the complex is of recognised quality and interest which has won architectural awards, been widely published and exhibited internationally.

Wells St Andrew, or St Andrew Liberty, or derivations thereof, was a liberty, ecclesiastical parish, and later a civil parish, containing Wells Cathedral (which is dedicated to Saint Andrew) and surrounding land, in Somerset, England. History Bishop Jocelin established the area as a liberty, so as to be free from civil jurisdiction, in 1207.Somerset County Council Somerset Historic Environment Record: Wells Liberty The liberty was founded to provide housing for the canons of the cathedral, who were secular clergy. The Liberty encompassed broadly situated to the east of the city centre of Wells. The main part of the Liberty formed a walled precinct within the city (which was otherwise not walled) and this included Wells Cathedral, the Cathedral Green, the Bishop's Palace, the Old Deanery, and Vicars' Close. The Bishop's Palace was already surrounded by walls, but in 1286 Bishop Burnell obtained a licence to crenellate, so as to build gated walls around the wider cathedral close and adjacent residential complex of canons; this licence was repeated in 1340 for Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury. The building of the walls is believed to have filled a number of roles, including defending the ecclesiastical territory in a time of hostilities between religious and civic authorities, displaying the authority of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and possibly also in part as an element in the landscaping of the cathedral close and palace. Access to this walled area was controlled by a number of gatehouses and other gateways; many of these buildings still exist: the Bishop's Eye, Brown's Gatehouse, the Chain Gate, the Penniless Porch (all four constructed under Bishop Beckington, c. 1450-60) and the gateways at both ends of Vicars' Close. Much of the walls remain extant too, though in places have been reduced in height or have purposeful gaps. In places buildings formed the walled perimeter, especially facing the city centre; a notable gap in this built-up perimeter now exists opposite the Swan Hotel on Saddler Street, which allows for the hotel a direct view of the cathedral and a terrace by the Cathedral Green. The Liberty included further surrounding land and property owned by and with close connections to the cathedral, its bishop, and its clergy. Parts of the Liberty not within its walled precinct consisted of much the present-day site of the Wells Cathedral School, as well as a small area of the city centre including the Town Hall, some surrounding buildings and down to the Bishop's Barn on Silver Street. The Town Hall was originally the site of one of the canon's houses.English Heritage Extensive Urban Survey (2003) An archaeological assessment of Wells p 20 The residents of the Liberty had specific rights in relation to seating in the cathedral and were exempt from contributing to the fees for upkeep of the city. The giving of alms to the poor attracted beggars into the Liberty which annoyed the residents in the 17th and 18th centuries. There were also conflicts over jurisdiction between the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral and the city authorities.Historical Manuscripts Commission, 'Acts and accounts: 1734-1812', in Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Dean and Chapter of Wells: Volume 2 (London, 1914), pp. 526-546\\\\.

Wells St Andrew became a civil parish in 1866 which subsequently merged in 1933 with Wells St Cuthbert In to form the present-day civil parish of Wells, which covers all of the city; local government for Wells in this period was provided largely by Wells Municipal Borough.

The genus is known from Cretaceous fossils found in South America, Europe, and possibly Asia. The genus is composed of two species, the type species Principiala incerta, and Principiala rudgwickensis. History and classification Principiala is known only from three fossils assigned to the two species and an additional fossil tentatively assigned to the genus. The holotype adult of P. incerta, specimen number SMNK PAL 5352 is housed in the collections of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, while the partial paratype adult, specimen number SMNS 66000/255, is part of the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, Germany. The specimens are preserved as compression fossils in finely laminated siltstones, which were recovered from outcrops of the Nova Olinda Member of the Late Aptian Crato Formation in Northeastern Brazil. P. rudgwickensis was described from a single part and counterpart holotype, \\"BMB 025005, -6\\" that is part of the Booth Museum of Natural History in Brighton and Hove, England. The species is older than P. incerta, having been recovered from Rudgwick Brickworks which mined sediments of the Barremian Upper Weald Clay Formation. A single wing has been recovered from the Yixian Formation in China which was noted as probably belonging to the genus by Makarkin et al in 2012. The Brazilian fossils were first studied by the paleoentomologists Vladimir N. Makarkin of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Federica Menon from the University of Manchester in England. Their 2007 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. The genus name Principiala was coined by the researchers as a combination of \\"Principi\\", in honor of Italian entomologist Maria Principi and the Latin word ala meaning \\"wing\\". The specific epithet \\"incerta\\" is derived from the Latin incertus, in reference to the uncertain relationship of the genus within Ithonidae. Two years later a group of researchers led by paleoentomologist James Jepson described the second species P. rudgwickensis. The team chose the species name \\"rudgwickensis\\" as a reference to the Rudgwick Brickworks where the fossil was found. Overall the vein structure of Principiala is most similar to the genus Allorapisma, known from Ypresian fossils found in the northwestern United States. The wings of both genera show the apical end of the Rs vein fused to the MA vein. Both have similar positioning and shaping of the MP vein and the CuA vein running parallel to the MP vein. As such, Makarkin and Archibald suggested the two be grouped in an informal suprageneric group called the Principiala group. This group is one of three possibly monophyletic groups in Ithonidae, the others two being the Ithone group and the Rapisma group.  Description  The genus is identified by the short length of the antennae. Being approximately long, they are the shortest of the described neuropterans, with Rapisma having the shortest of the extant genera. The costal region of the fore-wing shows a regular series of cross-veins which gives the appearance of a longitudinal vein in the base area of the region. In contrast to the cross-veins of the costal area, the cross-veins in the subcostal area of the fore-wing are there are irregularly spaced and uneven. The area between the radius and median veins is notably narrow near the fore-wing base, and narrows towards the wing tip until the two veins merge. As with many Ithonidea genera, the head is pulled most of the way under the pronotal shield. P. incerta and P. rudgwickensis are distinguished by the characters of the species fore- wings, with an approximate length of for the former and only an estimated in the latter. In addition the last branch of the Rs vein in P. rudgwickensis is distinctly longer than that seen in P. incerta before the branches merge with the Median vein. P. rudgwickensis also shows a number of crossveins between the Rs branches of the Radial vein and the tip sections of the Rs branches are straight, both features absent or not preserved in P. incerta.

Early life She was born in Remuera, Auckland in 1941 and began weaving in the 1960s during her time as an Art and Craft Advisor with the Department of Education. In 1966, Sloan travelled to Sweden where she studied weaving at S√§tergl√§ntan. Returning to New Zealand, she married weaver Ian Spalding and they established a professional partnership. Her father Ralph Stanley Sloan had a brief career as a photographer with studios on Queen Street in Auckland, then as a movie theatre manager, however the bulk of his career was in agriculture. Although a strong history of seafaring is mentioned as inspiration for Sloan's Art practice, the family had a documented history of religious ministry and medical practitioners in the immediate family. Other notable members of the family were Sloan's grandfather, surgeon Hugh Rodger Sloan MD, BSc, DPH, Sir Donald McGavin and Lady Mary Allan McGavin, Dr. William Chapple a New Zealand-born British MP, British surgeon Donald Burns McGavin FRACS, and two reverends Thomas McDonald and Leonard Henry Hunt. Career In 1983, she became a member of the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and in 1986 was invited to exhibit in \\"Kahurangi\\" for the World Craft Council Conference in Vienna. Between 1998 and 1990, she served on the QEII Arts Council Crafts Advisory Panel. In 1994, she undertook a residency at Waikato Polytechnic. The following year, she became President of the Auckland Handweavers & Spinners Guild, serving until 1997. From 1996 until 1997, she was also President of the Combined Textile Guilds of NZ. In 1998, she held an exhibition at the Crawford Art Centre in St. Andrews, Scotland, where she created a large-scale work titled Sails, which drew upon concepts of voyaging and the Pacific. In 2000, Sails was installed at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts in Queens Wharf, Wellington. Style Helen Schamroth described Sloan's style in 100 New Zealand Craft Artists, Sloan's weaving is based on traditional twill, and she has developed a system of inlaying motifs that depends on a lively interaction of warp and weft. Her designs are based on balanced colour bands, intersecting diagonals, verticals and horizontals. The structure produces small spots of colour, which react with each other in a manner that resembles pointillism.\\" Sloan‚Äôs Sails holds personal meaning and reflects New Zealand‚Äôs pacific heritage, she explained, ‚ÄúMost of our ancestors have come to New Zealand by sail. Set in the South Pacific we are surrounded by the sea, regardless of one's origin and culture arriving by sail in NZ is historically important...I came from a long line of seafarers, originally from the Orkney Islands and London. This has influenced my perception of the importance of sail and what it represents....Sails are basic and timeless. My sail installations are an interpretation of the shapes, spaces, angles and movement that sails create.‚Äù Recognition According to the Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu, ‚ÄúSloan has contributed significantly to the acceptance of craft weaving as an art form in New Zealand.\\" In 1994, she was awarded the Committee Cup at the Auckland Handweavers Guild Exhibition, also winning a Merit Award that year at the Combined Textiles Guild Easter Show. In 1996, she won the Premier Award at the Combined Textiles Guild Easter Show. At the 2001 Easter Show was also won a Merit Award.

He has been dubbed Rhein-Ruhr-Ripper by the media, because his actions, mainly committed in the Rhine-Ruhr region in western Germany, share similarities with London's Jack the Ripper murders. Gust is classified as a sexual sadist. At a very young age, he showed a tendency to commit animal abuse. He experienced lust by torturing, killing and gutting animals. At age 13 he broke into morgues to act out his necrophiliac inclinations. After he was arrested, Gust stated that his greatest desire was to touch the beating heart of a dying woman. Between 1994 and 1998 Gust killed at least four women. His first victim was a 28-year-old hitchhiker from South Africa who lived in the Netherlands and was on a Europe trip. Her decapitated body was found in a forest area near Ede. In 1996 and 1998 Gust killed two prostitutes, whom he had picked up from Essen central station. His presumed last victim was a 47-year-old aunt of his wife. Gust placed the mutilated bodies of his victims in such a way that they could be discovered soon after the murder. However, the body of his aunt-by- marriage has never been found. In 1999 Gust indicated to his mother that he had committed a murder. She told a friend of hers, who informed the police.

Establishment and early years The collective was formed in 1992 by Selina Forsyth (Samoan) Niwhai Tupaea (NgƒÅti Katoa) and Suzanne Tamaki (T≈´hoe, Te Arawa, NgƒÅti Maniapoto). The sisterhood also includes Rosanna Raymond (Samoan), Feeonaa Wall (Samoan), Ani O'Neill (Cook Islands), Lisa Reihana (NgƒÅ Puhi), Jaunnie Ilolahia (Tongan) and is inclusive of Pacific Soles: Henry Taripo (Cook Islands) and Karlos Quartez (Cook Islands) and Greg Semu (Samoan). Throughout the 1990s Pacific Sisters collaborated in the production of fashion shows, art performances and musical events. Karen Stevenson, author of The Frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand writes, ‚ÄúChallenging the established art canon, The Pacific Sisters combined costume, tradition, dance and the catwalk with the energetic rhythms of hip hop‚Äù. The Sisters created a stage for expression of urban MƒÅori and Pacific identity within New Zealand, as Jacqueline Charles Rault wrote ‚ÄòThe Pacific Sisters were and remain provocative, sexy and rebellious‚Äô In 1994 Pacific Sisters performed at the Auckland Art Gallery for the opening of Bottled Ocean, curated by Jim Vivieaere. In 1996 the Sisters were invited and also received funding from Creative New Zealand to perform in Samoa for the seventh Festival of Pacific Arts: Tala Measina. They developed Motu Tangata, a contemporary realisation of the narrative of Ina/Hina and Tuna. The festival abstained from officially hosting Motu Tangata, aware of the implications a contemporary style of performance such as Motu Tangata could have at an event that celebrated customary practices from the Pacific. For two consecutive nights however, the Sisters performed Motu Tangata at the Hotel Kitano Tusitala. In 1998 their performance Tribe Vibe and the Extended Family Mix was selected as part of Sydney's Pacific Wave Festival. 1998 also saw their work exhibited in T≈´rangawaewae, the 3rd New Zealand Jewellery Biennale at The Dowse and in Raw Fish, at The Physics Room in Christchurch. In 2000 Pacific Sisters performed at the opening of the Biennale of Sydney in collaboration with Lisa Reihana. Recent years In 2011 Pacific Sisters reunited to present Pacific Sisters SOUTHSIDE: EyeKonik at the Mangere Arts Centre ‚Äì NgƒÅ Tohu o Uenuku as part of the 2011 Pacific Arts Summit. Their work 21st Century Cyber Sister is held in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. In March 2018 Te Papa opened its new art spaces, Toi Art. The opening exhibition included Pacific Sisters: Fashion Activists, \\"a celebration of mana wƒÅhine, indigenous identities, and the role this collective has played over the past 26 years ‚Äì through their collaborative works across fashion, performance, music, and film ‚Äì in giving voice and visibility to MƒÅori and Pacific peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand.\\" This exhibition toured to the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmiki between Sat 23 Feb 2019 ‚Äî Sun 14 Jul 2019 and provoked the following thought in an essay on the Auckland University digital platform Perspective in response to the question: In what ways does the Pacific Sisters‚Äô ‚Äòfashion activism‚Äô challenge pre- existing ideas of identity and gender?: \\"The Pacific Sisters‚Äô ‚Äúfashion activism‚Äù embraces hybridity to challenge the ways in which pƒÅkehƒÅ hegemony has determined their identity, by creating new dress forms and rituals that reflect urban diasporic reality, and reinforcing agency over their own gender representation.\\" Kate Harris Further reading * The Dowse Art Museum; Richard Bell, The Third New Zealand Jewellery Biennial: Turangawaewae: A Public Outing, 1998. *Ioana Gordon-Smith, From the Margins to the Mainstream: Pacific Sisters at Te Papa, The Pantograph Punch, 18 April 2018 *Thomasin Sleigh, Pacific Sisters: Fashion Activists, Art Asia Pacific, June 2018.

Later historians have linked him with two individuals of the same name. The first, a Northumbrian Viking who a led a fleet south and landed troops in Wessex in 893, and the second, a King of J√≥rv√≠k who reigned from 895 until around 899. Biography Sichfrith is mentioned by name only once in contemporary Irish Annals:Downham, p. 268 According to Downham, it is possible Sichfrith was able to claim the throne of Dublin by belonging to the same kin-group as the three sons of √çmar who ruled Dublin consecutively from 873 until at least 893.Downham, p. 25 Both Sichfrith and his rival to the kingship, Sitriuc mac √çmair, left Ireland in 893 to war in Britain. Sitriuc returned the following year but it is not clear if he or Sichfrith remained king.Downham, pp. 24-25; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 894 A commander named Sichfrith led the Northumbrian fleet against Wessex in 893.Downham, p. 73; Chronicon, IV.3 Though there is no way to know for sure if this Sichfrith and the one mentioned in the Irish Annals are the same, it is certainly plausible, and it is likely that there was contact between the Viking kingdoms of Northumbria and Dublin during this period.Downham, p. 73 Two competing theories have been put forward for Sichfrith's origins. Smyth has proposed Sichfrith was a Northumbrian who sailed to Dublin after his fleet landed troops in Wessex. According to this theory Sichfrith failed to take the city and caused the split noted by the Annals of Ulster.Smyth, I p. 34 Angus instead proposes that Sichfrith was a Dubliner who left for England after he failed to take the throne.Angus, p. 147 Smyth's explanation is considered more likely since √Üthelweard in his Chronicon implies Sichfrith was a Northumbrian. Coins bearing the name Sigfr√∏√∞r were found in the Cuerdale Hoard, indicating a king of that name ruling J√≥rv√≠k until about 900, succeeding Guthfrith.Downham, p. 79 Smyth and others have proposed that this Sigfr√∏√∞r is the same person as the Sichfrith mentioned in the Irish Annals and by √Üthelweard.Smyth, I p. 33-37; Downham, p. 79 These coins are the only evidence for a king of J√≥rv√≠k of that name.

He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and Exeter College, Oxford. During World War II he joined the British Army, serving in the Royal Armoured Corps with the Eighth Army in Egypt, and in the British Liberation Army in Europe. He wrote three biographies, all with a military theme: on the First World War English nurse Edith Cavell, on the Second World War German general Johann von Ravenstein, and on the Second World War British general (and later President of Marylebone Cricket Club) Oliver Leese. The second chapter of his only cricket book, Cricket Calling, a collection of essays published a few months before he died, is titled \\"The Essence of Cricket\\", and opens with this sentence: \\"Cricket is not so much a game as an extension of being English: a gallimaufry of paradoxes, contradictions, frightening logic and sheer impossibilities, of gentle courtesy and rough violence.\\"Rowland Ryder, Cricket Calling, Faber & Faber, 1995, p. 19.

This algorithm is based on the social cognitive theory, and the key point of the ergodicity is the process of individual learning of a set of agents with their own memory and their social learning with the knowledge points in the social sharing library. It has been used for solving continuous optimization, integer programming, and combinatorial optimization problems. It has been incorporated into the NLPSolver extension of Calc in Apache OpenOffice.  Algorithm  Let f(x) be a global optimization problem, where x is a state in the problem space S. In SCO, each state is called a knowledge point, and the function f is the goodness function. In SCO, there are a population of N_c cognitive agents solving in parallel, with a social sharing library. Each agent holds a private memory containing one knowledge point, and the social sharing library contains a set of N_L knowledge points. The algorithm runs in T iterative learning cycles. By running as a Markov chain process, the system behavior in the tth cycle only depends on the system status in the (t ‚àí 1)th cycle. The process flow is in follows: * [1. Initialization]ÔºöInitialize the private knowledge point x_i in the memory of each agent i, and all knowledge points in the social sharing library X, normally at random in the problem space S. * [2. Learning cycle]Ôºö At each cycle t (t = 1, \\\\ldots, T)Ôºö ** [2.1. Observational learning] For each agent i (i = 1, \\\\ldots, N_c)Ôºö *** [2.1.1. Model selection]ÔºöFind a high-quality model point x_M in X(t) , normally realized using tournament selection, which returns the best knowledge point from randomly selected \\\\tau_B points. *** [2.1.2. Quality Evaluation]ÔºöCompare the private knowledge point x_i(t) and the model point x_MÔºåand return the one with higher quality as the base point x_{Base}Ôºåand another as the reference point x_{Ref}„ÄÇ *** [2.1.3. Learning]ÔºöCombine x_{Base} and x_{Ref} to generate a new knowledge point x_{i}(t+1). Normally x_{i}(t+1) should be around x_{Base}Ôºåand the distance with x_{Base} is related to the distance between x_{Ref} and x_{Base}, and boundary handling mechanism should be incorporated here to ensure that x_{i}(t+1) \\\\in S. *** [2.1.4. Knowledge sharing]ÔºöShare a knowledge point, normally x_i(t+1), to the social sharing library X. *** [2.1.5. Individual update]ÔºöUpdate the private knowledge of agent i, normally replace x_{i}(t) by x_{i}(t+1). Some Monte Carlo types might also be considered. ** [2.2. Library Maintenance]ÔºöThe social sharing library using all knowledge points submitted by agents to update X(t) into X(t+1). A simple way is one by one tournament selection: for each knowledge point submitted by an agent, replace the worse one among \\\\tau_W points randomly selected from X(t). * [3. Termination]ÔºöReturn the best knowledge point found by the agents. SCO has three main parameters, i.e., the number of agents N_c, the size of social sharing library N_{L}, and the learning cycle T. With the initialization process, the total number of knowledge points to be generated is N_{L}+N_c*(T+1), and is not related too much with N_{L} if T is large. Compared to traditional swarm algorithms, e.g. particle swarm optimization, SCO can achieving high-quality solutions as N_c is small, even as N_c=1. Nevertheless, smaller N_c and N_{L} might lead to premature convergence. Some variants were proposed to guaranteed the global convergence. One can also make a hybrid optimization method using SCO combined with other optimizers. For example, SCO was hybridized with differential evolution to obtain better results than individual algorithms on a common set of benchmark problems .

It was built from to 1942. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005.  History  Kelvin Grove Road c.1890 The fig trees along Kelvin Grove Road at the Normanby Fiveways, Marshall Park and Prospect Terrace, were planted either during the late 19th or early 20th centuries. It is possible that some may be associated with the work of Ithaca Divisional Board and Ithaca Shire Councillor Silvanus White, who reputedly planted many trees in the Ithaca district in the late 19th century. However, they are more likely to be associated with the Ithaca Town Council's extensive programme of town improvement and beautification in the early 20th century. During the 1850s a track passing through Kelvin Grove northwards to Newmarket, Enoggera and Cash's Crossing was known as the Northern Road, and remained the major route northwards from Brisbane until Bowen Bridge was constructed in the early 1860s. By 1881 the \\"track\\" was known as the Kelvin Grove Road. On survey plans of the 1860s, the Kelvin Grove area was marked as the \\"Three Mile Scrub\\". In February 1865 forty portions of one to two acres were surveyed between Kelvin Grove and Waterworks Roads, stretching from the Normanby Fiveways to Enoggera Creek. By the end of August that year some of these portions along Kelvin Grove Road had been subdivided into residential allotments ranging in size from twenty to thirty perches, up to a half acre or so. Local subdivision into small housing lots continued for decades, resulting in an early 20th century townscape denuded of vegetation. By 1881 the urban population within suburbs such as Kelvin Grove had grown so much that Queensland's Registrar-General was referring to the city centre and its surrounding suburbs as the metropolitan city of Brisbane. Despite this population growth, the Municipality of Brisbane had annexed no suburban land. Nor had any of the suburban communities surrounding the city centre sought incorporation under Queensland's existing municipal provisions. Therefore, the Queensland Government imposed local government, creating during late 1879 and early 1880 a number of Divisions ringing the city centre. Ithaca Division, which included the districts of Windsor and Enoggera as well as Kelvin Grove, Red Hill, Paddington and Milton, was created in November 1879, Kelvin Grove Road forming the eastern boundary with Booroodabin Division. In September 1887 Ithaca Division was subdivided into Ithaca, Windsor and Enoggera Shires, with Kelvin Grove remaining within Ithaca Shire. During the second half of the 1880s a more crowded urban core and a developing public transport system encouraged land subdivision and suburban expansion in Brisbane, including northwest to Kelvin Grove. By 1888 the Normanby Fiveways had become a busy centre. Tramlines were laid along Kelvin Grove Road during 1897 to 1901, and by the end of 1903 the tram service extended along Kelvin Grove as far as the corner of Edmonstone Road, handy to the Newmarket Hotel. Ithaca Shire was proclaimed a town in 1902. For virtually its entire existence, Ithaca Town Council pursued a policy of creating a distinctive and aesthetically pleasing environment, and of providing civic amenities such as parks and playgrounds. The Council's street beautification strategy is probably best known for the creation of Ithaca embankment gardens during the 1910s and 1920s, some of which remain along thoroughfares such as Musgrave and Windsor Roads. However, the planting of street trees by the Council, community organisations and individual residents also featured in many annual Mayoral reports. Ithaca Town Council minutes for December 1908 referred to suggestions from trustees of the sports ground now known as EE McCaskie Park, on the eastern side of Kelvin Grove Road, for the planting of trees. In July 1909 the minutes recorded an offer by the proprietor of the Normanby Hotel to contribute towards tree planting at the Normanby Fiveways. The fig trees on Kelvin Grove Road at the Normanby appear to have been planted around this time, judging from subsequent Mayoral reports. Reporting for 1909, Ithaca Mayor George Hall outlined how Shade trees have been planted at the Normanby, along the Kelvin Grove Road ... Alterations were made to a number of tree guards to prevent the continual destruction of young growing trees. The cost of planting and protecting the trees at the Normanby is shared by the ratepayer whose property they will most improve. The Mayor did not specify whether the damage was wreaked by people, horses, vehicles, or the plentiful goats. The widened road reserve now known as Marshall Park existed by 1893. Named for local Alderman H. Marshall and formerly known as the Kelvin Grove Playground, Marshall Park has long been used for children's recreation, although not officially reserved as a park and named, until 1978. An unsourced newspaper clipping held by John Oxley Library, dated 9 September 1922, includes a photograph which seems to show the fig trees in Marshall Park. A line of eight trees is already well-grown, reaching a height approximately three times that of a passing vehicle. Brisbane City Council plans for McCaskie Oval drawn in 1949 represent nine trees along the western side of Kelvin Grove Road. Photographs taken in 1958 confirm their large size by the middle of the 20th century. The Prospect Terrace triangular section of road reserve was marked on the 1901 Musgrave Road Tramway Estate map. At the instigation of the Brisbane City Council efforts were made to close the road reserve at the corner of Prospect Terrace and declare it a reserve for park purposes, but negotiations have not been concluded. The urban improvement works carried out by Ithaca Town Council extended over two decades. They included the planting of street trees by the Council itself, sealing of roads and improvements to footpaths and drainage. More mundane works such as forming and metalling, laying concrete kerbing and channelling, and footpath widening along Kelvin Grove Road were carried out over a number of years. The road featured in the surviving Mayoral reports for 1917, 1918 and 1921. The report of 1917 had commented that Kelvin Grove Road was very rough in places. By 1921 Mayor John Tait could report that Kelvin Grove Road had been metalled to the Town boundary. During the decade after the planting of the Normanby trees, Council continued to report the encouragement, and practical assistance, given to individuals and community organisations wanting to plant more street trees. In 1917 the Milton and Rosalie Improvement Association had submitted a request to Council for the planting of avenues of trees along Baroona Road and Nash Street. During 1921, the Town Council reported planting 147 trees. Furthermore, Tait reported that the residents are taking much more interest in the beautification of the Town, and already we have two streets in which trees are to be planted by the residents themselves. And for 1923, Tait reported that the many small reserves and little gardens about the Town are looking well and do credit to our gardener, Mr Jolly. During 1924 the community planted trees along Mary, Moreton and Castlemaine Streets. On the basis of the interest taken by the former Ithaca Town Council in landscaping and town beautification projects during the period 1902-1925, and available photographic evidence, it seems most likely that the fig trees which survive along Kelvin Grove Road between the Normanby Fiveways and Prospect Terrace, were planted during this period. The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Kelvin Grove as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the City Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code- compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non-reusable standard pillboxes. Frank Gibson Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war\\". Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at , and for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built- referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\"- and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Kelvin Grove were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. The shelter piers have been painted and seating has been introduced.  Description  Row of fig trees, 2009 The Fig Trees are growing in three separate but linked locations within a length of one kilometre along Kelvin Grove Road, from the Normanby Fiveways to Prospect Terrace. They create an important sense of approach to the Brisbane central business district along Kelvin Grove, which is one of the city's major arterial roads. The Normanby grouping comprises five (5) mature Weeping Figs (Ficus benjamina) on a median strip between the inward and outbound lanes of Kelvin Grove Road. Despite road widening and the new fly-over Inner City Bypass, the trees still dominate the local streetscape. A turning lane divides the group into two sections comprising two trees nearest the Normanby and another three to the north. At Marshall Park - a narrow island of parkland along the western side of Kelvin Grove Road, north of the Victoria Street intersection - seven (7) Hill's Fig Trees (Ficus microcarpa var. hillii) line the eastern side of the reserve bordering Kelvin Grove Road. Prior to 1978, when the reserve was proclaimed, the trees on part of the Kelvin Grove Road reserve. Beneath these figs are grassed areas with playground equipment. The trees provide a barrier between the busy road and the residences to the west, as well as greatly enhancing the character and visual amenity of this area. The Prospect Terrace grouping comprises three (3) Weeping Figs (Ficus benjamina) on the road reserve at the corner of Prospect Terrace and Kelvin Grove Road. This triangular plot also hosts several other species including palms, and the air raid shelter, now used as a bus shelter. The shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by four concrete piers. A fig tree branch has grown down onto, and then along, the top of the roof slab. It accommodates two freestanding seats, bolted to the floor, in each end bay. Paving abuts the floor slab to the south and west.  Heritage listing  Kelvin Grove Fig Trees and Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The fig trees are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland history, specifically several decades of continuing commitment by the Ithaca Town Council to municipal development, urban improvement and beautification, and the encouragement offered by the Council to local residents for the greening of Ithaca which had been denuded during five decades of intensive subdivision and building. The Kelvin Grove air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located at the corner of Kelvin Grove Road and Prospect Terrace is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The trees are important because of their aesthetic significance. Lining a major arterial road, these large and mature fig trees are significant as defining one of the gateways to the centre of Brisbane. Despite recent major road construction, the fig trees still dominate the streetscape in their respective locations, providing welcome shade with a distinctly subtropical atmosphere. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Kelvin Grove air raid shelter, now used as a bus shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The trees are valued by the modern community for their streetscape value, as was demonstrated by extensive community protest in 1996 when the Brisbane City Council proposed cutting down two adjacent fig trees for street widening.

It was one of the oldest and best preserved towers in Yunnan, and a symbol of Weishan, before it was destroyed by a fire on 3 January 2015. History The Gongchen Tower was built in 1390, the 23rd year of the Hongwu reign during the Ming dynasty, on top of the northern gate of the Weishan (then called Menghua) city wall. The city wall originally had five towers, but only Gongchen and Wenbi (ÊñáÁ¨îÊ•º) towers survived until modern times. Being more than 600 years old, Gongchen Tower was one of the oldest and best preserved ancient towers in Yunnan until its destruction by fire. It was considered a symbol of Weishan, and was listed as a key cultural protection site by the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in 1988. In May 2013, the State Council of China added the Gongchen Tower, together with other ancient buildings in the old town of Nanzhao (collectively known as the Ancient Architectural Ensemble of Nanzhao Town), to the list of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites. On Saturday, 3 January 2015, a fire broke out in the Gongchen Tower at about 3 a.m., which took firefighters two hours to extinguish. Most of the tower was burned down. There were no casualties, and the cause of the fire is still undetermined. Structure The Gongchen Tower originally was three stories high, but was reduced to two stories after modifications were made in 1650. It stood tall, on top of the tall city wall. It measured wide, and deep. The tower afforded a bird's eye view of the entire old town of Nanzhao. A horizontal board was hung on the southern side of the tower, inscribed with the calligraphy of Kang Qin (Â∫∑Âã§), Prefect of Menghua Prefecture during the Qing dynasty, written in 1771.

All but one of tracks on this album had been previously released on other formats (78 rpm records, 7 inch EPs and 10 inch LPs), but is the first 12-inch release of these master takes. It contains selections from six sessions recorded between 1944 and 1948, and contains a previously unreleased alternate take from one these sessions. Background Charlie Parker recorded seven studio sessions for Savoy Records between 1944 and 1948; five as a leader, two as a sideman. Twenty-nine tracks from these sessions were released by Savoy on 78 rpm records. Twenty-seven of these tracks were reissued on 7 inch EPs and 10 inch LPs under Parker's name (the other two tracks featuring vocals by guitarist Tiny Grimes). The longer playing 12 inch LP became popular in the mid-1950s and Savoy inaugurated its 12-inch LP series with two albums (Charlie Parker Memorial, Vol. 1 [Savoy 12000] and The Immortal Charlie Parker [Savoy MG 12001]) which reissued previously released master takes along with previously unreleased alternate takes. Savoy released three more 12 inch albums (this album, Charlie Parker Memorial, Vol. 2 [Savoy MG 12009] and The Charlie Parker Story [Savoy MG 12079]) completing the reissue of the previously released master takes, and the original issue of most of the unreleased takes from these seven sessions. Parker's entire Savoy ouvre was finally issued on Charlie Parker: The Complete Savoy Studio Sessions in 1978. The master take of \\"Koko\\", included here, is controversial in that it is unclear who, precisely, plays trumpet and\\\\or piano on the track. The liner notes credit Miles Davis with trumpet for the session, but also credit Dizzy Gillespie with both trumpet and piano. Several sources claim Gillespie played trumpet on this track, while others deny it. Some sources claim Gillespie also played piano on this track, while others credit pianist Sadik Hakim. See the article on The Charlie Parker Story for further discussion. The December 29, 1945 session was led by guitarist, pianist and vocalist Slim Gaillard, and was originally recorded for Bel-Tone Records in Hollywood, California, which released these tracks on 78 rpm records. When Bel-tone folded the rights to Slim Gaillard's recordings were acquired by Majestic Records which reissued these tracks, also on 78 rpm records. When Majestic folded, Savoy acquired the rights to this recording and subsequently issued the tracks on 7 inch EP and 10 inch LP records. This is the first 12-inch LP issue of these tracks.

The film was released on December 24, 1917, by Paramount Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Matthew Denton (Ray) finds out that, because the Centipede oil wells do not pay a dividend, the villagers consider his father to be a swindler. He leaves his mother and New England home to go to Centipede, Texas, to ascertain the cause of the shortage of oil. He becomes an employee under the direction of Banty Jones (Elmer), foreman of the wells, and a crook. He falls in love with Mabel Glenny (May), whom Jones considers to be his \\"gal.\\" When Mabel shows Matthew her engagement ring, Jones gives him a specified amount of time to get out of town. However, Matthew has found a valve that causes oil to be diverted to another company. He also learns that Jones is receiving the benefit from these stolen oil sales. A fight breaks out between the two men with Matthew the winner. Jones, humiliated, leaves, and Mabel is proud of Matthew. Back home the villagers are happy that the oil wells are safe and that dividends will be forthcoming again.

The Bashkimi society was the union of three previously independent societies: Shpresa, Drita and Dituria. Drita, a journal was the official publication of the Bashkimi Society. Its founder and leader was Dom Preng Do√ßi, Abbot of Mirdita. Other Catholic clerics who joined were Jak Serreqi, Laz√´r Mjeda, Ndoc Nikaj, Gjergj Fishta, Ndre Mjeda, Pashk Bardhi, Mark Shllaku, Dod√´ Koleci. The only non-cleric, Albanian politician Luigj Gurakuqi, joined later. Since Albanian-language groups were forbidden by the Ottoman authorities, it opened as a \\"religious society\\". Its starting objectives were: # Creation of an Albanian language dictionary; # Mandatory correspondence of its members with foreign press organs; # Establishment of a weekly or monthly publication of the society; and # Participation in the attempt to create a unified Albanian alphabet. One of its main contributions was the so-called Bashkimi alphabet, a latin script-based alphabet without diacritic letters. Due to differences of opinion on the future alphabet, brothers Laz√´r and Ndre Mjeda left the group to initiate their own society, called Agimi (\\"The dawn\\"), in 1901. The Bashkimi alphabet was discussed and approved in a conference of Catholic bishops held in Shkodra in 1902, and was presented as a main candidate during the sessions of the Congress of Monastir, 1908, where the Albanian alphabet was unified. The Bashkimi alphabet was rejected in favor of the Istanbul alphabet () by majority vote. However, due to lack of unanimity, the Congress was unable to choose only one alphabet and opted for a compromise solution of using both the Istanbul and Bashkimi alphabets with some changes to reduce the differences between them. Usage of the alphabet of Istanbul declined rapidly and it became extinct over the following years and Albania declared its independence. Within few years from its creation, the society published many works, the most important of which was the New Albanian Dictionary () of 1908. The dictionary included 13,482 words. It remained the most detailed Albanian dictionary until 1954, when the Albanian Institute of Science (a precursor of the Academy of Sciences of Albania) came out with its first standard dictionary, the \\"Dictionary of the Science Institute\\" (Fjalori i Institutit t√´ Shkencave).  Revolutionary activities  The Bashkimi society was not a revolutionary committee, yet it did have connections with newly formed Albanian bands operating in Albania and Macedonia. Due to the efforts of Nikolla Na√ßo, the director of Drita, there were also relations by the Bashkimi society with an Aromanian (Kutzo Vlach) organisation that was fighting in Macedonia against the Greeks. In 1902 a Congress of Ottoman Opposition of Ottoman dissidents was held in Paris. As the Bashkimi Society headquarters were in Bucharest, the Young Turks (CUP) requested Ibrahim Temo's assistance in inviting the organisation to the congress and through a telegram wanted to know from him in a quick response if they would participate. No response exists and overall Albanians from the organisation did not participate the CUP congress. The Young Turks contacted moderate factions of organisations that wanted Albanian cultural rights recognised by the Ottomans. Negotiations were undertaken by the CUP with a leader based in Leskovik of the Bashkimi Society and convinced him that Albanian support was needed for the CUP. The leader agreed to inform the headquarters at Bucharest and promised to defend an alliance of the CUP, Bashkimi Society, and additional Albanians. During the Young Turk revolution (1908), the CUP in its aims of securing Albanian support for its cause managed to reach an understanding with the Bucharest-based Bashkimi Society. In the course of the revolution a pro-government gathering held at Firzovik (modern Ferizaj) turned into a meeting calling for constitutional restoration and Ottoman authorities felt dismayed when they found out that some Albanians in the crowd were reading the Drita journal of the Bashkimi Society.

She created the dynamic stretching and strengthening workout, Essentrics, and the long-running PBS fitness TV show, Classical Stretch, based on Essentrics. Her study of the benefits of eccentric stretch training has also been the basis of the pledge documentaries Aging Backwards and Forever Painless airing on PBS public television. Early life and family A self-described army brat born in Edmonton to Lt.-Col. Laurence Esmonde-White, she moved with her family to Calgary, and eventually to Montreal. Her grandmother, Anstace Esmonde-White, and grandfather Larry were the hosts of From A Country Garden, a public television series produced by WPBS-TV that ran on PBS for seventeen years beginning in 1986. Her daughter, Sahra Esmonde-White, took over her grandparents' gardens and added an apothecary. Producer of many of her mother's television shows, Sahra is a co-owner of EWH Productions and hosts the Essentrics Workout Series. Ballet Canada's National Ballet School Esmonde-White began her career studying to become a ballerina at Canada's National Ballet School co-founded in 1959 by Celia Franca and Betty Oliphant in Toronto, Ontario. A photo in Dance Collection Danse shows her classmates and a young Esmonde-White smiling up at the violinist Yehudi Menuhin after his concert at Massey Hall. After her training, she worked around the world with the National Ballet of Canada at the same time that the company danced with Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, and other very well-known dancers such as Karen Kain and Robert Joffrey. Unfortunately, she broke a foot, and the injury ended her ballet career in her early twenties. Montreal studio Esmonde- White's next effort, her own company making homemade rag dolls, led to her becoming an executive at the toymaker Hasbro, but business trips kept her away from her child, who was then five years old. Separating from the corporate world and searching for the means to support herself, she started to teach fitness classes in a nearby church and soon had almost five classes per day.Esmonde-White (2018), p. 6. She opened a dance and fitness studio in Montreal, where she became a flexibility trainer and developed her own technique. Esmonde-White claims she was able to alleviate her persistent back pain using her own exercise program. As her classes became popular, she then had to train more teachers. She spent much of the next ten years researching and perfecting instructor training manuals.Esmonde-White (2018), p. 7. Classical Stretch Esmonde-White combined her own movements and elements of ballet, tai chi, and physiotherapy. Classical Stretch was designed to relieve pain, increase athletes' speed, and lengthen the muscles of the full body. The technique is continuous movement, usually standing. Barre work can be done using a chair or counter top. Floor work requires a yoga mat and optionally a resistance band and/or a yoga block. Esmonde-White's technique includes no weight-bearing exercises that can stress the wrist like yoga. Her movements are easy to do, unlike Pilates where people try for technically correct moves. She realized that her technique emphasized essentric movement, something that was known to sports medicine but had been sometimes considered wasted effort. It took a while for the idea of strengthening the muscular system by lengthening muscles to catch on in fitness circles, but eventually she prevailed, asking her students to exercise for about 22 minutes every day. She approached PBS with a series idea in 1999, and her technique has been a successful television program ever since. Classical Stretch is presented on more than one hundred stations across the U.S., and has more than three hundred episodes as of 2014. The program reaches approximately 60 percent of the U.S. market. The product of three iterations, Esmonde-White completed her textbook as manuals in levels one to four, Classical Stretch: The Esmonde Technique. She also hosts a suite of Classical Stretch DVDs.Fitness Expert Introduces New Stretching Program. Entertainment Close-up. July 11, 2012ESSENTRICS¬ÆStudio bilingual homepage in English and French Essentrics The television audience for Classical Stretch began as mainly women in their 40s and 50s, so Esmonde-White sought to expand her audience to younger viewers. Also Classical Stretch user-friendly movements turned off young males who like to tell themselves they are doing hard work in the gym. Until they try it, many young men think a stretch class would be too easy for them. Essentrics was developed with her daughter Sahra for younger audiences. They developed a teacher-training system which includes printed manuals and DVDs, and is available for distance education. Essentrics is presented for all ages and genders, and seeks to strengthen and stretch every one of the body's 620 muscles. Breast cancer rehabilitation Six weeks before taping of the first fifteen Classical Stretch PBS shows was scheduled to start, Esmonde-White found a lump in a breast and was diagnosed with breast cancer. After surgery, the cancer was contained and she required radiation but not chemotherapy, saving her from hair loss. She could not raise her arm above her waist and had underarm pain. She found that talking with other cancer survivors helped her spirits. Her daughter Sahra designed and found funding and crews to make a workout video with Esmonde-White that has been seen in many countries including Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Greece, India, South Africa, and the United States. Designed for people who have been treated for breast cancer, the workout can increase the range of motion of the arms and shoulders after a mastectomy and prevents lymphedema. Esmonde-White recovered in time for taping. Together, the Esmonde-Whites gave workshops and lectures to help others understand rehabilitation. Work with athletes and celebrities \\"After they felt how good you feel after it, it got pretty serious,\\" said Canadiens team captain Max Pacioretty. Esmonde-White and daughter Sahra have attracted students to the Essentrics studio in downtown Montreal, where they are in demand as bio‚Äêmechanics and stretching trainers. The longest-running professional ice hockey team in the world, the Montreal Canadiens, are followers as are students from the school of Cirque du Soleil. Sahra holds Essentrics sessions once or twice a week for the Canadiens during training camp at the suggestion of Pierre Allard, their strength and conditioning coach. Other fans include actresses Naomie Harris and Sarah Gadon, and model Lily Cole. Jessica Dub√© and Bryce Davison in 2008 Esmonde- White has worked with a number of prominent Canadian athletes: Sports Hall of Fame diver Alexandre Despatie, synchronized divers Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion, Olympic gold-medal goalie Kim St-Pierre, squash player Jonathon Power, figure skater Joannie Rochette, and pairs champions Jessica Dub√© and Bryce Davison. Prima ballerina Anik Bissonnette came to work with Esmonde-White for two weeks, and returned to dancing without her chronic hip pain.Esmonde-White (2018), pp. 69‚Äì70. The Essentrics studio website has a list of athletes and organizations that are students. Publications Aging Backwards Esmonde-White's first book, Aging Backwards: Reverse the Aging Process and Look 10 Years Younger in 30 Minutes a Day, explains Esmonde- White's method to balance the body's strength and flexibility. First released in 2014, and updated in 2018, the book became a New York Times bestseller. Esmonde-White explains two types of exercise. Concentric exercise \\"crunches\\" muscles, while eccentric exercise (her Essentrics) \\"stretches and lengthens\\" muscles. The latter exercise thus counteracts the \\"stiffening, shrinking aspects of aging\\". Forever Painless Released in 2016, Esmonde-White's second book, Forever Painless, offers her own approach to pain management, and is a guide to ending chronic pain for good through movement.

Reynolds (born 1964) is a fantasy artist and writer whose work has primarily appeared in various role-playing games and periodicals devoted to fantasy role-playing. The Unspeakable Oath In 1990, John Tynes founded Pagan Publishing as a vehicle for material related generally to the works of H.P. Lovecraft, and specifically to the horror role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. The company's first publication was the photocopied digest-sized fanzine The Unspeakable Oath. The black & white cover art was by 26-year-old artist Blair Reynolds, who also contributed some of the interior art. As the magazine developed into a professionally printed magazine, Reynolds continued to produce the cover art, which reviewer Allen Varney called \\"unsettling\\". In Issues #2 and #4 of The Unspeakable Oath, Reynolds also contributed the first two installments of a serial graphic novel, \\"Remnant\\", which editor John Tynes later called, \\"a wonderful graphic novel [...] the artwork was stunning and the story very intriguing.\\" However, Reynolds abandoned the story after the first two installments. Reynolds also contributed a written piece to Issue #4 (December 1991), \\"From the Investigative Journals of Mikhail Aksakov\\", but it was his cover art that was notable, featuring a topless multi-armed female god. In 1994, editor John Tyne commented that frontal nudity at the time was \\"a real taboo in gaming\\". Despite this, Pagan Publishing did not suffer any serious repercussions. However, there were repercussions the following year when Pagan Publishing released Courting Madness, an anthology of pieces from The Unspeakable Oath. The cover art by Reynolds featured a nude Rubenesque woman who seemed to be performing a sexual act on a Cthulhu Mythos creature. TSR, Inc., which at the time owned the popular Gencon annual gaming convention, banned Pagan Press from selling copies of the anthology at Gencon 25. Games 208 Reynolds also did art for DGP, but when the company began to fail, some contributors, including Reynolds, were either paid late or never paid. This exacerbated the discontent that Reynolds was beginning to feel about the games industry, which he felt was limiting his ability to explore the erotic and perverse boundaries of the Cthulhu mythos. In 1994, he stopped providing artwork and prose to industry publications in order to focus on his own personal projects via his own company, Games 208. Reynolds wanted to publish edgy Cthulhu mythos materials, and the first work was the sexually explicit horror graphic novel Black Sands (1996). However, that was the last publication of Games 308 until The Mysteries of Mesoamerica appeared in 2008. Return to games industry Following the publication of Black Sands, Reynolds returned to the games industry to illustrate The Unspeakable Oath, now a professionally printed full-sized and full-colour publication. Reynolds also found work illustrating various pieces for MegaTraveller by Games Designers Workshop, and Blue Planet (1997) by Biohazard Games. He also provided artwork for Pagan Publishing's Call of Cthulhu campaign The Realm of Shadows (1997), which elicited special comment from reviewer Ray Winninger, who called his reaction to the illustrations \\"a uniquely Lovecraftian and unsettling experience the first time I flipped through this booklet [...] I stumbled over Reynolds' drawings of horrifying ghouls and monstrosities, all executed in the same photorealistic style.\\" When Pagan Publishing released a new present-day military setting for Call of Cthulhu called Delta Green, Reynolds provided the sexually explicit story \\"Operation Looking Glass\\" for the companion fiction anthology Delta Green: Alien Intelligence (1998), and created the cover art for the sourcebook Delta Green: Countdown (1999).

She has been described by art historian Karen Stevenson as one of the core members of a group of artists of Pasifika descent who brought contemporary Pacific art to \\"national prominence and international acceptance\\". Education O'Neill graduated from Auckland University's Elam School of Fine Arts in 1994, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in Sculpture. Work Using a craft-based practice that employs identifiably Pacific materials, O'Neill's work is often collaborative or community-based. Karen Stevenson writes: > Asserting a Cook Islands identity, yet positioning herself firmly in New > Zealand, O‚ÄôNeill creates a position from which she can question, critique > and embrace Cook Islands icons. She noted ‚Äúmy art to me is really looking at > my situation as a Rarotongan. I have always felt privileged to have had that > background‚Äù. O'Neill was taught traditional textile crafts such as tƒ´vaevae by her Cook Islands grandmother, and believes that the value of needlework should be recognised. Works such as Rainbow Country (2000), a 'painting' made from dozens of circles of brightly coloured crocheted wool, questions the division drawn 'craft' and 'fine art' and challenges the attitudes that place low value on traditional women's work. O'Neill has also used plaiting and braiding techniques in her work to make pieces linked to mats and lei, yet more forms of art traditionally created by women. Her 1993 work Star by Night for example is a large-scale (6200 mm x 2935 mm) weaving made from florist ribbon, using a star pattern derived from Cooks Islands weaving techniques that refers to Pacific skies and traditions of navigation. In a 1995 show with artist Yuk King Tan at Teststrip gallery in Auckland, O'Neill showed a work titled Mu'u Mu'u Mama: three long frilly dresses, like the ones Cooks Islands women make for special occasions, suspended in the windows overlooking the street. Art historian Priscilla Pitts writes that the dresses, crafted out of nylon net curtains, 'acted like domestic curtains filtering and transforming our view of the world. The works ... spoke specifically of the ways in which her own culture celebrates and adorns the bod, and highlighted traditions most of us are unaware of.' The Auckland Art Gallery acquired this work in 2011. In 2006‚Äì2008 O'Neill participated in Pasifika Styles, an exhibition of fifteen New Zealand artists, mostly of Maori and Pacific Island descent, who were invited to make site-specific works throughout the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge that responded to objects in the museum's collection. For her collaborative work The Living Room with Tracey Tawhaio O'Neill 'domesticated' a corner of the museum, creating a lounge setting. Tawhaio painted curvilinear designs over the gallery window and made wallpaper from newspaper overpainted with bright colours to obscure sections and highlight certain phrases; O'Neill customised a sofa that visitors were encouraged to sit on, covering it in floral fabric and a crocheted throw rug. Also included in the installation were photographs by Greg Semu and a monitor displaying a documentary commissioned from academic and broadcaster Lisa Tauoma featuring interviews with many of the artists included in the project. The installation was completed by two Edwardian display cases filled with personal taonga such as hei=tiki, barkcloth, tattooing tools and hand clubs, all selected from the museum's collections but displayed without labels, as if in a domestic arrangement rather than a museum setting. The Living Room became a part of the exhibition that visitors would linger and relax in, a 'comfortable and familial interactive space'.  Career  In 1996 O'Neill represented New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific Triennial in Brisbane, and in 1997 received the Rita Angus Residency where she produced the work Cottage Industry, exhibited at City Gallery Wellington. O'Neill has continued to participate in major national and international exhibitions such as Rainbow Country (2000) at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Pasifika Styles (2006) at the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and Le Folouga (2009) at the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts in Taiwan. As a member of Pacific Sisters, O'Neill travelled, exhibited and performed in their influential events which, as Karen Stevenson writes, produced \\"new voices of self-representation that challenged the comfort and serenity of the stereotype\\".  Collections  O'Neill's work is represented in the collections of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and Auckland Art Gallery.

Background AIC was a finance company that collapsed in 1986. National Mutual were the trustees for the secured debentured holders. However, briefly between 30 May - 17 July 1986, AIC had not registered with the companies office its new prospectus (no. 3), which was a breach of section 37 of the Securities Act 1978.

National Mutual filed for an order for validation in the High Court, which was refused. Held The Court of Appeal again refused validation, as the Securities Act expressly prohibited validation. Richardson J said \\"[Section] 7 cannot be employed to negate the effect of a provision of the Securities Act. That would be inconsistent with the protection afforded by s 4. It follows that an allotment which is invalid under s 37(4) cannot be validated under s 7.\\" However, as the Securities Act only prohibited validation, and not any other forms of relief, the court granted relief in the form of damages, which was similar to if validation had been granted, effectively granting validation via the back door.

In 1893 L'Estrange commenced work with Edward Barton of the electrical firm Barton and White. In 1896 L'Estrange left Australia to study in England and Germany, later working for the General Electric Company in the United States of America. L'Estrange returned to Brisbane probably during the late 1890s, and became Secretary of the Brisbane Electric Supply Company Limited, which was reconstructed to become the City Electric Light Company in 1904. From the early 1900s until the late 1930s, L'Estrange maintained his involvement with electricity supply in the Brisbane area, serving as Secretary of the Ipswich Electric Supply Company and as a Director of the City Electric Light Company. L'Estrange was also a prominent member of the Queensland Institute of Engineers, and of the Brisbane division of the Institution of Engineers, Australia. During the late 1920s and early 1930s L'Estrange was also involved with the University of Queensland Senate. In 1900 L'Estrange married Mary Emmeline Alder, daughter of EH Alder, Chief Inspector of Public Works for Queensland. L'Estrange had acquired the land on which Huntstanton was erected by mid 1914. The architect of Huntstanton is not known, although family records speculate that the house was possibly designed by either L'Estrange or Barton, a relative of L'Estrange. The stone for the house was quarried reputedly at The Gap. It has been suggested that L'Estrange owned quarries at The Gap and at Grovely. It is understood that the verandah, hall and other indoor tiles were imported from either Italy or France, whilst the roof tiles bear the imprint of their manufacture in Marseilles, France. Family history records that for a short time the L'Estranges lived with Mary's mother in Clyde Road Herston, moving to Huntstanton . In 1929 L'Estrange sold Huntstanton to Brisbane medical practitioner Dr James Vincent Duhig, nephew of Archbishop James Duhig. Duhig had studied medicine at Sydney University, prior to serving as a medical officer in the Australian Imperial Forces from 1917 until 1919. Following the war Duhig studied pathology at King's College Hospital in London, before returning to Australia where he practiced as a pathologist from 1920, and established pathology laboratories at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital also in 1920, and at the Brisbane General Hospital in 1924. Duhig is described as being a militant campaigner for the establishment of a medical school at the University of Queensland, and in 1938 he became the first professor of pathology at the University. Duhig also founded the Red Cross Blood Bank in Queensland. In October 1955, Duhig offered Huntstanton for sale to the then Queensland Branch of the British Medical Association (BMA). The inaugural meeting of the Queensland Branch of the BMA was held in Brisbane in May 1894, the role of the association being to advance the cause of medical science. There had previously been three attempts to form a medical association in Queensland; in 1871, 1882 and in 1886 as the Queensland Medical Society which eventually amalgamated with the Queensland Branch of the BMA in 1900. The first headquarters of the Queensland Branch of the BMA was a property in Adelaide Street, acquired by the association in 1912. In 1936 the association moved to a building on Wickham Terrace, which it named BMA House. By the 1950s, additional facilities were required by the association, and estimates were prepared for the erection of a new building on land behind BMA House. Following Duhig's offer in 1955, the association rescinded its plans to develop the Wickham Terrace property, and purchased Huntstanton, renaming it BMA House. Possibly also a factor influencing the association's decision, was the location of Huntstanton in close proximity to both the city and the Brisbane Hospital and the Medical School. The first meeting of the association in its new premises was held in December 1957. The name of the building was changed to AMA House in 1963, reflecting the change from the BMA to the Australian Medical Association. A hall and additional office space was required by the early 1960s, and plans were prepared by the firm of Lange Powell, Dods and Thorpe for a new building to the northwest of AMA House. The new building was connected to AMA House via a walkway, and was officially opened in 1965, becoming the main administration building for the AMA. Alterations undertaken to AMA House have included the erection of partitions, and enclosing the verandah along the northeast side of the building with glass. The AMA continues to use AMA House as a venue for meetings and functions, and a library/archive is also located in the building. Parts of the ground and first floor area are presently (May 1995) leased to private firms.  Description  Oriel window, 2008 AMA House is a two storeyed house, with external faces clad in rough-cut granite. The building is on the highest part of the block, facing NNE, with expansive views of the surrounding suburbs. The property is entered via a driveway from L'Estrange Terrace which extends to the front of house. A large granite fence, with a tall circular fence post, bounds the property from L'Estrange Terrace on the eastern side of the driveway. Several large, established trees and early gardens are found around the house. AMA House is asymmetrically arranged, with a T-shaped plan running east-west, with the transverse section at the western end. The house has a gabled roof with overhanging eaves, of Marsailles terracotta interlocking tiles, with several variously shaped sections emphasising elements of the plan. The house has steel members used in otherwise loadbearing construction. The northern elevation features an attached circular tower at the eastern end, protruding over the roof line. The tower, which is a feature element of the exterior of the house, is roofed with an onion shaped copper tiled dome, surmounted by a simple finial. A large crest carved into the face of the granite and partially painted red, is featured on the tower, directly below the dome. At the western end of the northern facade, is a full length projecting circular bay, similar in size and scale to the tower at the other end. The bay features window openings with curved glass and leadlight glazing. The western facade features a rectangular oriel window on the first storey, supported on oversized carved granite corbels. Below this is the principal entrance to the lower floor, through double timber doors, large enough for use as garage doors. The first floor of the building forms the original principal living and dining space, and the lower floor housed a garage or carriage storage, the kitchen and possibly servant's quarters. The main entrance to the house is on the northern facade, via a curved concrete stair, which terminates at a small porch on the first floor. The porch, emphasised by a discrete conical, copper tiled roof, is defined by pairs of turned timber columns joined by a timber frieze. The timber balustrade of the porch is integrated with a seating element. The first floor of the house has a reasonably open plan, which later walls have disguised to some extent. A large verandah on the north side of the house and a breezeway through the house to a morning room, to the south of the entrance form the open spaces, which are different in treatment to the rooms. The verandah, which accounts for nearly half of the width of the house, has large arched openings, with rough-cut granite quoining, with marble sill. These openings are also found in the morning room. Ceramic tiles are found on both the floor and walls of the verandah, black and white chequer-pattern tiles on the floor and glossy brown tiles, with painted feature tiles, to dado height on the walls. The breezeway is interrupted by an early concrete storage space around which a timber stair to the lower floor winds. The first floor has several elements of high quality timber joinery including architraves, window framing and skirtings. The lower floor is a more rudimentary space, with lower ceilings, very little decorative treatment and plain concrete dividing walls. The house adjoins a more recent building via a walkway from an existing opening on the first floor.  Heritage listing  AMA House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 July 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The house provides early evidence of internal open planning. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The construction technique, including the steel members used in the framing and the granite cladding is unusual for a house of the 1910s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is a good example of architecture influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and adapted to tropical climate. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. AMA House has considerable aesthetic value, the external massing, materials and detailing which combine to create a picturesque quality. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Erected by William L'Estrange, a prominent electrical engineer involved in the supply of electricity in Brisbane during the early twentieth century, and located on L'Estrange Terrace, AMA House has an association with L'Estrange. AMA House is also important for its associations with prominent Brisbane Doctor, JV Duhig, and the Queensland Branch of the Australian Medical Association.

The island was previously governed as Taiwan Prefecture, with its capital at Taiwan-fu in the south. With the reorganization beginning in 1885, Taiwan-fu was moved north to a new location in the center of the island, outside of the boundaries of the new Tainan Prefecture.
