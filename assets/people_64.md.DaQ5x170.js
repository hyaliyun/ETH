Tiene mayor demanda al inicio de este per√≠odo 26 Febrero 2009 Hoy Digital The dessert is part of the cuisine of the Dominican Republic and is traditionally garnished with milk cookies or with casabe, \\"a flatbread made of yuca flour.\\"Katrina Taveras Spilling the beans on a Dominican treasure March 19th 2008 Daily News (New York) Habichuelas con dulce is made with red beans, cinnamon, nutmeg, coconut milk, evaporated milk, raisins, sugar and salt. The beans are boiled with cinnamon sticks and sweet cloves and then blended to the consistency of soup. The coconut milk and evaporated milk are added along with cooked sweet potato chunks.recipe Cloves and ginger can also be added as flavorings. History The origins of the dish are unclear, some historians argue that Habichuela con dulce was derived from a Turkish dish called A≈üure or Ashure, also known as ‚ÄúNoah‚Äôs Pudding.‚Äù If this is the case, Ashure travelled to the Dominican Republic in the late 19th or early 20th century along with other classic dishes like Taboulleh and Kibbeh brought over by immigrants from the former Ottoman Empire and adapted along the way. Not only is Ashure made with similar ingredients including sugar, beans and spices, like Habichuela con dulce it is also associated with a religious period of fasting. ‚ÄúThe first month of the Islamic calendar is Muharrem. It is a good deed to fast the first 10 days of Muharrem, and then on the 10th day, the Day of Ashure, to cook and share ashure with your neighbors and relatives.‚Äù Another theory argues that Habichuela con dulce is derived from a French dish that was brought over in the 19th century by colonists who had settled in what is now Haiti before moving to the Dominican Republic via Aunt Clara‚Äôs hometown, Montecristi. How it's made Ingredients to make Habichuela con Dulce Everything is made in a pot. The thick, creamy appearance comes from a sweet potato. Red beans are used to make Habichuela con Dulce. The beans need to be soft, so they are soaked in water overnight. After the beans are soft, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk need to be added to the mix of the beans. Before adding the milk, the mixture is dark, but after adding the milk, it lightens up while boiling. Sweet potatoes and sugar are added for the rich and creamy taste of the dessert. While adding the sugar and sweet potatoes, the mixture can be left thick, or thin so that the mixture flows better, but if it is left in the refrigerator, it will thicken as it cools.What is Habichuela con Dulce Habichuela con Dulce can have added spices for a sweeter taste. While the Habichuela con Dulce is mixing, spices such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and vanilla can be added depending on the family's recipe. After the mixture is done, raisins and butter are added to the mixture. Usually, the habichuela con dulce is left to cool down for a few hours before it is eaten. The dessert can also contain cookies, milk or a type of cassava bread. Uses A similar form of Habichuela con Dulce is red bean paste, which is a dark red, sweet bean paste. It is used in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cuisines. Chinese In Chinese cuisines, red bean paste is used in: * Zongzi, which is a form of pasteles made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and is wrapped in flat large leaves such as bamboo and reed. * JiƒÅn dui, which is a fried pastry made from glutinous flour that can be filled with red bean paste. * Mooncakes have rich thick filling that is made with lotus seed past or red bean paste. * Red bean cake usual made with the outer shell of beans. The mashed beans are then mixed with gelatin and cooled for several hours before serving, just as habichuela con dulce. Korean *Bungeoppang This is a pastry that includes red bean paste and is roasted. *Hobbang This snack is a ball of flour filled with red bean paste. *Baram tteok Is a rice cake made with rice and filled with red bean paste. *Chalboribbang is small sweet pancakes that use a spread made of red bean paste. Japanese *Daifuku, which consists of small round kochi, stuffed with red bean paste. *Manj≈´ that is made of flour, buckwheat, rice, powder and red bean paste. *Taiyaki, which is a fish shaped cake filled with red bean paste. *Anpan that is a sweet roll filled with red bean paste.

It is believed to be the oldest public outdoor swimming pool in England. It is a Grade II* listed building. In the Georgian period Bath had grown in popularity as a spa town. The opening of Pulteney Bridge enabled the development of Bathwick and land to the east of the River Avon. The pools were built next to the river on the site of old marl pits. The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening the pools but they were sold had operated privately until they were taken over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as a trout farm before closure and falling into disrepair. In 2005 a trust was formed to raise funds for renovation and reopening of the pools. Public support and grants from bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund have aided regeneration of the site, which is expected to reopen in 2018. The original buildings survive, these include a caretaker's cottage and changing rooms arranged as a Georgian Crescent. The larger P shaped pool is long, while the smaller ladies' pool is long. History The baths were originally built in approximately 1815, by a local builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure baths, and are believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and developers, as Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing to put money into the construction of the baths. Map of Bath in 1818 showing both marl pits and the pools next to the river, in the top right. The pool was constructed on the site of old marl pits, between the river, the railway and Kennet and Avon Canal which had previously been used for bathing. It was originally known as \\"Cleveland Pleasure Pools\\", and was originally filled with water from the river. This was changed to the mains water supply in 1861, using cast iron pipes to bring the water under the canal. The position of the pools away from Sydney Gardens and the other attractions in the city centre, added to the downturn in Bath's popularity as a spa town, led to bankruptcy for the developers. The nearby Cleveland Bridge opened in 1826 making the crossing of the river closer to the baths. The site was acquired by Reverend Race Godfrey in 1827. He ran the baths until the 1860s, improving the facilities and providing a ladies' pool in 1827 and another small pool for children the 1850s. In the 1867 the baths were run by a Mr W. Evans who taught swimming, but refused a request from Bath Corporation to make it into a public swimming bath as this would \\"destroy its prestige\\". In the 1890s the baths were brought from the owners, The Bath College Company, by Bath Corporation's Waterworks Committee. They were then refurbished and opened to the public. The pool was extended in the early 20th century and shelters were added at the eastern end. In 1967 management transferred to the Bath Spa Committee who concreted the floor of the pool and added a cascade. Competition from the indoor pool at the Bath Sports and Leisure centre which opened in the 1970s reduced the public funding available. The site was closed in 1978 and leased to a private company; however, the venture failed, and it closed to bathers in 1984. It was for a short time used as a trout farm, but was threatened with demolition, as an alternative to repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for sale or long lease, and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from dilapidation. In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest. Restoration In 2013 an appeal to raise ¬£3 million was launched to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site and the possibility of flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft. In December 2017 the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) rejected an application for a grant of ¬£4.1M. to restore the pools. At a meeting with HLF officers they advised that while they felt that a number of outstanding issues needed managing, they considered the approved plans set out a really strong foundation for the future of the Pools. In March 2018 the Trust submitted another application to the HLF. This is the first round and will enable the Trust to prepare and submit a second round application, which, if successful, will release funds to carry out the restoration of the pools. If successful with the new submission the programme is as follows: Achieve HLF approval; December 2018 Confirm project funding; spring 2019 Issue tender documents; autumn 2019 Commence works on site; spring 2020 Open the Pools to the public; summer 2021 Architecture The larger pool, caretaker's cottage and changing rooms The swimming baths are in a walled garden, which used to include seating, and includes mature trees. The cottage and changing rooms are laid out as a Georgian crescent. Pools The P-shaped pool is flanked by a caretaker's cottage and six changing rooms each side in a mock-Georgian Crescent. It is long and wide with an average depth of . The rectangular upper pool is by and has an average depth of . Both pools have rendered brick walls with terracotta blocks used for the edging. Cottage and crescent of buildings The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, built of limestone ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows to the south and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of the cottage. Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of the cottage are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.

Robinson Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Lincoln Park, Michigan. It houses a Celestron SCT. It went back into operation in September 2009. First light ceremonies happened in early September. History HJ Robinson, founder of the Observatory In 1961, after Hector Robinson's science classes had built several small telescopes, the idea arose to construct a much larger instrument, which, when completed, would prove to be among the largest and finest available to pre-college students anywhere. The project would be one of the most lengthy and difficult ever undertaken by area students, but the students were enthusiastic and looked forward to each phase of the project, despite the hours of work and planning involved. Word of the operation spread, and soon there were enough donations from students, teachers and many others to purchase two large pieces of Pyrex glass (the mirror blank and the tool), each thick and weighing . Many crews of students worked to grind the mirror with various grades of carborundum, and tested and polished it to achieve just the right parabolic curve for a good mirror. After being coated with reflective aluminum, the mirror was finally finished, but the work was only beginning. Under Robinson's guidance, the students obtained a tube, in diameter, which, after being painted black inside and out, held the completed mirror at one end. A \\"spider\\" with its diagonal mirror, and a rack- and-pinion focusing device with eyepiece were then purchased and assembled. With the addition of a cradle and equatorial mount, the telescope was now complete. But this instrument did not become the heart of a real observatory until 1964, when the Board of Education authorized the construction of a suitable building. Before this, the telescope was stored on end in Robinson's science classroom, and on clear evenings, it was carefully carried outside and mounted on a stand. The footings for the observatory were poured in early 1964. A cement block cylindrical wall, in diameter and high with a central piling was erected. The whole structure was then topped off with a rotating metal dome and retractable shutter. This most lengthy and difficult project was now completed. There followed two exciting and productive years with the observatory in full use limited only by the weather. Portable telescopes were frequently massed around the observatory for large group showings of the moon, planets, and galaxies. Renovation and Upgrading After Robinson's retirement in 1966, interest in the operation waned. In 1970, after several years of infrequent use, students and several educators decided to renovate the observatory. In 1971, a students' club formed to use the observatory to further their knowledge of astronomy. The following four years were to prove productive. New eyepieces were obtained, as well as other needed equipment. Since the formation of the Astronomy Club, the telescope has been in frequent use. In the summer of 1975, the telescope mirror was improved to one tenth wavelength by a process of re-figuring and re-aluminumizing. In the fall of 1975, the Astronomy Club was delighted to accept the gift of a fine 35mm SLR camera, and began to experiment with astrophotography with the moon and Jupiter the first \\"subjects\\". The intended use and expansion of the observatory was laid out in 1975: \\"Augmenting the existing eyepieces with new ones is planned, as well as obtaining more photographic equipment. Further improvements in the telescope mounting and acquisition of a clock-drive system will help to realize the full, tremendous potential of the telescope. Expansion of the Club membership is also planned, as well as the possibility of fabricating new telescopes.\\"From the 1975 dedication flyer \\"The Hector J. Robinson Observatory is truly an invaluable asset to the school system and community, and the telescope it houses is one of the finest to be found. The foresight and diligence of Hector Robinson and his students of 1961‚Äì64 has produced a history and a future filled with the pleasures of accomplishment and the thrill of discovery, which are immense beyond measure.From the first two pages of Hector J. Robinson Dedication program, November 7, 1975 at that time, the observatory had a plaque inscribed with a date of 1965, which was the construction date, and a re-dedication with 1975 listed on it; however, the Lincoln Park School Board did not rename the observatory for Robinson until 1975. A dedication name resolution reprint is found in the dedication flyer. A description of the telescope and how it works was also in the program. The dedication program was written by Ron Greenough. In the school years of 1974‚Äì1977, Greg Knekleian was a member of the Astronomy Club, and was the president of the club, which was based in Huff Jr. High, in 1976‚Äì77. During that time the club members built three telescopes to learn about telescope building, have a project to work on during the daylight hours, and have a rich field instrument to augment the narrow field of view of the main telescope mounted inside the observatory. The club sponsor at that time was Bruce Coultas, an 8th grade principal at Huff Jr. High in Lincoln Park, Michigan. Mr. Coultas purchased the necessary parts to construct his own Newtonian F5 reflector. Optical expert Mike Manyak, of Wyandotte Michigan and member of the Detroit Astronomical Society, became a sponsor and curator for the observatory. With Manyak's help, the club members were able to produce three telescopes. The club performed the most work on their own Newtonian, which was the second scope to be built at that time. Both the and Newtonian reflectors were F5 in focal length. They both had simple pipe mounts. The main mirrors were both ground from mirror kits by the club. Actual final figuring of the parabolic curves was performed by Mike Manyak, as the mirrors had a Turned Down Edge problem. TDE (turned down edge) is a problem that plagues mirror builders, especially beginners and often experienced builders as well. The first and second telescopes built during the 1977 time period had fiberglass tubes, which the club fiber glassed and sanded, then painted. They were both powder blue. The third small telescope had a simple painted cardboard tube and was very lightweight. The third telescope was a small F4 reflector, which was the student president's personal telescope. This optically patterned after an Edmund Astroscan 2000 sold at the time. This last mirror was primarily ground and polished without help from the club, by the student, but Mr. Manyak did the final finishing and testing using a Foucault tester in Wyandotte Michigan. The Newtonian was housed in the observatory with the main telescope in 1977 when it was built. There is an article in the local Mellus Newspaper, which shows some of the club members \\"polishing\\" the mirror for the Newtonian. (Image to follow later.) At that time, the club had the most members on record. With 35 members at its peak. But only 1/3 of them were active, many having other pursuits and clubs to attend. The club perhaps remained active for only a few more years. Huff Jr. High school was torn down. A flat field existed there for some years, before a middle school was built again. The observatory and football field remained next to the old Huff School site, still adjacent to Lincoln Park High school. Mike Manyak was the curator and still opened up the observatory for a time. It stayed in use until perhaps 1980 or 1981 according to the account of one nearby neighbor. Mike Manyak was involved with astronomy until he died in 1998. The observatory then went into a dormant period after 1982. Bruce Coultas died and without a middle school club, there was little interest in the observatory. During the 1970s, those in high school were not interested for the most part in the observatory or club and viewed it as a \\"Jr. High\\" club or interest. In the 1970s: 9th graders attended the Jr. High and only 10th, 11th and 12th graders attended the Lincoln Park High School. It's difficult to say when the observatory was last used or finally locked up. Actual physically work in restoring the observatory began in late 2008. Both telescopes sat in the observatory unused, for years up until 2008. In 2001 Dr. Timothy Dey learned about the observatory and first surveyed the site. He dreamed and worked toward a plan to restore the observatory. Being an amateur astronomer himself and living in Lincoln Park, he sought out a means to reactivate the observatory and bring it back into use. Leo Macmaster, an 8th grade science teacher and Dr. Dey worked together wrote a grant application for funds to revitalize the observatory. They won a grant from Toshiba Incorporated. The grant initially larger, was reduced from its initial award due to the economic downturn of 2008. The observatory was found to still house the original telescope and the Newtonian reflector, but many starlings over the years had nested in the observatory and many bird droppings coated the mirrors of both instruments. The observatory had to be fixed up and the older instruments removed. Parts of the original scaffolding used to climb up and view through the old Newtonian were used as a part of a raised floor. Viewers no longer have to climb a large wooden scaffold to peer through an eyepiece off the floor. The SCT telescope has an eyepiece at the back of the telescope. The reflective surface of the was missing aluminum finish. The Newtonian had the same problems, with the acid from the bird droppings etching the previously fine surface of both mirrors. The Ford Amateur Astronomy Club (located in Dearborn Michigan) helped lead the way with their Astronomical expertise. Joseph Griggs construction company, led by Lions Club member J. R. Griggs helped much in building restoration and construction of a new raised floor, wiring, cleanup and painting. Joseph Griggs was a member of Hector J Robinson's class back in the 1960s and actually worked on the mirror with many other students when the first telescope was being built. So old students were returning and volunteering to help restore the new observatory. There was even help from the mayor of Lincoln Park who helped find resources to help us get a cement path to the observatory. The new telescope has been installed and the observatory is now operational since September 2009. The old telescope was removed. At the time of this writing, it's unclear what will happen with the Newtonian built in 1977, it may be reconditioned eventually and was scrapped but recovered from the scrapyard destination by an old Jr. High club member. The new main telescope mounted in the observatory is a Celestron C-14. It has computer control, go to, and tracking capability as well as astrophotography capability. The observatory will also have a WIFI hookup and many other updates are planned. One goal is to eventually allow the observatory to be linked into a remote control network that allows children from other schools to observe through it over the internet. A network of schools uses this type of internet link up to share telescopes and allow day viewing using telescopes linked in on the other side of the world, in a night time environment.

In the cast the apex is depressed, small and not quite marginal. An obtuse carination extends across the length of the shell. The surface of cast shows remains of very fine radiating lines, that are scarcely visible without a magnifier, and a few obscure lines of growth. The length of the shell is 10 mm, width 8 mm and the height of the shell is 3.5 mm. The height of the apex is 1.5 mm. Ulrich and Scofield collected only two specimens of this species.

It was an active season during which twelve tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1988 and ended November 30, 1988. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form. Of this season's 12 named storms, 5 attained hurricane status, of which 3 became a major hurricanea storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The most notable storm in 1988 was Hurricane Gilbert, which was at the time the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic on record. Hurricane Gilbert caused about $5 billion in damage and 300 fatalities. The other notable storm was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a category 4 hurricane, and caused about $2 billion in damage and about 200 fatalities. Joan crossed into the Pacific and was renamed Miriam. As a result of their intensity, the names Gilbert and Joan were subsequently retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.

The film is based on the book Le Dernier Mitterrand by Georges-Marc Benamou. Benamou had talked with and accompanied Mitterrand for the last 1,000 days of his presidency.Le Pr√©sident et moi, The Observer, 3 July 2005, p.11 Le Pr√©sident et moi Benamou worked for a small circulation magazine called Globe - a magazine for champagne socialists- la gauche caviar in the French idiom. It is not clear why Mitterrand chose Benamou but the journalist has said they got on well and discussed life, women and literature. 7th arrondissement of Paris. Mitterrand could walk in the nearby Champ-de- Mars. When the resulting book appeared in 1997 however, Benamou was turned upon by many of Mitterrand's family and associates - even Pierre Berg√©, who financed the Globe magazine called it a work of \\"absolute treachery\\" - and they would not help with the film. It seems they were particularly outraged not by revelations about Mitterrand's private life,-Mitterrand had a secret second family including the daughter he kept hidden from the public- or anything to do with Vichy, but with a description of Mitterrand devouring a plateful of ortolans. The bird is a protected species and eating them forbidden under EU law. Certain other people at the dinner called Benamou a liar saying this incident never happened. Benamou denied this. In 2004 one of Mitterrand's closest associates, who had also been at the meal said Benamou was right but no ortolans appear in the film and Mitterrand eats a plate of oysters. Benamou, an Algerian born Sephardic Jew, asserted that he had not found Mitterrand anti-semitic either in his time in Vichy or afterwards, - something that Mitterrand, who sometimes spoke of 'le lobby juif', his term for some French Jews' and their focus on his wartime record - had been accused of. Benamou defended Mitterrand in spite of his protection of collaborators like Ren√© Bousquet and Maurice Papon - \\"Papon became a minister under Giscard d'Estaing; he was chief of police under de Gaulle. This is not a secret of Mitterrand [but of] the French bourgeoisie and Mitterrand was an emblem of that.\\" The film won a C√©sar award for Michel Bouquet in his role as Mitterrand.

It is a collection of six buildings of various types from the 19th century, one of which is the oldest house in Genesee County. Stafford was the first European settlement on the Holland Purchase, continuously occupied since 1798. Together the buildings constitute a well-preserved 19th century Western New York downtown. All the buildings are still used for their original purpose, save a store which was later converted to town hall. It was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Geography The district is located at the intersection of the two highways, roughly midway between the larger communities of Batavia and Le Roy along Route 5. It is the southern terminus of Route 237, which leads to Morganville a short distance to the north. The area is a small hamlet of houses and commercial buildings amid a rural landscape of farm complexes and large worked fields, with a golf course to the north. All four corners are within the boundaries of these . On the lots are six buildings. All are contributing wood frame structures built in the 19th century. They include two houses, two stores, a church and a seminary. A small park at the northeastern corner was the site of a hotel which burned down in the 1920s. History Joseph Ellicott began his survey of the Holland Purchase, most of present-day Western New York, in 1798. He established a storehouse at the intersection of an old Iroquois trail and his eastern transit. The settlement quickly earned the name Transit, and a post office was established. The next year a survey crew working for Ellicott was boarded there. While waiting for work to start, its leader, James Dewey, cleared land for a small vegetable garden. This was the first agricultural use of the Holland lands. Frederick Walther, who had established an inn at the junction, wrote to Ellicott that the garden's yield was good, reflecting the quality of soil in the region. An 1800 map of that portion of the Holland lands denotes intersection as \\"Walther\\", likely since he was the only resident. By 1804 he had built a Federal style inn just north of the Indian trail. Five years later, in 1809, the Marvin-Radley-Diefendorf House was built in the same style on the southwest corner of the junction. Unlike the inn, it is extant, making it the oldest house in Genesee County. In 1822, settlement had advanced enough that the Town of Stafford was established. The Greek Revival Radley-Worthington House went up on the southeast corner in 1831. St. Paul's Episcopal Church was built next door in the Carpenter Gothic style in 1841. That year, the junction dropped its original name of Transit and began being known as Stafford Four Corners, since it was the center of the town. Seven years later, in 1848, the Greek Revival seminary, now used as a parish house, was erected next to the church. Sanders Store came along two years afterward. In 1890 the Odd Fellows Hall at the northwest corner, the newest contributing property, was built. Walther's hotel burned down in 1922. The site remained undeveloped, and is today a park with military memorials. No modern infill has been built within the district. Buildings alt=A large gray wooden building at the corner of a road with two pointy towers on either side and a less pointy roof between them. \\"IOOF Hall\\" is written below the central point alt=A white building with gentle pointed roof, pointed-arch front windows and a tall square tower on the front with a jagged top *Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge #222, on the northwest corner. This two-story 1890 building with a hipped roof, front gabled pediment and twin pyramidal towers was enlarged in the late 1910s. The south (front) facade has a metal canopy running the length of the first story and an unusual assortment of single and paired windows on the second. It still serves as a lodge, with stores on the lower level. *Marvin-Radley-Diefendorf House, southwest of the Sanders Store on the southwest corner. The oldest portion of this two-story five-bay hip-roofed brick house dates to 1809. A central Palladian window tops a full-length porch on the north (front) elevation. *Radley-Worthington House, southeast corner. An imposing front portico provides the entrance to this clapboard-sided one-story Greek Revival house built in 1831. Fluted Ionic columns support a dentilled architrave and large pediment, and a dentilled cornice with blank frieze runs the length of the house. Inside, the hallways have fluted engaged pilasters supporting an entablature and heavy flat cornice. One archway has a molded architrave with keystone. No architect is known, and it is likely that the owner, the Rev. Richard Radley, ordered these pieces from a catalog. *St. Paul's Episcopal Church, east of the Radley House. This 1841 clapboard-sided house of worship combines a Greek Revival architrave and pediment with pointed Gothic windows. The three-stage square front tower is topped by a balustrade with small turrets at the corners. *St. Paul's Seminary, next to the church. Now the parish house, this small Greek Revival building was originally a schoolhouse for the church. It became a seminary in 1852. *Sanders Store, southwest corner. Originally it was built in 1850 for a general store. In 1907 it began several years of renovations to convert it to its later use as Stafford's town hall (it has been vacant since the town moved to a newer building a short distance to the north on Route 237). Its combination of hip and gabled roof is one feature that reflects a combination of Greek Revival and vernacular influences. Other decorative touches include a cornice with pilasters supporting a large architrave, fan window with leaded glass in the north (front) gable field, and hip-roofed dormer window with diagonally muntined windows on the east elevation. An open-belfry tower with pyramidal roof on the northeast corner supports a modern fire siren.

The village lies west of a bend in the River Wylye and has a triangular street layout comprising South Street, West Street and Station Road. History To the west of the village lies the Iron Age settlement and possible hillfort of Ebsbury. The village pre-dates the Norman conquest of 1066, but was only a hamlet at this time. The name has evolved over the years, with recorded names including Wicheford (meaning a ford where wych-elms grow), Witford, Willesford Magna (mid-16th century) and Wishford Magna (early 17th century). Set into the wall of the church is a series of nine engraved \\"bread stones\\" that record the price of bread from 1800 (during the Napoleon blockade) until 2000. Wishford House, West Street, is from the 18th century. It was altered and refronted in c. 1800, and extended later in that century. Grovely Wood, between Great Wishford and Barford St Martin, was an extra-parochial area. By 1839, the boundary of Barford parish had moved north to include almost all of the woodland. By the Will of Sir Richard Grobham Howe (c. 1651‚Äì1730), a school was established in 1722 at Wishford for teaching reading, writing, accounts, and the Church catechism to twenty poor boys and twenty girls. In 1833 this had an income of ¬£63.5s and was teaching the forty children plus a varying number of \\"pay-scholars\\", for whom a small fee was payable.\\"Wishford ‚Äì School\\" in Public Charities: Analytical digest of the Reports made by the Commissioners of inquiry into charities. Digest of schools and charities for education (W. Clowes & Son, 1842), p. 303 The school's original single-storey brick building stands on West Street, opposite the churchyard; the school was extended (by building at the rear) in the late 19th century, again in the 20th and most recently in 2005. Parish church A church at Great Wishford was recorded in 1207. The present Church of England parish church of St Giles, built of flint and limestone, has a 13th-century chancel and 15th-century tower and was improved in the 16th century, but largely rebuilt during restoration in 1863-4 by T.H. Wyatt. The font bowl is 12th-century, on a 19th-century base. The tower has six bells, five of them from the 18th century. The extra-parochial area of Grovely Wood was added to the parish in 1952. In 1960 the church was designated as Grade II* listed. Today the parish is part of the Lower Wylye and Till Valley benefice. A rectory was built in the late 17th century, across the road to the east of the church. It was altered and extended in the 18th and 19th, and became a private house in 1976. Oak Apple Day Great Wishford is one of the few villages that still celebrate Oak Apple Day on 29 May each year. On this day, Great Wishford villagers claim their ancient rights to collect wood from Grovely Wood. This tradition is said to date back to 1603, when the charter of rights to collect wood in the Royal Forest of Groveley was confirmed by the Forest Court. The rights themselves date back several centuries before 1603. It is a matter of debate whether this tradition has been kept up continuously since the 17th century, or whether it was revived or re-invented in the late 19th century. The events of a modern Oak Apple Day include a \\"band\\" waking the villagers in the early hours of the morning, gathering oak branches from the woods at dawn, a village breakfast in the local pub (Royal Oak), then on to Salisbury, where there is dancing outside the Cathedral followed by claiming rights inside the cathedral by shouting \\"Grovely, Grovely, Grovely and all Grovely\\". (Although the charter requires just three 'Grovely's, tradition demands four ‚Äì \\"Three for the charter and one for us\\".) In the afternoon there is a formal meal, and other events for villagers in Oak Apple Field. These days, most villagers put more effort into claiming their rights than in exercising them: the handcarts used to transport wood from Grovely seem to have entirely disappeared. Amenities The school continues as Great Wishford CofE (VA) Primary School. There is a pub, the Royal Oak, but the village no longer has a shop or post office. There are also a cricket pitch and a children's play area which are shared with the neighbouring village of South Newton. The Wylye river runs to the east of Great Wishford, and is used for trout fishing. Wilton Fly Fishing Club, founded in 1891, is based in the village. Transport The A36 trunk road runs along the Wylye valley across the river from the village. Great Wishford had a station on the Salisbury branch line (Great Western Railway) from 1856 until its closure in 1955. Trains now pass through the village on the Wessex Main Line between Salisbury and Bristol without stopping. Bungalows have been built where the station platform used to be, and the station master's house is now a private home. National Cycle Route 24 and the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath pass close to the village.

The club was created when Kuopion Raittiusseuran Miesvoimistelijat and Kuopion Voimistelijat ja Rautatiel√§isten voimisteluseura united. The new name was Kuopion Reipas, and it offered skiing, wrestling, sports, gymnastics and football. After 1918, the Kuopion Reipas union dispersed, and new sports unions were formed Kuopion Urheilu- Veikot (1920), Kuopion Palloseura ja vuonna (1923) and Puijon Hiihtoseura (1930). The remaining ladies gymnastics division wanted to preserve the traditional Kuopion Reipas name and adopted the name Kuopion Reippaan Naisvoimistelijat ry. In beginning of the 21st century, sport unions wanted to return to the concept of unisex gymnastics sport unions as it was before. This was due to the male gymnastics unions that were formed as subsidiaries in 1990s.

Life Leo Raubal Jr. was the son of Leo Raubal Sr. and his wife Angela, Adolf's half-sister. Raubal Jr. worked in Salzburg as a teacher of chemistry. He visited his mother sporadically while she was living in Berchtesgaden. Like his younger cousin Heinz Hitler but unlike cousin William Patrick Hitler, Leo Raubal was a \\"favorite nephew of the leader\\", and Hitler liked to spend his time with him. However, according to William Patrick Hitler, Leo did not like his uncle Adolf and blamed the latter for the death of his sister Geli. This, however, cannot be confirmed, with Leo saying in 1967 that Hitler was \\"absolutely innocent\\", according to historian Werner Maser. World War II and detention in Moscow Before the war, he became a manager of the Linz Steelworks. In October 1939, he was drafted into the Luftwaffe and was a lieutenant in the engineering corps. He looked similar to Adolf Hitler and sometimes served as Hitler's double during the war. He was injured in January 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad, and Friedrich Paulus asked Hitler for a plane to evacuate Raubal to Germany. Hitler refused and Raubal was captured by the Soviets on 31 January 1943. Hitler gave orders to examine the possibility of a prisoner exchange with the Soviets for Stalin's son Yakov Dzhugashvili, who had been captured by the Germans on 16 July 1941. Stalin refused to exchange him either for Raubal or for Friedrich Paulus, and said \\"war is war.\\" Raubal was detained in Moscow's jails and was released by the Soviets on 28 September 1955, and returned to Austria. Post-detention career He lived and worked in Linz as a teacher. He died during a vacation in Spain. He was buried on 7 September 1977 in Linz.Joachimsthaler...

Gameplay The basement level of Paper Toss Paper Toss is set in an office. The player's objective is to flick a piece of paper into a bin. To make the game more challenging, there is a fan running in the space, thus the wind direction and speed are displayed, as they need to be accounted for when flicking the piece of paper. Players are scored on how many times they manage to toss the paper into the bin before missing. There are online leaderboards and 8 different levels: 3 office levels with small, medium and large distances away from the bin, an airport level to promote the sequel to Paper Toss, and Paper Toss: World Tour,Paper toss world tour announced.[http://appmodo.com/1119/paper-toss-review-for-iphone-and-ipod- touch/ appmondo paper toss review a dimly lit basement level, and a restroom level, which are all in the office.

Paper Toss Boss  Like its predecessor, Paper Toss Boss (originally Paper Toss 2.0) that released on December 8, 2011, follows the same objective. The newer version includes new locations, diverse objects to toss and special features. The new locations that appear in this game include a warehouse, the Boss' Office where a sleepy boss lies, and an airport terminal. The number items apart from the paper ball, that are available have also increased with the option of using various food items and household objects and grenades as well. The game also presents special new graphic features that were missing in the first version such as colleagues who can be hit with the paper balls or drawers, fish tanks and boxes that break open. Another speciality is the Intern level, where an intern carries the dustbin with himself as he slides across the office on his chair. Here, the player has to not only adjust the angle of the throw with the air current, but also time the intern's movement correctly to get the ball in. The game also features an achievement list which can be synced with Game Center.

Some Azerbaijani minorities also live in Markazi, Kordestan, Gilan and Kermanshah provinces. Azerbaijanis also make up significant minorities in various parts of central Iran, especially Tehran, where they constitute around one-third of the population.National Bibliography Number: 2887741 / plan review and assess the country's culture indicators (indicators Ghyrsbty) {report}: Tehran Province / General Council of the Order of the Executive Director is responsible for planning and policy: Mansoor Vaezi; run company experienced researchers Us ‚Äì * Publication Status: Tehran ‚Äì Institute Press book, published in 1391 * appearance: 296 p: table (the color), diagrams (colored part)  Turkmen  Iranian Turkmen are primarily concentrated in the provinces of GolestƒÅn and North Khorasan. The largest Turkmen city in Iran is Gonbad-e Kavoos, followed by Bandar Torkaman. Iranian Turkmen are mostly Sunni Muslims. Turkic tribal groups The Qashqai people mainly live in the provinces of Fars, Khuzestan and southern Isfahan, especially around the city of Shiraz in Fars. They speak the Qashqai language which is a member of the Turkic family of languages. The Qashqai were originally nomadic pastoralists and some remain so today. The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks each year from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480 km or 300 mi south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly sedentary. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s. The Khorasani Turks are Turkic-speaking people inhabiting parts of north-eastern Iran, and in the neighbouring regions of Turkmenistan up to beyond the Amu Darya River. They speak the Khorasani Turkic and live in North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, and Golestan provinces alongside Turkmens. Semitic Arabs 2% of Iran's citizens are Arabs. The historically large and oil-rich cities of Mahshahr, Behbahan, Masjed Soleyman, Izeh, Dezful, Shushtar, Andimeshk, Shush, Ramhormoz, Baghemalak, Gotvand, Lali, Omidieh, Aghajari, Hendijan, Ramshir, Haftkel, Bavi are inhabited by people who speak either Luri, Bakhtiari and Persian languages. There are smaller communities in Qom where there are a significant number of Arabs being of Lebanese descent, as well as Razavi Khorasan and Fars provinces. Iranian Arab communities are also found in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Assyrians The Assyrian people of Iran are a Semitic people who speak modern Assyrian, a neo-Aramaic language descended from Classical Syriac, and are Eastern Rite Christians belonging mostly to the Assyrian Church of the East and, to a lesser extent, to the Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East. They claim descent from the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia. They share a common identity, rooted in shared linguistic and religious traditions, with Assyrians in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East such as Syria and Turkey, as well as with the Assyrian diaspora. The Assyrian community in Iran numbered approximately 200,000 prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. However, after the revolution many Assyrians left the country, primarily for the United States, and the 1996 census counted only 32,000 Assyrians. Current estimates of the Assyrian population in Iran range from 32,000 () to 50,000 (). The Iranian capital, Tehran, is home to the majority of Iranian Assyrians; however, approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in Urmia and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area. Jews Judaism is one of the oldest religions practiced in Iran and dates back to late biblical times. The biblical books of Isaiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, and Esther contain references to the life and experiences of Jews in Iran. By various estimates, 10,800 Jews remain in Iran, mostly in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. BBC reported Yazd is home to ten Jewish families, six of them related by marriage, however some estimate the number is much higher. Historically, Jews maintained a presence in many more Iranian cities. Iran contains the largest Jewish population of any Muslim country except Turkey. A number of groups of Jews of Iran have split off since ancient times. They are now recognized as separate communities, such as the Bukharan Jews and Mountain Jews. In addition, there are several thousand in Iran who are, or who are the direct descendants of, Jews who have converted to Islam and the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Mandaeans Iranian Mandaeans live mainly in the Khuzestan Province in southern Iran.ÿµÿßÿ®ÿ¶€åŸÜ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ‚Äåÿ≤ŸÖ€åŸÜÿå ÿπ⁄©ÿ≥: ÿπÿ®ÿßÿ≥ ÿ™ÿ≠Ÿà€åŸÑÿØÿßÿ±ÿå ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ: ŸÖÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØ ŸÅÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ŸÜÿØŸáÿå ÿ¢ŸÑŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ŸàŸÜŸáÿå ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ: ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ⁄©ŸÑ€åÿØ: €±€≥€∑€πÿå ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©: 9789649064550ÿå ÿµ€∏ Mandeans are a Mandaic speaking Semitic people who follow their own distinctive Gnostic religion Mandaeism, venerating John the Baptist as the true Messiah.

The Holland Sentinel. Retrieved 2011-12-17. though Alarabiya has put their number as high as 60,000 in 2011. Caucasus-derived groups Armenians The current Iranian-Armenian population is somewhere around 500,000. They mostly live in Tehran and Jolfa district. After the Iranian Revolution, many Armenians immigrated to Armenian diasporic communities in North America and western Europe. Today the Armenians are Iran's largest Christian religious minority, followed by Assyrians. Georgians Iranian Georgians are Twelver Shia Muslims, whereas the vast majority of Georgians elsewhere in the world are Christian. The Georgian language is the only Caucasian language fully functioning in Iran and it's spoken only by those that live in Fereydan and Fereydunshahr, and in smaller pockets all over Iran. Almost all other communities of Iranian Georgians in Iran have already lost their language, but retain a clear Georgian identity. Once a very large minority in Iran mainly due to mass deportations by the various early modern age and modern age Iranian empires (Safavids, Afsharids, and Qajars), of their Georgian subjects, nowadays, due to intermarrying and assimilating the number of Georgians in Iran is estimated to be over 100,000. However, the amount of Iranians with partial or assimilated Georgian ancestry is estimated to exceed millions. The Georgian language is still used by many of the Georgians in Iran. The centre of Georgians in Iran is Fereydunshahr, a small city 150 km to the west of Isfahan. The western part of Isfahan province is historically called Fereydan. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around Fereydunshahr. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran. In many major Iranian cities, such as Tehran, Isfahan, Karaj and Shiraz, and Rasht live Georgians too. In many other places such as Najafabad, Rahmatabad, Yazdanshahr and Amir Abad (near Isfahan) there are also Georgian pockets and villages. In Mazandaran Province in northern Iran, there are ethnic Georgians too. They live in the town of Behshahr, and also in Behshahr county, in Farah Abad, and many other places, which are usually called \\"Gorji Mahalle\\" (Georgian Neighbourhood). Most of these Georgians no longer speak the Georgian language, but retain aspects of Georgian culture and a Georgian identity. Some argue that Iranian Georgians retain remnants of Christian traditions, but there is no evidence for this. Circassians Like with the Georgians, once a very large minority in Iran all the way from the Safavid to the Qajar era, the vast majority of the Circassians have been assimilated into the population nowadays. However, significant numbers remain present, and they are the second-largest Caucasian ethnic group in the nation after the Georgians. From Sir John Chardin's \\"Travels in Persia, 1673‚Äì1677\\": There is scarce a Gentleman in Persia, whose Mother is not a Georgian, or a Circassian Woman; to begin with the King, who commonly is a Georgian, or a Circassian by the Mother's side. Circassians alongside the Georgians were imported en masse by the Shahs to fulfil roles in the civil administration, the military, and the royal Harem, but also as craftsmen, farmers, amongst other professions.P Bushkovitch, Princes Cherkasskii or Circassian Murzas, pp.12‚Äì13 Circassian women were both in Ottoman Turkey and Persia desired for their beauty, while the men were known as fearsome warriors. Notable Iranians of Circassian descent of the past include Teresia Sampsonia, Shah Abbas II, Shah Suleiman I, Pari Khan Khanum (daughter of Shah Tahmasp, involved in many court intrigues), Shamkhal Sultan, Jamshid Beg (the assassinator of Shah Ismail II), and Anna Khanum. Traces of Circassian settlements have lasted into the 20th century, and small pockets still exist scattered over the country, even after centuries of absorbing and assimilating, such as in Fars, Rasht, Aspas, Gilan, Mazandaran, and the capital Tehran (due to contemporary internal migration). Their total number nowadays is unknown due to heavy assimilation and lack of censuses based on ethnicity, but are known to be significant.Pierre, Oberling Georgians and Circassians in Iran Due to the same assimilation however, no sizeable number speaks the Circassian language anymore. Recent immigration Most of the large Circassian migrational waves towards mainland Iran stem from the Safavid and Qajar era, however a certain amount also stem from the relatively recent arrivals that migrated as the Circassians were displaced from the Caucasus in the 19th century. A Black African population exists due to historical slavery. A substantial number of Russians arrived in the early 20th century as refugees from the Russian revolution, but their number has dwindled following the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian Revolution. In the 20th to 21st centuries, there has been limited immigration to Iran from Turkey, Iraqis (especially huge numbers during the 1970s known as Moaveds), Afghanistan (mostly arriving as refugees in 1978), Lebanese (especially in Qom, though a Lebanese community has been present in the nation for centuries), Indians (mostly arriving temporarily during the 1950s to 1970s, typically working as doctors, engineers, and teachers), Koreans (mostly in the 1970s as labour migrants), China (mostly since the 2000s working in engineering or business projects), and Pakistan, partly due to labour migrants and partly to Balochi ties across the Iranian-Pakistani border. About 200,000 Iraqis arrived as refugees in 2003, mostly living in refugee camps near the border; an unknown number of these has since returned to Iraq. Over the same period, there has also been substantial emigration from Iran, especially since the Iranian revolution (see Iranian diaspora, Human capital flight from Iran, Jewish exodus from Iran), especially to the United States, Canada, Germany, Israel, and Sweden.

The setting of the game is centered around a mysterious city: Malifaux. The city of Malifaux was discovered through a breach opening into another world. This world is a source of the valuable mineral known as \\"soulstone\\" which allows for magical effects. Games pit masters and their crews against one another for control of this resource. Released at Gen Con in August 2009, Malifaux uses a card mechanic in lieu of dice. Numbers are randomly generated by drawing numbered cards (1‚Äì13, with a Red Joker representing 14 and a Black Joker representing 0) from a ‚ÄúFate Deck‚Äù. The Fate Deck cards consist of 4 different suits similar to the suits of classic playing cards: ‚ÄúMasks‚Äù represent the similar suit of ‚ÄúDiamonds‚Äù, ‚ÄúRams‚Äù represent ‚ÄúHearts‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrows‚Äù represent ‚ÄúSpades‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTomes‚Äù represent ‚ÄúClubs‚Äù. A number of mechanics in the game allow for manipulating the cards flipped from the Fate Deck, including each player having access to a \\"Control Hand\\" allowing them to \\"Cheat Fate\\" and replace any card flipped with a card from their hand. The Malifaux Core Rule set is currently on its Third Edition.  The universe of Malifaux  The fictional universe of Malifaux as presented in the rules books and the online Malifaux Record and Wyrd Cronicles is both a city-state and a world in a parallel dimension. This universe is also the setting for the role playing game Through the Breach. The first known breach (also called The Breach of The Great Boundary) to this world was created in 1787 after our own world was threatened by the decline of magic and magicians looking for a new source of magic discovered a world separated from ours by a thin barrier. The creation of the breach destroyed the city surrounding the ritual site ripping the life force from its inhabitants creating a new equilibrium between the two worlds. Beyond the breach was discovered the city of Malifaux, surprisingly similar to many of our own but devoid of inhabitants. The new world turned into a new frontier when crumbling mining towns surrounding the city were rebuilt into boom towns in the search and trade of soulstones, the source of magic. With exploration continuing during the following decade, hostile natives called Neverborn were encroached upon. Tombs were discovered and with them the magic of resurrection. Discovered too were intelligent machines powered by soulstone. In 1797, the breach was destabilised by a blizzard collapsing while smoke and the sound of battle was heard Earthside. After turmoil the Guild was formed by those who had made the Breach in the first place, controlling the dwindling resource of soulstones left Earthside and preparing for its reopening. In 1897 the Breach spontaneously reopened. The Guild was ready and took control with the Breach and the reopened frontier fueling a new boom- trade in Soulstone. The present is 1901 Earthside. The Guild's control is precarious. Lesser, unstable breaches have appeared. A significant part of the workforce have organised themselves in the Miners and Steamfitters Union and smuggling is rife.  The city of Malifaux  The city itself is walled. Reclamation is underway, but large segments are still uninhabited, quarantined and walled off to protect the human population. A railway runs through the breach and into Malifaux as well as to a few mining towns. The city is run by the Governor General appointed by the Guild.  The surroundings  Around Malifaux human settlements are concentrated to boomtowns and pioneer towns.

It provides after-school programs. Currently, ASAS serves nearly 92,000 students on over 400 school sites in 14 regions across 10 states.  History  ASAS history begins in Los Angeles, where, in 1991, ASAS founder Arnold Schwarzenegger was invited to serve as Executive Commissioner of the Inner City Games (ICG) by Daniel Hernandez of the Hollenbeck Youth Center. ICG was a citywide health and fitness program designed to help at-risk youth develop self-esteem and a sense of personal value. The powerful impact ICG had on its young participants was unmistakable and inspired the creation of the Inner City Games Foundation (ICGF) in 1992. Between 1992 and 2000, ICGF expanded to 15 additional cities across the country. Based on research, experience, and dialogue with law-enforcement, it was clear that the after- school hours were when children needed ASAS most. ICGF transformed its model to provide after-school programming that was offered every day of the school year, supplemented with additional summer programming. In 2003, ICGF was renamed After-School All-Stars to reflect the significant enhancement of programming and holistic approach to extended-day learning. (Please see holistic education for more information) ASAS currently serves over 92,000 low-income, at-risk youth at 400 Title I schools in 15 major cities across the country: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Dayton, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, and Toledo. 93% of ASAS students are minority, 86% qualify for the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program (see National School Lunch Act) and 62% are in the middle school grades.'NYC MAYORS OFFICE\\", June 15, 1996 http://home2.nyc.gov/html/om/html/96/sp279-96.html Together they championed a national effort found through the Inner-City Games Foundation established in 1995 http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2007/03/19/daily10.html Program Details Introduction to the program Students who want to be a part of ASAS do not have to pay any fees. ASA focuses its effort on Title I schools. These are schools where \\"50% of students qualify for the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program\\". ASAS has about 367 chapters across the United States. Students never have to travel alone to a program and because programs are run as close to the schools as possible, otherwise transportation services are provided by ASAS. Target Market ASAS primarily serves children at the middle school level because it is usually the most neglected age group for after school programs. Most middle school students do not have the luxury of daycare services or after school activities and are often left with few to none safe activities to engage in after school from 3pm-6pm. Several studies have shown that if students are left alone and on their own during these hours, they are more likely to experience an increase in delinquent behavior and become involved with substance use and high-risk sexual behavior.  Demographics Served  After School All Stars serves over 92,000 underprivileged children in America.

History Note: Ship names utilized are the Original Names with text in italics. The numbers in parentheses following the Original Name is the Hull Number. The Jakobson Shipyard, Inc. traces its origins to founder Daniel Jakobson, who established the Jakobson & Peterson shipyard in Brooklyn, New York in 1895. Jakobson was a native of Sweden who immigrated to the United States in 1877. His son, Irving Jakobson, succeeded him as President in 1925. The elder Jakobson died November 28, 1931 at his residence on 370 Senator Street in Brooklyn. The firm operated in Brooklyn until around 1938 when it was decided to move to Oyster Bay, New York. As many as 700 people worked at Jakobson's during the height of production around World War II. Four diesel- electric tugboats were built and launched for the Lehigh Valley Railroad from 1948 and 1950. These include the Wilkes-Barre (327), Hazelton (328), Cornell (329), and Lehigh (330). Of these, the tugboat Cornell is the last in service. These diesel tugs were meant to replace steam driven tugs used by the railroad in New York Harbor for towing car floats and barges. Among the benefits that came from diesel were eliminating time lost for fueling. Jakobson's produced and launched three fireboats for the City of Baltimore in 1960. These were the Mayor J. Harold Grady (397), P.W. Wilkinson (398), and August Emrich (399). The State of New York provided $5 million to buy the shipyard in 1997, from funds in the state's 1972 Environmental Quality Bond Act. The money had been previously designated for a waste incinerator on Long Island that had never been built. Gov. George E. Pataki speaking at that time said, \\"This cooperative purchase will recapture an important part of Oyster Bay's waterfront and the area's unique maritime character.\\" Officers and key staff around the time Jakobson's stopped operation were Mr. George J. Hossfeld, President; Mr. John Hossfeld, Shipyard Manager; and Ms. Robin Ritter, Office Manager. The publication Worldwide ship and boat repair facilities published around the time of closing described the firm as follows: > Operates vessel repair, upgrades, yacht and small boat repowering and full > service boat marina facility. With 2 marine railways to 235‚Äô and 1,500 LT, > 2,000 feet of total berthing, buildingways, and shops. Register of Ships Produced Data in these tables is from Tim Colton's web site.

The English term is a translation of the German Neuoffenbarung. Within the Christian church The Roman Catholic Church in principle accepts the possibility of \\"private revelations\\", and recognizes certain instances (in practice mostly Marian apparitions) in the sense of nihil obstat, i.e. the Church proclaims the possibility of a revelation being genuinely of divine origin without placing any positive claim to the effect. The Catholic Church agrees with Protestants in that public revelation ended with the death of the Apostle John. Private revelation is not binding on Catholics and does not inform any new doctrine. Some Protestant Reformers held different views, and taught that the miraculous gifts (including prophecy) ended with the death of the Apostles or soon thereafter. This doctrine, called cessationism, is still held by conservative Evangelicals (especially some Baptists and Calvinists), who believe that the Bible is the final and complete revelation of God. By contrast, the Charismatic Movement emphasizes the claim that prophecy is available to contemporary believers. Visions of Jesus and Mary have been common throughout the history of Christianity. The technical term of receiving revelations verbally, as opposed to in visions, is interior locution. For example, Mother Teresa stated that she had been experiencing interior locutions, but that she preferred to remain private as to their contents. There are numerous examples of such instances in Christian mysticism, during the medieval period and in the modern era e.g. Jacob Boehme and Emanuel Swedenborg, and later Jakob Lorber (1800‚Äì1864), Gottfried Mayerhofer (1807‚Äì1877), Bertha Dudde (1891‚Äì1965) and others. Proponents of neo- revelationism point to John 16:12‚Äì14, taking \\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\" as an announcement of continued revelation outside of the biblical canon. 12th-century mystic Joachim of Fiore also pointed to Revelation 14:6 which presages an \\"everlasting gospel\\" yet to be taught in the future. Opponents, on the other hand, tend to point to the warning against false prophets in Matthew 24. New religious movements Outside mainstream Christianity, there have also been numerous new religious movements led by people either claiming to be directly inspired by Jesus, or indeed to be Jesus returned. Other examples of notable neo-revelationist movements are the Unification Church, Universal Life, Church of the Last Testament and Fiat Lux. A number of movements of Spiritual Christianity in tsarist Russia also fall under this category.

First Collection. (Danish: Eventyr, fortalte for B√∏rn. F√∏rste Samling.) is a collection of nine fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen. The tales were published in a series of three installments by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark between May 1835 and April 1837, and represent Andersen's first venture into the fairy tale genre. The first installment of sixty-one unbound pages was published 8 May 1835 and contained \\"The Tinderbox\\", \\"Little Claus and Big Claus\\", \\"The Princess and the Pea\\" and \\"Little Ida's Flowers\\". The first three tales were based on folktales Andersen had heard in his childhood while the last tale was completely Andersen's invention and created for Ida Thiele, the daughter of Andersen's early benefactor, the folklorist Just Mathias Thiele. Reitzel paid Andersen thirty rixdollars for the manuscript, and the booklet was priced at twenty-four shillings. The second booklet was published on 16 December 1835 and contained \\"Thumbelina\\", \\"The Naughty Boy\\" and \\"The Traveling Companion\\". \\"Thumbelina\\" was completely Andersen's invention though inspired by \\"Tom Thumb\\" and other stories of miniature people. \\"The Naughty Boy\\" was based on a poem by Anacreon about Cupid, and \\"The Traveling Companion\\" was a ghost story with which Andersen had experimented in 1830. The third booklet contained \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", and was published 7 April 1837. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was completely Andersen's creation though influenced by De la Motte Fouqu√©'s \\"Undine\\" (1811) and lore about mermaids. The tale established his international reputation. The only other tale in the third booklet was \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", which was based on a medieval Spanish story with Arab and Jewish sources. On the eve of the third installment's publication, Andersen changed the end of his tale (the Emperor simply walks in procession) to its now familiar finale of a child calling out, \\"The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!\\" Danish reviews for the first two booklets appeared in 1836 and were not enthusiastic. Critics disliked the chatty, informal style and an immorality that flew in the face of their expectations that children's literature was meant to educate rather than amuse. The critics discouraged Andersen from pursuing the genre. Andersen believed he was working against the critics' preconceived notions about fairy tales, and temporarily returned to novel-writing. The critical reaction was so severe, he waited a full year before publishing the third installment. The nine tales of the three booklets were collected together and published in one volume and sold at seventy-two shillings. A title page, a table of contents, and a preface by Andersen were published in the volume.

The series was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Phryne in 1995, and then moved to Anise in 1996. The manga was later licensed by ALC Publishing for release in English, with the first volume being released on June 19, 2003. Additional Rica 'tte Kanji! stories have been published in ALC Publishing's annual anthology Yuri Monogatari. Rica Takashima has stated in interviews that one of the reasons she created Rica 'tte Kanji!? was to have a yuri manga that was happy and about everyday life, unlike most yuri of the time, which typically ended in tragedy or were in a sci-fi setting. Plot Rica 'tte Kanji!? story revolves around the main character Rica, a new student at a Women's Junior College in Tokyo. Having never met another openly lesbian individual before, Rica visits Shinjuku Ni-ch≈çme, Tokyo's gay and lesbian district. On her first night there, she makes several new friends, including Miho, a fine arts college student who eventually becomes Rica's girlfriend. Each chapter presents a slice of Rica's life, such as going on dates, preparing for Christmas, or doing college work. Characters ;Rica Takashima : The main character of Rica 'tte Kanji!? Rica is a cheerful girl who moved to Tokyo to attend a Women's College to study early child development. Rica can occasionally be a little na√Øve at times, but her sunny enthusiasm is infectious. Though she was first viewed as fresh meat on the dating scene, her new Ni-ch≈çme friends are quickly won over by her sweetness and innocence. ;Miho : Miho is a fine arts student who is studying textiles. She is one of the first friends Rica makes in Tokyo, and Rica turns to Miho for dating advice and platonic companionship. However, Miho's feelings for Rica deepen beyond friendship, and the pair later start dating. Reception Rica 'tte Kanji!? was given positive reviews from such sources as Animerica, a popular anime and manga magazine. The review praises Takashima's art style for matching the type of story she is telling, and states that the manga series' happy outlook makes it worth reading. Alt URL In a review at Comic World News, David Welsh commented that \\"[Takashima's] work is like a less accomplished version of Bryan Lee O'Malley's (Lost At Sea, Scott Pilgrim)\\", adding that the manga series is \\"an admirable and endearing attempt to put some fun into yuri manga.\\" Dillon Font from Anime Fringe complimented Rica 'tte Kanji!? for being \\"fun and enjoyable\\", adding, \\"[t]his comic work is beautiful, but lacks any real meat or troubles that would give the reader a more complete and fulfilling story.\\" In 2006, Professor Kerridwen Luis of Brandeis University chose Rica 'tte Kanji!? as course material for her Anthropology 166B course. The book was added to permanent collection of Kyoto International Manga Museum in 2011. Italian version was released by RenBooks, Bologna, Italy in 2011, E-book version was released as titled TOKYO LOVE Rica ‚Äòtte Kanji!?, and named one of Best Manga 2013 by San Diego Comic-Con International 2013, and Otaku USA.

Its first vehicle was a Leyland Tiger coach used on coach hire operations from a depot near Chesterfield. Two similar vehicles were added to the fleet in early 1996. Two school bus services were taken on in the same year and the fleet expanded to ten vehicles. In 1997 vehicles maintenance work was taken in-house by the company, and work on National Express services was introduced. The company moved into scheduled bus service operation in 1999, winning a contract from Derbyshire County Council. A local route in Bolsover was launched a year later.

Not much is known of his early life. He was smuggled out of Modena with his older brother when he was eighteen years old. He stayed in Geneva with his uncle, the humanist critic, Ludovico Castelvetro. He traveled widely for several years, living in the towns of Lyon, Basel, Vienna and Chiavenna before his uncle died. In 1587 in Basel he married Isotta de Canonici, the widow of Thomas Erastus. In 1613 he was living at Charlton House the home of Adam Newton, tutor to Prince Henry.Joan Thirsk,Food in Early Modern England (London, 2007), p. 67. He died impoverished on 21 March 1616 after a long illness. Protestantism Having become a Protestant he feared for his life when he returned to Italy in 1578 after the death of his father. He swiftly went to England in 1580 after selling his property. From 1598 he settled in Venice. It was there that his brother Lelio was burnt at the stake as a heretic in 1609. In 1611 he was imprisoned by the inquisition but was rescued by the English ambassador Sir Dudley Carleton who threatened a diplomatic incident if an execution of a servant of the king was authorised. He went back to England to escape \\"the furious bite of the cruel and pitiless Roman inquisition\\".Ballerini, Luigi; Barzini, Stefania, ed (2005). The art of cooking: the first modern cookery book, translated by Jeremy Parzen (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press), p. 36 . Travels In 1574 he befriended Sir Roger North of Kirtling on a 1574 visit to England and accompanied his son John on an educational tour in Italy. He was known to travel frequently to Europe after settling in England. He attended the renowned book fairs at Basel and Frankfurt. In 1594 after his wife died he travelled to Scotland, Denmark and then Sweden. In Sweden he acquainted himself with Duke Charles who later became king in 1599. He toured Europe in 1598, visiting France, Switzerland and Germany. He set off on another European tour in search of patronage in 1611 after being freed from the Inquisition. Patronage and tutorship In England he received the patronage of Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Francis Walsingham and Sir Christopher Hatton when he became interested in publishing Renaissance works. He was closely involved with the English embassy in Venice and became friends with Sir Henry Wotton who was ambassador there before Sir Dudley Carleton. In 1592 he was appointed Italian tutor to King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark. He gave James VI a manuscript of his works in August 1592, and another manauscript to the Danish ambassador, Niels Krag in 1593, seeking Danish royal patronage.

He taught Italian at the University of Cambridge for the Spring term in 1613; those he taught included George Stanhope. He is considered to be the most important promoter of the Italian language and heritage after John Florio, the first known teacher of Italian at the University of Oxford.John Martin, ‚ÄòCastelvetro, Giacomo (bap. 1546, d. 1616)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Aug 2009 Works *Explicatio gravissimae quaestionis utrum excommunicatio (1589) Castelvetro edited this work of Thomas Erastus and published his collection of medical works (Varia Opuscula Medica) to which Castelvetro wrote the introduction in 1590. He paid for the publishing of Il pastor fido in England in 1591. * After settling in Venice in 1598 he edited manuscripts on contemporary Italian poetry and fiction for a publisher called G.B Ciotto. * The fruit, herbs & vegetables of Italy (1614) He was apparently shocked by the English partiality for meat, lack of green vegetables and sugar-rich diet. Thus he set about writing The fruit, herbs & vegetables of Italy (1614). The manuscript, written in Italian, was circulated amongst supporters. He was, like many Italians, a keen gardener. At the time in which he was writing the British palate was only beginning to absorb culinary flavours from the continent. Aspects of French and Dutch cooking had assimilated into British cooking but eating habits were still centred on the consumption of large quantities of meat. Castelvetro's enthusiasm for a diverse diet preceded John Evelyn's treatise produced in 1699 which equally urged the English to eat more salad vegetables.

Origin Type 7103 DSRV was intended to rescue sailors trapped in submarine lost at the sea, and when the decision was made to develop a DSRV, the project number 7103 was given, and subsequently was also used to indicate the type designation. It was jointly developed by a team that included the 701st Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Harbin Shipbuilding Engineering Institute (HSEI, later reorganized as Harbin Engineering University), Huazhong Institute of Technology (HIT, later reorganized as Huazhong University of Science and Technology), and the same builder of the Osprey class submersibles in Chinese service, Wuchang Shipbuilding Factory (later reorganized to Wuhan Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, Inc.) Type 7103 DSRV is the first manned submersible in China. Developmental history In April, 1971, the then 34-year-old assistant professor Zhu Jimao (Êú±ÁªßÊáã,February, 1932 -) of HSEI was named by the 6th Ministry as the chief designer of Type 7103 DSRV. A 1954 Shanghai Jiaotong University graduate, Professor Zhu was in charge of some of the tests of Type 091 submarine, the first Chinese nuclear submarine in the 1960s, and had successfully developed some subsystems used on the SSN, such as the underwater autopilot, reverse thruster controlling system, and resistance measuring system. In his work, Professor Zhu has suggested a new experimental methodology of determining the shape of the submarine that would minimize the drag by based on the theory of wave drag with the peak of the transverse wave that has low Fr value, and this resulted in the successful completion of the water tank used for testing. Due to his past success and achievement, Professor Zhu was assigned as the general designer of Type 7103 DSRV at young age, and he immediately joined his colleagues in a small test facilities on the bank of Lake Tai, sacrificing his personal life, as with the rest of the team. For example, Professor Zhu did not see his daughter for more than a year after she was born. Also in April, 1971, a joint team was set up at Wuhan Shipbuilding Factory, with the 701st Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation as the general design team and HSEI as the deputy general design team. China had never developed anything similar before and at the beginning, many suggested to take the prudent approach by repeating the common foreign practice of developing four generations submersibles, i.e. 1st, developing an observatory submersible, and then the 2nd, a submersible capable of working underwater, while the 3rd would be a submersible enabling divers to enter and exit underwater. Finally, the 4th generation would be the DSRV capable of performing underwater rescue operations. Professor Zhu felt that China does not have much time and thus could not spent too much time repeating the foreign experience. Instead, China must develop its own way and thus should directly jump into developing the fourth generation DSRV, despite technological difficulties. After consulting with all experts on the team, a scaled-down radio operated remotely controlled model was used in experiments such as mating operations, as opposed to the common practice of building 1:1 scaled model like the way US did it, and the result was tens of millions of Chinese dollars saved, while the time needed was much shortened. Meanwhile, the methodology Professor Zhu developed for Type 7103 DSRV development, titled ‚ÄúAnalysis Methodology of Density in the Designs of Deep Diving Submersibles‚Äù had since become the standard text for future Chinese submersible designers. In 1972, another scholar, Xu Yuru (ÂæêÁéâÂ¶Ç) joined the design team of Type 7103 DSRV. Xu is also a professor of Harbin Engineering University, and an expert in fluid dynamic, and he was first put in charge of building the scaled model of Type 7103 DSRV for simulation. The team, as well as the entire 7103 project, soon ran into difficulties when after three years of experiments, a little progress was made. Some of the team members were reassigned, while others eventually immigrated abroad, but Professor Xu stayed, and believed that there would be success when the correct methodologies were used. After overcame difficulties such as inadequate funding and primitive equipment, as well as his own health problem of having peptic ulcer which resulted in half of his stomach being removed in surgery, Professor Xu eventually succeeded, obtaining sixty-seven important fluid dynamic parameters of Type 7103 DSRV, while at the same time completing the associating planar motion system used in the research, the first of its kind in China. Construction of Type 7103 DSRV begun in 1976 at Wuhan Shipbuilding Factory, and in January, 1980, it was launched simultaneously with its mother ship, Type 925 Dajiang class submarine rescue ship / salvage ship (ASR/ARS). The 1st stage of sea trials lasted from October, 1984 through August, 1983, with three objectives totaling forty-one trials. Test results from these trials revealed several issues that needs to be addressed, including the need to improve search, guidance and observatory capabilities, the need to improve the reliability of onboard subsystems, particularly that of the reverse thruster and the silver‚Äìzinc batteries, and the need to improve the mating system of the skirt. Round-the-clock work was immediately begun on solving these problems. After the intensive work, the upgraded sample was ready for the next stage of trials. The 2nd stage of trials begun in 1985, and in May, 1985, sea trials was conducted in South China Sea under the supervision of Professor Xu Yuru, where three operators succeeded in continuously mating with submarines for three times under different sea states. These tests provided the bases on which the mathematic model and other analysis for Type 7103 DSRV were established. Based on the results of these trials, Professor Xu led the team to design the simulation / testing water tank, and also conducted further tests on models in Songhua River. The experience gained was instrumental in successfully developing a four-degree of freedom (DOF) dynamic positioning system needed for Type 7103 DSRV. From April 1986 through June 1986, tests were conducted for three functions including deep diving, wet and dry rescues. On June 3, 1986, under the command of the general designer Zhu Jimao, Type 7103 DSRV mated with a submarine and transferred seven crew members of the submarine to DSRV in less than three minutes during a dry rescue mission. This success has the Chinese being the second country in the world to achieve successful underwater mating between a DSRV and a submarine, after the United States. In the meantime, Type 7103 also completed wet rescue tests, and achieved the deepest diving record of Chinese submarine when it dived 360 meters below the surface. Design and structure Shanghai 3rd Steel Factory (‰∏äÈí¢‰∏âÂéÇ) and Shanghai 8th Steel Factory (‰∏äÈí¢ÂÖ´ÂéÇ) teamed up to jointly develop Type 402 steel used to construct the pressure hull of Type 7103 DSRV, while Type 840-S welding stick of 3Ni ‚Äì Mn ‚Äì Cr ‚Äì Mo series was also developed for welding of the pressure hull. HSEI developed the positioning and integrated display systems for rescue operations in fast flowing ocean currents with low visibility, and the system was the first of its type in China, and subsequently adopted for other applications in Chinese oceanic exploration. After the conclusion of the first stage of the trials at the sea, it was obvious that operating the DSRV in such complex submarine rescue operations could not be conducted manually alone, but instead, automation was not only needed, but it was also a must. Harbin Engineering University professor Bian Xinqian (Ëæπ‰ø°Èªî), who was among the first exchange scholars China sent abroad in the early 1980s to study computer systems, PCs in particular, recommended and subsequently lead a team to develop a new computer system for Type 7103 DSRV, because the computer system China had back then was simply too bulky to be fit into Type 7103 DSRV and a brand new system was needed. This was a considerable challenge for Chinese considering that the first miniature computer IBM PC had just appeared several years before and China had nothing similar at the time. Under the leadership of Professor Bian Xinqian, the team succeeded in successfully developing a mini/micro computer system during a short span of time, and adopted the system for use on Type 7103 DSRV. This computer system won national award in 1985, even before the completion of Type 7103 DSRV program. In November 1987, Type 7103 DSRV was formally handed to PLAN. The success of Type 7103 DSRV is viewed by Chinese as a proof of China joining the ranks of those other countries with advanced submarine rescue technologies. For his contribution of pioneering work in Type 7103 DSRV and submarine rescue technological development in China, the general designer, Zhu Jimao, was awarded the rank of full professor in 1984 by the direct order of the State Council of the People's Republic of China before the completion of the project, and in 1990, he was awarded the national title of Mid-aged and Young Experts with Outstanding Contribution, which was one of twenty-one various awards he received since 1977. Professor Zhu Jimao was later named as the general designer of HR-01 ROUV. In 1990, Type 7103 DSRV won first place in the national science and technological advance award, and the design team of one of the main contractor, the then Naval Engineering Institute of Harbin Engineering University, headed by Zhang Yongyao (Âº†ËØµÂ∞ß), was also awarded. The computerized control and command system of Type 7103 was one of the first applications of mini/micro computers in China, and for that pioneering work, this system won the national award in 1985, before the completion of the project. 7103 training submersible As part of #7103 project, training submersibles based on Type 7103 DSRV are also built. The training submersible is similar in size, and differs only slightly in external appearance in comparison to Type 7103 DSRV: the tiny conning tower is absent on the training submersible, but instead, an elevated flat-top ridge in the midsection of the training submersible, which is used to simulate the hatches of regular submarines. The training submersible is used to simulate submarines in distraught, and the DSRV would practice docking with the training submersible and transfer crews in training missions. A total of two training submersibles are built and they can be carried by the same mother ships that carry Type 7103 DSRVs. Service and deployment Type 7103 DSRV is usually carried by Type 925 Dajiang class submarine rescue / salvage ship (ASR/ARS) of PLAN, which also carries the training submersible. A total of 4 Type 7103 DSRVs are built, but in general, only two are readily available at any given time, while this pair is deployed on ships, the other pair would be at base for maintenance and providing secondary shore-based training. Under emergency situations, all four could be readily available for deployment. While at sea, each Type 925 Dajiang class ASR/ARS would only carry one Type 7103 DSRV, while the slot for the second is used to carry the training submersible for training at sea. During rescue missions, the training submersible would be replaced by a second Type 7103 DSRV. Although Type 7103 DSRV and its supporting equipment are designed to be air transportable like the American Mystic class deep submergence rescue vehicle, China lacks the heavy-lifting cargo airplanes such as the Antonov An-124 or C-5 Galaxy for rapid aerial deployment. This air transportable capability is no longer present in the successor of Type 7103 DSRV designed by Harbin Engineering University. Modernization Because Type 7103 DSRV is a design of 1970s, and has a rather limited capability to meet the needs of a 21st-century environment. The 701st Institute and Wuchang Shipbuilding Factory jointly launched a comprehensive modernization program for all Type 7103 DSRVs, which lasted from 1994 through 1996. The most significant upgrade included the installation of an upgraded 4-DOF positioning system, and the installation of a new integrated command, control and display system. The maximum rescue depth is increased by 20% to 360 meters, while some other additional tasks can also be performed at the maximum diving depth. The size of Type 7103 DSRV is slightly increased after its upgrade in the mid 1990s. Despite the upgrade, Type 7103 DSRV has nonetheless limited capability due to its inherent old design of the 1970s. The major limitation is that it cannot dock with submarines which are titled at greater angles. Furthermore, during the docking operation, the maximum speed of the oceanic current must not exceed 1.5 kt and the visibility must be greater than 0.5 meter. Realizing that Type 7103 DSRV has reached its potential and there is not much room for any further significant improvements, Harbin Engineering University has developed a successor of Type 7103 DSRV to overcome these shortcomings. Specifications The dimension of Type 7103 is slightly increased after the 1994‚Äì1996 modernization, though the differences are very minor: *Length: 14.88 meter pre modernization, > 15 meter post modernization *Width: 2.6 meter *Height: 4 meter *Speed: 4 kt *Displacement: 32 ton pre modernization, > 35 ton post modernization *Maximum diving depth: > 600 meter *Maximum rescue depth: 300 meter pre modernization, 360 meter post modernization *Rescue pressures: 5 bar *Crew: 4 (1 or 2 operators, a diver, and a doctor) *Propulsion: Silver‚Äìzinc battery powered *Maximum number of rescued submariners: 22 in docking operation, 6 to 10 in wet rescue operation References Chinese DSRV Category:Submarines of the People's Liberation Army Navy Category:Deep- submergence vehicles Category:Deep-submergence rescue vehicles Category:Lifeboats Category:Crewed submersibles Category:1980 ships ","title":"Type 7103 DSRV"},{"id":"24111857","text":"Georgetown is an unincorporated community in Carroll County, Illinois, United States.

Klauber (c1885) Abraham Klauber (January 24, 1831, in Zdeslav, Bohemia ‚Äì July 23, 1911, in San Diego, California) was the grandson of Rabbi Moses Klauber, and the son of Jacob and Elizabeth Klauber. Abraham's father died of cholera in 1844, leaving 13-year-old Abraham as the sole support for both his mother and younger sister Mary. He immediately went to work for a merchant named Mandlebaum, as a clerk in his grocery. As a young man he learned the merchandising business, but by the time he was nineteen, he had heard the tales of California's gold rush and of freedom in America. In 1850 he left his homeland to make his fortune in the New World.The Sounding, David M. Klauber, Coulter Ridge Press , Julian CA. 92036, 2009, In 1850 from Bremerhaven Germany, Abraham took the sailing ship (Ocean Queen) to New Orleans. On arriving he then took a steamboat to St. Louis, where he went to work for Herman Levi. After a short time he moved on to Ottawa, Illinois, where he worked for Francis Mandlebaum, soon the two men became business partners. In 1852 the two left for New York, setting sail for the gold mines of California via the Isthmus of Nicaragua. The harrowing trip across the Nicaraguan Isthmus was plagued with much sickness and death. It was during the crossing that young Abe contracted yellow fever, which he survived. On arriving in San Francisco in July 1852, Abraham traveled again up river to Sacramento where he and his partner Francis Mandlebaum started a small clothing and general store. Abraham was witness to the great fire and flood of Sacramento on November 2, 1852. After rebuilding their store, Abraham moved to Volcano, California, setting up a branch store called \\"The Sacramento Store, Abraham Klauber & Co.\\" Abraham and Francis married two sisters Louisa and Theresa Epstein who were also originally from Bohemia. Francis and Abraham were joined later in their business enterprises by brothers-in-law Morris and Henry Epstein who would be elected as a state legislator representing Douglas County for the first Organization of the State of Nevada. The store in Volcano did very well during the Gold Rush, and soon Abraham opened another group of stores over the Sierra in Genoa Nevada Territory. The Genoa store was to play a key role in the history of Nevada. During his years in Nevada (1859‚Äì1868) he opened branch stores in Dayton, Carson City and Virginia City Nevada. Abraham provided his stores with goods by trucking supplies via mule train and wagon across the Sierra Mountains. Abraham's store in Genoa was used by Wells Fargo to conduct its business. The company's agents, Abraham and Henry Epstein, also became local agents for the Pony Express. The Pony Express was an important link with the outside world. It was a lifeline of information for the local papers that brought in the latest news and reports on the festering slave question in the East. The communications were even more important during this period since the country was leading up to the start of the Civil War. Abraham became a U.S. Citizen on March 12, 1859, using money he had earned from his business enterprises, he soon sent for both his mother and sister in Bohemia. After having three children, Abraham began to tire of the hard mountain life, the Comstock mines had begun to slow production and the establishment of the transcontinental railroad began to negatively affect his Nevada Business. Abraham soon began to look for another place to live. In 1869, he chose San Diego as the place where he would move his enterprises. It was in San Diego where he created his new business in an area called \\"New Town,\\" purchasing a lot from the \\"Father of San Diego\\" Alonzo Horton. For the next 40 years he would grow both his family & business enterprises starting with Steiner & Klauber, Klauber & Levi and then finally the very successful wholesale food distribution firm of Klauber Wangenheim Co. Abraham and Theresa would raise 9 of their 12 children to adults. Abraham's youngest son Laurence Monroe Klauber (1883 in San Diego, California ‚Äì 1968), was an American herpetologist, and was considered to be the foremost authority on rattlesnakes. In 1877, Abraham ran for and was elected with 756 votes to serve with D.R. Foss and E. Ormsby on San Diego's Board of Supervisors, serving as its chairman 1878‚Äì80. The much revered 80-year-old pioneer and adventurer passed to his final rest on July 23, 1911. Acquaintances declared that his death marked the passing of one of the gentlest and most loved characters the southland had ever known. There is still a Klauber Avenue to the southeast of City Heights, the neighborhood Klauber was instrumental in founding. In City Heights itself, Klauber Street was renamed to Wightman,http://www.efgh.com/np/sidewalks.htm but the old name can still be seen engraved in the sidewalk in some places, as it is a custom in San Diego to preserve the original markings when repaving the sidewalks. Klauber/Wightman St. is one block south of University Ave, which was originally named after Klauber's partner Steiner.Decisions of the Railroad Commission of the State of California, Volume 4, p. 397  References  Category:1831 births Category:1911 deaths Category:19th-century Czech people Category:1860s in the United States Category:People of the California Gold Rush Category:People of the American Old West Category:Wells Fargo Category:Nevada Territory Category:Czech Jews Category:Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Czech-Jewish descent Category:Bohemian people Category:People from San Diego ","title":"Abraham Klauber"},{"id":"24111875","text":"P√°dhraic √ì Com√°in (fl. 1878) was an Irish scribe. √ì Com√°in was from Pairce O Cuaman, Creig Mh√≥ir, Leacach (Lackagh, County Galway).

It is part of the South Madison Community School Corporation and has an enrollment of around 1,400 students. History Pendleton Heights was built in 1969 as a consolidation of Adams Township's Markleville High School and Fall Creek Township's Pendleton High School. The consolidation happened after the Indiana State Legislature passed the School Reorganization Act, causing the redistricting of school boundaries so that each student was backed by $5,000 in assessed tax evaluation. Under this Act, Markleville High school no longer qualified as a public high school. In 1959, a nine-man school reorganization committee was appointed to redistrict the school systems of Madison County. After much discussion and many public meetings throughout the county a plan was devised that met all requirements. In southern Madison County, the new school district consisted of Green, Fall Creek and Adams Townships. The area chosen to build the new consolidated school consisted of approximately just east of Pendleton, bordering State Road 67 and State Road 38. Central location of this site to the schools was considered in the selection. The property was sold to the school in early 1967 with construction on the new high school starting in October of that year. The original building was completed for occupancy September 1, 1969, with the first graduating class in 1970. The school began construction on the school in 1996 with a remodeling and renovation project. The project; which consisted of a new academic wing and media center, a 900-seat auditorium and performing arts center, and an auxiliary gymnasium; was completed in Spring 1999. In Spring 2009, the 10 year anniversary of the renovation was celebrated with the \\"Loran G.

It was released on November 30, 2010 in North America, and December 1 in the PAL region, on PlayStation Network. Dead Nation takes place in a world afflicted by a zombie apocalypse. The player can play as a male or female character and fight different types of zombies. Dead Nation was one of the games given by Sony as part of their 'Welcome Back' package because of the PlayStation Network outage. In February 2014 a PlayStation 4 version of the game titled the Apocalypse Edition was announced along with the PlayStation Vita version. The original Road of Devastation downloadable content was included for the PS3 and Vita versions, and the PS4 version was free for PlayStation Plus subscribers in March 2014. The PS4 and Vita versions were ported to Japan for release on May 29, 2014. Gameplay Players are awarded score multipliers and money when zombies are killed. Money is used to purchase and upgrade weapons at checkpoints, and multipliers to grant better scores. Each time players are hit, they lose multipliers and health. Players fight their way through ten levels, using weapon shops that allow weapon upgrading and armor swapping. Throughout the levels, players can find boxes that hold ammunition, multipliers, money, or armor pieces, and also loot cars and trunks for money. If a car is blown up before being looted, though, the loot is lost. At times the players are trapped in areas where they must survive until they have accomplished a certain goal (e.g. wait for an elevator while fighting zombies or kill all zombies in the area). Armor sets influence strength, endurance and agility. Zombies are attracted by flares, car alarms, grenades, mines, and vending machines. Zombies can be killed by environmental hazards which the player can use to their advantage. Players can encounter a variety of zombies. Players can use a melee and rush attack against zombies, as well as a variety of weaponry. The metagame allows players to follow their country's progress in relation to other countries, as well as local leaderboards. Using the PlayStation Network, players are grouped with other players from their country. When a country is rid of zombies, a new infection cycle begins. Multiplayer can be done locally or online for two players. Plot Society has collapsed and most of the world's population have become zombies due to a virus outbreak. A year later, the protagonists (either Jack McReady, Scarlett Blake or both when played in co-op mode) are preparing to leave their shelter in search of food and water. They are immune to the current strain of the virus. After reaching a gas station, they pick up a radio transmission, but it is just static. They head to a police station, in search for a means to strengthen the radio signal, but find out they need to get to higher ground to do so. After picking up the transmission, they are contacted by a Doctor Morton, who tells them he works for Egogate Pharmacy company, and that he is developing a cure, but need two things: a sample of their DNA and a tissue sample from Patient Zero, named Douglas Bane, the first human being to be infected; he then directs them to Marrow hospital, through the edge of the city. They fight their way through infested streets and, at the hospital, they find out that the body was buried in a nearby graveyard. It is revealed that the body was moved to the harbor docks via train. However, the body was moved again to Raven's Field Airport, north of the harbor, so they head there and, after collecting Bane's head, they fly using an abandoned helicopter to the underground facility, where they are welcomed by the doctor and told that they will be injected with a serum to be synthesized by their bodies and they will be living sources of the cure. However, they are to be turned into biological weapons, controlled by the company to do their bidding. Realizing that they have nothing to lose, and there is no way out, they bite a cyanide capsule they have implanted inside their molar, in case they are overwhelmed by zombies, to prevent enduring the pain of being eaten alive. As the doctor notes that they are dying, he rushes to see what is happening, but the zombie virus has mutated and they have been infected, turning into zombies right after the capsule is opened. Their first kill is the doctor. Assuming the first person nature of the narrative, it is implied that they have become sentient zombies. Reception The PlayStation 3 version of Dead Nation received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PlayStation 4 and Vita versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game engine was noted for supporting large numbers of zombies on screen as well as impressive lighting effects. In 2013, the PS3 version was included in IGN's Top 25 PlayStation Network Games, at position 12. Updates Dead Nation lacked online voice chat upon release, but an update released on March 10, 2011 added this feature. The update also included laser sight upgrades for guns and display improvements including visual indications when the rush meter fills and when players take damage. Road of Devastation A DLC expansion called Road of Devastation was released in September 2011 for the PS3, and in April 2014 for the PlayStation Vita. The pack focuses on continuous survival, and presents players with upgrade paths instead of stages. Each round ends by returning to a laboratory, where the player receives prizes for their achievements before starting the next round. There are three main paths, each of which splits into two sub-paths. Once a round is completed, the player cannot re-enter the same path in the following round. Gameplay has been altered slightly compared to the main game. When a player in co-op mode opens a box with money, the amount acquired is only given to the player that opened the box. Zombie strength, health and speed increase with each round. The game ends when the player dies, forcing them to restart from the beginning. A patch added an arcade mode to the DLC, where progress can be saved between rounds, but players are limited to play until Round 6, and the original mode now is called \\"Endless\\". Reception The PS3 version of the Road of Devastation DLC received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic.

Alishan National Scenic Area covers most, but not all, of the township and also parts of neighboring townships. History Alishan is traditional territory of the headhunting Tsou people, whose rich oral histories describe the migrations of each ancient clans' ancestors into the area between Yushan and the Chianan Plain. Originally, each clan had its own settlement, with the first multi-clan town, Tfuya, only forming approximately 1600 CE. The earliest written record of the Tsou dates from the Dutch occupation, which describes Tfuya as having approximately 300 people in 1647. Ethnologists have attempted to reconstruct the development of Tfuya, proposing that each stage of clan migration could be equivalent to three or four generations of family. Map of Alishan area (1944) The Alishan area was originally settled by the Tsou tribe of the Taiwanese aborigines; the name derives from the aboriginal word Jarissang. From 1920 to 1945, the area was classified as Savage Land under Kagi District, Tainan Prefecture. After 1945, the area was named Wufong Township (Âê≥È≥≥ÈÑâ), after Chinese merchant Wu Feng, but was renamed to Alishan Township in March 1989. Geography It has a population total of 5,631 and an area of 427.8471 square kilometres. It is located at an elevation of in the western highlands of Taiwan. Climate Alishan has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb) with extremely wet and mild conditions during the monsoon season when the town receives of rain in five months, and cool and drier conditions during the winter months. Temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year, with only noticeably cooler temperatures during the winter months of December to February of the following year. When typhoons hit Taiwan during the wet season, rainfall in highland locations like Alishan can exceed per day, which is the heaviest rainfall in the Northern Hemisphere and exceeded only in a few oceanic islands of the Southern Hemisphere such as R√©union. Administrative divisions Administrative divisions of Alishan Township The township comprises 12 villages: Chashan, Dabang, Fongshan, Laiji, Leye, Lijia, Shanmei, Shihzih, Sianglin, Sinmei, Jhongshan and Jhongjheng. Tourist attractions Alishan is the main base for trekkers in the highlands of Taiwan and for mountain climbers aiming to scale Yu Shan, Taiwan's highest peak and the highest and sole formerly glaciatedLate Pleistocene to early Holocene glacial landforms of Yushan point on the Tropic of Cancer. Chu Shan, though lower, is more accessible and climbed by most visitors to the region, which is extremely popular with Taiwanese tourists. The highland region in which Alishan is situated also contains a number of notable rock formations from the continuing uplift of the island. Jiao Lung Waterfall, Taiwan's tallest waterfall, is located within the township. YuYuPas Tsou cultural tribe park showcases the culture of the Tsou.

Louisiana Public Service Commission, 539 U.S. 39 (2003), is a Supreme Court of the United States case holding that a federal administrative agency approved public utility tariff preempted a state public utilities commission rate order under the filed rate doctrine.. Background Entergy, a multistate holding company, allocated the costs of its electric generating capacity, including capacity held in extended reserve shutdown, among its five public utilities that it owned pursuant to a tariff schedule MSS-1 approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The tariff delegated discretion to Entergy to determine the specific cost allocations. The resulting costs, which changed monthly, were then assigned under the Entergy System Operating Agreement to each of the five public utilities under an automatic adjustment clause in the tariff, so FERC review and approval of a specific cost allocation was not required. In May 1997 Entergy Louisiana, Inc., one of the five public utilities, filed its annual retail electric rate case with the Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC). The PSC issued an order disallowing the costs associated with the electric generating units in extended shutdown reserve from being recovered in rates. The PSC concluded that since FERC had never determined that the allocation of costs as determined by Entergy was consistent with the Entergy System Operating Agreement, it could make this prudency decision without violating the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. As a result of this decision, Entergy Louisiana was required to pay the allocated costs of the extended shutdown reserve generation but could not recover these costs in its retail electric rates. Entergy Louisiana appealed the PSC order to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. The state court upheld the PSC order as not being barred by federal preemption because the PSC was not attempting to regulate interstate wholesale electric rates. The court also noted that FERC never ruled on the issue of whether Entergy Louisiana's decision to include the extended shutdown reserve generating units was a prudent one or whether to include these costs in rates was mandatory. Opinion of the Court The U.S. Supreme Court stated that it granted certiorari to determine whether its filed rate doctrine holdings in Nantahala Power and Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953 (1986), and Mississippi Power and Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354 (1988), would lead to federal preemption of the Louisiana PSC order. The filed rate doctrine is an American administrative law rule that a court should not permit a collateral attack on a tariffed rate of a public utility that was determined by an agency, and that any litigation regarding the validity of that rate must be conducted before that agency. With the Supremacy Clause, any tariffed rate approved by a federal agency must be given effect by a state public utility commission that regulates a public utility and sets intrastate rates. Nantahala held that cost allocations related to a FERC approved power agreement must be followed by state agencies in setting public utility rates. In Mississippi Power, FERC had allocated the costs of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station among various public utility companies. The Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled that the state PSC could consider the prudence of the Grand Gulf costs allocated to a public utility since FERC had never ruled on the prudency of these costs. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, stating that FERC orders must be given preemptive effect regardless of whether a particular matter had been litigated and decided by FERC. Applying the Nantahala and Mississippi Power holdings to the Louisiana case, the Court noted that the PSC order impermissibly had the effect of trapping generation costs with the public utility by excluding them from recovery in rates. Although the Entergy System Operating Agreement differed from the tariffs in the Nantahala and Mississippi Power cases in that it left the classification of reserve generating units to an operating committee, this delegated discretion did not allow the PSC room for a finding of imprudence where a FERC mandated cost allocation would not. As Congress had permitted the use of automatic adjustment clauses in the Federal Power Act,Federal Power Act, . the Court decided the MSS-1 schedule constituted such a clause. The Court then determined that there was no reason to create an exception to the filed rate doctrine for tariffs using this type of clause. The U.S. Supreme Court also stated that the Louisiana Supreme Court ruling regarding the ability of the PSC to conduct prudency reviews was the same erroneous reasoning advanced by the Mississippi Supreme Court in the Mississippi Power case. The Court explained that it did not matter whether FERC had specifically ruled on the reserve generating units, but only whether the FERC approved tariff dictated how and by whom that classification should be made. For these reasons, the decision of the state court was reversed. See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 539 * Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper Inc. * United States v.

History The site was once a prehistoric village for the Monongahela and is just one of several village sites located throughout Ohio. Located on a high hilltop with an elevation of , the site is located between the headwaters of two prominent creeks, it provided an excellent site for habitation. The village encompassed around 2-3 acres of land with huts, refuse pits and burial features ringing a central plaza devoid of any structure. The site has yielded the human remains of 3 separate natives, two female and one male. Early local residents claimed the site as a burial ground due to a large amount of human remains found when a county road was laid out through the middle of the village site. The eastern side of the site has not been investigated as permission has been repeatedly refused by the landowner. The site was abandoned sometime around 1500 AD for unknown reasons. The Tower Site in September 2012. Current Condition The location was fenced off to keep trespassers out and also to mark the village bounds from the local mining operations. The location also houses a radio relay tower, which lends its name to the site. The site was severely \\"potholed\\" (cylindrical sections are dug up and sifted, compared to a large square excavation), revealing pottery shards, bone fragments, arrow heads and beads. The many finds brought attention to the site as it was discovered to be a village instead of just a burial ground. Several excavations during the late 1970s by Kent State University's archaeological department further discovered hundreds of animal bone fragments, pottery shards, arrow heads, cannel coal pendants, shells, beads, as well as a burial pit containing a female skeleton. The coal company completed most operations in the area of the Tower Site, leaving the site comparatively quiet. The fence has recently been removed as the site is under ongoing surveillance to protect it from vandals.

One Englishman was a member of the Company of Scotland and signatory to the Act, and certainly under modern rules would be deemed to have an unacceptable personal interest and motive in the Act: *John Smith (Chancellor of the Exchequer) History of the Poem \\"Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation\\" was written by Scotland's National poet Robert Burns in 1791.Burns Country He decried those members of the Parliament of Scotland who signed the Act of Union with England in 1707. Burns contrasted their supposed treachery to the country with the tradition of martial valour and resistance commonly associated with such historic figures as Robert the Bruce and William Wallace. The poet states that he wishes to have lain in the grave with Bruce or Wallace, than have seen this treacherous sale of Scotland in his lifetime. The melody and lyrics were published in volume 1 of James Hogg's Jacobite Reliques of 1819 (no. 36). Recordings The song was revived in the 20th century by Ewan MacColl, whose recording of it can be found on the collection The Real MacColl. Steeleye Span later included it under the name Rogues in a Nation on their album Parcel of Rogues, and it has been covered by numerous other musicians, including The Corries, Alastair McDonald, Jean Redpath, The Dubliners (Luke Kelly), Dick Gaughan, Makem and Clancy, Hamish Imlach, Old Blind Dogs, Jesse Ferguson--The Bard of Cornwall and Heelster Gowdie. A spoken word version was recorded by Bill Drummond of The KLF as the closer of his solo album The Man (1986). Lyrics The song's lyrics are in Lowlands Scots. :Fareweel to a' our Scottish fame, :Fareweel our ancient glory; :Fareweel ev'n to the Scottish name, :Sae fam'd in martial story. :Now Sark rins over Solway sands, :An' Tweed rins to the ocean, :To mark where England's province stands- :Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! :What force or guile could not subdue, :Thro' many warlike ages, :Is wrought now by a coward few, :For hireling traitor's wages. :The English steel we could disdain, :Secure in valour's station; :But English gold has been our bane - :Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! :O would, ere I had seen the day :That Treason thus could sell us, :My auld grey head had lien in clay, :Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace! :But pith and power, till my last hour, :I'll mak this declaration; :We're bought and sold for English gold- :Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!The Jacobite Relics of Scotland References External links *Digitised copy of volumes 1 and 2 of The Relics of Jacobite Scotland by James Hogg, printed between 1819 and 1821, from National Library of Scotland.

Specifically, properties that clients can prove using the specification of an object's presumed type should hold even though the object is actually a member of a subtype of that type. For example, consider a type Stack and a type Queue, that both have a put method to add an element and a get method to remove one. Suppose the documentation associated with these types specifies that type Stack's methods shall behave as expected for stacks (i.e. they shall exhibit LIFO behavior), and that type Queue's methods shall behave as expected for queues (i.e. they shall exhibit FIFO behavior). Suppose, now, that type Stack were declared as a subclass of type Queue. Most programming language compilers ignore documentation and perform only the checks that are necessary to preserve type safety. Since, for each method of type Queue, type Stack provides a method with a matching name and signature, this check would succeed. However, clients accessing a Stack object through a reference of type Queue would, based on Queue's documentation, expect FIFO behavior but observe LIFO behavior, invalidating these clients' correctness proofs and potentially leading to incorrect behavior of the program as a whole. This example violates behavioral subtyping because type Stack is not a behavioral subtype of type Queue: it is not the case that the behaviors allowed by Stack are also allowed by Queue. In contrast, a program where both Stack and Queue are subclasses of a type Bag, whose specification for get is merely that it removes some element, does satisfy behavioral subtyping and allows clients to safely reason about correctness based on the presumed types of the objects they interact with. Indeed, any object that satisfies the Stack or Queue specification also satisfies the Bag specification. It is important to stress that whether a type S is a behavioral subtype of a type T depends only on the specification of type T; the implementation of type T, if it has any, is completely irrelevant to this question. Indeed, type T need not even have an implementation; it might be a purely abstract class. As another case in point, type Stack above is a behavioral subtype of type Bag even if type Bag's implementation exhibits FIFO behavior: what matters is that type Bag's specification does not specify which element is removed by method get. This also means that behavioral subtyping can be discussed only with respect to a particular (behavioral) specification for each type involved, and that if the types involved have no well-defined behavioral specification, behavioral subtyping cannot be discussed meaningfully. Verifying behavioral subtyping A type S is a behavioral subtype of a type T if each behavior allowed by the specification of S is also allowed by the specification of T. This requires, in particular, that for each method M of T, the specification of M in S is stronger than the one in T. A method specification given by a precondition Ps and a postcondition Qs is stronger than one given by a precondition Pt and a postcondition Qt (formally: (Ps, Qs) ‚áí (Pt, Qt)) if Ps is weaker than Pt (i.e. Pt implies Ps) and Qs is stronger than Qt (i.e. Qs implies Qt). That is, strengthening a method specification can be done by strengthening the postcondition and by weakening the precondition. Indeed, a method specification is stronger if it imposes more specific constraints on the outputs for inputs that were already supported, or if it requires more inputs to be supported. For example, consider the (very weak) specification for a method that computes the absolute value of an argument x, that specifies a precondition 0 ‚â§ x and a postcondition 0 ‚â§ result. This specification says the method need not support negative values for x, and it need only ensure the result is nonnegative as well. Two possible ways to strengthen this specification are by strengthening the postcondition to state result = |x|, i.e. the result is equal to the absolute value of x, or by weakening the precondition to \\"true\\", i.e. all values for x should be supported. Of course, we can also combine both, into a specification that states that the result should equal the absolute value of x, for any value of x. Note, however, that it is possible to strengthen a specification ((Ps, Qs) ‚áí (Pt, Qt)) without strengthening the postcondition (Qs ‚áè Qt). Consider a specification for the absolute value method that specifies a precondition 0 ‚â§ x and a postcondition result = x. The specification that specifies a precondition \\"true\\" and a postcondition result = |xstrengthens this specification, even though the postcondition result = |xdoes not strengthen (or weaken) the postcondition result = x. The necessary condition for a specification with precondition Ps and postcondition Qs to be stronger than a specification with precondition Pt and postcondition Qt is that Ps is weaker than Pt and \\"Qs or not Ps\\" is stronger than \\"Qt or not Pt\\". Indeed, \\"result = |xor false\\" does strengthen \\"result = x or x < 0\\". \\"Substitutability\\" In an influential keynote address on data abstraction and class hierarchies at the OOPSLA 1987 programming language research conference, Barbara Liskov said the following: \\"What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property: If for each object o_1 of type S there is an object o_2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o_1 is substituted for o_2, then S is a subtype of T.\\" This characterisation has since been widely known as the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). Unfortunately, though, it has several issues. Firstly, in its original formulation, it is too strong: we rarely want the behavior of a subclass to be identical to that of its superclass; substituting a subclass object for a superclass object is often done with the intent to change the program's behavior, albeit, if behavioral subtyping is respected, in a way that maintains the program's desirable properties. Secondly, it makes no mention of specifications, so it invites an incorrect reading where the implementation of type S is compared to the implementation of type T. This is problematic for several reasons, one being that it does not support the common case where T is abstract and has no implementation. Thirdly, and most subtly, in the context of object-oriented imperative programming it is difficult to define precisely what it means to universally or existentially quantify over objects of a given type, or to substitute one object for another. In the example above, we are not substituting a Stack object for a Bag object, we are simply using a Stack object as a Bag object. In an interview in 2016, Liskov herself explains that what she presented in her keynote address was an \\"informal rule\\", that Jeannette Wing later proposed that they \\"try to figure out precisely what this means\\", which led to their joint publication on behavioral subtyping, and indeed that \\"technically, it's called behavioral subtyping\\". During the interview, she does not use substitution terminology to discuss the concepts.

Founded in 1998 (after working together under various names including \\"Crown of Thorns\\", \\"Guernica\\", \\"Micronism\\", and others) by musicians Garrick Antikajian and Chris Roy, the band primarily works as a studio-based duo with Antikajian and Roy handling all writing, performance, and production duties, with additional musicians added to the lineup for live performances. History Antikajian and Roy first met as junior high school students, originally recording 4-track cassette portastudio demos in Eugene, Oregon and Junction City, Oregon as \\"Crown of Thorns\\" and later, \\"Guernica\\". Performing regionally at such venues as Portland, Oregon's X-Ray Cafe and Eugene, Oregon's W.O.W. Hall throughout their high school and college years, the duo recorded at Antikajian's 16-track home studio, releasing several demos and a self-released cassette, \\"Multichrome Universe\\", before Antikajian's departure, due to creative differences, in 1992. Roy and the remaining members of \\"Guernica\\" moved to Seattle, Washington in 1993, where the band performed a single show before breaking up. Following the breakup of \\"Guernica\\", Antikajian and Roy began to correspond, mailing demo tapes of their respective solo material between Roy's home in Seattle, Washington and Antikajian's project studio in Rancho Cucamonga, California, resulting in Antikajian's eventual move to Seattle to collaborate on new material. Eventually settling on the name \\"Doll Factory\\", the duo recorded the self-released \\"Premonition EP\\" in 1999, resulting in several compilation album and remix appearances, and attracting the attention of Neue √Ñsthetik Multimedia, an independent record label known for releases from Faith and the Muse, Jane Jensen (musician), and Das Ich. Releasing \\"Weightless\\" in 2003, Doll Factory parted ways with Neue √Ñsthetik after the label fell victim to changes in the music industry - particularly the bankruptcy proceedings of Tower Records and their subsidiary, Bayside Distribution, who held the majority of existing copies of \\"Weightless\\" at the time. After a hiatus while Antikajian was living in New York City, the band began work on a new release, tentatively expected to be released in 2010. Musical style Called a \\"mix of Industrial rock, goth, electronica, and a slight touch of experimentalism\\" and \\"industrial rock with creative electronics\\" with \\"an electroclash-ish edge\\" in magazine reviews of \\"Weightless\\", the band claims to be moving toward a sound that is \\"more new wave, post punk, or indie electronic rock and not so specifically goth or industrial\\", citing \\"current favorites such as The Faint, Interpol, Editors, Muse, Alpinestars, LCD Soundsystem, Ladytron, Fischerspooner, orchestral music, and Eastern-influenced artists like Niyaz, Silk Road Ensemble, Talvin Singh, Natacha Atlas, and Bollywood film soundtracks\\".

She has exhibited internationally since 1981. Working across mediums she is a leading practitioner in the field of photo-conceptualism and is known as an installation artist who uses photography, drawing, and collage. She is one of Canada's most acclaimed contemporary artists and has been recognized in Japan, Korea, Europe, New Zealand and the United States. Her work includes mirrors, photographic landscape murals, postcards collected on her travels plus her own photography and video. Background Alexander was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and is a graduate of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Alexander received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1979 from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax. She is known for her large scale photo- mural installations and multimedia works that combine photography with sculptural objects. These works foreground a strong interest in the history of architecture, the fields of design and fashion supported by the production of drawing and collage. Alexander's use of modernist architecture and industrial design have explored issues of artifice and representation. Her early work informed the movement of Appropriation art in the early 1980s for which she is historically recognized as the youngest innovator of the tendency alongside Richard Prince, Louise Lawler, Barbara Kruger and Sherrie Levine. Alexander's more recent body of work uses collage and digital transfer technology onto printed canvas. Since 1992 Alexander has been professor of photography in the Visual Arts Department at the University of Victoria in Canada. Alexander has exhibited internationally in solo exhibitions including \\"CEPA\\", Buffalo 1983, New Museum, New York City 1985, Kunsthalle Bern, Bern 1990, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver 1992, Mercer Union, Toronto 1993, Presentation House Gallery, Vancouver 1996, Art Gallery of Windsor, Windsor 1998, Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver 1999, Catriona Jeffries Gallery, Vancouver, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa 2000, State Gallery, Vancouver 2004, Trepanier Baer Gallery, Calgary 2009, Massey University, Wellington 2010. She has participated in numerous group exhibitions: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Dia Art Foundation, New York, Yokohama Civic Art Gallery, Yokohama, Barbican Art Gallery, London, Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Seattle Art Museum, Seattle. She was also included in the comprehensive exhibition Intertidal of Vancouver School artists held at MuHKA in Antwerp in 2004. This exhibition drew attention to her influence over two prominent movements in contemporary art production, one in New York and the other in Vancouver. An earlier body of work anticipated Appropriation art while her later artworks deepened the language of Photo-conceptualism, which became the larger tendency of the Vancouver School internationally. Collections of her work can be found in the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the International Center of Photography in New York City, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the Deste Foundation, Athens. Alexander is represented by Trepanier Baer Gallery, Calgary, Wilding Cran, Los Angeles, Cooper Cole, Toronto and Downs & Ross, New York. Press The Vancouver School artist and writer Ian Wallace relates how her work is \\"an expression of the imaginary, wherein fantasies of hope and utopia are acted out in the daydreams that call reality into question. These are collective fantasies and are linked to popular taste for images that transcend the everyday. The images of extreme beauty, which are ubiquitous in commodity culture, function as a cult of escape from the everyday. While the aspiration of much conceptual art has been to present critical images that contradict and shatter these fantasies with the force of reality, Vikky Alexander‚Äôs work projects the raw indulgence that exists on the inside of these fantasies, heightening our apprehension and anxieties of them from within.\\" Wallace, Ian. \\"Review.\\" CAG Catalogue, 1999. Conceptual artist and critic Dan Graham has remarked on the context of design in her work and its relationship to audiences in the 1980s. ‚ÄúTwo-dimensional design can be used to reflect corporate identity, social/political identity and individual identity. Examples of graphic markers of individual identity (which often serve to correlate that identity to corporate or social/political interests) are personalized T-shirts, personal stationery and business cards, greeting cards and the like. (T-shirts imprinted with logotypes are a good example of either corporate or social identities being used by individuals as a sign of individual identity.) These ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù items mark an ‚Äúindividual‚Äù identity that is socially prescribed by convention and commercial systems of exchange. Recently, such artists as Louise Lawler, Kim Gordon, Michael Asher and Vikky Alexander have designed cards, interiors and matches for individual clients. These ‚Äúproducts‚Äù are neither part of commercial mass production nor designed for gallery exhibition and sale as art objects. They set up a peculiar and ambivalent relation between artist and client . . . Thus the kind of designer- client relationship that is constructed inherently questions values of both ‚Äúdesign‚Äù and art receivership, in psychological as well as social/esthetic terms.‚ÄùGraham, Dan. \\"Review.\\" Artforum. 19 no. 8 April 1981. The American curator Dan Cameron is quoted reviewing a large scale installation work titled Lake in the Woods from 1986: ‚ÄúVikky Alexander‚Äôs narrow gallery environment consisting of an idyllic photo-mural diptych, which faces a large prefabricated wall unit, this in turn supporting a row of mirror panels at shoulder height. Only by standing at either end of the room could one take in the entire piece: nature as decorative artifice, figment of a universally synthetic consciousness.‚ÄùCameron, Dan. \\"Review.\\" Flash Art.

Francisco spent 2007 with the single-A Dayton Dragons. He hit .268 in 534 at-bats, slugging 25 home runs and driving in 90. Juan was a Midwest League mid-season All-Star and post-season All-Star for the Dragons. Promoted again in 2008, this time to the single-A advanced Sarasota Reds, he again spent the entire season with the same team. In 516 at-bats, he hit .277 with 23 homers and 92 RBI. Francisco earned All- Star status again, for both the mid-season and post-season in the Florida State League. In addition, he was selected to play in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Futures Game. Francisco was named Reds' Minor League Hitter of the Year for 2008. Juan played winter ball for Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter Baseball League. In 40 games for the team, he .360 with 37 RBI, and his 12 home runs set the DWL record for regular season homers by a left-handed hitter. He continued to produce in the playoffs, hitting six more homers and 18 more RBI.http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=464433 His performance earned him the DWL Rookie of the Year accolade. He was added to the 40-man roster on November 20. Originally a switch-hitter, Francisco abandoned hitting right-handed in 2009 to become a full-time lefty. Juan began the year in double-A Carolina. He played in 109 games for the Mudcats, where he hit .281 with 22 home runs and 78 RBI in 437 at-bats. For the third year in a row he earned mid- and post-season All-Star recognition, this time in the Southern League. He was promoted to the triple-A Louisville Bats. He played in 22 games, getting 92 at-bats, and hit .359 with 5 homers and 19 RBI. Juan again earned a promotion, this time to the Cincinnati Reds. Francisco made his debut for the Reds as part of a 3‚Äì1 win over the Houston Astros on September 14, 2009 at Great American Ball Park. Pinch hitting for left fielder Darnell McDonald in the seventh inning, Francisco faced pitcher Jeff Fulchino and struck out in his first Major League at bat. He finished his September call-up batting .429 (9-for-21) with his first career big-league homer and seven RBI.

He headed back to the Gigantes for the 2009‚Äì10 DWL season. He played in 46 games this time, batting .302 with 11 doubles, 11 homers, and 42 RBI. The Gigantes were runners-up in the playoffs, and in 22 games of post-season play he hit 3 home runs with 18 RBI. This performance earned him the title of 2009 DWL Most Valuable Player. Francisco spent 2010 mainly with the Louisville Bats. Ironically, in his best statistical season to date, he was not named to any All-Star roster for the first time in four years. For the Bats, he played in 77 games and hit .286 in 308 at-bats, slugging 18 homers and 59 RBI in his shortened season. He spent the rest of the season with the Reds, and saw action in 36 games.

In 39 games and 152 at-bats, he hit .322 with 8 homers and 30 RBI. They lost in the championship game again, but this time without Francisco, who fouled a pitch off his leg under his right knee on December 10 and missed the rest of the season. He was hospitalized when it became infected and inflamed and the knee had to be drained, but Walt Jocketty, Reds GM, said that it was nothing serious. Despite missing part of the season, Francisco won his second consecutive DWL MVP award. This and his other trips to the DWL playoffs, which are taken very seriously in the Dominican Republic, have given Juan post- season experience which he can bring with him to the big leagues. Francisco made the club out of spring training in 2011 as a backup to Scott Rolen, backup left fielder, and a left-handed bat off the bench. He switched his number from 64 to the more conventional number 25. On September 12, 2011, Francisco hit a home run off Chicago Cubs pitcher Rodrigo L√≥pez that cleared the right field bleachers at Great American Ball Park. It was estimated to have gone 502 feet. It was the second longest home run in Great American Ballpark history behind Adam Dunn's 535 ft home run in 2004.

On April 16, 2013, Francisco had his first career multi- homer game in a 6‚Äì3 win over the Kansas City Royals. On May 8, Francisco hit his first career grand slam against Reds pitcher J. J. Hoover (who he had been traded for). Francisco was designated for assignment by the Braves on May 30 to make room on the roster for Alex Wood.

Milwaukee Brewers On June 3, 2013, Francisco was traded by the Braves to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor league pitcher Tom Keeling.

In 124 total games, he hit .227/.296/.412 with 18 HR and 48 RBI. He was released on March 24, 2014.

His contract was purchased by the Blue Jays on April 19, when Maicer Izturis was transferred to the 60-day disabled list, and he made his Blue Jays debut that day as the designated hitter. Francisco enjoyed early success as a member of the Blue Jays, but his inability to hit the breaking ball reduced his effectiveness, and then his playing time. He finished the 2014 season batting .220 with 16 home runs and 43 RBI, but struck out 116 times in 287 at-bats. Tampa Bay Rays On November 19, 2014, Francisco was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. He was designated for assignment on November 25, but was non-tendered and became a free agent. On January 10, 2015, Francisco signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays.

The book was on The New York Times Best Seller list and the Bloomberg Businessweek bestseller list in 2006. The New York Times described the book as a \\"user's manual for how to attract targeted traffic by a deeper understanding of Google Adsense code\\". In his 2007 book Clear Blogging, Robert Walsh wrote that despite The Adsense Codes having a \\"'Make Money Now!' tone\\", it was an \\"extremely useful book\\" for being successful with AdSense. In 2009, he authored Twitter Power, a John Wiley & Sons-published book that introduces readers to Twitter, describing how it became widely used, how to set up a Twitter account, and how to grow their number of Twitter followers. The book received positive reviews in Entrepreneur, January Magazine, and Mint for being written with simplicity and without jargon. In CNET article titled \\"Twitter power? For real?\\", journalist Charles Cooper criticized the book for providing a \\"phony formula where you just paint by the numbers\\" to attempt to lure Twitter followers to become customers.

It introduces readers to Twitter, explaining how to create a Twitter account, market their brands, and gain Twitter followers. Published by John Wiley & Sons, the book generally received positive reviews. It was criticized by a CNET reviewer for giving readers \\"a phony formula where you just paint by the numbers\\" to attempt to ensnare Twitter followers as customers. Synopsis The book aims to teach business owners how to use microblogging service Twitter to network and build a community around their services, and to use tweets for viral marketing. Comm describes and provides examples of five tweet groups: \\"classic, mission- accomplished, question, entertainment and picture tweets\\". In Twitter Power resources section, Comm includes a list of \\"Power Twitterers\\". He also lists Twitters tools like TweetDeck, a dashboard, and Twellow, a user directory. Tony Robbins wrote the book's preface. Reception The News-Gazettes Margo L. Dill said the book is best suited for Internet marketers who want people to view a website or to sell merchandise. She said that reading articles about Twitter instead of the book would be preferable for people using Twitter for personal use like keeping up to date with celebrities. Dill praised the book for being an \\"easy read for a book about technology and social marketing\\". In CNET article titled \\"Twitter power? For real?\\", journalist Charles Cooper criticized the book for providing a \\"phony formula where you just paint by the numbers\\". He said the book is \\"devoted to doling out tips on how to game the system to reel in 'loyal customers and more sales overall'\\". Cooper found Twitter Power contradictory because it says that Twitter is \\"not a place where people come to sell‚Äîand pushing sales hard on Twitter just isn't going to work\\", but almost immediately after says that following people on Twitter could get them to become customers. Mike Werling of Entrepreneur described Twitter Power as \\"Joel Comm's ode to the haiku of blogging\\". Linda L. Richards wrote in January Magazine that Twitter Power was a \\"blazingly lucid book\\" that is \\"well thought out, friendly and entirely easy to follow\\". Mint columnist Sidin Vadukut extolled the book for being \\"free of jargon and effective\\" and that Comm \\"writes with a jocular simplicity that makes you want to play along\\".

(retrieved 25 August 2009) He grew up in Gypsy, Oklahoma and attended Bristow High School. For college, he attended the Institute of American Indian Arts and the California Institute of the Arts. Whitman also studied at the Oklahoma School of Photography in Oklahoma City. Whitman began his art career as a painter but also expanded to photography, installation, and video art. In 1973, he participated in the occupation of Wounded Knee and created art during the struggle. Photography Whitman is known for his black-and-white photography portraying contemporary Native realities, especially his \\"Street Chiefs Series\\" from the 1970s and 1980s. \\"Street Chiefs\\" features images of homeless Native men, primarily in downtown Oklahoma City. \\"The contemporary Indian in the isolation of the city canyons and rural reservations is avoided. The boredom, pain, frustration, poverty of the reality-counterbalance of our lives is harsh, unattractive, and unmarketable.\\" His photographic portraits are compassionate and empathetic to the lives of homeless natives and places them in the larger context of Indian Removal, which forced tribes from all over the country to Indian Territory. From the 1980s onward, Whitman has incorporated text and computer graphics in his photography to create collage or mixed media. His socio-politically informed work often deals with the issues of homeland and dispossession. Videography and acting career Collaborating with Yuchi poet and brother Joe Dale Tate Nevaquaya, Whitman created video to document the Yuchi language. Together they worked with French filmmaker Pierre Lobstein in the 1990s. Whitman read T.C. Cannon's poetry in the video \\"Mazerunner: The Life and Art of T.C. Cannon\\" which was directed and edited by Phillip Albert. This work was subsequently screened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (3/19/1994) and was presented on the Bravo Cable Channel and the Independent Film Channel from May, 1995 through June, 1996.

A proprietary community is a special type of community in which a single owner leases units to multiple tenants. Overview In The Art of Community, anthropologist Spencer MacCallum defines community as follows: \\"A community is an occupation by two or more persons of a place divided into private and common areas according to a system of relations which defines and allocates responsibility for the performance of all activities that might be required for its continuity.\\" (p. 3) \\"A proprietary community is a community administered as a proprietary enterprise in which the relations of every member of the community are formed directly with the proprietary authority.\\" (p. 5) Proprietary communities are thus distinguished from other types of community such as private communities, voluntary communities, and intentional communities by the fact that none of these latter types of community are necessarily organized on a proprietary basis. For example, residential communes, Amish communities, and Israeli kibbutzim are voluntary, but not proprietary. Importantly, proprietary communities are also distinguished from private communities such as home owners' associations, which operate on political principles (democratic voting by the multiple owners), not on proprietary principles (which require a single owner who leases units to multiple tenants). Examples of proprietary communities include hotels, marinas, office buildings, industrial parks, entertainment complexes, and ever-larger and more complex combinations of these. In The Art of Community and other works MacCallum argues that the property relations in a community fundamentally determine the physical structure and dynamics of the community. He writes that proprietary leasehold communities provide an optimal incentive system for communities by internalizing externalities and solving many of the coordination and cooperation problems that plague contemporary societies.  History  The first truly proprietary communities developed in the nineteenth century in the form of forerunners of the modern customer-service-oriented hotel. The twentieth century saw a veritable explosion of proprietary community types, and of ever-increasing generality and scale (for example, Disney World, The Venetian in Las Vegas, and Masdar City in the UAE). However, to date these proprietary communities have only existed within the framework of a larger nation-state‚Äînot as fully generalized independent sovereign jurisdictions. Since the 1960s, there have been various attempts to create such sovereign proprietary communities‚Äîunsuccessfully to date. A new initiative to develop experimental new societies is being spearheaded by the Seasteading Institute, founded by Patri Friedman (grandson of economist Milton Friedman), and funded by PayPal founder Peter Thiel.

This means that the sailor only realized at the end of the race that they have broken a rule.

This holds the same consequences as receiving a \\"DNF\\"; usually a score of the number of boats in the fleet plus one.

As a World War I German fighter ace he was credited with 22 victories. Early life Hans Martin Pippart was born on 14 May 1888 in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918, p. 180 Pippart had built airplanes and become a pilot before the beginning of World War I. He was a principal in the aeronautical firm of Pippart und Noll, which produced Eindekker airplanes. In 1913, he set an aviation endurance record. He joined the German air forces at the start of the war. His initial assignment was as an instructor. Beginning 1 February 1916, he served some time flying artillery coordination missions in two-seaters with Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 220 in Galicia on the Eastrn Front. Single seater scouts were also available to him. On 11 April, he was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. On 19 November 1916, he was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class. On the 21st, he was raised from the enlisted ranks to become an officer. Both Baden and Austria also decorated him. Aerial victories Pippart flew a Roland D.II like this for his first six victories. Hans Pippart flew a Fokker triplane (with duller livery than this) for four wins. Example of Pippart's final mount, used for 12 victories, a Fokker D.VII. Pippart scored his first win on 25 May 1917, after he had been assigned to Kampfstaffel 1 on 18 April. They were operating Roland D.IIs on the Eastern Front against the Russians. By the end of 1917, despite flying on a quiet sector, he had six victories to his credit‚Äîtwo planes and four observation balloons‚Äîand was transferred to Jagdstaffel 13 on the Western Front on 4 December. On 21 February 1918, he took up his balloon busting again, downing a gas bag. On 30 March, a bullet through his craft's engine brought him down unharmed.Jagdgeschwader Nr. II: Jagsgeschwader Berthold, p. 27 By the time he left Jagdstaffel 13, he was a double ace. His six victories over balloons made him an ace on them alone. He had been decorated by both his native Baden and by Austria. On 18 April 1918, he was reassigned to take the command of the Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 19. However, it seems there must have been some lag in his transfer, as victory number ten is scored to his old squadron on 20 April. On 2 May, he scored his first victory flying a Fokker D.VII for his new squadron. That same day, he was decorated with the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. With four wins in May, one in June, and six in August, his score had soon grown to 21. His death By now, Pippart was anxious to receive Germany's highest decoration, the Pour le Merite, as 20 victories made a fighter pilot eligible for the award. He was also eager to go on leave to get married. While waiting, he continued to fly combat.Jagdgeschwader Nr II: Jagdgeschwader Berthold, pp. 77, 82 Pippart ended his career on 11 August 1918. He shot down a balloon, but was hit by anti- aircraft fire and found he had to abandon his airplane at an altitude of 150 feet. His parachute failed to open. In his victory log, he was credited with seven enemy observation balloons destroyed, eight opposing fighter planes vanquished, and seven reconnaissance aircraft shot down. Hans Martin Pippart was buried in his native Mannheim.

A 6'3 Guard, Suttle was a star at Pepperdine University. Collegiate career Suttle attended John C. Fremont High School in Los Angeles and committed to Pepperdine. Suttle played for the Waves from 1979 to 1983 and was a two-time West Coast Conference all-conference pick and the 1983 co-player of the year with teammate Orlando Phillips. While at Pepperdine, Suttle led the Waves to back to back NCAA tournament appearances in 1982 and 1983. Suttle left Pepperdine as the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,702 points. One of the low points in his college career took place in the 1983 NCAA tournament. Pepperdine, the eleven seed in the West Region, faced North Carolina State in the first round and had been leading by six points in overtime. With twenty nine seconds left, Suttle was fouled and went to the free throw line for a one-and-one. He missed the first shot, enabling a change of possession with the Waves still leading by four. Suttle was fouled again on the inbound play and missed again, and North Carolina State would eventually score again on their own missed one-and-one the very next time they had the ball. The game went to a second overtime, where Suttle fouled out of the game and North Carolina State won on their road to the national championship. Professional career After his senior season Suttle was drafted by the Kansas City Kings in the 7th round (152nd pick overall) in the 1983 NBA draft. He made the team and played in 46 games over the 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85 seasons. Suttle averaged 5.9 points and 1.0 assists per game over his NBA career.

The Band was founded in 1898, five years after the university opened. History University President William Rainey Harper organized the group in Autumn 1898. The band's first concert was held on December 16, 1898 in an auditorium in Kent Hall.Books.google.com \\"The military band of the university.\\" The University of Chicago magazine, volume IX, number 3, January 1917, pages 105-112. Retrieved September 10, 2009 Amos Alonzo Stagg, football coach and head of the Athletic Department at the time, was eager for a band to support his teams. He incorporated the band into the Athletic Department and provided it with a budget for travel, equipment, and uniforms. The uniforms consisted of maroon sweaters and ties with white shirts and trousers. In cold weather, the bandsmen also wore overcoats and caps. The band's original primary purpose was to support the football team in their matchups against other Midwestern and East Coast universities. Typical opponents of the time included such schools as Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Northwestern, and other universities known today as football powerhouses. In fact, the University of Chicago has a perfect 4-0 record against Notre Dame in football; the most recent matchup between the two schools took place in 1899. The Band was originally called the UC Military Band, although it had no affiliation with any form of the Armed Forces at that time. However, during World War I, almost every male member of the band enlisted in some branch of the federal service. The band lived up to its name during World War II when it became a color guard military band. With a fluctuating membership of 50 to 100 musicians, the band performed field maneuvers in the classic Big Ten style, spelling out letters and words as wells as forming pictures. However, it added its own zany twist to shows with balloons, confetti, and singing along with the more traditional elements of its performance. The band performed at all home football games at Stagg Field, which stood on the current site of the Regenstein Library. It also travelled to at least one road game each year. In addition to performances at football games, basketball games, and other athletic events, the band put on concerts on a regular basis in Mandel Hall. For many years, the band possessed permanent rehearsal and storage space underneath the stands of Stagg Field. In 1941 the band moved to new quarters in the basement of the Music Building at 5727 S. University Ave., currently called the Statistics and Mathematics Building. The University of Chicago Band The UC Band's fate took a dramatic turn in 1939 when the University cancelled intercollegiate football. However, the organization survived as a concert band for several more years. It seems to have disappeared entirely sometime during World War II. The group reappeared in 1953 as a basketball band. Since then, the band has gone through several periods of activity and inactivity. The band has had a number of directors throughout its history. The most famous was Harold Bachman, a nationally renowned band leader, who served from 1935 until the band's demise sometime in the early 1940s. The current pep band does not have a professional director. Student members take the responsibility for musical and administrative leadership. The band continues to perform regularly at intercollegiate matches in football, men's basketball, and women's basketball. Big Bertha The University of Chicago Band With Big Bertha The band's most notable and memorable feature was its bass drum. Known as Big Bertha, the drum measured eight feet in diameter and required a crew of six members, four to push the drum and two to beat it. After Purdue University brought its own large bass drum to a 1921 Chicago-Purdue football game, Big Bertha was donated in 1922 by C. D. Greenleaf, the president of C. G. Conn Company, a well-known manufacturer of instruments in Indiana. Greenleaf was a Chicago alumnus and an original member of the band. Along with the drum, he gave 100 instruments to the band, each bearing an engraved copy of the university seal. Big Bertha was so large that it could not fit through the doors of Mandel Hall; thus it could not be used during the band's indoor concerts. The drum rested on a cart supported on airplane tires. Mr. Greenleaf sent a representative to the Chicago stockyards to select the largest steers found in the Chicago Stockyards, and had the drum built around drumheads made from their hides. Close up of Big Bertha When the university canceled intercollegiate football in 1939, Big Bertha went into seclusion for a number of years. It was hidden underneath Stagg Field, the old football stadium. Since the first nuclear reactor occurred under the stadium, Big Bertha later became contaminated by radiation from the atomic bomb research during the 1940s. Big Bertha came out of seclusion when a movie about the life of the great John Philip Sousa was to be made and was offered a role in the film, \\"Stars and Stripes.\\" In 1955, Colonel D. Harold Byrd, a long-time benefactor of the Longhorn Band, purchased Bertha from the University of Chicago and gave it a new home in the heart of Texas. Mr. Moton Crockett, former Director of the Longhorn Band, constructed a special trailer for the storage and transportation. The permanent dwelling is in the comfort of the University of Texas at Austin's large Band Hall. Big Bertha is currently owned and used on a regular basis by The University of Texas Longhorn Band.

Overview Bridget Barrett was the victim in murder case that attracted great notoriety at the time, and was \\"the subject of the first Coroner's inquest held in Connemara proper and led to two men being charged with wilful murder on the high seas.\\" Barrett had a sexual relationship with James Mannion of Letterard, which resulted in the birth of their child in July 1845. His aunt put pressure upon him to fulfill his promise of marriage to Barrett, and so Mannion arranged with Barrett on the evening of 10 September, after which they would proceed to Roundstone to get married. The couple met a man named Thomas Cosgriff from where they took a boat from a place called Ruananule, all the time observed by a witness, until they were lost to sight. The body of Bridget Barrett was washed up on the shore at Roundstone on 16 November 1845. Her hands and feet were missing. It was later found that she had been weighted down with an anchor, decomposition separating the body parts. Mannion had been seen in Galway some days later buying clothes; he was met on his way home by Barrett's sister, who obtained no good answer as to the whereabouts of her sister. James Mannion was aged twenty-two when convicted of murder on 5 August 1846, his death sentence reduced to transportation for life. He died in prison, awaiting transportation, on 30 September 1847. Thomas Cosgriff was later found guilty of murder, and transported to Australia on the ship Bangalore. The Convict Resister records that an order was given for his discharge on 4 June 1854.

The group's founding members are songwriter and guitarist JoDee Purkeypile, bassist Sean Crooks, and drummer Chris Sensat. 1995‚Äì2000 13 year old JoDee Purkeypile met 14-year-old Sean Crooks at Roy Bedichek Junior High in 1995. The two began playing songs by Nirvana together in Sean's garage on equipment left behind and taken home by Sean's father, Danny Crooks, from his 6th Street nightclub, Steamboat. No sooner had they learned of each other's love of The Beatles that they began learning songs from a Beatles chord book. By 1996, the two were recording demos on a dual cassette deck, recording guitars and drums live, often using one microphone, then playing back the tape on the playback deck whilst recording vocals on another tape. JoDee received a 4-track Tascam portastudio cassette recorder that Christmas, and soon was recording a number of original songs and dubbing copies for friends. In early 1997, the duo began frequently performing at Rusty Wier's open mic nights held at Gino's, a Blues club in south Austin. They formed a band, calling themselves PigGie Hat, a name JoDee had conceived of years earlier which stood for \\"people getting high\\", and began playing short acoustic sets between acts at Steamboat. That summer, after a handful of shows with temporary rhythm sections, consisting of older musicians from various Steamboat affiliated bands, JoDee and Sean met 13 year old drummer Chris Sensat at Gino's. In October JoDee's childhood friend, 19-year-old Paul Murray, joined the band on bass. On New Year's Day 1998, PigGie Hat recorded their debut EP, Irish Rain, at Affordable Sound for $100. They debuted live at Steamboat on February 19, 1998, and went on to record a full-length album, also titled Irish Rain, and contributed a Christmas song to KLBJ-FM's Local Licks: Yule Rock! before disbanding in May 2000. 2000‚Äì2004 After PigGie Hat's breakup, JoDee, Sean, and Chris formed The Alice Rose and debuted as a trio in May 2001. Purkeypile named the band after his ex- girlfriend's best friend, 16-year-old artist Sadie Warren, who died in a car accident in June 2000. After a few shows, they were joined by Yonkers, New York native Rob Seale on guitar and keyboardist Rachel Solomon in July. Solomon, whose father Andy was keyboardist of the 1960s rock band The Amboy Dukes, played only briefly with the band before leaving to attend the Berklee College of Music. Seale remained with the band until October 2002. The group experimented briefly with moving Sean onto guitar (who had only originally taken up bass due to the fact JoDee and Chris had refused to) in the Summer of 2003. Bassist Eamonn Comerford was recruited during these few uncertain months, but the idea was quickly dropped after a few shows. The band returned to performing as a trio throughout the rest of the year. In 2004, guitarist Brian Pearson was recruited and work began on the band's first album, recorded with producer Ron Flynt, of the 70's power pop band 20/20. Creative disagreements during the sessions led to Pearson's departure in late 2004, and the album was abandoned. Pearson went on to work with Andrew Sega in the synthpop band Iris. 2005‚Äì2011 Nacogdoches, Texas-born keyboardist Brendan Rogers and lead guitarist Colin Slagle joined the band in the fall of 2005, and a fresh attempt at recording their first album began, working with producer Mark Hallman at Congress House Studio in Austin, Texas. Phonographic Memory was released November 10, 2006, on Emerald Wood Records, and was an instant critical success. KUT's David Brown said of the record, \\"...It's easy to understand how special this Austin-based band is: Every song on its debut sounds both strangely familiar and utterly new.\\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6534014 A track from the record, \\"West\\", was named as NPR's \\"Song of the Day\\" on November 27, 2006, and was later featured in the soundtrack of the award-winning indie horror film \\"Splinter\\" by director Toby Wilkins, released in October 2008. Another track from the album, \\"Stop\\", was featured on Latchkey Record's Indy Route: Austin compilation, representing the state of Texas. After touring the United States in support of the album for most of 2007 and releasing a single, \\"Body Offering\\", guitarist Colin Slagle left the band. In March 2008, Austin Monthly named The Alice Rose one of \\"8 Artists to Watch in 2008\\". The quartet began work on their second album that same month, working with producer and engineer Andy Sharp at Music Lane Studio in Austin. During the middle of the sessions, lead guitarist Gregg White joined the group in July. White's first appearance with band was on the Halloween single \\"Bloody Mary\\", engineered by JoDee at Emerald Wood Studio, and released October 31, 2008. White also contributed lead guitar on two songs on the album, \\"Waste Away\\", and \\"There's No One In There\\", both of which were recorded towards the end of the sessions that October in order to include his presence on the album. All Haunt's Sound was released on February 21, 2009 to mixed reviews. Some criticized the production as too radio friendly,http://www.austinsound.net/2009/05/07/the- alice-rose-all-haunts-sound-sr/ while others, like the Austin Chronicle's Austin Powell, said of the record, \\"Not since Robert Harrison's Cotton Mather has an Austin band so successfully churned out power pop nuggets like the Alice Rose.\\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2009-08-07/819316/ The band followed up the album with a four track 7\\" vinyl EP, In a Daze, also recorded by JoDee, and released as a rare limited edition pressing of 100 copies on July 16, 2009, although digital downloads were made available to the group's fanclub. The band's next plan was to release a live album. An acoustic performance at Flipnotics and an electric set at Antone's were both recorded but were scrapped due to technical problems. After the disappointment of All Haunt's Sound, the band's members pursued various side projects. After a handful of live performances in late 2011, The Alice Rose officially on hiatus. 2010‚Äìpresent JoDee Purkeypile began recording his first solo album, October House, in September 2010. Purkeypile wrote, recorded, and performed all instruments on the record's 12 songs.http://thepeverettphile.blogspot.com/2011/09/pheaturing-alumni-jodee- purkeypile.htmlhttp://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2012-04-06/jodee- purkeypile-october-house/l Like The Alice Rose in 2008, he was selected as one of Austin Monthly's \\"11 Artists to Watch\\"http://www.austinmonthly.com/AM/March-2011/11-Bands-to-Watch-in-2011//l in March 2011, and was honored with \\"JoDee Purkeypile Day\\" in Austin on July 28, 2011, the same day October House was released.

It was said that there were only two houses in Tamil Nadu which do not close, one being that of M. G. Ramachandran and the other being his own house where he lived alone till his death in 2008. He was a notorious and aggressive campaigner often defying the party lines and the CM, earning him the name \\"Negamam Napolean\\". This name was also used in the film Amaidhi Padai. He spoke against M.G.R in the Legislative Assembly on his proposal to tax coconut trees in the state and threatened to commit suicide if such a tax was imposed. He was immediately suspended for speaking against his own party and later M.G.R personally promise to withdraw the proposal. He was the president of the Coimbatore wing of ADMK since its inception and was instrumental in making Coimbatore into an ADMK bastion through popular irrigation schemes and his personal charisma.

The party lost the election and later the factions were united under Jayalalithaa.

The title is a reference to the bible verse John 20:1, \\"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\\" (King James Bible), which describes the account of Mary Magdalene witnessing the absence of Christ's body in the sepulchre. Although commercially successful, it has been criticized as being anti-Semitic. Plot synopsis A wealthy and powerful English Jew, Constantine Schuabe, a known adversary of Christian clergy, plots to destroy Christianity by falsely disproving the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He exploits the financial situation of English Biblical expert Sir Robert Llewelyn, and coerces him to plant an inscription upon an ancient tomb entrance. This inscription, supposedly written by Joseph of Arimathea, stated that he took the body of Christ after his death and concealed it there. There ensues a decline in morality in the world before the plot is exposed, thereby postulating the state of a world without the religion of Christ. Reaction After its publication, the Bishop of London preached about When It Was Dark at Westminster Abbey. Calling it \\"a remarkable work of fiction\\" he said it depicts how the world would be if the Resurrection were proved to be a gigantic fraud. \\". . .you feel the darkness creeping round the world, you see . . . crime and violence increase in every part of the world. When you see how darkness settles down upon the human spirit, regarding the Christian record as a fable, then you quit with something like adequate thanksgiving, and thank God it is light because of the awful darkness when it was dark.\\" When It Was Dark has been criticised for its stereotyping of Jews and their portrayal as intent on destroying what Thorne viewed as the most valuable element of British life - the Christian faith and the spiritual values associated with it. Other critics have also labeled the book as anti-Semitic.Stanley E. Porter, Brook W. R.

The organization‚Äôs mission is to inform and strengthen Asia-Pacific policy. NBR brings together specialists, policymakers, and business leaders to examine economic, strategic, political, globalization, health, and energy issues affecting U.S. relations with East, Central, Southeast and South Asia and Russia. Richard J. Ellings is the current president. Funding for NBR's research comes from NBR itself, foundations, corporations, government departments and agencies, and individuals. NBR undertakes a small amount of contract work for public and private sector organizations. Early history In the late 1970s, Senator Henry M. Jackson raised the need for a \\"National Sino-Soviet Center\\" in conversations with Kenneth B. Pyle, director of the University of Washington Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies. He enlisted Edward Carlson, president and CEO of United Airlines, and Thornton Wilson, CEO of the Boeing Company, to assist in creating an institution that would bridge the gap between those responsible for foreign policy decision making and the specialists located in universities and research institutes in the U.S. and abroad. The National Bureau of Asian and Soviet Research was established in 1989, seven years after Jackson's death, with grants from the Henry M. Jackson Foundation and The Boeing Company. The organization's founding president was Kenneth B. Pyle. In 1992 the organization dropped \\"and Soviet\\" to become The National Bureau of Asian Research. Programs, centers, and chairs  Political and Security Affairs  The Political and Security Affairs (PSA) group conducts innovative, forward-looking policy research on a range of Asian political security issues with a particular focus on strategic studies, with the Strategic Asia Program; China security issues; U.S. national security, with the Shalikashvili Chair; and politics and leadership through the Pyle Center.  Trade, Economic, and Energy Affairs  NBR's Trade, Economic, and Energy Affairs (TEEA) group examines market and policy questions for the Asia-Pacific, with a focus on three broad areas: energy security and policy; energy and the environment; and trade, investment, and economic engagement. Over the years, TEEA has undertaken major research initiatives on a broad range of topics, including energy and environmental security, China's IP and innovation policies, Islamic finance, and the status of Myanmar's domestic and foreign policy reforms. The group's longest ongoing initiative is its Energy Security Program, which since 2004 has examined major developments in Asian energy markets and implications for geopolitics. Through TEEA, NBR also serves as the Secretariat of the Pacific Energy Summit, an invitation- only event that describes itself as \\"conven[ing] leaders from government, business, and research to explore innovative solutions to the dual challenges of rising energy demand and a changing climate.\\" Past program speakers have included Louisiana congressman Charles Boustany, former U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Robert Hormats, and Melody Meyer of Chevron. Each year, the Summit is held in a different location across the Asia-Pacific, with past sites including Tokyo, Jakarta, Hanoi, and Vancouver, among others. Center for Health and Aging The Center for Health and Aging was established in 2003. Michael P. Birt, then director of NBR‚Äôs Center for Health and Aging, George F. Russell, Jr., chairman of The National Bureau of Asian Research, Leland H. Hartwell, president of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and William H. Gates, Sr., co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, met in 2004 to discuss the need for prevention, detection, and treatment of illness early enough to reduce the human and financial cost of disease. Plans to organize and host a Pacific Health Summit in Seattle, Washington, emerged from those discussions. George F. Russell, Jr. and William H. Gates, Sr. co-chaired an advisory group, provided the seed funding for the Pacific Health Summit, and were keynote speakers at the inaugural Pacific Health Summit, which was convened in 2005 by two co-sponsoring organizations, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and NBR‚Äôs Center for Health and Aging. Subsequent annual Pacific Health Summits were co-presented by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and The National Bureau of Asian Research, which served as the Summit‚Äôs secretariat from its founding. The world health leaders and top corporate executives attending this invitation- only event have been referred to as \\"global health luminaries.\\"Global Health Luminaries Descending on Seattle, KPLU (6/15/2009) Since NBR concluded the annual meeting in 2012, the focus of the Center for Health and Aging has shifted from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the summit's past themes and concrete outcomes. John M. Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies In 2006, NBR endowed the John M. Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies. The chair recognizes General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his 39 years of military service to the United States, years of leadership on the NBR Board of Directors, and his role as senior advisor to NBR's Strategic Asia Program. The stated mission of the chair is to provide a \\"distinguished scholar in the national security field with an opportunity to inform, strengthen, and shape the understanding of U.S. policymakers on critical current and long-term national security issues related to the Asia-Pacific.\\" The inaugural holder, Dennis C. Blair, was appointed in 2009 by President Obama to serve as the Director of National Intelligence. In September 2010, former Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Thomas B. Fargo came on as the second chair holder. On March 3, 2016, the National Bureau of Asian Research announced that Admiral Greenert (ret.) would become the third holder of the John M. Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies (Shali Chair) at NBR.[7] At NBR, Admiral Greenert brings to bear his years of experience in the U.S. Navy to help inform policy debates on critical issues pertaining to the Asia-Pacific through briefings of senior leaders, and research and writing. Kenneth B. and Anne H.H. Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies In 2006, NBR created the Kenneth B. and Anne H.H. Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies, named in honor of NBR‚Äôs founding president and his wife. The Pyle Center conducts research on Northeast Asia to advance the comprehensive study of the region, particularly as it pertains to its security, political, and economic dynamics. Slade Gorton International Policy Center In 2010, NBR launched the Slade Gorton International Policy Center, named in honor of United States Senator Slade Gorton who served as majority leader of the Washington State House of Representatives, for three terms as state attorney general, and for three terms as United States Senator. The Gorton Center incorporates and builds on current projects in the areas of economics and trade at NBR as well as addressing the issues central to Slade's work on the 9/11 Commission, focusing on how America organizes internally to protect the country from outside threats. National Asia Research Program From 2009 to 2011, NBR and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars partnered to launch the National Asia Research Program (NARP), a national research and conference program designed to reinvigorate and promote the policy-relevant study of Asia. In April 2010, the program selected a premier group of National Asia Research Associates and Fellows, nominated by U.S. research organizations and higher learning institutions with top programs on Asia. Publications NBR publishes books, a peer-reviewed journal, and occasional reports. Since 2001, NBR has published the annual edited volume Strategic Asia, which incorporates assessments of economic, political, and military trends and focuses on the strategies that drive policy in the region through a combination of country, regional, and topical studies authored by Asia studies specialists and international relations experts. Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has served as the research director for the Strategic Asia Program. Since January 2006, NBR has published the biannual journal Asia Policy, which presents academic research on the Asia-Pacific with a focus on policy conclusions for the United States.

He is generally known as the \\"writer of the Pinsk Marshes.\\"Kopach, Olexandra (1972). In Voshchad Toronto: Committee \\"Voshchad\\" Early life Odrach was born in Misiatichy, outside of Pinsk, Belarus, to an impoverished noble family (\\"shliahta\\"). Pinsk in 1930 The Church in Misiatichy The youngest of several children, Odrach was extremely devoted to his mother. An unruly child, at the age of nine he was sent by Polish authorities who then controlled the area to a reform school for boys in Vilnius. His parents were never informed of his whereabouts and did not learn what had happened to him until years later. After serving his time, doing odd renovation jobs around town at the age of eighteen, Odrach enrolled in the Stefan Batory University (now Vilnius University), where he went on to earn a degree in ancient history and philosophy. The family coat of arms depicts Hippocentaurus,Horoszkiewicz, R. Spis rodow szlachty zasciankowej ziemi Pinskiej. - Warszawa, 1937. - S. 31 and the family name dates back to the 16th century, when Grand Duchy of Lithuania was powerful. The Sholomitsky estate was located in a village Sholomichy, near Mysiatichy and Pinsk. It is likely that T. Odrach was baptized in the Church of Saint Paraskeva in Misiatichy, which was founded in the 18th century. The polesian local word \\"odrach\\" means \\"meadows near the Styr river, to Misiatichy\\". World War II With the Soviet invasion of Vilnius in 1939, Odrach fled to his native Belarus, landing a position as teacher of a grammar school in Hliaby's village, after as headmaster of a grammar school in Soshna's village (near Pinsk). Denounced by the Soviets and briefly imprisoned, he then headed south to Ukraine (Volyn Oblast), where he edited several underground newspapers. Still pursued by the Soviets and ultimately forced into hiding, he changed his name from Sholomitsky to Odrach, and managed to escape to Slovakia by way of the Carpathian Mountains. In the West With the war's end, Odrach roamed around Europe for several years. In 1948, after meeting Klara Nagorski in Germany, the two moved to Manchester, England, where they married. They lived in Manchester approximately five years and worked as weavers in a linen factory. In 1953 both Odrach and his wife boarded an ocean liner and sailed for Canada. With the birth of their two daughters, Ruta and Erma, they settled into a Victorian-style house on a small, quiet residential street in Toronto. Working by day in a nearby printing house, at night Odrach returned home to focus on his writing. Odrach produced novels, short stories, and articles for local Ukrainian newspapers. As his books were banned in the Soviet Union, he depended on the small Western immigrant community for his readership. Odrach's major works were written in his Toronto home. Odrach suffered a fatal stroke in 1964. Wave of Terror, detailing the horrors of living under Joseph Stalin, was Odrach's first novel to appear in English. It was published by Academy Chicago Publishers and was translated by his daughter, Erma Odrach.

History The Presbyterian's first built a church on the site in the 1800s to house their congregation. It was a simple structure compared to the current one. The first church was destroyed by fire in 1895. The congregation began planning a larger, more elaborate church soon after but nothing was constructed until 1903. http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/507564.html The current building, which is still used today, was built in 1903 and was designed by Belmont County native George D. Giffin, whose father, Hugh Giffin, worshipped with the Rock Hill Presbyterian Church. The building cost $13,000 to produce. Exterior The church is constructed of red brick with white wooden trim around the doors and windows. The church is designed in the shape of a cross with various entrances jutting from the basic form. The large hipped roof is supported by an entablature with dentil molding. Two large chimneys jut from the roofs along the northern and southern wings. The entrance is located in the large bell tower at the front of the building. The tower contains four pairs of arched openings supporting a large spire. A large bell hangs from a mounting in the tower. Interior The interior is illuminated by large stained glass windows, which are protected by a second plain window. The interior floor plan was designed in an auditorium style layout. The original oak pews are arranged in concentric arches to let people better hear and see the preacher.

The band is active to this day. Colin also performs and releases music as a solo artist and with his side project, The League Bowlers. He also is a member of the Dead Schembechlers and Why Isn't Cheap Trick in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? Since 2006 he has been the owner/operator at Colin's Coffee. In 2018 it was named business of the year in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This is also the spot where he founded the website Pencilstorm.com and where he does most of his writing. Early life In first grade he was exposed to the record KISS Alive and shortly thereafter purchased his first guitar, a Gibson Melody Maker with money saved up from his Columbus Dispatch paper route. He began writing songs and formed his first band \\"The Wire\\" in 8th grade along with classmates Joe Oestreich (bass) and Herb Schupp (drums). All three entered Ohio State together and after receiving an encouraging phone call from Chris Blackwell at Island Records, decided to drop out of school and pursue music full-time. Career The trio changed their name to Watershed and began relentlessly touring the eastern USA opening for established regional acts like Dash Rip Rock, Cowboy Mouth, Hootie and The Blowfish etc. Producer Jim Steinman heard a cassette version of \\"How Do You Feel\\" and soon after convinced Richard Griffiths to sign the band to Epic Records with Frankie LaRocca acting as A&R.; The band recorded their Epic debut \\"Twister\\" at the Powerstation in NYC 1994. Watershed has toured with bands ranging from the Smithereens to the Insane Clown Posse through and remain active to this day. In 2007, Watershed went on hiatus so Joe Oestreich could focus on becoming an author. Colin began recording solo material with producer Mike Landolt (Maroon 5) at Mike's Curry House in Columbus, Ohio. The pair decided to bypass the full-length CDs and focused on singles. The first, \\"Chemotherapy\\" was released May 9, 2009 and it inserted itself into the national debate on health care as a rallying cry for reform. Two more EPs followed: Superior and Still Love Christmas. He also co wrote many tracks with Erica Blinn, for her debut Lovers in the Dust which was also produced by Mike Landolt. Superior was Colin's best received single and got heavy airplay in the Columbus, Ohio area along with some minor play along the East Coast. The video features Colin's son Owen playing the character of \\"Joe\\". His band, Colin Gawel and the Lonely Bones, performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the Bruce Springsteen Fanfest Weekend for their second ever showhttp://www.rockhall.com/pressroom/springsteen-fanfest/ They also performed at Columbus' ComFest among others and were active throughout the Midwest during this period.

It was well received by major news outlets such as the Washington Post https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hitless-wonder-a-life-in-minor- league-rock-and-roll-by-joe-oestreich/2012/07/25/gJQAHtmVBX_story.html The book rekindled a national interest in the music of Colin's band Watershed. In 2013, Colin founded the website Pencilstorm.com and it replaced Colingawel.com as his primary creative writing outlet and features a rotating cast of roughly 20 writers focusing on pop culture and sports. It is still an active website. Colin is a noted Cheap Trick super fan who started the band \\"Why Isn't Cheap Trick in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame?\\" in 2012.

LIJA designs women's studio, run, tennis, and golf clothing in order to inspire healthy and active lifestyles for the youthful- minded women around the world. The company's motto... Play Beautifully.  Company history  Based in Vancouver, BC, the company was originally incorporated as Hyp Golf in July 1997, selling only on women's golf clothes. Linda's innovative designs incorporated elements of European runway fashions, challenging the previously conservative market. By the end of their first year, Hyp Golf was sold in over 25 retailers and endorsed by Pearl Sinn (the first LPGA player to endorse the brand on tour) who won the Rolex First-Time Award at the State Farm Classic wearing Hyp Golf. Other LPGA players who wore Hyp Golf on the LPGA tour include Jill McGill, Grace Park, Kelli Kuehne, Jennifer Greggain, Jamie Hullett, Carin Koch and several others. Hyp Golf fashions were also seen on celebrities including Cheryl Ladd, Catherine Bell, Joumana Kidd, ex-wife of NBA star Jason Kidd, and Stefanie Schaeffer from the popular TV show ‚ÄòThe Apprentice'. Hyp Golf entered the US market in 1999 garnering a reputation as a pioneer of stylish, feminine fit styles in women's golf apparel. Hyp Golf officially rebranded as LIJA after recognizing that the demand for Linda's designs, fusing sport and fashion, extended well beyond the golf course. In 2007, LIJA developed partnerships with local distributors in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa, also opening its first US warehouse and beginning some overseas production. A partnership with a local distributor in the UK followed in 2008. In the same year, LIJA launched its Tour Style Leaders program with other notable players wearing LIJA on the golf course, including Christina Kim, Jane Park, Leta Lindley, Marisa Baena, Jennifer Greggain, Courtney Erdman, Brenda McLarnon and Georgina Simpson giving LIJA exposure on LPGA, Futures and European Tours. Leta Lindley and Georgnia Simpson later went on to become LIJA's tour style leaders for golf. LIJA branched out its fashions in 2008, launching its first ever Leisure collection. In 2009, LIJA launched two more product categories - Active and Tennis - further developing the company's brand as an all-around activewear company. All three new product categories were created with the same philosophy as the golf collection: creating unique designs that enhance athletic performance yet have a fashionable edge. In August 2009 LIJA signed on its first tennis player, Rebecca Marino, to represent its brand as a Tour Style Leader for tennis, after sponsoring her and volunteers at the Odlum Brown Vancouver Open in early August 2009.

Palm oil is the most widely used edible oil, and there is 42 million acres under cultivation worldwide. Commercial production has helped many communities in Africa and South-east Asia tackle local poverty. However, environmentalists have been concerned that such widespread cultivation has led to deforestation and air pollution, and is a threat to endangered species. In 2013, Wilmar changed its approach and endorsed sustainability principles, and now encourages their suppliers and customers to do likewise. History Wilmar commenced operations as a palm oil trading company in 1991. In 2003, it established the first compound fertiliser manufacturing plant with a production capacity of 120,000 tonnes per year, and in 2004 opened the first oleochemicals plant in Shanghai. 2005 * Acquired a controlling interest in Jakarta Stock Exchange listed PT Cahaya Kalbar Tbk, a producer of specialty oils and fats for the chocolate, cocoa confectionery industry, bakery and cakes ingredient industry, and beverage and food industry. 2006 * Renamed Wilmar International Limited on 14 July 2006 upon completion of the reverse takeover of Ezyhealth Asia Pacific Ltd. 2007 * Completed the merger with Kuok Group's palm plantation, edible oils, grains and related businesses in a deal worth US$2.7 billion, as well as a restructuring exercise to acquire the edible oils, oilseeds, grains and related businesses of Wilmar Holdings Pte Ltd (WHPL), including interests held by Archer Daniels Midland Asia Pacific (ADM) and its subsidiaries in these businesses, for US$1.6 billion; * Formed a joint venture (JV) with Olam International Ltd and SIFCA Group, one of Africa's largest agro-industrial groups with significant interests across palm oil, cotton seed oil, natural rubber and sugar sectors in Africa. The JV was aimed at developing a regional leadership position in palm oil, natural rubber, sugar and potentially in other agricultural plantation crops in Africa; * Entry into the Philippines with the setting-up of two coconut oil mills and refineries in Roxas, Zamboanga del Norte and Gingoog, Misamis Oriental. 2008 * Formed a joint venture with Nizhny Novgorod Fats & Oils Group and Delta Exports Pte Ltd to spearhead expansion in Russia and the CIS countries. 2010 * Expanded into the sugar business through the acquisition of Sucrogen Limited, the largest raw sugar producer and refiner in Australia, and PT Jawamanis Rafinasi, a leading sugar refinery in Indonesia. * Acquired Natural Oleochemicals, a leading oleochemicals producer with significant market share in Europe and Asia and a growing presence in the US. 2011 * Further expanded into the sugar business through the acquisition of PT Duta Sugar International in Indonesia and Proserpine Mill in Australia * Expanded its African footprint to Ghana through the acquisition of Benso Oil Palm Plantations Limited, a company listed on Ghana Stock Exchange 2012 * Acquired approximately 30,000 hectares of land in Nigeria for expansion of oil palm plantations; * Established a 50:50 joint venture company, Yihai Kerry Kellogg Foods (Shanghai) Company Ltd, with Kellogg Company for the manufacture, sale and distribution of breakfast cereals and savoury snacks in China; * Formed a 50:50 Joint Venture with Clariant Ltd for production and sales of amines and selected amines derivatives; * Formed strategic partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) in tropical oils refining in Europe, global fertiliser purchasing and distribution, and global ocean freight operations. Launched Olenex CV. headquartered in Rolle, Switzerland to handle the sales and marketing of refined vegetable oils and fats to European Area and Switzerland * Completed four palm oil milling plants with an aggregate hourly capacity of 200 MT *In 2012, Wilmar was named the world's least environmentally friendly company by US news magazine Newsweek.Green Rankings 2012: Global Companies 2013 *Due to their poor environmental performance Wilmar was excluded in 2013 from The Government Pension Fund of Norway, the largest stock owner in Europe. 2015 * Together with First Pacific, acquired Goodman Fielder of Australia and New Zealand for $1.3 billion Australian dollars. Ethical issues In 2004, Friends of the Earth Netherlands performed a review of Wilmar's palm oil operations in Sumatra Riau as undertaken by PT Jatim Jaya Perkasa. Wilmar had 20,800 hectares of land there and the operation was financed by the Dutch Rabobank and the International Finance Corporation. Satellite photos proved that in 2004 the plantations were on sea shore peat rain forests, the depth of the peat being four meters, whereas such land is actually protected under Indonesian law. Nevertheless, in 1997 Wilmar received permission to plant there despite it being peat land. According to locals, the plantation endangers the Sumatran tiger population that inhabits the area, and this became a point of conflict with Wilmar in 2004. Soon after, Wilmar sold PT Jatim Jaya Perkasaand and joined the WWF Palm Oil Association (WWF for World Wide Fund for Nature). According to Friends of the Earth Netherlands, Wilmar International starts forest fires and violates the rights of local populations. In July 2007 Friends of the Earth and two local environmental organizations criticized Wilmar's illegal forest felling in Kalimantan, in Indonesia. As a result of this campaign against Wilmar's projects in Sambas, West Kalimantan, the company agreed to implement a number of new measures and policies. In July 2013, a report published by the WWF which documented that Wilmar (as well as the Indonesian company Asian Agri) were purchasing palm oil fruit which was grown illegally in Tesso Nilo National Park, Sumatra. According to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, both Wilmar and Asian Agri took immediate action to stop this illegal sourcing. In October 2015, Wilmar and Sinarmas, reportedly involved with the case of forest fires in Indonesia that led to the island of Sumatra and Kalimantan burn and cause catastrophic smog In 2018, a Greenpeace International report asserted that Wilmar International is \\"the biggest and dirtiest palm oil trader in the world\\"  Uganda  According to Friends of the Earth, Wilmar and Bidco Africa through Bidco Uganda, have been involved in long running dispute over land with local communities. According to The Guardian in March 2015, the land grab issue has plagued the community of Kalangala for a number of years. In July 2011, residents awoke to \\"find yellow machines churning up her land and razing the crops she had grown in a bid to make way for palm oil plantations.\\" Bidco Africa and Wilmar have made no recorded statement on these matters. Again according to Friends of the Earth International, the projects implications include: Forced displacement, poor labour standards, deforestation, and insecurity amongst other. The community have now taken the conglomerate to court. In February 2016, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) received a petition from the Bugala Farmers Association in Uganda related to UNDP's association with Bidco Africa Ltd. A complaint was also received by the UNDP's Stakeholder Response Mechanism (SRM) and Social and Environmental Compliance Unit (SECU). In May 2016, UNDP visited Kalangala to further investigate the issues surrounding the matter. In November 2016, the UNDP faulted a decision inviting Bidco Ltd into partnership with the United Nations Development Programme's Business Call to Action in Uganda.  Human right violations in 2016  On 30 November 2016, Amnesty International published a report into working conditions on the Wilmar International plantations and refineries in Indonesia. It alleged human rights abuses, including \\"forced labour, low pay, exposure to toxic chemicals and discrimination against women\\". According to Amnesty International, Wilmar International profited from 8- to 14-year-old child labour and forced labour. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from exposure to herbicides containing paraquat. Wilmar customers include FAMSA, ADM, Colgate-Palmolive, Elevance, Kellogg's, Nestl√©, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. Wilmar palm oil may be used in popular products like Magnum ice-cream, Colgate toothpaste, Dove (toiletries), Knorr soup, KitKat, Pantene shampoo, Ariel, and Pot Noodle.THE GREAT PALM OIL SCANDAL: LABOUR ABUSES BEHIND BIG BRAND NAMES Amnesty International 30.11.2016 Wilmar Initiatives On 5 December 2013, Wilmar committed to a No Deforestation, No Peat & No Exploitation Policy for both its own operations and third party suppliers. It promised to stop buying from suppliers who cleared forest, drained peat land, or exploited locals. This was lauded as a transformational step towards responsible and sustainable palm oil development. Preliminary analysis estimates that Wilmar's commitment will eliminate more than 1.5Gt CO2 emissions in total between now and 2020. In 2015, Wilmar won the Special Recognition Award at the Singapore Apex CSR Awards 2015 organised by the Global Compact Network Singapore, Singapore Business Federation and The Business Times. It was hailed for being the first major palm oil player to step up to ensure its supply chain is de-linked from any forest destruction and human rights abuse.

Physiology  The P wave is a summation wave generated by the depolarization front as it transits the atria. Normally the right atrium depolarizes slightly earlier than left atrium since the depolarization wave originates in the sinoatrial node, in the high right atrium and then travels to and through the left atrium. The depolarization front is carried through the atria along semi-specialized conduction pathways including Bachmann's bundle resulting in uniform shaped waves. Depolarization originating elsewhere in the atria (atrial ectopics) result in P waves with a different morphology from normal. Pathology Characteristic peaked P wave of cor pulmonale Peaked P waves (> 0.25 mV) suggest right atrial enlargement, cor pulmonale, (P pulmonale rhythm), but have a low predictive value (~20%). A P wave with increased amplitude can indicate hypokalemia. It can also indicate right atrial enlargement. A P wave with decreased amplitude can indicate hyperkalemia. P-wave changes in left and right atrial hypertrophy Bifid P waves (known as P mitrale) indicate left- atrial abnormality - e.g. dilatation or hypertrophy. If at least three different shaped P waves can be seen in a given ECG lead tracing, this implies that even if one of them arises from the SA node, at least two others are arising elsewhere. This is taken as evidence of multiple (i.e. at least two) ectopic foci, and is called multifocal (or more correctly, multiform) atrial rhythm if the rate is ‚â§100) or multifocal atrial tachycardia if the rate is over 100. This appears particularly commonly in exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease. If the baseline has a totally irregular form, this suggests fibrillatory waves of atrial fibrillation or possibly artefact; a saw tooth shaped baseline suggests the flutter waves of atrial flutter. With either of these rhythms, if the ventricular rate is fast, the fibrillatory or flutter waves can easily be misinterpreted as P waves. Absence of the P wave with a flat baseline may indicate: * Fine atrial fibrillation * Sinoatrial arrest (with a secondary escape rhythm) If P waves are not clearly delineated in the surface ECG, a Lewis lead may be used to better visualize P waves. Atrial repolarization This occurs a mean of 320 ms after the end of the P wave, with a duration of 2-3 times that of the P wave and a polarity always opposite to that of the P wave. It is represented on the surface ECG by a so- called Ta wave. The clinical relevance of this is that, although a normal phenomenon, the nadir of the Ta wave can occur just after the QRS complex and cause ST depression similar to (and easily mistaken with) that occurring with disease states such as cardiac ischaemia.

Township Road 212 functions as a western extension of Highway 550 and connects to Bassano.  History  Highway 550, along Highway 873 between Brooks and Duchess, was originally designated as part of Highway 2, which at the time was an east-west interprovincial highway that ran through Calgary and Medicine Hat (the present-day Highway 2 was designated as Highway 1). In 1941, Highway 2 was renumbered to Highway 1 to allow for contiguous numbering through Western Canada along the future Trans-Canada Highway, which was commissioned in 1949.

Employment , Chinese formed the largest group of self- employment permit holders in Botswana, though Zimbabwean expatriates were the largest group of foreign workers overall. Statistics for that year also showed 1,273 Chinese expatriates holding employee permits, 11.3% of the total number. This represented 36% growth over the previous year's number of 937. Many of the self-employed work as traders in the Oriental Plaza in Gaborone. There is also an increasing number of Chinese traders in Francistown, an influx noted by locals as early as 2005. In local slang, poor-quality Chinese goods are referred to as \\"Fong-kongs\\". Some locals accuse Chinese businesspeople of violating local labour laws by forcing employees to work long hours, while others praise them for the low prices they offer. In July 2008, new trade laws repealed the earlier Specialised Dealer licence system under which had been primarily used by Chinese and other foreigners. It was speculated that this could lead to self-employed Chinese traders being forced to leave the country; the Gaborone City Council indicated that it would be willing to license the Chinese under the \\"Miscellaneous Trade\\" category for an adjustment period of two years. The Chinese ambassador also speculated that local traders might eventually be able to out-compete the Chinese. In early 2009, Chinese were also banned from dealing in clothes; local traders had complained that the Chinese were using the Specialised Dealer system to engage in general retail sales. New trade laws reserved 13 types of retail businesses for locals only: general clothing shops, general dealers, car washes, auctioneers, fresh produce shops, funeral parlours, hairdressers, laundromats, petrol filling station, take-away restaurants, cleaning services, and curio shops. Lawmakers have also expressed concern about the rising number of unskilled Chinese labourers coming to Botswana to work in jobs such as ditch-digging, even in deep rural areas. According to government records in 2006, there were 1,094 Chinese citizens legally registered to work in the construction industry in Botswana, slightly more than a third of the total number of legal Chinese residents at the time. A number of construction projects managed by Chinese companies, such as the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport expansion project, primary schools in Serowe, Oriental Plaza, and Dikgathong Dam, illegally employed Chinese workers whose had no work permits or whose permits had not yet been approved. However, in response to these accusations, the Chinese embassy claimed that the work permit process was already very cumbersome and that it was difficult to find locals willing to work on construction projects. Media The Oriental Post (Âçé‰æ®Âë®Êä•), a Chinese-language weekly newspaper, was launched in May 2009. It is believed to be the first newspaper of Botswana to be printed in an international language other than English. Its president is Miles Nan (ÂçóÂ∫öÊàå), who also runs a construction company in Botswana. Its editor-in-chief is Tian Wentai (Áî∞ÊñáÊ≥∞). Organisations The Botswana Chinese General Chamber of Commerce (ÂçöËå®Áì¶Á∫≥Âçé‰∫∫Âçé‰æ®ÊÄªÂïÜ‰ºö) was established in 1998. As late as 2007 it was the only non- profit Chinese organisation in the country. It organises a variety of activities including ping pong tournaments and celebrations of Chinese holidays such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. They have also cooperated with the Botswana authorities to translate local laws into Chinese for the benefit of those who do not speak English. In 2009, a number of other Chinese organisations were founded. One was the Botswana-China Friendship Association (ÂçöËå®Áì¶Á∫≥-‰∏≠ÂõΩÂèãÂ•ΩÂçè‰ºö), in which Miles Nan was also tapped to be the executive chairman, and Botswana's former ambassador in Beijing was chosen as an honorary chairman. Another was the Botswana Huaren Golf Association (ÂçöËå®Áì¶Á∫≥Âçé‰∫∫È´òÂ∞îÂ§´ÁêÉÂçè‰ºö), which organised its inaugural tournament among locals as well as Chinese, Kenyan, Korean, South African, and Zimbabwean expatriates in July 2009.

Browder Professor of History College of Freedonia On the 13 May 1880, in Vienna, the Deutscher Schulverein (DSV/German School Association) was formed. In 1881, the Allgemeine Deutsche Schulverein zur Erhaltung des Deutschtums im Auslande (General German School Association for the Conservation of Germanness Abroad), was formed in Berlin by Hamburg lawyer Julius Scharlach. It was modeled on the Viennese DSV. The associations in Vienna and Berlin initially worked closely together. There are donation cards with the imprint of DSV-Berlin and Vienna in existence. In 1908, the Berlin association was renamed Verein f√ºr das Deutschtum im Ausland (Association for Germanness Abroad), and the current abbreviation VDA, which is usually used, was adopted. The VDA had its own symbol, a woman's head with braids and Crown. During this time, the DSV in Vienna continued under its original name. During World War I, the VDA was at work in the service of the fighting soldiers. Its collections (donation cards such as folk song cards, Our Field Gray etc.) were there to benefit the wounded, displaced persons and the next of kin of fallen soldiers. After 1919, the Association in Austria continued under the name Deutscher Schulverein S√ºdmark (German school association South region). In Germany, the work of VDA was long interrupted after the war. It was not until 1925 that the association could commence its work again in Berlin, later Dresden. It was renamed Volksbund f√ºr das Deutschtum im Ausland in 1933. VDA welcomed the coming of the Nazi regime, as it shared its ideology with the Nazis, including elements such as racism.Nazi Germany and the American Hemisphere, 1933-1941 Alton Frye Yale University Press,page 17, 1967 It was used to promote Nazi political and racist ideas and was especially active in schoolsGrowing Up Female in Nazi Germany - Page 220 Dagmar Reese - 2006 University of Michigan Press When Klagenfurt in Austria canceled the association's planned rally in 1933, some 18,000 participants flocked to Passau instead.Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 82f During the pre-war years and through World War II, the VDA distributed over 1,200 different donation badges, postcards and other items to raise funds for its charity work. This was done alongside other similar charity drives by organisations such as the Winterhilfswerk (WHW), the Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (DRK/German Red Cross) and others. In the middle of 1930s the organization found itself in dispute with Hitler, as it had more extensive territorial claims against other countries than Hitler was willing to demonstrate in international arena; after the Second World War started, VDA together with SS was engaged in preparing and carrying out ethnic cleansing in territories conquered by Germany.German Scholars and Ethnic Cleansing, 1920-1945, Issue 2006 Michael Fahlbusch, Ingo Haar page 160 In 1955, it was reestablished under its former name Verein f√ºr das Deutschtum im Ausland at the initiative of the Bavarian Prime Minister Wilhelm Hoegner, the Minister of Culture Alois Hundhammer, the chairman of the German Confederation of Trade Unions in Bavaria Max W√∂nner, industrialist Rolf Rodenstock and several prominent public figures.

The group auditioned with over hundred acts and became the then-highest placed non-singing act to ever compete in the series' history, finishing third. They lost this distinction when Olate Dogs won season seven in 2012. Afterwards, they began to work with Jerry Springer on a live version of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent\\". They spent three months performing at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas and one month performing the live show at MGM Grand Foxwoods in Connecticut. In 2010, the band sealed a deal with the MGM Grand in Las Vegas to have their own show. After runs of shows at the MGM, Tropicana and The Quad on the Las Vegas Strip, they last moved the show to the Saxe Theater at Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas Strip. Their interactive show features the audience being given drumsticks and other unique instruments, incorporating non-traditional items like power tools, ladders, buckets and trashcans.

It runs from an intersection with Maine State Route 25 in Standish north to the town of Gilead, where it ends at U.S. Route 2 (US 2) near the New Hampshire border. The northern portion of the route runs along the border, and actually crosses into and out of New Hampshire twice. SR 113 is located near New Hampshire Route 113, as both routes pass through Conway, New Hampshire (linked via a short stretch of US 302). Despite this, they are two completely unrelated routes. History State Route 113 was originally designated in 1925, running along its current routing from Standish and ending in Fryeburg at the intersection with U.S. Route 302. In 1937, the route was extended northward to Gilead along an alignment near the New Hampshire border, actually crossing the border three times along the way. Between 1940 and 1941, the original routing of Route 113 in Stow was shifted onto a new alignment (now the current alignment), with the old loop around Stow in New Hampshire becoming New Hampshire Route 113B (which is considered an unnumbered town-way in Maine).Floodgap Roadgap's RoadsAroundME: Maine State Route 113 North Fryeburg Junction list New Hampshire Route 113B NH 113B southbound New Hampshire Route 113B is a long loop road in the states of Maine and New Hampshire. Despite its designation, Route 113B never intersects its implied \\"parent\\", New Hampshire Route 113, nor does it ever approach it. Instead, Route 113B is a loop off Maine State Route 113, producing the very unusual situation of one state having a suffixed route off another state's highway. NH 113B starts at State Route 113 in Stow, runs approximately one mile west into New Hampshire, then turns north. The route crosses the border back into Stow, and ends mere feet later at State Route 113. This intersection lies feet south of where State Route 113 crosses into North Chatham, New Hampshire. Of the route's 3.95 miles (6.36 km), 2.95 are in New Hampshire. The sections of the highway in Maine are under MaineDOT maintenance, and are technically considered a townway (unnumbered highway). This is the only instance in New Hampshire of a suffixed route carrying the numerics for a highway signed in another state. Three similar instances exist in New England. One is in Massachusetts with Massachusetts Route 114A, a loop of Rhode Island Route 114 (Rhode Island Route 114A is the designation for the small portions of this loop within Rhode Island). The other two are in Vermont: Vermont Route 10A is a continuation of New Hampshire Route 10A, a loop off New Hampshire Route 10, and Vermont Route 22A is a continuation of New York State Route 22A, a spur route from New York State Route 22. This is one of two instances where a New Hampshire state route crosses entirely into another state but remains signed as a New Hampshire route. New Hampshire Route 153 skirts the eastern shore of Province Lake and crosses the border into Parsonsfield, Maine, but maintains NH 153 signage throughout.

The cast included many prominent actors and celebrities such as Craig Ferguson and Andy Richter as the voice of Lenny. The movie had television release in Europe and after video release received generally poor reviews.  Story  Doctor Island (Joe Morton) has invented a computer microchip he plans to use to train dogs instantly. However, his former colleague, Doctor Wagner (Craig Ferguson), has other plans for the microchip: he wants to implant copies in every child in order to brainwash them to come work for him after they turn 18, and be exceedingly loyal. In the fight between Doctor Island and Doctor Wagner's henchmen, Hanky (Andrew Shaifer), Panky (Jeff Chase), and Doctor Island get injured and his dog Lenny (Andy Richter) is injected with the computer microchip. On the run, Lenny finds his brainpower growing. And when he finds a young boy, Zach (Sammy Kahn), to be his friend and savior, Lenny discovers he can talk. Lenny (continually amazed by the new powers the embedded microchip keeps giving him), Zach (full of unrequited love for longtime friend Becky), and school newspaper reporter Becky (Stephanie Sherrin) (out to write the story of the century) teams up with downtrodden police officer John Wyndham (Michael Winslow) to defeat Dr. Wagner and his henchmen. The showdown culminates at the school concert given by Pop Star Angie (Maria de los Angeles Monasterio), where Zach's inspiring speech and Lenny's audio powers combine to incriminate Doctor Wagner, who is arrested by the police captain, now appreciative of Officer Wyndham's talents for police-work and crime-solving.

Notable appearances for Staley have been at Hickory Motor Speedway (where he won the first race ever held there) and Langhorne Speedway (where he won a race in 1957 using a Chevrolet Bel Air vehicle). Staley won three races driving the Julian-Petty- prepared 1957 Chevy Bel Air. The first win was on August 26, 1957 at the Coastal Speedway in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It was a 200-lap race and he had lapped the field. The second win came a few weeks later on September the 5th. It was at the New York State Fairgrounds and once again he had lapped the field driving the Petty prepared 1957 Chevy. His third and last win came on September the 15th in the same car at the Langhorne Speedway in Pennsylvania. He had the field lapped twice this time. North Wilkesboro Speedway named the race after him during the early 1970s. Staley's greatest successes came at road courses where his average finishes would be in ninth place.

It held village status prior to December 30, 1970. Truax is located southwest of Regina and approximately southeast of Moose Jaw.  History  The most modern grain elevator in the surrounding area, built in 1964 Truax is situated almost equidistant between Radville and Moose Jaw on the Canadian National Railway line that was closed by CN in the late 1980s. Southern Rails Cooperative, a farmer-owned cooperative, took over operation of the line, and it still operates today, with farmers loading their grain directly into rail cars, bypassing the grain companies, and shipping directly to port. The rail line terminates at the Truax grain elevator, built in 1964 and now given Saskatchewan Heritage status with all that encompasses and protects. Both of these accomplishments, the Southern Rails Cooperative and the Saskatchewan Heritage Status of the Truax grain elevator, were led by Paul Beingessner, a Truax resident until his death. At its peak, Truax had a lumberyard, a gas station, a hardware store, a school, an indoor rink and a curling rink, and two churches (Anglican and Roman Catholic). The gas station and convenience store closed in the mid 1980s. St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church is no longer open, but when it was mass was held every Saturday night at 7:00 in the winter, and 7:30 in the summer. St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church was decommissioned as an official Roman Catholic Church on Sunday, June 25, 2011 at 3:00 pm CST. Once it was decommissioned it served the Truax community on July 2, 2011 by acting as a cool and calm sanctuary where the hundreds of attendees could gather and watch the Truax 100th Homecoming slide show presentation. The decommissioned St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church was ordered demolished by the Roman Catholic Church in 2012 and it was taken down in January 2013. This is a view of a prosperous Truax in October 1920 Truax held its 100th year celebration and Centennial Homecoming on July 2, 2011. There were approximately 400 people that attended the celebration, which included a parade of floats showing Truax history from the past 100 years and modern agricultural equipment as well. Many hours of old friends re-connecting and old timers showing younger people the history of this special little town happened on July 2, 2011. There were many interesting displays, Truax souvenirs to purchase (they sold out!), a slide presentation of 100 years of Truax photographic memories, and a silent auction of many authentic Truax mementos from history. Frank Kirkpatrick, the organizing director of the 100th Homecoming Celebration, was able to highlight some of the most prominent old timers from the Truax area and he also spoke a little about their impact and the impact of the many special Truax people that added to the community that had already passed on. A delicious lunch was BBQ'd up, then ice cream of many flavours was provided free of charge, a wonderful catered supper was enjoyed by the several hundred attending. Later there was a line dancing lesson on Main Street, then a couple hours of live music was enjoyed by many in the Truax Community Hall. As the sun set, and it was a beautiful night for a sunset, Frank lit up a bonfire on Main Street and the hundred or so remaining attendees came together around the fire to have one final time of fellowship as this wonderful day came to a close. Truax was known to its many inhabitants over the years as \\"The Bestest Place in the World\\"!

It grows in a variety of habitats, including winter-wet depressions in sandy, loamy, laterite, or quartzite soils. D. macrantha produces small, cup-shaped carnivorous leaves along a long stem that can be high as it climbs. Its white or pink flowers emerge from June to November, blooming earlier in the more northern range.D'Amato, Peter. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press: Berkeley, California. pp. 158.Erickson, Rica. 1968. Plants of Prey in Australia. Lamb Paterson Pty. Ltd.: Osborne Park, Western Australia. pp. 35-36. D. macrantha was first described and named by Stephan Endlicher in 1837. It has a large, variable range, which has led to considerable synonymy. Several subspecies have been published, but most have been moved to or lumped in with the taxon D. stricticaulis.Rice, Barry. 2009. The tuberous erect & scrambling Drosera. The Carnivorous Plant FAQ. Accessed online: 25 August 2009. Drosera stricticaulis itself was even first described by Ludwig Diels in 1906 as a variety of this species and was later elevated to species rank. One of the more recent subspecific taxa to be described was D. macrantha subsp. eremaea in 1992 by N. G. Marchant and Allen Lowrie (the subspecies D. macrantha subsp. macrantha is an autonym). In 1996, Jan Schlauer provided a comprehensive revision and new field key to the genus and also moved subspecies eremaea to a subspecies of D. stricticaulis, though he did not give a specific rationale for this move.Schlauer, J. 1996. A dichotomous key to the genus Drosera L. (Droseraceae). Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 25(3): 67-88.

He was the second son of Mieszko I of Poland, but eldest born from Mieszko's second marriage to Oda, daughter of Dietrich of Haldensleben, Margrave of the North March. Life Little is known about his first years of life. Mieszko's first appearance is in the document \\"Dagome iudex\\" (ca. 991/92), along with his parents and brother Lambert. The purpose of the document was to protect Mieszko's and Lambert's inheritance from their older half-brother Boles≈Çaw I the Brave, who isn't named there. After Mieszko I's death (25 May 992), a war began between Boles≈Çaw I and his half-brothers. There is disagreement among historians as to the course of the conflict; the struggle may have lasted only a few weeks or may have only finished in 995. In the end, Boles≈Çaw I took control over all the territories of his father and expelled his stepmother and half-brothers from Poland to Germany. Mieszko's further fate is unknown, but in 1032 a certain Dytryk (son of either Mieszko or his brother Lambert) returned to Poland and took control over part of the country after the fall of Mieszko II Lambert. Dytryk's reign was short-lived: in 1033, he was deposed and expelled by Mieszko II, who reunited all Poland.

Both depict a goth girl named Germaine and her neurotic pet squirrel, Foamy. The webtoon series is ongoing, with publication every two weeks at Ill Will Press, YouTube, and Newgrounds. Publication history The comic book series was created first. It focused solely on Germaine; Foamy only made random comments about the current situation. The webtoon debuted in early 2003. It started with this same set-up, but over the years Germaine's character took a back seat as Foamy developed into an angry, \\"wisdom-spreading\\" cult leader and his rants against society became increasingly popular. Episodes are mainly located at Ill Will Press, YouTube, and Newgrounds. A new episode of Neurotically Yours is posted approximately once every two weeks. To date, there are over 400 official episodes of Neurotically Yours. There are also a number of fan-produced episodes circulated among various fan sites on the Internet. The Ill Will Press website also hosts numerous Topical Rants, in which Foamy talks about a particular topic. Some of these, such as \\"The Best Thing Ever\\" and \\"People and Animals\\", have been made into official animated episodes. In 2009, Mathers began hosting all of the Neurotically Yours webtoons exclusively on YouTube and Newgrounds. Two reasons provided for the change-over included poor quality copies being made and distributed without credit to Mathers. Mathers also cited overall bandwidth usage, stating that the monthly bills were \\"insane\\". Having changed over to YouTube, Mathers was able to provide viewers with a feed to subscribe to more episodes (both current and past episodes), as well as limiting his overall monthly bill, thus making site maintenance easier. From 2009 to 2011, Mathers published Neurotically Yours in a comic-strip format. Most of the strips were single- panel format, with the occasional entry in two or three panels. Plot  Original series  The central story line revolves around the interactions between Foamy and Germaine and, on occasion, their relationships with other characters. The story starts off with Germaine sitting in front of a computer typing away, while Foamy remains a constant distraction in the background and has occasionally contemplated suicide. These themes become the premise for both the main story arc, as well as the development of the characters themselves. As the plot continues to develop, Germaine dedicates her time trying to have her poetry published, spending hours on it and then being rejected. As time goes on, Germaine becomes the subject of men's attention, while becoming increasingly more comfortable in her own body. Eventually, she attempts to manipulate events via use of her sexuality. However, in later episodes, Germaine discusses the idea of clothing being used to objectify women and expresses dismay with this trend, though it eventually becomes part of her character. She works as a prostitute to support herself. After a journey of self-discovery, Germaine eventually ends up in the same general cycle she was in before. She finds herself in opposition to various issues regarding women and even blaming these issues for causing people to accept such degrading roles in life. Even with all the self-development, self- discovery, and enlightening moments, Germaine seemingly develops into the same role she had prior to leaving. She struggles with weight and image issues, and yet again feels discriminated against.  Reboot (2011)  In August 2011, the cartoon was rebooted. Creator Jonathan Ian Mathers posted in his blog and Facebook: \\"Is it really the last Foamy episode? No. It's just a way to start things over.\\" Mathers acknowledged that the cartoon had become increasingly mature and dark, which had caused reader confusion and loss of his younger audience. The reboot promised that Germaine will make \\"better choices\\" and that the \\"sexual content will be dropped by 90% at least\\", although the comic will still be aimed at adults. A Topical Rant was released along with the first episode of the reboot. In it, Foamy blasts Hollywood for its many unsuccessful reboots but points out that reboots can work when done right. The squirrel states that the creator will focus his efforts on only one web- series. It will be \\"a bit shinier\\" in style, although Foamy \\"will still be ticked off\\" and Germaine \\"will still be jiggly\\". He extorts his listeners to \\"just ******* relax\\". Within the cartoon, Germaine is given the option by Foamy to reset her life, thus undoing the previous ten years of her life. Foamy describes this as being a do over of \\"everything\\", which he has given out only three times before. The reboot involves a physical move: they move out of New York City to a small town in Connecticut. This changes Germaine's \\"personal turmoil\\" from financial to not fitting in, while Foamy is \\"150%\\" angrier.  Post reboot  Germaine makes attempts to reform her character and personality, including changing her hair and getting breast-reduction surgery. Despite Mathers's claims however, not long after the reboot the series began to return to the original style, relying heavily on jokes and content derived on Germaine's sexuality. Germaine returns to using her sexuality to financially support herself. In January 2015, Foamy moves out in protest over Germaine's \\"stupidity\\" and makes his home in a post-office box. The apparent continued focus on other characters in the series was also quickly dropped, leaving only more known series regulars such as Pilz-e and Begely. However, on September 10, 2015, Mathers uploaded a new cartoon, revealing that Germaine had suffered a mental breakdown. The episode picks up six months after the previous one, and the new cartoon showed her meeting Foamy outside a mental hospital in New York City, and it was revealed that much of the sexual content shown in past cartoons had actually been a series of hallucinations by Germaine. Mathers said that he had been planning the episode for a long time, and had deliberately reverted to crude sexual humor in order to emphasize how the pressure of a sexually obsessed society can warp women's perspectives. Mathers now claims that Germaine will \\"rebuild herself\\", and says that \\"[Germaine] will be a little darker, and a bit more jaded, but she'll figure things out.\\" Card Cult Foamy has established the \\"Cult of Foamy\\", also known as the \\"Card Cult\\". In the real world, the cult advertises the Ill Will Press website. Mailing in for a card is no longer required to join, as Mathers has created a downloadable cult pack that includes printable cards, a cut-out Foamy \\"virtual relic\\", an MP3 of the cult song, and digital files including wallpaper. Official cards can still be requested and autographed ones can be purchased from Mathers. The website shop also offers trading cards, T-shirts, CDs and DVDs, books, and toys. In the comic, the Card Cult's rise correlates to Foamy's development, in terms of his rants and increasing importance relative to Germaine. The points of the cult are \\"the slow demise of the human race through squirrelly force\\" and to \\"take over the world\\". When a member posits that the human race will eventually self-destruct anyway, Foamy replies that they can still \\"speed up the process.\\" In terms of the story, there have been many secrets surrounding the Cult of Foamy. One conspiracy theorist believes that Foamy has lived an unnaturally long life with many owners (who were later found dead), and has \\"over the years\\" been \\"amassing his minions\\" while subtly trying to take over the world through various means of influence. Foamy alludes to his power over the world and time when he offers the reset button to Germaine in 2011; the reboot does not eliminate the Cult, although it \\"sets it back a bit\\". The number of members is a mystery. In each of the two Cult Meeting episodes, the only attendants are Foamy, Pilz-E, and Begley. In contrast, at one point 3,000 people gathered outside Germaine's apartment \\"with offerings of bagels and cream cheese\\". Fictional character biographies Animal characters Foamy the Squirrel is a major character. He is an opinionated, foul-mouthed squirrel who lives with his owner Germaine. Foamy and Germaine both speak out against the stupidity, injustice, and annoyances they perceive in life ‚Äì both their fictional life or in the real world. Foamy's other appearances in the web series include singing \\"Squirrel Songs\\" (to raise money for the \\"Church of Foamy\\") and answering \\"Foamy Fan Mail\\" (which he hates, believing the questions to be stupid or repetitive). Foamy is 400 years old and has had 632 owners. His stated purpose is to take over the world; for this purpose he founded the Foamy Card Cult, and he combined old robots with the brains of his former owners to create an army. Pilz-E is an insane, bespectacled squirrel who is addicted to medication for a number of psychosomatic sicknesses. There is also implication that he is being used for medical experiments. Pilz-E's banter is often nonsensical, caused by medication-induced hallucinations. He is good hearted, but he tends to misunderstand words or take people (usually Germaine) too literally. Despite being considered Foamy's friend, Foamy seems to find it hard at times to deal with his drugged up behavior. Germaine brought Pilz-E with her to Connecticut because she feels he cannot be left alone. The Hatta is a black squirrel who is both a stereotype for and very defensive of African-American culture. He is quick to pull the race card in any situation and has even starred in his own rants. Much like Begley, he appears less frequently in the series than either Pilz-E or Germaine. Begley is a purple-mohawked British squirrel who rebels against authority figures and generally fulfills the stereotype of punk. He came to New York in Anchovie's suitcase, following jail time for calling the Queen a \\"wanka\\". He enjoys sexuality (unlike Foamy), although he is willing to help Foamy commit acts of mischief. He backpacked to Germaine's new home in Connecticut, angry at her for leaving him behind in New York with Anchovy. He appears infrequently in the series, sometimes breaking the fourth wall to ask for more episodes. Roswell is Jack Partfine's dog. He believes Foamy is an old evil cult leader bent on world domination, or possibly the mythical squirrel Ratatoskr or a descendant. He serves as a foil to Foamy; one of the few characters who does not underestimate him in any way, yet is ignored by the rest of the world. In the reboot he, like Foamy, whines about Connecticut and longs to move back to New York. Puff is Betty's pet cat who listens to music and is always seen wearing pink headphones. Human characters Germaine Endez is Foamy's \\"owner\\" through most of the episodes. Originally living in a New York City apartment, she moved to her grandfather's Connecticut house after the 2011 reboot. Her struggles provide angst for Neurotically Yours: she is a poet seeking publication, she is highly sexualized, she overeats and has weight issues, she experiments with witchcraft and meditation but seems to be an atheist, she changes her bra/cup size multiple times through surgery and magic, and her indecision between heterosexuality and bisexuality have pushed Foamy to demand she \\"pick a side already\\". Germaine also constantly suffers from money problems; her spotty employment record includes working in an occult bookstore,Mentioned in the CD \\"Foamy: Live at GBCB'S\\" prostitute, sales clerk at Walk-Mart, nude model for a New York art school, and barista at Starschmucks. In the early episodes, Germaine was flat chested, and a more stereotypical Goth/Punk, somewhat feminist young woman; before the reboot, her appearance often changed, mostly in her weight, bust size, hair style/color. After the reboot, Germaine attempted to better herself by getting breast- reduction surgery and abandoning her gothic fashion sense, although she eventually failed to do so, reversing her breast-reduction and readapting her gothic style. Anchovie Allcock, also known as Pizza Guy, is Germaine's stalker and a general pervert. Originally a failing pizza delivery boy in England, he moved to New York after seeing Germaine on FaceNook. He has had various jobs: pizza delivery man, clerk at Burger Goo, security guard at a lingerie shop, and gym teacher. He is a very persistent and proficient stalker, secretly photographing Germaine to post on a website and finding ways to interact with her. Anchovie hates Foamy because the squirrel foils many of his plans for Germaine; Foamy, on the other hand, just thinks Anchovie is pathetic. Germaine kills and dismembers Anchovie in the background of a Topical Rant, but he subsequently reappeared in a post-reboot and Begley has told Germaine that he has taken to performing more disturbing acts of stalking in Germaine's absence like collecting left-behind hair. After Germaine underwent breast-reduction surgery, Anchovie was horrified, revealing his obsession with Germaine to be 100% superficial in nature. Franklin O'Kee is an elitist who loves working at Starshmuck's coffee shop. He despises Foamy, who refuses to kowtow to \\"coffee house propaganda\\" and grows increasingly irate at the difficulty of getting a regular cup of coffee. Franklin's homosexuality is implied throughout the series, with acknowledgement after the reboot. He eventually quit working at Starsmucks in an attempt to open his own homosexual-themed coffee shop with Germaine as a business partner, although the blatantness of the coffee shop's theme lead to poor business and his castration by Germaine out of frustration. Mammed Udi is a hard-working Hindu man from India. His jobs include technical support for Smell Tech Computers, an Eaters Anonymous hotline that Germaine calls, a suicide hotline operator, and the pharmacist who supplies Pilz-E's medications. Joanna, or \\"Mutie\\", was Germaine's mute female roommate. She was physically distracting \\"eye candy\\", with blond hair in ponytails, blue eyes, and an exaggerated breast size. She appeared in a number of initially unreleased episodes. In \\"Cute Mute\\", it is revealed that Germaine brought her home from a party because she was drunk, but she decides to room there to help with bills. Joanna's last appearance was in the episode \\"Hot Enough For You?\\", where she is pulled underwater by a mysterious tentacle. However, she appears briefly at the end of the \\"An Arthouse Halloween\\" episode released on October 16, 2012. Jack Partfine is a cryptozoologist from New York who moved to Connecticut because his profession could not cover his expenses. He is good- natured, friendly, and constantly apologizing for the accusations blurted by his dog, Roswell. However, he does appear to be slightly paranoid and a conspiracy theorist. Introduced in the episode \\"Secrets of The Foamy Cult\\", he is the first human introduced since the reboot. Dia is a religious-minded young woman who left India to avoid an arranged marriage to Mammed Udi, and find purpose to her life. She believes she may be hallucinating after she discovers some expired tofu in her fridge that talks and moves. In addition to a cameo appearance in the Neurotically Yours episode \\"Midnight Release\\", Dia had two episodes of her own series with Tofu, called Dia & Tofu. Betty Bo'Qua, aka \\"The Previous Owner\\", is Foamy's owner before Germaine. Against Foamy's advice, Betty performed witchcraft to become a shemale; she drew the ire of demonic spirits and, as a result, must perform an annual ritual if she wants to keep living. She also performs off Broadway from time to time. Ollie is Germaine's grandfather. Ollie took it upon himself to raise Germaine after her father left her and her mother was deemed unfit to parent. Ollie is an old school New York citizen whose years of city-living made him hardened and sarcastic. He appears cold at times, but does his best to raise his granddaughter, even if it means letting her make her own mistakes. Ollie appears solely in the Chibisodes, being introduced in \\"New Phone\\". In the present day, he currently lives in Florida while Germaine house sits his Connecticut house. He has yet to make an appearance in the present day however. Salt Forester is Foamy's new owner, who is introduced in the episode \\"Mail Friend\\". Salt is an aspiring novelist with a scratchy voice who reluctantly takes in Foamy so he can get his P.O. box back after Foamy took up residence. His work is noted to be rather poor by Foamy, and uses waffles as a recurring theme, though Foamy, since first meeting him, has managed to get him to cut down the amount of waffle material Salt has written. Salt and his roommate live in a storage unit, claiming it was the cheapest possible option in New York City. Sue Z. June is Salt's roommate introduced in the episode \\"New Room\\". She is a mute by choice and communicates mostly through texting, otherwise appearing stoic and completely emotionless. Salt says that the only time Sue ever spoke, she said, \\"I don't speak because no one listens.\\" Salt tries to stay on her good side because she has a mean streak and a tendency for tazing other people with little or no provocation, which causes Foamy to take an instant liking to her. Sue has since replaced Germaine as Foamy's verbal foil and musical accompaniment, despite her refusal to react to his ranting.

It has two sections; the main section is a gravel highway that spans approximately from Highway 88 (Bicentennial Highway) near Red Earth Creek to Trout Lake, and a developing freeway section in Fort McMurray which connects Highway 63 with the new neighbourhood of Parsons Creek known as Parsons Access Road. Highway 686 comprises the western segment of the partially constructed Northern Alberta East‚ÄìWest Highway Corridor.  History  Highway 686 used to continue west from Red Earth Creek to the Mackenzie Highway (Highway 35), approximately northwest of Peace River; the highway was renumbered to Highway 986 in the mid-1990s. In 2015, the Parsons Access Road was opened in Fort McMurray which connected Highway 63 to the developing residential neighbourhood Parsons Creek, with interchanges at Highway 63 (known as the Parsons Creek Interchange) and the access road currently referred to as the North Parsons Gateway.  Future   East‚ÄìWest Connector  The Province of Alberta is studying an east‚Äìwest highway connection between Fort McMurray and Red Earth Creek, connecting with Highway 686 north of Peerless Lake. As part of the highway, the Fort McMurray portion would be a short freeway with connections to Parsons Creek and Confederation Way/Thickwood Boulevard. The Parsons Creek Interchange at Highway 63 was staged to accommodate an eastern extension across the Athabasca River.  East Clearwater Highway  Following the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo council unanimously voted in support of a second highway that would serve as an alternate evacuation route tentatively called the \\"East Clearwater Highway\\". It would run east of Fort McMurray as an extension of Highway 881 near Anzac, crossing the Clearwater River and continue north towards Fort MacKay. As part of the project, Highway 686 would continue east across the Athabasca River and connect with the new highway.

In most of the Caribbean, rum cakes are a traditional holiday season dessert, descended from the holiday puddings (such as figgy pudding). Traditionally, dried fruit is soaked in rum for months and then added to dough prepared with sugar which has been caramelized by boiling in water. The result, also known as \\"black cake\\", is similar to a fruitcake, with a lighter texture. In Trinidad and Tobago, fruits are preserved in cherry brandy to be used in the making of black cake. Black cake is traditionally associated with Christmas in Trinidad and Tobago. In Puerto Rico, rum cake is called Bizcocho de Ron, and is a sponge cake, so as to absorb the rum. If fruit is added to it, it is fresh or dried. Raisins and sultanas may be soaked in rum for one day or one night. Bizcochos de Ron are given as gifts during the holiday season. In the United States, rum cakes have been popular since at least the 1970s. While many island travelers go out of their way to pick up a Caribbean variety, more and more small U.S. companies are competing, much the way that craft beers are competing with the large beer manufacturers. Some offer baked- to-order rum cakes. Some infuse the rum directly into their cakes (instead of glazing). Many appear to have a decades-old special recipe. It is possible to become intoxicated from consumption of an excessive amount of rum cake, and some rum cakes contain even more than five percent of certain grain alcohols, though some are made to consistently contain less than 0.5% alcohol. It is typically made with plums and raisins soaked in rum, as well as brown sugar and a bittersweet caramel called \\"browning\\".

He is a native of Oakland, California. Mountaineering Steck started climbing with his brother George. In 1940 when Allen was 14, the two completed the first ascent of the northwest ridge of Mount Maclure (). He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Discharged in 1946, he joined the Rock Climbing Section of the Sierra Club, and began climbing on Berkeley crags such as Indian Rock and Cragmont. He enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in German. His early climbing influences included Dick Leonard and David Brower. He began climbing in Yosemite Valley in 1947, initially learning the use of pitons by trial and error. He said that at that time, there \\"was no body of people who could help you learn these things.\\" He has been a Life Member of the Sierra Club since 1947. In 1949, he climbed in the Alps, completing the first ascent by an American of the Comici route on the north face of the Cima Grande in the Dolomites together with his Austrian friend Karl Lugmayer.Jones, Chris, Climbing in North America, (University of California Press and American Alpine Club, Berkeley, 1976) Sentinel Rock in Yosemite Valley Makalu From June 30 to July 4, 1950, with John Salath√©, he completed the first ascent of Steck-Salath√© Route up the north face of Sentinel Rock in Yosemite Valley.Roper, Steve and Steck, Allen, Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, pp. 243‚Äì8 (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1979) Steck described the climb in an article originally published in the Sierra Club Bulletin in 1951: \\"The ascent of this wall was probably the toughest that either of us had ever made, or ever hoped to make again. Though John has 51 years to my 24, the climb seemed to have little effect on his endurance; only toward the end of the third day, did he seem to show signs of wear, but then both of us were ready to acknowledge the pleasures of simple back country hiking. It was just too damned hot\\". In 1952, he went to work at a Berkeley ski, mountaineering and backpacking store called The Ski Hut, and later worked for their equipment manufacturing division Trailwise. He specialized in sleeping bag design. Steck participated in the first attempt on Makalu in Nepal which was made by an American team led by William Siri in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of members of the Sierra Club and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu. This was the first major American mountaineering expedition to the Himalaya. They attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 m (23,300 ft) by a constant barrage of storms, as well as food shortages and lack of bottled oxygen. On June 22, 1963, he completed the first ascent of the Southeast Face of Clyde Minaret () with Dick Long, John Evans and Chuck Wilts.Roper, Steve and Steck, Allen, Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, pp. 288‚Äì93 (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1979) On August 6, 1965, he completed the first ascent of Hummingbird Ridge on Mount Logan () in the St. Elias Range located on the border between the Yukon and Alaska, a climb that took 35 days. The climb has never been repeated, despite numerous attempts, and is considered among of the most challenging climbs in mountaineering history for that reason. Mount Logan is the second-highest peak in North America. He was accompanied to the summit by Dick Long, John Evans, Jim Wilson, Frank Coale and Paul Bacon.Roper, Steve and Steck, Allen, Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, pp. 37‚Äì41 (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1979) In 1969, he co-founded Mountain Travel with Leo LeBon.

In July, 1970, Steck and Doug Robinson completed the first ascent of the \\"Doors of Perception\\" route on North Palisade rated III 5.8, described as \\"the most striking feature on the northeast face of the mountain\\" and \\"one of the most aesthetic lines in the Sierra.\\" Along with Steve Roper, he has been the long- time editor of the mountaineering journal Ascent, which was originally published by the Sierra Club and later by the American Alpine Club. Steck and Roper also wrote the book Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, first published in 1979. Legacy Jointly with Norman Clyde, he was the first recipient of the Sierra Club's Francis P.

His nickname is \\"the Silver Fox.\\" Allen celebrated his 75th birthday by meeting up with a large group of friends at Red Rocks, climbing classics like the Crimson Crysalis, Lotta Balls and the chimneys of Epinephrine. Allen also gave a slide show at Desert Rock Sports of the first ascent of the Hummingbird Ridge of Mt. Logan - slides that had been in storage since the early 1960s.

In 1963, she was transferred to Mexico, where she served as ARM California (H03/B-3). She was wrecked in 1972. Construction and commissioning Belet was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Belet (DE-599) on 26 January 1944 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 3 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Eleanor J. Belet, the widow of the ships namesake, Master Technical Sergeant Robert A. Belet. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley- class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-109 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 15 June 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Albert P. Merrill in command.  Service history  After taking on stores, Belet got underway on 3 July 1945 for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for four weeks of shakedown training. Following shakedown, she stood out of Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 August 1945 with a full load of passengers, bound for World War II service in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The next day while at sea, the ship received the news of the surrender of Japan, but she continued on to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 27 August 1945. On 1 September 1945, Belet departed San Diego and set course for the Mariana Islands. She stopped at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, only long enough to take on fuel and provisions and then touched briefly at Eniwetok Atoll before arriving at Saipan on 17 September 1945. Belet operated out of Saipan, shuttling troops as needed and providing escort and lifeguard services. Belet left the Marianas on 8 October 1945 and headed for occupation duty in Japan. On 11 October 1945, she relieved the United States Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Taney (WPG-37) as port director ship at Wakayama, Japan. Belet remained at this station until ordered back to the United States in December 1945. On her homeward voyage, Belet carried returning servicemen into San Diego in January 1946 and was then ordered back to the United States East Coast. Following repairs at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, she steamed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, for inactivation. Decommissioning and disposal Belet was decommissioned on 22 May 1946 and placed in reserve with the Green Cove Springs Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. After over 17 years of inactivity, she was declared excess to the needs of the U.S. Navy, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 12 December 1963. Mexican Navy service Sold to Mexico on 12 December 1963, Belet became ARM California (H03) in the Mexican Navy. She was later assigned the new pennant number of B03. California ran aground on the Bahia Peninsula on 16 January 1972 broadside to the beach, and was judged unsalvageable. Abandoned, her hulk broke up on the rocks.

He won six other stakes races that year and was retroactively recognized as the American Champion three-year-old colt. He was later the sire of Zev and Flying Ebony, the respective winners of the 1923 and 1925 Kentucky Derbies. The Finn was the leading sire in North America of 1923. Background The Finn was foaled in Lexington, Kentucky at Hamburg Place, the stud farm of John E. Madden. The Finn was sired by the imported British stallion Ogden, who was the 1896 Belmont Futurity Stakes winner, out of the mare Livonia by Star Shoot.Avalyn Hunter. American Classic Pedigrees: 1914-2002. Blood-Horse Publications. 2003. The Finn originally ran for Madden as a homebred. He was sold in May 1915 to Harry C. Hallenbeck in a package deal with another horse for $35,000. He was trained by Edward Heffner. Racing Career The Finn won three of nine starts at age two. His stand-out performance came in a maiden race at Aqueduct when he set a track record of :59 for five furlongs. He also won two handicaps that year. However, he did not finish in the Belmont Futurity because he threw his rider. 1915: three-year-old season At age three, The Finn won nine of twenty starts, and also finished second four times. In addition to winning the 1915 Belmont Stakes, he won the Withers, Southampton Handicap, Hamilton Derby, Huron Handicap, Baltimore Handicap, Ellicott City Handicap, Dixie Handicap and Manhattan Handicap. The Finn was not ready to run in the 1915 Kentucky Derby in early May, but on May 29 was the second betting choice in the fortieth running of the Withers Stakes, then one of the most important races of the American racing calendar. He went to the lead and won \\"in a great, big gallop\\" by two lengths. In the Belmont Stakes on June 4, only three horses ran after Derby winner Regret bypassed the race. The Finn led from the start and was never seriously challenged. On June 15, he established himself as the best three-year-old of the crop, with the possible exception of Regret, by winning the Southampton Handicap while conceding from four to 28 pounds to his rivals. This time he trailed the early pace set by Garbage, then started his move on the backstretch and took command turning for home. Over the summer and autumn, The Finn won several more times. However, he was unexpectedly beaten in the Knickerbocker Handicap, a defeat that led to the temporary suspension of Heffner's training license. 1916: four-year-old season The Finn earned his first win as a four-year-old on May 26 in the Metropolitan Handicap. He rated behind the fast early pace set by High Noon and Stromboli, then closed in the final furlong to win by half a length to the cheers of the crowd. The Finn was so full of run that he could not be pulled up for half a mile. The Finn won five more stakes races that year, including his second win in the Manhattan Handicap. Despite carrying top weight of 130 pounds, he won easily by lengths. In late September, he finished his campaign with two wins at Havre de Grace in one week. After he beat Roamer in the Havre de Grace Handicap, The New York Times called him the best four-year-old in the country. He won six of twelve that starts that year, conceding weight in all of them. At age five, The Finn's only win came in the Long Beach Handicap at Jamaica, where he equaled the track record for 9 furlongs of 1:52. Stud Career The Finn was the sire of either 16 or 17 stakes winners from 130 or 134 named foals, depending on the source. This included two Classic winning sons, Zev and Flying Ebony. He also sired Kai-Sang (Jerome Handicap, Lawrence Realization), Bud Lerner (Youthful Stakes) and Finite. Though not generally successful as a broodmare sire, his daughter Khara established a successful family that included important sires Habitat. The Finn died in September 1925 at the age of thirteen, siring 143 foals. Although several of his sons were useful sires, his last successful tail-male descendant was the short-lived Puerto Rican racehorse Camarero, who set the record for the most consecutive victories (56) for a Thoroughbred racehorse in 1955.

Plot summary 15-year-old Mandy Underwood returns home from summer camp to find she no longer feels a connection to her friends and family. After spending a summer playing tennis and meeting new people, she no longer shares the shallow interests of the vapid friends of her small Rhode Island town. She feels most changed by the time she spent with the camp's Equestrian program. Now that she considers herself an adept rider, Mandy feels superior to her former friends Lydia, Patricia, and Elaine. In an effort to win back her affections, Mandy's parents, Lloyd and Melody, decide to purchase a horse for Mandy. Mandy accepts their offer, but only on the condition that she can select the horse herself. After visiting a number of stables, Mandy fails to find a horse that meets her standards. Lydia, Patricia, and Elaine try to show their support by throwing a horse-themed party for Mandy and even give her an expensive saddle to celebrate the occasion. Finally, after months of searching, Mandy finds an ideal horse on a farm in New Hampshire. While visiting the farm, she meets Ted, the horse's current owner. Ted quickly informs Mandy that he has no patience for her superior attitude. Mandy finds Ted intriguing and they begin a long-distance relationship, writing each other daily letters. Mandy even names her horse Teddy in his honor. Unfortunately, after six months of dating, Mandy discovers that Ted has a serious illness that he has kept secret from her. He suffers from salivary gland cancer, a disease with which he was diagnosed after years of tobacco use. Although Ted quit using chewing tobacco following his diagnosis, the damage was already severe. Mandy and Ted continue their relationship over the next three years until Ted ultimately succumbs to the effects of his disease. After his funeral, Mandy's friends Lydia, Patricia, and Elaine again extend an offer of friendship, but Mandy knows that they can never ease her suffering.

Gameplay The goal of most levels is to absorb enough motes to become the largest on the level. The aim of the game is to propel oneself, a single-celled organism (\\"Mote\\"), into other smaller motes to absorb them. Colliding with a mote larger than the player will cause the player to be absorbed, resulting in a game over. Motes smaller than the player are blue, while motes bigger than the player are red. Changing course is done by expelling mass. Due to conservation of momentum, this results in the player's mote moving away from the expelled mass, but also in one's own mote shrinking. There are three different \\"zones\\" of levels in Osmos: In the \\"sentient\\" levels, the goal is to prevail over active motes of various types that hunt and absorb other motes, including the player. Hunting them typically involves absorbing as many inactive motes as possible before chasing down the active ones with the extra mass one has gained. In the \\"ambient\\" levels, the player's mote typically floats in a large area surrounded by inactive motes, and must become the largest or simply very large. Variations on this theme involve, for instance, starting the game as a very small mote surrounded by many larger, fast moving motes, or the presence of \\"antimatter\\" motes which shrink normal motes during collision no matter which one was originally bigger, or starting the game stuck in a huge, densely packed area with a large number of other motes without much space to move about and having to nudge other motes out of the way by ejecting mass at them. In the \\"force\\" levels, special motes (\\"Attractors\\") influence other motes with a force similar to gravitation. The player has to take into account orbital physics when planning movement in order to save mass when changing course. In these levels, the game optionally assists the player with a course trajectory tool that plots the mote's course, up to a short time in the future. Force levels are complicated in various ways, including levels with mutually repelling attractors, attractors bouncing randomly around an area full of motes, several \\"strata\\" of bodies in retrograde rotation about an attractor, and attractors orbiting other attractors. On June 25, 2012 Hemisphere Games announced the release of a multiplayer version of Osmos for iOS on the company blog and from the game's Facebook Page for July 19, 2012. Reception Osmos received generally favorable reviews with a score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 22 critic reviews. At IndieCade in 2009, Osmos was named \\"Best in Show\\" and won the Fun/Compelling award. Apple Inc. selected Osmos as the iPad game of the year for 2010. It also won many other awards that year.best-games-of-september-2009 on gametunnel.com (September 2009) IGN awarded Osmos its best video game soundtrack of 2010.

The hymnal contains hymns translated into Tagalog which are mainly used by the different Evangelical Churches in the Philippines. The latest revision was headed by Dr. Emilia Reysio-Cruz, one of the leading figures in Philippine folk music. Features According to its own Preface,Mga Awit sa Pagsamba, National Council of Churches in the Philippines 2007 the hymnal contains 300 Pilipino (not Tagalog nor Filipino) songs which are used by the Evangelical Churches in the Philippines in different kinds of services. One of the main task that needed to be done in the 2007 edition was the thorough revision of some of the popular hymns. When the hymnal was first published in 1959, the Protestant Churches were just budding churches headed mostly by American missionaries. Thus, it could just be expected that their hold of the Philippine languages were not as perfect as the natives. And in case that there were some natives who helped in the translation, the appreciation of Tagalog during that time is not the same at the present. Because of this, some of the popular hymn were reworded to better suit the theology that it teaches. Another problem of the earlier hymnals was that because they are translations of some of the popular hymns, the translators tried to be as faithful to the words of the original hymn to the expense of putting the wrong stress at the wrong syllable.Mga Awit sa Pagsamba, Preface (pharagraph 3), National Council of Churches in the Philippines 2007 Also, some of the translations remained ver faithful to the original form that some of the hymns already lost their sense in Tagalog. The hymnal also tried to avoid the inclusion of songs used for evangelistic meetings and rallies so as to preserve the sacredness of the music that is meant for worship.Mga Awit sa Pagsamba, Preface (pharagraph 4), National Council of Churches in the Philippines 2007 The Working Committee True to its aim of being interdenominational, the working committee included people from the different Evangelical Churches in the Philippines namely:Mga Awit sa Pagsamba, Acknowledgements, National Council of Churches in the Philippines 2007 #Emilia Reysio-Cruz - Chair of the Committee #Teodosia Cruz - Methodist Church #Ptr.

It generally runs north-south from Range Road 162 near the Hamlet of Rainier, through the City of Brooks to Highway 550 in Village of Duchess.  Route description  Highway 873 is a two-lane undivided highway in the County of Newell that begins as an east-west route at the intersection of Range Road 162 and Township Road 164, west of Rainer. It travels east to the intersection of Highway 36 where it becomes a gravel highway and continues east along the south end of Lake Newell to Highway 535, where it turns north and continues towards Kinbrook Island Provincial Park, where at the park entrance it once again becomes a paved highway. Highway 873 continues north where it enters Brooks along 7 Street E where it follows a series of city streets, a short concurrency with Highway 542, and leaves Brooks along 2 Street W, the city's main commercial strip. It crosses the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) at the city's northern boundary and continues north past Highway 544 to Duchess where it ends at the intersection of Highway 550\\\\. The roadway continues north as Range Road 144.  History  The section of Highway 873 between Brooks and Duchess has had multiple designations in its history. Along with Highway 550, the route was originally designated as part of Highway 2, which at the time was an east-west inter-provincial highway that ran through Calgary and Medicine Hat (the present-day Highway 2 was designated as Highway 1). In 1941, Highway 2 was renumbered to Highway 1 to allow for continual numbering through Western Canada along the future Trans-Canada Highway, which was commissioned in 1949. In the mid-1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was realigned between Brooks and Bassano, resulting in the Duchess- Bassano section being decommissioned and the Brooks-Duchess section becoming part of Highway 36. In the 1970s, Highway 36 north was realigned to align with the Highway 1/36 (south) junction located west of Brooks, resulting in the Brooks-Duchess section becoming Highway 873.

Description The Synodus dermatogenys is found in a marine environment within a reef-associated depth range of about 1‚Äì70 meters. This species is native to a tropical climate. The maximum recorded length of the Synodus dermatogenys as an unsexed male is about 24 centimeters or about 9.44 inches. It can be identified by the five or six red-brown vertical bars that intersect a red horizontal broken band on the flank, immediately below this band is a line of whitish dots although the colours can vary depending on the surroundings. This species is native to the areas of Indo-Pacific, Red Sea, Hawaiian, Line, Marquesan, Tuamoto islands, north to Ryukyu Islands, south to Lord Howe, Micronesia, Southeast Atlantic, Algoa Bay, and South Africa. It is common to find this species in sand-rubble areas of lagoon and seaward reefs to over 20 meters of benthic depth. This species buries itself in the sand while exposing its eyes and nostrils. It is known to find this species solitary or in small groups. Sand lizardfish is a predator of small fish and crustaceans, its mouth is full of sharp needle-like teeth. Sand lizardfish exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when illuminated by blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence may assist in intraspecific communication and camouflage. Taxonomy For several years, the name Synodus variegatus was misapplied to S. dermatogenys, while the true S. variegatus was referred to as S. englemani Schultz, 1953 by many authors, including Cressey (1981).CRESSEY, R. 198I. Revision of the Indo-West Pacific lizardfishes of the genus Synodus (Pisces: Synodontidae). Smithson. Contrib. Zool. 342: I-53. However, Waples and Randall (1989) showed that S. variegatus is a senior synonym of S. englemani, and that S. dermatogenys is the correct name for the lizardfish that Cressey (1981) identified as S. variegatus.WAPLES, R.

Sonia King is currently creating VisionShift, a site- specific mosaic installation for Hall Arts Plaza in the Dallas Arts District. Biography King creates contemporary, abstract mosaic art with a complex variety of tesserae, working with spacing, reflectivity and texture. The rich surface offers continued visual interest as new relationships are noticed even after extensive viewing. All the pieces are cut by hand, without power tools. While some large scale installations (like Nebula Chroma) are grouted using a multi-colored 'fresco grout' technique that King developed, her fine art mosaics are not grouted. This allows each tessera to retain its own identity, revealing more by emphasizing shadows and negative space. \\"Mosaic is hard. Art is harder. Creating with a broad range of materials raises the complexity beyond just cutting a piece to fit. I work to get every tessera right while managing its relationship to the next piece and the one before, all the time considering the work as a whole.

Background and prospects at St Cyprian‚Äôs in 1905 Canon Robson came to St Cyprian's Church in 1905, a Parish still worshiping in a wood and iron church in Jones Street, Kimberley, a structure imported as a prefabricated kit from England in 1879. Grand plans for a new church had been proposed in a public meeting in 1901, but little progress had been made towards their realisation. Í∞ïÎÇ®Í±¥Îßà Archdeacon William Arthur Holbech, who had been Rector at the time, had gone on to become Dean of Bloemfontein. Robson's predecessor, Archdeacon H.A. Douglas-Hamilton, was appointed in 1903, encountering an impatient faction within the congregation who additionally were at odds with the Archdeacon's churchmanship ‚Äì specifically with respect to liturgical practices. This faction removed itself from the parish, building its own brick church of St John the Evangelist in Woodley Street ‚Äì a parish of decidedly low church persuasion. Prospects for the new rector could hardly have seemed less auspicious. Robson‚Äôs achievement And yet Thomas Claude Robson, presiding over the parish for very nearly three decades, would oversee perhaps the greatest transformation in the history of St Cyprian's: the design of a cathedral; the completion of the first two major phases of this long-term project; and the building up of a mother church for a new and vast diocese. St Cyprian's would no longer simply be a parish church. A newspaper feature in 1923, on ‚ÄòMen in the Public Eye‚Äô, pronounced: ‚ÄúHe is the Dean of Kimberley and Kimberley loves its Dean.‚Äù Milestones of Robson‚Äôs Kimberley career * 5 March 1907 ‚Äì the foundation stone for what would soon become St Cyprian's Cathedral was laid by Bishop William Thomas Gaul of Mashonaland. ‚ÄúConsiderable anxiety was expressed by many even unconnected with the Anglican Church,‚Äù reported the local press, ‚Äúthat the building to be erected should be worthy of the great place it will in all probability occupy as the future Cathedral of the Diocese of Griqualand West and Bechuanaland.‚Äù * 13 May 1908 ‚Äì the dedication of the first part of the cathedral building, the nave, by the Vicar General from Bloemfontein, the Ven Archdeacon J. R. Vincent, assisted by Kimberley's Archdeacon Weekes and the Rector, T.C. Robson. ‚ÄòAchieved is the glorious work‚Äô, from Haydn's Creation, was sung as an anthem at Festal Evensong that evening, when an augmented choir was accompanied by an orchestra under direction of St Cyprian's organist Mr Sidney H. Rees. * 11 October 1911 ‚Äì Episcopal Synod, meeting in Pietermaritzburg consented to the formation of a Kimberley Diocese. * 30 June 1912 ‚Äì Bishop Wilfrid Gore Browne enthroned as 1st Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman at St Cyprian's Cathedral. * With the elevation of St Cyprian's to Cathedral status, its Rector, Canon T.C. Robson, was invited to become the first Dean of Kimberley. Initially he was incapacitated by illness and, by default, Bishop Gore Browne was closely involved in the parish, and for a time kept it going single-handed. The building up of the Cathedral as a unifying symbol of the diocese was part of Robson's vision: he believed, as he put it in the Cathedral News in 1916, that ‚Äúif the Cathedral suffers the whole Diocese suffers, but if the Cathedral prospers the whole Diocese prospers.‚Äù * 22 September 1913 ‚Äì the second major phase of work towards the completion of the cathedral building was launched when the Governor General laid the Foundation Stone for the Choir and Sanctuary. Looking still further ahead, a tower fund was established in 1914 ‚Äî though nearly half a century more would elapse before the tower was built. * 1914 ‚Äì the outbreak of the Great War had a profound impact in Kimberley. There was an exodus of young men‚Äîtoo many of them never to return. The Kimberley mines were closed. Then, in 1918, the deadly influenza epidemic devastated the city. When work on the Chancel eventually was taken up again after the war, it came to be dedicated as a memorial to those of the parish who had died in the war. The magnificent soaring windows set high up at the back of the nave, at the west end of the Cathedral, were erected to the memory of one of the parish's sons, Lieut William Newby, R.A.F., killed in action in France in 1918, and buried at Rejet-de-Beaulieu. The high altar bears an inscription to another serviceman, Geoffrey Selwyn Brown, who made it back from the war but died soon after from scarlet fever. An unusual inscription is that on the altar rail (so well polished that it is now barely visible), in memory of Leonard George Sherriff, who died in 1925. Sherriff had won a prestigious scholarship to train as an engineer in the Royal Navy, and he served in the Great War, becoming involved in pioneering submarine experiments. He caught a chill at Gibraltar in 1924, from which he never recovered, and he died, aged 26, at his parents‚Äô residence in Kimberley. * 4 December 1926 ‚Äì the Chancel of the Cathedral was dedicated by the Archbishop of Cape Town, The Most Revd William Marlborough Carter. * 15 March 1928 ‚Äì Bishop Wilfrid Gore Browne died. Three windows in the apse, depicting the Archangels Raphael, Michael and Gabriel, were dedicated to his memory. A window depicting the bishop himself was set above the choir in 1988, with a dedication to all founders and benefactors. * 1933 ‚Äì Dean Robson commissioned the carving of a pulpit which would be a memorial to his predecessor as Rector, and later Bishop of Mashonaland, William Thomas Gaul ‚Äî who had laid the foundation stone of the Cathedral in 1907. * 10 September 1934 ‚Äì Thomas Claude Robson died in Kimberley. More than 2000 people attended the funeral: 300-400 cars went to the cemetery. In one of many tributes, Kimberley's Rabbi Konviser ‚Äî who remembered receiving greetings from the Dean ‚Äúwritten in most scholarly and correct Hebrew phraseology‚Äù ‚Äî admired Robson as a man ‚Äúfree from cant and prejudice,‚Äù to be ‚Äúremembered by men of all creeds‚Äù. Í∞ïÎÇ®Ïπ¥ÏßÄÎÖ∏ His death marked the close of a remarkable era in the history of St Cyprian's Cathedral.

Plot summary Seventeen-year-old Juno Marlowe is in love with Jonty and Francis and has just waved them off to war (World War II when the air raid sirens sound across London. Juno finds shelter in the house of a stranger, the frail Evelyn Copplestone. Juno spends the night with Evelyn and tells him the story of her life, and Evelyn decides to help her by writing her a letter of introduction to his family in the West Country. Evelyn, who is ill, dies of lungfailure due to gas in World War I during the night, and Juno flees the house. Reluctant to join her mother who has emigrated to Canada, and having nowhere else to go, Juno soon finds herself on her way to the West Country to see Evelyn's family at a farm named Copplestone. The owner of the farm, Robert Copplestone, Evelyn's father and only relative, is short of labour and hires Juno as a landgirl. Shortly after her arrival at Copplestone, Juno, to her surprise, finds out that she is pregnant. When her mother in Canada hears that Juno has given birth to a pair of illegitimate twins, the social embarrassment makes her break off any further contact with her daughter. Juno is left to fend for herself and the hard work at the farm helps her to blot out any unwelcome memories of her past. Gradually she learns to trust the other people at Copplestone, and the withdrawn and quiet Juno grows into an independent and determined woman, who is more than merely part of the furniture.

The church arose out of a Sunday school and youth club by Mr Dyer, who cycled weekly from the Somerdale Factory in Keynsham to run the clubs. Mr Dyer lived above the Church until his death in 1967. His sister continued living there until her subsequent death. The church was named ‚ÄúHebron‚Äù because an aim was for it to be a ‚Äúplace of refuge‚Äù. During the 1930s and 1940s, Dr Vernon Charley, who developed the blackcurrant drink Ribena whilst at the Long Ashton Research Station, was the organist and an Elder of the Church. During the 1950s, Roger T Forster, founder of Ichthus Christian Fellowship was a regular preacher whilst doing National Service with the RAF. The Church continues to thrive and membership currently stands at around 30 with an average Sunday morning congregation of around 50. Evening services are smaller with an average of around 15 attendees. Hebron is an exciting mixture of people from varied backgrounds:- Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Salvation Army, Anglican and Roman Catholic. Ages range from the cradle to the 90s. Children's and youth work continues with regular groups for all ages including \\"God's Gang\\" and a Friday night kid's club. As a church we want to grow in our relationship with God and to invite other people to discover Him for themselves. We believe that God revealed Himself in the life of Jesus to make all this possible. We aim to be a church where all people can feel welcome and can know that they 'belong'.

Biography Born in Gladstone, Michigan, Smith left home in his teens with the dream of working in films. Not having any money, he made his way across country to Hollywood by hitching rides illegally on freight trains. After some time of living as a hobo, he finally reached Hollywood in 1930. Smith eventually was hired on as an animator at the Fleischer Studios in the late 1930s. He worked on several feature films with that studio, including Gulliver's Travels (1939) and various short films including Popeye cartoons and Betty Boop. He then joined UPA studios, working alongside Robert Cannon, John Hubley and others. His films at UPA included the Oscar-winning Gerald McBoing-Boing (1951). For three years Smith directed and produced films in Paris, France, for Cineaste Productions, winning many awards. His work in the 1960s included commercials and short films for Playhouse Pictures, followed by a long association with director/producer Bill Melendez, animating many of the Peanuts television specials including A Charlie Brown Christmas, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and the feature films A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy Come Home.

His projects included the St. Louis Gateway Arch, Seagram Building and Madison Square Garden.. Background Fred N. Severud was born Fridtjov Nikolai S√¶verud in Bergen, Norway. He was the son of Herman S√¶verud (1861‚Äì1931) and Cecilie Tvedt (1869‚Äì1956). His father was a businessman and owner of a margarine factory in Bergen. His parents encouraged their children to attend college.Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers, Richard Weingardt, ASCE Press, 2005 Severud had two brothers and nine sisters. One brother, Harald S√¶verud, gained recognition as a modern classical composer. Another brother, Bjarne S√¶verud (1892-1978), would be active within the Norwegian Resistance during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany during World War II and serve as a representative in the Norwegian Parliament from Bergen (1945 - 1949) Severud attended the Bergen Cathedral School and later studied at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. In 1923, Severud emigrated to the United States, entering through Ellis Island. Shortly thereafter, Severud started work for an engineering company, where he was rapidly promoted.Fred N. Severud Memorial Tributes (National Academy of Engineering, Volume 5 (1992)], National Academy of Engineering (NAE), article by Anton Tedesk) Career Severud utilized the experience he gained in his early years of designing successful housing projects. In 1928 he founded an engineering consultancy in Manhattan called Severud-Elstad-Krueger Associates, renamed twenty years later as Severud-Perrone-Sturm-Bandel, and now known as Severud Associates. He also lectured and was the author of several books and articles on architectural and engineering subjects. Along with Joseph H. Abel (1905-1985), he wrote one of the industry‚Äôs first comprehensive books, Apartment Houses (Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1947) on how to best design, build and operate apartment ventures. A few years later, as one of the few structural engineers in the world to have analyzed the forces from and the effects of atomic bombs, together with Anthony F. Merrill he wrote a textbook on protection from nuclear explosions called The Bomb, Survival and You (Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1954).

Ala. 1998), was a legal case involving affirmative action, that was decided in a United States Federal Court. This was the first case filed by an African American student to challenge the existing race-based affirmative action admission policy at Alabama State University (ASU) in Montgomery, Alabama. In Tompkins, four black applicants who had been rejected for the Alabama State University white-only scholarship program filed suit to challenge the institution's admissions policy on equal protection grounds, and their case prevailed. To Tompkins, the issue was a simple one: \\"They said I have to be white and I can't be.\\" \\"It's strange,\\" says Tompkins. \\"You have a historically black institution giving scholarships to whites to remedy discrimination.\\"June Kronholz, The Wall Street Journal, \\"Double Reverse Scholarship Program for Whites Becomes a Test of Preferences\\". 23 December 1997, p. 1 History The Knight litigation Knight v. Alabama commenced on January 15, 1981, when John F. Knight Jr., and a class of other alumni, students, and faculty members of Alabama State University (ASU) filed suit in the Northern District of Alabama to attack alleged vestiges of segregation in public higher education. The court held two trials, resulting in the 1991 Knight I opinion and 1995 Knight II opinion. The Tompkins litigation White-Only Scholarship Brochure used by ASU to recruit white student only. The university awarded 40% of its budget for academic grants to whites. Tompkins posing in front of U.S. Federal Court House Montgomery, Alabama On October 1, 1997, Plaintiffs Jessie Tompkins, Audra Beasley, James W. Scott, and Rodney Smith filed the Tompkins lawsuit on behalf of all non-white individuals similarly situated to Plaintiffs.Tompkins v. Alabama State University, 97-M-1482-S (N.D. Ala. 1998).Malcolm Daniel, The Montgomery Advertiser, Student Fights College Program, ASU Scholarship Program Gains National Attention. 9 January 1998, p. B-1 The plaintiffs were influenced by Hopwood v. Texas, which was the first successful legal challenge to a university's affirmative action policy in student admissions since Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.. In the Plaintiff's second amended complaint, the plaintiffs outlined class action grounds to eliminate the scholarship's race requirement. The Plaintiffs presented themselves as non-represented black citizens of the State of Alabama, and thus are members of the class certified in the Knight litigation. Plaintiffs claim that the \\"other-race\\" scholarships created at Alabama State pursuant to the Court's 1995 Decree in Knight II violate their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the rights guaranteed by 42 U. S. C. Sections 2000d, 1981 and 1983 of the Civil Rights Act. The Plaintiffs named as Defendants the State of Alabama, ASU, the ASU Board of Trustees, and various ASU administrators. The Plaintiffs sought to certify this case as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Parts 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3). On May 1, 1998, Judge Harold Lloyd Murphy dismissed the Thompson case without prejudice, holding that Tompkins should be permitted to intervene in the ongoing Knight litigation rather than pursue a separate claim. The Eleventh Circuit summarily affirmed Judge Murphy's decision, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Subsequent developments In August 2000, the University and Tompkins failed to settle the case. Tompkins rejected the proposed settlement because he believed that it allowed the University to change the language of the scholarship program's literature, without actually altering who would receive scholarships.Montgomery Advertiser, \\"Discrimination Lawsuit against ASU Likely to end in Courtroom\\". 8 August 2000, p. B-1 Although it was not resolved, the case raised pivotal questions: Should publicly funded historically Black universities offer (to other races) scholarships to diversify their institutions? And, will other-race scholarships guide historically Black universities away from their historical mission?  See also  * Dixon v.

After spending much of his career in Spain's lower divisions with Conquense, Polideportivo Ejido and Huesca, he achieved promotion to La Liga with Granada in 2011, moving to Athletic Bilbao two years later. He amassed totals of 200 matches and 15 goals in the top division over eight seasons before returning to Huesca in summer 2019. Club career Early years Born in Arrigorriaga, Biscay, Rico was schooled in football at local clubs CD Padura and Danok Bat CF as a child. He then joined the ranks of neighbouring CD Basconia, which acted as a farm team of Athletic Bilbao; in April 2001 he appeared as a late substitute in one Tercera Divisi√≥n match, where Joseba Arriaga and Andoni Iraola also featured. Rico moved to UB Conquense in 2003. Most of the first season was spent in their reserves, but the second, also in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, saw him feature regularly, attracting the attention of Polideportivo Ejido who signed him in 2005. Rico was loaned back to Conquense for 2005‚Äì06, which ended in relegation from the third level. He made his debut as a professional with Ejido in the following campaign, making 20 league appearances before being loaned out again, to SD Huesca. In 2007‚Äì08, Rico helped Huesca achieve promotion to division two via the play-offs. Afterwards, he returned to the Estadio Municipal Santo Domingo for one more season, still in the third tier. Huesca / Granada In summer 2009, Rico was signed permanently by Huesca. On 19 June 2010, he scored one of his five goals during the campaign in a 1‚Äì0 away win against RC Celta de Vigo, being crucial as the Aragonese finally avoided relegation. Rico joined fellow league side Granada CF on 31 August 2010, for ‚Ç¨600,000 on a four-year deal. He posted similar individual numbers in his first year ‚Äì 40 matches, two goals, nearly 3,500 minutes of action ‚Äì and his team returned to La Liga after more than three decades via the play- offs; he displayed versatility in the process, featuring in several positions. Rico made his debut in the top flight on 27 August 2011 at nearly 27 years of age, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0‚Äì1 derby home loss against Real Betis. He scored his first goal in the competition on 31 October, contributing to a 2‚Äì1 success at Sevilla FC through a 90th-minute strike; during his spell, he played as a box-to-box midfielder as well as a defensive one. Athletic Bilbao Rico joined Athletic Bilbao in late August 2013, penning a three- year deal with a ‚Ç¨35 million buyout clause. He played his first game with his new team on 1 September, the first half of a 1‚Äì3 away defeat to Real Madrid; he featured in 94 matches in all competitions over his first two season ‚Äì starting the vast majority ‚Äì including all of his team's matches in the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Champions League campaign, and culminating in the final defeat to FC Barcelona for the Copa del Rey. Thereafter, he was used less frequently by head coach Ernesto Valverde, appearing in 30 fixtures during 2015‚Äì16 and 23 during 2016‚Äì17 but often as a late substitute. Under Jos√© √Ångel Ziganda in 2017‚Äì18, it appeared Rico's spell at the club was coming to an end as he made no league appearances at all in the first portion of the campaign after recovering from some physical issues, even as the new coach tried out various squad members to find the optimal personnel for his tactics. However, after finally being introduced to the team from the bench during a match against Villarreal CF (1‚Äì1) on 19 November 2017, shortly after his 33rd birthday, he became a regular starter again, playing the entirety of the next eight league matches and two in the Europa League in which Athletic remained undefeated. On 2 February 2018, 33-year-old Rico signed a contract extension running until June 2019. In early 2019, it was announced that he would leave at the end of the season when that contract ended. The club's final home match involved tributes to him, as well as fellow long-serving squad members Ander Iturraspe and Markel Susaeta who were also departing in similar circumstances. Return to Huesca On 7 July 2019, Rico returned to Huesca as a free agent. International career Rico never earned any caps for Spain at any level. He did feature for the unofficial Basque Country regional team.

Electric Torque Wrench on a calibration stand, wired to a computer via an infrared cable. An electric torque wrench is a planetary torque multiplier or a \\"gearbox\\" mated to a brushless electric motor. At the end of the \\"gearbox\\" is a reaction device that is used to absorb the torque. This allows the operator of the tool to use the electric torque wrench with very little effort. These tools are primarily used anywhere accurate torque is required on a nut and bolt, or where a stubborn nut needs to be removed. These planetary torque multiplier gearboxes have multiplication ratios up to 4000:1. The correct torque output is adjusted by controlling the voltage. The tool has an internal computer that shuts off the voltage at a certain level that is adjusted by the operator of the tool. Because of the internal electronics, the electric torque wrench can operate from 110 or 220 volts. It can adjust in an instant up to 253 volts. Since the tool is operated by electricity, there is a waterproof version of the electric torque wrench available. One benefit of the electric torque wrench is that it plugs into any wall outlet. Also, it runs virtually silently. The electric torque wrench is sometimes confused with a standard impact wrench, because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric torque wrench is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. This is why an electric torque wrench has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy. The electric torque wrench was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic. Electric torque wrenches have different models capable of 65Nm up to a max of 42,160Nm.

The courthouse once housed two separate court systems, one being the James City County Court, responsible for carrying out county cases, and the other, the Hustings Court, responsible for the city cases. The courthouse was built with red bricks with white wooden trim-boards and long arched windows with white shutters. A projected portico is located over one of the entrances and is unique in Georgian architecture. The hipped roof rests on an entablature with dentil moldings. The roof is pierced on both sides by a chimney and a central octagonal drum capped with a dome and a spire. The courthouse was the site where Benjamin Waller read aloud the Declaration of Independence on July 25, 1776, after it arrived from Philadelphia.

The park is in area and has 214 camping sites which are composed of a \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" campground, and one cabin. The north campground has larger lots, which can accommodate larger trailers than the south campground. There is a six-mile (10 km) nature trail, as well as picnic areas, beach with boat rentals, and a camp store. The recreation area lies around Lake Minnewanna, an man-made lake.  History  In its first stages, Metamora-Hadley was laid out differently from today. The original beach was where the current north campground is, and the present-day beach was forest. The drive behind the campground host spot was the original location of the dumping station. Lake Minnewanna was made by damming the creek that flows through the area.

Born  Official logo of Aujac Aujac (Associaci√≥ d'Usuaris de Java de Catalunya) born with the initial proposal to bring near the new information technologies to the people. An effort made through one of the most active Java Users Groups in Europe. AUJAC starts to forge as an idea during the celebration of a Java course and after the initial creation of the JUG of Sabadell by Jordi Pujol Ulied, founder and president of the Aujac, in April of year 2000. The interest was very high and soon summoned a first meeting for establishing the statutes and the first Board of Directors. The meetings occurs often and with an important collective effort that it is it could make patent in the several encounters that they were made in the current headquarters of the entity, in Sabadell. The members founding of AUJAC was: ::Jordi Pujol Ulied (president) ::Xavier Pi i Palom√©s (underpresident) ::Marc Munill i Bernandich (secretary) ::Josep Folch i Serra (treasurer) ::German Munuera Pubill (vowel) ::M√≤nica Rayo Moragon (vowel) ::Albert Soler i Crosas (vowel) ::Pere Brugue i Pujol At the end of year 2000, was constituted and recognized by the Generalitat de Catalunya, and being inscribed in the \\"Registre General d'Entitats Jur√≠diques\\" with number of inscription: 23889 / B On the other hand, the AUJAC was recognized by Sun MicroSystems as official JUG of Catalonia. And in year 2003 the AUJAC becomes the most important 16√© JUG of the world: Top25 JUG Program.  Targets  According to the num article. 2 of its statutes: The purposes of the association: :1. - To group all the users of the Java programming language in Catalonia as well as other aspects that have relation with this language. :2. - The association is in itself an organic representation of the JUG (Java Users Group) in Catalonia, started by the company creative of the language, Sun MicroSystems, in the promotion of users associations (JUGS) indicating that it declares as a non-profit association and therefore there is not commercial connection with the company and just sustains bonds of users associationism. :3. - To foster and to promote Catalan information society, in all the possible areas. The Catalan was the expression and work language of the association.  President and board of directors  Along its existence, the Aujac is it composed of several boards of directors. The members who compose the Board of Directors, as they marked the statutes, were chosen every two years in the General Assembly of Members, and the former members can be presented to the charge without any harm again. During the first biennium of existence of the AUJAC (2000-2002) the Board of Directors has been composed by the following persons: ::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied ::SotsPresident: Xavier Pi Palomes ::Treasurer: Josep Folch i Serra ::Secretary: Marc Munill Bern√°ndich ::Vowels: :::German Munuera Pubill :::Ignasi P√©rez Valls :::M√≤nica Rayo Moraj√≥n :::Albert Soler Crosas In the 2002 elections, the Board of Directors for the period 2002-2004 was: ::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied ::SotsPresident: Josep Ros Navarro ::Treasurer: Josep Folch i Serra ::Secretary: M√≤nica Rodr√≠guez Gili ::Vowels: :::M√≤nica Rayo Morag√≥n :::David Villegas Terr√≠n :::Aleix Torres Casas In the periode 2004‚Äì2006, the board of directors comes off composed in the following way: ::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied ::SotsPresident: Aleix Torres Casas ::Treasurer: Jordi Marques del Aguila ::Secretary: Maiol Xercavins i Sim√≥ ::Vowels: :::David Villegas Terr√≠n :::Josep Folch Serra :::Inma Camacho Arellano  Main activities  The main activities of the Aujac it is they centered in three main axes: formation, broadcast and collaboration projects.  Formation  In the program of formation it is intended to: Facilitate the technology access to all the persons concerned to the Java technologies. Establish a shared plan of formation in all the Catalan area, which they are governed by the same criterion of evaluation and formation, with a unitary program of courses. The plan had a remarkable success, and the Barcelona Football club, \\"Fundaci√≥n Once\\" and the University Auton√≤ma of Barcelona (UAB) was one of their customers. The plan of formation also allowed the creation of a Java Master Course at the \\"Fundaci√≥ Ind√∫stries de la Informaci√≥\\", entity promoted by Mr. Antoni Farr√©s :ca:Antoni Farr√©s i Sabater. Otherwise, it is also they imparted several courses in the EUIS, Escola Universit√†ria d'Inform√†tica de Sabadell, ascribed to the UAB.  Diffuse  With respect to the diffusion of the Java technology, Aujac organized the \\"Sun Tech Day\\" in Sabadell 2004, and three editions of the \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\", and became the first non-enterprise group to organize an event of this kind in Spain, copied afterwards by JavaHispano, which made two editions of a similar event, after having attended the first as a viewer. As explained in the definition of the \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" these were: :The \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" are an event focused to diffuse the Java technology and other similar technologies to the Catalan community. It is an event open to everybody, focused to several sectors of the Catalan community: university, enterprise, final users and general public. :The goal of the \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" is to visit all Catalan universities along the several editions, located in Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic Islands and the North Catalonia, through the hand of technological companies in this area. :An annual periodicity is established in the event. :The language of expression and work of \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" is, by default, the Catalan. Excluding in those activities in which they have to be made, by non-catalan resident of the persons who develop them, in the languages of expression of the same ones. :The area of performance and divulging of the \\"Java conference C0atalanes\\" they are all those regions of Catalan speech. :The \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" base their diffusion area on three predominant areas: enterprise, university and society. Aujac was pioneer in the Spanish state, the year 2003, in being the first non-profit organization that achieved to gather in a same event about Java, the university world, the enterprise sector and the general society, acting as link of union among them. This joint position of initiative and leadership between Aujac and all the Catalan universities, makes the present model have been adopted by other similar entities all over the Spanish state when carrying out similar events certifying the success of the same ones.  First \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\"  Cartell oficial de les 1eres Jornades Java Catalanes The first \\"Jornades Java Catalanes\\" was celebrated at the ETSE, \\"Escola T√©cnica Superior d'Enginyeria\\" from the \\"Universitat Auton√≤ma de Barcelona\\", on 25 February 2003.

Angela Caicedo, Technology Evangelist of Sun Microsystems, was the speaker of the presentation of the Java2 Standard Edition 5.0 (Tiger). That explained the new features and the technical aspects of this last version of the Java platform. Also it made demonstrations of how to develop applications helping for us of the new possibilities. The session took place on the 20th of December 2004 from 17.30 to 20.00 hours. The assistants received original CDs of Sun and a T-shirt, and raffled books and other gifts. Almost 100 persons attended the act. During the act, AUJAC gives a commemorative diploma of gratitude to Mr. Reginald Hutcherson (boss of the Java Technology Evangelist). You can you find references of this event in the web page of the EUIS:Sun Tech Day a l'Escola Universitaria de Sabadell  Collaboration projects  The Aujac promotes several collaboration projects with entities from all over the territory. Basicament spread on two main axes: those activities that offered a series of services to the community, and of another the impulse of the technology in educational areas. It is necessary to highlight that in the area of the teaching, the Aujac signs with the UAB University, several agreements of collaboration among those that highlight the teaching courses as well as the direction of career projects under the direction of Jordi Pujol Ulied, president of Aujac. It is necessary to highlight that was signed two final university projects: * \\"LABOR\\": Employment Exchange, by Anna Torres Ribas, that received the qualification of: 10 over 10. * \\"hosting.aujac.org\\", by Aleix Torres Casas, that received the qualification of: 9.75 over 10, with Honour mark.  Honour members  Aujac gives every April, the Honour Member to a personality or Catalan entity. With this distinction they want to recognize those personalities or entities that with their disposition, implication, dedication and effort, have contributed to the growth and development of the technology society in our country. 2001 Honour Member In 2001, Mr.:ca:Antoni Farr√©s i Sabater was elected as Honour Member of Aujac. Political icon of the democratic movement in the seventies in Sabadell, was the first democratic mayor of the quoted population, and one of the big social instigators of the post Franco's regime. Instigator on the other hand, of projects of the technology society, like the creation of the \\"Fundaci√≥ Ind√∫stries de la Informaci√≥\\", with headquarters in Sabadell, or instigator of the projects of electronic administrations in Catalonia. It is necessary to highlight that the open speech of the Aujac social presentation was offered by him in the headquarters of the ancient F2I, \\"Fundaci√≥ Ind√∫stries de la Informaci√≥\\", in Sabadell, that today is the Chamber of Commerce of Sabadell. 2002 Honour Member Joan Dav√≠ i Ferrer, became Member of Honor Aujac the year 2002. Joan Dav√≠ i Ferrer, from Terrassa, director of projects in \\"Caixa Terrassa\\", led in the bank world an opening towards the non-proprietary systems that it led to conceiving unedited bank architectures until then it, and who broke outlines, and especially with the traditional systems established in the financial environments. Nowadays, its designs in computer architectures devoted to the bank services are a referent. For all of this reasons, Aujac considered to distinguish it with the Honour member. 2003 Honour Member Dr. Jordi Roig de Zarate receiving the 2003 Honour Member Dr. Jordi Roig de Zarate, professor of the IT Department of the UAB University. It was Director of the EUIS in Sabadell, during period 2000‚Äì2002. Constant fighter towards the own difficulties has always known how to win the battle of the adversities, demonstrating that many times, there are not barriers that can be through with effort, dedication and constancy. Their spirit of improvement, together with its professional profile, they act as him a person who has known how to transmit its pupils the illusion about the new technologies. Him for this qualities and many others, that Dr. Jordi Roig de Zarate was called \\"Honour Member\\" in year 2003. 2004 Honour Member Mr. Eduard Elias (right) receiving the 2004 Honour Member The Mr. Eduard Elias (right), dean of the \\"Col.legi Official d'Enginyeria en Inform√†tica de Catalunya\\", was elected \\"2004 Honour Member\\". Promoter and instigator of the Catalan Association of Engineers in Computer Science (ACEI), he was some of the craftsmen of the creation of the Official School of Engineering in Computer Science of Catalonia. This Honour Member recognizes years of dedication of the technology association and the effort to attain a regularization of the profession. His forces and dedication has allowed the creation of the \\"Col.legi Official d'Enginyeria en Inform√†tica de Catalunya \\". Arrange of this, Aujac want to give him this honour member, in 16 of April 2004, in the UNICA University. 2005 Honour Member Associaci√≥ per a Joves TEB, receives on 15 April 2005, during the closing ceremony of \\"III Jornades Java Catalanes\\", the \\"2005 Honour Member\\". With this distinction it is wants to recognize the effort and dedication carried out, for this entity, that have demonstrated its contribution to the growth and development of information society in zones where the youngsters live in situations of exclusion, and where the new technologies could not be another barrier. It is from this project, and other important project like Xarxa-√ímnia, RavalNet and a long list of projects that they have acted how authentic dynamic social agents and of bridges of cohesion there where bags of social exclusion could be produced.  Dissolution  According to the agreements taken in the last General Assembly of Members, on Tuesday, 24 October 2006 at 20:00 hours, was approved by over ot the two- thirds parts of the votes, the dissolution of the association. The reasons that brought to the dissolution were mainly two, as they were explained at the meeting: :*The little support on the part of the implied companies, and especially of the matrix company, Sun MicroSystems, which finally cut the capital funding of the entity. :*On the other hand, the problem of the technological voluntarism, in Catalonia, a concept that has just not been understood by the society. :* The people associate the technology with affairs of materialist look, where always to take out a benefit and this entails that there are few people willing to collaborate if there is not an economic incentive a lot. :*And on \\"collaborating\\", we understand in an active and constant contribution way. :*The technological voluntarism must be to grow and to be something more than to participate in the development of a software or to participate in the net without going out from home. This close a cycle where AUJAC was the most important non-enterprise entity that promotes the diffusion of Java.

His father was a teacher at a local school. When nine years old, his family moved to the city of Ilam in the Kurdish western part of Iran. Eight years later, they moved to the city of Karaj (near Tehran) where he finished his last year of high school. Throughout the secondary school, he was the first-ranking student. He went on to study civil engineering at Pahlavi University in Shiraz. He focused on optional courses dealing with water, \\"partly because of the poetic value of water in Iran\\", he has said. After his graduation, he was offered a scholarship at Princeton university. During his studies at Princeton he became very active in the protests against the Shah regime in Iran. This earned him the nickname 'the phantom' during his fourth year because he was hardly seen at his desk, but left traces of study all the same. After he obtained his PhD in 1979, he had the opportunity to stay and work in US. However, the Iranian Revolution had just started in Iran and, like 95% of the Iranian population, he supported Khomeini. So he decided to return to Iran. He was bitterly disappointed. After about half a year, the new regime launched the so-called \\"cultural revolution\\", closed all universities, and encouraged all students and teachers to work in industry or agriculture. While working at a consulting company on drainage and irrigation projects, Majid learned about a post-graduate course in hydraulic engineering at IHE Institute in Delft, the Netherlands. He managed to obtain an exit visa through contacts of his employer and left for the Netherlands. After finishing the course, he was offered a research position at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). He and his wife had originally planned to return to Iran, but he was now offered the chance to stay in science. Although torn, he decided to stay in the Netherlands, where he lives till today.

Built in 1852, it is the birthplace and living memorial of Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder Bill Wilson. With 14 guestrooms and a conference room the non-profit bed and breakfast is a center for recovery seminars and regular AA and ALANON meetings. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description The Bill Wilson House stands at the southeast corner of Village Street and Mad Tom Road in the center of East Dorset, and is one of the village's largest buildings. It is a rambling two-story wood frame building, its front facing west toward Village Street, and three sections extending along Mad Tom Road to the east. The front has a single-story porch with modest Greek Revival styling, which extends partially around the north and south sides. It is joined by a 2-1/2 story ell to a large carriage barn, which now serves as a meeting space and lounge. History The building was constructed and opened as a hotel in 1852 in the small Vermont marble quarry village. The owners were the Griffith family when William (Bill) Griffith Wilson was born on November 26, 1895 on the ground floor behind the bar of the hotel during a snow storm. After two years he moved to Rutland until the divorce of his parents. Then, at the age of 11, Bill and his sister, Dorothy, returned to East Dorset to live with their maternal grandparents, the Griffiths. In 1987 the building had been vacant for several years and Ozzie Lepper bought it in order to turn it into a living memorial to Bill W. Since then the building underwent constant renovations and is now a functioning guest house and conference center. Bill W. is buried close by in a cemetery next to his wife Lois and the Griffith family. Room 9 of the hotel is believed to be the room where Bill and Lois stayed during one of their visits. Griffith Library Nearby stands the Griffith Library where Bill lived with his sister and his grandparents. Today it is a museum and a library dedicated to Bill Wilson who is the author of the book Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12 steps and many other books about recovery from alcoholism. It is at this house where he had many important childhood experiences such as building a boomerang from scratch and building a radio. At the nearby Emerald Lake he met his future wife Lois Wilson.Pass it on; p. 17-36 Prior to the development of the Wilson birthplace, Bill and Lois Wilson frequently came back to East Dorset staying at the Aerie inn which is in the same local as the Wilson homestead. The Wilsons spent summers at the Aerie Inn from 1960 up until his year of death in the early 1970s. The Wilsons did not have any children which led them to become close to the owners and builders of the Aerie Inn. The room of their choice to live in was room 6 which to this day has been preserved. The property fell into disrepair up until 2003 when it was purchased with the intent of keeping the integrity of the Wilsons memory intact.

The Iberomaurusian seems to have appeared around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), somewhere between c. 25,000 and 22,500 cal BP.

Definition   Alternative names  Because the name of the Iberomaurusian implies Afro-European cultural contact now generally discounted, researchers have proposed other names: *Mouillian or Mouillan, based on the site of La Mouillah (Goetz 1945-6). *The Oranian, based on the Algerian region of Oran (Breuil 1930, Gobert et al. 1932, McBurney 1967, Barker et al. 2012). *The Epipalaeolithic (Roche 1963). *The Late Upper Palaeolithic (of Northwest African facies, Barton et al. 2005).  Timeline of sites  What follows is a timeline of all published radiocarbon dates from reliably Iberomaurusian contexts, excluding a number of dates produced in the 1960s and 1970s considered \\"highly doubtful\\" (Barton et al. 2013). All dates, calibrated and Before Present, are according to Hogue and Barton (2016). The Tamar Hat date beyond 25,000 cal BP is tentative.  Genetics  In 2013, Iberomaurusian skeletons from the prehistoric sites of Taforalt and Afalou were analyzed for ancient DNA. All of the specimens belonged to maternal clades associated with either North Africa or the northern and southern Mediterranean littoral, indicating gene flow between these areas since the Epipaleolithic. The ancient Taforalt individuals carried the mtDNA Haplogroup N subclades like U6 and M which points to population continuity in the region dating from the Iberomaurusian period. Loosdrecht et al. (2018) analysed genome-wide data from seven ancient individuals from the Iberomaurusian Grotte des Pigeons site near Taforalt in north-eastern Morocco. The fossils were directly dated to between 15,100 and 13,900 calibrated years before present. The scientists found that all males belonged to haplogroup E1b1b, common among Afroasiatic males. The male specimens with sufficient nuclear DNA preservation belonged to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b1a1 (M78), with one skeleton bearing the E1b1b1a1b1 parent lineage to E-V13, one male specimen belonged to E1b1b (M215*). These Y-DNA clades 24,000https://yfull.com/tree/E-M35/ years BP had a common ancestor with the Berbers and the E1b1b1b (M123) subhaplogroup that has been observed in skeletal remains belonging to the Epipaleolithic Natufian and Pre- Pottery Neolithic cultures of the Levant. Maternally, the Taforalt remains bore the U6a and M1b mtDNA haplogroups, which are common among modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Africa. A two-way admixture scenario using Natufian and modern sub-Saharan samples (including West Africans and the Tanzanian Hadza) as reference populations inferred that the seven Taforalt individuals are best modeled genetically as of 63.5% Natufian-related and 36.5% sub-Saharan ancestry (with the latter having both West African-like and Hadza-like affinities), with no apparent gene flow from the Epigravettian culture of Paleolithic southern Europe. The scientists indicated that further ancient DNA testing at other Iberomaurusian archaeological sites would be necessary to determine whether the Taforalt samples were representative of the broader Iberomaurusian gene pool.

Geography The Chui rises in a small swamp in the sandy coastal plains of the far southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. It runs initially southward, then turns east before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. In its final course, the stream marks the last stretch of the Brazilian border with Uruguay. In Brazil, it lies mostly in the municipality of Santa Vit√≥ria do Palmar, with a short section in Chu√≠. The Uruguayan side belongs to the city of Chuy, in the department of Rocha. The Chu√≠ is only a few tens of kilometres long and its water volume is unimpressive; indeed, this is why it is called an arroio or arroyo, which in Portuguese and Spanish mean \\"stream\\", respectively. It would be unremarkable, were it not for the fact that it is known throughout Brazil and mentioned in all Brazilian geography schoolbooks as being the country's southernmost point. The precise most southerly point of Brazil is on a bend of the stream approximately upstream from its mouth, near the twin coastal villages of Barra do Chu√≠ (Brazil) and Barra del Chuy (Uruguay), at .

Payment plans and overage charges Billing for mobile phones can take the form of either a pre- paid plan or a post-paid plan. In a pre-paid plan, the cell phone user pays for the minutes before using them. This kind of plan is popular in many Asian, South American, and some European countries. In post-paid plans, the cell phone user pays at the end of the month for the minutes used during that month. Post-paid plans are common in North America and are catching up in other countries. The cell phone providers (that is, the wireless carriers) typically charge a monthly fee for the post-paid plans. In turn, users get a monthly quota of minutes. When a user goes over the minutes allowed under the particular post-paid cell phone plan, they are charged separately for the extra minutes. In North America, this fee for the extra minutes is called overage fees or overage charges. For example, suppose that a mobile phone user signs up for a post-paid cell phone plan that costs $40 per month and is allowed a quota of 700 minutes under that plan. If this user were to end up using 750 minutes in a month, then they would be charged an overage fee for the extra 50 minutes. Mobile networks may offer the ability to check how much of a quota has been used, or users may sign up to third-party monitoring services. Overage charges are being phased out by some major providers. Overage charges in Germany In Germany as of 2015, most post-paid cell phone plans are (for calls within Germany) either true flat rates (monthly rates between 17 and 40 EUR, depending on how much data and how many SMS are included) or include a more limited amount of included minutes (100-200 Minutes), with a modest overage of 7 to 21 Euro-cent per minute. The time of days is not accounted for. Overage charges in North American countries North American post-paid cell phone plans typically divide the minutes used in various categories such as peak minutes, evening and night minutes (also called off-peak minutes), weekend minutes, mobile-to-mobile minutes, and so on. The peak minutes also go by the name of \\"anytime minutes\\" or \\"whenever minutes\\". The peak minutes allowed under most post-paid plans are usually limited (such as 750 peak minutes allowed in a month for $40 per month) and minutes in all other categories are either free, or come with a large monthly quota (such as 5000 weekend and weeknight minutes).

Steiner studied law in Paris and Munich from 1971 to 1977 and qualified as a judge in 1981. Career In 1981, Steiner entered the German Foreign Office. As a young political officer in Prague in the summer of 1989, he won plaudits for his handling of a refugee crisis that helped lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall. As hundreds of East Germans surrounded his embassy grounds, asking for asylum and West German citizenship, he helped some of them over the wall himself, onto the embassy grounds, which were West German territory. Then he worked to negotiate a deal to allow the East Germans to leave the embassy and go to the West. During his career with the German government, Steiner served as head of the liaison office for German humanitarian aid in Zagreb, made his mark in the 1990s working with the so-called Contact Group of nations monitoring the Yugoslav wars (of which Germany was a member), and as head of the co-ordination unit for multilateral peace efforts. He also led the special section \\"International Peace Efforts in Yugoslavia\\" from 1994 to 1995. Steiner served nearly six months (January‚ÄìJuly 1997) as principal deputy to Carl Bildt, the first high representative in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1998, while serving as Germany's ambassador in Prague, he was plucked by Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der to work in the chancellor's office as his foreign and security policy adviser. And in 2001 he was forced to resign after the so- called \\"\\".

He taught at Lehigh University from 1962 until his retirement in 1995. He is the author of several books, the most notable of which is his introduction to philosophy, The Great Conversation: A Historical Introduction to Philosophy.  Early life and influences  Norman Melchert was born in 1933 in Waterloo, Iowa. The son of a prominent Lutheran minister, Christian thought has been a strong influence on his life, thought, and works. As a young man, he felt moved to follow in his father's footsteps and become a minister. To this end he graduated from Wartburg College in 1955 and went on to Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, simultaneously doing graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated from seminary in 1958, and from U. Penn in 1959 (Masters degree) and 1964 (PhD). His thesis was an examination of the work of the American realist and humanist, Roy Wood Sellars. He resigned from the ministry in 1965 and devoted his energies to philosophy, being particularly interested in epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of mind.  Personal life  In 1956 Norman married Novalene Black, who became his lifelong partner. Together they have three children. He retired from Lehigh University in 1995 and with his wife moved to Richmond, Virginia where two of his sons and their families live. He then became an adjunct professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, teaching occasionally and continuing with his writings. In the mid 1970s he took up cycling and became a very successful racer in the veteran's class, winning many medals and trophies in Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Zealand, where his eldest son lives. In 1991 he rode across the country with two friends from Seattle to Cape May New Jersey.  Books  *Realism, Materialism and the Mind: The Philosophy of Roy Wood Sellars Norman Melchert (1968).

Educated at Lancing College, Taylor was a right-handed batsman who usually batted in the lower order in first-class cricket and a slow right-arm occasional bowler. He made a single appearance for Hampshire during the 1935 County Championship, scoring 0 and 21 in a home match against Lancashire. In the 1939 season with no other amateur available for more than a few matches, Taylor captained Hampshire, though he did not appear in the final few matches of the season when Giles Baring was available to play and was worth a place in the team on merit. The move to appoint Taylor as captain was not a success, and the team won only two out of 23 matches under his captaincy. In his obituary in the 1987 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, it was noted that he \\"would never have claimed to be more than a club player\\".

Built about 1793, it is a well-preserved example of a rural vernacular farmhouse of the period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Simon Tiffany House is located in a rural setting in southwestern Salem, on the south side of Darling Street near the town line with Lyme. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window. The flanking bays are slightly asymmetrical in their placement. The interior follows a central chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule that has a winding stair to the upper level, and parlors on either side of the chimney. The area behind the chimney is now a single large space that was once the kitchen, but it was also once probably two separate spaces combined by later alteration. A single- story ell extends to one side, housing a modern kitchen and dining area. Some of the windows have inside shutters, a feature that rarely survives from the period. and Ebenezer Tiffany purchased the land where the house stands in 1786 from the state, which had seized the property because it had been owned by a Loyalist who fled during the American Revolutionary War. Tiffany had been leasing the land prior to its confiscation. The house was built by his son Simon on a portion of the land given to him in the 1790s. The property remained in the Tiffany family until 1895, and the house was given a careful restoration beginning in the 1920s.

In his opening arguments in that case, Squibb, who was simultaneously a distinguished barrister and a historian, argued, to the satisfaction of the court, that since the modern class of Doctors of Laws were no longer trained as advocates, their role must necessarily be performed by barristers. This was because Victorian reforms, which had unified the other classes of court attorney into the single profession of Barrister, had overlooked the Doctors of Law. Birth, family and education He was born in Chester on 1 December 1906, the eldest son of Reginald Augustus Hodder Squibb, from a Dorset family. He was related to Arthur Squibb, who was Clarenceux King of Arms at the College of Arms 1646-1650 (in the time of Cromwell). He was educated at the King's School, Chester, and the Queen's College, Oxford, where he took his first degree and also a Bachelor of Civil Law. Legal career He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1930, and practised as a barrister for the rest of his life. His London home was a flat in the Temple, in Paper Buildings, next to the Inner Temple Gardens, although his main home was in Dorset. He was elected as a Master of the Bench (bencher) by the Inner Temple in 1951; became Reader in 1975, and served as Treasurer (the senior Bencher) in 1976. Upon call to the Bar, he joined the chambers of RM Montgomery KC where he was a pupil of Malcolm Trustram Eve (later Lord Silsoe). He practised from these chambers for the rest of his career, eventually becoming the Head of Chambers. He specialised in real property, rating and valuation, and planning work. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1956 and in silk specialized in local government work at the Parliamentary Bar. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Dorset in 1943, and served as Deputy Chairman of the Dorset Quarter Sessions 1950‚Äì53, and as Chairman 1953‚Äì71. He was President of the Transport Tribunal 1962‚Äì81. He was Chief Commons Commissioner, 1971‚Äì85. Heraldry and history Squibb was interested in genealogy and heraldry from his youth, and throughout his life he combined his professional practice with scholarly research and publication on historical topics linked to his interests. He wrote the definitive modern study of The Law of Arms in England (1953), and other monographs including Reports of Heraldic Cases in the Court of Chivalry (1956); The High Court of Chivalry (1959); Visitation Pedigrees and the Genealogist (1964, 2nd edn 1978); Founders‚Äô Kin (1972); Doctors‚Äô Commons (1977); and Precedence in England and Wales (1981). He also edited a number of volumes for the Harleian Society, including Munimenta Heraldica (1985), an anthology of constitutional documents relating to the College of Arms, the Earl Marshal, and the officers of arms. He was Junior Counsel to the Crown in Peerage and Baronetcy Cases, 1954‚Äì56, but this ceased upon his appointment to silk. He was appointed Honorary Historical Adviser in Peerage Cases to the Attorney-General in 1965. His work among the records of the College of Arms made him liked and respected by the Officers of Arms, and particularly by Anthony Wagner, who valued his combination of legal and historical research skills, and who wrote a Foreword to The Law of Arms in England. In 1959 he was appointed Norfolk Herald Extraordinary, and in 1976 he became the Earl Marshal's Lieutenant, Assessor and Surrogate in the Court of Chivalry. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1946; a Fellow of the Society of Genealogists in 1973; and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 1978. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Scriveners, and served as Master 1979‚Äì80. He was appointed Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO), an honour in the personal gift of the Queen, in 1982. Personal life In 1936 he married Bessie Whittaker, who died in 1954. With her, he had one daughter. In 1955, he married Evelyn Higgins, who died in 1992. He died in Dorchester on 3 January 1994.

Biography Xiaoyong Chen first studied composition at the Beijing Central Conservatory of Music from 1980 until 1985. In 1985 he moved to Germany where he attended the Music Academy of Hamburg to complete his studies with Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. Chen works frequently as a Guest Professor in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and other places. Since 1987 he has been a professor at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg at the Asia-Africa Institute and he is self- employed. Style Chen's style of composition is close to the Asian mentality, where the creation and development of the sound is in the centre of attention. His works consist of a seemingly simple sound event which will develop in unexpected ways. Chen regards the process of composing as communication with the sound; he tries to find and show the possibilities the sound provides. It is for this reason that Chen's works create an open atmosphere which leads, while listening, to the impression that neither composer nor listener can know where the music is leading.

He is the founder of killerapp.com, a popular comparison shopping site for computers and consumer electronics that was acquired by CNET Networks Inc. in 1999 for $50 million.  Early life  Born in Taichung, Taiwan, Ben who is an only child, moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina at eight months of age with his mother (Hsiu Lan) and father (Sheng Dien) where they lived for six years before moving to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He attended high-school at Albert Campbell Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario and graduated with honors and awards in Computer Science and Visual Arts. In 1993 he received his Bachelor's Degree in Applied Science, Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto. When he was 11, Ben began to take an interest in programming. One summer, Ben's father assigned him to write a database system (using DBASE) for their family business. With help from his father, Ben started Linguasoft Corp. and sold his system to bookstores and libraries. To this day, the Royal Ontario Museum is still using his software. Barely a teenager, Ben Chiu played table-tennis for the provincial (Ontario) team. Under the relentless training of renowned Yugoslavian coach Zoran Kosanovic, Ben won the Canadian National Championships (junior singles), Formosa Cup (men's singles) and took 2nd place at the 1984 U.S. Open (junior doubles). In addition to high school, Ben also attended school for the gifted in visual arts. His art teacher once offered to buy one of his oil paintings but Ben declined. Some of his wildlife paintings have been displayed at the McMichael Gallery in Kleinburg, Ontario. At the time, his style was inspired by Robert Bateman, Glen Loates and Andrew Wyeth.  Career  In 1994 while the Internet was still in its infancy, Ben moved to Fremont, California to help manage his father's publishing business--Pan Asian Publications. While buying computer hardware for the company, he discovered it was tedious to browse through thousands of magazine listings for the best deals. Instead, he cut the spines off publications like Computer Shopper and PC Magazine and keyed all the specs and prices into a database, page after page, one page at a time. After e-commerce sites began to appear on the Internet, Ben developed a web crawler that would automatically gather and update prices around the clock. This was to form the foundation for his new company. Ben formally incorporated KillerApp, Corp. in 1995 and went on to pioneer the concept of online comparison shopping (also known as the price engine). This paradigm shift proved devastating to the computer publication industry. \\"Print\\" simply could not compete with the timely content and convenience of these specialized search engines. The web crawlers at KillerApp ran 24/7, updating 1.5 million prices daily. Within two years, killerapp.com was receiving 14 million page views per month and 1/2 million monthly users. The site was also generating 150,000 leads per month for its base of 360 merchants. In order to sustain the growth of its business, Ben raised two rounds of funding from angel investors that included: C.S. Ho (founder of Mitac/Synnex and honorary chairman of Computex); Charlene Wang (president of FIC and daughter of tycoon Y.C. Wang); Ming Chien (chairman of FIC) and Cher Wang (chairperson of VIA Technologies and daughter of Y.C. Wang). In 1998, Ziff-Davis approached Ben with a buy-out offer. He declined but instead brought in Deutsche Bank to produce competitive bids. A long M&A; roadshow ensued. Ben held due diligence discussions with Microsoft, ZDNet, Yahoo!, CNET, Excite, Lycos and Inktomi. On March 23, 1999 he sold his company to CNET in a stock swap valued at US$54 million and joined CNET as the Director of Commerce Services.  In the media  Ben Chiu is the second Taiwanese American (since Jerry Yang co-founder of Yahoo!) to appear on the cover of Wired Magazine. Po Bronson chronicled Chiu's rags-to-riches story in his best- selling novel The Nudist on the Late Shift (). His story has also been recounted in Chinese by Peggy Teng () in her book ËèØË£îÁ∂≤Ë∑ØËã±ÈõÑÂÇ≥Â•á (translation: Unique Passages of Overseas-Chinese Internet Heroes).

He was a professor in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. He is survived by his wife Sandra Goodall and their son, Nicolas Saylor Goodall.  Biography  The only child of Harold Lloyd Goodall and Naomi Saylor Goodall, he grew up in Europe (Rome, London) and the United States (West Virginia, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Maryland). He obtained a B.A. in language arts from Shepherd University in 1973; a M.A. in speech communication from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1974; and a Ph.D. in speech communication from The Pennsylvania State University in 1980. At Penn State, Gerald M. Phillips and Stanley Weintraub, who co-directed his dissertation,https://irqr.ucpress.edu/content/ucpirqr/2/1/67.full.pdf a rhetorical biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald. His first academic appointment was at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (1980‚Äì1989), where he was promoted to associate professor in 1984, and appointed founding chair of the Department of Communication Arts. During this time he began working on autoethnography and narrative ethnography. In 1989 he accepted an associate professorship in the Department of Communication at the University of Utah (1989‚Äì1991) and published the first book-length autoethnography in the field of communication studies: Casing a Promised Land: The Autobiography of an Organizational Detective as Cultural Ethnographer (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), and his second autoethnography, Living in the Rock n Roll Mystery: Reading Context, Self, and Others as Clues (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991). At Utah he collaborated with Eric Eisenberg to produce the first critical and cultural textbook in organizational communication, Organizational Communication: Balancing Creativity and Constraint (Bedford/St. Martins, 1993), a book that won the Textbook and Academic Authors Association ‚ÄúTexty‚Äù award for the Outstanding Textbook in Education, Communication, Visual, and Performing Arts in 1994.http://www.taaonline.net/awards/textys.html He resigned from Utah in 1991 to accept a full professorship and leadership responsibilities for a newly formed speech and communication studies area at Clemson University (1991‚Äì1995). During this period he investigated the illusive concept of ‚Äúwriting the ineffable‚Äù in relation to the spiritual quest of individuals and the expressed spirituality of communities, culminating in the completion of his ethnographic trilogy with the publication of Divine Signs: Connecting Spirit to Community (Southern Illinois University Press, 1996). From 1995 until 2004 he served as founding head of the Department of Communication at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and throughout this period he continued to explore the relationships among narrative, creative nonfiction, and communication scholarship, most notably in Writing the New Ethnography (AltaMira Press, 2000). In 2003 the National Communication Association gave him the Gerald M. Phillips Award for Distinguished Applied Communication Scholarship.http://www.natcom.org/index.asp?bid=2374 From 2004 until 2009 he served as professor and director of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. In 2006 he won the ‚ÄúBest Book‚Äù award from the Ethnography Division of the National Communication Association for his memoir A Need to Know: The Clandestine History of a CIA Family (Left Coast Press, 2006),http://www.natcom.org/index.asp?bid=10760 a book reviewed by Chris Petit in The Guardian, and one the reviewer calls \\"an important and brilliant take on life in mid-20th century US.\\" Since July 1, 2009 he was a professor of communication at ASU and an active contributor to the Consortium for strategic communication, of which Steve Corman is director. He served as a co-principal investigator (with Steve Corman, as principal investigator), of a grant from the Office of Naval Research of $2,588,162 (2009‚Äì2012) ‚ÄúIdentifying Terrorist Narratives and Counter-Narratives: Embedding Story Analysts in Expeditionary Units‚Äùhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.939.6955&rep;=rep1&type;=pdfhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077800411429100https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230108967 A festschrift honoring his life and work, created and edited by his colleagues Sarah Amira de la Garza, Nick Trujillo, and Robert Krizek, was published by Innovative Inquiry in July 2012.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.894.769&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf In 2014, Andrew F. Herrmann and Kristen DiFate edited a special issue of Storytelling Self Society reflecting upon the work of Goodall and fellow communication scholar and ethnographer Nick Trujillo.http://wsupress.wayne.edu/journals/detail/storytelling-self- societyhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.963.9935&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf  Major contributions  Goodall was a pioneer in autoethnography and narrative ethnography, following in the footsteps of Thomas Benson at Penn State, who wrote the first published autoethnography in the communication field, \\"Another Shootout in Cowtown,\\" in 1981, and Michael E. Pacanowski, whose \\"Slouching Towards Chicago‚Äù was the second, published in 1988. Goodall's Casing a Promised Land (1989) was the third contribution in the field and the first book length study that employed autoethnographic methods,http://orm.sagepub.com/pap.dtl in this instance to study high technology cultures in Huntsville, Alabama. Goodall's writing style was greatly influenced by a generation of creative nonfiction/new journalism writers, including Norman Mailer, Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Tom Wolfe, and Joan Didion; by novelists Barry Hannah, Raymond Chandler, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and Thomas Pynchon; and by the American poet Walt Whitman. Goodall also cites Lee Gutkind‚Äôs creative nonfiction definition ‚Äúthe literature of reality‚Äù as a key to understanding his style. An article he wrote summarizes the influences on him and describes how the power of narrative works in his writing: H. L. Goodall Jr., ‚ÄúWriting Like a Guy in Textville: A Personal Reflection on Narrative Seduction,‚Äù International Review of Qualitative Research, 2, (May 2009), 67‚Äì88. As an academic author who reached a broader public audience, his stories and studies focused on three major themes: # Narratives about American cultures: From being an ‚Äúorganizational detective,‚Äù to playing rhythm guitar in a rock n roll band, to serving as an active contributor to a political campaign, to studying football as a spiritual practice in the South, to analyzing the communication practices in the ancient art of feng shui, to studying the Ferraristi of Long Island, to a ‚Äúmicroethnography‚Äù of a \\"witch shop\\" in Old Salem, Massachusetts, his writing has explored diverse cultures, individuals, and groups. # Narratives about the Cold War and its relationship to the current Global War on Terror: Following the tragic events of 9/11 Goodall began keeping track of what became known as the ‚ÄúGlobal War on Terror‚Äù and its cultural relationship to the Cold War. Since that time he has published numerous accounts of the changes to American culture following 9/11 (e.g., \\"Fieldnotes from our War Zone\\") to the culture of secrets and secrecy that pervades both Cold War and the post-9/11 era. Writing on this theme has led Goodall to explore, with Angela Trethewey, the ‚Äúdark side of leadership,‚Äù with Steve Corman and Angela Trethewey how strategic communication can improve counter-terrorism and public diplomacy, as well as the long-term effects of growing up in a family that kept national security secrets. # Narratives about narrative, and especially about how to write and think about them: From his earlier book, Writing the New Ethnography (2000) to the more recent Writing Qualitative Inquiry (2008) Goodall provides guides to fieldwork and writing for a new generation of scholars. In the edited volume Qualitative Inquiry and the Politics of Evidence, Goodall, along with his colleagues Carolyn Ellis, Art Bochner, Laurel Richardson, and Norman K. Denzin, is cited http://www.lcoastpress.com/book.php?id=141 as having had a major influence over a generation of scholars and colleagues. These scholars include Robin Boylorn, Tony E. Adams, Andrew F. Herrmann, Amber Kinser, Robert Krizek, Ron Pelias, Caroline Joan S. Picart, Chris Poulos, Lisa Tillman, Nick Trujillo, and Jillian Tullis. Death Goodall was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer in June 2011. He created a blog about what it is like to live this way to provide readers with a personal narrative on his and his family's end-of- life experiences.  Selected publications  In addition to 35 peer-reviewed journal articles, over 25 book chapters, and numerous reports and other publications,http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/people/pdf/Goodall- CV0809.pdf Goodall is the author of 20 academic and popular books, and of textbooks that have gone into many editions.
