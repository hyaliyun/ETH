Plot Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron identifies the author as 'Ata'i, who is further identified as 'Amid Abu'l 'Ala' 'Ata b. Yaqub Kateb Razi by Blochet. He was a poet of the Ghaznavid court and died around 1078-1079. The language of the Borzu-nama is characteristics of texts of the 11th century. The story is versified in the same meter and style of Ferdowsi's Shahnama. The Borzu-nama is possibly the longest of the post Shahnama epic poems and includes material from Iranian national legends not used by Ferdowsi. The story starts with Sohrab the son of Rostam. On his way from Turan to fight the Iranians he marries a woman named Shahru. Before leaving, he gives her a token to give to their unborn child. The child is named Borzu by Shahru and she raises him without disclosing his father's identity. The young Borzu is recruited into Afrasiab's, the King of Turan, army. Borzu eventually forces his mother to reveal his father's name. On finding that it was Sohrab, he sets off to battle Rostam to avenge his father's death. Afrasiab then sends him with an army to Iran, but Borzu is captured by Rostam's son Faramarz and taken to Sistan. Shahru is informed of Borzu's capture, and helps him escape. He is recaptured by Rostam, and not recognizing his grandfather, Borzu battles Rostam. His life is spared at the last minute when Shahru reveals their relationship. Borzu and Rostam embrace and Borzu joins the Iranian forces. Afrasiab learns of this and sends Susan-e Rameshgar, a musician and sorceress to capture Rostam and Borzu. Afrasiab arrives with his army and the epic takes up a long series of battles and adventures that include famous Iranian and Turanian heroes from the Shahnameh, along with Divs, Paris (fairies) and wizards. The tale concludes with the death of Borzu at the hands of a Div.  Editions  The Borzu-nama has not yet been published in a critical edition, but versions of the text have been included in the Shah Nama editions of both Turner Macan (pp. 2160‚Äì296) and DabirsiƒÅqi. Possible influences Friedrich von Suhtschek, in a discussion of the Iranian sources of the Grail legend, claimed, but did not prove, that the Borzu Nama is the direct source of Wolfram von Eschenbach‚Äôs Parzifal.

He is currently the President of Emirates. He was also Managing Director of Sri Lankan Airlines until 2008. The latter post resulted from the acquisition of a 40% stake in SriLankan Airlines by Emirates in April 1998. However, that post was lost when the Sri Lankan government took control of the airline and Emirates never renewed their contract for management of the airline. Clark became President of Emirates in 2003 after spending 18 years helping build an aviation empire, which owes much of its success to the route network he established after joining as Head of Airline Planning. In addition, Clark is the Chairman of the Emirates Airline Foundation, a non-profit charity that he helped found which provides humanitarian philanthropic aid and services for children in need around the world.

Although many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned SET by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA.  History  In January 1941, the Navy at St. Louis's Lambert Field began full primary training. Since Lambert was a very busy airport, also being used by the Army and the manufacturers, inexperienced student pilots were not allowed to solo. The Navy traveled 11 miles north and eventually purchased several hundred acres from Ruth Neubeiser. An initial $250,000 was spent building a 2,000 ft. octagonal mat, a hangar, and barracks. Navy flight training students were organized into two units - the port and starboard wings. In the morning, one wing would fly while the other attended classes and other activities. In the afternoon, it was the opposite. Students were bused to and from Neubeiser for their solos. A considerable number of aircraft were kept at Neubeiser as well as ground crewmen who serviced the aircraft and lived there. The facility was later renamed Smartt Field in honor of Ensign Joseph Smartt, who was killed in the Japanese attack on NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii on December 7, 1941.

At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth Fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six- mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. Embarked were the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions under Major General Roy S. Geiger. The northern support craft included , USS LSM(R)-195, , , , and . On 3 May 1945 the 188-class LSM(R)s were put to the test when the Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer . She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded.

The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM(R)-195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. The following day the ordeal for the LSM(R)'s reached its tragic climax. was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R)-190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R)-190 was fighting her final battle, LSM(R)-194 was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. W.E. Woodson CO LSM(R)-195 survived the sinking and reported on 5 May 1945: Two planes were observed approaching, the closest identified as NICK. This plane was taken under fire by the 5\\"/38 and both 40MM guns as he circled and approached from the starboard. The other plane, started an attack run on our port side coming in at a very low altitude and maneuvering violently to confuse our two port 20MM gunners who had taken him under fire. This plane was strafing on its way in and hit the port side ripping the main deck all the way into midships. The explosion and depth of damage indicated that this plane carried a bomb. The rockets that were loaded in the launchers topside began exploding in every direction as the fire spread from one broken rocket motor to another causing a great deal of shrapnel and fragments to be in the air at all times. These rockets were propelled only short distances with numerous hits about the deck causing fires. The plane or bomb had also penetrated the forward assembly room causing assembled rockets to be propelled throughout the ship and the area surrounding it. References Woodson, William E.

At the , Rappville recorded a population of 169 people. History The district in which Rappville is situated was initially developed by European settlers for cattle grazing (for example the very extensive Wooroowoolga Station) and forestry (first, cedar getting, then other species) from the 1840s onwards; to these rural industries was added dairying, which became an important component from the 1860s for almost the next 100 years.Gardiner, pp. 74‚Äì75 Initially, rural products were transported by road and the network of navigable rivers, however in 1903 the small but growing North Coast railway line reached Casino and two years later was extended south to Grafton. A sawmiller named John Murray established his sawmill by the new railway in an area initially called Murray's Siding, to exploit both the local supply of timber and the onward rail connections first to Casino and thence to the then inland port town of Lismore, sited at the highest navigable point of an arm of the Richmond (later renamed Wilsons) River. It appears that whole logs were also loaded for downstream milling, as may be judged by the following item appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald for 15 November 1906: > LARGE TIMBER TRAIN. LISMORE, Wednesday. A special timber train, which > arrived here from Murray's siding, Grafton-Casino line, consisted of 13 > eight-wheel waggons and six other vehicles. It was the longest and heaviest > timber train seen here. Two engines were used to bring the train from > Casino. The consignment, about 400 tons, was for the Richmond River Timber > Company. About 400 tons of log timber are brought in weekly, 37 to 40 miles, > for that company, and the British-Australia Company's mills, formerly > Dorrough's. Large quantities of timber are obtained from other sources. The > Sydney Morning Herald Thu 15 Nov 1906 Page 5 LARGE TIMBER TRAIN. Available > via trove.nla.gov.au With the thriving timber cutting, sawmilling, and outbound timber supply industry, the nucleus of a new settlement grew up around the siding which by 1910 contained a butcher, a blacksmith, a small store, a school (opened in 1908), a church (opened in 1910, dedicated in 1911) and a bakery; it was formally gazetted as \\"Rappville\\" in March 1911,\\"Village Lands at Rappville\\". Department of Lands, Sydney, 22 March 1911. Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales (Sydney, NSW : 1901 ‚Äì 2001), p. 1732. named after a prominent early settler and businessman Henry Rapp, who first selected land in the area in 1888. In the same year, Rapp opened his new Commercial Hotel, designed by the local architectural firm of Popplewell and Sykes, on a site opposite the small Rappville Railway Station.Gardiner, p. 52 (By 1923 the rail link was extended south to Sydney and by 1930 to north to Brisbane, opening up the whole of the north coast of New South Wales to rail traffic); Rapp's Commercial Hotel operated using the licence from a previous establishment of the same name owned by his wife's mother in the neighbouring settlement of Myrtle Creek, of which virtually nothing now remains. 1911 also saw construction of a new railway station allowing passengers to alight and take their lunches at the newly constructed hotel and adjacent tea rooms. Other businesses in the village included a second butcher, an ice works, a second produce store and a branch of the Bank of New South Wales which also operated as a post office.Anonymous, 1999: \\"Social Assessment NSW Upper North EAST CRA Regions: A report undertaken for the NSW CRA/RFA Steering Committee, 22 September 1999\\". Available online at http://www.agriculture.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/rfa/regions/nsw-north- east/social-economic/social-assessment/upper-ne-nsw/social-assessment-report- une.pdf Through to the 1930s the village was fairly prosperous but has declined since then, in part because of a move of much passenger and freight traffic from rail to road as well as the gradual reduction of the timber industry.Gardiner, p. 73 In 1997, a community workshop/discussion session in the village as input to the North East New South Wales Regional Forest Agreement identified additional factors contributing to population decline since the 1980s including the increased difficulty of making a living from cattle grazing, the closure of nearby cattle yards and small timber mills, the loss of railway/sleeper workers following the closure of a local railway sleeper yard in 1987, and the loss of customers visiting the pub following the introduction of new drink-driving laws; however this was partially offset by the establishment of commercial tea tree plantations in the region as well as a modest influx of newcomers from the city attracted by cheap land prices in the area. The Sydney-Brisbane railway line continues to pass through the village, although the station has long closed and associated buildings have since disappeared.Rappville station. NSWrail.net, accessed 1 September 2009. The most prominent building in the village is still the Commercial Hotel, also known as the Rappville Pub.Rappville. Australian explorer, accessed 1 September 2009. The village also contains a post office, a hall, an Anglican church (St. John's, which celebrated its Centenary in 2011) and a primary school. The hotel was due to be closed in 2016 on account of difficulty in meeting current fire regulations, but is presently (2019) open and under restoration, having changed hands in 2017. In 2008, the village played host to the film crew of the popular U.K. Television series \\"Heartbeat\\" who filmed parts of two episodes at the Hotel, as part of a plotline which took the cast and crew to Australia following a murder mystery. An additional local item of interest is the remains of a bush tea tree still: distillation of tea tree oil from native bushes was a subsidiary occupation for farmers in the area, until it was replaced by production from commercial plantations in the 1970s.Gardiner, pp. 75‚Äì76 Commercial cultivation of the local tea tree plant, Melaleuca alternifolia, which is native to the area and thrives in the flat, seasonally swampy habitat that surrounds Rappville, is now very successful. In a 2013 article, Main Camp Natural Extracts near Rappville was described as \\"the world's largest commercial plantation\\" of tea tree for oil, with 1,500 hectares of tea tree under production at its peak, with half of that figure remaining as at 2013; according to the company's website in 2019, its Myrtle Creek property currently spans some 4,300 ha and using sustainable practices, regenerates over 30 million tea trees each year on laser leveled land. The area which includes Rappville lies in the traditional lands of the Aboriginal Bundjalung Nation, and contained speakers of the Birrihn (or Biriin) dialect. 2019 bushfire disaster In October 2019 the village was devastated as a destructive bushfire that started in Busbys Flat raced through the residential area, leading to the loss of at least 15 houses although no lives were believed to have been lost. The village's pub and primary school were saved although the hall was destroyed. The fire also resulted in significant damage to the Sydney-Brisbane railway line, loss of local power and telecommunications infrastructure, and closure of adjacent highways to traffic in several places.

It is produced by Mycle Schneider, a founding member of WISE- Paris, which is the French branch of the anti-nuclear group WISE, which he directed from 1983 to 2003.Mycle Schneider. The Citizens Science Concept ‚Äì The Role of Independent and Counter-Expertise 2019 Report The 2019 report reached the conclusion that 'Stabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is slow. [Nuclear power] meets no technical or operational need that these low-carbon competitors [wind, solar and other renewable energy] cannot meet better, cheaper, and faster. Even sustaining economically distressed reactors saves less carbon per dollar and per year than reinvesting its avoidable operating cost (let alone its avoidable new subsidies) into cheaper efficiency and renewables.'https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/The-World-Nuclear-Industry- Status-Report-2019-HTML.html The report also reached the conclusion that Small Modular Reactors are unlikely to play any significant role in the future energy landscape. 2017 Data-visualization tool In January an interactive visualization on nuclear power construction was launched. This contains information on the 754 reactors that are or have been under-construction since 1951. The Global Nuclear Power Database is hosted by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.UPDATE: Global Nuclear Power Database, Thursday 23 February 2017. 2016 report As of the middle of 2016, 31 countries were operating nuclear reactors for energy purposes. Nuclear power plants generated 2,441 net terawatt-hours (TWh or billion kilowatt-hours) of electricity in 2015, a 1.3 percent increase.UPDATE2: World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2016, Thursday 23 February 2017. 2015 report Globally, the nuclear industry's situation continued to deteriorate in 2015, except in China. Eight out of the ten nuclear power reactor startups in 2015 were in China.UPDATE1: World Nuclear Industry Status as of 1 January 2016: Mind the China Effect, Monday 4 January 2016. 2013 report Written by Mycle Schneider and Antony Froggatt with contributions of four other experts from Japan, the UK and France, says that the nuclear industry was struggling with grave problems prior to the Fukushima accident, but that the impact of the accident has become increasingly visible. Global electricity generation from nuclear plants dropped by a historic 7 percent in 2012, adding to the record drop of 4 percent in 2011. The 427 operating reactors worldwide, as of 1 July 2013, are 17 lower than the peak in 2002. The nuclear share in the world's power generation declined steadily from a historic peak of 17 percent in 1993 to about 10 percent in 2012. The report details a range of restart scenarios for Japan's nuclear reactor fleet which, as of September 2013, were all shutdown. Nuclear power's share of global commercial primary energy production plunged to 4.5 percent, a level last seen in 1984. Besides an extensive update on nuclear economics, the report also includes an assessment of the major challenges at the Fukushima nuclear site, in particular the highly contaminated water on site. This water contained in the basement of reactors and in storage tanks contains 2.5 times the total amount of caesium-137 released at the Chernobyl accident. The report says that China, Germany and Japan, three of the world's four largest economies, as well as India, now generate more power from renewables than from nuclear power. For the first time in 2012 China and India generated more power from wind alone than from nuclear plants, while in China solar electricity generation grew by 400 percent in one year. 2012 report According to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2012, written by Mycle Schneider and Antony Froggatt, nuclear power accounted for 11 percent of worldwide electricity generation. World atomic power production dropped by a record 4.3 percent in 2011 as the global financial crisis and the Fukushima disaster in Japan prompted plant shutdowns and slowed construction of new sites. Seven reactors began operating in 2011 and 19 were shuttered. The report shows that following the Fukushima crisis in March 2011, Germany, Switzerland and Taiwan announced their withdrawal from nuclear power. Output was further restricted as nations suspended construction plans amid safety concerns and economic stagnation, forcing utilities to study extending lifetimes, which raises considerable safety issues. At least five countries, including Egypt and Kuwait, have suspended plans to build their first nuclear reactors. In the U.K., major companies like RWE, EON, and SSE have all abandoned new-build proposals in 2011/12, while companies in Japan and Bulgaria have suspended construction. The Fukushima disaster also created certification and licensing delays. 2010‚Äì11 report The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010-2011 is authored by Mycle Schneider, Antony Froggatt, and Steve Thomas and published by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute. The foreword is written by Amory Lovins. According to the report, the international nuclear industry has been unable to stop the slow decline of nuclear energy. The world's reactor fleet is aging quickly and not enough new units are coming online. As of April 1, 2011, there were 437 nuclear reactors operating in the world, which was seven fewer than in 2002. The Olkiluoto plant has had particular problems: > The flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in Finland, managed by the largest > nuclear builder in the world, AREVA NP, has turned into a financial fiasco. > The project is four years behind schedule and at least 90 percent over > budget, reaching a total cost estimate of ‚Ç¨5.7 billion ($8.3 billion) or > close to ‚Ç¨3,500 ($5,000) per kilowatt. The report says that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster is exacerbating many of the problems that nuclear energy is facing. There is \\"no obvious sign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn empirically evident downward trend into a promising future\\", and the Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to accelerate the decline. With long lead times of 10 years and more, it will be difficult to maintain, let alone increase, the number of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. Moreover, says the report, it is clear that nuclear power development cannot keep up with the pace of renewable energy commercialization. For the first time, in 2010 total installed nuclear power capacity in the world (375 gigawatts) fell behind aggregate installed capacity (381 GW) of three specific renewables ‚Äî wind turbines (193 GW), biomass and waste-to-energy plants (65 GW), and solar power (43 GW). 2009 report The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009 presents quantitative and qualitative information on the nuclear power plants in operation, under construction and in planning phases throughout the world.

Constructed in the late nineteenth century for a prominent local pharmacist, it now abuts a city hospital, but it has been named a historic site. History Born in 1847, Rudolph Pretzinger emigrated to the United States with his parents at the age of seven and settled in Dayton. The death of his father in 1863 prompted him to undertake man's work, whereupon he earned a pharmacy degree and began a career that culminated in his ownership of a prominent downtown drugstore, a position in which he remained until his 1909 death.Drury, A.W. History of the City of Dayton and Montgomery County, Ohio. Chicago and Dayton: S.J. Clarke, 1909. Pretzinger's American-born younger brother Albert, one of Dayton's leading architects, designed the house, which was completed in 1889. The property was the focus of a tax lawsuit in 1900: having paid his share of the cost of paving Wyoming Street along his property in 1894, Pretzinger refused to pay for the cost of a sidewalk on the property's Main Street side in 1896, based on his interpretation of an Ohio law forbidding repeated taxation of a property for street improvements within a five-year period.Ohio State Reports. Vol. 63: January Term, 1900. Columbus, Ohio Supreme Court, 1900. While the Montgomery County court ruled in his favor, the case was reversed on appeal to the circuit court, but Pretzinger was ultimately victorious on appeal to the Supreme Court. Following Pretzinger's death, the property remained the home of his widow. Architecture Pretzinger's house is two and a half stories tall, with access through an arched doorway in the center of the facade; although the southern side is longer than the facade, it is pierced by only four windows and no doorways, versus five and one in the facade. A hip roof covers the house, interrupted at points by small gables with miniature Palladian windows. The northwestern corner of the house is a three-story tower with windows on each story, topped with a conical roof. Limestone was used to construct the foundation and for other exterior elements, and the walls are brick and the roof asphalt., Ohio Historical Society, 2015. Accessed 2015-12-25. Together, these elements lend the house a Queen Anne appearance. Historic site In 1979, the Rudolph Pretzinger House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. While the house remains at the intersection of Main and Apple Streets, as it was during Pretzinger's lifetime, the property no longer extends south to Wyoming; most of his land is now the site of Miami Valley Hospital.Directions to Miami Valley Hospital, Miami Valley Hospital, n.d.

He is the author of two full-length science fiction epic poems, The New World and Genesis; several books of poetry; and a number of other works. He has been called \\"a major poet of our time\\". Early life and education Born in Northamptonshire, England, Turner is the son of British cultural anthropologists Victor Witter Turner and Edith Turner. He had four siblings. His brothers include scientist Robert Turner and anthropologist Rory Turner, who teaches at Goucher College in Towson, Maryland. In an interview with William Baer, Turner recalled, \\"In fact, my father was a poet, but he chose to be an anthropologist to put food on the family table. He used to say to me that I'd become a poet because he's always wanted to be one.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 185. Childhood in Africa In 1952, Turner's father accepted an assignment funded by the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute to study the Eastern Ndembu people of Northern Rhodesia. While talking with Baer, Turner recalled the voyage, \\"...it was a marvellous seven days on the ocean, sailing down the Atlantic Ocean and seeing Ascension Island and all the other sights along the way.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 184. Turner further recalls, \\"In Africa, we lived mostly in grass huts. They were wonderful, with a smoky hay kind of smell... We would truck in supplies occasionally, and there was a small trading center called Mwinilunga, which had a few stores. We also bought a lot of bush meat, mostly goat and antelope, from the local people.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 184. While growing up in Africa, Turner was homeschooled by his parents. He recalls, \\"My parents had the addresses of several secondhand bookstores - which had various catalogues - so we ordered from Africa. As a boy, I read all the politically incorrect books! Lots of Kipling and Rider Haggard and all of Stevenson, like Treasure Island and The Master of Ballantrae.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 184. When asked if these were the books his father read in aloud in the evenings, Turner replied, \\"Yes, and then I would reread them by myself: The Swiss Family Robinson, Kim, and The Jungle Book, of course. Later on, when it started coming out, he read us The Lord of the Rings series. I think he read it three times, and then I read it five or six more times on my own. Eventually, we also read C.S. Lewis' Narnia, John Buchan, Arthur Conan Doyle, some Dickens, and lots of Shakespeare.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 185. Education He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School, which was at the time, after Eton College, \\"one of the two best schools in England.\\" Baer (2016), page 187. Between 1962 and 1967, Turner attended the University of Oxford, where he obtained the degrees of B.A., M.A., and B.Litt. in English Language and Literature. At Oxford, Turner's thesis supervisor was Helen Gardner. Turner's other examiners were Lord David Cecil and John Bayley, the husband of novelist Iris Murdoch. Baer (2016), page 188. The title of Turner's thesis was Shakespeare and the Nature of Time, which was later published at Gardner's insistence. Baer (2016), page 188. After moving to the United States and working there, he was naturalized in 1977 as a U.S. citizen. Marriage and family He has been married to Mei Lin Turner, whom he met at Oxford University, since 1966 and has two sons. Turner has, according to William Baer, \\"written numerous love poems,\\" addressed to his wife, such as The Mei Lin Effect. William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 195. Career Turner is Founders Professor of Arts and Humanities at the University of Texas at Dallas. Previous academic positions included the University of California, Santa Barbara (assistant professor 1967-72), Kenyon College (associate professor 1972-85), and the University of Exeter in England (visiting professor 1984-85). Between 1979 and 1983, Turner and Ronald Sharp served as editors of The Kenyon Review, where they published both the poems and the essays of the first New Formalist poets.William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Page 238. Writing in the early 2000s, James Matthew Wilson wrote, \\"Turner has spent several decades engaged on a consciously syncretistic quest to draw the findings of neuroscience, physics, anthropology, and Eastern and Western religions into a coherent vision of culture and the world as they shape and are shaped by human nature. As Turner argued in A Culture of Hope (1995), this quest is neither Liberal or Conservative, but one that shared the best insights of both. He views liberalism and Capitalism as indicative of human nature's dynamic, iconoclastic but also inventive, culture-making character, while he believes with Conservatives that the cultural productions that most befit human nature will always be Classical in character, though a Classicism renovated by human choices in every age. The argument for this position was first set forth in the aptly titled Natural Classicism (1986)...\\" James Matthew Wilson (2016), The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking, Wiseblood Books. Pages 83-84. During the early 1980s, Turner began to research, according to William Baer, how, \\"modern science has discovered that regular rhythm actually induces the brain to release pleasure-creating endorphins.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 192. Turner's interest in the subject began when he joined the International Society for the Study of Time. In an interview with Baer, Turner recalled, \\"Why do we find things beautiful? Why do we have the capacity to experience beauty? And why is this phenomenon so pan-cultural? Once we had the facts at our disposal, it was impossible to entertain any of these post- structuralist notions that such human forms and conventions are simply closed systems and culturally unique. In fact, it was clear that human aesthetic rose from human biology. Anyway, this subgroup got a grant from the Werner-Reimers- Stiftung, and we were able to involve even more interesting people from other disciplines ranging from physics to anthropology to music. So we began meeting over a nine-year period, and that was where our ideas about the neural lyre initiated.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 192-193. Of his work with German psychologist and neuroscientist Ernst P√∂ppel, who then worked for the Max Planck Institute in Munich, West Germany, Turner said, \\"Now Ernst had already been a member of the time society, so we'd known each other for quite a while, and we used to hang out in the bar and talk about all sorts of things. At the same time, I'd already embarked on a serious study of world meter, and I'd noticed that all human societies had poetry, that it was always divided into lines, and that, even in pre-literate societies, all the lines were about three seconds long. Ernst had similarly noticed that humans have a three second cycle in which we hear and understand language... So there was clearly some kind of three-second phenomenon going on. Then we hooked up with a group of bio-genetic structuralists who'd been studying, for instance, the neurophysiology of ritual chants, and we'd examined the effects of ritual chanting and learned that ritual chanting produces significant changes in the brain waves, so we started to put a lot of things together, and we wrote that essay.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 193. In 1985, Turner and P√∂ppel published their findings in the award-winning essay The Neural Lyre: Poetic Meter, the Brain, and Time in the magazine Poetry. William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Page 238. Writing As a poet Turner uses the longer genres, the narrative, science fiction, and strict metrical forms. He is a winner of the Milan Fust Prize (shared with Zsuzsanna Ozsv√°th) and the Levinson Poetry Prize, awarded by Poetry Magazine (1983). He has been described as \\"a universal scholar - a rare find in a world of over- specialization - whose work transects and borrows from several rather disparate fields.\\" Epic poetry Turner has published two epic poems which are also science fiction novels in verse. The first is his 1985 poem The New World, which celebrates world culture in the year 2376 A.D..William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 196. According to James Matthew Wilson, Turner's vision of the future in The New World, \\"is at once dystopian and utopian. The quest to exploit natural resources and develop advanced technology has led to the fragmentation of nation states into hostile,tribal factions,but it has also led some of these factions to attain a high level of civilization.\\" James Matthew Wilson (2016), The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking, Wiseblood Books. Page 84. Also according to Wilson, \\"Entire segments of the American population, dubbed 'Riots', now live as 'liberated' crazed addicts of drugs and violence, others lose themselves in a fundamentalist Christian Jihad. And yet, it seems that these developments allow Turner to dramatize a theme that has come to be a focus of much of his work: the way in which nature, the material world, shapes and is shaped by the cultural made world.\\" James Matthew Wilson (2016), The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking, Wiseblood Books. Page 85. Turner's second epic is the 1990 poem Genesis, which is heavily influenced by Greek Mythology and is about the human colonization of Mars.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 195. Genesis has not only, according to Turner, done well in terms of sales, \\"it's even been adopted by NASA.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 196. When asked about his decision to write epic poetry, Turner replied, \\"People are willing to read novels, and they're willing to read the classic epics. I suspect that Robert Fitzgerald's wonderful translation of The Odyssey has been ready by as many people as most contemporary novels. So I don't think that there's anything wrong with the form itself; it's rather a problem of old-fashioned expectations, along with the general incompetence with which it's usually done in our times - when it's done at all. Also, the perceived difficulty of modern poetry is a problem. If readers struggle with a short modern poem, they'll often dread the idea of reading a 200-page poem, but if it's crafted correctly and really tells a story,then it isn't a problem. You can read Fitzgerald's Odyssey more easily than most novels, it's much more direct.\\" William Baer (2016), page 196. Literary translation In an interview, William Baer asked Turner about his 1992 collection of translated poems by Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti, a Hungarian Jewish poet, convert to Roman Catholicism, and critic of the Arrow Cross Party, who was murdered by the Royal Hungarian Army during the Holocaust.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 200. Turner responded, \\"One day, one of Radn√≥ti's friends saw him on the streets of Budapest, and the poet was mumbling something like, 'Du-duh-du-duh-du-duh,' and his friend said, 'Don't you understand?! Hitler is invading Poland!' And Radn√≥ti supposedly answered, 'Yes, but this is the only thing I have to fight with.' As his poetry makes clear, Radn√≥ti believed that Fascism was the destruction of order. It both destroyed and vulgarized civil society. It was as if you wanted to create an ideal cat, so you took your cat, killed it, removed its flesh, put it into some kind of mold, and then pressed it into the shape of a cat. That's what Fascism does, and that's what Communism does. They both destroy an intricate social order to set up a criminally simple-minded order.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 200-201. About his work alongside his co-translator Zsuzsanna Ozsv√°th, Turner said, \\"Well, we made an agreement right from the start that we would maintain the Hungarian formats. We also wanted to capture the sound of the Hungarian, which is quite unusual. Fortunately, Hungarian poets use a lot of meters and forms that we also use. Iambs and sonnets, for example, but the language has many more trochees and dactyls, and the Hungarians often combine the two rhythms in fascinating ways, and ways that work extremely well in English. As George Steiner once said, Hungarian poems shouldn't sound like American poems. So we worked hard to create the Hungarian sounds.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 201. When asked about his translations of Chinese poetry, particularly poems dating from the Tang Dynasty, Turner commented, \\"That was quite a bit more difficult, but eventually I realized that the Chinese syllable is roughly equivalent to two syllables in English, and that made things much easier. Chinese poetry needs to be recited much slower than English poetry, and when a line of Chinese poetry has five syllables, it will probably take ten syllables to render it into English. Whenever I translate, whether from the Hungarian or the Chinese, I always listen to the poem recited first. Then I write a 'score' for the poem, marking stresses, and the rhyme scheme, and the cadence, and so forth.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 201-202. Religious poetry When asked about his own religious poetry, Turner said, \\"In the 20th century, it became more and more frowned on to advertise your religious views. Partly it was a reaction against the 'tolerant hypocrisy' of the Victorians, but the primary reason, of course, was the intellectual fashion of the death of God. You really couldn't be a respectable thinker unless you made an act of faith that there is nothing but matter in the world. We now know,of course, from countless scientific discoveries, that matter itself has a relatively late appearance in the universe, and if the universe looks like anything,it looks like a gigantic thought, which Eddington claimed a long time ago. The best metaphor for the universe is not a gigantic machine, but rather a thought, which from a theological point of view is perfectly reasonable. But there's still a lot of pressure to conform in the arts and academia, and it also has professional ramifications. People could certainly lose their jobs for expressing themselves like Hopkins, Dickinson, or Milton - or they wouldn't get those jobs in the first place.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 197. Reviews and commentary *\\"In Hadean Eclogues, Frederick Turner..., an interdisciplinary scholar and devotee of the classics, searches for a modern Arcadia, the sacred and taboo gateway between heaven and Earth that inspired the poets of old. He finds it in a startling place - the emerging suburbs in the cities of his adopted home, Texas.\\" --Minneapolis Star-Tribune *Genesis, an Epic Poem, by Frederick Turner... (It) doesn‚Äôt seem like an epic poem about the terraforming of Mars, using characters modeled partly on Greek mythology, would be a recipe for success. But Turner is an exceptionally skillful poet, who when he wrote this book had already completed a fascinating Mars novel, A Double Shadow (1978), and another fine book-length narrative poem, The New World (1985). Here, the Olympian grandeur of the characters and plot match well with the Martian landscape, which under its rapid terraforming is still recognizably a place established in the popular imagination by the Viking landers. The result is a triumph that deserves to be better known.\\" --IEEE Spectrum References External links *Official Website Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:American male poets Category:American Roman Catholic poets Category:American science fiction writers Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Academics of the University of Exeter Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:Chinese‚ÄìEnglish translators Category:English Catholic poets Category:English science fiction writers Category:Hungarian‚ÄìEnglish translators Category:Kenyon College faculty Category:People from Northamptonshire Category:Science fiction writers Category:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty Category:University of Texas at Dallas faculty ","title":"Frederick Turner (poet)"},{"id":"24183910","text":"Future Knight is a 2D, flip screen platform game released by Gremlin Graphics in 1986 for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.

The poetry was recorded England and the music three days earlier in Paris. Ok, weirdness aside (and it is weird hearing Taylor's voice multi-tracked), the band is stellar... Taylor is leading the charge and all of these players know how to follow him, down an improvisatory highway that leads straight into a darkness beyond language. And perhaps, as he re-enters with his poetry at the very end of the work, that's what it's about anyway, going beyond language, ever beyond the place where it occurs to the place where it is conceived in spoken word and in music, which is but an extension of the human voice\\".Jurek, T.

He was born at Montreal and died at Rivi√®re-du-Loup. Bertrand came to the priesthood after his wife died and having no children, felt the need for a new vocation. He was ordained by Bishop Jean-Olivier Briand at the age of 34. In his first parish, the church was destroyed by fire and in the resulting turmoil over re-building, he became unhappy with the situation and asked for a transfer. In 1786, he was assigned to the parish at Rivi√®re-du-Loup by Bishop Louis-Philippe Mariauchau d‚ÄôEsgly. He appears to have been rather authoritarian and drew more attention than was normal for a parish priest. His importance to history revolves around the construction of another church and more specifically the land on which it was to be built. Father Bertrand sued the man who was to provide land for the church of a new parish and disputed the Church's authority to create said parish and require land for a church. There was a protracted legal battle which was eventually produced a ruling against the Church. The lawsuit had raised questions about the Roman Catholic Church and its legal status after the conquest. Although the ruling did not explicitly state the fact, it set precedent for the future in creating parishes in Quebec. Joseph-Laurent Bertrand had lost a case but his tenacity in pursuing the best interests of his parishes made him a respected community and religious leader.

Taylor performed all of the vocal and instrumental parts, which are overdubbed. Brief background Chinampas was recorded at Doodlehums Studio in London on November 16 and 17, 1987, in sessions that overlapped with the recording of the spoken sections of Tzotzil/Mummers/Tzotzil, which also feature Taylor's poetry. According to Taylor, Chinampas is \\"about those extraordinary Aztecs\\", whom he referred to as his \\"distant relatives\\". (Chinampa is an Aztec word referring to an agricultural technique involving the use of artificial islands which are sometimes called \\"floating gardens\\".) Unlike other Taylor albums, on Chinampas the title of each track is simply its duration in minutes and seconds. When asked how much of Chinampas was improvised, Taylor replied: \\"None of it. What was improvised were the instruments. What is also improvised is how the voice is used.\\" In response to a series of questions regarding the overdubbing process, including \\"Do you hear all the voices at once, all the sounds? How do you go about layering sounds?\\", Taylor traced his influences back to his youth: \\"when I was like ten or eleven years old, mother... took me to hear all the bands. So that when I would come home, and I'd go into my room, I would imitate with my voice. I would make orchestral sounds, I would hear all of this in my head. I could make certain sounds that would be the trumpet, certain sounds would be the saxophone.\\" Reaction David Grubbs wrote: \\"On Chinampas, the individual pieces move in beautifully modulated long arcs of sometimes frenetic activity not unlike his solo piano concerts and recordings; they travel from the lowest register of speaking voice to the highest range of squeaking voice... the artist... less signaling through the flames than forcing air through an increasingly constricted windpipe, pitch ascending all the while... the voice leaping sufficiently and uncannily high so as to sound at a handful of especially chilling moments like a panicked child... Occasionally a word is hammered into the ground through repetition, an obsessive handling or worrying or hectoring interrogation of a single note on the piano, a tremolo, that mocking tone, that perhaps self-mocking tone that ironizes, defamiliarizes ‚Äî a technique for a favored subject: transformations that occur through natural physical processes, in one of Chinampas's resonant phrases, 'one mineral crystallizing into another.'\\" AllMusic reviewer Thom Jurek wrote: \\"To address what these poems are about is a meaningless endeavor. It would be the same as trying to explain what his piano playing is about. It's all language; it's all music. In fact, these poems... tell the story of Taylor's approach to making music, creating solid matter from thin air, and then -- like the true shaman that he is -- transforming it into sand and blowing it away to make room for something else.\\" He continued: \\"Taylor is making a new history in his poetics: one that comes from pre-Babylonian Egypt and extends into the centuries beyond this one, one that insists in communicating in a language that is only dotted with references to Western culture and its ideologies as a jumping-off point in both directions simultaneously. And to hear the moans, groans, giggles, squeaks, and peeps that come from a master of the trained voice is to hear these sounds -- interspersed as they are with words and phrases and percussive meanderings -- as part of the language we speak (even if we've never heard it before).\\" He concluded: \\"As an artist Mr. Taylor has gone where few have gone before him, let alone succeeded; this is what he is used to. But he may have surprised even himself in the sheer musicality of his mystical universal tome.\\" Poet and author Fred Moten, whose collection The Feel Trio is named after Taylor's trio with William Parker and Tony Oxley, wrote about the first section of Chinampas in his essay \\"Sound in Florescence (Cecil Taylor Floating Garden)\\". He describes the work as \\"A poetry... that is of the music; a poetry that would articulate the music's construction; a poetry that would mark and question the idiomatic difference that is the space-time of performance, ritual, and event; a poetry, finally, that becomes music in that it iconically presents those organizational principles that are the essence of music.\\" Moten suggests that the listener \\"Let Taylor‚Äôs 'musicked' speech and illegible words resonate and give some attention to their broken grammar, the aural rewriting of grammatical rule that is not simply arbitrary but a function of the elusive content he would convey,\\" and states that \\"the spoken words, the speaking of the words, are not an arbitrary feature but are instead constitutive of that which is not but nothing other than (the improvisation of) ritual, writing, ritual as a form of writing.\\" Moten asks: \\"What kind of writing is Chinampas? Taylor presents no graphic system ‚Äî if Chinampas is writing, it is so in the absence of visuality. Under what conditions, then, could Chinampas be called 'writing'? Perhaps within an understanding of writing more broadly conceived as nonverbal, as well as verbal, systems of graphic communication... It's not that Taylor creates visible speech; rather his is an aural writing given an understanding of writing that includes nonverbal graphic resources.\\" He writes that Taylor \\"works the anarchic irruption and interruption of grammar, enacting a phrasal improvisation through the distinction between poetry and music in the poetry of music, the programmatic manifesto that accompanies the music, that becomes music and turns music into poetry.\\"  Track listing  All compositions by Cecil Taylor # ‚Äì 5.04 # ‚Äì 3.43 # ‚Äì 5.46 # ‚Äì 5.07 # ‚Äì 12.30 # ‚Äì 9.20 # ‚Äì 5.46 # ‚Äì 6.56 # ‚Äì 3.36  Personnel  * Cecil Taylor ‚Äì poetry, voice, tympani, bells, percussion  References  Category:1988 albums Category:Cecil Taylor albums Category:Leo Records albums ","title":"Chinampas (album)"},{"id":"24184033","text":"R.

Germany had threatened to attack New York with V-1 flying bombs and rocket U-boats. After the war, it was determined the submarines had not been carrying either. Operation Teardrop was planned during late 1944 in response to intelligence reports which indicated that Germany was preparing a force of missile-armed submarines. Two large U.S. Navy anti-submarine warfare task forces were set up. The plan was executed in April 1945 after several Type IX submarines put to sea from Norway bound for North America. While severe weather conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean greatly reduced the effectiveness of the four U.S. Navy escort carriers involved, long patrol lines of destroyer escorts detected and engaged most of the German submarines. Aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force supported this effort. Five of the seven submarines in the group stationed off the United States were sunk, four with their entire crews. Thirty-three crew members were captured, and specialists among them abusively interrogated. One destroyer escort was sunk, with the loss of most of her crew. The war ended shortly afterwards and all surviving U-boats surrendered; interrogation of their crews found that missile launching equipment was not fitted.  Background  In late 1944, the Allies received intelligence reports which suggested that Germany's Kriegsmarine was planning to use launched from submarines to attack cities on the east coast of the United States. In September of that year, Oscar Mantel, a spy captured by the U.S. Navy when the submarine transporting him to Maine was sunk, told his FBI interrogators that several missile-equipped U-boats were being readied. United States Tenth Fleet analysts subsequently examined photos of unusual mountings on U-boats at bases in Norway, but concluded that they were wooden tracks used to load torpedoes. Further rumors of missile-armed submarines emerged later that year, including one from Sweden passed on by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. The British Admiralty discounted these reports, and assessed that while V-1s could be potentially mounted on Type IX submarines, the Germans were unlikely to devote scarce resources to such a project. V-1 at Imperial War Museum Duxford Despite the Tenth Fleet and Admiralty assessments, the U.S. military and government remained concerned that Germany would conduct vengeance attacks against East Coast cities. In early November 1944, the Eastern Sea Frontier mounted an intensive search for submarines within of New York City. In early December 1944, the spies William Curtis Colepaugh and Erich Gimpel, who had been captured in New York City after being landed by in Maine, told their interrogators that Germany was preparing a group of rocket-equipped submarines. On 10 December, the Mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, publicly warned that Germany was considering an attack on New York with long-range rockets. La Guardia's warning and the claims made by the captured spies received considerable media coverage. Despite this, the Department of War, which was dominated by the United States Army, advised President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 11 December that the threat of missile attack was so low that it did not justify the diversion of resources from other tasks. This assessment was not supported by the U.S. Navy. In response to the perceived threat, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders and missiles. This plan was originally code-named Operation Bumblebee, and later renamed Operation Teardrop. Completed on 6 January 1945, the plan involved U.S. Navy anti-submarine forces as well as United States Army Air Forces and Army units, which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft and missiles. The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces to operate in the mid-Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast. These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups, and used Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, as their forward operating base. As well as guarding against missile attacks, these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high-performance Type XXI submarines if they began operating in the central Atlantic. The Atlantic Fleet's commander, Vice Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, gave a press conference on 8 January in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers. In January 1945, German Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer made a propaganda broadcast in which he claimed that V-1 and V-2s \\"would fall on New York by February 1, 1945\\", increasing the U.S. Government's concern over the threat of attack. However, the Germans had no ability to fire missiles from their submarines, as both attempts to develop submarine-launched rockets ended in failure. In June 1942, was used to trial small and short-ranged artillery rockets which could be fired while submerged. Development of this system ended in early 1943, as it was found to decrease the U-boats' seaworthiness. The German military also began the development of a U-boat-towed launch canister for the V-2 ballistic missile in November 1944. Once complete, these canisters were to be towed to a position off the United States east coast and be used to attack New York. Vulkan Docks in Stettin was contracted to build a prototype in March or April 1945, but little work took place before Germany's final collapse. It is unlikely that the system would have been successful if it had been completed.  Battle   Initial deployments  anchored off New York City in October 1945 Nine Type IX U-boats were dispatched from Norway to patrol off Canada and the United States in March 1945 and attack shipping. The purpose of this deployment was to divert Allied anti-submarine forces away from the coastal waters of the United Kingdom. These waters were the main operational area for German submarines in early 1945, but heavy casualties had forced the German navy to break off operations in late March. On 12 April, , , , , , and were designated \\"Gruppe Seewolf\\" and ordered to attack shipping from New York southwards. The remaining two boats, and , were directed to Canadian waters. The Allies were aware of this force's departure and destination through information gathered from Enigma decrypts. Vice Admiral Ingram and the U.S. Tenth Fleet concluded that the boats in Gruppe Seewolf were carrying V-1s and launched Teardrop in response. The ships of the First Barrier Force, which comprised escort carriers and and 20 destroyer escorts, sortied from Hampton Roads between 25 and 27 March, proceeded to Argentia to refuel and assembled east of Cape Race on 11 April. Twelve of the destroyer escorts deployed into a line long while the two carriers, each protected by four destroyer escorts, sailed to the west of the line. The carriers' air operations were, however, greatly hindered by heavy seas. The rough weather also forced the cancellation of planned memorial services for President Roosevelt after his death on 12 April. As it sailed west, Gruppe Seewolf was ordered to attack shipping by U-boat Command. The boats found no targets, however, as the Allies had routed convoys to the south to avoid the submarines and severe weather. The German submarines began to reach their initial stations east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on 8 April. U-Boat Command assigned Gruppe Seewolf 12 different scouting lines between 2 and 19 April. The radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by the Allies, providing them with accurate information on where the boats were operating.  First Barrier Force actions  Just before midnight on 15 April, made radar contact with U-1235 at a position about north of Flores Island. She immediately attacked the submarine with her hedgehog anti- submarine mortar, but the submarine submerged and escaped. Assisted by , Stanton quickly gained sonar contact with the submarine and made three more hedgehog attacks. The third attack, which was conducted at 00:33 on 16 April, sank the submarine with the loss of her entire crew. Shortly afterwards Frost detected U-880 by radar as she attempted to flee the area on the surface. After illuminating the submarine with star shell and spotlights, the destroyer escort opened fire on her with Bofors 40 mm guns from a range of at 02:09. U-880 quickly submerged but was tracked by Stantons and Frosts sonar operators. The two American ships made several hedgehog attacks on the submarine, with Stanton sinking her with no survivors at 04:04. Both submarines suffered huge explosions after being struck by hedgehog projectiles. This further raised the fear that they were carrying rockets and motivated the First Barrier Force to intensify its efforts to destroy the remaining U-boats. The First Barrier Force maneuvered south westward following the destruction of U-1235 and U-880. Leigh Light-equipped B-24 Liberators from VPB-114 spotted U-805 on the surface during the nights of 18‚Äì19 April. The submarine was only from Mission Bay and her escorts, but was not attacked as the aircraft could not confirm whether she was hostile before she submerged. On the night of 20 April, U-546 attempted to torpedo a U.S. destroyer escort, but missed. The following night, U-805 was detected by , but escaped after being depth charged by Mosley, and for two hours. The First Barrier Force scored its final success on the night of 21‚Äì22 April. Just before midnight, detected U-518 with sonar. joined her and made the initial hedgehog attack on the submarine. Following this, Carter made her own hedgehog run, which sank U-518 with no survivors. By this time, the First Barrier Force was returning to Argentia, after the Second Barrier Force had relieved it. Even though Teardrop was undertaken in the part of the North Atlantic for which Canada had primary responsibility, Ingram did not seek assistance from the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) at any stage of the engagement. Moreover, Ingram did not provide the Canadian military with a situation report until after the sinking of U-518. However, aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) flew offensive patrols in support of the American effort, and the RCN and RCAF intensified their patrols of inshore waters around Halifax.  Second Barrier Force actions  The Second Barrier Force comprised escort carriers and and 22 destroyer escorts. Bogue and 10 destroyer escorts had sailed from Quonset on 16 April, while Core and 12 destroyer escorts sailed from Bermuda and other locations. The force was initially stationed along the 45th meridian in a patrol line long, and sailed towards the east. This line was made up of 14 destroyer escorts sailing at intervals, with Core and her four escorts at its northern end and Bogue and her four escorts at the southern end. On the night of 22‚Äì23 April, U-boat Command dissolved Gruppe Seewolf and directed the three surviving boats to take up stations between New York and Halifax. Shortly afterwards, , and , which had been operating separately, were also ordered to positions between New York and Cape Hatteras. Radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by Allied code breakers and increased fears that the submarines were trying to attack American cities. The Second Barrier Force encountered its first U-boat on 23 April when a Grumman TBF Avenger from VC-19 sighted U-881 about north west of Bogue just after noon. The aircraft dropped depth charges, but did not seriously damage the submarine. This was the first attack made by an aircraft during Teardrop. Kapit√§nleutnant Just aboard Bogue The next day, sighted Core and maneuvered to attack the escort carrier. She attempted to pass through the barrier line but was detected by at 08:30, which immediately prepared to attack the submarine. After realizing that his boat had been detected U-546s commander, Kapit√§nleutnant Paul Just, fired a T-5 acoustic torpedo at the destroyer escort from a range of . Frederick C. Davis Foxer decoy was not effective, and the torpedo struck her forward engine room at 0835. She sank five minutes later with the loss of 126 of her 192 crewmen. Eight American destroyer escorts subsequently hunted U-546 for almost 10 hours, before severely damaged her with a hedgehog salvo. The submarine immediately surfaced, but sank after Flaherty and three or four other destroyer escorts fired at it. Kapit√§nleutnant Just and 32 other crewmen survived the sinking and were taken prisoner. Some of U-546s survivors were harshly treated in an attempt to force them to divulge whether the submarines bound for the U.S. east coast were carrying missiles. After brief interviews on board Bogue, the survivors were transferred to the U.S. base at Argentia. Upon arrival on 27 April, the prisoners were screened for interrogation, with eight specialists being separated from the other 25 survivors, who were then sent to prisoner of war camps. The specialists were held in solitary confinement and subjected to \\"shock interrogation\\" techniques, exhausting physical exercise and beatings. On 30 April, Kapit√§nleutnant Just provided brief information on Gruppe Seewolf's composition and mission following a second interview in which he collapsed unconscious. The information provided by Just and the other specialists did not mention whether the submarines were equipped with missiles. The eight men were transferred to Fort Hunt, Virginia shortly after VE Day, where they continued to be harshly treated until Just agreed to write an account of U-546s history on 12 May. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating of U-546s survivors was a \\"singular atrocity\\" motivated by the interrogators' need to promptly extract information on potential missile attacks. The Second Barrier Force slowly moved south west from 24 April, searching for the remaining U-boats. made radar contact with a submarine on the night of 24 April, but it escaped during the resulting search. After a week of searching south of the Newfoundland Banks, the barrier force was split on 2 May to provide greater depth. The Mission Bay group reinforced the Second Barrier Force during this period, bringing its strength to three escort carriers and thirty one destroyer escorts. U-881 became the fifth and final U-boat to be sunk during Teardrop on 5 May. The boat was detected while attempting to pass submerged through the barrier line by shortly before daybreak. The destroyer escort immediately turned to starboard and dropped depth charges, which sank the submarine with no survivors at 0616. U-881 was the last German submarine to be sunk by the U.S. Navy during World War II. The Second Barrier Force established its final barrier line along the 60th meridian on 7 May. Following the end of World War II in Europe that day, it accepted the surrender of , U-805, U-858 and at sea before returning to bases on the U.S. east coast.  Aftermath  A \\"Loon\\" is fired from in 1951 After the German surrender the U.S. Navy continued its efforts to determine whether the U-boats had carried missiles. The crews of U-805 and U-858 were interrogated and confirmed that their boats were not fitted with missile launching equipment. Kapit√§nleutnant Fritz Steinhoff, who had commanded U-511 during her rocket trials and was captured at sea when he surrendered , was subjected to an abusive interrogation at Portsmouth by the interviewers of U-546s crew. An official Navy investigation was held into this interrogation after Steinhoff committed suicide at Charles Street Jail in Boston shortly afterwards. It is not known if the Allies were aware of Steinhoff's involvement in the rocket trials. The tactics used in Teardrop were evaluated by U.S. Navy officers after the war. The escort carriers' air wings were disappointed with their experience, as their ability to detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation. Despite this, the aircraft were successful in forcing the U-boats to remain submerged, thereby greatly slowing their speed. Other after action reports stressed the importance of teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas. Nevertheless, Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as \\"a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics, derived in part from British experience, but also of the profound impact of communications intelligence in the interdiction of U-boat transit and operating areas.\\" Similarly, the British official history of the role intelligence played in World War II noted that information obtained from decrypted German radio transmissions contributed to \\"virtually all\\" of the sinkings during Teardrop. A variant of the V-1 was used by the U.S. Navy to test the feasibility of launching missiles from submarines in the years after World War II. Republic‚ÄêFord JB‚Äê2 \\"Loon\\" missiles were launched from and in a series of tests which began on February 12, 1947. These tests were successful, and led to the development of further submarine-launched cruise missiles. The U.S. Navy's success in adapting a variant of the V-1 to be launched from submarines also demonstrated that it would have been technically feasible for the German navy to have done the same.

It was recorded by The Quintet of the Hot Club of France in 1937. It was recorded five other times throughout Reinhardt's career and is considered to be one of his signature compositions. The composition was first released as a 78 single by Swing in 1937 with Django Reinhardt and St√©phane Grappelli in the Quintette du Hot Club de France. Structure Minor Swing is written in the key of A minor. Apart from the brief introduction and final coda or playout, there is no discernable melody, just a repeated sequence of chord changes over which the key players improvise continuously until by some mutual agreement the end is decided and the playout performed. The introduction comprises a set of partial arpeggios over the chords Am/Dm/Am/Dm/Am/Dm/E7, followed by the main changes which are Am/-/Dm/-/E7/-/Am/-/ which are followed by Dm/-/Am/-/E7/-/Am/E7/, then the cycle begins again, until the playout which comprises some set arpeggios following the pattern of the first half of the tune with one repeat. In some modern treatments, the E7 in the middle of the second stanza may be replaced with Bb7 (a tritone substitution) and/or the second stanza sometimes replaced with a cycle of fifths based treatment for effect, i.e. Dm7/G7/Cmaj7/Fmaj7/B√∏/E7/Am (etc.). Although the chord changes may appear unremarkable and the entire structure somewhat repetitive, in live performance it is a well known vehicle which permits the soloist or soloists to demonstrate their virtuosity and musical skill for creating interesting melodic and rhythmic excursions over the familiar chord patterns, as well as the opportunity to quote from Django's own recorded melodic inventions over his own tune.

He had a lengthy legal and political career in Charleston, South Carolina and served as the colonial chief justice from 1703 until 1719. He came from a prosperous English family; his grandfather Perient Trott having been a husband of the Somers Isles Company and his uncle Sir Nicholas Trott served as the governor of the Bahamas. Sir Nicholas, like his nephew, was also involved in dealings with pirates and, to avoid confusion, is often referred to as Nicholas the Elder. Though he is best known, as recorded in Daniel Defoe's A General History of the Pyrates, as the magistrate who tried notorious pirate Stede Bonnet in 1718, he was the author of several published books including a lexicon of the psalms Clavis Linguae Sanctae (1719), The Tryals of Major Stede Bonnet and Other Pirates (1719) and The Laws of the British Plantations (1721) for which he was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law degree from Oxford University and a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Aberdeen. His final published work, The Laws of the Province of South Carolina (1736), chronicled the early legal and judicial history of Charleston up until 1719. Biography Early life and legal career Nicholas Trott was born in Lewisham, London, England, to Samuel Trott, a successful London merchant. His grandfather, Perient Trott, was a husband of the Somers Isles Company, the chartered company which was involved in the early colonization of Bermuda. His uncle Sir Nicholas Trott (or Nicholas the Elder) served as governor of the Bahamas. Trott was educated at Merchant Taylor's School in London. In part due to his family's connections, he was appointed secretary to the Somers Isles Company and attorney general of Bermuda in 1693. He married his first wife, Jane Willis, in Bermuda a year later. In 1695, Trott became a member of the Inner Temple, one of London's four \\"Inns of Court\\" which served as a center of learning for training lawyers. Returned to Bermuda the following year, he took the office of attorney general and by all accounts \\"served ably\\" in that post. Chief justice in South Carolina In 1699, Trott left Bermuda for Charleston, South Carolina to become attorney general and naval officer in the colony. He had been offered this post by Edward Randolph, then surveyor general of the colonies. Trott's political and legal career was, while successful, also wrought with controversy due to his partisan political and religious views. His criticism of Joseph Blake, who had succeeded the previous governor John Archdale in 1696, resulted in Trott's arrest and removal from office. He was eventually restored to his former position by the colonial assembly in 1702 and was appointed chief justice the next year. An ardent supporter of the Church of England, he was early member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He was also involved with other Anglicans to establish the Church of England within the colony and suppress the religious dissenters. This religious factionalism ended with the appointment of Charles Craven in 1712. Trott, along with his brother-in-law William Rhett, both had considerable support within the colonial assembly and resisted Craven's policy of tolerance. Trott and Rhett may have been protected by Richard Shelton, another highly influential figure in the colony. For a period of four years, between 1711 and 1715, he and Rhett successfully sought to expand their powers though the Charleston electorate, the colonial governing body which elected the majority of the colonial assembly members. Trott visited England in 1714 where he was given \\"extraordinary legal powers\\" by the colony proprietors which included his right to appoint a provost marshal, though his presence was required in order to hold a quorum in the colonial council, and no additional laws could be passed without his approval. These powers were revoked two years later, however this did not prevent him from seeking to increase his power in the colony. By the time of his appointment as vice admiralty judge in 1716, he and Rhett controlled virtually all of the royal and proprietary offices in South Carolina. Trial of Stede Bonnett In 1718, Trott gained a certain degree of notoriety when he served as Vice Admiralty Judge during the trial of Captain Stede Bonnet and his crew. Trott published a transcript of the trial, entitled The Tryals of Major Stede Bonnet and Other Pirates, that provided extensive details of the trial and was included as a primary source document in prominent collections of state trials published in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His \\"comprehensive and detailed definition of piracy\\" was used by many other Vice Admiralty Judges of the day and helped shape the legal definition of piracy. His work was frequently cited in public international law into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Retirement and later years By 1719, Trott had become very unpopular among his contemporaries and a formal complaint to the colony proprietors was made against him that year. These charges included claims that \\"he collected exorbitant fees in his courts, multiplied fees by delays in the proceedings, abused his office as judge by advising parties in cases pending before him, and monopolized the colony's political and judicial offices\\". This coincided with the fall of the proprietary government that same year, although Trott and Rhett activities were not considered to have been a contributing factor. The main reasons for replacing the proprietary government was their perceived failure to protect the colony from Indian raiding parties. The English government agreed to provide the colony with adequate protection and sent Francis Nicholson to act as royal governor. Shortly after his arrival, he restored all former proprietary officials with Trott as the only exception. Trott petitioned to have his office restored but eventually gave up. Afterwards, Trott retired from public service and spent the rest of his life as a prolific legal scholar and writer. His works included, aside from his own memoirs of the Bonnet trial, a lexicon of the psalms Clavis Linguae Sanctae (1719) and The Laws of the British Plantations (1721). For these, he was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law degree by Oxford University in 1720 and a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Aberdeen in 1726. His last published work, The Laws of the Province of South Carolina (1736), included a collection of provincial laws during his time as colonial magistrate. It is considered one of the earliest and most important documents in early legal and judicial history of colonial South Carolina. After the death of Jane Willis, Trott married Sarah Rhett, the widow of William Rhett, in 1727. He spent the last years of his life, according to personal correspondence and his later obituary from the South Carolina Gazette, explicating the Hebrew text of the Bible which has apparently been lost. He died in London on 21 January 1740, at the age of 77. He left small bequests to his \\"two grandchildren Sarah and Mary Jane Rhett\\", descendants of his second wife by her first marriage, but apparently had no children of his own. Legacy Trott is considered to have been a highly important figure in the early history of South Carolina. Historian M. Eugene Sirmans has referred to him as \\"the most learned man in the colony\\". Aside from his involvement in the colonial assembly with William Rhett, Trott made important contributions to the legal development of South Carolina. His work as chief justice and later as a scholar illustrated the early development of American colonial law.

History Formerly known as Homer Hiccolm & the Rocketboys, the band formed late 2005 in Abilene, Texas. The original line-up met while they were attending Abilene Christian University. Singer Brandon Kinder entered the (at that time) informal group in a college battle-of-the-bands and needed a name. Homer Hiccolm & the Rocketboys, an idea inspired by the movie October Sky he had randomly had in mind for a while, was the first name to come to mind. In 2009, the band shortened their name to simply The Rocketboys after relocating to Austin, Texas where the band's members currently reside. In early 2009, drummer (and creator of P. Ellis Drums) Philip Ellis left the band. Replacing Ellis was Alex Bhore, former drummer of The New Frontiers. Bhore left the band, however, in fall 2010 to join This Will Destroy You full-time. Guitarists and original members Dan Wheeler and Mitch Holt also decided to part ways with the group in late 2010 to allocate more of their time to be home with their families and to pursue their other endeavors outside of the band. After a long writing period, remaining members Brandon, Josh, and Justin, along with new drummer Josh Rodgers, released \\"Build Anyway\\", in June 2012. The rest of 2012 and 2013 was spent on the road with bands such as Relient K, The Almost, The Mowgli's, Kopecky Family Band, Dinner and a Suit, and Mike Mains & the Branches. Their music continued to feature in numerous TV shows, indie movies and commercials. In 2014, The Rocketboys signed to Black Magnetic Records and recorded an EP with producer Joe Chiccarelli at Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood. The EP, \\"Left Right\\" was released January 6, 2015, to coincide with the use of their song \\"Viva Voce\\" in the final season of the TV show \\"Glee\\" where it was the signature song of new character \\"Roderick\\". Sing, Bird, Sing EP In May 2007, The Rocketboys spent several months recording their first studio EP, Sing, Bird, Sing. Once released, the EP was an immediate success and garnered impressive reviews from such media outlets as Paste Magazine, The Austin American-Statesman and HM Magazine. Songs like \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Do I Wake or Sleep?\\" became favorites and quickly pushed The Rocketboys into the regional spotlight. In January 2008, \\"Do I Wake or Sleep?\\", a song from the EP, appeared on the Paste Magazine sampler CD, and in 2010 several songs from the EP appeared on TV shows including Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Real World. 20,000 Ghosts In 2009 the band recorded its first full-length album, 20,000 Ghosts, which was engineered and produced by Louie Lino (Nada Surf, Matt Pond PA), mastered by Alan Douches (Sufjan Stevens, Animal Collective) and features artwork from Dark Was The Night artist, Ryan Feerer. In 2010, songs from the album were heard on The Real World, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and The Buried Life. Wellwisher In 2010, The Rocketboys garnered both musical and financial support from friends and fans to create its latest EP \\"Wellwisher\\". \\"Wellwisher\\" was recorded while on tour with Lydia in July and Death on Two Wheels in August 2010 by friend and touring FOH engineer Will Krienke (who was later assisted by Joey Benjamin). The band utilized many talented friends (such as BMI rep/violinist David Claassen, harpist/artist Timbre, England in 1819, the PASTE Magazine staff, and a church choir in Memphis) along the way in locations ranging from the van to living rooms to professional studios. Financially the project was backed by fans using Kickstarter where fans were encouraged to donate money to fund in the album in exchange for creative incentives ranging from tickets to shows to having the band cover a song of the backer's choosing. Singer Brandon Kinder described \\"Wellwisher\\" not as a concept album but a concept experience. The musical collaboration, nomadic recording process, and communal funding of the project combined with the lyrical themes of unity, brotherhood and relationships, all contributed to and exuded from the final product. Build Anyway Following the departure of two founding members of the group (Dan Wheeler & Mitch Holt) the band debated continuing. Kinder focused on a side project, \\"The Wealthy West\\" and wrote several tracks for TV & movies but eventually the three remaining members began testing out new material throughout the fall of 2011. Recording in their own studio and enlisting mixer CJ Eiriksson (U2, Phish), the band completed \\"Build Anyway\\" in April 2012 and released it on June 5th, 2012. Left Right Signing with Black Magnetic Records (whose other artists include A Great Big World and Dead Sara), the band recorded 4 tracks with Joe Chiccarelli at Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, CA. during June 2014. The resulting EP, \\"Left Right\\" was released January 6, 2015 Touring Over the past several years, The Rocketboys have toured nationally with The Mowgli's, Kopecky Family Band, Relient K, and The Almost, and have played shows both locally and nationally with many acclaimed bands/artists such as Eisley, Bob Schneider, Grizzly Bear, Twenty One Pilots, The Octopus Project, This Will Destroy You, The Appleseed Cast, Lydia, Balmorhea, and St. Vincent, to name a few. In addition, The Rocketboys have appeared at festivals nationwide such as Austin City Limits, Suburbia Fest, Next Big Nashville, South By Southwest, Bragg Jam, Fareveller, CMJ, and Cornerstone Festival. TV licensing The Rocketboys, and Kinder (both solo and under the moniker \\"The Wealthy West\\") have had numerous songs on TV shows including \\"Private Practice\\" The Real World Washington, D.C. ,The Buried Life, Glee, Royals, Last Sparks Of Sundown, One Tree Hill and many more.

(2003). International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas. p. 595, 866. Routledge: New York. ; OCLC 54061586 The treaty's short name is a portmanteau of Tokelau and Olohega (, the Tokelauan name of Swains Island), which the boundary separates. History Swains Island was initially settled by Polynesians and later conquered by Tokelauans from Fakaofo. In 1856, while populated by Tokelauans, Swains Island was settled by the American Eli Hutchinson Jennings and his Samoan wife Malia. Jennings claimed ownership of the island and governed it as a semi-independent settlement.Unlocking the Secrets of Swains Island, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, September 2013. During the late 19th century, the United States and the United Kingdom made competing claims to many islands in the Pacific Ocean, including the three atolls of Tokelau, Swains Island, and several of the Ellice, Phoenix, Line and Cook Islands. Most of them were administered by the United Kingdom, starting with the British Western Pacific Territories in 1877. In 1909, the United Kingdom recognised U.S. sovereignty over Swains Island after a tax dispute. In 1925 the United States formally annexed Swains Island, administering it as part of American Samoa. The United Kingdom transferred the administration of the Cook Islands and Tokelau to New Zealand, in 1901 and 1926. In 1977, the United States and New Zealand established exclusive economic zones, which partially overlapped around their territories of American Samoa, Cook Islands and Tokelau. In addition, Tuvalu and Kiribati, which contained the other disputed islands, became independent in 1978 and 1979. In this context, the United States sought to sign treaties to resolve the maritime boundaries and formally abandon its claims to the islands, establishing friendly relations with the new nations or autonomous territories. Such treaties included the Treaty of Tarawa and the Cook Islands‚ÄìUnited States Maritime Boundary Treaty.Pacific Island Treaties: Hearing Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, 1 December 1981. The last treaty in this series was with Tokelau. In this case, while resolving the maritime boundary and abandoning its claims to the three atolls of Tokelau, the United States also sought to obtain recognition of U.S. sovereignty over Swains Island from the people of Tokelau, who claimed the island as part of their archipelago.Tokelau and Swains Island, Pacific Islands Report, 16 July 2002. Although New Zealand handled international relations on behalf of Tokelau, the New Zealand government consulted extensively with Tokelauan leaders during the negotiations, allowed them to make their own decision on the subject, and authorised them to sign the treaty themselves.Tokelauans told their claim on U.S. territory of Swains Island is weak, Pacific Islands Report, 5 July 2002. The United States sent ambassador Anne Clark Martindell to Atafu to sign the treaty with them, and the event became more dramatic when the ambassador's boat almost capsized when going over the reef to reach the atoll. Terms The treaty was signed on 2 December 1980. It specifies a maritime boundary of seven geodetic line segments defined by eight individual coordinate points, located between Swains Island and the three atolls of Tokelau. The treaty also specifies that each country shall not claim sovereignty over the waters on each other's side of the boundary, and it explicitly confirms that the United States recognises the sovereignty of Tokelauans, exercised by New Zealand, over the three atolls.Treaty on the delimitation of the maritime boundary between Tokelau and the United States of America (with map), United Nations Treaty Series, 1998. Although the text of the treaty does not explicitly mention Swains Island, it states in the preamble that New Zealand had not claimed as part of Tokelau any island administered as part of American Samoa. The location of the maritime boundary and the map attached to the treaty also imply recognition of U.S. sovereignty over Swains Island. Aftermath The treaty was ratified by both parties and came into force on 3 September 1983. Years later, some Tokelauans began to express their regret over the loss of Swains Island, or Olohega in Tokelauan. In 2002, the lead singer of the New Zealand music group Te Vaka, Opetaia Foa‚Äòi, who is a descendant of Tokelauans, wrote song \\"HƒÅloa Olohega\\" () about it.Popular music group demanding U.S. return remote Swains Island to Tokelau, Pacific Islands Report, 4 July 2002.HƒÅloa Olohega, Te Vaka. The popular song sparked a heated debate about the subject, including allegations that the leaders had been tricked into signing the treaty.Letter to the editor, Pacific Islands Report, 21 July 2002. The New Zealand and U.S. governments strongly denied these allegations, pointing to the extensive consultation with the Tokelauan leaders during the negotiations. In preparation for a self-determination referendum in 2006, the government of Tokelau wrote a draft constitution, whose preamble lists Olohega as one of the four \\"historic islands\\" of Tokelau.Constitution of Tokelau, Government of Tokelau. The government clarified that this mention was symbolic and confirmed that the island was legally part of American Samoa, and that any change to this situation could only be done by agreement with the United States, which was unlikely.Summary of the Constitution of Tokelau, Government of Tokelau. \\"Olohega is mentioned in the Preamble as part of the historical and cultural story of Tokelau. The exercise of self-determination by Tokelau has no effect on the status of Olohega. Olohega is part of the USA (Treaty of Tokehega). That situation is unlikely to change. It could not change except with the agreement of the USA. The owners of Olohega are those identified as the owners by the law of American Samoa. The rights of the owners in respect of land use are governed by the law of American Samoa.\\" The referendum was supported by most voters but failed to reach the required two-thirds majority. Despite the clarification by the government and the failed referendum, the claim over Olohega became a prominent subject. In 2007 the parliament of Tokelau proposed a flag containing four stars, roughly positioned according to the locations of the four atolls, including Olohega. Another self-determination referendum was held that year with more eligible voters and more support, but still fell short of the two-thirds requirement. In 2008, the proposed flag was modified, in a compromise still including four stars but arranged in the shape of the Southern Cross. This modified proposal was officially adopted in 2009. In 2011, Tokelauan singer Vaniah Toloa, son of the then Head of Government of Tokelau Foua Toloa, wrote the song \\"Tokelau Ke Manuia\\" (), which fondly mentions Olohega along with the three atolls of Tokelau.Wayfinding in Pacific linguascapes: Negotiating Tokelau linguistic indentities in Hawai‚Äòi, Akiemi Glenn, August 2012.Tokelau Ke Manuia, Musixmatch.Tokelau Ke Manuia, Youtube.

The street is long, beginning at an intersection with Trumbull Street in Elizabeth, continuing on a west-east alignment to the intersection with North Avenue at New Jersey Route 81. The street was formerly known as Humboldt Avenue by the city of Elizabeth and formerly maintained by the New Jersey State Highway Department (now the New Jersey Department of Transportation) as an alignment of Route 164. Route 164 was first assigned onto Humboldt Avenue after the 1953 state highway renumbering, continuing until somewhere between 1957 and 1969, when it was decommissioned and turned over to the city for maintenance. Later on, Humboldt Avenue was changed names to Dowd Avenue, and the alignment was used as a frontage road to the recently constructed Route 81 Expressway.  Route description  Dowd Avenue heading under a state-maintained bridge in Elizabeth Dowd Avenue begins at an intersection with Trumbull Street and New Point Road in the city of Elizabeth, New Jersey. The street heads northward, crossing between two railroad lines and passing under two overpasses serving former rail lines. Paralleling to the east of the New Jersey Turnpike, Dowd Avenue crosses under another railroad, the route enters a short community in the southeastern portion of Elizabeth. The highway then continues northward, intersecting with Schiller Street, which serves as the main street. After leaving the community, Dowd Avenue turns to the northwest, crossing under the twelve lanes of the turnpike just south of Interchange 13A and continuing northward on a western parallel. From here, Dowd Avenue continues northward along the turnpike right-of-way, passing through a large industrial community, serving several industries (including Wakefern Food Corporation). A two-lane roadway, Dowd Avenue intersects with Evans Street, which dead-ends soon after. Entering the center of Elizabeth and along a parallel with Route 81, Dowd Avenue continues northward until reaching North Avenue, which serves as the northern terminus of Dowd combined with the Route 81 interchange. Dowd Avenue's right-of-way merges into Route 81. Dowd Avenue heading southbound through Elizabeth's industrial district  History  The alignment of Dowd Avenue originates as the name of Humboldt Avenue and the designation of New Jersey Route 164. Route 164 was first designated just after the 1953 state highway renumbering, as the highway was not listed as a creation of the renumbering from its original system. Although the maps produced by Rand McNally never showed Route 164 after 1955, the highway was in logs produced by the state of New Jersey past 1957. Route 164 was decommissioned by the New Jersey State Highway Department by the 1969 milepost log. In 1982, the new freeway to Newark Airport (New Jersey Route 81), which parallels the former alignment of Route 164, opened.

It is a subsidiary company of Sterling Paper Group of Companies which was founded by Henry Lim Bon Liong in 1998. Inspired by the way China solved its food shortage and becoming a surplus exporter afterwards, Henry obtained assistance of Prof. Yuan Long Ping to develop a hybrid rice that would suit the farming conditions in the country. Its primary purpose is to promote the development, commercialization, and growth of hybrid rice technology as well as bring employment and entrepreneurship to the rural areas in the country. From its former land provided by the government of Laguna, it is now in the 40-hectare land in Barangay Oogong, Santa Cruz, Laguna, serving as its research and breeding complex. In April 2000, its first hybrid rice seeds were harvested (Mestizo A line and F1 Mestizo hybrid rice seeds). Its production led to an agreement between SLAC and the Department of Agriculture through the representation of PHILRICE. SLAC then established its first major seed production base at Banaybanay, Davao Oriental. The development of hybrid rice SL-8 in 2002 marked the business growth of SLAC. It is now the major distributor and exporter of hybrid rice throughout the country and to other countries like Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

Philosophy of film has significant overlap with film theory, a branch of film studies.  History  The earliest person to explore philosophical questions regarding film was Hugo M√ºnsterberg. During the so-called silent film era, he sought to understand what it was about film that made it conceptually distinct from theater. He concluded that the use of close-ups, flash-backs, and edits were unique to film and constituted its nature. Rudolf Arnheim, with the beginning of the era of synchronized sound for film, argued that earlier films were aesthetically superior to the \\"talkies\\". He held that by adding technologically synchronized sound to replace previous live-accompaniment of otherwise silent moving images, the unique status of film had been removed. Instead of being a unique art form that could carefully study bodies in motion, film had become merely a combination of two other art forms. Andr√© Bazin, contrary to Arnheim, held that whether or not a film has sound is largely irrelevant. He believed that film, due mainly to its foundation in and relationship with photography, had a realist aspect to it. He argued that film has the ability to capture the real world. The film Waking Life also features a discussion of the philosophy of film where the theories of Bazin are emphasized. In it, the character waxes philosophic that every moment of film is capturing an aspect of God. American philosopher No√´l Carroll has argued that the earlier characterizations of film made by philosophers too narrowly defined the nature of film and that they incorrectly conflated aspects of genres of films with film in general. Aspects of Bazin's realist theories have been accepted by philosophers in spite of Carroll's critique. The transparency thesis, which says that film is a medium transparent to true reality, has been accepted by Kendall Walton.

This is also the name of the nonprofit organization that operates the theater. The Flickinger Center put on a variety of entertainment, including concerts, plays, musicals, dance recitals, and beauty pageants, both by professional stage companies and by local amateur groups. History The nonprofit Alamogordo Civic Auditorium, Inc. was created in 1983 to provide a facility for the performing arts in Alamogordo and Otero County. In 1988 Alamogordo resident Margaret Flickinger bought the Sierra Theater, a 1950s-style movie theater, and donated it to the organization. The theater and the organization were renamed Flickinger Center for the Performing Arts. The inaugural performance at the theater was in December 1988 by the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra. The inaugural season started in October 1992. The building has undergone two major renovations. In 1990‚Äì1991 the Flickinger Center organization ran a capital campaign that raised $1 million, until then the largest fund-raising campaign ever held in Alamogordo. The movie theater was converted into a live theater by creating a by stage and adding an orchestra pit, dressing rooms, a wardrobe and orchestra room, and additional lighting. A second round of renovation was performed in 2007, after securing capital outlay grants of $1 million from the State of New Mexico. This renovation provided additional restrooms, a new sound booth, a handicapped-seating area, and an ADA-compliant ramp. At the end of the second renovation the theater had given up 90 seats and seated 590. Governance and operation In 2003 the organization transferred ownership of the building to the County of Otero, and received a lease on the property with an option to purchase. Ownership was transferred so that state funding could be used to renovate the building. The organization pays no rent, but provides services to Otero County including some performances that are free to County residents. The Flickinger Guild, founded in 1991, is a volunteer group that does most of the operating work of the Center, and does some fundraising. Programs The Flickinger Center presents a variety of entertainment, including concerts, plays, musicals, dance recitals, and beauty pageants. Shows include both professional stage productions and local amateur groups. Alamogordo Music Theater, a local amateur group, has performed most of its shows since 1989 at the Center. During the summer the Flickinger Center organization presents the Tailgate Summer Jazz Series, outdoor concerts performed in the parking lot of the New Mexico Museum of Space History. The Miss New Mexico Scholarship Pageant is held each June at the Flickinger Center; it has been held in Alamogordo since 1998.

Early life and career Chip is the son of the late Charles W. Prather, longtime chief of the University of California, Davis Fire Department from the 1950s to the 80s. Chip began his career in 1970 as a seasonal firefighter with the California Department of Forestry, now known as California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL Fire). Fire chief Prather was named the Fire Chief of the Orange County Fire Authority on October 1, 1997.http://www.ocfa.org/_uploads/pdf/sr_bd090625-04.pdf Prather's leadership can be characterized as unusually involved in the community in which he served. Prather would commonly address derision directly, often responding to blogging critics online and answering his own rookie firefighters' complaints in person (see Orange County Register article from March 31, 2006). The level of investment shown by the Chief earned the respect of the firefighters which served under his leadership, resulting in numerous accolades from state and federal agencies as well as a resolution approved by the board of Orange County Board of Directors on June 25, 2009. During his tenure as Fire Chief, Prather developed and/or expanded many instrumental safety programs including: the Paramedic Assessment Unit Program, the Urban Search and Rescue Team, Helicopter Program, Safety Officer Response Plan, the Automatic External Defibrillator Program, Swift Water Rescue Team, Technical Truck Program, WEFIT Program, and Occupant Liaison Program. These programs greatly increased the status and quality of Orange County's regional fire protection, and attracted fire departments from across the globe to emulate the OCFA's procedures (including fire departments in Japan). Fire Chief Prather sought to create a new headquarters for the fire department which he had expanded and improved, and accomplished this goal in 2004. The new Regional Fire Operations and Training Center (RFOTC) completed construction in June 2004, and moved the OCFA from its former headquarters on Water St. in the city of Orange to the northeast border of Irvine, California. The training center is one of the most advanced in the world, with a six-story tower that can be remotely set ablaze and extinguished, swiftwater rescue canals, train track and airplane fuselage for Mass Casualty Incident training, and an underground dispatch center that can flex over 18 inches in the event of earthquakes. While its construction was a complex project involving the efforts of many stakeholders, the RFOTC became a visible symbol of the Chief's success in transforming the once fledgling fire department into a world class institution. Chip Prather oversaw Orange County's Federal Emergency Management Agency Urban search and rescue Team, CAT-5, one of only eight in the state of California and 28 in the entire United States. In November 2008, Prather expanded this program by adding the first nationally certified canine and handler team in Orange County.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/training- team-search-2224784-canine-dog Safety, prevention, and education All of Chief Prather's achievements have helped Orange County's cities become some of the safest in America. The city of Irvine for example, is served by over eight OCFA fire stations, and has been ranked the number one safest city in America for four years in a row (for a population over 100,000).

It is located about 12 miles southwest of the city of Cartago. It is also known as San Juan de Tobosi. St. John the Evangelist is the town's patron guardian.  History  Tobosi is one of the oldest town in the country. It was established as a reduction by the Spanish authorities and the Franciscan friars around 1575, with a population of one hundred people. Other interpretations suggest that the town started with a hundred families. Until 1826, the population consisted exclusively of indigenous peoples (ethnic Huet), but due to its proximity to the city of Cartago, its inhabitants were frequently used as forced labor for the benefit of the Spanish population and rapidly lost their language, dress and customs. In 1568, responding to protests against the common abuses resulting from the direct enslavement of indigenous people by conquistadors, the Spanish King, Phillip II, created laws to protect the Indians and decreed such parceling out of indigenous peoples as slaves to be illegal. Instead of being owned directly by individual conquistadors, Indian villages or tribes were to pay a prescribed amount into a fund out of which an annual stipend was to be paid to each of the grantees. Nonetheless, the conquistadors protested to their Governor against this new arrangement and in January 1569 the Governor, Pero Af√°n de Ribera y G√≥mez, illegally apportioned the indigenous peoples as slaves, including those of the villages surrounding Cartago, among approximately forty Spaniards. During its period of Spanish domination, the town had its own town council or municipality, which was abolished in 1836 by the government of Braulio Carrillo Colina. Like other indigenous communities in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, the people also lost their communal lands, which were confiscated and sold at public auction.

Fassbinder directed Kaufmann in a total of 14 films, casting him in leading and minor roles. Kaufmann was also romantically involved with the director for a time. In 2002, Kaufmann was accused of murder in relation to the 2001 death of Hartmut Hagen, a 60-year-old accountant whom Kaufmann's wife had defrauded. The death was ruled accidental, but Kaufmann was sentenced to prison for lesser crimes relating to the incident. In 2005, a new police investigation discovered that Kaufmann was innocent, and had confessed to the crimes to cover up for his late wife, who may have been the perpetrator. He was subsequently released from prison and resumed his acting career. Early life G√ºnther Kaufmann was born on 16 June 1947 in Munich's Hasenbergl neighborhood. His mother was German and his father was an African-American soldier stationed in Germany after World War II. Career Not an actor by training, Kaufmann was discovered by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. His first role was in 1970, a bit part in a made-for-television production of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal, directed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff. Fassbinder played the title role. The same year, Fassbinder cast Kaufmann in his film Gods of the Plague as a character named G√ºnther. Relationship with Fassbinder Though Kaufmann was married when he met Fassbinder, the two men began a romantic relationship. Kaufmann is often described as Fassbinder's first major love interest. Like many of Fassbinder's relationships, it was troubled, and the director would often try to buy Kaufmann's affection with expensive presents, particularly cars. During their relationship, Fassbinder married Ingrid Caven, an actress who, like Kaufmann, regularly appeared in the director's films and was a member of his tightly knit circle of friends. By 1971, Fassbinder and Kaufmann had split up, and the director began an even more troubled relationship with a Moroccan immigrant, El Hedi ben Salem. Kaufmann continued to appear in Fassbinder's films, sometimes also contributing songs to the soundtracks. He appeared in Fassbinder's last movie, Querelle (1982). Later career After Fassbinder died of a drug overdose in 1982, Kaufmann played bit roles in films. In 1986, he married for a third time to Alexandra von Herrendorf, to whom he remained married until her death from cancer in 2002. In the 1990s, he began to act more frequently, appearing in recurring roles on many television shows. But around 2000, acting jobs began to dry up. His wife's cancer was getting worse, and it was to pay for her treatment that the Kaufmanns defrauded their accountant, Hartmut Hagen, of almost $500,000. Kaufmann in 2008 Death of Hartmut Hagen, conviction and exoneration In 2001, Hagen was found dead, apparently suffocated. Kaufmann and von Herrendorf had defrauded Hagen of $500,000, and Kaufmann was accused of murder. In 2002, the death was ruled accidental after Kaufmann, who weighed close to 260 pounds (118 kg) at the time of the incident, confessed that he had fallen on Hagen during a fight. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for blackmail and robbery in relation to the incident. In 2005, a police investigation revealed that Kaufmann had not committed the crimes, but had confessed in order to protect his dying wife. The investigation also revealed that Hagen was killed by three men likely hired by von Herrendorf, without his knowledge, who had broken into Hagen‚Äôs home to retrieve incriminating evidence against von Herrendorf. Kaufmann was released from prison in 2005. He then resumed his acting career, which had been waning around the time of Hagen's death, appearing in supporting roles in films and on television. Personal life Kaufmann was married four times and had two children, Eva and Davy. His son Davy (born 1969) is a rock and soul singer and reached the final of the 2009 version of Germany's Got Talent. Death  Kaufmann died on 10 May 2012 at age 64, having suffered a heart attack while out for a walk in Berlin's Grunewald area. A passer-by and paramedics tried to resuscitate him on site for two hours.

The ruin stands on Big ≈Ωrnovec Hill (), near the village of Hudi Konec. History In 1161, Count Otto II of Ortenburg erected a small fort at the site. By the early 15th century the castle was inherited by the Counts of Celje; in the late 15th century it passed from the Habsburgs to the house of Lamberg. Peasant revolts and Ottoman raids damaged the castle, necessitating a thorough Renaissance rebuilding. Sold off in the late 16th century, it lost most of its importance. Another remodeling followed in the 17th century, by the Counts Mosconi; the castle chapel of St. George dates from this phase. Its final owners were the Kosler family; The castle was acquired in 1823 by Johann Kosler Sr. (1780‚Äì1864),Kosler family, 1841‚Äì1942 the father of Peter Kosler. Johann Kosler Jr. (1819‚Äì1898) and his family moved from the castle to the more convenient Lower Ortnek Castle on the road from Ljubljana to Koƒçevje in 1884. The last owner of the castle was Oskar Kosler (1898‚Äì1959), who lost the property when it was nationalized by Slovenia's postwar communist government in 1946.Vilhar, ƒårtomir. 1991. \\"Kozler.\\" Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 5, p. 354.

Jones was a major contributor to the discography and commercial success of the Outlaws. Hughie Thomasson invited him to join the Outlaws after seeing him perform. Jones grew up in Tampa, FL but lived for a long time in Boulder, Colorado. While in high school he was a track star holding the record in the 440-yard dash. A very talented musician, he played drums, keyboards and guitar. He was offered a scholarship to Juilliard School of Music but turned it down, electing to attend the University of South Florida. He was a math major and graduated near the top of his class. He taught and tutored math for a while and contemplated teaching full time, but music was Jones's calling. He recorded one album with a band called H.Y. Sledge before joining Outlaws. He was initially brought on as a keyboardist but soon switched to lead guitar, helping crystallize the trademark Outlaws sound. After touring the Outlaws hit album Ghost Riders, he was asked to leave the band for substance abuse. In February 1995, Jones died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

The AF system is a new design which uses a translucent LCD display in the viewfinder. The camera uses TTL 63 zone color sensitive metering system with four variations (evaluative, center-weighted, partial, spot) and exposure compensation of ‚àí5 EV to +5 EV in steps of 1/3 EV (¬±3 EV visible in the viewfinder and top screen, ¬±5 EV visible on the back screen). E-TTL II flash metering is provided. The translucent LCD can also display guide lines and the spot metering area circle. As with most other video-capable DSLRs, the Canon EOS 7D's autofocusing function does not work while recording video. Instead, users can only trigger a contrast-detect AF cycle before recording process by hitting the AF button on the camera's rear panel. Users can manually focus the lens during a recording. Shutter The shutter is rated to 150,000 shots, and is capable of speeds up to 1/8000 sec, with a flash sync speed of 1/250 sec. Ergonomics The 7D has roughly the same dimension as the older 5D Mark II with an updated button layout. It also features a 100% viewfinder with 1x magnification. The 7D was the first Canon camera with a dedicated movie mode switch, instead of movie recording being done in live view as with the 5D Mark II and 500D. Speed Rear view. The 7D has dual DIGIC 4 processors and can reach 8 frames per second continuous shooting. When the camera was first released, the buffer throughput allowed up to 94 frames in large fine JPEG mode, and up to 15 frames in raw. Firmware upgrades, most recently in August 2012 (see immediately below), have increased the maximum buffer size to 130 large fine JPEGs and 25 raw files.

Video The Canon EOS 7D offers the ability to record audio from an external source. Both shutter and aperture are available for manual control, and the 7D also provides multiple frame rate options, including three that match the HD television timing specs. Like most DSLR modes, the Canon 7D neglects endless autofocus during video recording, which is a great concern for advanced amateurs with pros likely to focus manually nonetheless. Separate movie clips that are captured by the Canon EOS 7D are limited to twelve minutes in the high definition 1080p and 720p modes, or 24 minutes in the standard definition VGA mode, depending on what Compact Flash Card is being used. Larger memory cards make for longer video lengths and are available in multiple sizes for the camera. Independent filmmakers often use the Canon 7D as an affordable alternative to digital cinema cameras. The camera was used on the feature films Stanley Ka Dabba, Vazhakku Enn 18/9, and The Avengers. They have also been used on television in the opening title sequence of the 2009 season of Saturday Night Live.

Early life  Miriam Eliot O'Brien was born in Forest Glen, Maryland on July 22, 1898. Her father was a newspaper editor and government official, and her mother was a physician. With her parents, she first visited the Alps in 1914, and completed an introductory climb near Chamonix. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Bryn Mawr College in 1920, and a master's degree in psychology from the same university in 1921. She visited the Alps during several summers after World War I, and dabbled with mountaineering. She studied physics at Johns Hopkins University from 1923 to 1925.Ware, Susan and Braukman, Stacy (editors), Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5, essay by Brown, Rebecca A. pages 649-650 (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005) She was an active member of the Appalachian Mountain Club her entire adult life.  Mountaineering  Miriam O'Brien began serious rock climbing in the Alps in May 1926, completing a first ascent on Torre Grande in the Dolomites by a route now known as the \\"Via Miriam\\" in her honor. She also completed the first ascent of the Aiguille de Roc near Mont Blanc. On August 4, 1928 O'Brien, accompanied by Robert L. M. Underhill and guides Armand Charlet and G. Cachat, completed the first ascent of the traverse from the Aiguilles du Diable to Mont Blanc du Tacul in the Alps.Milner, C. Douglas, Mont Blanc & the Aguilles, page 92 (Robert Hale Limited, London, 1955) This route involves \\"climbing five outstanding summits over 4000 meters in superb surroundings.\\" R√©buffat, Gaston, The Mont Blanc Massif: The 100 Finest Routes, Translated from the French by Jane and Colin Taylor, page 140 (Kaye & Ward, London and Oxford University Press, New York, 1974) In 1929, she completed a climb of the Aiguille du Gr√©pon with French climber Alice Damesme. This achievement by two women led mountaineer √âtienne Bruhl to complain \\"The Gr√©pon has disappeared. Now that it has been done by two women alone, no self-respecting man can undertake it. A pity, too, because it used to be a very good climb\\".Loomis, Molly, American Alpine Journal, 2005, page 99 On September 3, 1930, she climbed the most difficult route on the Finsteraarhorn, the north-east face, with guides A. and F. Rubi. This peak is the highest in the Bernese Alps. Her climb was the third ascent, and the route had only been climbed twice in the preceding 24 years. In 1931, she climbed the M√∂nch and the Jungfrau in the Bernese Alps with Micheline Morin. In 1932, she completed the first all- women's ascent of the Matterhorn with Alice Damesme. She married mountaineer and Harvard professor Robert L. M. Underhill in 1932. They had two sons, born in 1936 and 1939. After World War II, she climbed with her husband in the Wind River Range of Wyoming, the Mission, Swan and Beartooth ranges of Montana, and the Sawtooth range of Idaho. She climbed the Matterhorn for her third and final time in 1952. She, along with her husband, were charter members of the Four Thousand Footer Club, a section of the Appalachian Mountain Club. The only membership requirement was climbing all 48 four thousand foot peaks of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. They were the first to climb all of those peaks during the winter, completing the quest with their ascent of Mount Jefferson on December 31, 1960. At that time the list consisted of just 46 peaks.Ware, Susan and Braukman, Stacy (editors), Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5, essay by Brown, Rebecca A. page 650 (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005)  Writer and editor  She wrote an essay titled Manless Alpine Climbing: The First Woman to Scale the Gr√©pon, the Matterhorn and Other Famous Peaks Without Masculine Support, which was published by the National Geographic Society in 1934. antiQbook: Manless Alpine Climbing - retrieved September 1, 2009 This essay, or excerpts from it, has been republished in several compendia of mountaineering literature.Da Silva, Rachel, Leading Out: Women Climbers Reaching for the Top (Seal Press, Berkeley, 1992) In this essay, she explained her mountaineering philosophy this way: \\"Very early, I realized that the person who invariably climbs behind a good leader...may never really learn mountaineering at all and in any case enjoys only part of the varied delights and rewards of climbing.\\" She went on to say, \\"I did realize that if women were really to lead, that is, to take the entire responsibility for the climb, there couldn't be any man at all in the party.\\" Her autobiography, Give Me the Hills, was published in London by Methuen Publishing in 1956.

Ca. 1640. Boedapest, Sz√©pmuv√©szeti M√∫zeum. Pieter de Molijn (6 April 1595 in London - 23 March 1661 in Haarlem) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver born in England. He was baptized in the Dutch Reformed Austin Friars church in London. Little is known of his early training, but he probably traveled to Italy and in 1616 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. He was a contemporary of Jacob Pinas.Pieter Molyn biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He married Geertuyt Huygen de Bie. During the years 1616-27 he lived in Delft where he remarried after his first wife died. In the marriage notice, his wife Geertruyt de Roovere is from Amsterdam and he is from Delft. De Molijn was possibly a student of Esaias van de Velde. He taught several students, including Gerard ter Borch the Elder & his son, Jan Coelenbier, Allart van Everdingen, Christian de Hulst, Anthony Molijn, Jan Nose and Jan Wils.Pieter de Molijn in the RKD De Molijn was known for his landscapes, but he also made genre pieces, marine scenes, portraits, and architectural pieces. This type of oeuvre is typical for the Italian-bound artists of his day, who paid their way as a jack-of-all-trades.

Molyn biography in De groote schouburgh He was thought to be a man of 50 by Isaac de Moucheron when he was in Rome (Bent name Ordenantie) in 1697. He specialized in wilde zwynenjagten, or hunting scenes, in the manner of Frans Snyders. In Genoa he was imprisoned for 16 years for killing his wife. He was visited in prison by Jan Visser, a painter from the Bentvueghels known as Slempop. When the French bombarded the city in 1684, he was set free and fled to Parma, where he lived to old age, painting with two eyeglasses, one in front of the other. According to the art historian Marcel Roethlisberger, the nickname Pietro Tempesta was given to another Haarlemmer, the painter Pieter Mulier II, who was given the name for painting ships in stormy seas.

It was then taken over by the Dutch in 1640. The Dutch improved and modified the buildings inside with Dutch architecture. In 1988, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) listed Galle Fort as a World Heritage Site. In 1999 the Sri Lankan government lifted the 100% tax on foreign ownership, which resulted in Australian, Karl Steinberg, and his Malaysian partner Christopher Ong purchasing a dilapidated 17th century Dutch merchant's house in Galle Fort. They spent two years renovating the house, which is the biggest in Galle, according to traditional building techniques and using local craftsmen. In 2007 it was awarded the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards of Distinction, for heritage conservation. The citation included the following: > This carefully considered transformation of an abandoned historic > residential compound into a stylish luxury boutique hotel has evocatively > captured the spirit of place of the colonial World Heritage fortified town > of Galle.

Biography Her father was an entrepreneur of Basque ancestry who made a fortune during a trip to Cuba and married the daughter of a vineyard owner when he returned. That vineyard, Le Ch√¢teau de Clauzel, is still in business. She was in poor health as a girl and had to spend many hours in bed, during which she began to draw. After her sisters were all married, she wanted to study art. Her parents decided to sell their interest in the vineyard and moved to Paris with her in 1888. She enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian; studying with William Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. In 1895, she exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais and was awarded a prize for her painting, L'Amour de l'Art. As a result, she began to receive orders for advertising posters, beginning with one for the Bal des Increvables at the Casino de Paris, followed by one to announce the launching of La Fronde, a journal founded by Marguerite Durand in 1897. The following year, she became a member of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais and obtained a scholarship to study in Spain. By 1905, she was a well-established artist; working with Edmond Rostand and decorating his \\"\\" in Cambo-les-Bains. Her mother's sudden death plunged her into solitude and she developed what she herself described as a mad passion for Edmond's youngest son Maurice, who was still a teenager and openly homosexual. This tormented relationship lasted for several years. Later career Her career continued to expand. She received a commission from the government for decorations at new additions to the Sorbonne and portraits of numerous personalities. In 1911, she built a villa in Basque Country, but had to sell it in 1926 when her financial situation began to deteriorate. She set up a studio in Antibes, facing the sea. It was later occupied by other artists; notably Nicolas de Sta√´l and the sculptor, , both of whom died there. She became an adept of Ren√© Gu√©non and a passionate admirer of the young Krishnamurti. In 1932, she wrote Les Trois Couleurs de la Lumi√®re, in which she expounded her esoteric vision of art. In addition to Gu√©non, she was inspired by the theories of the aesthetician, Charles Henry, and the gnostic, Paul-Fran√ßois-Gaspard Lacuria (1806-1890), author of The Harmonies of Being. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. She was finally forced to leave Antibes and rent her workshop. She returned to Paris and exhibited at the Salon of the . In 1937, she died of stomach cancer and was buried at the Cimeti√®re parisien de Thiais, in the section for indigents.

Rose House is located on Tomkins Avenue in Stony Point, New York, United States. It is an ornate Carpenter Gothic-style house from the mid-19th century, with similar outbuildings, built for a wealthy local businessman. In order to preserve it during the construction of a nearby senior citizens' home during the late 20th century, it was moved from its original site a short distance away and rotated. In 1999 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The house is located on an lot a short distance east of North Liberty Drive (US 9W/202), at the corner of Tomkins and Roosevelt Place. The ground in the area slopes gently towards the Hudson River to the east. The neighborhood is residential. A senior citizens' apartment complex, called Knight's Corners, is just to the north. It is a two- and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay balloon frame house on a concrete foundation topped by a steeply-pitched cross-gabled roof shingled in slate, pierced by two brick chimneys at the sides. The south (front) facade has a porch across the entire first story, with a projecting bay window with scroll- sawn vergeboard above it on the second story. The gable above it has a central arched window, with elaborate vergeboards and finials. A paneled frieze and bracketed cornice adorn the roofline. The two side elevations are identical, with a projecting bay window on the southernmost bay of the first story. The north (rear) elevation also matches the front facade, with the exception of an enclosure on the western third of the porch. Inside, the original layout is almost intact. Much of the original trim remains, including the marble fireplace mantel in each room. One of the fireplaces has a coal stove attached. Many of the original light fixtures remain, hanging from plaster medallions in the ceilings. In back is a carriage house with lines similar to the main building. Its cross-gables have a similar Gothic-arched window, and the roof is topped by a square cupola. Next to it is an unadorned outhouse original to the property. Both are considered contributing resources to the property's historic character. History The land on which the house stands was originally part of a large tract purchased by Resolvert Waldron in 1751. Very little of the land around Stony Point was arable, and in the early 19th century brickmaking arose as the dominant industry, due to the abundant clay underground near the Hudson. Samuel Brewster, a wealthy iron mine owner and descendant of William Brewster, bought the portion inherited by John Waldron, whose farmhouse was on the Rose House's original site. Brewster bequeathed it to his grandson Richard and his wife Rachel when he died in 1821. Maps and other records from the mid-19th century show the location of the Waldron House and suggest that the Brewsters did not live there, but rather at a house now in the center of town, at what is now the northwest corner of Routes 9W/202 and Main Street. The same records suggest the Waldron House was demolished by a Paul Rose in 1862 to clear the way for a new house. It is possible that the house may have been a speculative venture by the Brewsters, since the market for housing near the river was strong at the time. The design, by an unknown architect, shows the strong posthumous influence of the philosophies of Andrew Jackson Downing and the cottage-type houses he promoted. The decorative vergeboards and steep cross-gabled are common elements in this type of early Gothic Revival house, often called Carpenter Gothic today. When built, it originally occupied a lot across the street from its present location, and faced north rather than south. Rose, a local brickmaker who left that business to make carriages in New York City, probably bought the home to commute to his business in the city, from which he moved his residence sometime before the Civil War. He bought the house for $5,300 ($ in contemporary dollars), apparently without needing to take out a mortgage. In 1875, he is listed as the owner for the first time. Two years later, he sold it to Minoff Govan, a local physician, while holding the mortgage himself, and bought it back in 1882. The Govans continued to live there, until daughter Edith sold it a Ruth Martz for $1. She held onto the home until 1985, when she was herself living in a New Jersey nursing home. The Housing Development Fund Company, which bought it from her, sold it a month later to a William Helmer. When the Roosevelt House was built, a strong community effort was mounted to preserve the Rose House. Those led to it being sold to Roy Moskoff, once again for $1, on the condition that the house and outbuildings be moved across the street and rotated. This was done and the house remains a private residence.

The incumbent mayor, Sophie Masloff of the Democratic Party chose to run for her first full term after having ascended the mayor's office from the position of President of City Council upon the death of long-time mayor Richard Caliguiri. While she met challengers in the Democratic primary (which she won), she was uncontested in the general election. Democratic Primary Masloff, a 71-year-old self-described \\"Jewish grandmother\\" had been involved with city politics for nearly half a century. However, after taking the position of mayor, her leadership abilities came under scrutiny; critics asserted that Caliguiri's aides were running the city, while Masloff was only a figurehead. With Masloff appearing vulnerable, a variety of top tier Democrats jumped at the chance to unseat her in the primary--the real contest in this heavily Democratic city. No Republican filed to run, so for all intents and purposes whoever won the Democratic primary would be the next mayor., Allegheny County Controller Frank Lucchino, who ran on a campaign emphasizing fiscal prudence, appeared to be the frontrunner in the race, and for many weeks leading up to the election, polled just a few points ahead of Masloff. Tom Murphy, a State Representative (who would become mayor in 1993), also proved to be a viable contender, as he emphasized how his economic knowledge could guide the city toward a more diversified economy. Two other candidates with strong appeal to particular groups complicated the race: Tom Flaherty (who is unrelated to former Mayor Pete Flaherty), the City Controller, had strong support from the city's police and fire unions, while attorney and longtime civil rights activist Byrd Brown had a base in the black community. Masloff, who made many personal appearances and charmed voters with her colorful personality, took the lead in polling in the closing days and went on to take the nomination. Murphy, who characterized himself as a \\"high tech visionary,\\" also found momentum late, as he finished in second and set himself up to be a future force in city politics; Lucchino's campaign faded as he continued to question Masloff's credentials..

The majority of the present structure dates from its Renaissance and Baroque rebuildings, and the southeast wing was added in the 19th century. The layout of the castle's Baroque garden remains, although the grounds are now occupied by a vegetable garden. The 140 m avenue leading to the manor is bordered with mature chestnuts. Before the Second World War, the manor served as a women's penitentiary, operated by the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul. In 1940, a pavilion was built in the park according to a concept by the Slovenian architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. During World War II the manor became a Gestapo prison, through which more than 11,500 prisoners passed; the grounds contain a mass grave holding the majority of the 849 detainees murdered there. Part of the manor building houses a Hostage Museum chronicling these events; the rest of it houses a psychiatric hospital.

Founded as a logging company in 1890 by Sol Simpson, the company now functions as a holding company for the Simpson Door Company, a manufacturer of wood doors. Simpson announced in 2008 that it will be entering the \\"green power\\" industry by building a new power plant at its Tacoma Tideflats mill that will generate power via the burning of sawmill and other forest waste. In August 2009, construction of the power plant was completed. It generates 55 megawatts of power which is sold to Iberdrola Renovables and used by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. The company is owned by the Reed family. William G. Reed Jr is a chairman on the board. Former divisions A picture taken in the 1940s of the Vance Creek Bridge with a Simpson train. A Simpson EMD SW1200 in 2011. The company was split into two units in 2006. The Green Diamond Resource Company is a spinoff that was created to manage Simpson's forest lands. Both companies are owned by the same shareholders and as with the current subsidiaries, function as separate departments within a large company rather than as completely independent companies. The Simpson Lumber Company conducted logging operations and was based in Shelton, Washington. Four mills were sold to Interfor and the Shelton property was sold to Sierra Pacific Industries.Interfor purchases four U.S. sawmills The \\"Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company\\" produced pulpwood and linerboard products. Previously owned by St. Regis the mill was acquired by Simpson in 1985 and sold to RockTenn Railroad The Simpson Company built and operated a logging railroad known as the Simpson Railroad. When it closed in July of 2015 it was the last logging railroad operations in the continental United and dates back 120 years. The railroad was once extensive and branched out into several hundred miles of forestland in the Olympic Peninsula but at the end was limited to just ten miles of operational track. The rail line was to transport lumber and as a transportation network to remote logging camps and towns. Construction of the railroad line was an engineering feat as demonstrated by the large and complex bridges built to span gorges and the mountainous terrain the railroad traveled through. The Vance Creek Bridge and the High Steel Bridge were built in 1929 and used until 1985 when the line was abandoned. The Vance Creek Bridge still stands, and the High Steel Bridge is still in use as a forest road. The High Steel Bridge is one of the tallest rail bridges in the United States and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In January of 2019, Green Diamond Resources leased the railroad‚Äôs remaining 10 miles, plus sidings, to the Peninsular Railway and Lumbermen‚Äôs Museum, a locally based 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The all- volunteer group is advancing plans to operate several Simpson locomotives and other rolling stock for tourist trains designed to highlight the significant roll lumbering and the railroad played in developing the economies of the local area, the Olympic Peninsula, and the entire Pacific Northwest.

Taylor was not available for the next round of the FA Cup, where Southampton were defeated by Reading, but appeared in all the matches in the Hampshire Senior Cup when the Saints lost 1‚Äì0 to the Royal Engineers in the final. In 1894, Southampton St Mary's were one of the nine founder members of the Southern League, which had been created to enable clubs in southern England who were not admitted to the Football League, to play competitive football on a regular basis. For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including Baker, Littlehales and Thomson from Stoke and Fred Hollands from Millwall Athletic. Despite this influx of professional players, Taylor's skill enabled him \\"to hold his own with the best of the professionals\\". Taylor was described at the time as being \\"a versatile player with ample resource and a great variety of methods: he plays a defensive as well as offensive game with equal success\\". He featured in Southampton's inaugural Southern League match, playing at left- back in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Chatham at the Antelope Ground on 6 October 1894. He went on to play in eleven of the sixteen league matches, generally at right-back as Southampton finished third at the end of the inaugural Southern League season. In the FA Cup, Saints reached the First Round proper for the first time, where they were drawn against Nottingham Forest, going down 4‚Äì1 to the Football League First Division side. In the 1895‚Äì96 season, Taylor's work commitments restricted him to eight league and two FA Cup appearances, usually being replaced by either Joe Dale or Joe Rogers, before losing his place to new signing William McMillan in March 1896. Taylor continued to play amateur football with Southampton's local rivals Freemantle after leaving the Saints. Later career Taylor was actively involved with many other sporting bodies, including playing cricket for the Deanery club and golf at the Stoneham Golf Club, where he was a committee member. He was also active with the Hampshire Rugby Union. He was later employed by White Star Line, where he was one of the founders of the annual football match to raise funds for the Seamen's Orphanage. At White Star Line, he was appointed Chief Cashier in 1922, a post he continued to hold until 1934 when he retired, shortly after White Star Line's merger with Cunard.

Growing from Boorganna Nature Reserve north west of Taree, New South Wales to Kin Kin in Southern Queensland. Common names include White Apple, Plumwood, and New South Wales Walnut. Endiandra virens is an understorey rainforest tree. The habitat is various types of rainforest, usually on the poorer soils at low altitude.  Description  Endiandra virens is a small tree with bright green leaves and large fruit. Usually seven to ten metres tall with a trunk diameter of 20 cm. The bark is pale, often grey or whitish grey. The bark is not smooth, with vertical ridges, lines and bumps, somewhat soft and corky. New branchlets green and smooth, new shoots with small hairs.  Leaves  The leaves are alternate, not toothed. 6 to 15 cm long, 2 to 3 cm wide. Oblong or lanceolate in shape. Leaves are narrow at both ends. Leaf stem 3 to 12 mm long. Glossy green above, duller below. The specific name virens refers to bright green of the new leaves. The midrib, lateral veins and net veins are visible on both surfaces, raised and more evident under the leaf. Midrib raised under the leaf, somewhat depressed on the upper leaf surface.  Flowers and Fruit  Small cream flowers occur on panicles in the months of March to May. The panicle is shorter than a leaf. The fruit matures from April to July, though sometimes as late as November. A very large globular drupe, 4 to 10 cm in diameter. Coloured yellow, orange or red when mature. The single seed is 3 to 4 cm in diameter. Removal of the fleshy aril is advised before planting the seeds. Endiandra virens - bark  Taxonomy  It is possible that the Queensland populations currently included as Endiandra virens between Caboolture and Kin Kin represent a distinct species once named Endiandra lowiana by F. M. Bailey in 1892. These plants differ in leaf and bark characters from the NSW populations and are similar to a less hairy Endiandra pubens while NSW plants are quite dissimilar to E. pubens. The type specimen of Endiandra lowiana is from Maroochie (Yandina), While the type for Endiandra virens is from the Clarence River see (APNI) thus should the QLD populations prove to be a distinct species they would be called Endiandra lowiana while NSW populations would retain the name Endiandra virens genetic and more detailed morphological studies would help to clarify the status of these two taxa.

Retrieved 13 November 2017. From 1899 to 1936 Marchant was a church and cathedral organist, working successively at Kemsing Parish Church, Kent; Christ Church, Newgate Street, London (from 1903), and St Peter's, Eaton Square ( from 1913). In 1903 he was appointed sub-organist at St Paul's Cathedral,\\"News in Brief\\", The Times, 28 March 1916, p. 5 and in 1927 he was made organist in succession to Charles Macpherson. At that time the building was partially closed for restoration. Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians records that Marchant conducted the reopening ceremony in June 1930 and the thanksgiving service for the silver jubilee of King George V in 1935, composing for each occasion a Te Deum. During his career as an organist he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1902, and took a Doctorate of Music at Oxford in 1914. In 1914 Marchant was appointed a professor at the RAM. He became warden there in 1934 and principal in 1936, at which point he resigned his post at St Paul's. In addition to his RAM duties he was appointed professor of music at London University in 1937). The Times said of his tenure at the RAM that he \\"breathed a new atmosphere into the conduct of affairs ... so that technical proficiency and a liberal outlook were happily combined\\". Marchant was appointed CVO in 1935 and knighted in 1943. In 1946 he was elected an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford. From 1947 he was chairman of the council of the Royal School of Church Music. He also chaired consultative panels for the Arts Council and the BBC. As a composer, Marchant produced mainly church music, including anthems, canticles and other liturgical music, but he also composed secular works for chorus, organ and solo voice. Grove says of Marchant's music: \\"the finest ... inspired by ceremonial occasions at St Paul's, is well crafted, though conservative in idiom, and shows the influence of Stanford and Parry.\\" The choir library at St Paul's holds his complete choral works. Marchant married Hilda Constance Holyman; they had a son and a daughter. Marchant died in London, while still in post as principal of the RAM, at the age of 65.

He never failed in his respect to the Nizam or presumed to act without first consulting his pleasure. Indeed, he sought to obtain his sanction for his every act in public life. The locality Musheerabad is named after him. His tomb is a heritage site in danger. Hostage of the Marathas In the Battle of Kharda, which took place on 11 March 1795, Nizam being defeated by the Marathas, he was obliged to make a disastrous peace. He was forced to cede territories including Daulatabad, yielding an annual income of 15 lacs, and he pledged himself to liquidate the whole of the Maratha's claim amounting to 30 million rupees. The prime minister was also given in hostage to the Marathas and was detained in Poona until June 1797, when he succeeded in getting the treaty cancelled. The sudden termination of Arastu Jah's administration by captivity at the Maratha court deprived his Highness's government of the service of an able minister. The situation of the affairs until his return from captivity was very critical. Raja Shan Rai Rayan was discharged from the duties of minister in the presence of Nizam Ali Khan from the time Arastu Jah went to Poona until his return to Hyderabad in July 1797. Nawab Arastu Jah, during his captivity in Poona, obtained much influence with the Marathas, so that before his return and reappointment as a minister, which took place in July 1797, he obtained the restoration of the territories ceded by the Nizam after the Battle of Kharda, the abandonment of claims from Chauth on Bida, the recession of the fort of Daulatabad and the extension of all the pecuniary claims on the part of the Maratha. One of the first acts of Arastu Jah on his return to Hyderabad and reinstatement in the ministry was to induce the Nizam to allow prince Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III to sign all public documents and sanads.

Early days The station was assigned the license by the Federal Communications Commission on July 7, 1947. WISL began regular broadcast operations in January 1948 with studios at Rock and Sunbury Streets in downtown Shamokin. WISL was originally owned by Radio Anthracite, Inc., with Henry W. Lark serving as company president. The company name reflected the coal mining heritage of the Shamokin area. The call letters were for the owner's wife, Isobel S. Lark. This ownership would persist into the 1980s. In September 1997, Laurel Broadcasting Company, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station and its FM sister station to MJR Media, Inc., (Charles Michael Hagerty, president). The combo sold for a combined sale price of $400,000.

Synopsis The Animals Film presents a survey of the uses of animals in factory farming, as pets, for entertainment, in scientific and military research, hunting, etc. The film also profiles the international animal rights movement. The film incorporates secret government footage, cartoons, newsreels, and excerpts from propaganda films. Release The Animals Film was distributed in cinemas in Britain, Australia, Germany, Austria, Canada and the United States, and was broadcast on numerous television networks. The British network, Channel Four, transmitted the film during the Channel's third night on air in November 1982. It generated front page news in Britain at the time because Channel 4 broadcast a two-hour version of the film shorn of seven minutes of its concluding sequence. The original 136 minute film released in cinemas had been approved with no cuts by the British Board of Film Censors, but the Independent Broadcasting Authority instructed Channel 4 that certain scenes in the film could 'incite crime or lead to civil disorder.'British Film Institute, The Animals Film booklet, 2008, p. 8-9 Jonathon Porritt and David Winner write that, with over one million viewers, the screening is regarded as \\"an important moment in the growth of public awareness of animal exploitation.\\"Porritt and Winner 1988, cited in Garner, Robert. Animals, Politics, and Morality. Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 80. Channel Four screened it again during its Banned series in 1991. Reception Alan Brien, film critic of the UK Sunday Times, wrote of the film: \\"The most impressive film maudit, possibly too hot to handle... stuffed with footage never before shown, and a wealth of newly-shot material often taken undercover, which documents... mankind's degradation, exploitation, and often pointless torture, of the creatures who share our planet. ...Proves, beyond contradiction, that this behaviour is not just random or personal but part of our organised society, with drug companies, government departments, scientists, military authorities, factory farmers, university research laboratories, for their own selfish ends, for profit in money or prestige. I do not know when I have come out of a screening so moved by the power of the cinema as a medium to transform the entire sensibility of an audience.\\"British Film Institute, The Animals Film booklet, 2008, p. 22 British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the film. Soundtrack Robert Wyatt composed an original soundtrack for the film, released in 1982 on Rough Trade Records. The film also features music from Talking Heads and ex-Audience frontman, Howard Werth. Critical reception of the soundtrack was mixed. Ted Mills of album database Allmusic described the soundtrack as \\"moody\\" and filled with \\"tasty- sounding analog synths from the late '70s\\", but ultimately it \\"disappoint[s] fans of Wyatt's vocals.\\" It was later issued in a heavily edited form (losing more than 10 minutes, with no explanation given) as a Japanese CD, and all later CD reissues have been cloned from this master. Home media In 2007 a DVD of The Animals Film was released with a new director's cut (running time 120 minutes), via Beyond the Frame. In 2008 the British Film Institute released a remastered DVD in the UK, incorporating both the original uncensored cinema version and the director's cut. In 2010 the BBC World Service broadcast One Planet: Animals & Us, a radio documentary series in which Victor Schonfeld investigates why little has changed since the making of The Animals Film.

Grobet spent some time as a painter before focussing on photography. Her photography led her to explore lucha libre and she spent a lot of time getting to know the luchadores (wrestlers). Grobet has done some theatre and video, and has published several books. Grobet has had quite a lot of exhibitions, and has received many grants and awards for her work.  Early life  Grobet was born in Mexico City, where she grew up with her parents. Grobet took a formal painting class at the Academy of San Carlos. Her parents did not like the views of the school and sent her to work under a Catholic professor named Jos√© Su√°rez Olvera, who painted murals for the Church of San Francisco. She did not care for his work much because she felt it lacked originality. Grobet asked herself what art is, ‚ÄúLooking around, and after asking myself the inevitable questions about what art is, it became clear that for me it was a language, a way of saying things, and so I had to find the best way of saying them.‚Äù  Education  Lourdes Grobet studied plastic arts at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico and graphic design and photography in Britain at Cardiff College of Art and Derby College for Higher Education. She was very moved by her professor Mathias Goeritz, from whom she learned that mass media showed a new way of expression. When Goeritz gave up teaching, he asked Grobet to be his assistant while he worked on stained glassed windows for the Mexico City Cathedral. She studied in England in 1977 and had done a few landscape paintings. She ended up failing, however, because the photography faculty did not like that she altered the landscape and strayed away from keeping it purely documentary.  Career  Katy Horna introduced Grobet to the world of photography, though the main influences in her early career were Mathias Goeritz, Gilberto Aceves Navarro, El Santo and others. Grobet studied as a painter in Mexico for some time and then took a trip to Paris in 1968, it changed her life and the way that she viewed the art world. While she was in Paris she visited a lot of art galleries and discovered Kinetic Art and because of this, she likes to work with Multi-Media. She spent some time working with a Jazz concert controlling lighting and kinetic projections. When Grobet returned to Mexico, she decided that she wanted to focus on photography, after she got back home she decided to burn all of her old work and start over. In 1981 Grobet released her first set of photographs. At the beginning of her career in photography, she was part of a group called Consejo Mexicano de Fotograf√≠a (Mexican Council of Photography), formed by Pedro Meyer in 1977. With her participation in this group, she was able to revitalize photography in Mexico, which lead to a movement called the Grupos. Grobet was focused on establishing a community-based perspective. Grobet spent some time with Indigenous people and during a time of great struggle for them. She took the time to learn more about them and photograph them in a theatrical way. She wanted to relate to Indigenous people using her artistic initiative, so they had made costumes and scenery of their own and she then took their photos. Later on, Grobet took interest in the Mayan culture. Wanting to learn more about the Mayans she went to the suburbs, this was a less common action, but she wanted to steer clear of any tourists. She wanted to get accurate information and explore an area less traveled. She discovered temples that were made by an unknown civilization and she decided they were to be called the Olmayazetec. After her education and her travels, she came back to Mexico. She once again started to explore her childhood interest of luchadores. She found that there was very little information pertaining to the luchadores and so she decided that she wanted to make them more known to the world. Grobet spent thirty years devoted to taking pictures of the luchadores and studying their way of life. She spent time photographing Lucha Libre wrestlers inside and outside of the ring, both in their masks, but also in their own homes. Grobet wanted to show that they lived normal lives, just like everyone else. She got very close with well known Lucha Libre wrestlers such as: El Santo, Blue Demon, Mil Mascaras, Sagrada, Octagon, Misioneros de la Muerte, Los Perros del Mal, and Los Brazos. Much influenced by Mathias Goeritz, the Polish sculptor from Gda≈Ñsk and by Gilberto Aceves Navarro, a Mexican master of art murals, who were her teachers, Lourdes Grobet worked on pictures of El Santo, one of the most important Mexican wrestlers, and a hero of Lucha libre who starred in more than 50 films. Since 1975, she has published more than photographs of the sport, including those on the sport in the United States since the 1930s, and as an important part of Mexican popular culture, adopting a sociological attitude. The sport involves many costumes and masks, leading it to a sport-carnival air which is much appreciated by Mexicans. Grobet has had over one hundred exhibitions of her photographs, both group and solo exhibitions. She had her work exhibited in the London Mexfest festival in 2012. She won an award at the Second Biennal in Fine art photography. In 1975, for the exhibition Hora y media, she transformed a gallery into a photographic laboratory. She developed the photographs, but without fixing them, and displayed them on three walls. While the public looked at the photographs, the lights from the gallery meant that they disappeared. In 1977, she presented Travelling, an exhibition of photography on an escalator. Among other works, she took: Paisajes pintados, Teatro campesino, Strip Tease.  Personal life  Grobet married Xavier Perez Barba in 1962 and they had four children together. They divorced in 1974.  Work and process  As Grobet is making her photographs, she desires to understand reality better. According to Grobet, and as noted in her 2004 book Lourdes Grobet: On the Eye‚Äôs Edge, ‚Äúshe has used this photographic experience as an inductive process in order to understand or 'live' reality (or realities) rather than illustrate certain preconceived ideas. She is not scared to employ different (sometimes contradictory) languages available to her to speak of her particular experience and standpoint, thus sacrificing formal purism. In her own way, Grobet manages to use photography to relate to herself, to relate to us and to take action in the problematic reality that is Mexico.‚Äù Some of the work that she does is collaborative, while others, she likes to do on her own time. When photographing the luchadores she wants to show their tough side, but she also wants to show the fragile side as well. Grobet wants to uncover the roots of the Lucha Libre. She wants to show that the Lucha Libre is important to the culture of Mexico and that they are meant to be related back to the time of the Aztecs. Grobet found that there was not much information found about these fascinating Luchadores. She wants the luchadores to get the recognition they deserve as Mexico's important cultural figure.

The Evergreen District member schools compete 3A and 4A. Since 2013, the district is used only for regular season competition. The Evergreen District was created to alleviate crowding in the Northwestern District caused by Liberty and Fauquier's return from AAA. The Northwestern District was thus split into two five-team districts, with the four schools in Frederick County joining with Skyline of Warren County and keeping the Northwestern District name. Warren County, being the eastern Warren County school, joined up with Brentsville and the three Fauquier County schools to form the Evergreen District. In 2013, Culpeper County High School and Eastern View High School entered the Evergreen District from the AA Battlefield District. The district dissolved in 2017 with the end of conference play, as most of the Evergreen District schools applied to join the Northwestern District. The lone exception was Eastern View, which chose to return to the Battlefield. The Northwestern District effectively absorbed the rest of the Evergreen District, creating a league of 13 schools.

It is recognised as a degree awarding institute under section 25A of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. In 2018, the parliament of Sri Lanka passed a special provisions act to abolish SAITM Medical faculty and to transfer the students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.https://www.srilankalaw.lk/gazette/2018_pdf/17-2018_E.pdf SAITM has become a highly controversial national issue with various segments questioning its standards and legality in terms of its operations as the only private medical college in the country. In July 2016 the government of Sri Lanka suspended the provision for new admissions at the medical faculty of SAITM. In February 2017 the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka upheld its legality and the validity of the medical degrees awarded by it, instructing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) register its graduates as medical doctors. SLMC has since appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, while as of yet the SLMC has not recognized the medical degree of SAITM for the purpose of Registration to Practise Medicine and Surgery in Sri Lanka under the Medical Ordinance. The SAITM medical course is one of only 17 programs worldwide that The General Medical Council of the United Kingdom has noted specifically by name as \\"medical qualifications (they) do not accept\\" https://www.gmc- uk.org/registration-and-licensing/join-the-register/before-you- apply/acceptable-overseas-qualifications/overseas-medical-qualifications-we- do-not-accept and is the only Sri Lankan Medical course not accepted by the GMC. In September 2018, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka upheld the decisions of the Court of Appeal ruling which directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council to register MBBS graduates of the SAITM.SC upholds ruling on registering SAITM medical students History The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine was established in 2008 by Dr. Neville Fernando with the aim to provide tertiary qualifications in medicine, engineering, and information technology, management and finance, and information communication technology and media. The institute was initially affiliated with the Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy (Russia), the Asian Institute of Technology (Thailand) and Buckinghamshire New University (England), awarding degrees through those respective institutes. In 2011 SAITM applied for recognition from the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a degree awarding institution, with the ability to award its own degrees. The UGC, in 2013, granted SAITM a degree awarding status despite protests from the Inter-University Students‚Äô Federation (IUSF) and the Government Medical Officers‚Äô Association (GMOA). SAITM held their first convocation in March 2013, conferring degrees to ten students from the Faculty of ICT and Media and eighteen students from the Faculty of Management and Finance. In 2017 President Maithripala Sirisena proposed to list SAITM on the stock exchange to as an answer to criticism on its ownerships allowing anyone to buy shares. Sirisena pointed out that over 75,000 to 85,000 Sri Lankan students go overseas annually for higher education which could be reduced if quality private universities exist in Sri Lanka. Health minister Rajitha Senaratne also echoed similar sentiment claiming that proper guidelines will be established to administer SAITM which will also be applicable to future international universities that have expressed willingness to expand into Sri Lanka. Following a fast unto death campaign performed by the parents of State Medical Students, on 8th Nov 2017, the Government of Sri Lanka, decided to abolish SAITM, suspend the new enrollments immediately and to do a fair inquiry to the students already enrolled in.http://www.sundaytimes.lk/article/1034512/saitm-to-be-abolished-new- enrollments-suspended-deputy-minister-harsha-de-silva Following the appeal put up by SLMC against the high court decision, was worded by the supreme court on 21 September 2018. It contains 55 pages which shows that Sri Lanka Medical Council(SLMC) purposefully not given the provincial registration for the SAITM graduates. Therefore Supreme court advice the give the provincial registration for the SAITM graduates from immediate effect without any condition. Degree programs In 2011 the Ministry of Higher Education recognized SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of Section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978. As such the UGC has approved SAITM to award the following degrees; *Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) - (2011) *Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Mechatronics Engineering - (2016) *Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Civil Engineering - (2016) Controversies Medical qualifications Sri Lanka In 2016 the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) have both publicly stated that they were opposed the provisional registration of medical graduates from SAITM to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka. But it was later over ruled by the court of appeal and it was informed that the graduates of SAITM can register with Sri Lanka Medical Council., SAITM graduates could register with Medical Council : DailyMirror. Recently parents and students of the SAITM requested to postpone the final examinations as they have had no or minimal formal clinical training. In 2017 Russian Ambassador Alexander Karchava also spoke up for SAITM and revealed that Nizhni Novgorod State Medical Academy has continuously expressed satisfaction with the training of Sri Lankan students and honors the ties with SAITM. According to him over 54 Russian doctors and professors worked in SAITM on a shift basis ensuring that SAITM students gain quality medical education. However Nizny Novgorod medical academy denies having any connections or affiliations with SAITM. According to Irina Tatarinova, Director National Accreditation Agency Russia, SAITM is not accredited in Russia: \\"The National Accreditation Agency maintains the Database of accredited Higher Education Institutions in the Russian Federation. This Database does not contain any information about Sri Lankan Campus of Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy. This means that this joint program is not accredited in Russia.\\" United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the General Medical Council has listed SAITM as an institution whose graduates from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine are ineligible for licensure. Issuing a statement titled \\"Overseas medical qualifications not accepted by the GMC\\", it said that the body would not accept applications to sit the PLAB test or for registration from graduates of the medical schools mentioned in it including the SAITM. Wasim Thajudeen murder case On 3 October 2016, the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka confiscated 26 human body parts from the institute's laboratory during a search operation carried out to locate the missing body parts of suspected murder victim Wasim Thajudeen. Staff Controversies Sameera Senaratne In early February 2017, two men travelling on a motor bike wearing full-face helmets opened fire at the car of SAITM's Director of Medical Education Sameera Senaratne http://www.saitm.edu.lk/fac_of_medicine/staff_adm.htm who was at the wheel at the time of the incident, at Malabe. He did not suffer any injuries despite the attackers allegedly shooting at him at close range. Subsequent inquiries raised suspicion that the shooting was staged by Senaratne and a politician known to him, to depict the anti-SAITM protests brewing in the country at the time in an unfavourable light.

Richard's first solo album, En Forme!! (1981) featured some of the members of Etron Fou Leloublan, which was still active at the time. On En Avant Richard explored his interest in language and culture, which developed during his studies of Medieval Literature at Grenoble in south-eastern France in the early 1970s.

After its cancellation, it would be the last such program on the channel until Neues aus der Anstalt premiered in January 2007. About the show History Notizen aus der Provinz was the second attempt to establish a political cabaret show in German television after the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) had tried out a similar concept, Hallo Nachbarn! (based on the BBC show That Was The Week That Was), in 1963. Hildebrandt had previously worked on R√ºckblende for the NDR in which he featured in the persona of a politics- analysing roofer. Conception The program was created as a satirical news magazine and as such did not feature an intricate studio decoration. Instead, Hildebrandt ‚Äî feigning provincial innocence ‚Äî would sit on a desk and comment on recent events from a satirical perspective, combined with 3-5 minute long clips about the subjects. Reception The show proved soon to be popular with the audience, receiving an audience rating between 30% and 45%. Controversy Like Hildebrandt's later program, Scheibenwischer, the Notizen were frequently attacked by conservative politicians, most notably by those of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) and the Christian Democratic Union which served only to increase its popularity. ZDF stopped production and broadcasting of two episodes as their content was deemed too controversial by the channel's bosses: In 1975, parts of an episode concerning abortion were censored and not broadcast. The censored parts contained the introduction of a fictional new law that would make sterilisation mandatory based on the number of the Personalausweis of men affected. Hildebrandt was awarded the Adolf- Grimme-Preis in 1976 for those parts. The 45th episode, due to be broadcast on 27 October 1977 and to deal with the topic of terrorism and the German Autumn, was cancelled. According to ZDF, the decision not to produce the episode was made by the editorial staff of the program while Hildebrandt commented in his autobiography Was bleibt mir anders √ºbrig that the channel's management had deemed terrorism a taboo topic for satire and unsuitable for coverage in the program. Indefinitely on hiatus In 1979, the ZDF chief of programming Dieter Stolte urged for the program to be put on hold. Officially this was declared as a \\"creative break\\" although Hildebrandt and others surmised that Stolte wanted to avoid the show influencing the 1980 federal elections. In the same year, ZDF stopped the collaboration with Hildebrandt who was considered \\"politically biased\\". Hildebrandt's persona as the innocent commentator from the province proved to be easily identifiable by the public and as such, identification with his satirical opinions about politicians was deemed very likely. Officially the program is still on hiatus, with \\"Jahr des Kindes\\" being the last episode aired on 22 November 1979. Legacy After the effective cancellation of the Notizen, Hildebrandt switched to the Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) where he founded the Scheibenwischer as a similar program that ran until 2009. ZDF would ban political cabaret from its programming until January 2007, when it was decided to broadcast a new cabaret program, Neues aus der Anstalt.

He has been described as one of South Florida's \\"most recognizable artists\\", and \\"almost an institution\\" in the art world for his wide range of media, projects, and locations. Personal history Le Batard was born in New York City in 1972 to Cuban immigrant parents, Gonzalo and Lourdes Le Batard. He was raised in South Florida, where he attended the Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School in Hollywood, Florida. then Florida International University. Overcoming a lack of support and encouragement from his preparatory school, he entered and won the 1990 Silver Knight Award for art in Broward County, Florida, and later judged that competition. He was a lecturer in residence at the International Museum of Cartoon Art while attending Florida International University, which he graduated in 1995. He is the younger brother of Miami sportswriter Dan Le Batard, who hosts the radio and television program The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz. David occasionally makes appearances on his brother's show despite the fact that he has, by his own admission, never willingly attended a sporting event. He also serves as the show's art director, designing television graphics and its studio at the Clevelander Hotel. Themes and influences LeBatard refers to his work as \\"postmodern cartoon art expressionism\\". He often depicts musicians and musical metaphors, inspired by street art and Cuban music. His visual style involves \\"soulful\\" line-based abstractions against bold flat color backgrounds. > The obvious example in terms of art is the recent example of Shepard Fairey. > But I think the cool thing about art, especially if you do public art - and > I've done a lot of murals growing up and stuff like that - is that it really > is one of the most democratic ways to deliver a message.

He has since exhibited in galleries throughout the United States. His works include a number of murals and other public art installations in Detroit, New Orleans, and South Florida and bicycle racks. A mural he painted for American football star Ricky Williams appeared on television when Williams' home was featured on MTV Cribs. Lebo was also painted contestants for a Miami-based challenge for the TV show \\"Russia's Next Top Model.\\" LeBatard has collaborated extensively with various musicians. He appeared and toured with Thievery Corporation, the Beastie Boys, Bela Fleck, Burning Spear, Disco Biscuits, Cuban band Conjunto Progresso, and Arturo Sandoval, among others, creating live art while the groups performed. He has also designed CD cover art and other artwork for Phish, The Spam Allstars, and the Latin Grammys. He has appeared in Mexico City, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Jamaica for various site-specific art projects, including a trip to the Amazon funded by the Ford Foundation. LeBatard has been commissioned for commercial art by Bacardi, Adidas, Gibson Guitars, Nestle, Macy's, the Miami Heat, Calvin Klein, \\"Zo's Summer Groove\\", and the Langerado Music Festival. He has also worked in the media of fabric, aircraft exteriors, cruise ship hull artwork, stained glass, furniture (he collaborated with designer Ralh Pucci, among others), and flower shows. In 2008 he collaborated with an Italian tile manufacturer to design the world's largest mosaic mural in Venice, Italy. He also painted the hull art of the Miami-themed ship Norwegian Getaway by Norwegian Cruise Line.

A show with a loyal following over the years, Moon River was canceled by WLW in 1953 in an effort to modernize the schedule, but revived the next summer due to continued listener outcry. In the decade after the program's final broadcast in 1970, a series of Moon River concerts were held in Cincinnati which recreated the program in front of a live audience. In 1969, the show was cut back to Saturday nights only, due to conflicts with the Cincinnati Royals and the fact that Jim LaBarbara's contemporary music show aired from 7 pm to midnight. A Cincinnati Enquirer article from 1970 said that the show had ended shortly thereafter. In 1995, WMKV revived it, with Myers as narrator, for a four-year run.

Development Development of the SZD-41 Jantar Standard was relatively quick due to using the fuselage and tail unit of the SZD-38 Jantar 1 and fitting 15 m span wings complying with the Standard class specification. The prototype SZD-41, limited to 235 km/h, no winch launching or aerobatics, first flew in October 1973 piloted by Adam Zientek. The two prototypes, SZD-41-1 SP-2685 (construction number X-110) and SZD-41-2 SP-2686 (c/n X-111), were entered in the 1974 World Gliding Championships at Waikerie in Australia, taking 3rd and 7th places in the Standard class. In 1976, at R√§ysk√§l√§ in Finland, SZD-41As took 4th, 6th and 18th places in the World Gliding Championships Standard Class. Competition results and measured flight tests revealed that the SZD-41A was more or less the equal of direct competitors, such as the Schempp-Hirth Standard Cirrus and Schleicher ASW 19.Simons, Martin. Sailplanes 1965-2000 2nd revised edition. EQIP Werbung und Verlag G.m.b.H.. K√∂nigswinter. 2005. Unfortunately, the production methods left the epoxy laminates prone to shrinkage which drastically affected performance due to the sensitive aerodynamics of the aerofoil sections used. The SZD-41A Jantar Standard was built primarily of Fibreglass-Epoxy resin composite with local strengthening from welded steel tube in the fuselage centre-section, foam ribs in the wings and plywood at equipment mounting points. The skin was composed of fibreglass laminates laid up in moulds to attain accurate profiles. The monowheel manually retractable landing gear hung from the steel tube centre section structure which also mounted the towing hook and wing attachments. Large plate style airbrakes aft of the mainspar extend from the top and bottom surfaces, with the gaps sealed by spring-loaded covers when closed, also operating the disk brake on the monowheel at full extension. The cantilever fibreglass-epoxy tailplane is attached to the top of the fin, trimming of the elevator was achieved by spring loading the control stick and adjusting the neutral loading position. 80 litres (later 100) of water ballast could be carried in plastic tanks in the wings and jettisoned as required. The semi-reclining seat is in a comfortable cockpit enclosed by a two-part canopy, the front part fixed and the rear hinged to open rearwards for entry/exit. After modifications to remove restrictions on the prototypes and improvements required after flight testing, production of the SZD-41A and SZD-41B Jantar Standard commenced, continuing till 1978 when 159 had been built, many of which were exported worldwide. In common with many SZD products, the aircraft was delivered with a full range of basic instruments from Polish suppliers, which led to the famous punch-line: \\"There I was, 50ft, inverted, nothing on the clock but the makers' name, and that was in (expletive redacted) Polish\\" used in Gliding Club Bars throughout the world to humourise recovery from perilous situations.

The film is a sequel to the 1967 film One-Armed Swordsman, with Jimmy Wang and Lisa Chiao Chiao reprising their roles. A sequel was released in 1971 entitled The New One-Armed Swordsman. Plot The eponymous character, played by Jimmy Wang, has hung up his signature broken sword and is living peacefully with his wife. Meanwhile, a band of tyrannical sword masters called the Eight Sword Kings are challenging the masters of all rival schools in an effort to take over the martial arts community. Any that refuse are murdered by the Eight Kings' twin enforcers, the Black and White Knights. After capturing all the rival masters, the Eight Kings deliver an ultimatum; all the rival schools' students must cut off their sword arms and surrender the severed limbs to the Eight Kings, or the students' beloved teachers will all die. The students turn to the legendary One-Armed Swordsman, who is at first reluctant, especially when one student kidnaps his wife to force him to help, but is convinced when a student actually does sacrificially chop his own arm off in despair. The One-Armed Swordsman must then contend with the unique styles and weapons of the Eight Kings: * Winged Blade (or Flying Dragon in another translation dub) uses his speed and leaping prowess to attack from the air. One-Arm bests him and his students with a variety of ground-based traps. * Hooking Blade wields a chained sickle. One-Arm defeats him by hanging him by his own weapon from a tree, allowing One-Arm to eviscerate him. * Buried Blade hides in pits before leaping out to ambush his opponents. One-Arm bests him by chopping down bamboo to pin down his students and then standing atop the trunks, keeping him out of reach of Buried Blade's attacks to stab him with a bamboo spear. * Whirling Blade wields a pair of bladed bucklers which can also be thrown as projectiles. One-Arm catches the blades on his sword and flings them back at their owner. * Mighty Blade uses his immense strength and giant two handed sword to overpower his opponents. After luring him outside the Kings' fort, the students drop a net over him to restrain him as they mutilate him. * Thunder Blade wields smokebombs and a sword whose blade conceals a smoke sprayer and a shotgun. After using water to douse the smoke, One-Arm uses a cloth shield to block the pellets before cutting him down. * Thousand Blade (or One Thousand Fingers) the only female King uses her sexuality to lull her targets into lowering their guard before killing them with the many knives concealed in the sleeves of her robe. After failing to seduce One-Arm, she is fatally stabbed by one of the students she seduced and wounded. * Unseen Blade (the Unseen) the leader of the Eight Kings uses deception and distraction to confuse his opponents along with a collapsible sword whose blade can extend during battle and also has a hidden hook. One-Arm uses his skill in close range combat and left handed sword fighting to get inside Unseen's range and slice off his sword arm.

It was because of her impressive sermons on the holy Gita that she was dubbed 'Gita Bharati' at the age of 10 years by Rajendra Prasad, who was then the President of India. At the age of 14 years she took sanyas diksha and was termed as Mahamandaleshwar at 18 years of age.

Shelagh Cluett (17 December 1947 ‚Äì 25 July 2007) was an artist and fine art lecturer working in London, England, from the late 1960s until 2007. Cluett became a recognised figure on the London art scene in the early 1980s with exhibitions of her large metal sculptures appearing internationally. She worked at Chelsea School of Art and Design as a lecturer, and after 25 years, took up the position of Head of Postgraduate Studies in 2006. Early life and education Cluett was born in Bournemouth, Dorset, on 17 December 1947. She moved to London in 1968 as an undergraduate at Hornsey College of Art. In 1971, she went to Chelsea School of Art and Design to study on the postgraduate course. Early artistic career Cluett's early artwork shows an interest in geological structures which remains traceable throughout her oeuvre. The landscape-like cross sections, seen in the images of her final show at Hornsey, quickly gave way to more resolutely abstract forms as her style progressed; tall sculptures inhabit their environs with strong lines, jumping and curving to and fro, as if enacting a complicated choreographed dance. Closer inspection reveals that these apparently weightless structures are in fact a complex combination of media. Wire, aluminium, wax, clay, wood and bitumen are systematically layered over each other creating a distinctly crafted effect, at odds with the overall appearance of the work. Accompanying her larger works are smaller 'thinking pieces', in which Cluett explored different colours, shapes, and ideas. With shows at the Ikon GalleryIkon Gallery , UK. in 1979, and then at Nicola Jacobs Gallery and ACME GalleryACME Gallery, UK. in 1980 Cluett became established on the British art scene, subsequently showing extensively in the UK and abroad. During this period she also forged strong links in the world of art education, acting as visiting lecturer and examiner to many different art schools up and down the country. She set up the postgraduate course in sculpture at Chelsea College of Art in 1980. The 1980s and '90s Vogue.EnglishwomanVogue, December 1984, p189. In the mid 1980s Cluett's work began to move away from linear forms to explore the influences of her travels in the Far East; they provided her with a new wealth of imagery and an intensified palette, lending greater freedom to her sculpture.Shelagh Cluett, Shelagh Cluett Recent Sculpture, Herbert Art gallery, Coventry (1985). Colours gathered greater importance; applied to more expansive hammered metal surfaces, they cause the work to shine and glisten. Though travel research was an integral part of Cluett's working process, it had to be fitted around her commitments at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where she had become a Principal Lecturer and head of the MA Sculpture course. She exhibited her works in Briain and internationally, in France, South Korea, India and the United States. Cluett became increasingly fascinated by the charged relationships between the spiritual and the physical in the buildings she saw ‚Äì the sacred landscape of the architecture. She began to use the computer to manipulate temple plans, shaping them to position the viewer in relation to the structure. The plan was then sandblasted on to a stone slab, which left it in polished relief against the vulnerable surface of the exposed stone. Cluett believed this practice created tensions in her work; the juxtaposed surfaces at once drawing the viewer in with tactility of the stone, and pushing them away with the manipulation of the plan, eventually leaving them to float somewhere in between. Exploring the digital medium - later work In the later works such as the Maps Without Territories Series (images/sculptures made in the 1990s and early 2000s) stone slabs were shown with images taken from deep within the temples. The photographs taken by Cluett at the end of her own journey into the building, served as a means of appropriation, and also to pinpoint a specific moment in the life of the building. Cluett's strong belief in the importance of computers as an artist's medium, was reflected both in her work as a sculptor and as a lecturer. She was a founding member of FADE (Fine Art Digital Environment), which operated between Camberwell College of Arts and Chelsea providing facilities and advice to students, and presented work at a number of 'digital art' conferences across the globe. The Khajuraho Series (2002‚Äì03) based on the Khajuraho temple complex, exhibited at the V&A; (2003) in an exhibit called Digital Responses, showcases the combination of digital imagery, video, and sculpture, which became increasingly typical in Cluett's work. Plans of the buildings were superimposed across photographs of sculpted figures, resembling tattoos, in an attempt to unite the bodies with the architecture and each other. Cluett then employed the tattooed figures as tools in her subsequent project, which sought to uncover a latent sensuality in the digital surface. The resultant work was Under the Skin (2003), a film made using LCD screens and video equipment. Using glitches which occurred in the different digital apparatus when zooming in and out of images on the screen, and layering them with other imagery, Cluett made a film with the depth and richness she desired. Dead Ahead (2004) and Sea Fever (2005) are two digital projects that reflect and develop the discoveries made by Cluett in Under the Skin. Cluett's thoughts and ideas surrounding the sea and coastline ‚Äì omnipresent elements in her life ‚Äì are played out in imagery which presents the constant flux of the strand. By using the same image in several different programmes Cluett discovered that information often got scrambled, creating 'incidents' on the surface, and leaving behind a visual history of the image.Fade Fine Art Digital Environment , UK. She also realised that in slowing down or speeding up a recorded image, the corresponding sound accompaniment was effected in the same way, inadvertently providing a soundtrack to her work. Pursuing her interest in pixellation, and the breakdown of an image, Cluett's attentions turned to early mosaics ‚Äì a type of primitive pixellation. On various trips to ancient sites of Roman inhabitation (such as Pompeii and Ostia Antica), Cluett documented a great number of mosaics and their surrounding context. This material was used to make two new films Ostia I and II (2006‚Äì07) as well as twisted and extruded digital images of mosaics, intended for projection on to unusual surfaces in an attempt at \\"cross fertilisation\\" of media. A project unfortunately left unfinished upon her death. Cluett died in London on 25 July 2007 after suffering an aggressive cancer. The Shelagh Cluett Trust The Shelagh Cluett Trust has been set up in her name, and there is an extensive archive of her work which documents her career as a sculptor from the late 1960s until 2007.

R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology is a scholarly study of the Middle-earth works of J. R. R. Tolkien written by Tom Shippey and first published in 1982. Two further editions extended and updated the work, including a discussion of Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of the Rings. Book Synopsis The book discusses Tolkien's inspiration in creating the world of Middle-earth and the writing of works including The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. A recurrent theme is that of Tolkien's detailed linguistic studies (particularly of Old Norse and Old English) and the creation of languages (such as Sindarin and Khuzdul) which feature prominently throughout his works. This was informed by Shippey's tenure at the University of Oxford, teaching the same syllabus as Tolkien at a time when Tolkien still spent time there. Shippey discusses the possible location of the original Mirkwood, a term reused by Tolkien, in the 4th- century Goth-Hun borderlands between the Carpathian Mountains and the River Dnieper, their mentions in legend analysed and reconstructed by philology. The book begins by explaining Tolkien's philology, his belief in its ability to show what happened as the Gothic empire fell in the 4th century, and his feeling that if he reconstructed an imagined past on such foundations, it would not be wholly false. It then examines the origins of The Hobbit, how Tolkien rebuilt a picture of Elves and Dwarves from the available clues, and from the different ways of speaking of each race, how he ended up writing a richly-characterised story. Three chapters then explore The Lord of the Rings, its map-based plot, its elaborate interlacement of narrative threads, and its underlying mythical and Christian themes. A chapter examines The Silmarillion's origins and structure; another looks at Tolkien's minor works. An appendix discusses Tolkien's many sources, from the Elder Edda and Beowulf through to the many languages that Tolkien knew. Also attached are four of Tolkien's \\"asterisk\\" poems, written to appear to be the ancient origins of more recent works: for instance, Ofer Widne Garsecg is stated by Tolkien to be \\"An Old English version of 'Twas in the broad Atlantic in the equinoctial gales / That a young fellow fell overboard among the sharks and whales'\\". Two of the poems concern the Birch tree, symbolising to Tolkien the \\"B\\" stream of English studies at Oxford, which covered \\"Lang[uage]\\" (including Old English) as opposed to \\"Lit[erature]\\" (including Shakespeare). In the third edition, the book concludes with a chapter on Peter Jackson's film versions; it notes their enormous popular and commercial success, and considers how far the films are faithful to the book. In Shippey's view, the films tend both to \\"democratisation\\" and to \\"emotionalisation\\" of the narrative, though he welcomes the fact that Jackson has brought a fresh audience to Tolkien's work. Publication history In Great Britain, the book was first published by Allen & Unwin in 1982. The book is published by Houghton Mifflin in the United States. The second edition, published by HarperCollins in 1993, included discussion of the 12-volume History of Middle-earth edited by Tolkien's son Christopher Tolkien. The third edition, published in 2003, added a chapter on Peter Jackson's film version. A Polish edition was published in 2001 by Wydaw. Zysk i S-ka at Pozna≈Ñ. A Spanish edition was brought out by Planeta-De Agostini in Barcelona in 2002. A Russian edition appeared in 2003, published by Limbus Press of Saint Petersburg. A German edition was published by Klett- Cotta in Stuttgart in 2018. Reception Jessica Yates, in Mythlore, writes that Shippey, a holder of Tolkien's old professorial chair at Leeds, and a Tolkien fan, had two goals for the book: to explain to instinctive lovers of Lord of the Rings why they are right to do so; and to refute the hostile criticism from literary figures like Edmund Wilson. She states that this second reason explains \\"the rigorous tone\\" of the book. Kirkus Reviews calls the work \\"In sum: the most useful book on Tolkien since the Carpenter biography\\". The review describes the book as an \\"erratically enlightening study\\", one that sometimes goes into great detail on minute points, but that powerfully sets out a major thesis. This is, states the review, that clues from philological study - Tolkien's profession - of Old English and other languages of that period suggested \\"the greatness of some hidden pre-literate Northern past\\", and that Tolkien set about inventing \\"the world that should have existed for legend to take place in, and constructed the epic that should have lain behind the 'asterisk-world' of philogical conjecture\\". Gergely Nagy, in Tolkien Studies, writes that the 2005 revision is \\"the good old Road\\", with useful additions. The book was in his view from 1982 \\"emblematic\\" of the \\"source-study\\" or \\"comparative study\\" approach to Tolkien criticism. Nagy notes that the book has been described as \\"the single best thing written on Tolkien\\", and calls it \\"the seminal monograph\\". Glen GoodKnight, founder of the Mythopoeic Society and writing in Mythlore, describes The Road to Middle- earth as \\"the best single book written on Tolkien\\". He notes that Shippey comments in the preface to the second edition that he had not had to make many changes despite the publication of Christopher Tolkien's detailed The History of Middle-earth. Charles Moseley, in The Observer, writes that the book demonstrated that Shippey was \\"one of Tolkien's most acute critics and convincing apologists\\". Awards In 1984 the first edition of the book received the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies, an award \\"given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien ... that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship.\\" See also * J. R. R.

Although chiefly known today for having written the libretto for Donizetti's 1835 opera, Maria Stuarda, he played a prominent role in the judiciary of Naples in the years leading up to the unification of Italy. Biography Pizzo, the small seaside town in southern Italy, where Giuseppe Bardari was born in 1817. Giuseppe Bardari was born in Pizzo and studied in Monteleone (now Vibo Valentia) before going to Naples to study law. During his student days in Naples, he also wrote poetry and frequented the city's salons where he came into contact with the liberal ideals of the Italian Risorgimento. He earned a reputation as a promising literary figure and was only 17 when Donizetti engaged him as the librettist for Maria Stuarda.Ashbrook (1983) pp. 583-584 It was Bardari's only known libretto. Ashbrook has speculated that the censorship problems he encountered (which resulted in the work being banned in Naples and demands for drastic changes in Milan) may have led him to pursue his legal career instead. He returned to his law studies and eventually became a magistrate in Monteleone.Fagnano (2006) p. 14 However, he lost that position in 1848 following his anti-government activities during an uprising in Calabria. He returned to private practice as a lawyer and became a close friend of Liborio Romano, an important figure in the Risorgimento. Towards the end of Bourbon rule in southern Italy, he returned to public life and became the Prefect of Police for Naples. On 6 September 1860, he published a manifesto announcing the departure of King Francis II and his court, as Garibaldi and his troops advanced on the city. In his manifesto, he reminded the Neapolitans of their duties as citizens during the period of change, and urged them to remain calm and support the new government.Bardari's manifesto is reproduced in Garibaldi (1860) pp. 876-878 According to Pagnotta, he was also the author of the King's own farewell proclamation to the Neapolitans, as well as his address to the nations of Europe.Pagnotta (2006) After Naples finally fell under the control of Garibaldi on 7 September 1860, the provisional government appointed Bardari Councillor of the Gran Corte dei Conti (the financial court of Naples, similar in function to the French Cour des comptes).Atti del governo estratti dal giornale officiale di Napoli (1860) Issue 1, pp. 3-4 He was also appointed President of the commission administering the former assets of the Jesuit Order in the territory comprising the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.Atti del governo estratti dal giornale officiale di Napoli (1860) Issue 3, p. 25. Under Garibaldi, the Jesuit Order, which had supported the Bourbon regime, was disbanded throughout the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and all their assets were confiscated. See also: Garibaldi (1860) pp. 338 and 742-743. Considered an Italian patriot by Garibaldi despite his service under Francis II, Giuseppe Bardari was on the brink of a new political career in the unified Kingdom of Italy when he died in Naples at the age of 44.

Since their formation, the band has released three albums. This band is known for its locally influenced music and tunes invoking the Maldivian culture and heritage. Band history From Zero Degree Atoll website. Formation Zero Degree Atoll formed in 1987 with childhood friends Nashid and Mohoj collaborating with fellow music aficionado Ahmed. Their debut song Reethi Handhuvaru ‚Äì about the natural beauty and serenity of the Maldives ‚Äì was produced together with Worldview International Foundation and the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Maldives. The video for the song was shown on Television Maldives to raise environmental awareness among locals and the band gained national recognition. The trio then embarked on a musical journey of discovery and experimentation that would result in them being linked by a strong bond lasting to this day. In 1988, the band began to work on their first album, travelling across the Maldivian isles and living with local communities while immersing themselves in island culture. They recorded various soundbites that made up the natural rhythms of laid-back atoll lifestyles. These soundbites paid tribute to the traditional and cultural distinctiveness in local routines like the cadent clinging of oars on water and the swishing of winnowing rice. These were then interspliced into the band‚Äôs music resulting in an album that rang with early morning birdcalls, the thumping of coconut husks and the dancing of waves ashore. The very essence of Zero Degree Atoll‚Äôs inherent national charm lay in their encompassment of traditional poetry and archaic chants as well as the inclusion of the locally esteemed bodu beru ‚Äì literally meaning big drum ‚Äì in their songs. The attention garnered to the complex nuances of the mother tongue has led to the band being one of the most sought-after live acts on local terrain, as well a vastly popular act for visiting international audiences. Active Years From its conception, the band went on to make a number of appearances on the international arena in addition to their countless performances on national stages. In 1991, they performed in Switzerland on an invitation by the country to mark its 700th year of Independence. In 1992, a concert was held in Male‚Äô to mark the release of Dhoni album. The show was an undeniable musical sensation. They represented the Maldives thrice at the International Tourism Fair (ITB) in Berlin, in 1993, 1995 and 1997. In August 1996, the band signed up with a French recording company for the professional production of the songs in Dhoni Album. Recorded at the Couleur Studio in France, the Album Island Pulse was a more westernised version of Dhoni with more guitars, more drums and more versatility. This album was marketed in Europe and in the Maldives, focusing particularly on spreading island music to the tourists arriving to the country. In September 2000, the band performed at the Sun Club in D‚Äôuville in France. In March 2004, Zero Degree Atoll performed in Male‚Äô as a part of the ‚ÄòOne World Beat‚Äô Global Music Festival to help children living with HIV/Aids. Today Zero Degree Atoll continues to tour the region, bringing their distinctive music to their stronghold, the fan-base which has been loyally supporting them throughout the twenty years of its existence. The band‚Äôs popularity is upheld by generations of Maldivians who find the music just as inspirational, innovative and influential as they did twenty years ago. On 18 May 2007, on the Northeastern beach of Male‚Äô the capital of the Maldives, the island gathered to witness a spectacle: with wide eyes, raised hands and craving ears, the audience experienced the band onstage at their latest appearance, at the show ‚ÄòThe Sound of a Nation‚Äô. From the band‚Äôs upbeat performance onstage, the audience echoed the lyrics down below. Like archaic mythical stories passed down for generations, Zero Degree Atoll‚Äôs music had become unmistakably legendary. on December 7, 2012 Zero Degree Atoll performed in Taj Samudra in colombo as part of a fund raiser for their founding member Nashid who was diagnosed with cancer earlier the same year. this was raised funds for cancer association of the Maldives. Nashid died on October 10, 2016 after battling with cancer for almost 5 years. His last public appearance took place weeks before when he attended a show organised by local artists as a tribute to him. Since its conception in the late eighties where the island rhythms and sounds were commonplace among the locals, the band has evidently come a long way. The environment has changed, the sounds that once inspired the band‚Äôs early music have disappeared. Engines have replaced oars, sound of the traffic has replaced the shushing of the waves. The island now pulses to a different beat. What lives on is the music that once had the ingenious insight of encapsulating those sounds of what the nation once was, and because of the timelessness of their songs, that it will always be.

This would make it a candidate for the oldest known manuport. Archived by the Internet Archive, original URI was A local school teacher Wilfred I. Eitzman found it in the Makapansgat, a dolerite cave in the Makapan Valley north of Mokopane, Limpopo, South Africa in 1925. It had been described in literature and featured in the television program The Roots of Art in November 1967, before it gained new attention in 1974 when Raymond Dart (who had first seen it shortly after it was found) published a new interpretation. While Eitzman had already suggested it was brought, because of the resemblance to a face, to the cave, Dart recognized other faces when the stone is viewed from different angles.OriginsNet: Pebble of many facesDart, R.A. (1974): The waterworn australopithecine pebble of many faces from Makapansgat. South African Journal of Science 70: 167-169.|url=https://journals.co.za/content/sajsci/70/6/AJA00382353_4093David, 98-100 The Makapansgat pebble cannot be seen as art if a usual definition of the term is used, as the object was found and not made. Nevertheless that an Australopithecus may have recognized a face would reveal that the early hominid had some sort of capacity for symbolic thinking, necessary for the development of art and language. Whether the early hominid had really seen this object as a face, as well as whether it had magical speculations towards this object or just enjoyed the pebble, remains unclear. Factors adding to the uncertainty surrounding the piece is that we do not know exactly where in the cave it was found, nor the Australopithecus species the bones are from, nor whether they had been brought into the cave by animal scavengers.David, 99  See also  * Venus of Berekhat Ram References *David, Bruno, Cave Art, 2017, Thames and Hudson, External links *Photograph of the Magapansgat pebble and article by Robert G.

The documentary is about a Czech researcher, Tom√°≈° Ry≈°ka, who goes to the Thai and Laotian mountains in order to search and document the causes of wrongdoing and violence done to the indigenous peoples and their children by Christian missionaries. According to the film, the missionaries' altruistic intentions of converting these indigenous people to Christianity hide the human rights violations of land theft, forced relocation, cultural genocide and imposition of power with a racist view on their society. The crimes which the Christian missionaries are accused of include kidnapping of children from their villages to work in tea plantations and the selling of children into the sex trade. The documentary contrasts the apparent wealth and cleanliness of the missionaries with the undercover child trafficking that they carry out. One missionary is seen expressing regret over the revelation of this reality to the outside world as a threat to the continuing work of their organizations among these people.Engage Media fPcN videosAKHA - Prisoners of a White God Overview The Akha are a people group who inhabit the mountain regions of Southeast Asia. They live in small villages and cultivate crops such as rice and opium (a cash crop and medicine for them) using slash-and-burn agriculture. Their lives are governed by a spiritual/legal system called Akhazang. Like other hill tribes, the Akha do not have Thai citizenship. As of the beginning of the 21st century, their traditional way of living was being attacked by the Thai and Laotian governments, Christian missionaries, and Western NGOs. Film summary  Thailand  Prisoners of a White God begins with a Christian missionary preaching in the streets of Thailand. Then it transitions to an overview of Akha village life and spirituality, which is being increasingly encroached on by Western missionaries who have taken children under the pretense of educating them. These children live in missions and orphanages, speak only Thai, and are not allowed to learn about the traditional Akha ways. Using an assumed identity, Ry≈°ka investigates the living conditions of Akha children in Chiang Rai area missions and orphanages. Many of the children in the orphanages have parents that are still alive, and there is a glaring contradiction between the relative luxury missionaries live in and the poverty of many Akha villages. One missionary, an Akha named \\"Luka,\\" owns a tea plantation but manages to avoid hiring employees thanks to the labor provided by the Akha children at the orphanage he runs. One missionary, \\"Vern,\\" discusses how the goal of educating Akha children was to ultimately return them to their home villages to proselytize among their own people. Two others compare the Karen, who have accepted Christianity more readily, to the \\"aggressive\\" Akha. However, Ry≈°ka explains that the children become adjusted to life in greater society and have a difficult time coping with traditional Akha life. A common theme the missionaries in the film expressed was how the Akha worship spirits and live in \\"fear.\\" The film contrasts the \\"fear\\" supposedly present in traditional Akha spirituality with the propaganda leaflets depicting hell being distributed in Akha villages. Ry≈°ka suggests that Christianity is the true religion of fear and explains in detail on how missionaries stir conflict in villages, buy land, and control converts. Using a hidden dictaphone, Ry≈°ka manages to record testimonies of sexual abuse committed by missionaries. With this evidence, he returns to Europe for six months.  Laos  Ry≈°ka is invited to Laos. Unlike Thailand, Laos is a communist society and the Akha are not subject to intense proselytization. However, the Laotian government has invited Western NGOs into the country as part of a poverty reduction campaign concerning ethnic minorities such as the Akha. The program involves relocating the Akha to lowland villages (where they deal with unscrupulous Lao customers) and road construction in their traditional lands. Ry≈°ka travels to a village in the highlands and finds that the Akha there still manage to practice their traditional lifestyle. However, they are no longer allowed to grow opium. Ry≈°ka alludes to the 2003 war on drugs in neighboring Thailand, which killed and injured many Akha whose livelihoods are dependent on opium cultivation. Returning to the lowlands, Ry≈°ka stumbles on an Akha man lying on a road. He visits a lowland Akha village, created via forced relocation, where the Akha succumb to malaria and become tourist curios. They live in poverty, without hope, and are dependent on international aid organizations. The Akha villagers allege that workers from ACF and NCA are involved in rape. Ry≈°ka returns to the mountain village, where he is welcomed with a feast. He realizes that it will probably the last time he will see the village and vows to tell the story of the Akha, convinced that the development program was a failure that harmed the Akha.  Return to and escape from Thailand  Ry≈°ka travels from Laos to Thailand. He meets a missionary who estimates that 80% of missionaries in the region \\"fuck around\\" with a preference for young male victims. After that meeting, other missionaries discover Ry≈°ka's actual intentions and conspire with corrupt police to detain and murder him. He is alerted by a friend who advises him to leave the country. As he leaves his hotel room, he encounters missionaries who try to put him into a car but manages to escape. Ry≈°ka hides in the garden of a Buddhist temple and contacts the Czech embassy, which advises him to leave the region. He manages to leave Chiang Rai by air despite encountering missionaries at the airport. As he leaves Thailand, Ry≈°ka questions if the good that the missionaries and Western NGOs do can negate the harm they have done to the Akha and expresses confident that he will be able to vindicate his deceit towards the missionaries interviewed in the film. The film concludes with footage of Ry≈°ka at the United Nations in New York City, where some of his findings are presented at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It also notes that the NCA changed its policies after an internal investigation confirms Ry≈°ka's findings and that other indigenous peoples around the world are suffering fates similar to that of the Akha.  Cast  *Tom√°≈° Ry≈°ka is a Czech anthropologist and the director of the film. He first met the Akha as a tourist to Thailand after graduating from Masaryk University. He returned to the region to study the ways of the Akha, which led him to create the film after learning about the abusive behavior of missionaries from an Akha chief. At the end of the film, it is mentioned that Ry≈°ka was pursuing a PhD in anthropology from Charles University and became a director at UWIP (United World of Indigenous Peoples), an NGO that researches indigenous people. *Luka, an Akha missionary.

(14th century), or , childhood name , was the son of Hino Suketomo, the dainagon (high counselor) to Emperor Go-Daigo. Kumawaka himself was also an attendant to Emperor Go-Daigo, with whom he is sometimes thought to have had a pederastic relationship.; He is best known for avenging his father by killing the lay monk Homma Sabur≈ç, who had Suketomo executed. Later, Kumawaka was sometimes portrayed in art as an example of filial piety. Chronicle Much of what is known about Kumawaka comes from the 14th century chronicle Taiheiki. As the story goes, Kumawaka's father, Suketomo dainagon, had been exiled to the island of Sado. Suspecting a conspiracy by the Imperial court, the Kamakura shogunate named Suketomo a major co-conspirator, and called for his execution. This order was relayed to the lay monk Homma Sabur≈ç, who presided over Sado island. The thirteen-year-old Kumawaka, who was in hiding at Ninna-ji, a main buddhist temple, caught wind of this news and traveled to Sado to be with his father one final time. Having arrived at Sado island, he was granted an audience with Homma Sabur≈ç. However, Homma would not let Kumawaka see his father, but instead had him lodged in a nearby residence. Eventually, Suketomo was beheaded before Kumawaka got the chance to meet him. Kumawaka was entrusted with his father's cremated remains, and he had them delivered to Mount K≈çya. Following this, Kumawaka feigned illness, and lay for several days in Homma's residence. During this time, he plotted his father's revenge. Revenge One night, Kumawaka snuck out unarmed, expecting to kill Homma's son. Instead, he came upon Homma himself, asleep in a different room. In the room, a lamp was burning brightly, and Kumawaka feared that disturbing the light would wake the monk. To solve this, he opened the door slightly, allowing moths to swarm in and extinguish the light. He picked up Homma's sword, but kicked his pillow to awaken the monk, thinking, \\"...to kill a sleeping man is no different than stabbing a corpse\\". When Homma woke up, Kumawaka stabbed him in the chest and throat, and fled to hide in a bamboo grove. The guards, seeing small bloodstained footprints, went out in search of him. Faced with a deep moat, Kumawaka climbed onto a bamboo, and weighed down the tip of the plant, allowing him to drop over on the other side. He then headed for the harbor for a ship to take him back to the main islands. Escape Kunimitsu and the yamabushi Daizenboh calling back the boat. by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. During the day, he hid in a field of hemp, where he observed over a hundred mounted men searching for him. Eventually, he came across an old monk, who, after listening to Kumawaka's story, carried him on his back to the harbor. At the harbor, the pair had great difficulty in finding a boat. When one vessel refused to heed the old monk's pleas for passage, the monk began chanting a prayer for the vessel to return. According to the text, a violent wind then appeared, threatening to capsize the boat. Seeing this, the boatmen cried out to the old monk to save them, and rowed back to shore. When they reached the shore, the winds calmed, and Kumawaka and the old monk got on the boat. The mounted pursuers had now caught up with them, and rode out onto shallow water in pursuit. However, the boat crew, ignoring their shouts, raised sails and journeyed safely to Echigo province.

Heng was born in Takeo Province into a middle-peasant family of Sino Khmer descent.Liang (1988), p. 27 He went on to become a prosperous businessman and landowner. He served in the civil service of colonial Cambodia, eventually reaching the grade of Oudom-Montrey (senior grade mandarin) by the mid-1950s.Cheng Heng , AFEAK, accessed 26-09-09 His early political career, during the period when Prince Norodom Sihanouk's Sangkum party controlled the country, is relatively obscure: he entered politics in 1958, and served as Secretary of State for Agriculture in 1961-2. He was elected as the Sangkum deputy for Takhmau in 1962, but lost in the 1966 elections to a rival candidate, a young Sihanoukist doctor called Keo Sann.Corfield, p.40. The 1966 election was the first in which the Sangkum fielded multiple candidates in each constituency. Heng subsequently returned via a 1967 by-election in Phnom Penh, and by 1970 was serving as President of Cambodia's National Assembly. Heng's levels of political support appear to have been limited up until 1970; aside from being President of the Assembly, he had previously been director of the main Phnom Penh prison. Immediately subsequent to the Cambodian coup of 1970, in which the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, engineered Sihanouk's removal, Heng was made Head of State until elections could be arranged. This was a largely ceremonial role, as Lon Nol had assumed most of the Head of State's political powers on an emergency basis: Sihanouk, from exile, was to dismiss Heng as an \\"insignificant puppet\\".Sihanouk, p.51 Apart from giving press conferences, Cheng Heng was also called on to receive visiting foreign politicians: William Shawcross relates an incident during Spiro Agnew's July 1970 visit to Phnom Penh, in which the Acting Head of State was forced to contend with United States Secret Service personnel training their guns on him while he was attempting to welcome Agnew to the Royal Palace.Shawcross, p.176 Nol subsequently used a political crisis to remove Heng and take over the role himself early in 1972.The 'crisis' was precipitated after Sirik Matak sacked a dissident Sihanoukist academic, Keo An - the brother of Keo Sann, Heng's opponent in the 1966 election. In 1973, after American pressure on Lon Nol to broaden political involvement, Heng was made Vice-Chairman of a 'High Political Council' set up to govern the country. The Council's influence was soon, however, sidelined, and Nol resumed personalist rule of the deteriorating Republic. In 1975, with the Khmer Rouge forces surrounding the capital, Heng's name was published on a list of \\"Seven Traitors\\" (also including Lon Nol, Sisowath Sirik Matak, In Tam, Long Boret, Sosthene Fernandez and Son Ngoc Thanh) who were threatened with immediate execution in the event of a Communist victory. Heng fled the country on April 1 for Paris, where he became associated with the group of exiles centred on Son Sann. Heng returned to Cambodia after the UN-brokered 1991 political settlement (the Paris Peace Agreements) and had some further involvement in politics, founding the Republican Coalition Party which unsuccessfully took part in the 1993 elections. He died on 15 March 1996 at the age of 86. References Sources *Corfield, J. Khmers Stand Up!

He belonged to the most known of the pioneer generation of actors at the first Swedish theatre. He was the director of the Lindahl theater company in 1754-68, one of the two first travelling Swedish language theater companies. Life Peter Lindahl's father was a secretary, as well as he himself before he became an actor. In 1737, he participated in the first Swedish language original play to be performed at inauguration of the first Swedish theatre in Bollhuset in Stockholm, Den Svenska Spr√§tth√∂ken by Carl Gyllenborg, in the part of M√•ns. As such, he was also the first Swedish actor known by name to have performed a par tin a different gender, as the male M√•ns reveals in the play that he is actually as woman, Brita, dressed as a man. In 1740‚Äì54, he was one of the three directors in the board of directors at the theatre with Charles Langlois and Johan Palmberg. He was regarded as a comedian star and the theatre's main Harlequin interpreter, and acted in plays by Moli√®re, Voltaire and Corneille. In 1754, the Swedish theatre was evicted from the localities of Bollhuset and replaced with the French Du Londel Troupe. The Swedish actors split in two travelling theaters, one under Petter Stenborg and one under Lindahl, the likely first Swedish language travelling troupe, in companionship with Johan Bergholtz. He married his colleague the actress Margareta Maria Fabritz in 1742. His theatre troupe was taken over by his son-in-law Carl Seuerling in 1768, and later by his daughter, Margareta Seuerling. He and his spouse continued to play in their son-in-law's theatre until the 1780s.

The show was held near the second anniversary of Pe√±a's death from a heart attack. The main focus of the show was the second annual Copa Antonio Pe√±a which was won by El Mesias as he survived a 13-man Gauntlet match defeating Pirata Morgan, El Elegido, Psicosis II, Dark Escoria, Silver King, Crazy Boy and Dark Cuervo one by one to win the Copa. The main event of the show saw La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Electroshock, Konnan, Rellik and Kenzo Suzuki) defeat \\"Team AAA\\" (Latin Lover, Octag√≥n, La Parka and Super Fly). As a result of the win Konnan became the storyline owner of AAA. In the third main event of the evening Cibern√©tico successfully defended the AAA Mega Championship against Chessman and El Zorro. The event has since been retrospectively renamed H√©roes Inmortales II (\\"Immortal Heroes II\\"). Production Background On October 5, 2006 founder of the Mexican professional wrestling, company AAA Antonio Pe√±a died from a heart attack. The following year, on October 7, 2007, Pe√±a's brother-in-law Jorge Roldan who had succeeded Pe√±a as head of AAA held a show in honor of Pe√±a's memory, the first ever Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show (Homenaje a Antonio Pe√±a in Spanish). AAA made the tribute to Pe√±a into a major annual event that would normally take place in October of each year, renaming the show series H√©roes Inmortales (Spanish for \\"Immortal Heroes\\"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as H√©roes Inmortales I and H√©roes Inmortales II. As part of their annual tradition AAA holds a Copa Antonio Pe√±a (\\"Antonio Pe√±a Cup\\") tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for the trophy. The tournament is normally either a gauntlet match or a multi-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. Outside of the actual Copa Antonio Pe√±a trophy the winner is not guaranteed any other \\"prizes\\" as a result of winning, although several Copa Antonio Pe√±a winners did go on to challenge for the AAA Mega Championship. The 2008 show was the second show in what would become known as the H√©roes Inmortales shows. Storylines The Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Undercard matches The first match of the Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show was a six-man Mini-Estrella match that saw the tecnico team of Mascarita Divina, Mini Charly Manson and Octagoncito defeat the rudo team of Mascarita de la Muerte, Mini Chessman and Mini Histeria. The second match on the undercard was a \\"AAA Special\\" Relevos At√≥micos de locura match (Spanish for \\"Eight-man madness match\\") that featured two teams of four: a male wrestler, a female wrestler, an Exotico wrestler and a Mini-Estrella. The added stipulation here was that it was contested under \\"Lumberjack\\" rules, which means that other wrestlers surround the ring and is allowed to throw a wrestler back in the ring if they leave it. The team of Brazo de Plata (male), Faby Apache (female), Mascarita Sagrada (Mini-Estrella) and Pimpinela Escarlata (Exotico) defeated the Rudo team of El Brazo (male), Cinthia Moreno (Female), Mini Abismo Negro (Mini-Estrella) and Polvo de Estrellas (Exotico). The third match on the card was a three way tag team Lucha de Escaleras, or Ladder Match, where La Hermandad Extrema (Spanish for \\"the Extreme Brotherhood\\"; Joe L√≠der and Nicho el Millonario) successfully the defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship against Los Bellos Stones (\\"The beautiful Stones\\"; Alan and Chris Stone) and The Hart Foundation 2.0 (Jack Evans and Teddy Hart). Main event matches The first of the three scheduled main events was the second annual Copa Antonio Pe√±a Gauntlet match. The underlying storyline of the match was El Mes√≠as' struggle with his former teammates in La Secta del Mes√≠as and La Legi√≥n Extranjera after turning tecnico in the preceding month. El Mes√≠as was the seventh participant in the match, with Histeria, Gato Eveready, Extreme Tiger, Pirata Morgan, Aero Star and El Alebrije having already been eliminated. El Mesias stayed in the ring from entrant seven until the final participant, eliminating six wrestlers in total; El Elegido, Psicosis II, Dark Escoria, Silver King, Crazy Boy and Dark Cuervo to win the Copa. After the match Cibern√©tico saved El Mes√≠as from a La Legi√≥n attack, enforcing El Mesias status as a tecnico. In the fifth match of the night Cibern√©tico defended the AAA Mega Championship against former teammate Chessman and La Legi√≥n deputy leader El Zorro in a Three way Street Fight, a match with no rules. The match saw all three wrestlers use various objects such as chairs and tables and also saw interference from La Legi√≥n, drawing blood from all participants. In the end Cibern√©tico retained the title by pinning El Zorro while Chessman was incapacitated from missing a move off the top rope. The last match of the evening was the continuation of the long running \\"AAA vs. La Legi√≥n storyline that had been the main focus of AAA for over two years. The match was a six man Steel cage elimination match where the winning team would win the storyline control of AAA, if \\"Team AAA\\" (Latin Lover, Octag√≥n, La Parka and Super Fly) won Joaquin Roldan, brother-in-law of Antonio Pe√±a would remain in charge of AAA, while if La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Electroshock, Konnan, Kenzo Suzuki and a \\"surprise wrestler\\") won La Legi√≥n leader Konnan would be in charge of AAA. An urn supposedly containing the ashes of Antonio Pe√±a was brought to ringside, symbolizing the control of AAA that was at stake. In order to win the match the entire team had to escape the cage. Konnan introduced Rellik as La Legi√≥n's surprise wrestler, who joined AAA shortly after being fired from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, and announced that if La Legi√≥n won Rellik would be the \\"Keeper of the urn\\". The first to escape was Octag√≥n, quickly followed by Kenzo Suzuki, next La Parka and Electroshock escaped, keeping the two sides even in the cage. Super Fly and Rellik were the next two to leave the cage leaving only Latin Lover and Konnan in the match. La Legi√≥n won the match when Konnan was able to escape due to interference from Solo Para Mujeres TV host Sergio Mayer, who threw what was supposed to be urine at Latin Lover‚Äôs face when he tried to escape the cage. Following the victory Konnan gained possession of the urn to siginify his storyline power over the promotion. Aftermath Following the Memorial show where Konnan took the storyline control of the promotion Cibern√©tico announced that he would not work for Konnan and vacated the AAA Mega Championship. Initially believed to be an elaborate storyline Cibern√©tico then quit AAA and began working on the Mexican independent circuit. Blurring the lines of storyline and real life animosity Cibern√©tico did not work for AAA for 10 months, returning only after Konnan lost the storyline control of AAA at Tripleman√≠a XVII and disbanded La Legi√≥n Extranjera. El Mes√≠as won the vacant AAA Mega Championship at the 2008 Guerra de Titanes and further cemented his status as the top tecnico of the promotion following Cibern√©tico's departure.

The show was held approximately one year after Pe√±a died of a heart attack. The main focus of the show was the first ever Copa Antonio Pe√±a which was won by Charly Manson as he survived a 12-man gauntlet match eliminating Alan Stone, Konnan and Scott Hall to win the Copa. Also on the show was a Domo De La Muerte cage match (Spanish for \\"Dome of Death\\") that saw Chessman come out as the loser in the match and thus had to have his hair shaved off. The undercard featured four additional matches. The show also saw the surprise return of Nicho El Millonario and Electroshock and the surprise appearance of Scott Hall. The event has since been retrospectively renamed H√©roes Inmortales I (\\"Immortal Heroes I\\"). Production Background On October 5, 2006 founder of the Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for \\"Assistance, Consulting, and Administration\\") Antonio Pe√±a died from a heart attack. The following year, on October 7, 2007, Pe√±a's brother-in-law Jorge Roldan who had succeeded Pe√±a as head of AAA held a show in honor of Pe√±a's memory, the first ever Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show (Homenaje a Antonio Pe√±a in Spanish). AAA made the tribute to Pe√±a into a major annual event that would normally take place in October of each year, renaming the show series H√©roes Inmortales (Spanish for \\"Immortal Heroes\\"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as H√©roes Inmortales I and H√©roes Inmortales II. As part of their annual tradition AAA holds a Copa Antonio Pe√±a (\\"Antonio Pe√±a Cup\\") tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for the trophy. The tournament is normally either a gauntlet match or a multi-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. Outside of the actual Copa Antonio Pe√±a trophy the winner is not guaranteed any other \\"prizes\\" as a result of winning, although several Copa Antonio Pe√±a winners did go on to challenge for the AAA Mega Championship. The 2007 show was the first show in what would become known as the H√©roes Inmortales shows. Storylines The Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Undercard matches The first match of the Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show was a six-man Mini-Estrella match that saw the tecnico team of Mascarita Divina, Octag√≥ncito and La Parkita defeat the rudo team Los Mini Vipers (Mini Charly Manson, Mini Chessman and Mini Histeria) in 17:48. The second match on the undercard was a \\"AAA Special\\" Relevos At√≥micos de locura match (Spanish for \\"Eight-man madness match\\") that featured two teams of four: a male wrestler, a female wrestler, an Exotico wrestler and a Mini-Estrella. Billy Boy teamed with his ex-wife Faby Apache, Cassandro and Mini Abismo Negro to defeat the makeshift team of Super Fly, Cinthia Moreno, Pimpinela Escarlata and Mascarita Sagrada when Cassandro pinned Super Fly following a Rana headscissors. After the match a new Exotico group called Las Night Queens, Polvo de Estrellas, Yuriko, Nygma and Jesse, attacking both Casandro and Pimpinela Escarlata. The third match of the night featured the rudo group Los Viper‚Äôs Revolution (Histeria, Mr. Niebla and Psicosis II) taking on and beating a team of \\"AAA Loyalists\\" consisting of El Alebrije, El Elegido and Octag√≥n. Histeria and Psicosis II both pinned El Elegido at the same time, gaining the win for their team. In the fourth match of the night Nicho el Millonario made his surprise return to AAA after years of absence, teaming up with Extreme Tiger and Halloween to reform La Familia de Tijuana, a stable last seen in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. La Familia defeated the Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy, Joe L√≠der and Juventud Guerrera) in a traditional Six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match when Nicho landed a high flying move off the top rope on Juventud Guerrera. Main event matches Chessman, lost his hair in the main event The first of the two main events on the show was the first ever Copa Antonio Pe√±a, a 12-man gauntlet match, where two wrestlers begin in the ring and each time a wrestler is defeated he is replaced by a new wrestler until all 12 wrestlers have entered the match. The focus of the event was the storyline between La Legi√≥n Extranjera (\\"The Foreign Legion\\" in Spanish) and the \\"AAA Loyalists\\". The match started out with La Legi√≥n member X-Pac facing and defeating Brazo de Plata in short order. AAA Loyalist Mascara Divina was the next competitor, eliminating X-Pac after approximately five minutes of action. Next Mascara Divina faced Legi√≥naire Kenzo Suzuki who made short work of Divina, eliminating him after only a couple of minutes of wrestling. Next Kenzo Suzuki eliminated AAA Icon La Parka, taking advantage of La Parka's shoulder injury. AAA wrestler Laredo Kid surprisingly pinned Suzuki next, giving the young wrestlers one of his biggest wins to date. Unfortunately Laredo Kid suffered a serious leg injury while executing a move on Ron Killings and was eliminated from the match. The injury kept Laredo Kid out of the ring for months. The seventh competitor was Alan Stone, rolling up Ron Killings to eliminate him, only to face his main storyline rival Scorpio, Jr. as the next entrant. Scorpio, Jr. soon got help from his Los Guapos team mates Zumbido and Decnis but Alan Stone still managed to pin Scorpio, Jr. After the loss all three Guapos' attacked Alan Stone, drawing blood. The next competitor was Charly Manson, a member of the very popular Los Hell Brothers faction, who pinned Alan Stone after nine minutes of wrestling. The next competitor was the surprise appearance of Scott Hall, brought in by La Legi√≥n as their secret weapon. Konnan, the leader of La Legi√≥n made his surprise return as well, recovered from a kidney operation he accompanied Scott Hall to ringside. Manson overcame interference from Konnan, X-Pac and Ron Killings to pin Scott Hall. Just as Charly Manson thought he had won the gauntlet match Konnan attacked him from behind, revealing that he was the final competitor. In the end La Parka came to the ring, thwarting La Legi√≥n's plans, helping Charly Manson pin Konnan and win the first Copa Antonio Pe√±a. Following the match Charly Manson was presented with a medal, bearing the image of Antonio Pe√±a, by Joaquin Roldan, Pe√±a's successor as AAA booker. The second main event, and last match of the evening was a Domo De La Muerte cage match where the last man in the ring would be forced to have his hair shaved off. The tecnico team saw Los Hell Brothers (Chessman and Cibern√©tico) team up with and El Intocable who replaced Latin Lover in the match. La Legi√≥n Extranjera came to the ring next, scheduled to compete were AAA Mega Champion El Mes√≠as, Abismo Negro and El Zorro. Before the match began El Mes√≠as announced that he was injured and that La Legi√≥n had brought someone in to replace him in the match and then introduced the returning Electroshock as his replacement. El Zorro was the first to escape the cage, followed by Cibern√©tico less than a minute later. Following Cibern√©tico's escape El Zorro climbed back inside the cage to give his side a three on two advantage against Intocable and Chessman. With the numbers to their advantage La Legi√≥n were able to be so dominant that both Electroshock and Abismo Negro were able to escape pretty close together. Intocable escaped next as Zorro was fighting with Chessman. After 18 minutes of action El Zorro managed to climb up the cage and out, leaving Chessman the last man in the ring. After the match Chessman had his hair shaved off in the middle of the ring.

He was the brother of Juan Goytisolo and Luis Goytisolo, also writers.  Biography  Born in Barcelona on 13 April 1928, in an upper class Spanish-only speaking family (that is, not Catalan- speaking), his family was brutally shaken by the death of his mother (Julia Gay) in a Nationalist bombardment in 1938. Jos√© Agust√≠n was specially affected, and named his daughter after his lost mother. In Words for Julia, one of his best-known poems (sung by Paco Ib√°√±ez and Los Suaves, among others), he joins the love for both women. In 1993, in the Elegies to Julia Gay, he united all his mother-themed poems. He also deals with his feelings toward his mother in his later books The return (1955) and End of a goodbye (1984). He started studying Law in the University of Barcelona, and ended his studies in Madrid. He was a member of the so-called \\"Generation of the 50s\\", along with writers such as √Ångel Gonz√°lez, Jos√© Manuel Caballero, Jos√© √Ångel Valente and Jaime Gil de Biedma. They shared a moral or politic commitment and a renewed attention to the lyrics and the language. According to Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n, Goytisolo's poetry was not just an ideological substitute for the capitalism of Francoist Spain, but aspired to build a new humanism:  Works  *El retorno 1955 *Salmos al viento 1956 *Claridad 1959 *A√±os decisivos 1961 *Algo sucede 1968 *Bajo tolerancia 1973 *Taller de Arquitectura 1976 *Del tiempo y del olvido 1977 *Palabras para Julia 1979 *Los pasos del cazador 1980 *A veces gran amor 1981 *Sobre las circunstancias 1983 *Final de un adi√≥s 1984 *Como los trenes de la noche 1994 *Cuadernos de El Escorial 1995 *Eleg√≠as a Julia Gay 1993  Anthologies  * Poetas catalanes contempor√°neos 1968 * Poes√≠a cubana de la Revoluci√≥n 1970 * Antolog√≠a de Jos√© Lezama Lima * Antolog√≠a de Jorge Luis Borges * Los poemas son mi orgullo, poetic anthology.

The originally independent company was founded at the beginning of the 20th century in the area of Stuttgart (South Germany). Until its insolvency in 1995, the Moto Meter AG was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.J√ºrgen H. Wintermann: Abschied vom Kurszettel. In: ‚ÄûDie Welt‚Äú vom 17. November 1995.

Some of the instruments developed at the beginnings of Motometer's traditional history can still be found in workshops today, such as the Recording Compression Tester or the Tyre Pressure Tester. In 1925 the Moto- Meter-GmbH (Frankfurt a.M.) was mentioned in business documents for the first time.

Probably the first Bah√° º√≠ to settle in the country came in early 1934 and with further pioneers by mid-1934, the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was elected in November in Addis Ababa. In 1962, Ethiopia Bah√° º√≠s had elected a National Spiritual Assembly. By 1963 there were seven localities with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated some 27000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. The community celebrated its diamond jubilee in January 2009.  Beginnings    ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan   ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"‚Ä¶especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" ‚Ä¶the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration‚Ä¶.\\"  Establishment of the community  Early pioneers from Egypt gathered in Addis Ababa (see Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Egypt.) The first to arrive was Sabri Elias in early 1934 who thus earned the title Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. By mid-1934 he was joined by families of Bah√° º√≠s and in late 1934 they elected the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly. Its members were: Atto Sium Gabril, Atto Haila Gabril, Habib Boutros, Sabri Elias, Edouard Goubran, El-Saad Said, El- Saad Mansour, Abdu'llahi Ahmed, and Aurahil Egsabaihir. Sabri Elias traveled back and forth from Alexandria devoted to the work of translating and printing various materials including Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era in Amharic though he had to leave in 1935 and was able to return next in 1944 (having taken the opportunity to get married and undertake pilgrimage) due to the Second Italo- Abyssinian War. The members of the community had left and the assembly was next elected in 1945. In 1947 Ugo Giachery rendered some assistance translating materials for the community to use. In early 1951 the Ethiopian community sent its first pioneer beyond Addis Ababa. Followed by Mr. and Mrs. Elias who left for Djibouti in 1954. At the same time across the regional unit of Egypt and Abyssinia women were allowed to be and were elected according to the rules of Bah√° º√≠ administration to be members of assemblies including in Addis Ababa - members were: Mr G.M. Bahta Mrs Gila, Dr V. Kies, Sabri Elias, Mrs Sabri, Mr Alfred Shafi, Mr Birch, Sayed Mansour, and David A. Talbot. In 1952 some were elected officers - the members were Gila M. Bahta, David Talbot, Dr. V. Ries, Sabri Elias, Mrs. Gila (treasurer) Mrs. Elias Alfred Shafi, Mr. Birch Sayed Mansour.  Growth  The Bah√° º√≠ Community in Ethiopia came under the responsibility of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of Egypt and Sudan during the Ten Year Crusade in 1953. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. Pioneers continued to arrive like Fred Schechter in 1954 and Dr. Am√≠n'u'll√°h Misb√°h who lived there from 1955‚Äì1959. Bah√° º√≠ Holy days and Bah√° º√≠ Marriage certificates were recognized in Addis Ababa, and the assembly obtained legal incorporation in 1955‚Äì56. The community subsequently became part of the regional National Assembly of North-East Africa in 1956. A summer school in 1958 was held in Eritrea, then part of Ethiopia, hosting a significant expansion of the effort which included Bah√° º√≠s from several cities: Addis Ababa, Gondar, Adiqualla, Massawa, Agordat, Barentu, and Asmara. The program included a variety of subjects: \\"Baha'i Administration\\" by Charles Hassan of Addis Ababa, \\"Baha'i History\\" by Dr. Hushang Ahdieh of Asmara, \\"Islam\\" by Mrs. Jeanne Mesbah of Asmara, \\"The Laws and Ordinances of Baha'u'llah\\" by Dr. Farhoumand, and \\"Meditatinn\\" by Dr. Walter Niederreiter. The Bah√° º√≠s were allowed to send official observers to the first session of the Economic Commission for Africa of the United Nations held in Addis Ababa in late 1958: Gila Bahta and Charles Hassan of Addis Ababa, and Ali Nakhjavani of Kampala. They succeeded in meeting and discussing the religion with representatives to the Commission and discussing a variety of issues including the Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran. The first Bah√° º√≠ summer school in Addis Ababa was held in May 1959 and included an observance of the 12th Day of Ridv√°n. The average attendance during the school sessions was twenty-five, and included many Bah√° º√≠s of Addis Ababa and their non-Bah√° º√≠ friends. In 1960 a group of sixty-five, half of them guests of the Baha'is shown considerable interest in an introductory talk on the religion in Addis Ababa in the Amharic language. In 1961 events began to multiply - members of the religion reached the towns of Volisso, Bedele and Shashamane, participated in the dedication of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Uganda. and the assembly of Addis Ababa oversaw the first Bah√° º√≠ marriage. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga travelled extensively in East Africa in 1962 including Ethiopia by which time Ethiopia Bah√° º√≠s had elected a National Spiritual Assembly. The same year a Bah√° º√≠ Ethiopian student studying in Germany was elected president of the non-partisan Ethiopian Student Union. By 1963 in addition to the assembly in Addis Ababa there were seven communities with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in Adua, Alemaya, Debre Zeyit, Dessie, Dire Dawa, Gondar & Jimma and twelve isolated members in other communities. And also in 1963 in a step of recognition of the religion the city government of Addis Ababa allocated land for use as a Bah√° º√≠ burial ground.  Regional organization  The Sudan/Egypt regional National Assembly existed until 1953 when it became a regional assembly for North East Africa. This included French Somaliland; Egypt, Sudan, Abyssinia, Libya, Eritrea, British Somaliland; Italian Somaliland; and Socotra Is. The regional assembly was again re-organized when the institutions of the religion were made illegal in Egypt in 1960 and again when Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia formed their own regional assembly in 1968 with members: Gila Michael Bahta, Dr. Leo Neiderreitter, Gamal Rushdy, Asfaw Tessema, Dr. Heshmat Farhoumand, Dr. Hushang Ahdieh, Ursula Samandari, Assefaw Habte Michael and Rabbi Teele Mariam. From 1968 into 69 there were a number of initiatives undertaken including reaching to outlying areas, international speakers and a winter school.  Visit of Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum  From 1969 to 1973 Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum travelled through many countries including Ethiopia. She arrived in Ethiopia October 15 and spent a month touring the Bah√° º√≠ communities with coverage by print and, for the first time in Ethiopia radio, news outlets on her arrival. She was received by Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia the same day. In the half-hour interview she communicated how she had long admired him because of the way he had conducted himself in the face of the many trials and hardships of his life, and by the way he had overcome them. Selassie gave her a gold medal from his Coronation. In the days afterwards she was escorted by civic authorities to Genet where a regional conference was held, in part to celebrate the Bah√° º√≠ holy day of the Birth of the B√°b, and dedicated the Ban√°ni Teaching Institute. Villagers surprised the guests with a dance they had not shared previously and sung Bah√° º√≠ songs with English words - a language foreign to them - with clarity enough to be understood. At a stop in another village a couple local Muslim leaders converted to the religion in her presence. On return to Addis Ababa R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum and some Ethiopian Bah√° º√≠s were received by Princess Tenagnework Worke Haile Selassie and her daughter Princess Seble Desta. The following day the Bah√° º√≠ community sponsored an observance of United Nations Day with a public lecture by a member of the United Nations Secretariat stationed in Ethiopia, prefaced by remarks by R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum who was able to first present the Bah√° º√≠ attitude toward, and relationship with, the United Nations. The following day she flew to the Province of Harrari where she was received by the provincial governor, though she fell ill and a member of the national assembly flew her to Assab to recoup. Then in Eritrea she addressed audiences of government servants, school principals and teachers, and a women's organization on topics of science and religion, the place of a religious morality and the civilizing role of women, often with questions from the audiences often late into the night. Later, in discussion with Prince Asrate Medhin Kassa it became known that while in exhile some years earlier he had borrowed and read a copy of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era in Amharic that had been given to the Emperor. R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum then toured ancient sites of Ethiopia, Axum and Lalibela. Then she went to Gondar where Bah√° º√≠s had recently been attacked and then detained in circumstances soon implicating a local priest. The uproar over the event was such that another priest and several others converted to the religion. On return to Addis Ababa the Israeli Ambassador held a formal dinner in her honor. The next three nights she spoke to Bah√° º√≠ audiences and then celebrated the Bah√° º√≠ holy day of the Birth of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the trip to see the Bah√° º√≠s of Sebeta. On the last return to Addis Ababa Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen received her then she resumed her tour of Africa by going next to Kenya.  Modern community  Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern. That involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics even then. In 1970 representatives from seven National Spiritual Assemblies in Africa and from the Bah√° º√≠ International Community were the largest delegation to the first African Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Of the 104 Non-Governmental Organization delegates and observers attending - representing seventy-four organizations from twenty countries in Africa- ten were Baha'is; and two Bah√° º√≠ representatives were the only participants from Mauritius and Swaziland. With background work in New York, preparatory work in Addis Ababa, and large participation by Bah√° º√≠s, they received praise for their efforts and dependability by the NGO liaison representative of the Ethiopian government and by other UN personnel. A senior officer for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa was the speaker at the gathering sponsored by the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Africa in Asmara late in 1973 to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He spoke at length about the role of the Bah√° º√≠s and like-minded organizations. He repeated his sentiments in 1980. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.The modern Bah√° º√≠ community of Ethiopia has multiplied its interests internally and externally along these lines.  Growth  In 1969 there was one assembly in the Sidamo Province of south central Ethiopia, 18 in 1972 and 59 in 1974. In 1975 a total of seventy Local Spiritual Assemblies formed. A cultural clash in choosing leadership happened under such quick growth. People of Sidamo were used to an open atmosphere when choosing their leaders and had difficulty adjusting to secret ballot as normal in Bah√° º√≠ electoral process. Nevertheless, the elections went forward and materials and classes were held covering the issues though human resources were thin under such rapid growth. Observers concluded that in 1975 things had gone well. In 1978 the Nure community organized and managed a local conference, and believers from other villages chaired the sessions. Succeeding local conferences were to be held in villages of Mudane and Dereba. In northern Ethiopia fighting had broken out. At one meeting Bah√° º√≠s were inundated by refugee neighbors in an apartment building from shots fired. When the police arrived the Bah√° º√≠s were vindicated from fears of cooperation in the attack when the chief of police discovered Bah√° º√≠s were involved. He summoned his aides to help the wounded, apologetically made a purely ceremonial inspection of the house, and let them go, explaining that there was no need to investigate the Bah√° º√≠s, that he knew the Bah√° º√≠s were not a source of danger and he entertained no doubts about them. There are other stories of activities of small groups of Bah√° º√≠s. In 1976 the first Baha'i newsletter in the Amharic language began publication. Sabri Elias, founder of the community in Ethiopia, and his wife, returned in 1977 for the national convention before flying on back to Djibouti. Forty-two Bah√° º√≠s from Ethiopia attended a regional conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008 held in Johannesburg. The North American Temple Bah√° º√≠ choir went to Addis Ababa in January 2009 for the 75th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Ethiopia and sang at Holy Trinity Cathedral of Ethiopia, the Ethiopian National Museum and the Ethiopian National Theatre. Members of the choir flew in from U.S., Canada, Australia and Africa. Speakers at the diamond jubilee included Ali Nakhjavani and his wife Violette Nakhjavani.  International peace  In the 1990s a Racism Dance was translated by an Ethiopian Bah√° º√≠ Youth Workshop (see Oscar DeGruy) which addressed racial, national/ethnic prejudices and was used to talk about war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. There was a 2007 Ethiopian-Eritrean Bah√° º√≠ Conference held in the United States.  Education  Among the Bah√° º√≠ teachings is the importance of education. In 1980 the National Assembly of Auxiliary Board consulted on a project for the International Year of the Child. They developed the project \\"Ha Hu in Nine Days,\\" which was designed to help an illiterate person learn the Amharic alphabet in only nine days. It was presented to UNESCO representative in Ethiopia and liaison officer for the UN Economic Commission for Africa followed by the Minister of Education and chairman of the National Commission for IYC. Each meeting had a reporter from the English-language newspaper, The Ethiopian Herald. An experimental garden was set up in Sidamo Province as a demonstration field in the compound of the regional center to train Bah√° º√≠ farmers in improved agricultural techniques. In 1989 a Bah√° º√≠ expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Ethiopia training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. Dr. Fisseha Eshetu, the President of Unity University, a Bah√° º√≠ inspired school, received a \\"Global Young Entrepreneur\\" award at the 7th World Summit of Young Entrepreneurs in 2000 after founding the institution in 1991. In 2001 Eshetu has taken positions on the development of the internet in Ethiopia. Unity University was the first private institution of higher education to open in Ethiopia, and as of 2001 the journalism program was the only university-level independent journalism program in the country. \\"Tsehai Loves Learning\\" is a television show of a hand puppet in the Amharic language. There are about 45 local children's classes being offered currently by Bah√° º√≠ communities in Ethiopia \\\\- more prominent schools are the School of the Nations of Ethiopia and One Planet International School.  Demographics  The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 26,581 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

Tom Frost and I had made the second ascent of this route, mostly with direct aid in the early sixties. That one could climb this route without resorting to direct aid was impressive. To do it without a rope was astonishing. But such was Peter's level of mastery. That it was mastery, and not mere daring was proven by a string of free solos of similar stature, executed to perfection.\\" FROSTWORKS - Environmental Commentaries - Standing on the Shoulders: A Tribute to my Heroes By Royal Robbins (retrieved October 10, 2009) Early life Croft was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia on May 18, 1958. He grew up in Departure Bay, British Columbia where he was introduced to climbing. Speaking with Peter in the early 2000s at Joshua Tree, he was asked what got him into free solo climbing. Peter said he was so drawn to climbing that at the end of the day when his other buddies were done and into campfire activities, he needed more. With no partner it evolved into free solo climbing.

It was established in 1991 by Richard Berman, and has been described as \\"a nonprofit research group that studies issues of entry-level employment.\\" Employment Policies Institute does not have its own employees or office, but rather its staff work for Berman and Company, which is a public affairs firm owned by Richard Berman, who lobbies for the restaurant, hotel, alcoholic beverage and tobacco industries. The charity evaluator Charity Navigator has issued a donor advisory concerning The Employment Policies Institute.http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid;=13373 Employment Policies Institute should not be confused with the older, similarly named Economic Policy Institute, which is a liberal think tank advocating for low to moderate-income families in the United States. Issues The Employment Policies Institute has released a number of studies that look at the economic effects of policies (like the minimum wage, health care mandates, and employment tax credits) on low-wage labor markets. It also regularly analyzes job market data in the United States Typically, studies are contracted by university economists and published under its name. In 2009, The Employment Policies Institute launched a campaign, Defeat The Debt, focusing on the national debt. Minimum wage The Employment Policies Institute argues that increases to the minimum wage also increase unemployment among groups of workers like teens and less-educated and unskilled workers. Economists have varied views on the impact of minimum wage laws. It weighed in when David Card and Alan Krueger concluded that a 1992 minimum wage hike in New Jersey did not decrease employment in the state. Card and Krueger surveyed fast food employers in New Jersey before and after an April 1992 increase in the state minimum wage (from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour) and found a slight increase in employment.Minimum wage#Card and Krueger Critics of the analysis, including The Employment Policies Institute, noted that because Card and Krueger's research was based on informal headcounts acquired through telephone surveys, it could not be easily replicated. Subsequent analysis of these restaurants' payroll data records found that employment actually decreased by 4.6 percent after the minimum wage hike, and The Employment Policies Institute's findings were later verified by independent economists. This result would mean that the total amount of wages paid to minimum wage employees in the fast food industry in New Jersey increased 13.4 percent as a result of the increase in the minimum wage (employment declined 4.6 percent, but the minimum wage increased 18.8 percent, for a total change in wages paid of 13.4 percent). In 2000, Card and Krueger redid their study using a data set from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and reproduced their earlier conclusions. They also showed that Neumark and Wascher's results were due to a non-random biased sample of restaurants. In the time since the Card‚ÄìKrueger study was released, many economists have tried to look at the effects of minimum wage increases on employment prospects. A 2006 review by Neumark and Wascher of over 100 studies on the minimum wage concluded that the general consensus view agreed that wage increases hurt employment opportunities for youths. Staff and Management Michael Saltsman has been identified on a number of occasions as The Employment Policies Institute research director.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/insight/2014/02/16/industries- unions-fund-nonprofits-studies-to-aid-lobbying.html Samantha Summers is the nonprofits communications director.

In the late 15th century it was again rebuilt into a small manor and in 1510 sold to the house of Auersperg, which in 1581 sold it to the nobleman Johann Engelshauser. In 1717, Pope Clement XI authorized the opening of a private oratory at the castle. In 1805, the castle was inherited by a relative of the counts Engelshauser, Count Wilhelm Weikhard Auersperg. The castle was the target of peasant revolts in 1515 and 1848, and was besieged by the Turks in 1528. During World War II, it served as an outpost for Italian carabinieri and Slovene Village Guard forces. In 1944, it was attacked and burned down by Partisans.Verbiƒç, ≈†pela. 2012.

Traditionally, Paul the Apostle was thought to be the author. However, since the third century this has been questioned, and the consensus among most modern scholars is that the author is unknown.Alan C. Mitchell, Hebrews (Liturgical Press, 2007) page 6. Ancient views The Epistle to the Hebrews was included in the collected writings of Paul from a very early date. For example, the late second-century or early third-century codex \\\\mathfrak{P}46, a volume of Paul's general epistles, includes Hebrews immediately after Romans. While the assumption of Pauline authorship readily allowed its acceptance in the Eastern Church, doubts persisted in the West.Alan C. Mitchell, Hebrews (Liturgical Press, 2007) page 2. Eusebius does not list Epistle to the Hebrews among the antilegomena or disputed books (though he included the unrelated Gospel of the Hebrews).Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.25.5 (text). He does record, however, that \\"some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul.\\"Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.3.5 (text); cf. also 6.20.3 (text). In response, he endorses the view of Clement of Alexandria: that the epistle was written by Paul in Hebrew (unsigned through modesty), and \\"translated carefully\\" into Greek by Luke,Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 6.14.2‚Äì3 (text), citing Clement's Hypotyposes, a thing demonstrated by its stylistic similarity with Luke's Acts. Doubts about Pauline authorship were raised around the end of the second century, predominantly in the West. Tertullian attributed the epistle to Barnabas.De Pudic. 20 (text). Both Gaius of RomeEusebius, Hist. Eccl. 6.20.3 (text). and HippolytusPhotius, Bibl. 121. excluded Hebrews from the works of Paul, the latter attributing it to Clement of Rome.Bar ·π¢alƒ´bƒ´, In Apoc. 1.4. Origen noted that others had claimed Clement or Luke as the author, but he tentatively accepted Pauline origin of the thought in the text and the explanation of Clement of Alexandria, saying that \\"the thoughts are those of the apostle, but the diction and phraseology are those of some one who remembered the apostolic teachings, and wrote down at his leisure what had been said by his teacher\\", as quoted by Eusebius.Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 6.25.11‚Äì14 (text). Jerome, aware of such lingering doubts,Jerome, Ad Dardanum 129.3. included the epistle in his Vulgate but moved it to the end of Paul's writings. Augustine affirmed Paul's authorship and vigorously defended the epistle. By then its acceptance in the New Testament canon was well settled. Modern views  In general, the evidence against Pauline authorship is considered too solid for scholarly dispute. Donald Guthrie, in his New Testament Introduction (1976), commented that \\"most modern writers find more difficulty in imagining how this Epistle was ever attributed to Paul than in disposing of the theory.\\"p. 671 Harold Attridge tells us that \\"it is certainly not a work of the apostle\\".Peter Kirby, EarlyChristianWritings.com Daniel Wallace, who holds to the traditional authorship of the other epistles, states that \\"the arguments against Pauline authorship, however, are conclusive.\\"\\"Hebrews: Introduction, Argument and Outline\\", Daniel Wallace As a result, although a few people today believe Paul wrote Hebrews, such as theologian R.C. Sproul,R.C. Sproul - The Supremacy of Christ - Ligonier.org. Retrieved 22 September 2014. contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.Ehrman 2004:411 As Richard Heard notes, in his Introduction to the New Testament, \\"modern critics have confirmed that the epistle cannot be attributed to Paul and have for the most part agreed with Origen's judgement, 'But as to who wrote the epistle, only God knows the truth.'\\"Religion-online.org , Richard Heard, Introduction To The New Testament Attridge argues that similarities with Paul's work are simply a product of a shared usage of traditional concepts and language. Others, however, have suggested that they are not accidental, and that the work is a deliberate forgery attempting to pass itself off as a work of Paul.Bart D. Ehrman, Forged: Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are (HarperCollins, 2011) page 23. Internal evidence Internal anonymity The text as it has been passed down to the present time is internally anonymous, though some older title headings attribute it to the Apostle Paul. Stylistic differences from Paul The style is notably different from the rest of Paul's epistles, a characteristic noted by Clement of Alexandria (c. 210), who argued, according to Eusebius, that the original letter had a Hebrew audience and so was written in Hebrew and later translated into Greek, \\"some say [by] the evangelist Luke, others... [by] Clement [of Rome]... The second suggestion is more convincing, in view of the similarity of phraseology shown throughout by the Epistle of Clement and the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in absence of any great difference between the two works in the underlying thought.\\" He concluded that \\"as a result of this translation, the same complexion of style is found in this Epistle and in the Acts: but that the 'Paul an apostle' were naturally not prefixed. For, he says, 'in writing to Hebrews who had conceived a prejudice against him and were suspicious of him, he very wisely did not repel them at the beginning by putting his name.'\\" This stylistic difference has led Martin Luther and Lutheran churches to refer to Hebrews as one of the antilegomena, one of the books whose authenticity and usefulness was questioned. As a result, it is placed with James, Jude, and Revelation, at the end of Luther's canon. Stylistic similarities to Paul Some theologians and groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, who continue to maintain Pauline authorship, repeat the opinion of Eusebius that Paul omitted his name because he, the Apostle to the Gentiles, was writing to the Jews. They conjecture that Jews would have likely dismissed the letter if they had known Paul to be the source. They theorize that the stylistic differences from Paul‚Äôs other letters are attributed to his writing in Hebrew to the Hebrews, and that the letter was translated into Greek by Luke. In the 13th chapter of Hebrews, Timothy is referred to as a companion. Timothy was Paul's missionary companion in the same way Jesus sent disciples out in pairs. Also, the writer states that he wrote the letter from \\"Italy\\", which also at the time fits Paul.to the Letter to the Hebrews\\". Accessed 17 Mar 2013. The difference in style is explained as simply an adjustment to a more specific audience, to the Jewish Christians who were being persecuted and pressured to go back to old Judaism.Hahn, Roger. \\"The Book of Hebrews\\". Christian Resource Institute. Accessed 17 Mar 2013Epistle to the Hebrews. Biblical Training. 23 September 2014. The epistle contains Paul's classic closing greeting, \\"Grace‚Ä¶ be with you‚Ä¶\\" as he stated explicitly in and as implied in and . This closing greeting is included at the end of each of Paul's letters. Although the writing style varies from Paul in a number of ways, some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline epistles have been noted. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.Attridge, Harold W.: Hebrews. Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1989, pp. 1‚Äì6. Other possible authors  Priscilla In more recent times, some scholars have advanced a case for Priscilla having been the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. This suggestion came from Adolf von Harnack in 1900. Harnack claimed that the Epistle was \\"written to Rome‚Äînot to the church, but to the inner circle\\"; that the earliest tradition 'blotted out' the name of the author; that \\"we must look for a person who was intimately associated with Paul and Timothy, as the author\\" and that Priscilla matched this description.von Harnack, Adolph, \\"Probabilia uber die Addresse und den Verfasser des Habraerbriefes\\". Zeitschrift fur die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft und die Kunde der aelteren Kirche (E. Preuschen, Berlin: Forschungen und Fortschritte, 1900), 1:16‚Äì41. English translation available in Lee Anna Starr, The Bible Status of Woman. Zarephath, NJ: Pillar of Fire, 1955), 392‚Äì415. Ruth Hoppin provides considerable support for her conviction that Priscilla had written the Epistle to the Hebrews.Hoppin, Ruth. Priscilla's Letter: Finding the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Lost Coast Press (2009). 978-1-88289750-6. She maintains that Priscilla \\"meets every qualification, matches every clue, and looms ubiquitous in every line of investigation\\". She suggests that the masculine participle may have been altered by a scribe, or that the author was deliberately using a neutral participle \\"as a kind of abstraction\\".Ruth Hoppin, \\"The Epistle to the Hebrews is Priscilla's Letter\\" in Amy-Jill Levine, Maria Mayo Robins (eds), A Feminist Companion to the Catholic Epistles and Hebrews, (A&C; Black, 2004) pages 147‚Äì70. Barnabas Tertullian (On Modesty 20) suggested Barnabas as the author: \\"For there is extant withal an Epistle to the Hebrews under the name of Barnabas‚Äîa man sufficiently accredited by God, as being one whom Paul has stationed next to himself‚Ä¶\\". Internal considerations suggest the author was male, was an acquaintance of Timothy, and was located in Italy. Barnabas, to whom some noncanonical works have been attributed (such as Epistle of Barnabas), was close to Paul in his ministry. Luke, Clement, Apollos Other possible authors were suggested as early as the third century CE. Origen of Alexandria (c. 240) suggested either Luke the Evangelist or Clement of Rome.Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 6.25.11-14 (text) Martin Luther proposed Apollos, described as an Alexandrian and \\"a learned man\\", popular in Corinth, and adept at using the scriptures and arguing for Christianity while \\"refuting the Jews\\".

') is any one of the many imperial dynasties centred in Iran (Persia) from the 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Empire, to the 20th century, the Pahlavi dynasty.  History  Achaemenids The first dynasty of the Persian Empire was created by the Achaemenids, established by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC with the conquest of the Median, Lydian and Babylonian empires. It covered much of the then known Ancient world. Persepolis, the most famous historical site related to Persian Empire in the Achaemenid era, has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. Sasanians From 247 BC to 224 AD, Persia was ruled by the Parthian Empire, which supplanted the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, and then by the Sassanian Empire, which ruled up until the mid-7th century. The Persian Empire in the Sasanian era was interrupted by the Arab conquest of Persia in 651 AD, establishing the even larger Islamic caliphate, and later by the Mongol invasion. The main religion of ancient Persia was the native Zoroastrianism, but after the seventh century, it was slowly replaced by Islam. Safavids Abbas the Great, the most powerful king of the Safavid dynasty The Safavid Empire of 1501 to 1736 was the greatest Iranian Empire established after the 7th-century Muslim conquest of Persia. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavid Persians established control over parts of Greater Persia/Iran and reasserted the Persian identity of the region, becoming the first native Persian dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a unified Persian state. Literature, art and architecture flourished in the Safavid era, which is often cited as the \\"rebirth of the Persian Empire\\". The Safavids also declared Shia Islam the official religion in their empire - as opposed to the Sunni Islam predominant in the neighbouring Ottoman Empire. The Safavid Empire became the first Muslim Iranian state to rival in importance the Ottomans in Turkey (14th to 20th centuries) and the Mameluks in Egypt (1250-1517).  Afshars  The Afsharid dynasty was an Iranian dynasty that originated in Khorasan from the Afshar tribe. The dynasty was founded by Nader Shah. Nader rose to power during a period of chaos in Iran after a rebellion by the Hotaki Pashtuns had overthrown the weak Sultan Husayn, while the arch-enemy of the Safavids, the Ottomans, as well as the Russians had seized Iranian territory for themselves. Nader reunited the Iranian realm and removed the invaders. He became so powerful that he decided to depose the last members of the Safavid dynasty, which had ruled Iran for over 200 years, and become Shah himself in 1736. The Afsharids ruled Iran from 1736 to 1796.  Zands  The Zand dynasty was an Iranian dynasty of Lak a branch of LursMuhammad Karim Khan, of the Zand clan of the Lur tribe, suc- ceeded in imposing his authority on parts of the defunct Safavid empire, David Yeroushalmi, The Jews of Iran in The Nineteenth Century: Aspects of History, Community, and Culture, Brill 2009, , p. xxxix. origin founded by Karim Khan Zand that initially ruled southern and central Iran in the 18th century. It later quickly came to expand to include much of the rest of contemporary Iran, as well as Azerbaijan, Bahrain, and parts of Iraq and Armenia.  Qajars  In 1796, after the fall of the Zand and Afsharid dynasties, Agha Mohammad Khan of Qajar dynasty was the sole ruler of Iran. But soon after, in 1797, he was assassinated by his servants. Since he had no children, the shah was succeeded by his nephew, Fath-Ali Shah. The reign of Fath-Ali Shah saw huge and irrecoverable territorial loss for the Persian Empire after wars against the Russians in 1804‚Äì13 and 1826‚Äì28., page 728 Fath-Ali died in 1834 and was succeeded by his grandson, Mohammad Shah. During his short reign, Mohammad Shah tried to modernize the Iranian army and recapture Herat. However, his attempts were unsuccessful. He died at the age of 40 in Mohammadieh Palace in 1848. After the death of Mohammad Shah, his son, Naser al-Din Shah, ascended to the Sun Throne. He ruled for 50 years, and became the third longest reigning monarch in Iranian history after Shapur II and Tahmasp I. Many events took place during his long reign, including wars with the British Empire, the rebellion of Babis, the assassination of Amir Kabir, and the Tobacco Protest. After the assassination of Naser al-Din Shah, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah ascened to the throne. The first Iranian revolution, the Constitutional Revolution, took place during his reign.Soltan Ali Mirza Kadjar, 'Mohammad Ali Shah: The Man and the King', in: Qajar Studies. Travellers and Diplomats in the Qajar Era. Journal of the International Qajar Studies Association, volume VII, 2007. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah was the last shah who died in Iran. Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar succeeded his father in 1907. He dissolved the parliament and declared the Constitution abolished pp. 285‚Äì286 and bombarded the Majlis. However, he abdicated after the Triumph of Tehran by pro-Constitution forces and re-establishment of the constitution.Soltan Ali Mirza Kadjar, 'Mohammad Ali Shah: The Man and the King', in: Qajar Studies. Travellers and Diplomats in the Qajar Era. Journal of the International Qajar Studies Association, volume VII, 2007. Following the abdication of the shah in 1909, the Majlis placed his 6-years-old son, Ahmad Shah on the Iranian throne.History of Iran: Qajar Dynasty World War I took place during his reign and Iran declared neutrality. However, it didn't stop the British forces and they occupied many parts of Iran, which caused the Great famine of 1917‚Äì1919 and death of 2 million Iranians.: \\"A contemporary Iranian historian recently made the wild accusation that British food exactions to feed its army of occupation during World War I resulted in 10 million dead‚Äîhalf the population. He accuses the British government of \\"covering up\\" this \\"genocide\\" by systematically destroying annual reports. In fact, no annual reports on Iran were written from 1913 until 1922; the British expeditionary force of some 15,000 would not have required that much grain; and although as many as 2 million may have lost their lives in these years, the vast majority died not because of food exactions but from cholera and typhus epidemics, from a series of bad harvests, and, most important of all, from the worldwide 1919‚Äì20 influenza pandemic.\\": \\"Russian Revolution of 1917 brought much relief to Iran after a century of imperial interference and intimidation. But it was followed by severe famine and the Spanish flu pandemic which, combined, took a high toll of around two million, mostly of the Iranian poor.\\": \\"Despite Iran's official neutrality, this pattern of interference continued during World War I as Ottoman-, Russian-, British-, and German-supported local forces fought across Iran, wreaking enormous havoc on the country. With farmland, crops, livestock, and infrastructure destroyed, as many as 2 million Iranians died of famine at the war's end. Although the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the recall of Russian troops, and thus gave hope to Iranians that the foreign yoke might be relenting, the British quickly moved to fill the vacuum in the north, and by 1918, had turned the country into an unofficial protectorate.\\" With the 1921 Persian coup d'√©tat, Reza Pahlavi took control of the country. Ahmad Shah left Iran for health reasons In 1923 and with the official end of the Qajar dynasty in 1925 and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty, his tour became an exile. He died in 1930 in Paris.  Pahlavis  The Pahlavi dynasty was the last ruling house of the Imperial State of Iran from 1925 until 1979, when the Persian monarchy was overthrown and abolished as a result of the Iranian Revolution. The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the Allies after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.

It is a yellow solid that is soluble in organic solvents. It is an important intermediate for the industrial production of other compounds. DNCB is produced commercially by the nitration of p-nitrochlorobenzene with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. Other methods afford the compound less efficiently include the chlorination of dinitrobenzene, nitration of o-nitrochlorobenzene and the dinitration of chlorobenzene. Uses By virtue of the two nitro groups, the chloride is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution. In this way, the compound is a precursor to many other compounds. Base gives the dinitrophenol, ammonia the dinitroaniline, methoxide the dinitroanisole, and amines the secondary amines. Laboratory use DNCB is used as a substrate in GST enzyme activity assays. The molecule is conjugated to a single molecule of reduced glutathione which then absorbs at 340 nm. Affinity of CDNB for each class of GST varies and so it is not a good measure of activity for some forms (e.g. GSTT and GSTZ). Medical use DNCB can be used to treat warts with an effective cure rate of 80%. DNCB induces an allergic immune response toward the wart-causing virus.  Safety  DNCB induces a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in almost all people exposed to it, so it is used medically to assess the T cell activity in patients. This is a useful diagnostic test for immunocompromised patients. It can also be used to treat warts. DNCB can cause contact dermatitis.

Note the variable fee. A high-occupancy toll lane (or HOT lane) is a type of traffic lane or roadway that is available to high- occupancy vehicles and other exempt vehicles without charge; other vehicles are required to pay a variable fee that is adjusted in response to demand. Unlike toll roads, drivers have an option to use general purpose lanes, on which a fee is not charged. Express toll lanes, which are less common, operate along similar lines, but do not exempt high-occupancy vehicles. History The concept developed from high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV) systems in order to increase use of the available capacity. Most implementations are currently in the United States. The first practical implementation was California's formerly private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County, California, in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 in northern San Diego. According to the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute, there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes in operation in the United States and 163 corridor-miles under construction. See Figure 2, pp.6 The first HOT lane implementation in Canada was along the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) freeway in Ontario. Existing high-occupancy vehicle lanes were redesignated as HOT lanes for a stretch of the QEW between Oakville and Burlington. The initial system consisted of $180 permits valid for three months, though HOT lanes with electronic tolling infrastructure were announced as part of forthcoming expansions to Ontario Highway 427. Design Greater Los Angeles, CA, US Some systems are reversible, operating in one direction during the morning commute and in the reverse direction during the evening commute. The toll is typically collected using electronic toll collection systems, automatic number plate recognition, or at manned toll booths. Exempt vehicles typically include those with at least two, three or four occupants, those that use approved alternative fuels, motorcycles, transit vehicles and emergency vehicles. The fee, which is displayed prominently at entry points to the lanes, is adjusted in response to demand to regulate the traffic volume and thereby provided a guaranteed minimum traffic speed and level of service.FAQ - VA I-495 HOT Lanes Retrieved October 6, 2009Brookings Institution economic study on HOT Lanes MD I-95 Express Toll Lanes Retrieved October 6, 2009 The Los Angeles Metro ExpressLanes HOT system requires vehicles to be fitted with manually \\"switchable\\" transponders where the driver selects the number of occupants, based on which the appropriate fee is charged. California Highway Patrol officers have in-vehicle devices which display the declared occupancy of a vehicle, which they can verify visually and cite any driver(s) with fewer occupants than declared (and tolled for). The new system proved itself to be highly effective in reducing the rate of lane-use violations, with it falling to 40-50% of the violation rates of other comparable California highways, from more than 20-25% (nearly one out of four or five) to just 10% (one in ten). Other transportation officials in California took note of this, subsequently leading to the Bay Area officials of Alameda County to adopt a similar system for the (then) planned Interstate 580. Funding and construction Implementation of these systems can be prohibitively expensive, due to the initial construction required‚Äîparticularly with regard to providing access to and from the express toll lanes at interchanges. However, the long-term benefits‚Äîthe decrease in delay to able motorists and increased funding for the transportation agency‚Äîmay outweigh the costs. To offset costs of construction, many transportation agencies lease public roads to a private institution. As a result, construction may be partially or fully funded by the private institution, which receives all of the income from tolling for a specified period.About I-495 HOT Lanes Retrieved August 31, 2009 Criticism Afternoon rush hour in Miami, where tolled express lanes have become congested and \\"closed\\" Because HOT lanes and ETLs are often constructed within the existing road space, they are criticized as being an environmental tax or \\"Lexus lanes\\" solely beneficial to higher-income individuals, since one toll rate is charged regardless of socioeconomic status and the working poor thus suffer greater financial burden. Supporters of HOT lanes counter with the fact that because HOT lanes encourage the use of public transit and ride sharing, they reduce transportation demands and provide a benefit for all.MTC Planning - HOV/HOT Lanes Retrieved October 6, 2009 However, current American public transportation is still viewed and characterized as a form of welfare, leading to paradoxical expenses as public tax dollars across the US bear high subsidies for transit services, while delivering low ridership levels, fewer service hours than other major countries with public transit systems, and longer wait times between trip destinations. Furthermore, HOT lanes have demonstrated no guarantees in eliminating traffic congestion, bringing into question, their fundamental usefulness aside from raising funds for private institutions and local governments.

Eventually the lead role was given to Victor McLaglen and John Farrow was given the job of directing. A key support part was given to Barry Fitzgerald, who had appeared in The Informer (1935) with McLaglen and had not made a film since Bringing Up Baby (1938); he had most recently been on Broadway in The White Steed. Lucille Ball was to play the female lead but was ultimately unable to because she was recovering from an operation for appendicitis. Filming started 15 June 1939.

During the 1970s the profile was changed, so that it became the leading Swedish consulting company throughout the 1970s with some ten offices around the world. The institute developed a method for organization development, based on a strong theoretical foundation that was inspired by American researchers such as Herbert Simon, Philip Selznick and James D. Thompson. The SIAR school of management described strategy development and long range planning as a problem solving and decision making process. Later, inspired by among others, Professors Chris Argyris and Donald Schon, Eric Rhenman, and other leading researchers and consultants at SIAR, contributed to the development of the theories of organizational learning.

The Bidiakis cube can also be constructed from a cube by adding edges across the top and bottom faces which connect the centres of opposite sides of the faces. The two additional edges need to be perpendicular to each other. With this construction, the Bidiakis cube is a polyhedral graph, and can be realized as a convex polyhedron.

Bachmann, who is from Malters, moved to Sweden aged 16 and played for Ume√• IK for four seasons from 2007 until 2011. She spent the 2010 season playing in the United States for Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) club Atlanta Beat. Ahead of the 2012 season she left Ume√• and signed a contract with LdB FC Malm√∂. She went to German Allianz Frauen- Bundesliga club VfL Wolfsburg in the summer of 2015. Since making her debut for the Switzerland women's national football team in June 2007, Bachmann has won over 50 caps. She made her reputation with Switzerland's youth national teams, playing at the 2006 and 2010 editions of the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and being named UEFA's Golden Player at the 2009 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship. At senior level Bachmann helped Switzerland qualify for the FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time in 2015. A persistent back injury hampered Bachmann's progress during the early part of her career. Club career Starting her career in FC Malters before moving to SC Luwin, she then rejected offers from both Germany and USA to sign for Swedish club Ume√• IK in Damallsvenskan at the age of 16 in 2007. Following Marta's departure from the club in 2009, Bachmann became a key player at Ume√•. She was voted Swiss female Player of the Year in 2009. In 2010, Bachmann joined new Women's Professional Soccer expansion team Atlanta Beat as their No. 1 pick in the 2009 WPS International Draft. After an injury-hit season in the professional WPS, and after her contract with the Atlanta Beat was not renewed, Bachmann rejected offers from Germany, England and the United States to return to Ume√• for the 2011 season. She was named the best player of the 2011 season, and subsequently moved to defending champion LdB Malm√∂. Playing alongside Marta, Mittag and others, she slowly turned into one of the best footballers in the world. She won the Damallsvenskan in her last season with LdB Malm√∂. On 26 August 2015 it was announced that Bachmann had joined German side VfL Wolfsburg for a contract that will last until 2018. She was chosen Swiss Player of the Year for a second time in 2015. In December 2016, London-based FA WSL club Chelsea announced that Bachmann had agreed to join them when the transfer window opened the following month. In 2018, on 5 May, Bachmann scored twice, including the winning goal, in the Women's FA Cup final against Arsenal, a game which ended 3‚Äì1 to Bachmann's team, Chelsea. She was named the Player of the Match by commentator Sue Smith. On 3 July 2020, French club Paris Saint-Germain announced the signing of Bachmann on a two-year deal. International career Ramona Bachmann playing for Switzerland, October 2012 Bachmann played for Switzerland in the 2006 and 2010 editions of the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. During the latter tournament she was hampered by a back injury. At the 2009 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship in Belarus, Bachmann won the UEFA.com Golden Player award. Bachmann made her debut for the Swiss senior team against Sweden in June 2007, while only being 16 years of age . In September 2010 Bachmann scored in Switzerland's 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifying defeat against England, but was criticised for her play acting that led to the dismissal of England goalkeeper Rachel Brown. Bachmann admitted there was no foul and apologised for her actions, while Brown's red card was rescinded on appeal. Bachmann was ruled out of the following play-offs against Denmark due to her persistent back pain. Bachmann's biggest achievement so far was the qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, in Canada. Switzerland had never before qualified for a World Cup. After winning their home game against Malta, the team was sitting in front of the TV watching the game between Denmark and Iceland. If it ended in a draw, the Swiss would secure the group's victory. As said by herself: \\"When it ended in a draw and it was certain we had won the group, we started dancing on the tables.\\" During the World cup, Switzerland reached the round of 16, with Bachmann scoring three times, all in a 10‚Äì1 victory over hapless Ecuador. The Swiss were edged out by hosts Canada, due to one goal by Jos√©e B√©langer, just after the half- time break. After the World Cup, there were multiple clubs interested in the 24-year-old Bachmann, and she chose VfL Wolfsburg.

Latvia (48321/99) was a case argued before the European Court of Human Rights and decided in 2003. Facts Ms. T. Slivenko was born in Estonia in 1959 and at the age of one month she moved to Latvia together with her parents. Her husband, N. Slivenko, born in 1952, was transferred to Latvia in 1977 to serve as a Soviet military officer. He met T. Slivenko in Latvia and married her there in 1980. In 1981, T. Slivenko gave birth to their daughter K. Slivenko. After Latvia regained independence, the already retired N. Slivenko was ordered to leave the country as a former Soviet/Russian officer by the Citizenship and Migration Authority, referring to the Russian- Latvian treaty of 1994. K. and T. Slivenko were ordered to leave Latvia, too, as members of N. Slivenko's family. T. Slivenko contested this decision, referring to the facts that she was a daughter of permanent residents of Latvia and she didn't come to Latvia as wife of N. Slivenko. After unsuccessful court proceedings, all three Slivenkos left Latvia, leaving there the parents of T. Slivenko. They contested their deportation before ECtHR. Third-party comments were received from the Russian Government, having exercised its right to intervene. In 2001, the Second Section of ECtHR has relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber. In 2002, the Grand Chamber dismissed claims by N. Slivenko as inadmissible, but declared admissible the application of T. Slivenko and K. Slivenko concerning Articles 5, 8 and 14. Judgment In the court' s evaluation, a scheme for withdrawal of foreign troops and their families based on a general finding that their removal was necessary for national security was not as such incompatible with Article 8, but implementation of such a scheme without any possibility of taking into account individual circumstances was. T. and K. Slivenkos were integrated into Latvian society at the time and could not be regarded as endangering national security because they were part of T. Slivenko's father's family, who had retired in 1986, had remained in Latvia and was not himself considered to present any such danger. The court therefore has found a violation of the Article 8 of ECHR in respect of K. Slivenko and T. Slivenko and no need to deal separately with the complaints under Article 14, by 11 votes against 6. The court has concluded besides, that there was no violation of Article 5, by 16 votes against 1. Judges Wildhaber, Ress, Bratza, Cabral Barreto, Greve and Maruste have filed dissenting opinions, considering that Article 8 wasn't violated. Judge Kovler has filed an opinion dissenting in part, considering that Article 5 was violated, too, and concurring in part concerning Article 8.

The most common products used today to measure spirits are the thimble measure and the non-drip measure, often referred to as an optic. The terms Optic, Optic Pearl, OpticJade and OpticOpal are all trademarks of Gaskell & Chambers owned by the company IMI Cornelius (UK) Ltd, but the word ‚Äúoptic‚Äù has become synonymous with inverted or non-drip spirit measures. Other manufacturers, such as Beaumont TM, also supply this type of measuring device.  Optic measure  The optic or non-drip measure is mounted beneath an inverted spirit bottle, so that a pre-defined volume of the bottle's contents drains into the measure. Lifting a lever on the side of the measure first closes off the measure from the bottle, then dispenses the measured liquid into the glass or mixing vessel held underneath. This mechanism ensures that a correct spirit measure can be dispensed each time, as the inverted bottle allows the measure to be replenished in the optic after each shot has been dispensed. These types of measures are commonly used for highly demanded drinks in professional bar settings, and are often incorporated into visually-appealing machines that serve both functional and marketing purposes for the liquor being poured. Bottles are available to the trade with their labels affixed upside down so that they will be the right way up when mounted on the optic.  Thimble measure  The thimble measure is a stainless steel vessel, like a shot glass, either with predefined measuring lines etched or stamped into the sides, or else pre-sized so that pouring up to the brim of the measure yields the correct volume. This second variation is commonly seen in a double-thimble or \\"hourglass\\" form, with two metal cups of different volumes (often in a 3:2 or 2:1 ratio, like a U.S. standard 1.5 fl oz \\"jigger\\" and 1 fl oz \\"pony\\", or UK standard 25/50mL or 35/70mL combos) spot-welded to each other at their relative bottom surfaces, possibly with a handle between them, allowing one unit to easily measure two common volumes. Thimble measures are popular for home use, as they allow a relatively untrained person to pour quickly and accurately from several bottles without risking cross-contamination between them, or requiring the purchase, use and cleaning of a pour spout for each bottle as would be seen in a professional bar.  Free-flow pour spout  Common in U.S. bars, these devices consist of a simple rubber or plastic stopper with a metal or plastic tube fitted into it, and often a second smaller tube extending down into the bottle, designed to replace the cap or cork on a bottle of liquor. The spout, in the U.S., is usually calibrated to allow a flow of 1 fluid ounce per second, so that a bartender can measure accurate and consistent shots of liquor or portions for cocktails based on timed pours, without needing to use a jigger or other measuring device.  Measured pour spout  Common in U.S. bars, these devices appear visually to be the same as a free-flow pour spout, but have an internal mechanism to block the tube after a pre-defined and calibrated volume of liquid has passed, oftentimes a set of 2 or 3 balls. Because of the geometry, the bottle with one of these spouts needs to be held at a specific angle, typically 45 degrees, otherwise the volume poured will be under or over the stated calibration.  Ball-measuring cap  Common in France, where it is called a bouchon doseur boule, this device consists of a transparent T-shaped glass tube arrangement, with a ball on one end of the horizontal section, a cap or cork on the other end, and a cork or plastic bottle stopper on the bottom of the T, allowing the measure to replace the cap of a liquor bottle. In use, the bottle is inverted until the ball fills with liquor, and then tilted in the other direction to let the liquor pour out the spout in a manner that keeps additional liquor entering the measure from the bottle.  United Kingdom  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 made it illegal in Britain for businesses to give short weights or short measures to consumers. Before this there was no legislation, only guidelines as to the correct weight of an alcoholic spirit measure, and if spirit measures or optics were used, they required a government stamp to certify that the measure was accurate. This Act specified that only gin, rum, vodka and whisky were spirits and had to be served in the prescribed measured quantities using an approved optic measure. All other drinks are not spirits (for the purposes of the act) and could be free poured. Today, these other drinks may not be free poured, but must be measured, though the bar is free to choose the size of the measure (which must be advertised). In practice, most bars will use the same size measure as for the four spirits.https://www.btbl.co.uk/news/weights-measures The 1963 Act formalized the legal measures by which spirits and other alcoholic beverages should be dispensed, namely 1/4 gill (35.5 ml), 1/5 gill (28.4 ml) or 1/6 gill (23.7 ml), but this was replaced in 1985 by 25ml or 35ml were permitted. Landlords have the option to decide which quantity they sell, with the difference being caused by historically larger measures being used in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The landlord can choose one or the other but not both. Thimble measures are also used in 175ml and 250ml volumes for measuring wine. Although government stamped for the correct volume, the thimble measure does rely on the user measuring the wine out manually into the thimble.

FC Magdeburg. As a defender he won the championship four times between 1964 and 1975. Ohm began to play football in the youth department of BSG Lokomotive Haldensleben, north of Magdeburg. In 1962 he joined the focus club of BSG Lokomotive, SC Lokomotive Leipzig, after playing four matches for the youth national team in the spring. When football in Leipzig was reorganized in 1963, Ohm belonged to the players that joined BSG Chemie Leipzig ‚Äì those players were thought to have less potential than their comrades who joined SC Leipzig. However, at the end of the 1963‚Äì64 season, BSG Chemie Leipzig won the championship, with Ohm appearing in four matches. He stayed with Chemie Leipzig until 1968 and appeared in 33 matches for the side. However, when they won the FDGB-Pokal in 1966, Ohm was missing from the final squad. At the beginning of the 1968‚Äì69 season, Ohm joined 1. FC Magdeburg and won the cup for the first time in 1969. Not only did he play in the final this time, but also scored two goals in Magdeburg's 4‚Äì0 victory over FC Karl-Marx-Stadt. Three more seasons followed Ohm's second title. He was part of Magdeburg's championship squad in 1972 (7 matches), 1974 (3), and 1975 (3). However, he was neither part of the team that won the FDGB-Pokal again in 1973 nor did he play in the 1974 European Cup Winners' Cup Final when 1. FC Magdeburg won the title by defeating AC Milan. In fact, Ohm only played in one first round match in this European cup season. 1974 also marks the end of Ohm's Oberliga career. In his six years with 1. FC Magdeburg, he had played in 78 matches, bringing his total to 111. He went on to play for Magdeburg's reserve team until 1976, when the club retired him officially before Magdeburg met F.C. Hansa Rostock in the Oberliga. After his playing career Ohm turned to managing, taking over second-tier club Stahl Blankenburg in 1976. The team had finished 9th in the previous season, and Ohm led them to four second and one third rank in the second-tier DDR-Liga, division C. Between 1981 and 1983 Ohm was in charge of another DDR-Liga side, Lokomotive Stendal, but saw the clubs relegated to the third-tier Bezirksliga in 1983. His last management job saw him take over Chemie Ilmenau for the 1983‚Äì84 season, but the team only finished in 9th place. Until 2006, Ohm served on the board of Lok Stendal.

The programme helps new and host entrepreneurs to develop relevant skills for managing and expanding their own business. The duration of the stay abroad can be between one and six months. The European Union provides some financial support to the new entrepreneurs for their stay abroad. Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is financed by the European Commission and operates with the help of intermediary organisationshttp://www.erasmus- entrepreneurs.eu/page.php?cid=5 competent in business support, coordinated by a Support Officehttp://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/page.php?pid=016 (currently run by EUROCHAMBRES). By February 2017, more than 4,500 exchanges http://www.erasmus- entrepreneurs.eu/press/EYE_Programme_statistics_(January_2017)_58a61ff0b9417.pdf have been established and over 15,000 applicationshttp://www.erasmus- entrepreneurs.eu/press/EYE_Programme_statistics_(January_2017)_58a61ff0b9417.pdf have been received  Aim of the programme  Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs aims at fostering the entrepreneurial spirit and cross-border trade in Europe by facilitating exchange of knowledge, experience and networking between entrepreneurs intending to start a business or having just started one, and experienced entrepreneurs by working alongside each other. The programme also aims at guiding businesses on how to overcome market and business obstacles, so that they can make the most of the European Single Market. Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs in a nutshell: * It offers new entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn from an experienced entrepreneur who is running a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) in another participating country, * It enables the exchange of experience between new and experienced entrepreneurs, * It facilitates access to new markets and the search for potential business partners, * It enhances networking between entrepreneurs and between SMEs, * It allows experienced entrepreneurs to develop new commercial relations and find out more about opportunities in another EU country.  History and development of Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs  In 2007, the European Parliament introduced a new budget line entitled \\"Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs‚Äù. The European Commission then started to design the Pilot Project with the aim of supporting mobility periods abroad for recently established and nascent entrepreneurs, with a view to improving their skills and fostering the cross-border transfer of knowledge and experience between entrepreneurs. Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs comes under the Small Business Act for Europe which considers this initiative a key contribution ‚Äúto create an environment within which entrepreneurs and family businesses can thrive and entrepreneurship is rewarded‚Äù. It currently falls under Programme for the Competitiveness of enterprises and SME's (COSME) 2014-2020.http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme/index_en.htmhttps://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme/supporting- entrepreneurs_en Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is to a certain extent similar to the well-known Erasmus Programme for students as is a mobility action which addresses a particular target group. However, it is also clearly different: whereas the existing Erasmus programme in higher education enhances student-to-university relationships, the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs focuses on business-to-business relationships.

She was the sister of well known Turkish painter and poet, Bedri Rahmi Ey√ºboƒülu, and Sabahattin Ey√ºboƒülu, an author, academic and translator. Her father, Mehmet Rahmi, was the Governor of Trabzon and a member of parliament chosen by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Her family moved to Istanbul, where she enrolled in a regular high school, unlike many of her peers who often attended all girls colleges. After graduating from high school, Ey√ºboƒülu was educated in fine arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul and became an architect in 1942. She later explained her family's commitment to education, especially for women, saying, \\"We grew up with Atat√ºrk's reforms. That was what Atat√ºrk had indoctrinated in us. That we would finish school and serve our country.\\" After the academy, she began working in the small village of Hasanoƒülan, Ankara Province, where she facilitated the construction of a village institutes. The Turkish government was working to develop the small villages and communities of Anatolia at the time, and the village institutes were considered essential to educating its citizens. Ey√ºboƒülu later said in an interview: Ey√ºboƒülu planned new institutes and schools in villages throughout rural Turkey during the 1940s. She caught malaria in 1947, which forced her to leave Anatolia and move back to Istanbul. The government also ended its support for the village institute program during the 1950s, which forced her to settle in Istanbul. She began working at the Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts once she recovered from malaria. However, she soon began traveling outside Istanbul again as an excavation architect. In 1948, she met her future husband Robert Anhegger, a German scholar in the field of Ottoman and Turkish studies. The couple married in 1958 using an ancient wedding ring. > We got married in 1958, in the 10th anniversary of our friendship. He > proposed to me with a ring that was from the 4th century A.D.

Her most famous restoration projects included the landmark Topkapƒ± Palace's harem section and Rumelihisarƒ±. In 2008 she was given a special jury award for in the Achievement Award for special contribution in architecture at the Turkish National Architecture Awards in Ankara. Ey√ºboƒülu and Anhegger bought an apartment in a legendary building in Istanbul's Galata district in 1964. She decorated her apartment with artifacts collected from throughout her travels in Anatolia. The couple remained married until Anhegger's death in 2001. She mourned the death of her husband, with whom she had been together for more than 40 years, \\"I couldn't accept his will to be cremated. After his cremation, I lived with his ashes in the house for a week.\\" She continued to live at her residence following Anhegger's death. Her goal was to donate her collection to a small museum. Unfortunately her wish was not realized, as her heirs sold the entire contents of that magical apartment to the highest bidder. Mualla Ey√ºboƒülu Anhegger died on August 16, 2009, at the age of 90.

The structure within the 3' UTR has been previously characterised as the 3' cap-independent translation element (3' TE element) and the 5' UTR of barley yellow dwarf virus has been predicted to contain 4 stem loop structures.

It caters for children aged 3 to 19 and has 1,769 pupils on roll . History The history of senior school education in Swindon can be traced back to the 19th century. In 1943, the College and Euclid Street Secondary Schools amalgamated to become Headlands Grammar School, a selective mixed school for those who passed the Eleven plus. With some 800 boys and girls, it moved into new buildings on the site of the present school in 1952. In 1964, the Grammar School became a comprehensive school for students aged 14‚Äì19, changing its name to the Headlands School. It later lost its Sixth form, becoming an 11‚Äì16 school. The Headlands Comprehensive School was closed on 31 August 2004, and on 1 September 2004, a school called Headlands School was established as a community school. As a result of a further merging of schools, Swindon Academy opened on the site in September 2007, replacing Headlands School, Pinehurst Junior School, and Pinehurst Infant School. The former grammar school buildings were demolished in December 2009. Admissions It is run by United Learning, formerly the United Church Schools Trust.

Born to a Jewish family in born in Szombathely, from six weeks after birth Lukacs lived in Vienna, Austria. There he received primary and secondary education and studied mathematics at University of Vienna. His professors included Hans Hahn, Eduard Helly, Walter Meyer, Leopold Vietoris and Wilhelm Wirtinger. In 1930 he earned his doctorate in geometry under the supervision of Walter Meyer, and a degree in actuarial science in 1931. Eugene met his future wife Elizabeth Weisz (Lisl) in 1927 at the University of Vienna, and they married in 1935. He taught secondary mathematics for two years and later accepted a position with an insurance company, where Eduard Helly and Z. W. Birnbaum were colleagues. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he decided to emigrate to the United States, arriving in 1939.Rohatgi (1988) In 1953 Eugene joined the Office of Naval Research (ONR) USA, and became the director of Statistics. While at ONR he also taught at American University in Washington, D.C. Lukacs joined the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. in 1955. There he organized the Statistical Laboratory in 1959 and became its first and only director. Researchers at the Statistical Laboratory included Edward Batschlet, Tatsuo Kawata, Radha Laha, M. Masuyama and Vijay Rohatgi, and many distinguished visitors. On his retirement from Catholic University in 1972, he moved with his colleagues Laha and Rohatgi to Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he remained until 1976. His primary interest was in the theory of characteristic functions. Prior to publication of his 1960 monograph, Characteristic Functions, the English language textbooks on the subject were translations of works by Cramer, Gnedenko and Kolmogorov, and Lo√®ve. Lukacs' monograph was the first to present a unified and detailed treatment of the subject, and has remained a classical reference on the subject. The revised and expanded second edition of Characteristic Functions appeared in 1970, followed by Developments in Characteristics Function Theory in 1983. Characteristic Functions has been translated into several languages and continues to be an essential resource on the subject. Lukacs was an elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics since 1957, and a Fellow of the American Statistical Association since 1969. In 1973 he was elected to the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

It was originally proposed by Chevalier de Clerville and accepted by Pierre Paul Riquet as an integral part of the Canal du Midi. Riquet needed to provide a sufficient water reservoir to allow the locks to function year round, even in the dry summer season. The dam was begun on 15 April 1667 and was completed in four years. It was the first dam built specifically to supply water to a navigable canal and was by far the greatest single work of civil engineering undertaken during the building of the Canal du Midi. The dam has a crest length of , a maximum height of , and a base thickness of more than . Water may be drawn from the reservoir via a stone vaulted tunnel that penetrates the base of the dam. Silt can be removed from the floor of the reservoir through the tunnel. When filled to capacity, the reservoir contains some of water. Originally, the basin was to be fed by only the River Laudot. When this was deemed to be insufficient, other streams fed into what Riquet called the \\"rigole de la montagne\\". Rigole is a diversionary channel. This stream would have included contributions from the River Alzau, River Vernassone, River Lampillon, River Lampy, and River Rieutort. The stream passed through the long, diameter Cammazes Tunnel on its way to the basin. The tunnel was built by the military engineer Marshall Sebastien Vauban in 1686-87. The entrance of the Laudot into the basin is split so that one portion goes into the basin and the other portion diverts around the basin and returns to the Laudot downstream of the dam. The waters released from the dam follow the downstream route of the Laudot until they join with the rigole de la plaine at Les Thoumazes. The waters continue to the Bassin de Naurouze before entering the canal itself. Though Riquet took credit for the water supply provided by the basin, much of the knowledge required was provided by Pierre Campmas, a fontainier, and Fran√ßois Andr√©ossy, an hydraulics engineer. The lake lies in the three communes of Vaudreuille (Haute-Garonne), Les Brunels (Aude) and Sor√®ze (Tarn). References Gallery Image:Lac St-Fereol 01.JPG|Release of dam water from Lake St. Ferr√©ol.

Yardley began his career as a goalkeeper before becoming a centre forward, most notably for Tranmere Rovers F.C.. Playing career Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Yardley played his first football as a goalkeeper as an eight-year-old playing for Dunnikier Primary School. However, on moving to Temple Hall Secondary School he was forced to play as a forward because another goalkeeper was already playing. At Frances Colliery Juniors he played mostly as a forward, occasionally playing in goal. In 1959 he signed an amateur contract with East Fife as a goalkeeper. After sustaining a hand injury in 1960 Yardley switched to primarily playing as a forward though he did play a number of matches in goal. In 1964 Yardley trialled with Forfar Athletic, playing four matches. He then played out the second half of the 1963/1964 season with Montrose. Yardley played for Australian club St. George- Budapest in three separate stints. He played one season at St. George during the 1965 Australian season after emigrating to Australia in August 1964.www.since1888.co.uk Retrieved 1 September 2009 On returning from Australia in October 1966, Yardley trialled for a month with English Fourth Division team Luton Town, playing one match. In November 1966 he moved to Tranmere Rovers. In four seasons between 1966 and 1970 he played 123 matches, scoring 68 goals. He was leading goal scorer for Rovers on four separate occasions. His second stint in Australia was in 1969 before returning to Tranmere Rovers. At the completion of his career at Tranmere he moved again to Australia. Yardley had a short stint with Altrincham in the 1973‚Äì74 season. International career Yardley played one match on 5 March 1960 for Scotland Amateurs against Wales at Rugby Park in Kilmarnock, which ended 3-3.

History First known as the Waste Water Garden, the EcocyclET is a bio-engineered system whose technologies were developed and licensed by David Del Porto of the Ecological Engineering Group in Concord, MA, from a concept originally conceived and tested by University of Toronto environmental engineering professor Alfred Bernhart (\\"Evapotranspiration Nutrient uptake Soil infiltration of Effluent water‚Äù A.P. Bernhart). In 2004, Centre for Sustainable Watersheds completed the installation of Canada‚Äôs first EcocyclET. This prototype was initiated to demonstrate a sustainable technology for rural wastewater management, ensuring zero discharge to the ground. Method Most plants use photosynthesis and evapotranspiration (ET). EcocyclET is a closed- loop operation that employs lined beds of sand, crushed stone and gravels and specified plantings. Effluent from septic tanks, greywater, composting toilets leachate or urine from separating toilets, is recirculated through the bed. There, naturally occurring micro-organisms convert the chemical constituents of the wastewater into nutrients for plants growth. The impervious bed liner ensures that no effluent can enter the subsurface environment or nearby receiving waters. All the wastewater will be ultimately transpirated as un- transpirated effluent is drained back into a recycle tank, stored and pumped back to the bed when the conditions for evapotranspiration are optimal. The system can also by used as a greywater reuse planter to be installed where soils are too poor to be considered for a soil absorption system.

Measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, it also shook the islands of Pico and Faial, and resulted from a strike slip fracture, typical of other historical Azorean earthquakes. In response to the earthquake, Portuguese president Ant√≥nio Ramalho Eanes announced three days of national mourning, while relief efforts, initiated by agents of the local Air Force, were soon accompanied by government-supported agencies.  Geology   Background  In 1950, another strong earthquake had rocked the Azores Islands region, and this was the largest earthquake since.Western Newspapers (2 January 1980)  Description  Volcanic in origin, the Azores lie in a tectonically complex area on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, between the European, Eurasian and African plate boundaries, forming their own microplate.Borges et al. (2007), p.37‚Äì54 The 1980 earthquake was the result of movement along the northwest to southeast trending strike-slip fault. After aftershocks from the quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal solution to the small events. Movement of these shocks was similar to that of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.  Damage and casualties  The earthquake that struck the Azorean islands was 6.9 . It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, S√£o Jorge Island, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% of the houses on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Hero√≠smo. In general, public buildings such as churches remained intact, while several buildings caved in on themselves. Public utilities such as electricity and water, were reported cut in several areas. Initially, the number of fatalities was set at 52, but it was later revised to 61. Additionally, the injuries were set at 300, but this was also revised to more than 400. At least 20,000 people were left homeless. Minor damage was recorded at Pico and Faial islands. No fatalities were recorded at the Lajes Field air base, nor any major damage.  Relief efforts and response  United States Navy and Air Force troops stationed at Lajes functioned as disaster relief workers, sheltering as many as 150 families. Portuguese Air Force members brought supplies to earthquake victims, while a Jo√£o Coutinho class corvette navy ship transported medical officials to the island. The Portuguese President, Ant√≥nio Ramalho Eanes, flew in on a plane accompanied by medical personnel and supplies (such as bedding). Local officials including policemen and volunteer firemen cleared roads for relief supplies and transports. Responding to the situation, these officials were also involved in looking for survivors in the rubble. Soon after, tents were erected to replace the destroyed or unsafe homes for approximately 200 families of the islands. Portable homes were constructed by the People to People International project fund, resulting in 100 shelters. Three days of national mourning were declared by Eanes. Following the relief efforts, 19 seismographic stations were installed to monitor seismic activities. Eleven of these were used to monitor earthquake activity, while the other eight also record information on the island's geothermal areas. The earthquake forced hundreds of people to leave the country for the United States. It occurred during a period of several major natural disasters in which many residents of the island left; in 1975, 8,000 residents left. In 1981, however, just 2,500 people left the island. Dino Meira, a Portuguese-American singer, recorded and sold a 45 single \\"Acores 20 para as 4\\" with the proceeds donated to the earthquake relief effort.  Analysis and current situation  Later studies of the events leading up to the tragedy found several factors contributing to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code, nor had they been adequately examined. The area around the Azores remains active. Threats from earthquakes and landslides remain.

Caroline Olivia Nonesi Moser is an academic specializing in social policy and urban social anthropology. She is primarily known for her field-based approach to research on the informal sector generally - but particularly aspects such as poverty, violence, asset vulnerability and strategies for accumulation in the urban setting. Gender analysis is central to her approach. She has looked at many countries, but the Americas have been her main interest. Countries studied closely include Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Jamaica. She has also researched community participation, looking at the social dimensions of economic reform, the role of human rights, social protection and responses of the urban environment to climate change.  Education  Prof Moser has a Ph.D. from Sussex University, (1975) a postgraduate diploma from Manchester University (1968) and a BA from Durham University (1967). Profile at Brookings Institution  Career  Her career has included time at University College London (1978‚Äì1986); London School of Economics (1986‚Äì1990); the World Bank (1990‚Äì2000); the Overseas Development Institute (2001‚Äì2002); The New School (New York)(2002‚Äì2003) Brookings Institution (2004‚Äì2007) and the University of Manchester (2007‚Äìpresent). She currently works as a lecturer and research practitioner in the Global Urban Research Centre within the University of Manchester. Moser developed the Moser Gender Planning Framework, a tool for gender analysis in development planning. The goal is to free women from subordination and allow them to achieve equality, equity and empowerment. The framework defines six tools for systematically analyzing requirements and developing plans.  Gender and Planning Framework  One of Caroline Moser's more notable works is ‚ÄúGender Planning in the Third World: Meeting Practical and Strategic Gender Needs.‚Äù Moser's studies led her to develop a framework in third world countries in terms of gender and planning. The basis of her theory is that men and women simply have different needs from one another, and therefore require different strategies to satisfy those needs. She primarily focused on women in her study, and how to improve frameworks based on the group's specific gender needs. In her paper, she states that when incorporating women into these third world countries‚Äô plans, policy makers need to strategize based on gender ‚Äì not the fact that they are women. Moser supports the feminist view that singling out women as a group as opposed to looking at genders is not useful in planning. She feels that utilizing a generalized gender concept ignores the social relationships that the genders bear to each other. This feminist concept serves as a basic foundation for her argument that since men and women have their own roles in society, they need to be planned for differently. In her paper, Moser introduces her idea of ‚Äúthe triple role of women.‚Äù The three roles of women in low-income households can be summarized as reproductive and community managing work. She says that reproductive work pertains to being the mother in the household; generally, this refers to taking care of the children. Community managing is that women, as the mother figures of their household, are responsible for gathering and keeping the community in check. However, Moser claims that in this role they accept the structure of society and can do very little to actually maintain their community. In contrast, Moser describes men as productive workers with community leadership roles. Moser feels that the two genders have quite contrasting roles in society, and in response, policy makers should take each role into consideration. Her main argument is that the roles mentioned for women (productive and community management) are viewed as natural, and therefore neglected in policy making. She believes that men's roles as the ‚Äúbreadwinners‚Äù and leaders of society is glorified, while the just-as-important roles of women are forgotten about because they are seen as domestic, natural attributes. Another issue Moser finds with the Third World society model is that it discredits other types of household structures, and only takes the Nuclear family into consideration. Moser explains the model forgets about households with single women and ones with temporarily absent men figures. Her so-called ‚Äúwomen-headed‚Äù households are increasing statistically, but Moser says that these women have difficulty accessing the same level of employment and success that their male counterparts achieve. The constraint is thought to be caused by the triple role of women. Moser states that these women must fulfill their roles and do not have the time or access to benefit from program policies and accommodations. The basis for which Moser proposes a solution is that the system must look at the gender's needs. The categories for needs can be broken down into strategic and practical needs. Strategically, Moser believes that men and women need to have gender equality, while practical needs refer to what is relevant to women. Moser more specifically discusses needs regarding employment, human settlements and housing, and basic services. She feels that employment can be altered by teaching women jobs that are traditionally held by men. In her opinion, by introducing women into labor fields that typically men are a part of, it will open up opportunities to make a living and potentially erode at the existing divide of the sexes in the work force. Her framework continues to suggest the need to legalize household enterprises so that women that are tied to their homes can also earn money. Lastly, Moser argues that it is necessary for public transportation that can only be accessed by women. Moser's point of a female transport system is that it will allow women to feel safe when taking care of their needs and errands outside of the house.  Violence Framework  Moser also spent time studying in Latin America, where she wrote her paper ‚ÄúLatin American Urban Violence as a Development Concern: Towards a Framework for Violence Reduction.‚Äù As the title sounds, the paper pushes for a framework to improve the impoverished areas while taking violence into great consideration. She believes that it is crucial to understand and identify the driving forces of all the violence in these urban areas, and come up with a solution to diminish it. Moser promotes a cross-sectoral violence-reduction framework. This framework is important to anthropology because it takes all perspectives into consideration, including first-hand experience and statistics. She mentions that the reason she chose Latin America to develop this framework and study is because the nation has the highest rates of violence recorded. The framework highlights that there is a link between mainly inequality and impoverished communities, mixed in with a number of other factors including violence. Overall, the acts of violence in Latin American communities are contributing to a heightened number of homicides and deaths that the country has never seen before. As opposed to her framework on gender and planning, which primarily focuses on the needs of women, Moser's violence framework is intended to reinforce safety for both genders in impoverished regions. In the paper, violence in distinguished into four main categories: political, institutional, economic, and social. She argues that in separating each form of violence into its own category, then it will become easier for policy makes to identify causes and form solutions. Different countries may have overlapping causes of violence, in which those developing policies can potentially be reused in numerous regions. Her paper introduces what she calls ‚Äúroadmaps,‚Äù which essentially list the categories of violence, the kind of violence, and traces back to what may be the underlying cause.  Contributions  Moser's influence is widespread in articles discussing societal developments that will promote equality. Anthropologists have utilized her framework from ‚ÄúGender Planning in the Third World: Meeting Practical and Strategic Gender Needs‚Äù as the driving force for their papers. For example, anthropologists Fenella Porter and Caroline Sweetman were motivated by Moser and explained how to use gender mainstreaming to raise awareness. They added onto her framework by suggesting education about the domestic/forgotten roles of women, in contrast to their expected roles. Similar to Moser, the article highlights the importance of identifying the various roles of both genders, and how it relates to their economic status. Since Moser is a known feminist, there is a common misconception that she only addresses women in her work. However, some of her frameworks include benefiting both genders. Her gender and planning framework specifically examines the roles of women and how to develop policies that can cater to their needs. On the other hand, her violence framework does not only concern women, but includes men. The violence framework is aimed to protect both genders from the effects of inequality that result in brutality. The only part of her violence framework that separates the two genders is her call for changes in social violence. The other forms of violence are experienced by both genders, but social violence in particular most often portrays men as the violator and woman as the victim. Moser shows great interest in equality for society as a whole.

These are C. elegantissima of the cold North Pacific (at least north to the Gulf of Alaska; the Beaufort Sea is inhabited by C. limacina), C. okhotensis of the Okhotsk Sea (where it overlaps with C. elegantissima), and C. antarctica of Antarctic waters. Clione limacina  Description  There are two subspecies that differentiate in body length. The northern subspecies lives in colder water, matures at and can reach a size of .Kallevik, I.H.F. (2013).

Ecology  Clione limacina inhabits both the epipelagic and mesopelagic regions of the water column.  Feeding habits  Adults feed in a predator-prey relationship almost exclusively on the sea butterflies of the genus Limacina: on Limacina helicina and on Limacina retroversa.Lalli C. M. & Gilmer R. W. (1989). Pelagic Snails. The biology of holoplanktonic gastropod molluscs. Stanford University Press: Stanford, California. page 188.B√∂er M., Gannefors C., Kattner G., Graeve M., Hop H. & Falk-Petersen S. (2005). \\"The Arctic pteropod Clione limacina: seasonal lipid dynamics and life-strategy\\". Marine Biology 147(3): 707‚Äì717. . The feeding process of Clione limacina is somewhat extraordinary. The buccal (\\"mouth\\") apparatus consists of three pairs of buccal cones. These tentacles grab the shell of Limacina helicina. When the prey is in the right position, with its shell opening facing the radula of Clione limacina, it then grasps the prey with its chitinous hooks, everted from hook sacs. Then it extracts the body completely out of its shell and swallows it whole.Hermans C. O. & Satterlie R. A. (1992). \\"Fast-strike feeding behavior in a pteropod mollusk, Clione limacina Phipps\\". The Biological Bulletin, Marine Biological Laboratory, 182: 1‚Äì7. Adult Limacina are absent for much of the year, leaving C. limacina without access to their main food source. A study of 138 C. limacina during a period without adult Limacina found that the stomachs of 24 contained remains of amphipods and 3 contained remains of calanoids. This temporary prey change may allow them to survive in periods of starvation, although the species can survive for one year without food.B√∂er M., Graeve M. & Kattner G. (2006). \\"Exceptional long-term starvation ability and sites of lipid storage of the Arctic pteropod Clione limacina\\". Polar Biology 30(5): 571‚Äì580. . Under such exceptional starvation in the laboratory the length of slugs have decreased on average from . The earliest larvae stages of C. limacina feed on phytoplankton, but from the later laval stage this changes to Limacina. The development of these two species is parallel and small C. limacina feed on Limacina of a similar size, while large C. limacina avoid small Limacina (including its larvae).  Life cycle  In Svalbard, the life cycle of C. limacina appears to be at least 2 years. It is a hermaphrodite and observations suggest this is simultaneous. It breeds during the spring and summer, and the eggs are about . Clione limacina is a prey of planktonic feeders, such as the baleen whales, which historically led to sailors naming it \\"whale-food\\". Some fishes are also its predators. For example, the Chum Salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, is a major predator of sea angels.

In 2007 however, he went to Sweden and had a hair transplant, and accordingly \\"no longer have the typical comb over\\" as he commented. Political career Hedstr√∏m joined Anders Lange's Party (which later became the current Progress Party) already in its founding year of 1973. Before joining Anders Lange's Party, he had been a member of the Young Conservatives. Hedstr√∏m was a Member of Parliament from √òstfold from 1989 to 2005, and was one of the most profiled, and controversial, Progress Party politicians during the 1990s. In 1995, Hedstr√∏m was behind an infamous proposal in parliament, the so-called \\"immigration account\\" () known as \\"Document nr. 8:29\\" (Dokument nr. 8:29). The proposal called for a study by the government on the costs of the asylum, refugee and immigration policy, in addition to demanding the presentation of a parliamentary message about the \\"long-term consequences and effects on Norwegian society by the growing number of immigrants with a different and foreign culture\\". It later became known that Hedstr√∏m had received assistance from a member of the Norwegian League for the document. By May 1995, the 24-page document had been printed in 2,500 copies. Being noted for his tough stance on immigration, controversy erupted when he was revealed to have held a speech at the 1995 Norwegian League meeting at Godlia kino, resulting in Hedstr√∏m being stripped of his position as Spokesperson of Immigration Issues for the party. Hedstr√∏m later said that he felt he had made two mistakes at the meeting; the first to have held a speech, and the second to not have left when he saw who was present there. After this controversy, he received competition for his candidacy in the nomination for the 1997 election in √òstfold. In the end, he won 63-29 against the rather unknown Vigdis Giltun (who was favoured by the nomination committee), and to what was called an \\"absolute rarity\\" in Norwegian politics, even a group of pro-Hedstr√∏m demonstrators showed up outside the nomination meeting, displaying his strong grassroots support. In 1999 Hedstr√∏m and his close party colleague Vidar Kleppe arranged several \\"talk shows\\" or public meetings critical of immigration, popularly known as the \\"Hedstr√∏m & Kleppe Show\\". The √òstfold chapter of the party had before the 2001 election expressed that they did not want Hedstr√∏m running as a candidate for the county. But even with the ongoing exclusion of several controversial Progress Party politicians, he remained in the party, won the nomination for √òstfold and was elected to parliament for his fourth term. It has been noted that the support for the Progress Party in √òstfold in 2002 was more than 10% higher than the national average. In 2004, he however announced that he would not run for reelection. Political views In parliament, Hedstr√∏m was known as a strong critic of the governmental immigration policy, and his statements on the matter garnered both popular praise as well as criticism. In 1995 he was criticised by some for drawing lines between Samis and immigrants. Hedstr√∏m criticised the governmental granting of special rights to Samis (in this case concerning reindeerherding, which was also opposed by the Centre, Liberal, Conservative and Progress Party) but also criticised that also immigrants by this in a similar manner could demand special rights in the future. He maintained that the Progress Party rejected any demands of special treatment based on ethnicity.

Ridge A is a low ridge of ice and has been estimated to have very low disturbances to visibility, such as thick atmospheric boundary layer, amount of water vapour and numerous others. The site represents the \\"Eye of the Storm\\", whereby winds flowing off Antarctica in all directions appear to start from a point at Ridge A, where winds are at their calmest. It is also the site of a vortex in which swirling stratospheric winds high up and calm air at ground level combine to make it a place for viewing into space that is three times clearer than any other location on Earth.Casey, Scott. \\"The coldest, driest place in the world\\", Brisbane Times, September 2, 2009. Accessed September 9, 2009. Researchers on the project suggested that photographs taken through a telescope at Ridge A could be nearly as good as those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Despite the difficult conditions on Antarctica and the remote location of Ridge A, construction costs for an observatory there that could match the Hubble telescope could be built at a fraction of the cost of sending Hubble into space. For several years, a second Giant Magellan Telescope in Antarctica has been proposed. Observatory Since January 2012, a small international observatory, the High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz (HEAT) telescope, has operated at Ridge A, jointly run by American and Australian researchers.

With no immediate family, and with personal disputes with many members of the Royal Society, no memorials were erected in his honour on the occasion of his death. On the occasion of the tercentenary of his death in 2003, several efforts were made to address this situation.  Carved Stone Memorials   Westminster Abbey  Inscription to Hooke in Westminster Abbey. Eddie Smith, former Undermaster and archivist at Westminster School of which Hooke was a member, worked tirelessly on Hooke's behalf to get him a small memorial in Westminster Abbey. The work took years but eventually in 2005 one was unveiled. The inscription reads \\"Robert Hooke 1703\\" and is carved from one of the black marble tiles in the floor beneath the Lantern, near the pulpit. This is appropriate as Hooke was responsible for the laying of this floor.  The Monument  Inscription to Hooke on The Monument, London. Hooke's name was omitted from the Monument to the Great Fire of London (known generally as just \\"The Monument\\"), erected to commemorate the Great Fire of London in 1666, as Sir Christopher Wren has generally been given credit for the design of this monument. The new inscription acknowledges Hooke‚Äôs role in the monument's development. As part of a project to improve the area around the pillar in 2007 it was possible to take a space in the paving for a large () carved stone. The stone was quarried at Caithness and made its long journey down to London to be carved at the workshop of Richard Kindersley. It can be seen from the entrance to the Monument Underground Station and is now included in sightseeing tours for tourists. The wording on the memorial was written by Dr. Allan Chapman.  St Paul's Cathedral  Inscription to Hooke in St. Paul's Cathedral. Hooke's memorial at St. Paul's Cathedral is on the wall in the crypt of the cathedral, next to the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren. The quotation around the edge is from Micrographia, Hooke's amazing book, published in 1665. At the bottom of the memorial is an engraved metal bookworm in brass and chrome, recessed into the stone surface. As the crypt is rather a dark place, a pale, ivory-coloured stone was chosen and the carved letters were painted with blue and brownish-red watercolour to make them more easily readable. The memorial was dedicated by the Dean of St. Paul's after a special Evensong.  Painted Memorials  Artist Rita Greer has created several new images of Hooke and donated them to various sites.  Gresham College, City of London  This portrait in oils is the first of a series of memorial portraits. It shows a list of Hooke's interests and skills. It now hangs in the hall at Gresham College in the City of London. Hooke was Professor of Geometry for many years at the original Gresham College, at the site where the NatWest Tower now stands.  Isle of Wight  This painting shows Hooke as a child on the Isle of Wight, holding the model boat he made, with the church of All Saints (where his father was curate) in the background and the river medina.  The Open University, Milton Keynes  This memorial painting now hangs in the Seminar Room of the Robert Hooke Science Building at the Open University in Milton Keynes. It shows Hooke concerned with minute objects and huge objects. The emphasis is on astronomy. It was unveiled in February 2009.  Willen Church near Milton Keynes  Church of St Mary Magdalene is Hooke's only remaining church, not far from the Open University. He designed it for Dr. Richard Busby, the first headmaster of Westminster School. The memorial painting shows the church in the background.  University of Oxford  This memorial was commissioned for the Master's office at the Department of Engineering Science of Oxford University in 2009. It shows a portrait of Robert Hooke as an engineer with a few of his inventions ‚Äì the universal joint, wheel barometer and pocket watch. Other features of his work are the spring, an optic and his microscope with open pages of his book Micrographia. He holds a chain to make a catenary arch. Through the window can be seen the Bodleian Library and the Sheldonian Theatre, linking him with Oxford where he was an undergraduate.

The magazine was the first Kurdish literary magazine in Syria and it was intended to publish it on a monthly basis, but its publication was interrupted several times. The first 23 issues were published between 15 May 1932 and the 27 September 1935. The issues number 24 - 26 appeared between 1 April 1934 and 18 August 1935. The remainder was published between April 1941 and August 1943, and the French, who governed Syria and Lebanon at the time, supported its publication. The 57th and last issue was released on 15 August 1943. The first 23 issues of the magazine were published in both the Latin and the Arabic alphabets, but from the 24th issue onward, only the Latin alphabet was used. The Kurdish alphabet, which was formulated by the publisher Jaladat Ali Badirkhan and also referred to as Hawar alphabet or the Badirkhan alphabet, was used to publish Hawar. The texts which were published emphasized the value of the Kurdish folklore for developing the Kurdish language and personal qualities. Hawar had its most subscribers in Syria and Iraq, but also Lebanon, Iran. Some educational institutions and libraries in Europe and the Middle East also subscribed to the Hawar magazine. Since 2006, the 15 May, the date of the first publication of Hawar in 1932, is celebrated as the Kurdish language day. Jeladet Ali Bedir Khan said of his purpose for the magazine: \\"Hawar is the voice of knowledge. Knowledge leads to personal reflection. A person who becomes aware of the inner-self desires freedom and happiness. Self-knowledge also leads to self- expression. This magazine will reflect those expressions in the Kurdish language\\".

Nichols found that upscale houses were harder to sell in Kansas than in Kansas City, Missouri, so he built the club to attract buyers.

The screenplay by Ronald Alexander is based on the 1959 novel Return to Peyton Place by Grace Metalious. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox and is a sequel to their earlier film Peyton Place (1957). The film's storyline centers on the life and loves of bestselling author Allison MacKenzie. She has followed in the footsteps of her mother Constance by having an affair with a married man, her publisher Lewis Jackman (Chandler). She goes on to publish a tell-all novel that fictionalizes the scandal, homicide, suicide, incest, and moral hypocrisy that belies the tranquil fa√ßade of her hometown. She is quickly criticized by friends, family, and neighbors as a result. Plot The film takes place some eight to ten years after the events of the original film. Allison MacKenzie receives a phone call from publisher Lewis Jackman, who shows interest in publishing her book, promising to turn her into a household name whose books are exclusively bestsellers. Allison is ecstatic after hearing the news. Her best friend Selena Cross, however, continues to receive a lot of criticism from the townspeople for her \\"shameful\\" past. Among these criticizing her is Mrs. Roberta Carter, an old- fashioned, domineering woman who is unhappy that her son Ted has a close bond with Selena. Later that day, Mrs. Carter is visited by her son, who is in town while visiting from Boston. He surprises her with the shocking news of his having impulsively married a former Italian fashion model, Raffaella. Mrs. Carter looks down on the foreigner and contacts Selena with the couple's news, with the hope that Selena will drive the couple apart. Selena sees through Mrs. Carter's scheme and refuses, angrily leaving and getting herself involved in a car accident. At the accident scene, young ski instructor Nils Larsen helps Selena, and although she initially treats him coldly, she feels attracted to him. Meanwhile, Constance reluctantly allows her daughter to visit New York for a meeting with her publisher, Lewis. Allison is unhappy when she finds out that he wants to make changes to her book, but she finally agrees to cooperate. Constance calls the next morning and discovers that Allison and Lewis have been working together all night, so she immediately suspects the worst. Back in Peyton Place, Raffaella threatens to ban Ted's mother from their life, if she continues to treat her horribly. Raffaella and Ted go skiing later that day, and Ted is surprised to see Selena with Nils. Selena finally agreed to date him after bumping into him several more times following the accident. During the following weeks, Allison spends her time promoting her book, doing TV talk shows and radio show interviews. She is slowly turned into a celebrity, and she is continually with Lewis. She is angry after their time together to discover that he is married, but after she receives the first copy of her book, she kisses him. The book soon becomes a commercial success due to its scandalous contents. In Peyton Place the book is heavily criticized by its townspeople. Constance is soon disappointed with Allison for allowing so many changes to be made during the book's editing process. Selena is disgusted by the way she is portrayed in the book. She loses her mind, as a result, and strikes Nils with a fireplace poker, having flashed back to her past trauma and confusing him with Lucas, her abuser. Meanwhile, Mike Rossi, principal of the local high school, husband of Constance and the only defender of Allison's book, risks being discharged by the head of the school board, Mrs. Carter, for refusing to remove Allison's book from the school library. At the Carter home, Ted confronts Raffaella about her quarrel with his mother. Realizing that Ted will never stand up to his mother, Raffaella reveals she is pregnant, before angrily leaving him. Determined, now, to terminate her pregnancy, she purposely causes a skiing accident to end it. When Allison finds out Mike has been fired, she decides to face the wrath of Peyton Place's residents. They are still incensed by their barely disguised fictional counterparts and her book's revelations of the town's many secrets. She is immediately confronted by her mother for having sold her decency and self-respect for success and money. Despite the quarrel with her mother, Allison decides to support Mike, who has taken his case of being fired directly to Peyton Place's town hall. Among the people defending Mike are Lewis, Nils, and Ted. Nils points out that the bigoted townspeople have now driven away Selena, who is nowhere to be found, revealing his hope to marry her if she ever returns to Peyton Place. Selena returns and blames the small-minded townspeople for making her feel ashamed, while thanking Allison for having written the truth about their hypocrisy. In the end Roberta is denounced and Mike is given back his job after Constance publicly points out that the older, bigoted townspeople have been manipulating the lives of their children for far too long. Afterwards, Allison, having emotionally matured and become an adult, breaks off her affair with Lewis, explaining that she does not want to ruin his marriage. She decides to leave Peyton Place to start a new life elsewhere.

Reception Critical reception Variety described the film as \\"a high-class soap opera\\" and added, \\"Jos√© Ferrer's direction of this material is deliberate, but restrained and perceptive... The lovely Lynley does a thoroughly capable job, although a shade more animation would have been desirable. But it is the veteran Astor who walks off with the picture\\".Variety review The New York Times praised Mary Astor, but wrote, \\"... the script of Ronald Alexander is simply shallow and diffuse, and the direction of Jos√© Ferrer does very little to improve on those qualities\\". TV Guide said, \\"the story and its themes tend to evolve to a predictable ending. Astor is marvelous in her role as the overbearing mother... and Weld, virtually unknown at the time, starred in a role that displayed her natural sex appeal\\".TV Guide review Robert Firsching of Allmovie said the film was \\"sillier than the original, adding to its problems by completely recasting all the roles, combining several of them into existing characters\\". Calling it \\"overwrought and overblown\\", he said \\"the film is still a treat for fans of campy 'suburban sin' melodramas\\".New York Times overview Box office The film grossed $9,996,178 in the US, far less than the $25,600,000 earned by its predecessor, but still a profit-earner for Fox.Peyton Place at TheNumbers.com See also * List of American films of 1961 References External links  Return to Peyton Place at Letterbox DVD *Review of film at Variety *Return to Peyton Place at BFI Category:1961 films Category:1961 drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American sequel films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Jos√© Ferrer Category:Films scored by Franz Waxman Category:Films set in fictional populated places Category:Films shot in Massachusetts ","title":"Return to Peyton Place (film)"},{"id":"24188685","text":"Roy Cross may refer to: * Roy Cross (footballer) (born 1947), English footballer * Roy Cross (artist) (born 1924), British artist ","title":"Roy Cross"},{"id":"24188697","text":"Christmas from the Heart may refer to: * Christmas from the Heart (David Archuleta album), a 2009 album * Christmas from the Heart (Kenny Rogers album), a 1998 album See also * Christmas in the Heart, a 2009 album by Bob Dylan ","title":"Christmas from the Heart"},{"id":"24188725","text":"Charlotte Barnes may refer to: * Charlotte Mary Sanford Barnes (1818‚Äì1863), American actress and playwright * A character from the film Bandslam ","title":"Charlotte Barnes"},{"id":"24188730","text":"Roy Cross (born 23 April 1924) RSMA GAvA is a British artist and aviation journalist best known as the painter of artwork used on Airfix kits from the 1960s.

It is a well-preserved hillfort overlooking the Dee Estuary. Excavations in the early 1970s revealed a sequence of defensive structures made of timber and several phases of building work inside the ramparts. The hillfort Excavations suggest that the site was occupied, perhaps sporadically, from the Neolithic period to sometime before the Roman conquest of the area. Remains of a timber long house on the hill summit have been dated to the third millennium BC and may represent the earliest human occupation of the region. Defensive construction at the site began around the late seventh century BC, and at first consisted of a timber palisade enclosing a settlement of timber roundhouses. The palisade was later replaced by a stone-and-earth rampart and a ditch. Much of the archaeological work at Moel y Gaer was carried out in the early 1970s, before the planned construction of a 500,000 gallon storage reservoir on the hilltop in 1979 destroyed a portion of the site. The excavations showed that there had been three phases of development within the ramparts. In phase one, rings of postholes showed where circular huts had stood, the doorways having two or four postholes outside the main ring. In phase two, the round huts were differently constructed, the roof resting on a wall of rammed stakes. Also in phase two were rectangular buildings, with four large posts at the corners, the huts laid out in neat rows in a formal layout. The site seems to have been abandoned after this for a while, after which it was reoccupied, with the third phase construction of rectangular, sleeper-beam buildings, in a non-formal, scattered layout.

McNeil, \\"Madame Marie Knight\\", Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music, Psychology Press, 2005, pp.221-223 - but she grew up in Newark, New Jersey. Her father was a construction worker and the family were members of the Church of God in Christ. She first toured as a singer in 1939 with Frances Robinson, an evangelist. She married preacher Albert Knight in 1941 but the union ended in divorce. While she was touring with Sister Rosetta in the 1940s, her two children died in a fire at her mother's house in New Jersey. In 1946, she made her first recordings, for Haven Records with the masters soon purchased by Signature Records, as a member of The Sunset Four (aka The Sunset Jubilee Singers). Shortly afterwards, Sister Rosetta Tharpe saw her singing at the Golden Gate Auditorium in Harlem, on a bill with Mahalia Jackson, and invited Knight to join her on tour. Tharpe recognized \\"something special\\" in Marie's contralto voice. She continued to record and perform with Tharpe through the 1940s, sometimes acting out the parts of \\"the Saint and the Sinner\\", with Tharpe as the saint and Knight as the sinner. Among their successes were the songs \\"Beams of Heaven\\", \\"Didn't it Rain\\", and \\"Up Above My Head\\", recorded for Decca Records. \\"Up Above My Head\\", credited jointly to both singers, reached No. 6 on the US R&B; chart at the end of 1948, and Knight's solo version of \\"Gospel Train\\" reached No. 9 on the R&B; chart in 1949.Joel Whitburn, She left Tharpe to go solo around 1951, and put together a backing group, The Millionaires (Thomasina Stewart, Eleonore King and Roberta Jones), with whom she recorded the 1956 album Songs of the Gospel. She began recording secular R&B; music in the late 1950s, for various labels including Decca, Mercury, and Okeh. Her duet with Rex Garvin, credited as Marie & Rex, \\"I Can't Sit Down\\" released on the Carlton label, reached No. 94 on the pop chart in 1959.Whitburn, Top Pop Singles 1955-2002, Billboard, 2003; , p. 440Rex Garvin profile, rockabilly.nl; accessed December 13, 2015.

In 1961 she recorded the single \\"Come Tomorrow\\", which was later a hit for Manfred Mann.Richie Unterberger, [ Marie Knight] at Allmusic Knight's version of \\"Cry Me a River\\" reached No. 35 on the U.S. Billboard R&B; charts in 1965.[ Charts], Allmusic; accessed December 13, 2015. She toured with Brook Benton, the Drifters, and Clyde McPhatter, and regularly reunited onstage with Tharpe. She remained friends with Tharpe, and helped arrange her funeral in 1973. In 1975, having given up performing secular music, she recorded another gospel album, Marie Knight: Today. In 2002, Knight made a comeback in the gospel world, recording for a tribute album to Tharpe. She released a full-length album, Let Us Get Together, on her manager's label in 2007. Death Marie Knight died in Harlem of complications from pneumonia, on August 30, 2009, aged 89. She was survived by a sister, Bernice Henry.

According to the 2011 Nepal census, Bahun is the second most populous group after Chhetri in Nepal. According to 1854 Muluki Ain (Nepalese Legal Code), Bahuns were regarded as caste among sacred thread bearers (Tagadhari) and twice-born Hindus. A Bahun (Brahmin) man at the Bratabandha ceremony in Nepal  Originhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Nepal/The-people Traditionally, Bahuns were members of the Khas community together with Chhetris (Khas Kshatriyas). Possibly due to political power of the Khasa Malla kingdom, Khas Bahun and Khas Rajput (Chhetris) had high social status as indigenous plain Brahmins and Rajputs in the present-day western Nepal. Bahuns, regarded as upper class Khas group together with Chhetri, were associated mostly with the Gorkha Kingdom. Bahun (with Chhetri) are referred with tribal designation of Khas in most of the context than lower occupational castes like Kami, Sarki etc. Clans Bahuns were divided into two clans on the basis of residency. The Bahun residents east of Mahakali river were known as Purbiya Bahun and west of the river were known as Kumai Bahun. Kumai or Kumain is a direct derivative of Kumaoni, meaning residents of Kumaon. Demography According to the 2011 Nepal census, Bahuns (referred as Hill-Brahmin) are the second most populous group after Chhetri with 12.2% of Nepal's population (or 32,26,903 people). Bahun are the second largest Hindu group with a population of 3,212,704 (99.6% of Bahuns). Bahuns are the largest group in 15 districts in Nepal: Jhapa, Morang, Kathmandu, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Rupandehi, Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, Gulmi and Arghakhanchi. Among these, Bahuns in Parbat (35.7%), Arghakhanchi (32.8%), Syangja (30.9%), Chitwan (28.6%), Kaski (27.8%) and Gulmi (25.2%) consist more than 25% of the district population. Kathmandu has largest Bahun population with 410,126 people (23.5%). Bahuns have the highest civil service representation with 39.2% of Nepal's bureaucracy while having only 12.1% of Nepal's total population. The civil service representation to population ratio is 3.2 times for Bahuns which is fourth in Nepal. Chhetris represent 5.6 times in civil services to their percentage of population, which is the highest in Nepal. As per the Public Service Commission, Brahmins (33.3%) and Chhetris (20.01%) were two largest caste group to obtain governmental jobs in F.Y. 2017-18 even though 45% governmental seats are reserved for women, Madhesis, lower caste and tribes, people with disability and those from the backward regions.https://kathmandupost.com/miscellaneous/2018/10/16/brahmins-and- chhetris-land-most-government-jobs Similarly, in the fiscal 2018‚Äì19, Bahuns (34.87%) and Chhetris (19.63%) maintained 55% of their proportion in civil service as per Public Service Commission.https://kathmandupost.com/national/2019/11/12/brahmins-and- chhetris-continue-to-dominate-entry-into-civil-service Brahmanbaad  Bahunbaad along with Bahun-Chhetri phenomenon has been dubbed as sociopolitical dominance of Khas-Pahades in Nepal. This dominance has emerged a critical condition for Bahun and Chhetri males for depriving of opportunities due to quota and reservation for other castes. Former Prime Minister of Nepal, Baburam Bhattarai, also a Bahun, had argued that Khas Arya dominate 80% institutions in Nepal and meritocratic system should not be introduced in Nepal. Opposingly, it is widely known that the Bahun-Chhetri dominance was based on formal legal system and the guilt of state capture is targeted by quota-reservation supporters. The European Union mission in Kathmandu also suggested the Nepalese government to deny Khas Aryas their proportional representation election quota.

These droughts are usually during the summer, when a blocking high causes hot, dry weather for an extended period. {dead link} However this means that droughts can vary in their characteristics. All types of drought cause issues across all sectors, with impacts extending to the ecosystem, agriculture and the economy of the whole country in severe cases of drought. The south east of the country usually suffers most, as it has the highest population (and therefore demand) and the lowest average precipitation per year, which is even lower in a drought. Even in these areas in severe droughts, the definition, impacts, effects and management are all minimal in comparison to drought prone areas such as Australia and parts of the United States. In recent years however, the summers of 2007, 2008, 2009, August 2010 and 2012 were wetter than normal, 2007 being wettest on record. , according to the Environment Agency, due to the impact of climate change, England's anticipated demand for water will exceed its supply around the year 2045. Definition and comparison with other countries A drought is usually defined as an extended period of weather (usually around 3 weeks) when less than a third of the usual precipitation falls. In the United Kingdom an absolute drought is currently defined \\"as a period of at least 15 consecutive days when there is less than 0.2 mm (0.008 inches) of rainfall\\", although before the 1990s a drought was defined as \\"15 consecutive days with less than 0.25 mm (0.01 inches) rain on any one day\\". This previous definition sometimes led to confusion, as many argued, \\"if less than 0.25 mm of rain each day fell in 30 days, is that 2 droughts? And if 0.26 mm fell after 25 days, is the drought over?\\" This led to the new definition, but many believe hindsight is the best way to judge if a drought has occurred. In the longer term, drought in the United Kingdom can also be defined as \\"a 50% deficit over three months, or a 15% shortfall over two years\\". Compared to other countries, the United Kingdom definition of a drought is much less severe. In Libya in the Sahel region, a drought is usually only recognized after two years without any measurable rainfall. If this were to happen in the United Kingdom, the consequences would be disastrous. A different type of drought is the hydrological or agricultural drought. In this case there is moisture in the soil, but little is getting to vegetation, either because it is frozen (which can occur in severely cold winters in the United Kingdom) or because of very high temperatures which mean that the rate of evapotranspiration exceeds the rate of uptake of water from the plant (which can be seen in the United Kingdom, on hot days, when plants wilt as their stores of water are depleted). A hydrological drought can occur after a relatively dry winter, when the soil moisture storage, reservoirs and water table have not risen enough to counteract the warm summer weather. These sorts of conditions can persist over several years, even with above average rainfall, as the rainfall only slowly percolates through the water stores and replenishes them. Causes The main cause for a long spell of dry weather in the United Kingdom is usually a blocking anticyclone (often the Azores high) system that forces other low pressure systems around it, usually to the northwest. This can happen any time of year, but brings hot sunny weather in summer and dry, cold and foggy weather in winter. This is why in dry spells the northwest of the United Kingdom actually often receives above average rainfall, as depressions and associated fronts are pushed towards the north. A severe drought in the United Kingdom needs to have the high pressure in charge of the weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or even months at a time. Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or even months at a time, allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the anticyclonic system. , according to the Environment Agency, due to the impact of Climate Change, England's anticipated demand for water will exceed its supply around the year 2045. Notable events Several notable droughts in the United Kingdom have occurred in recorded history, some of these in the 21st century. They can be divided into two categories, the meteorological drought where little or no rain fell over a relatively short period and the hydrological drought, where below average rainfall has occurred over an extended period.  Meteorological droughts  One of the most severe meteorological droughts in recent times was in 1976, when a dry 1975-76 winter was followed by one of the hottest and driest summers since records began. The drought effectively began in October 1975, but with low temperatures and therefore low evaporation rates during the winter, the below average rainfall did not present an immediate problem. As the dry winter ended and was followed by the hot and particularly dry summer of 1976, the drought became one of the most famous in United Kingdom history. The drought became a serious problem in late spring. In April, no rain fell in parts of Cornwall; and then in June, no rain fell over Devon and Kent. In August no precipitation was measured in North Wales. This meant that in some places, less than half the average rainfall was measured from October 1975 to August 1976. For example, in Kew, just 235 mm (9.25 inches) of rain was measured over that period, which was 43% of the average, meaning the amount of rainfall was comparable to a semi-arid climate. In Devon and Dorset, some locations received no rainfall for 45 consecutive days through July and August, another United Kingdom record. This was on top of another three periods of absolute drought, totalling 58 days with no measurable precipitation. The lack of rain can be attributed to the high pressure system over the United Kingdom at the time, which meant average pressure was 5 millibars above the expected for the summer months. This drought was intensified by the exceptional heat that continued through it. Records were set for the heat as well as the lack of rain, resulting in very high evaporation rates. From 23 June, temperatures were over for two consecutive weeks around the United Kingdom, peaking at on 28 June at Mayflower Park in Southampton. The highest temperature in the summer was at Cheltenham on 3 July. The effects of the drought included substantial and long-lasting changes to the tree composition of forests. The European Beech was severely affected by the drought and took around twenty years to recover. To date, its growth has failed to recover completely, reaching only about 75% of their pre-drought growth rates, even decades after the drought. Additionally, death due to drought resulted in the loss of around 15% of the mature beech trees in the forest. In contrast, the sessile oak did not suffer any death or growth suppression due to drought, but instead benefited from reduced competition with beech. Sessile oak growth increased suddenly after the drought and remained unusually high until the 1990s, when beech recovered and regained dominance. European Beech dominates temperate forests over large areas of Europe, but is considered to be particularly drought-sensitive and is predicted to be outcompeted by more drought-tolerant species in many regions as the climate warms. Another event like the 1976 drought was in the summer of 2003. This was also notable for the temperatures, with being hit in the United Kingdom for the first time since records began, with a top temperature of recorded in Faversham, Kent, and some places recording up to, or above, unofficially. This drought and the associated heat wave affected the whole of Europe, not just the United Kingdom, as with the 1976 event. The average temperature was the highest since 1868, measured over February to September. This added to the severity of the drought, with high rates of evaporation. The summer ranked as the 4th highest for potential evaporation since 1961, and this evaporation alone exceeded rainfall totals across a third of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom had its driest February to October period since 1921, and in the drought period had conditions only comparable to the previous conditions of 1976. Over the whole of the United Kingdom, the rainfall totals were the 3rd lowest since records began in 1900, and in some regions only 25% of the average rainfall fell in this period. Scotland suffered during this period as it had its driest spell since the 1955 drought, and coupled with a dry winter here (England and Wales had relatively wet winters as depressions were forced south) this led to a hydrological drought here too. Also, with several local convective thunderstorms missing specific areas, some localities had exceptionally low rainfall totals, compared to the average, with some places having their driest February to October since 1697. The drought ended in October when a low pressure system finally arrived to bring substantial rain to the United Kingdom. Some areas in Southern England had more rain in this 6 day period than they had received in the previous 3 months. Fortunately the preceding winter of 2002-2003 was relatively wet, which reduced the severity of the drought greatly, unlike the dry 1975-76 winter which led into 1976. Hydrological droughts A significant hydrological drought occurred in the United Kingdom between 1995 and 1998, when the warm, dry summers were followed by dry, cool winters. This meant that over the three years, the lack of winter precipitation failed to counteract the dry summers, so slowly the water table fell, and reservoir water levels began to fall. Water levels were only replenished after some exceptionally wet years from 1999 to 2002. Similar conditions were felt between 2003 and 2006, with only the record breaking rainfall of 2007 and 2008 replenishing the water levels. Impact United Kingdom droughts have similar consequences to other droughts elsewhere in the world. The first of these is river and reservoir levels begin to drop as rainfall fails to counteract evaporation. As drought conditions continue, groundwater levels drop and this provides excellent conditions for fires to develop. With hot, dry weather and no moisture underground, trees lose moisture and become very flammable in dry conditions. This leads to wildfires which usually is the main impact of drought in the United Kingdom, with moorland vegetation such as heather badly affected as the peat bogs dry out. Also, these fires can continue, even when seemingly put out, as the smoldering peat re-ignites the dry vegetation. However, during severe droughts, many trees can burn, and people's lives can be at risk, as in the 1976 drought when a fire encroached on a hospital, and only a wind direction change saved the patients' lives. As embers can be transported easily, and if drought is severe enough, fires can start miles away from their original position as they are transported by wind and even dust devils. With these situations, roads are often closed to prevent loss of life and further damage. These fires also can destroy wildlife habitats, and this can also threaten wildlife. Often, in severe droughts, crops can fail as the soil does not contain sufficient moisture to keep them alive and this is usually the largest economic impact with ¬£500 million ($830 million) worth of damage from failed crops in 1976. Another, more subtle impact is the insurance claims from damage to houses and businesses from fire and subsidence (caused by the dry and shrunken soil), sometimes amounting to over ¬£50 million ($83 million) in severe droughts. Responses and management The responses to drought in England are managed by the Environment Agency. There are four stages to drought management, applying to both businesses and homes. The first of these is a media campaign, urging people to save water and thus avoid the need to take specific measures. For example, use a water butt to collect any rainfall. If drought continues, and water levels continue to decrease, further measures are brought in to save water. This includes a hosepipe ban, which forbids the use of hosepipes, and can be applied to hot tubs, pressure washers and other similar devices in a future drought. These measures were brought in, particularly the ban on hosepipes, in 1976 and 2006. The third stage involves conserving any non- essential supplies of water. These measures are brought in when no precipitation is forecast and water supplies are already very low. The options include: * widening the hosepipe bans, to include sprinklers, * drastic measures such as banning cleaning of buildings, vehicles and windows or the filling of swimming pools. These measures were also brought in during the 1976 drought. The fourth and final stage involves drastic measures of water rationing to all businesses and homes in the United Kingdom in an emergency drought order. The measures are brought in only in exceptional conditions of extended periods with little or no rainfall. This means no water supplies at certain times of the day, or allowing water for a specific amount of time. Standpipes and water tankers can be used as a last resort to have only set amounts of water given to each household in a neighbourhood. Again, these measures were used during the 1976 drought. Also, each area in the United Kingdom has its own drought plan, for the event of any future drought.

It has been released by the Bioinformatics Resource Unit of the Life Sciences Institute (LSI), National University of Singapore (NUS) and is bootable from any PC that allows a CD/DVD or USB boot option and runs the compressed Slackware flavour of the Linux Operating System (OS), also known as Slax. Slax was created by Tom√°≈° Matƒõj√≠ƒçek in the Czech Republic using the Linux Live Scripts which he also developed. The BioSLAX derivative was created by Mark De Silva, Lim Kuan Siong and Tan Tin Wee. BioSLAX was first released to the NUS Life Science Curriculum in April 2006. History In January 2003, APBioNet received a research grant from the Pan Asia Networking (PAN) Programme of IDRC (Canada) to build an APBioBox of commonly used bioinformatics applications and packages with grid- computing software as part of its effort to build an APBioGrid. The platform chosen was the then ubiquitous Redhat Linux. In March of that same year, APBioNet launched an industry partnership scheme (AIPS) and partnered with Sun Microsystems to build BioBox for the Solaris platform. Six months later, beta versions of APBioBox and Sun's biobox, now called Bio-Cluster Grid were released for beta testing among selected parties. The packages included Globus Grid Toolkit Version 2.0 and Sun Grid Engine respectively. On 4 December 2003, the biobox software packages now named APBioBox (Redhat Linux) and BioCluster Grid (Sun Solaris) were field-tested at a Bioinformatics Workshop was conducted at the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Philippines on the occasion of the 70th Anniversary of the National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP). Ten pentium machines and a couple of Sun servers were successfully inducted into the APBioGrid. This Workshop and the software tested were sponsored by Sun Microsystems and partially funded by IDRC. In July 2004, Dr Derek Kiong introduced Knoppix as a stable, powerful and small-footprint Unix (Debian- based) platform to A/Prof Tan Tin Wee in a workshop organised by the Institute of Systems Science (ISS), NUS. By September 2004, through Mr Ong Guan Sin, we were able to create a Knoppix remaster template by building software in APBioBox plus useful applications into a prototype, APBioKnoppix, as a project for the practical course of LSM2104 module of the Dept of Biochemistry, NUS. It was subsequently upgraded based on Knoppix 4.02 and released as APBioKnoppix2. While APBioKnoppix was widely used, it was found that it was not easily expandable. All applications had to be in place prior to remastering and this made the distribution highly inflexible. In June 2005, Mr. Mark De Silva of the Bioinformatics Resource Unit of the Life Sciences Institute (LSI), suggested using Slax as a base for a new bio-based live CD due to its modular system, which effectively allowed for the same base system to be used and various tools or changes to be included on top of the base easily by adding single modules with all the application files or changes. This eliminated the need to remaster the entire system every time new software or changes emerged, which was the case for Knoppix. By April 2006, the first version of BioSLAX was released with several editions: * Standard User Edition (530 MBytes) * Developer Edition (700 MBytes) * Sever Edition (470 MBytes) BioSLAX was subsequently used in the bioinformatics teaching module within NUS under the Life Science Curriculum as well as in several events that were organized under the umbrella of the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet). APBioNet is a regional affiliate of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). Customized versions were built to cater for both NUS and APBioNet. In August 2007, in collaboration with the APBioNet, a customized BioSLAX was used to set up the Bioinformatics Resource Node of Vietnam at Bio-IBT, the Bioinformatics Resource Server of the Institute of Biotechnology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Viet Nam. The Bio-IBT node offered : * BioMirrors repository of biological databases * NCBI BLAST mirrored resource * Web access to EBI EMBOSS applications * Web access to CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment * Web access to the T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment * Web access to the PHYLIP Phylogenetic Inference Package * Web access to the Sequence Manipulation Suite, SMS2 Users with SSH access to the server also had access to many more command line based bio/life science applications. The entire project was done in collaboration with the 1st UNESCO-IUBMB-FAOBMB-APBioNet Bioinformatics Workshop in Vietnam, held 2031 August 2007, a satellite event of the 6th International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB) 2007 at HongKong, Hanoi and Nansha. Some versions of BioSLAX deployed in international institutions under APBioNet were fitted with a small tool which allowed them to map their IPs to a dynamically created apbionet.org domain name, hence giving each machine a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and presence on the Internet. Modularity Because Slax worked by overlaying \\"application modules\\" on top of the base Linux OS, it made the entire distribution modular. The additional functionality of deploying these modules even while the system was already running, made using Slax even more appealing. The inclusion of the GUI based \\"BioSLAX Module Manager\\", made this process of dynamically adding and removing modules even easier. Users were able to test updates to software or new versions and \\"rollback\\" to previous versions if they want. This was especially effective if SLAX/BioSLAX was installed to a writable medium such as a USB drive. BioSLAX Module Manager Versions To date, there have been two versions of BioSLAX - BioSLAX 5.x based on Slax 5 and BioSLAX 7.x based on Slax 6. While BioSLAX 5.x followed the version numbers of Slax 5, BioSLAX 7 adopted a new version numbering which is one higher than the Slax version on which it is based. Latest versions can be downloaded from the BioSLAX website. BioSLAX 5.x BioSLAX 5.x was largely based on the 5.1.8 version of Slax, running earlier versions of the 2.6 Linux kernel and KDE 3.4, with unionfs. BioSLAX 5.x editions =Standard User Edition= This edition runs the KDE X Window GUI and comes with all the tools and application suites, but does not include any compiler tools nor the Linux kernel source code and headers. This is mainly suited for users who only need to use the tools and applications suites. It has a very small size, making it easy to download and particularly convenient for regions where internet bandwidth is an issue. =Developer Edition= This edition runs the KDE X Window GUI and comes with all the tools and application suites and also includes a full set of development and compiler tools and also including the Linux kernel source code and headers. This is edition is more for the power user, who, in addition to using the various tools and applications, might want to also compile new applications or create new application modules for BioSLAX. =Server Edition= This edition does not include any X Window GUI, compilation tools, Linux kernel source or kernel headers. It is primarily meant to be used as a remote server, where users have to either SSH in to use the command line applications or connect to the server via the web to access the available web-based portals to popular bio applications. =NUS LSM Edition= This edition is the Developer Edition, customized for use by the NUS Life Science Curriculum for the teaching of bioinformatics. =Taverna Edition= This edition is the Developer Edition which includes TaveRNA. The TaveRNA Project aims to provide a language and software tools to facilitate easy use of workflow and distributed compute technology. BioSLAX 7.x BioSLAX 7.x is based on Slax 6 and features the later releases of the 2.6 Linux kernel, KDE 3.5 and using aufs and lzma compression. The biggest change is the use of this version as either client or server. The distribution was also moved from CD to DVD, allowing for more applications to be introduced, which were previously left out of version 5.x due to space considerations. The ability to boot from a FAT or EXT formatted USB drive was also introduced in Slax 6, hence BioSLAX 7.x versions also had this feature, effectively enabling persistent file handling which are unavailable on the CD/DVD as they are not (re-)writable. BioSLAX 8 Versions of BioSLAX after 7.x have been delayed due to the base distribution's (Slax) developer, Tom√°≈° Matƒõj√≠ƒçek, refusing to move forward with a new version because of family commitments. However his primary reason for not moving forward was that he was waiting for Squash FS and LZMA to be integrated into the Linux kernel by default, instead of users needing to apply separate patches. As of kernel 2.6.38, the integration was finally done and this has prompted Tom√°≈° Matƒõj√≠ƒçek to look at a new version of Slax, which will therefore result in a new version of BioSLAX in the coming months. One can follow his thoughts on the new version of Slax on his blog. Features  Standard tools BioSLAX features the Linux Slackware 12.1 operating system with updated drivers for various network adapters including support for a large variety of wireless cards. It also has many useful basic tools and applications such as: * PERL (including BioPerl modules) * PHP * Apache 2 * MySQL * OpenOffice.org * KPDF Reader * Mozilla Firefox * Mozilla Thunderbird * gFTP * ProFTPd * Open SSH * Kopete Instant Messenger * VNC Viewer * Remote Desktop Services BioInformatics tools The bioinformatics tools and applications are subdivided into three main categories. Console apps * BLAST * BlastCL3 * BioGrep * ClustalW * EMBOSS * Genesplicer * GlimmerHMM * HMMER * Modeller * PamL * Phylip * Primer3 * R programming language & Bioconductor * T-Coffee Desktop apps * ACT * Artemis * ClustalX (GUI Based ClustalW) * JAligner * Jalview * jEMBOSS (Java EMBOSS Suite) * Jmol * NJPlot * Pymol * ReadSEQ * TreeView * Weka (machine learning) Web apps * Web BLAST * Web ClustalW * Web Phylip * Web T-Coffee * wEMBOSS (Web based EMBOSS suite) * Sequence Manipulation Suite (SMS) Installing to hard disk One of the more intriguing features of Slax-based distributions is how easy it is to convert the live OS into a full-fledged Linux system installed on the hard drive of any PC, which will take up roughly 3.5GBytes of space. A tool, written with the KDE Kommander toolkit called the \\"BioSLAX Installer\\" is provided for users to easily convert their live OS to a full Linux installation. By using modules to customize the distribution and then using the installer, users can do rapid deployment of fully installed customized clients. BioSLAX Installer Future plans  BioSLAX updates BioSLAX will be updated as newer Slackware (or Slax) versions are released. The tools and applications suites will also be monitored for significant changes and upgraded as necessary. Some tools may be removed to make way for other tools which can do the same thing but with added functionality and better efficiency. More web-based portals are being looked at, for example, portals to ReadSeq, Primer3 and Genesplicer are in the pipeline. Grid deployment The developers were also looking at integrating various Grid computing platforms with BioSLAX. Because BioSLAX can be booted up immediately from any CD/DVD/USB, it can be used as a rapidly deployable Grid-enabled Operating System. One such Grid platform was the Univa Grid platform. Using the Univa Grid MP agent, it was shown during GridAsia 2009 in a talk given by Tan Tin Wee, that the agent, once modularized on BioSLAX, can be used to Grid enable machines from any location as slave-nodes to a master-node located elsewhere, effectively creating a \\"global-wide grid\\". BioSLAX on the cloud In a proof-of-concept endeavour, the developers successfully deployed BioSLAX as instances on a pool of resources using both VMWare's ESXi and Citrix Xen's Hypervisors. Their aim was to effectively create a \\"BioSLAX CLOUD\\" where students and staff may instantiate any number BioSLAX servers dynamically for research and education (conduct bioinformatics practical labs by having students connect to the servers via suitable X Window clients such as X-Win32, VNC, Exceed and NoMachine NX) or deployed in such a manner which when used in conjunction with the UD Grid mpagent may be used to form a cluster for processing large jobs. The proof-of-concept was highly successful in being deployed for research and education for the Life Science Curriculum at NUS and in 2011, a number of the BioSLAX cloud instances, both on VMWare's vSphere and Citrix Xen servers, were used in the APBioNet project, BioDB100. The backend controls and automation were created and implemented using the various APIs for vSphere and Xen by Mr. Mark De Silva. Developers were also in talks with Amazon from 2009 to 2010 to deploy similar BioSLAX cloud images on Amazon's EC2, hoping to push some of their research and education machines over to Amazon, cutting costs on hardware. Discussions, however, fell through when it was clear that Amazon was not going to support full hardware virtualization which was required in order to run BioSLAX images on the cloud. Supporting only para-virtualizaion, in fact, is the stand of most commercial cloud providers using Citrix Xen hypervisors. Until the mind-set of these entities change, only private clouds running Citrix Xen hypervisors configured for full hardware virtualization or VMWare vSphere clouds will be the only clouds capable of running BioSLAX.

Time temperature indicators are commonly used on food, pharmaceutical, and medical products to indicate exposure to excessive temperature (and time at temperature). In contrast, a Temperature data logger measures and records the temperatures for a specified time period. The digital data can be downloaded and analyzed. Technology There are a large number of different time temperature indicators available in the market, based on different technologies. Some devices are based migration of dye through a filter paper, while others contain pouches with bacterial fluids that change color when certain time-temperature combinations have been reached. To the degree that these physical changes in the indicator match the degradation rate of the food, the indicator can help indicate probable food degradation. Digital Temperature data loggers are available to indicate the full temperature history of a shipment to help identify the time period that out-of-tolerance temperatures were encountered. This temperature history can be used to calculate the loss of shelf life or the likelihood of spoilage. These small recorders are also used to identify the time (and thus location) of a shipment when the problem occurred, which allows for corrective action. TTI's food industry Time-temperature indicators can be used on food products that are dependent on a controlled temperature environment. Certain technologies can also be used for frozen food and the cold chain. Benefits Surveys within the EU projects \\"Freshlabel\\" and \\"Chill-on\\" have shown a positive feedback by consumers to the use of TTIs on food products. As TTIs help assure the cool chain of food products, they are expected to reduce the amount of food waste, as well as reducing the number of foodborne illnesses. Regulation The World Health Organization regulates the use of TTIs for certain medical products. There is extensive regulation by the FDA on the use of TTIs on US seafood products.

The pararecuemen from the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing performed the 800-foot training jump The 410th Expeditionary Operations Group (410 EOG) is a provisional United States Air Force unit assigned to Air Combat Command. It is the operational flying component of the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing. It may be activated or inactivated at any time. The unit began as the 410th Operations Group in September 1991, when Strategic Air Command implemented the Objective Wing reorganization and assigned Operations Groups to its combat wings. It was the operational component of the 410th Wing at K. I. Sawyer AFB, Michigan until 1995 when that base closed as a result of the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) reductions in military installations. Overview The unit was known to be active in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, when it was activated by ACC to manage various strike assets of the Air National Guard; the Air Force Reserve; the British Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force to support a counter-SCUD mission in the western desert of Iraq. Elements of the 410 EOG were assigned to several air bases in Jordan to carry out its mission. The unit has also been known to be active in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Modern era The group was first activated on 1 September 1991 as the 410th Operations Group at K. I. Sawyer AFB when Strategic Air Command implemented the Objective Wing organization, and assumed operational responsibility for a B-52 Stratofortress squadron and assigned KC-135 tankers. Aircraft carried Tail Code \\"KI\\" after 1992. The group was inactivated 1995 when K. I Sawyer was closed by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). Activated by Air Combat Command in early 2003 especially for the Scud-hunting mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom and to support other special operations forces tasks in western Iraq. Unit was activated at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base, Jordan (also known as Shahid Muafaq Al-Salti Air Base), dubbed Azraq Air Base by the U.S. military. Fighting alongside their fully integrated special operations ground task forces, the 410 EOG's pilots, flying F-16C and A-10 aircraft, pursued enemy equipment, personnel, and high- value targets, including regime leadership. In total, the wing flew 9,651 fighter and attack hours in twenty-six days flying counter-tactical ballistic- missile missions and never left the special operations forces in western Iraq without air cover. Often flying in extremely hazardous conditions in and around Iraq, the wing's crews generated 2,547 sorties, providing around-the- clock, time-sensitive targeting, interdiction, OCA (offensive counterair), CAS (close air support), ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), NTISR (Non-Traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), and CSAR (combat search and rescue) missions deep within enemy territory. These missions were flown from bare bases with little supporting infrastructure and necessary logistics. The wing accurately employed more than 600 precision- guided munitions and expended a total of 800,000 pounds of weapons. In addition to eliminating TBM support equipment, the wing is credited with destroying aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery pieces, surface-to-air missile systems, ammunition supply dumps, radars, and enemy troops. The wing is also credited with the destruction of two Baath Party headquarters buildings in western and central Iraq. Although the wing was engaged in more than 200 troops-in-contact scenarios, there were no fratricide events. During OIF, 410th personnel supplied thirty F-16s, four HH-60s, four HC-130s, eight RAF GR.7 Harriers, and two PR.9 Canberras with 130,000 gallons of fuel per day for twenty-three days.

He previously played for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Canberra Raiders and the Sydney Roosters in the National Rugby League. He has also played for the Indigenous All Stars and Country NSW, and New South Wales State of Origin representative winger, and is an amateur boxer. Background Ferguson was born in Sydney, Australia on 20 March 1990. A nephew of Solomon Haumono and a cousin of Anthony Mundine, Ferguson is of Aboriginal descent from Wiradjuri people, and is eligible for the Indigenous All Stars. He played his junior rugby league at Wellington Cowboys and Earlwood Saints. NRL Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks left Ferguson was the 2009 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks season's top try scorer. He was just beaten by Jamal Idris as the rookie of the year at the 2009 Dally M Awards. Following a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave the Sharks if coach Ricky Stuart left, Ferguson also left the club at the end of 2010. Canberra Raiders Ferguson signed a 2-year deal to play with the Canberra Raiders starting from 2011. He was the Raiders top try-scorer for the season. Following his debut Origin game in 2013 Ferguson's league career took a highly publicised downward spiral following an indecent assault charge. Ferguson finished the 2013 Canberra Raiders season as the club's top try scorer. Sydney Roosters In May 2014, Ferguson signed with the Sydney Roosters, who beat out South Sydney Rabbitohs for his services. However, due to Ferguson's guilty verdict in his 2013 indecent assault charge, the NRL in late June 2014 rejected an application for him to join the Sydney Roosters for the remainder of the 2014 NRL season, meaning he had to wait until the 2015 season to play for his new club. As part of his rehabilitation, Ferguson completed a rugby league refereeing course. He was widely seen as the man to replace Sonny Bill Williams, who departed after the 2014 season. For the 2015 NRL season Ferguson's healthy form led to Wendell Sailor considering him \\"the second best buy of the season\\". Following the departure of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck from the Roosters, after 2015, Ferguson was anointed as the player to replace him at for the 2016 season. However, after just one game at fullback, he was moved back to the centres. Ferguson was part of The Eastern Suburbs team that qualified for the finals in 2017. In the qualifying final, Ferguson almost cost his side the game when he chose to bat the ball back into play when it was heading to the sideline enabling Brisbane winger Corey Oates to score a try and put Brisbane in front with minutes to play. Easts went on to win the game in the dying minutes thanks to a Latrell Mitchell try. In the preliminary final against North Queensland, Ferguson scored a try off a knock on from North Queensland player Justin O'Neill to make the score 16‚Äì12 with less than 15 minutes to play in the match and with Eastern Suburbs in control. In the next play from the restart Ferguson lost the ball after being hit in a good tackle by O'Neill, who had lost the ball moments earlier. In the following play North Queensland scored courtesy of Kyle Feldt and Easts never recovered losing the match 29‚Äì16 in a huge upset. On 4 July 2018, Ferguson signed a three-year contract to join Parramatta beginning in 2019. Ferguson rejected a similar offer by Newcastle and wanted a new contract with Eastern Suburbs but the club was only prepared to offer him a one-year deal. In round 25 of the 2018 season, Ferguson scored his 100th try against his future club from 2019 onwards, the Parramatta Eels. His final game for the Roosters was the 2018 NRL Grand Final, in which it was revealed that he had played the second half with a broken leg. Parramatta Eels Ferguson made his debut for Parramatta against Penrith in Round 1 of the 2019 season. Ferguson scored his first and second try for Parramatta the following week against arch rivals Canterbury in a 36‚Äì16 victory. In Round 5 against Canberra, Ferguson suffered a badly broken nose and bruised ribs in a 19‚Äì0 loss. Ferguson was subsequently ruled out of the following week and missed the club's 51‚Äì6 victory over Wests Tigers at the new Western Sydney Stadium. In Round 15 against Canberra, Ferguson scored 2 tries as Parramatta came from 16‚Äì0 down to win 22‚Äì16 at TIO Stadium in Darwin. On 25 July 2019, Ferguson was ruled out of action indefinitely as he had suffered an infection in his knee and required surgery. Ferguson was only expected to initially miss one match. It was reported that Ferguson also suffered a bad reaction to antibiotics. Parramatta coach Brad Arthur spoke to the media saying \\"His health is our No. 1 priority, We won‚Äôt play him until he is 100 per cent fit\\". After spending 7 weeks out of action, Ferguson returned to the Parramatta side for their round 24 match against the Brisbane Broncos which Brisbane won 17‚Äì16 in Golden Point extra-time at Suncorp Stadium. Ferguson scored a second half try in the defeat. At the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished in 5th place on the table and qualified for the finals. In the elimination final against Brisbane, Ferguson scored a try as Parramatta won the match 58‚Äì0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55‚Äì7 win over St George in 1944. The match was also Parramatta's biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988. On 30 September, Ferguson was named at wing for the Australia PM XIII side. In round 17 of the 2020 NRL season, Ferguson scored his first try of the year as Parramatta defeated the New Zealand Warriors 24-18 at the Central Coast Stadium. It was Ferguson's first try in nearly 12 months with his previous try coming against Brisbane in the 2019 elimination final. Representative career Ferguson representing the Prime Ministers XIII in 2011 All Stars In 2010, he was called up to play for the Indigenous All- Stars, replacing the injured Justin Hodges. In that match he famously ran down Israel Folau. Ferguson was previously managed by his uncle Solomon Haumono is now managed by Sam Ayoub. Country In 2012, Ferguson had one of his best seasons on the field, representing the Country New South Wales rugby league team. New South Wales In 2013, Ferguson made his debut for the New South Wales rugby league team in Game I of the 2013 State of Origin series. He had previously been approached by Queensland rugby league team coach Mal Meninga to play for Queensland. In the 2018 NRL season, Ferguson was not selected for the 2018 State of Origin series with coach Brad Fittler opting to select wingers Josh Addo-Carr and Tom Trbojevic instead. Fittler had publicly stated to the media before the team selection that NSW needed to change its \\"selfish culture\\". Despite Ferguson's strong 2018 form, the 28-year-old's non-selection was no great shock given the players infamous afternoon at a pub with Josh Dugan five days out from the 2017 series decider. After missing out on selection for New South Wales in 2018, Ferguson was selected for Game 2 of the 2019 State of Origin series which New South Wales would go on to win 38‚Äì6 at Optus Stadium in Perth. Ferguson was retained for Game 3 of the series which was played at ANZ Stadium in the deciding match. With 1 minute left of normal time and with the scores at 20‚Äì20, Ferguson made a break down the right-hand side of the field and beat the covering tackle of Corey Norman. Ferguson then passed to James Tedesco who crossed over for the series-winning try with 20 seconds of play left. Australia In 2012 he made the Australia train-on squad. On 6 May 2016, Ferguson made his international debut for Australia against New Zealand in the 2016 Anzac Test, scoring a try on debut. thumb Boxing Ferguson made his professional boxing debut on 27 November 2013 in a fight against Luke Turner. Personal life and controversies Blake has been disciplined for several incidents of off-field behaviour. At a music festival in November 2012, he was escorted by security staff out of a VIP area after reports that he had been spitting on patrons. The Raiders refused to answer specific questions about the incident but stated that \\"We are aware of the incident and Blake has been disciplined internally.\\" He was also fined for the NRL after breaking their drinking policy. Assault conviction On 17 June 2013, Ferguson was apprehended and charged by police for an alleged Indecent Assault at the Sutherland Shire nightclub 2230. On 6 September 2013 the Canberra Raiders sacked Ferguson.Sydney Morning Herald 06/09/2013. Retrieved 6 September 2013 On 11 December 2013, Ferguson was found guilty of June's indecent assault charge. Ferguson had pleaded not guilty arguing that he had mistaken the woman for 'another blonde woman' he had met earlier that evening at a different venue, 'Northies' but Ferguson was found guilty, placed on a good behaviour bond, and ordered to stay away from nightclubs and alcohol. He was also suspended from football for more than 2 years. He converted to Islam in 2013, after taking his shahada with his cousin, Mundine, who has been a Muslim for many years. He also briefly gave up alcohol. In December 2017, it was revealed that Ferguson had admitted himself into a rehabilitation centre to overcome a gambling addiction.

The series is about the adventures of 4 juvenile capoeira practitioners with the mission to protect the city of Nova Nizza from attack by mystical creatures from another dimension called \\"Divinos\\". The Combo Ni√±os have the ability to transform into mystical beings in animal form by touching one of the totems that appear on the creatures. This form gives them unique skills that serve them in the battle against the Divinos and to perform special attacks called Big Blastico, used to return a Divino back to its own dimension. Setting The series takes place in an environment similar to Latin American countries, but especially Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. This is evidenced by clothing, food, and names, as well as the use of the Capoeira style of fighting. Also, some characters play a sport called Novanoc that parodies the ancient game of the Mayans, the pok-ta-pok.  Characters  The children The children are the Combo 4, each of them being 11 years old: Serio, Paco, Azul and Pilar. * Serio: His totem is the Tigrillo. Serio is quiet, yet is quite charismatic. He likes poetry and art, but sometimes he does not like to admit it and does not boast of their abilities. He is funny and sarcastic, and he is secretly in love with Azul, but is afraid to declare his love. When he becomes the Tigrillo his skills are: speed, agility, and strength in his claws. * Paco: His totem is the Bull. Paco is competitive and tough, although at times he shows great pride and likes to show off, especially in his favorite sport, Novanoc. Paco becomes somewhat shy and has very bad temper when annoyed by something, and is occasionally foolish but is a very nice person and a good friend. When he becomes the Bull, Toro, his abilities are superhuman strength, capable of demolishing a building and cause waves sound clash, besides being very big. * Azul: Her totem is the Eagle. Azul is quiet and serious, likes fashion and is intuitive, but she becomes quite bossy. Azul has a device for the detection and location of the divine call DivinoBerry and battles. As the most intelligent, she plans how to stop and catch the Divinos. Azul doesn't know Serio likes her but, over time, she falls for him too. She has a phobia of insects and snakes (in the cases of Insecto Gigante and Mama Conda respectively). When turned into the Eagle, her skills are: Fly, cause powerful gusts of wind, bird control and produce high pitched sonic sounds. * Pilar: Her totem is the Iguana. Pilar is eccentric, cheerful, likes many strange things, including eating things like insects, seafood and even some plants, although her favorite food is frozen pistachio nuts and blackberries. Pilar is very different from the others, especially when dancing or playing instruments. Sometimes she becomes insecure. In addition to being innocent she is very easily distracted, even in battles, but still can occasionally have ideas that help in the battle, even if her plans seem somewhat crazy. When she becomes Iguana, her skills are elasticity in many parts of her body. The Masters The children are mentored in their activities by \\"The Masters\\". * Master Grinto is the teacher of the Combo Ni√±os in terms of capoeira and the fight against the Divinos. He was formerly a Combo boy himself; his totem is the Monkey. The children rely heavily on Grinto, especially in problems they have in their lives. He helps by encouraging them and showing them the right way, and usually always mentions the phrase \\"Don't you think? I think.\\" He works as a librarian at the school where they study. * Old Head is another combo Master of the children, and was formerly also a Combo and Grinto's teacher. His totem is Dragon Wing. Old Head is quite literally just a head, because while he coached Grinto in a battle against a Divinos, he ended up going to the Divino's world, and as punishment for being a teacher, his body was completely converted into a stone head. Yet he retains his life and supports Grint in training the Combo Ni√±os, although his character is somewhat rough and wants to impose the classical, or 'old- school' form of training. His real name is Bernie.  Divinos  The mystical creatures from another world that previously have been in the world of humans but caused chaos and disaster, until they were returned to their own world. Most of them seek conquest of the world of humans but are trapped in their world. Unfortunately, Diadoro's ambition has led them back to return to the world of humans, and although Diodorus wants them to follow his orders, they ignore him, though some are interested in helping him until it's time to break free and try again to conquer the world by themselves. The Divinos each display one of the Four totem symbols on their body that, when touched by the child with the corresponding animal, allows them to transform into their Animal Forms.  Other characters  * Diadoro was previously the mayor of Nova Nizza, but because of his lust for power, he ended up losing in the last elections. He looks for ways to oust the Mayor and regain his title, so, with the help of his assistant Gomez, look for portals where they can invoke the Divinos they need to oust the Mayor, but always ends up losing, because the Divinos often betray him and don't follow his orders. * Gomez is a scientist who knows where to locate all the portals of the Divinos and how to invoke them for help as ordered by his boss, Diadoro. He's always inventing gadgets to summon the Divinos, and also to try to control them, at which he always ultimately fails. Even if he is little more than a slave to Diodorus, Gomez always supports him. * Miss Solidad is the teacher of the school where the Combo Children study. She is quiet, nice and likes to teach children, even using some games and having fun with them, but is limited by Director Bronka because he thinks she does not teach the children properly. * Director Bronka is the director of the school. He is gruff and strict, insisting that the children are 'properly' educated, no matter what happens outside or how well teachers teach, especially with Miss Solidad. * Mayor Ruelas is the Mayor of Nova Nizza and almost every time Diadoro is defeated she finds a way to discredit him further than he already is. * Michael is a school boy and a fan of the Combo Ni√±os, even without knowing that his classmates are the Combos. * Millie is a school girl and Michael's greatest friend. She gets along very well with everyone and is cheerful. * Ralph is a school boy and even though he's in a wheelchair he is an excellent player of Novanok, and also makes pi√±atas. * Telmo is another companion of the Combo Ni√±os. He is Paco's great rival and buddy of Pearl. * Pearl is a school girl who is very rich. Believes she is the best and spends his days annoying everyone, especially Pilar, because she is jealous of her. Episodes  Production  Combo Ni√±os was produced by French animation studio SIP Animation, with animation work done by the Malaysian studio . The series was originally announced in October 2004, with delivery planned for the first quarter of 2006, and an expected budget of approximately US$370,000 per episode. At the time, the character of Diadoro was envisioned as a \\"down-on-his-luck e-trader\\".  Broadcast  Besides Jetix in Europe and Latin America, the series has also been broadcast on several other networks. * In Australia, since a Jetix Channel doesn't exist in the country, the show aired on free-to-air services Seven Network and 7TWO (which Disney had a partnership with Seven's parent company for many years). *In France, the series aired on TF1 (on the TFOU block) before Disney XD (Jetix France rebranded months after the show's premiere on the channel), due to the fact they co-produced the show. The show would premiere on Disney XD in December 2009. *In the United Kingdom, as well as Jetix, the series aired on the GMTV-owned (Which Disney held a 25% stake in at the time) Toonattik strand, which itself aired on ITV1 and CITV. *In Turkey, the show aired on Kanal D. *In the Middle East, the show aired on MBC 3, who aired other Jetix programming.  Reception  The series has been appraised as part of a well- needed fresh wave of television programming at the time. The concept of introducing young viewers to capoeira via an animated medium has been viewed positively, though some aspects were criticized as not ideal.

Biography Born in 1951 in Trier, Germany, he went on to collaborate closely in the 1970s with the artist Joseph Beuys, who was a key influence on his concept of photography, and thereafter with the French writer Herv√© Guibert (1955‚Äì91). He was director of the International Munich Theatre Festival from 1977 to 1983 and co-founder with Hans Werner Henze of the Munich Biennale music theatre festival. He also helped to set up AIDA, an international human rights watch group for artists. Since the late 1980s Berger has become increasingly involved in a series of long-term photography projects looking at dimensions of the world religions. He created extensive work on Theravada Buddhism, Shi'ite Islam, Catholicism and Taoism. In the city of Luang Prabang in Northern Laos, he founded the Buddhist Archive of Photography to digitize and preserve more than 35.000 historical photographs taken by the monks of Laos, and where his exhibition The Floating Buddha has been installed permanently at the monastery of Vat Khili. On the Island of Elba (Italy) he has been involved since 1977 with the restoration of the Eremo di Santa Caterina, a former Franciscan friary, as an arts centre, and the creation of a botanical garden dedicated to the spontaneous flora of the Tuscan Archipelago, the Orto dei Semplici Elbano, in 1994. At the monastery's medieval \\"Hortus Conclusus\\" he created a garden of ancient roses that over the years attracted a great number of artists, writers and gardeners from all corners of the world.

Returning to the Wests Tigers' NYC team, he played in the team that lost the Grand Final to Melbourne Storm, scoring a try in the second half. At the end of the season, Lui was named in the Toyota Cup Team of the Year. 2010 In March, Lui re-signed for the Wests Tigers to the end of the 2012 season, with coach Tim Sheens describing him as, \\"an integral part of the team.\\" Lui was named to start the season at halfback, but suffered an injury in round 2. Upon his return, in round 10, he scored his first try.

He primarily played in the back-row. He was described as, \\" one of the brightest prospects in the game\\" before a career-ending injury in 2011. Playing career Hailing from Macquarie Fields, Dwyer played junior football with the Ingleburn Bulldogs and Western Suburbs. Before his debut Royce Simmons described him as, \\"a big, strong back-rower, who plays on the right edge and hits a good line, has a good offload...\\" Impressing coach Tim Sheens with his two appearances in 2009, Dwyer was named in the first-grade squad for 2010. He was a regular in the first grade team in the second half of 2010, mostly starting on the bench. He was named the club's rookie of the year at the end of the season, and noted as \\"one of the most improved players in the NRL in 2010.\\" Before the end of the year, he signed a contract extension to remain with the Wests Tigers until the end of 2012. Dwyer received some recognition in the press for a tackle he made on Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in the 2010 qualifying final against the Sydney Roosters. It was described as \\"the best hit in a century\\", and received praise from noted defender David Gillespie. In 2011, Dwyer made his representative debut, playing for City Origin and scoring a try. He was also chosen to participate in a NSW developmental squad. Unfortunately, halfway through the season, Dwyer suffered a brachial plexus injury in a match against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, which saw him unable to play for the rest of the season. Some months later, full feeling had not returned to his right hand, and there was serious doubt as to whether he would be able to play again. Dwyer was de-registered by Wests Tigers and there was hope he would re-sign with them if he made a full recovery. Dwyer underwent surgery at the Royal North Shore Hospital, with nerves redirected from his diaphragm and scapula into his right shoulder and arm. As of 2012, the operation was deemed a success, and Dwyer hoped to return to rugby league in the future. Since the nerve redirection surgery and subsequent rehabilitation, it had become apparent that Dwyer will not regain functionality in his right arm. While he will not return to the football field, Dwyer does not allow his ailment to stop his positivity and drive to succeed in other areas of his life. Post playing In 2012, Dwyer was named as the assistant coach for the City Origin side, under head-coach Brad Fittler. As of 2018, Dwyer works with the Wests Tigers as a Performance Analyst.

He also served as acting director of the NHGRI Office of Policy, Planning and Communications. In 1996 the NHGRI had partnered with the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association to establish the National Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics (NCHPEG), a non-profit coalition that promotes professional education and access to information about advances in human genetics, operating from within the genome institute. Guttmacher directed the development of NCHPEG into a freestanding entity with 120 member organizations and its own executive director. In 1999 Guttmacher co-founded a group called \\"Genetic Resources On the Web (GROW)\\" which worked with organizations sponsoring genetics-related web sites to ensure they contain high-quality information. GROW's membership included more than 30 organizations, including health professional groups, patient-support groups, federal agencies, foundations, non-profit agencies, and for-profit companies.

Law enforcement is weak, corrupt and is reputedly connected to organised crime. It is estimated that there are 3,000 prostitutes in the capital Vilnius. Many of them are foreign, predominantly Russian, but there are also significant numbers from Belarus, Ukraine and Poland. Street prostitution, including underage prostitutes, is generally controlled by criminal elements. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. Legal situation Both prostitution itself and buying sex are prohibited by the Code of Administrative Offences. Related activities are prohibited by the Criminal Code. Public order laws are also used against prostitutes. Code of Administrative Offences Prostitution itself and the clients of prostitutes are criminalised by Article 1821 of the Administrative Code. The penalty is a fine of ‚Ç¨86 to ‚Ç¨144 for a single offence and ‚Ç¨144 to ‚Ç¨288 for repeat offences. Repeat offenders may also be subject to administrative arrest for up to thirty days Criminal Code The following are offences under the criminal code: : Article 307. Gaining Profit from Another Person‚Äôs Prostitution :: 1. Profit from another person‚Äôs prostitution or from procuration for prostitution (maximum sentence 4 years imprisonment) :: 2. Organises or is in charge of prostitution or transports a person with his consent for prostitution into or out of Lithuania (max 6 years) :: 3.

Observers estimate 40 percent of identified Lithuanian trafficking victims are women and girls subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Lithuanian women are also subjected to sex trafficking in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Vietnamese adults and children transiting through Lithuania may be trafficking victims. The approximately 4,000 boys and girls institutionalised in more than 95 orphanages are especially vulnerable to trafficking. Articles 147 and 157 of the criminal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties ranging from two to 12 years imprisonment. In March 2015, prosecutors announced an investigation into allegations that the director of an orphanage sexually exploited boys and operated a sex trafficking ring inside the institution, offering young boys to paedophiles. The investigation remained ongoing during the reporting period. In January 2015, prosecutors announced the investigation of a state-run residential institution for children with special needs; teenage residents allegedly had been subjecting girl residents to sex trafficking. The orphanage's director defended her institution by saying such activity is common at all Lithuanian orphanages. In March 2017, the court sentenced four men to two to four and a half years in jail for sex with juvenile residents of this orphanage and imposed one to three years probation sentences to four girls for facilitating prostitution. Prosecutors will appeal the decision asking the higher instance court to sentence the criminals for human trafficking.

He is particularly notable as the co-founder of the Downchild Blues BandCraig Harris, [ Biography of The Downchild Blues Band]; AllMusic. and was the original singer of that band's best-known songs. Biography With his older brother Donnie (\\"Mr. Downchild\\") Walsh, Richard \\"Hock\\"Richard Walsh had been known as \\"Hock\\" since childhood, being a short form for \\"hamhock\\", as referenced to Walsh's girth and the size of his arms. See Richard Flohill, Profile of Hock Walsh. Toronto Blues Society, 2000; www.torontobluessociety.com. Walsh co-founded the Downchild Blues Band in 1969, in Toronto. At the time, Downchild, as it later came to be known, was one of very few Canadian bands devoted to playing and developing blues music in Canada.Another Canadian band with a similar degree of devotion to blues music was Whiskey Howl, also formed in Toronto in 1969. Both Donnie and Hock Walsh were greatly popularized by comedian Dan Aykroyd, who developed the Blues Brothers based on what he had seen in the Walsh brothers. Aykroyd modeled Elwood Blues on Donnie Walsh, while John Belushi's Jake Blues character was modeled on Hock Walsh. In their first album as the Blues Brothers, Briefcase Full of Blues (1978), Aykroyd and Belushi featured three well-known Downchild songs closely associated with Hock Walsh's vocal style: \\"I've Got Everything I Need (Almost)\\", written by Donnie Walsh, \\"Shotgun Blues\\", co-written by Donnie and Hock Walsh, and \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\", co-written and originally popularized by Big Joe Turner.Jim Slotek, Bye to blues brother: Downchild's Donnie Walsh talks about late sibling , Jam! Music, February 4, 2000; www.jam.canoe.ca. All three songs were contained in Downchild's second album, Straight Up (1973). \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\" was Downchild's only hit single, and became the signature song of Hock Walsh. Despite being a co-founder of Downchild and closely identified with the band's sound, Hock Walsh would leave, rejoin and be replaced as lead singer in the band on several occasions. He was first fired from the band in 1974, shortly before work began on the band's third album, Dancin'. Hock rejoined the band in 1977 and 1985. He was fired by his brother Donnie for a final time in 1990. During his periods away from Downchild, Hock Walsh continued to play regularly. In 1978, he was a founding member of what would become the Cameo Blues Band, a legendary Toronto house band playing blues and rhythm and blues music at the Hotel Isabella. He was succeeded in the Cameo Blues Band by Tony Flaim and, later, Chuck Jackson, both of whom would also succeed him in Downchild.John Dickie, Profile of the Cameo Blues Band , based on conversation with Ray Harrison; www.makeitreal records.com. The last time the Donnie and Hock Walsh saw each other was eighteen months before the death of Hock Walsh, when Hock jammed with Downchild at an Etobicoke club. When asked whether this involved a reconciliation between the brothers, letting bygones be bygones, Donnie Walsh replied, \\"There are no bygones. We just don't have anything in common, really.\\" Hock Walsh died on December 31, 1999, at the age of 51, of an apparent heart attack. He had been scheduled to perform a New Year's Eve concert with blues singer Rita Chiarelli.Richard Flohill, Profile of Hock Walsh. Toronto Blues Society, 2000, as originally published in The Globe and Mail, www.torontobluessociety.com.

See Big Daddy G (Dave Glover) MySpace Page. Not to be confused with music producer Gary H. Mason, also known as \\"Big Daddy G\\". It was Glover who is considered to have been instrumental in bringing Hock Walsh out of semi-retirement in 1998. Eliciting the help of drummer Bruce Brooker, who was able to track Richard down while he was recovering from a car accident, Glover was able to schedule Hock into the studio for his contribution to 4-Blues.: see Wayne Deadder, Tribute to Big Daddy G; Toronto Blues Society, \\"Loose Blues News\\", March 2009; www.torontobluessociety.com. Glover was killed in a car accident, February 20, 2009; see www.bigdaddyg.ca. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. On February 6, 2000, a benefit concert in tribute to Hock Walsh was held in Toronto,Bobby Dean Blackburn, Remembering Hock; www.torontobluessociety.com. with proceeds to provide educational support for Hock's son. Among those appearing at the benefit were Big Daddy G, Gordie Johnson of Big Sugar,Johnson's first professional engagement had been as a member of Hock Walsh's band: see Bobby Dean Blackburn, Remembering Hock; www.torontobluessociety.com. the Downchild Blues Band and former Downchild vocalist Tony Flaim.Tony Flaim, the initial replacement for Hock Walsh in Downchild and featured on six of the band's albums, also died of a heart attack, on March 10, 2000, at the age of 52, less than three months after Hock Walsh and barely a month after appearing at the Hock Walsh tribute concert. In addition, Flaim's last recordings, as was the case with Hock Walsh, were for releases by Dave \\"Big Daddy G\\" Glover.

Tributes :Some people have had so much character when they were alive that they linger on in memories and, sometimes if we're lucky, in song by imitation.

In 1960, after high school, he briefly studied for the priesthood before getting involved full-time in social activism through a wide variety of different causes. Kessler founded and directed Project Appalachia, an anti- poverty program, from 1966-1968. The Meals on Wheels program he started in McKees Rock, Pennsylvania, still operates today. As co-founder and director of Pittsburgh's Thomas Merton Center from 1970-1973, he took an active role in the civil rights, anti-poverty, and anti-war movements. Kessler continued his activism at Boston's Paulist Center from 1973-1979, where he expanded the Walk for Hunger into the year-round anti-hunger program, Project Bread. During Boston's desegregation crisis in 1974, Kessler served as a bus monitor to help Boston kids get to school safely. AIDS Action Committee While running a successful business in 1982, Kessler first heard about the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

After being captured by the Qianlong Emperor, she initially agrees to be his concubine on the condition that he spares Chen and the Red Flower Society. However, when she discovers that the emperor is going back on his word, she commits suicide to warn Chen and the heroes. This character is based on the Fragrant Concubine. * The Qianlong Emperor () is the ruler of the Qing Empire. He is actually Chen Jialuo's elder brother. Shortly after he was born, he switched places with the Yongzheng Emperor's daughter and was raised as a prince before eventually inheriting the throne.

At the same time, Yu Yutong is also aware that Li Yuanzhi has romantic feelings for him but he has been treating her coldly all this while because he still maintains his crush on Luo Bing. In the middle of the novel, he feels guilty for having hurt both Luo Bing and Li Yuanzhi emotionally, so he becomes a Buddhist monk to escape from the vicissitudes of life.

To evade from his enemies, he disguises himself as a scholar and becomes a private tutor to Li Yuanzhi. By chance, Li discovers his skill in dart-throwing and learns that he is actually a Wudang swordsman. He agrees to teach Li martial arts after she keeps pestering him.

The text was initially published on May 1, 2009 by Harvard University Press. Posner criticizes President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis,Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-140, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311. and moves away from his past well-known advocacy of free-market capitalism. The book has been primarily noted not for his criticism of progressive government policies (which he attacks again for good measure), but rather his critique of laissez-faire capitalism and its ideologues. The book has been received with generally good reviews from the press, including The New York Times, but the reception has not been universally positive. Synopsis The primary argument of the book is that we have gone from a recession into a depression (the \\"D\\" word, as one author calls it) in 2009, and Posner suggests several possible short-term and long- term solutions to this fiscal crisis. His thesis is not that government, politicians, or even bankers primarily caused this depression, but rather that the capitalist system is to blame for its own faults.\\"Seven questions for Richard Posner,\\" Interview with Richard Posner, The Economist, 6 June 2009, found at The Economist website. Accessed September 8, 2009. Some of the causes of the depression that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable usury laws, which would discourage risky loans,Posner, p. 291. the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and central banks taking risks,Posner, pp. 45-46, 130. securitization of mortgages,Posner, p. 53. illiquidity and insolvency of the banking system,Posner, pp. 41, 63-70, 128, 133, 201 et seq. the housing bubble,Posner, pp. 77-78. blindness to warning signs of a crisis,Posner, pp. 118-138. and the preconceptions of ideology.Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316. Posner wraps up the book with a chapter containing several suggestions, including eventual re-regulation of the banking industry,Posner, pp. 289-291. but warns that \\"this is not the time\\" to do so ‚Äî a long-term solution after the economy recoversPosner, p. 291, see also pp. 291, 283-296. ‚Äî that can \\"wait calmer days.\\"Posner, p. 303. He also suggests putting off reorganization of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve until a later time.Posner, pp. 291-293, 302-303. In the meanwhile, he writes, \\"piecemeal reforms may be feasible and helpful.\\"Posner, p. 296. These include a halt on government marketing of home ownership, requiring banks and financial institutions to \\"disclose the full compensation of all senior executives\\",(Emphasis in the text) Posner, p. 298. backloading of compensation,Posner, pp. 299-300. increasing marginal income tax rates on the highest incomes,Posner, pp. 300-301. and usury laws to discourage risky loans. Criticism of George W. Bush The book is significant in Posner's criticism of President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis.Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-141, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311 Part of the shock is due to Posner's longtime \\"conservative\\" views. Judge Posner was nominated to the Seventh Circuit by Ronald Reagan, but is \\"no party man.\\" Posner starts his criticism of Bush with a broad attack on his behavior in his final months as President: Posner blames Bush for pushing policies, such as the \\"ownership society\\",Posner, p. 113. a $10 trillion national debt and \\"the huge budget deficits run by the Bush administration\\",Posner, P. 190. \\"prop[ping] up stock prices by keeping interest rates low,\\" which were underlying causes of the crisis, as well as \\"Dithering\\" in late 2008.Posner, p. 141. By the ownership society, Posner referred to the American Dream Down Payment Act of 2003 and other laws that made ownership easier. Posner points out that Bush's proposed privatization of Social Security would have made the depression even more harmful.Posner, pp. 228-229. Posner states that one of the \\"lessons learned\\" is that the \\"blurred\\" line between \\"the government and the private sector ... in the Bush Administration\\" contributed to a lack of insight into the underlying problems.Posner, pp. 238-239. Even more so, \\"the emphatically pro-business philosophy of the Bush administration made the SEC too trusting of the securities industry.\\"Posner, p. 248. The bottom line is that \\"there might not have been a depression had it not been for the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy.\\"Posner, p. 271. Criticism of capitalism and mainstream economists Posner, famous for his advocacy of free markets, turns on free-market capitalism in this book: \\"the financial crisis is indeed a crisis of capitalism rather than a failure of government.\\"Posner, p. 240, bottom line. Posner explicitly states that he has changed his mind, that in the words of economist Robert Lucas, \\"that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded.\\"Posner, p. 286-287. Posner states that: Posner points out that one of the causes of the depression was \\"blindness to warning signs\\" of a crisis. A few people had warned of problems, including Nouriel Roubini,Posner, pp. 124-125, 132-133, 138-139, 142-143, 252. and Brooksley Born,Posner, p. 127. but they were ignored. He asserts that the \\"depression is a failure of capitalism\\".Posner, p. 260. This is the second and most powerful shock. The New York Times points out that: Spreading the blame: critiques of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, et al. Posner also assigns part of the blame for the recession on the administration of Bill Clinton. He says they were to blame for pushing policies that created the housing bubble. The training and experience of several Clinton advisors, notably Robert Rubin, were tilted towards Wall Street, which he found to be ultimately dangerous.Posner, pp. 81, 99-100. Likewise, Alan Greenspan, Clinton's appointee as chairman of the Federal Reserve, gets a special blame for pushing low interest rates, which increased stock prices and led, in turn, to the bubbles in banking, stocks, and housing. Posner sweeps a wide swath in assigning portions of blame for causing the underlying recession on a variety of factors and persons. He praises the use of specific deterrence in shaming debtors, which, in his mind, has not been used enough recently.Posner, pp. 157-158. He faults the concept of limited liability for increasing risk.Posner, pp. 85-86, 93. He points out the harmful focus on short-term profits at the expenses of long-term stability.Posner, pp. 80, 94-99. Bad credit was, in Posner's words, given a \\"so what?\\" attitude.Posner, pp. 101-105. Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress encouraged home ownership by people who had bad credit and should have, in Posner's view, remained tenants.Posner, pp. 77-78, 111-112. Competition in the banking industry led to deregulation in Clinton's administration, and enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which increased risk to the system. Posner is not alone in criticizing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; some economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz also believe it helped create the 2007 financial crisis.Marcus Baram, \\"Who's Whining Now? Gramm Slammed By Economists: 'Nation of Whiners' Comments Criticized by Finance Experts in Light of Current Crisis,\\" ABC News, September 19, 2008. Found at ABC News website. Accessed March 29, 2010. Encouraging the practice of \\"sweeps\\" by large investors (removing money from demand deposits into money market funds overnight) exacerbated the problem.Posner, pp. 20, 130-131. Preconceptions and ideology held by both sides of the spectrum, argues the book, prevented novel challenges to changing fiscal realities. Macroeconomics has not made use of chaos theory,Posner, pp. 131-134, 261 et seq. and thus says Posner, the signal-noise ratio prevented a clear analysis and even created \\"blindness\\" and \\"misinformation\\" for policy analysts.Posner, pp. 118-138, 141-142, 159. Posner went on the record against how Barack Obama's administration's Keynesian stimulus in the ARRA \\"could have been better designed,\\" and specifically demurs against some of Obama's statements: Nonetheless, Posner points out that what is rational for an individual corporation may not be rational for the industry as a whole.Posner, pp. 107, 111-112. Reception Reviewing for The New York Times, Jonathan Rauch wrote that: The Huffington Post gave a long review, noting with a bit of schadenfreude that Posner had changed his views.Marcus Baram, \\"Judge Richard Posner Questions His Free-Market Faith In \\"A Failure Of Capitalism\\",\\" The Huffington Post, April 20, 2009, found at Huffington Post website. Accessed September 1, 2009. Michael Casey, in a review published in the Irish Times, writes \\"Blaming the system is a cop-out....

Accessed September 1, 2009. In The Washington Post, Paul M. Barrett, an assistant managing editor of Business Week, writes that Posner seems to spread the blame too much, denigrates mere stupidity and \\"greed\\" as causes, and lacks \\"constructive proposals for reform....\\" Barrett points out how notable this book is, which is that \\"his critique is bracing, all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats.\\" The New York Review of Books said that \\"it is at best a partial success; it gets some things right and some things wrong, and the items on both sides of the ledger are important.\\"Robert M.

In the Review, Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Robert Solow praises the author quite faintly: Solow's review itself was notable to some degree, according to Brad DeLong, who critiqued Posner's logic along the way: In an interview with The Economist, Posner was forced to defend his use of the term \\"depression\\" and his move \\"to the centre...\\" Forbes magazine printed the preface of the book as a measure of its importance.Forbes.com website. September 8, 2009. In January 2010, The New Yorker revisited A Failure of Capitalism, noting that by September 2009, Posner had become a confirmed Keynesian: \\"As acts of betrayal go, this was roughly akin to Johnny Damon's shaving off his beard, forsaking the Red Sox Nation, and joining the Yankees.\\" John Cassidy, Letter from Chicago, \\"After the Blowup,\\" The New Yorker, January 11, 2010, p. 28, at 28-29, extract found at newyorker.com archives.

His first thought during their first kiss was, \\"New Jersey was never like this!\\" In a play on the accent prevalent in the northeastern United States, Crosby's version has him humorously pronouncing the name as \\"New Joisey.\\" Their marriage and eventual settlement in Hoboken would be a happy one, resulting in thirteen children with both Irish and Spanish names. It also resulted in the unlikely married name of the woman in the title: Conchita Marquita Lolita Pepita Rosita Juanita O'Toole.http://www.nefkom.net/al-foster/c-titles.htm Lyrics and recording information at Nefkom.nethttp://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/c/conchitamarquitalolitapepitarositajuanitalopez.shtml Lyrics and additional information at Lyricsplayground.comhttps://archive.org/details/ConchitaMarquitaLolitaPepitaRositaJuanitaLopez1942 Link to streaming and mp3 of the Bing Crosby version of the song at Archive.org References Category:1942 songs Category:Bing Crosby songs Category:Glenn Miller songs Category:Novelty songs Category:Songs with music by Jule Styne Category:Songs with lyrics by Herb Magidson ","title":"Conchita Marquita Lolita Pepita Rosita Juanita Lopez"},{"id":"24189431","text":"Constant maturity refers to have a fixed (constant) maturity.

The character was portrayed by the late Cory Monteith and first appeared on television when Glee initially premiered its pilot episode on Fox on May 19, 2009. Finn was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. Glee follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio. Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team. A popular jock at the top of the school's social hierarchy, when he finds himself forced to join the school's glee club, he discovers that he loves it, although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member. His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club, which is at the bottom of the social ladder, while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks. The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) and glee club star singer Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), the series' female lead. Following Monteith's death on July 13, 2013, it was announced that Finn's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season, titled \\"The Quarterback\\". Monteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, \\"Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he‚Äôs just a little na√Øve.\\" Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that he and Michele were \\"both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet\\" in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of IGN wrote, \\"We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn [...] it's good to see this, because up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in.\\" In the second season's eighth episode, \\"Furt\\", Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack said, \\"It's been a while since we‚Äôve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be.\\" Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, and was nominated in the same category in 2010. Although he was not a singer before being cast as Finn, Monteith sang lead or joint lead on many songs on the show, most of which have charted in the US and abroad. \\"Jessie's Girl\\", which Finn performed as a solo, was certified gold in Australia, one of only three singles to do so from the show's releases in that country; he was joint lead on \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the pilot episode, the show's first single sung by the glee club, which was certified gold and platinum in Australia and the US. Development Casting and creation Cory Monteith at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards in 2010 Finn Hudson is portrayed by Cory Monteith. He has also been portrayed as a child by Jerry Phillips in \\"Pilot\\" and as a preschooler by Jake Vaughn in the episode \\"The Substitute\\". When Glee was being cast, Monteith's Vancouver agent, Elena Kirschner, submitted a video of him drumming with some pencils and Tupperware containers. Series creator (Ryan Murphy) took notice of the video, but pointed out that he had to be singing, as auditioning actors for Glee with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Monteith submitted a second, musical tape, in which he sang \\"a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version\\" of REO Speedwagon's \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\". He then attended a mass audition in Los Angeles; his vocal skills were considered weak, but he later performed very well with one of Glee casting directors, who said that his audition captured the most elusive quality of Finn's, his \\"naive, but not stupid sweetness\\". Monteith said of his casting process, \\"I was like a lot of kids, looking for something to be interested in. Something to be passionate about. All you need is permission. Not only for Glee, but for anything in life.\\" In December 2010, Murphy announced that some members of the cast of Glee would be replaced after the end of the third season in spring 2012, to coincide with their graduation. Murphy said: \\"Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot.\\" He added, \\"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\\" Although Murphy said in July 2011 that Monteith would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season, Falchuk later stated that while Monteith, along with Lea Michele and Chris Colfer, would graduate at the end of the third season, \\"because they're graduating doesn't mean they're leaving the show.\\" Falchuk insisted that \\"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go‚Ä¶. They are not done with the show after this season.\\" Characterization Finn originated as a character who \\"walks a fine line between following his dreams and balancing what other people expect of him.\\" Monteith's former acting coach said: \\"You've got to be incredibly smart to understand how dim Finn can be\\", though Monteith appreciated the fact that Finn is more than \\"just a dumb jock\\". He has admitted that he is sometimes frustrated by Finn's \\"convenient dumb-guy writing\\", and commented, \\"I think every actor wants to be stretched. But it's also important to realize that whatever we're doing works. I realize that this happens to an actor about once every ten lifetimes. To be on a show that's this good, it's rarefied air.\\" Finn has matured during his run on the series‚Äîin January 2011, Monteith noted that he had \\"grown up a little bit\\" and become \\"a little wiser\\". He later expanded, \\"Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he‚Äôs just naive. The opposite of me. I love Finn‚Äôs optimism. He‚Äôs very idealistic; he wants a good girl to love him, and he chases after what he wants in life‚Äîthat I can relate to.\\" The actor hoped that in time his character would be able to grow and mature more. He said in an interview with MTV, \\"I think the harder it is for him, the better, you know? I think Finn has a lot of growing up to do and I think that Finn has a lot of struggle left for him. I think dealing with a lot of his dad stuff, the passing of his father and dealing with the unrequited love all of a sudden from Rachel, I think the more trouble he goes through, the more interesting it is for me as an actor.\\" Over the course of his run on the series, Finn's primary relationship has been with the glee club's main singer, Rachel. In a meeting with the press at PaleyFest2011, which occurred when the characters were in the middle of a months-long breakup, Monteith commented: \\"That's a very important central relationship to the show. I think it's important, and I think they're endgame, but I can't be sure of when. I try not to get too attached to the pairing, so I can focus on storyline that does come my way.\\" Falchuk said of the Finn‚ÄìRachel relationship ahead of the third season, \\"We're not interested in breaking them up this year but at the same time the challenge is they are graduating, they are different kinds of people and where does that take you?\\" During the PaleyFest2011 Glee cast interview, Monteith said, \\"There are a lot of people who really, really want Finn and Rachel to be together. But at the same time, I think that it's really interesting when they're clearly in love with each other but they're apart. I think it makes for good television.\\" He added, \\"I think there's a different dynamic to Finn with Quinn and with Rachel, and single.\\" Storylines Season 1 Finn's storylines have mainly revolved around that of glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele, pictured). Finn is introduced as quarterback of the William McKinley High School football team. He is blackmailed into joining the school glee club, New Directions, by its faculty director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Despite being ostracized by the other football players, including his best friend Puck (Mark Salling), Finn comes to enjoy being in the club. This worries his girlfriend, head cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), so she joins New Directions to keep an eye on him, afraid that lead singer Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) interest in Finn may be reciprocated. Quinn discovers that she is pregnant, as she had cheated on Finn with Puck, but tells Finn that the baby is his, though they never actually had intercourse. She subsequently moves in with Finn and his mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) after her parents find out about her pregnancy and evict her. When Rachel figures out that Puck is the father and informs Finn, he attacks Puck, breaks up with Quinn, and quits the glee club in a fury; but after cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) sabotages the glee club's first show choir competition, he is able to set aside his anger and return to lead the club to victory. He and Rachel briefly date, but he ends the relationship to concentrate on his own well-being. By the time Finn realizes that he truly does want to be with Rachel, he is chagrined to discover that she has started dating Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), the lead singer of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline. Cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity to improve her social status and his, and he accepts, but afterward he regrets having done so and claims to Rachel that he did not go through with it; she, in turn, falsely claims to have had sex with Jesse. By the time the club reach the next stage of show choir competitions, Jesse has betrayed Rachel and broken up with her. As Finn and Rachel are about to go onstage, Finn tells her that he loves her; although they lose the competition, they become a couple and continue dating well into the next school year. Glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), who is gay, has a longstanding crush on Finn, and sets up his father Burt (Mike O'Malley) with Finn's mother Carole in the hopes of spending more time with him. Finn initially opposes the relationship, worried that his mother will forget about his late father, but relents when Burt tells Finn that he loves Carole, though Kurt is dismayed by the deepening rapport between Finn and Burt. Finn and his mother eventually move in with the Hummels, but when Finn, uncomfortable about rooming with Kurt who he knows has a crush on him but will not admit it, uses a homophobic slur against Kurt during an argument, Burt throws him out. Finn is ashamed, and makes amends by standing up for Kurt when he is victimized by bullies. The following fall, the bullying against Kurt has intensified, but Finn refuses to stand up for him this time, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. When their parents marry, Finn uses his best man speech as an opportunity to apologize to Kurt, which begins a brotherly bond between the two. In the spring, the two of them team up to arrange the funeral of Sue Sylvester's sister, Jean (Robin Trocki), when Sue is too upset to do so, after which Sue ends her long-running campaign to destroy the glee club. Season 2 At the beginning of the second season, Finn runs afoul of the new football coach, Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), who briefly kicks him off the team, but he is eventually reinstated, and soon becomes quarterback again. Rachel learns the truth about Finn sleeping with Santana. Hurt, she makes out with Puck to get even with Finn; this betrayal causes Finn to break up with her. The football team clinches a spot in the championship game, but animosity is running high between glee and non-glee members and harming the team's performance. In \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", Coach Beiste and Will Schuester force the entire football team to join the glee club for a week to settle their differences and dispel their prejudices. After a promising start, the non-glee members quit the club and are kicked off the team; at the same time, Sue arranges to have the cheerleading Regionals rescheduled to conflict with the football championship to sabotage both Beiste and Will, whose glee club now has to do the halftime show. With the football team down to half strength and the glee club without its cheerleader members, football players Finn and Puck settle their differences; Puck convinces the non-glee football players to perform in the halftime show, which will also get them back on the team, while Finn convinces Quinn, Santana, and Brittany (Heather Morris) to quit the Cheerios and perform in the halftime show instead. The show is a great success, and the football team wins the championship game. Emboldened by leading the team to the championship, Finn sets his eyes on a new prize: Quinn, who is in a serious relationship with football player and glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet). After setting up a kissing booth ostensibly to raise money for the glee club, Finn succeeds in kissing Quinn, and they make an assignation. Although Quinn ultimately decides to stay with Sam, he finds out about her cheating on him with Finn, and breaks up with her. Finn and Quinn reunite, campaign together for prom king and queen and go to junior prom together, but Finn is kicked out for fighting with a newly returned Jesse over Rachel, and prom king and queen are won by other students. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn again because he realizes how deep his feelings are for Rachel. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to come back to him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her lifelong dream of Broadway stardom and her love for him. At the end of their duet‚Äî\\"Pretending\\", written by Finn‚Äîthe audience responds with awkward silence as Rachel and Finn actually kiss; the club consequently fails to place at Nationals. Back in Ohio, Rachel tells Finn she is moving to New York for college and will not be coming back; he reminds her that they have a whole year until graduation and they kiss, renewing their relationship. Season 3 As the new school year begins, Finn, a senior, has trouble figuring out what he wants to do with his life after graduation. In the fifth episode, \\"The First Time\\", Finn is not recruited to play football in college, as he had hoped. He and Rachel decide to have sex together for the first time. In the episode \\"Mash Off\\", Santana, who has joined the rival Troubletones, is relentlessly bullying Finn. After a fake apology pushes him to the edge, Finn tells her to just \\"come out of the closet\\" and accuses her of being a coward for tearing other people down only because she can't admit to everyone that she's in love with Brittany. They are overheard by a girl whose uncle is running against Sue in a congressional campaign, and he uses Santana's lesbianism‚Äîbecause she's Sue's cheerleading co-captain‚Äîagainst Sue in a campaign commercial, effectively \\"outing\\" her. Santana, devastated by this, slaps Finn, but he later claims it was a \\"stage slap\\" to prevent her from being suspended. In the episode \\"Yes/No\\", Finn asks Rachel to marry him. In the episode \\"On My Way\\", the wedding is set for after the Regionals competition, which New Directions wins, but it is canceled after Quinn is badly injured in a car crash on her way to the ceremony. They change the wedding date to after graduation, but after Finn fails to get into his New York acting school while she has been accepted by hers and she decides to wait a year, he instead sends her off to New York without him, and tells her that he has enlisted in the army and is \\"setting her free\\". Season 4 Finn has not been in touch with Rachel or Kurt all summer and into the fall‚Äîthe two friends are now rooming together in Brooklyn while Rachel is attending NYADA‚Äîbut he reappears unexpectedly at the end of the third episode. He has been given an early discharge from the army after injuring himself. He finds out she kissed Brody (Dean Geyer), a NYADA junior, and feels that he doesn't belong in her world in New York, so he returns to Lima without telling her. She then breaks up with him. In Lima, Finn is working at Burt's tire shop again, and Artie enlists his help to co-direct the school musical, Grease, which had been Finn's suggestion. When Rachel comes to see the musical in the \\"Glease\\" episode, their reunion does not go well, and they agree to refrain from contact when Rachel visits Lima in the future. Will takes a leave of absence from McKinley to be a member of a blue-ribbon panel in Washington, DC, so starting in \\"Dynamic Duets\\", Finn becomes the interim director of New Directions. While he has a rocky start in the position, they come to accept him as their leader. At Sectionals, the glee club loses to the Warblers after Marley (Melissa Benoist) passes out on stage, interrupting the performance. Afterward, Finn does what he can to keep the club together and finally succeeds despite Sue's opposition‚Äîshe has deprived New Directions of rehearsal space at school. The Warblers are disqualified, and New Directions is again eligible to compete in Regionals; the choir room is returned to them. Finn enlists Emma, who is deep in wedding preparations in advance of Will's return, to help him judge a glee club competition for which member is the best diva. When he finds her panicking over the reception arrangements, he kisses her. In \\"I Do\\", when Emma flees the church the day of the wedding, Finn blames himself, but Rachel sets him straight, and he and Rachel sleep with each other post-reception. In \\"Girls (and Boys) On Film\\", Finn teams up with Artie to help find Emma for Will; he later confesses to Will that he kissed Emma, and Will is unable to forgive him. Since working with Will is untenable, Finn leaves New Directions though he enjoyed directing them; Marley tells him he's a good teacher, and he should get a teaching degree. He goes to college, where he shares a dorm room with Puck‚Äîwho isn't actually attending the school. Will later asks Finn to return to co-lead New Directions, and he agrees. Meanwhile, Santana has discovered that Brody, who is now living with Rachel, is a gigolo, and tells Finn, who flies to New York and warns Brody away, ultimately beating him up and saying, \\"Stay away from my future wife.\\" When Rachel finds out and breaks up with Brody, she admits that the relationship never would have worked because she was using it to try to get over her heartache about Finn. Rachel later thanks him for his intervention in \\"Sweet Dreams\\" when she calls him to get advice for choosing an audition song for the upcoming Broadway revival of Funny Girl. Season 5 \\"The Quarterback\\", the third episode of the fifth season, opens three weeks after Finn's funeral. No cause of death is given. Kurt, in a voiceover, explains that it is not the circumstances of Finn's death that matter, but how he lived his life. Season 6 In the flash back episode \\"2009\\", the original Glee club members have second thoughts about Finn being the leader of the new club. After talking about how different Finn is from the other school jocks, they decide to let him stay in the club. The scene moves to the New Directions, with Finn, singing Don't Stop Believing from the \\"Pilot\\" episode. In the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\", U.S. Vice President Sue Sylvester rededicates the McKinley High auditorium to be named in honor of Finn. Musical performances As Finn is the most frequent male lead in New Directions numbers, Monteith features in a great many musical performances which have been released as singles available for digital download and are also featured in the show's soundtrack albums. He frequently shares vocal leads with the main female singer, Rachel, as in the pilot episode's closing song, Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin', the single of which has sold over a million copies and been certified platinum in the US and Australia. Like Finn, Monteith was a novice singer when the show started. In an interview with GQ Alex Pappademus, he noted that, early on, \\"you could hear the Auto-Tune.\\" He was not called on to sing much on the first few episodes, as he rapped in \\"Push It\\" for \\"Showmance\\", had a short solo phrase in the song \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\" in \\"Acafellas\\", and was not featured as a vocal lead in \\"Preggers\\". Over the next three episodes, he shares the lead on four group numbers. Three are with Rachel: Queen's \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"No Air\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\". The fourth is a boys-only mash-up of Bon Jovi's \\"It's My Life\\" with Usher's \\"Confessions Part II\\", where Finn sings lead on the \\"It's My Life\\" sections and Artie on the rest. Excluding a scene from the pilot of him singing a portion of \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" in the shower, Finn's first solo songs are not until the show's tenth episode, \\"Ballad\\". Finn sings \\"I'll Stand By You\\" to the unborn child he thinks is his, and later sings \\"(You're) Having My Baby\\" to Quinn, the mother of the child, in front of her parents, who respond with her mother being forced to watch as her father evicts her from the family home. He has two solo numbers later in the season: \\"Hello, I Love You\\" by The Doors, characterized by Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle as \\"one of Finn's best vocal performances to date\\", and \\"Jessie's Girl\\" by Rick Springfield; the latter song charted in the top ten in Australia, Canada and Ireland, and was certified gold in Australia, one of only three singles from Glee to have received gold certification in that country. Finn sings lead more frequently in the second half of the first season, as he is featured in over a dozen songs, including several with Rachel. However, in Glee second season, he sings lead in fewer songs than in the first, though he again sings a significant proportion with Rachel, including the duets \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\", \\"With You I'm Born Again\\", \\"Last Christmas\\", and the one ostensibly written by Finn at the end of the season, \\"Pretending\\". His first solo performance of the second season, in the episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\", is R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\". Monteith said he and series music producer Adam Anders \\"had a bit of a different idea\\" about how the song should be performed. While Anders \\"always brings the songs in very positive, very upbeat\\", he felt the song \\"was expressing a betrayal\\", and with Finn feeling both betrayal and anger, Monteith wanted his performance to reflect that. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented positively on the arrangement of Monteith's song, and graded the performance an \\"A\\", but Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone was critical of the arrangement, and said Monteith's performance was \\"more awkward than inspired.\\" Finn's other solo is \\"I've Gotta Be Me\\" in the episode \\"Born This Way\\". In the episode \\"Furt\\", when Finn's mother marries Kurt's father and the glee club provides music for the wedding, two of the songs are by Bruno Mars: \\"Marry You\\", which is sung by the entire club as a big processional production number, and \\"Just the Way You Are\\", which is sung by Finn to Kurt at the reception. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized the \\"two Bruno Mars songs\\" as \\"brilliant in execution and touching in sentiment\\", and Futterman agreed: \\"the Bruno Mars songs gave the show two of its best performances this season\\". While Benigno and Stack also praised \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and both gave the song an \\"A\\", Jen Harper of BuddyTV thought Monteith's vocals as Finn \\"aren't the strongest\\" and AOL TV Jean Bentley also wished Finn had not been the soloist. In \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", Finn led his football teammates, some of whom were performing with the glee club under duress, in The Zombies' \\"She's Not There\\". VanDerWerff called it \\"one of the better numbers of the season\\", and Futterman felt that Monteith's vocals were a \\"perfect fit\\" for the song. Finn's sole duet with Quinn, Fleetwood Mac's \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" from the episode \\"Rumours\\", was given an \\"A‚àí\\" by Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez, and Futterman said it was \\"better than Quinn and Sam's 'Lucky, which she had called \\"charming\\" when it was performed in \\"Duets\\". Reception Critical response The character of Finn has gotten mixed to positive reviews from television critics. VanDerWerff praised the \\"terrific\\" cast in the pilot episode, and wrote that Monteith and Michele \\"are both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet as the show choir's central two singers\\". The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan opined that \\"Cory Monteith gives quarterback Finn Hudson a jock-ish authority mixed with an appealingly square naivete.\\" Korbi Ghosh of Zap2it enjoyed Finn's \\"sweet nature\\" and observed, \\"it's clear that at Finn's core, he's a good person.\\" Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times noted a contradiction in his characterization in the episode \\"Preggers\\"‚Äîshe questioned whether the intelligence he demonstrated in striving for a football scholarship was incongruent in a character who believed he had impregnated Quinn by sharing a hot tub with her. Goldman welcomed the emergence of Finn's \\"darker side\\" as he manipulated Rachel in \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\", as \\"up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in\\". Denise Martin of the Los Angeles Times added, \\"Did anyone not want to kill Finn for coming on to Rachel to get her to come back to the club? (Yes, the logic was there. He wants to win a scholarship so he can provide for the baby he thinks is his. But a girl's heart is a fragile thing, and like Rachel tells him, he could have just tried being honest.)\\" In his review of \\"Ballad\\", Goldman commented: \\"Finn singing 'I'll Stand By You' to the unborn baby he thinks is his was very sweet\\". He found the scene that followed Finn's revelation of Quinn's pregnancy to her parents the grimmest on Glee to that point. The intense sequence featuring Finn, Kurt and Burt in \\"Theatricality\\" garnered praise for Monteith from James Poniewozik of Time, who wrote: \\"One thing I love about his performance, here and throughout Glee, is that he plays Finn as a kid, which of course he still is. He's basically a good kid, but as his 'faggy' outburst shows, he's flawed and often overwhelmed. And while he has little to do during Burt's lecture but react, his reactions are great: he's scared and defensive, but shows Finn's guilt at the same time.\\" When Finn's mother marries Kurt's father in the second season's eighth episode, \\"Furt\\", Stack was pleased to see Finn being featured: \\"It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be.\\" While giving \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" episode a \\"C\\" grade, VanDerWerff wrote as an aside, \\"Let‚Äôs pause for a moment to give Cory Monteith some praise, though, since he was asked to do a lot of difficult things in this episode, in regards to selling the idea of Finn as a leader, bringing disparate groups together, and he mostly managed that task, much better than he has in past episodes.\\" While reviewing \\"Funeral\\", the season's penultimate episode, Gonzalez said, \\"I was glad that the writers chose [‚Ä¶] Finn and Kurt to be the ones to connect with Sue because I think they're two of the most genuine characters on the show. [‚Ä¶] I think they pulled it off well.\\" In his review of \\"Funeral\\", VanDerVerff noted that Finn was not the best vocalist among the male students: \\"the show hits on something very odd in its DNA: Finn continues to be the male lead of the group because he‚Äôs the male lead of the show, less because he‚Äôs the best singer New Directions has. [...] But because he‚Äôs trying to get better, that‚Äôs OK\\". At the conclusion of the second season, Poniewozik wrote that he had not found the relationship between Finn and Rachel \\"the most compelling story\\" of the season, and as such \\"didn't enjoy 'New York' as much as [he] might have\\", and VanDerWerff commented that their storyline had \\"ceased being too interesting long ago.\\" However, the former conceded \\"I may not be that invested in Finn/Rachel, but the startling moment where the audience disappeared in the middle of their kiss made me feel like I was\\", and the latter opined that their kiss resonated, despite being unoriginal and \\"too neat way of suggesting that Rachel can't have both Finn and her Broadway dreams\\". Accolades Monteith won the 2011 Teen Choice Award in the Choice TV: Actor Comedy category for his portrayal of Finn, and was a member of the Glee cast ensemble given the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series award at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards. He received several other nominations for the role, including Teen Choice Awards in 2009 for Choice TV: Breakout Star Male and in 2010 for Choice TV: Comedy Actor, and the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards ensemble nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.

The character is portrayed by actor Matthew Morrison and has appeared in Glee since its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Will was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. He is a Spanish teacher at the fictional William McKinley High School and the director of the show's titular glee club in Lima Ohio, where the show is set. He ultimately becomes the school's principal. His storylines have seen him revive the school's failing glee club, leave his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and ultimately win the love of school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and marries her. Morrison was cast as Will after Murphy spent three months observing actors on Broadway. Several musical performances featuring him have been released as singles, available for digital download, and also appear on the soundtrack albums Glee: The Music, Volume 1 and Glee: The Music, Volume 2, among others. Morrison was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards for his performance in the role. The character initially received some negative reviews from critics, deemed \\"a little drab\\" by Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times. However, as the series progressed, Morrison attracted praise for his acting in the role, with critics also commenting positively on the development of the romantic relationship between Will and Emma. Development Casting and creation In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza. From the beginning, Murphy considered the role ideal for Morrison after being impressed by his Broadway bravado. The creators of Glee were initially looking for a song-and-dance man who could pass as a small-town high school teacher. Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk later commented about his casting process, \\"You'd think there must be a lot of good-looking 30-year-old guys who can sing, dance, and act, but there really aren't.\\" Morrison was cast as Spanish teacher Will Schuester, whose primary role in the series conception was re-assembling the school glee club and \\"restoring it to its former glory.\\" Morrison has assessed that the crux of Glee is \\"about [Will's] passion for music and influencing his kids\\". Several songs performed by Morrison as Will have been released as singles, available for digital download. Studio recordings of Morrison's performances of \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" and \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\" were also released as bonus-tracks on copies of Glee: The Music, Volume 1 purchased from Target stores. Storylines Season 1 Morrison plays glee club director Will Schuester. Upon learning that William McKinley High School's glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) has been fired for inappropriate conduct, Spanish teacher Will Schuester volunteers to take over the club, hoping to restore it to its former glory. After first taking over the glee club Will becomes the father figure to all the glee club, especially to Finn Hudson, whose father died when he was a baby. He is also shown to be the father figure to Puck and Quinn caring for her throughout her pregnancy. Will's role as the father figure was first shown after Finn learns that Quinn is pregnant. He goes to Will for guidance, however he completely breaks down in Will's arms. Will is married to his high school sweetheart Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), who does not support his dedication to the glee club. When Terri announces that she is pregnant, she pressures Will to resign as a teacher and take a better paying job as an accountant. Will is prepared to do so, but after a motivational talk from school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and seeing the club perform well without his tutelage, Will decides to remain at the school and coach the team. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) allows him to do so, but warns that if the club fails to place at the Regionals competition, he will close it down. Will briefly works after hours at the school as a janitor to earn extra money, unaware that Terri has discovered that she was experiencing a hysterical pregnancy and is not actually pregnant. He becomes closer to Emma, who has romantic feelings for him, but she ultimately curtails their time spent together, believing that he is about to start a family. To his dismay, she later becomes engaged to football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher). Will's dedication to the glee club wavers when his students question his choreography skills, but after starting a well-received all-male a cappella group, the \\"Acafellas\\", he recommits to the club. In the episode \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\", after Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) has temporarily quit the glee club, Will recruits his former classmate, high school dropout April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), as the new female lead. However, she is an alcoholic and proves to be a bad influence on the kids, and he has her leave. In \\"Throwdown\\", Will's nemesis, cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), is made co-director of the club and divides up the students, but when their fighting leads the kids to walk out in disgust, Sue steps down. In the episode \\"Mattress\\", Will uncovers Terri's fake pregnancy when he discovers her pregnancy pad in a drawer. He angrily confronts her, then walks out, but remains undecided over whether to end their marriage. He inadvertently renders the glee club ineligible to compete at Sectionals by sleeping on a mattress that they had been given for working on a television commercial, and steps down as director so they will be allowed to perform. Emma decides to postpone her wedding to Ken by several hours to accompany the glee club to Sectionals in Will's place, and the club wins. Ken ends their engagement and cancels the wedding because of this, and after he has officially ended his relationship with Terri, Will and Emma share a kiss. In \\"Hell-O\\", Will and Emma try to start a relationship, but after he finds out that she's a virgin, they take a break. Will then proceeds to make out with the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), who afterward advises him to take time to rediscover who he is now that he's ending a long marriage. In \\"The Power of Madonna\\", after Sue tells Emma that she has no control over her own body, Emma decides to \\"do the nasty\\" with Will at his place. However, they don't go through with it, and she runs out of Will's apartment without her shoes. Will admires her for \\"taking control by telling herself she wasn't ready\\", and promises to help her with her problems and start a relationship after his divorce with Terri is finalized. In the season finale, \\"Journey to Regionals\\", the glee club comes in last at the Regionals competition. The kids, heartbroken at the thought that the club is over, sing \\"To Sir With Love\\" to thank Will for all he's done. Sue, who overhears them, convinces Principal Figgins to allow the glee club another year to prove themselves. Will finally admits that he has been in love with Emma all along and kisses her, but she tells him that she has started dating her dentist, Carl Howell (John Stamos). Season 2 In the season two premiere, Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) is made the new school football coach, and the cheerleading and glee club budgets are slashed in favor of football. Although he at first conspires against Coach Beiste with Sue because of the budget cuts, Will eventually befriends her. In the episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\", Will tries to impress Emma by purchasing a new car similar to that of her boyfriend, Carl, and by joining the glee club in a racy performance of \\"Toxic\\". By the end of the episode he returns the car, realizing that he should be himself. When Emma mentions that The Rocky Horror Picture Show is her favorite musical, and she and Carl have been going to see it, Will decides to have the glee club perform it, and recruits Emma to assist him. However, when Carl becomes involved and is given a role, Will joins the production himself. Carl ends up accusing Will of trying to steal Emma, and Will backs off. In \\"The Substitute\\", Will contracts a severe case of the flu and is too ill to work. His ex-wife Terri comes over uninvited to take care of him, and the two end up sleeping together. Sue fires Will and appoints his substitute, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), in his stead. When Holly visits to ask Will for some advice, Terri discovers them talking and assumes the worst. Will tells Terri that he shouldn't have slept with her while ill, and that their divorce stands. Will is reinstated by Sue. He subsequently learns that Emma and Carl have impulsively married while in Las Vegas. He is upset, but wishes her well. He remains in love with her, and on a drunken night months later, he drunk dials Emma and leaves a highly suggestive message on the answering machine. Unfortunately, he has mistakenly dialed Sue's number, and Sue plays the message over the school's public address system. Will decides to abstain from alcohol, and gets the glee club, who have just ended a school assembly by vomiting during a song due to imbibing, to pledge to give up drinking until after Nationals. New Directions ekes out at tie with the Dalton Academy Warblers at the Sectionals competition, and will face them and Aural Intensity at Regionals. With the football team's glee club and non-glee members at odds, the team looks doomed to defeat at the championship game, so Will and Coach Beiste agree that the entire team has to join the glee club for one week. When Sue pulls her cheerleaders from the game, the team and glee club ultimately work together to perform the halftime show, and the team goes on to win the championship. Sue's cheerleaders lose their own Regionals, their first loss in seven years, and a seemingly depressed Sue inveigles Will to let her join the glee club for a week. She is unable to bring the club down from within, so she arranges to become the coach of Aural Intensity, hoping to defeat New Directions at Regionals, but the McKinley glee club wins. Holly returns to McKinley as a substitute sex education teacher, and starts dating Will, though they break up after five dates. At Carl's request, Holly counsels him and Emma, as they are having difficulties: Emma is still a virgin after four months of marriage. When pressed, she admits to them that she still has some feelings for Will. Carl moves out, and soon asks Emma for an annulment of their marriage. The stress makes Emma's OCD worse, and Will urges her to get treatment, which she does, and her condition begins to improve. April returns to ask Will's help: her first attempt at a Broadway show flopped, and she wants to mount a show based on her life story entitled CrossRhodes. She urges him to star with her in the show, and Emma tells him he should try. He decides to do so: he'll be in New York anyway for the glee club's Nationals competition, so he'd just stay afterward and start rehearsals for April's show. To avoid upsetting the glee club, he doesn't tell them his plans. Emma helps him pack up his apartment. In New York, he leaves the glee club unchaperoned while he goes to the Broadway theater where April's show is being mounted, and sings \\"Still Got Tonight\\" from the stage. When the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline, Dustin Goolsby (Cheyenne Jackson), tries to shake New Directions by telling them of Will's impending Broadway debut, he realizes that he wants to continue coaching them, and gives up on Broadway. New Directions comes in twelfth of fifty teams, and Will returns with them to Ohio. Season 3 At the beginning of the third season, Will and Emma are living together and sleeping in the same bed, though Emma remains a virgin. The membership of New Directions is down, and their recruitment drive proves unsuccessful. Will reluctantly rejects Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies) after a truly awful audition has the glee club membership demanding he do so; her father makes a huge donation to the school to fund a second glee club for her, and recruits former Vocal Adrenaline director Shelby Corcoran to run it. Will suffers further defections from the glee club when first Mercedes, and then Santana and Brittany, leave to join Shelby's rival club due to a lack of soloing opportunities in New Directions. Sue runs for Congress on a platform of cutting all funding for school arts programs, and Will's attempt to render her a figure of ridicule by glitterbombing her backfires‚Äîthe viral video instead improves her standing in the polls. She manages to eliminate the budget for the school's musical, but Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) arranges for funding from his fellow businessmen, and because of what the arts‚Äîand Will's glee club in particular‚Äîhave done for his son Kurt, he decides to run against Sue as a write-in candidate, with Will as his campaign manager, and defeats her. The rivalry between the two McKinley glee clubs comes to a head at Sectionals in the episode \\"Hold On to Sixteen\\". Although Rachel has been suspended from school and can't compete with them, Will's New Directions defeats Shelby's club. Shelby resigns and her club dissolves, with the original defectors, plus a greatly improved Sugar, returning to New Directions with the understanding that they will be given more solos. Will finally gets the courage to propose to Emma in the episode \\"Yes/No\\" after she blurts out that she wants to marry him, and recruits the glee club to help him select and perform the perfect song as a part of that proposal. He asks Finn to be his best man at the wedding, and Finn agrees, but when he asks Emma's parents for their blessing, he is refused. He goes ahead anyway, and after a spectacular performance, he asks Emma to marry him, and she accepts. After a tenure position goes up in the history department of McKinley High (\\"The Spanish Teacher\\"), Will ends up on the shortlist for the spot. At the same time, his own job as Spanish teacher is put to risk when Santana complains about his teaching style and he eventually gives it up to David Martinez (guest star Ricky Martin) after taking on history at an annual basis while Emma gains the tenure role, beating out Sue in the shortlist. Season 4 Will excitedly walked into the glee club room and he announced that Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams had transferred and joined their club. He doesn't like their competition to be the new Rachel. He was excited by Marley's performance and cut off Jake's performance. He later learns that Jake is Puck's younger half-brother. Will choreographs the group number which Marley led. Will suggests that Brittany should meet with Emma daily to deal with the impact of being held back to repeat her senior year. Will and Emma also get married in the end of Season 4. Season 5 During Season 5, the Glee Club faces its biggest challenges as Sue finally gets her way and disbands the group. Will's spouse Emma tries to get pregnant and succeeds. Her and Will's son Daniel Finn is born during Rachel Berry's debut of Funny Girl. Season 6 Will starts the season as the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline (upon a recommendation from Sue, stating she needed to get him out of her hair). Learning that Rachel is rebooting New Directions, he helps build her confidence a little despite the fact that he's now her rival. However, his team, led by new lead soloist Clint, doesn't respect him and only cares about winning. Despite trying to teach the group a lesson about tolerance with help from Unique Adams after Coach Beiste undergoes gender transitioning, the egos of Vocal Adrenaline drive him to his breaking point. After helping Unique with Beiste's transitioning by secretly putting together a transgender choir under the guise of pranking McKinley, he calls out Clint and the group about their arrogance and disrespect and quits. Rachel then enlists him to help out New Directions as a consultant. He is a groomsman at Santana and Brittany's wedding (which becomes a double wedding when Blaine and Kurt also get married), and later helps out with Myron Muskovitz's bar mitzvah. Then, when Dalton Academy burns down, he along with Rachel and Kurt take in Blaine and many of the displaced Warblers with the idea of merging them and New Directions into a supergroup to take down Vocal Adrenaline at Sectionals...much to Sue's dismay. He is present as a witness when the superintendent fires Sue over her many lies and reign of terror over the years. The merged group goes on to win Sectionals, and later Nationals as well. After the Nationals victory, Superintendent Harris tells Will that because of New Directions' success and his never giving up over the years, McKinley High is now designated as a performing arts school and promotes Will to principal. He hires New Directions alum Sam Evans to be the new glee coach. Five years later, McKinley is thriving as an arts school and Will watches proudly as Rachel wins her Tony Award and dedicates it to him. Reception The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan opined following Glee pilot episode: \\"Casting Matthew Morrison as Will Schuester [...] was a wise move; the actor not only has a sweet voice but a hangdog hopefulness that gives a needed anchor to the show's more satirical elements.\\" In contrast, Tom Shales for the Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will, writing: \\"Morrison is definitely not gleeful and doesn't seem particularly well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied.\\" Robert Lloyd for the Los Angeles Times commented on the show's early episodes that the adult characters \\"tend more to caricature than character\\", stating that by contrast, \\"Will, as the show's only normal person over the age of 18, [can] seem a little drab\\". However, he noted that Will \\"comes alive when singing and dancing\\", citing his \\"exuberant\\" performance of \\"Gold Digger\\" in the episode \\"Showmance\\". Reviewing the episode \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\", Mike Hale of the New York Times commented on Will's actions in having former member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth) re- instated in the glee club: \\"It's now time to wonder when the show will stop making Will behave in ways completely at odds with Mr. Morrison‚Äôs bland, gentle performance. (Or, conversely, when Mr. Morrison will start playing him the way he's written.)\\" Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly praised Morrison's acting in the episode \\"Vitamin D\\", writing: \\"Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There's a softness and a longing in them that I‚Äôm always surprised Emma matches.\\" Eric Goldman for IGN enjoyed Morrison's music performances in the episode \\"Mash-Up\\", commending: \\"I have to hand it to Matthew Morrison for just going for it in these sequences. There is of course something completely dorky about seeing this guy perform these songs, but Morrison infuses Will with such enjoyment in what he's doing, he completely sells it. And yes, the guy can dance.\\" Liz Pardue of Zap2it praised Morrison's acting in \\"Mattress\\", calling him \\"beyond fantastic\\" during the confrontation between Will and Terri. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle wrote that he \\"was glad to see Will react with the appropriate level of rage\\", but felt that the scene became too tense, leaving him almost feeling bad for Terri. Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal wrote that he was happy to see the \\"convoluted\\" fake pregnancy storyline end, commenting that it had seemed unreal to him from the outset as \\"Will Schue doesn‚Äôt strike me as a guy who misses much of anything. [...] The covered pregnancy storyline makes a mockery of his instincts and intelligence.\\" Aly Semigran of MTV praised \\"a devastated Matthew Morrison\\" for \\"nail[ing] just what a scary, sad, and life- altering moment that [was].\\" Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended: \\"Matthew Morrison showed another dimension to Will, and did a remarkable job doing so. There was anger and anguish all intertwined in this bitter and broken shell of a man. And he played it well enough where you feared for Terri.\\" Following the broadcast of the mid-season finale episode \\"Sectionals\\", in which Will and Emma kiss, Goldman commented: \\"Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns\\". Pardue was impressed with Will for leaving Terri, and called the kiss between Will and Emma \\"romantic\\" commenting that it made her \\"heart happy\\". Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been \\"more intriguing\\" to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. After the second season episode \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\", many critics objected to Will's characterization. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that his storyline with Emma \\"misplac[ed] what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place\\", and IGN's Robert Canning‚Äîwho otherwise enjoyed the episode, and rated it 8.5/10‚Äîobserved that Will was presented as being selfish and a \\"terrible educator\\", in contrast to his former role as the moral center of the show. Lisa de Moraes of the Washington Post initially found the focus on the adults a welcome change, but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed, and deemed it overall, \\"Creepy, vaguely uncomfortable, in slightly poor taste but well-intentioned, and ultimately, thoroughly entertaining to watch for reasons I can't quite put into words.\\" CNN's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma. In April 2012, the staff of Entertainment Weekly named Will one of the \\"20 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever\\". Marc Snetiker wrote that he had \\"the intrigue of a blank chalkboard and the personality of a pair of pleated khakis\\", and sometimes made \\"things just seem a little less gleeful.\\" References External links * Will Schuester at Fox.com Category:Glee (TV series) characters Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:American male characters in television Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional guitarists ","title":"Will Schuester"},{"id":"24189483","text":"\\"The Colorful Character\\" is a science fiction short story by American writer L. Sprague de Camp, part of his Viagens Interplanetarias series. It was first published in the magazine Thrilling Wonder Stories in the issue for December, 1949. It first appeared in book form in the collection Sprague de Camp's New Anthology of Science Fiction, published simultaneously in hardcover by Hamilton and in paperback by Panther Books in 1953. Plot summary Gregory Lawrence, an ordinary, nondescript scientist, is dismayed to learn that the famous interplanetary explorer Sir Erik Koskelainen has returned to Earth from the planet Krishna in the Tau Ceti star system, and is to stay with the family of L√≠cia Ferreira, the girl he has been courting. He is convinced that she will lose all interest in him and be smitten by the glamorous star traveler. He is quickly proven correct in his concern; he finds that he himself is not immune to the man's charm, and the whole membership of the Institute of Advanced Study he works for is bowled over as well. The Institute quickly falls in with Koskelainen's proposal to enlist it in a complete biological survey of Krishna's neighboring planet Ganesha, which has never previously been attempted. Only Reginald Schmidt, Lawrence's own supervisor, remains unconverted, recruiting him in a scheme to overturn the interloper's influence. Critical to the plot is Magramen the Dzleri, a centauroid native of Vishnu, another planet in the Tau Ceti system. At a general gathering of the scientists of the institute, the Vishnuvian, an acquaintance of the explorer, confronts and exposes him as Chabarian bad-Seraz, a humanoid alien from Krishna in disguise; Lawrence, riding on Magramen's back, then overtakes and captures the fleeing imposter. His heroism fails to impress L√≠cia, however, who was thoroughly taken in by the alien and is angry at Lawrence for overturning her romantic illusions. It turns out that the whole charade was a plot on behalf of the Krishnan kingdom of Balhib to break the Terran ban on high technology to that primitive world. Schmidt knew this because he himself is the real Erik Koskelainen, on Earth incognito for rest and relaxation in the wake of his interplanetary excursions. Setting \\"The Colorful Character\\" is set on a future Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias (\\"Interplanetary Tours\\" in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems is common, though limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives. Most reachable systems have life-bearing planets inhabited by alien races; an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples. The antagonist's native kingdom of Balhib on Krishna is the setting for de Camp's later Krishna novel The Tower of Zanid. Another alien resident at the institute, an unnamed member of Krishna's other intelligent race, the tailed and less human-appearing Koloftuma, may be Yuruzh, the hero of de Camp's later Krishna story The Virgin of Zesh; Yuruzh reveals in that tale that he had been taken to Earth and been a subject of scientific experimentation in his youth. As dated in the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories,\\" the action of \\"The Colorful Character\\" takes place in the year 2117 AD., falling between \\"The Inspector's Teeth\\" and The Continent Makers, and making it the second Viagens story set on Earth in terms of chronology.

The character is portrayed by actress Jane Lynch, and appears in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009, through the show's final episode, first broadcast on March 20, 2015. Sue was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. For the show's first four seasons, Sue is the track-suit wearing coach of the William McKinley High School cheerleading squad, and a ruthless bully to both students and faculty members alike. Because her cheerleading squad competes with the glee club for the school's limited funding, she is often at odds with the club and more particularly its director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Sue is the main antagonist throughout the series' run. In the show's fifth season, Sue is made the school's new principal, though she is ultimately fired late in the show's sixth and final season. Due to Lynch's initial limited availability, Sue was originally set to be a recurring character while Lynch was working on a Damon Wayans pilot for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). When that pilot fell through, Sue became a starring role. The character has been acclaimed by critics. Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has written that \\"Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching\\", while Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker has called Sue \\"the greatest Broadway-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series\\". In recognition of her portrayal of Sue, Lynch won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award. Storylines Season 1 Jane Lynch (pictured) plays Sue Throughout the first season of Glee, Sue makes numerous attempts at sabotaging the William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions. She enlists members of her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, to bring the club down from the inside, and conspires to lure away its star member, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Sue is appointed co-director of the club by Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), but soon scales back her involvement when her attempts to turn the club members against director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) fail. Hoping to ruin the club's chances of winning at the show choir Sectionals competition, Sue gives New Directions' setlist to the directors of their rival glee clubs. Despite having to devise a new setlist at the last moment, New Directions win by unanimous decision and Sue is suspended by Figgins. She blackmails him into allowing her back, and is selected as a judge for the show choir Regionals competition. Sue is ridiculed by the other judges for her lack of fame and underdog status, allowing her to empathize with the glee club members. She votes for New Directions to win, and although they place last, she blackmails Figgins into allowing them another year to compete. Sue's personal life is also explored over the course of the season. She has a commentary feature on the local television news, \\"Sue's Corner\\", which she uses to editorialize on issues such as littering and support for caning. She falls in love with news anchor Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones), but their burgeoning relationship comes to an abrupt end when she discovers he is sleeping with his co-anchor, Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). In the episode \\"Wheels\\", Sue allows Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), a freshman with Down syndrome, to join the Cheerios. Will is suspicious of her motives, increasingly so when Sue donates money to the school to fund three new ramps for students with disabilities. It is revealed that Sue's older sister Jean (Robin Trocki) also has Down syndrome, and lives in a residential care facility. Sue becomes a minor celebrity when Olivia Newton-John invites her to remake the video to \\"Physical\\", after a viral video of Sue Jazzercising to the track achieves internet notoriety. She donates her share of the profits to her sister's care home. Season 2 At the onset of the second season, Sue has formed a truce with Will, and together they conspire against the school's new football coach, Shannon Beiste (Dot Jones). When Will comes to regret his actions and apologizes, Sue renews their enmity. She is appointed acting principal after having Figgins infected with the flu, but although the school board is so impressed with her performance they make her position permanent, she resigns when they refuse to uphold her expulsion of Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), a bully who had threatened to kill glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer). After Sue learns that Rod and Andrea have become engaged, she announces her intention to marry herself. Her estranged mother Doris (Carol Burnett), a recently retired Nazi hunter, visits in an attempt to make amends for her absentee parenting, but is continuously critical of her daughter, to the point that Sue disinvites her during her wedding ceremony. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other. Sue grows disillusioned with cheerleading, and in an effort to recapture her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years. Sue is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with Katie Couric, and has her budget slashed. Depressed, Sue stages a fake suicide, and as she hoped would happen, is convinced to temporarily join the glee club to lift her spirits, though she really wants to bring down the club from within. When her attempts to do so fail, Sue decides to become the coach of Aural Intensity, one of New Directions' Regionals competitors, and deliberately injures their director in order to get the job. Sue is furious when her club loses to New Directions, and punches the announcer in the face. More intent than ever on destroying the glee club, Sue forms a \\"League of Doom\\", which consists of former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, Dustin Goolsby (Cheyenne Jackson), and Will's ex-wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig). Their first mission, to ruin a New Directions benefit, fails when Sandy is won over by a performance from Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and donates the full amount needed. Devastated by Jean's death from pneumonia, Sue turns to Terri, who has the glee club's plane tickets for Nationals changed from New York to Tripoli. She also removes Becky from the Cheerios, because she reminds her of her sister. Kurt and his stepbrother Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) help Sue to clean out Jean's things, and she accepts their offer to have New Directions perform at the funeral, as she is afraid no one else will come. At the well-attended funeral service, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. Touched by his support, Sue tells Will he is a good friend and she will no longer go after the glee club. She will instead be running for the United States House of Representatives on a platform of lowering health care costs, as her sister had faced significantly higher bills in her last few years. She then apologizes to Becky, reinstates her as a member of the Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad next year. As a final act of reconciliation, Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky. Season 3 At the start of the third season, Sue's campaign for Congress is not going well. She decides to pledge to get rid of all arts programs in schools, music and theater especially, until all students are reading at or above grade level. Will's attempt to embarrass Sue and highlight the value of the arts by glitter bombing her backfires, and Sue's poll numbers rise. She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing political ads containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her political ads. One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of \\"family values\\" for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship with one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste. Being seen in public with Cooter does not help her in the voting, however; she comes in third, and Burt wins. In the episode \\"On My Way\\", Sue reveals she is pregnant, shocking everyone. Her child is revealed by doctors to be a girl, but they mention that there were abnormalities on the scan. Sue mentions to Becky that she will have a child just like her, hinting that the baby may have Down's Syndrome. She shows unusual compassion, telling Will she will help him win nationals, letting Quinn rejoin the Cheerios, and is visibly upset at Karofsky's suicide attempt. Season 4 In the first episode of the fourth season, \\"The New Rachel\\", Sue, now a mother, introduces her newborn child named Robin to Kurt. Sue then calls Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), a new cheerleader into her office to take care of Robin. She heavily forbids new transgender student Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) to audition for the role of Rizzo on the school's musical, Grease, only to create an argument between her and Finn, who insists on casting Unique. This ends badly when Finn inadvertently insults Robin during the argument, starting a strong rivalry between the two. Sue \\"proposes\\" to Finn that if New Directions lose sectionals, the glee club would end. They lose and Sue uses the choir room for the Cheerios practices when the weather is cold. When New Directions discover that they won because the other club cheated, Sue gives them back the choir room. During christmas, Sue gets Millie Rose (Trisha Rae Stahl), the lunch lady and glee club member Marley Rose's (Melissa Benoist) mother as her secret santa. She overheard the conversation between them in which Marley wants to have a Christmas tree and at least some gifts, but Millie says they need to save money to pay a counselor to treat Marley for her eating disorder. Sue breaks into the Roses' home that night and leaves them a Christmas tree, several presents, and enough money to pay Marley's counselor. Sue is fired from the William McKinley High School in \\"Shooting Star\\", when Becky's gun is shot by accident, causing everyone to think that there's a school shooting. Sue says it was her gun and she misfired it while checking it, to protect Becky. Coach Roz replaces Sue as the cheerleader squad coach and takes her office. Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and Blaine tries to get her back on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired was the best thing that could have ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that she does not miss the Cheerios at all. Season 5 In the episode \\"Love Love Love,\\" Sue has come back to McKinley High after Becky confessed to the shooting. Upon her return, Sue gets Principal Figgins fired by faking incriminating details about him. He is demoted to janitor, while she takes his job as principal, where she constantly torments Figgins, and tells Will and Roz that she will keep the Cheerios and New Directions going if they win in their upcoming competitions. Following Finn's death in the episode \\"The Quarterback,\\" Sue orders the memorial in the school to be taken down, which angers Santana to the point where she confronts her and pushes her into a filing cabinet. She later reveals, after Santana apologizes to her, she is heartbroken Finn died believing she hated him, while she actually respected him and looked forward to having him as a colleague. In \\"Puppet Master\\" Sue experiences a hallucination in the choir room, later to be a gas leak. After fixing the pipe herself, she then becomes the school's permanent principal. In \\"City Of Angels\\", after New Directions comes in second in their Nationals competition, Sue disbands the club, although she gets Will a job interview at Carmel High School as the new Coach for Vocal Adrenaline. She later comes to New York City as Will's companion since neither his wife Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) nor Beiste could go to see Rachel's broadway opening night in Funny Girl. Her ulterior motive was because of the public backlash she received after stating that New York City and Broadway on \\"Sue's Corner\\" while never been there herself. She meets Mario (Chris Parnell), a New York citizen, and both are instantly lovestruck. They share their disdain of the show and walks out in the middle of the show, has a date in his restaurant and sleeps together in Rachel and Kurt's apartment. The next morning, Rachel berates the two, particularly Sue, and she leaves. After parting ways with Mario, she goes back to Lima and states that she loves New York on \\"Sue's Corner\\". Season 6 The final season begin with McKinley under Sue as its principal: test scores are up, body mass indexes are down. She also forcibly transferred Unique, Marley, Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner), and Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist) to other schools (she kept Kitty in McKinley for the Cheerios) to completely get rid of glee club's history. When Rachel gets a permission to reboot the glee club by the school board and leads it alongside Kurt, Sue is angry. In \\"Jagged Little Tapestry\\", Sue gives Beiste her support for the latter's transition process, and alongside Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), Quinn, and Coach Roz, are equally apprehensive about Becky's new boyfriend Darrell (Justin Prentice). During the course of the season, she tricks Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) to get Rachel falling for him in order to sabotage her and it is also revealed that she secretly ships Kurt and Blaine and was so devastated when they called off their engagement. She tries to get them back together, such as trapping them in an elevator and forcing them to kiss if they want to be released. In \\"A Wedding\\", Sue tries to attend Brittany and Santana's wedding only to be flatly refused for her treatment of everyone. Showing a softer side, Sue visits Santana's grandmother who doesn't believe in two women marrying and uses \\"some reverse Suecology\\" to get the woman to see that no matter what she believes, family is most important. Sue is then allowed to attend the wedding and helps convince Kurt and Blaine to marry alongside Brittany and Santana, providing the rings for them when they don't have any. Sue later provides the two couples with their dream honeymoons, telling them that despite how she's treated them over the years, she's come to see them like her own kids. She is fired as principal in \\"The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester\\" after Becky, who finally sees the error in Sue's ways, decides to expose her. Heartbroken over Becky's betrayal, she is further hurt by her mother, Doris', claim that Sue is \\"the daughter she couldn't love\\", although both of them eventually rekindles after admitting each other's misdeeds. Initially berating Will, she retaliates by joining as Vocal Adrenaline's coach, only to reveal that she deliberately creating a spectacle that would aleniate the judges to thank Will for standing up for her when she got exposed. She rekindles with Becky in the series finale. By the series finale, in 2020, Sue is the Republican Vice President of the United States to President Jeb Bush, with Becky as the head of her secret service team. She is planning on running for president in 2024. She rededicates the McKinley High auditorium to be named in honor of Finn Hudson while apologizing for her previous poor perception of the glee club. McKinley High has now become a model of excellence and other schools are copying its format. New Directions members from years past and present unite for one last massive group song, with Sue and Becky joining the entire cast for one final bow. Development Casting and creation Sue is played by Jane Lynch. The character did not exist when the script for the Glee pilot was first submitted to Fox. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ryan Murphy said that Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly was responsible for her creation. On our first call, Kevin said, \\"You need a villain, Murphy remembered. 'And I said, \\"You know, you're right.\\" I knew exactly who she is. I said, \\"Her name is Sue Sylvester. And she is the cheerleading coach. And she may be on horse estrogen. The casting notice described Sue as \\"the anal, tightly wound, and ruthlessly ambitious leader of the Harrison High cheer leading squad.\\" At the time she was cast as Sue, Lynch was already committed to do a Damon Wayans pilot for ABC. The Glee role initially had her as a guest star, in the hope that she could become a regular in the future. When the ABC pilot fell through, Lynch became a series regular. Characterization Sue is initially presented as the glee club's \\"arch-nemesis\\". Following the pilot episode, Lynch said she is \\"pure evil and doesn't hide it\\", explaining that she was created as a product of Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's \\"inner mean girl\\". Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both \\"horrible and really delightful at the same time\\", assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says. She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about \\"power and winning\\", stating that she will do anything to win. Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome. She is depicted as kind and loving towards Jean, though Lynch stated that exploration of Sue's humanity would be limited. Sue is an atheist, but according to Murphy, does not want to be. He explained, \\"She [is] saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.'\\" The second-season episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\" focuses on the characters' differing approaches to religion. Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), which Murphy describes as the scene he is \\"most proud to have been involved with in [his] entire career.\\" On the fifth-season episode \\"Puppet Master\\", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then Principal Figgins \\"insulted\\" her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to \\"try some pants\\" because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment she put the track suit on, \\"the world bowed before her\\" and that she \\"had one made in every color\\".  Musical performances  Sue duets with her mother Doris (Carol Burnett, pictured) during season two. Sue performs in several of the series' musical numbers. In the first-season episode \\"Mash-Up\\", she is given a dancing lesson by Will, to Louis Prima's \\"Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)\\". Her first vocal performance comes in the episode \\"The Power of Madonna\\", in which Sue enacts a frame-by-frame recreation of the music video for Madonna's \\"Vogue\\". The track features on the extended play record Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna, released to accompany the episode, and charted at number 106 on the UK singles chart. Sue duets with Olivia Newton-John on her song \\"Physical\\" in the episode \\"Bad Reputation\\". This track was included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers, as well as the compilation albums Glee: The Music, The Complete Season One, and Glee: The Music, The Complete Season One Collection. Also released as a single available for download, it charted both on the Billboard Hot 100 and internationally, peaking at number 89 in the US, 88 in Australia, 61 in Canada and 56 in the United Kingdom.Peak chart positions for \\"Physical\\": *US: *Australia: *Canada: *UK: During the second season, Sue duets with her mother Doris on \\"Ohio\\" from the 1953 musical Wonderful Town. The song was suggested to Murphy by Burnett, who felt that the lyrics were suited to her character's storyline. In the fourth season, Sue performs \\"Little Girls\\" from Annie in the episode \\"Lights Out\\" and a mash-up of Nicki Minaj's \\"Super Bass\\" and \\"I Still Believe by Mariah Carey as a duet with Darren Criss in the episode \\"Feud\\". Sue featured in three duets during the fifth season: \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" by Fred Astaire and \\"NYC\\" from Annie with Matthew Morrison in the episodes \\"Puppet Master\\" and \\"Opening Night\\" respectively and \\"Who Are You Now?\\" from Funny Girl with Lea Michele also in \\"Opening Night\\". Sue's final solo in the series is a cover of \\"Bitch\\" by Meredith Brooks in \\"The Hurt Locker, Part One\\". She performs another duet with Doris in \\"The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester\\": \\"The Trolley Song\\" from \\"Meet Me in St. Louis. Also featured in that episode is a duet of Europe's \\"The Final Countdown with Will. Sue's final performance is a duet with Will of ABBA's \\"The Winner Takes It All.\\" Reception Critical response Sue was lauded as \\"the greatest Broadway-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series\\" by Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker. In an early review, Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times criticized her domination of scenes and flat characterization, commenting: \\"She's funny from line to line, but there is little to her besides tin-pot contrariness.\\" In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named her one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years. She is the 100th Most Memorable Female TV Character, according to AOL TV. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Lynch's performance in the role has attracted critical acclaim. Following the pilot episode, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that she alone makes the series worth watching. IGN's Eric Goldman later assessed that a comic actress such as Lynch is necessary to make the character loveable, given that her key traits include smugness, ignorance and casual racism. The Los Angeles Times Shawna Malcom similarly praised Lynch's portrayal for keeping Sue from being \\"an over-the-top disaster.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal suggested that the show would be less fun without Lynch's delivery. Variety Brian Lowry was critical of Lynch in early episodes, deeming Glee adult cast \\"over-the-top buffoons\\", and writing that she \\"chews through her material so relentlessly as to be fitfully funny but usually just plain annoying.\\" The New York Times Mike Hale wrote that she gives a \\"one-note performance\\" in Glee, suggesting that she is miscast in the role, as \\"her talent for playing repressed nut cases doesn‚Äôt extend to playing straightforward Nazis.\\" Accolades Lynch has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Sue. At the 14th Satellite Awards, she won the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. The following year, she won Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, for her performance in the episode \\"The Power of Madonna\\".

Portrayed by actress Jayma Mays, Emma has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Emma was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is a guidance counselor at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the series is set. Emma suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and has romantic feelings for glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), but she becomes engaged to football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), as Will is married. Ken ultimately breaks up with her on their wedding day because of her feelings for Will, and when Will leaves his wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), he and Emma share a kiss. Their relationship is short-lived, and in the second season, Emma and her dentist boyfriend Carl Howell (John Stamos) marry in Las Vegas. The wedding is later annulled, as it was unconsummated. At the beginning of the third season, she and Will are living together; they become engaged shortly after New Year, and they consummate their relationship near the end of the school year. Emma leaves Will at the altar midway through the fourth season, but the two later reconcile and marry in the season finale. She becomes pregnant during the middle of the fifth season. Mays feels the character has much depth, juxtaposing Emma's position helping the students with her own phobia of germs and love for a married man. She explained that \\"the character is not a stereotypical TV-style husband-stealer who immediately would be luring the dude into the sack, but rather seems like a real person facing real issues.\\" Mays has performed several musical numbers in the show, including \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" from My Fair Lady, Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" from The Rocky Horror Show, \\"Afternoon Delight\\" by the Starland Vocal Band, and The 5th Dimension's \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\". \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" was originally Mays' audition piece; her performance of it on Glee was met with critical acclaim. The songs appear on the series' soundtrack albums and EPs. The character has been well received by critics, including Mike Hale of The New York Times, who praised Mays for being able to \\"[register] Emma's devastation with just the slightest widening of [her] enormous eyes.\\" Critics responded well to the development of Emma and Will's relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that their first kiss was \\"hard to not feel good about\\". Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly, however, suggested that it may have been \\"more intriguing\\" to leave their romance unresolved. Storylines Emma is introduced as the guidance counselor at William McKinley High School. She has romantic feelings for Spanish and glee teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), and encourages him in his attempt to revitalise the school glee club. She is dismayed to learn that Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is pregnant and that he is considering leaving the teaching profession to become an accountant, but is able to convince him to reconsider by showing him a video of him singing. In an attempt to get over Will, Emma begins dating football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), and becomes engaged to him in the episode \\"Vitamin D\\". However, when Will is unable to attend a competition with the glee club, Emma volunteers to take them in his place, and postpones her own wedding by several hours. Acknowledging her continuing feelings for Will, Ken breaks up with her on their wedding day. Emma tells Will that she has resigned from the school, as she is ashamed of her behavior with Ken, and is heartbroken that she cannot be with Will. Will tells her that he has left Terri, but Emma feels it is too soon for him to move on. Regardless, as she later prepares to leave the school, Will finds her and stops her with a kiss. Emma and Will pursue a relationship, but Emma fears that he may be repeating patterns from his relationship with Terri because of his difficulties with being alone. She reveals that she is a virgin, and though she decides to have sex with Will, she changes her mind at the last moment. Will suggests that she see a counselor for help with her debilitating issues. Emma later discovers that Will kissed another woman and verbally berates him, terminating their relationship. In the season finale, Will kisses Emma and tells her that he loves her. Emma begins a relationship with her dentist, Dr. Carl Howell (John Stamos), which leads to a Vegas wedding. Her reservations about sex lead her to become faculty advisor to the school's celibacy club. Carl arranges a meeting with sex education teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), and reveals that they have yet to sleep together. Emma confesses that she may still have feelings for Will, and Carl tells her he will be moving into a hotel until she is certain of her feelings. In \\"A Night of Neglect\\", Emma reveals to Will that Carl has left her for good and wants an annulment, since their marriage was never consummated. Because of the stress, Emma's OCD affects her far more than usual, and she feels regretful because she thought she would have overcome it by that point in her life. Will tells Emma that he will be there for her no matter what, and also urges her to get treatment for her OCD. She starts seeing a psychiatrist in the episode \\"Born This Way\\", and is showing signs of improvement by the end of season two. Over the summer, Will and Emma move in together, although they have not consummated their relationship. That they are both thinking of an eventual marriage is made clear in the episode \\"Asian F\\", and when Will invites her parents to dinner in that episode, he discovers that they are \\"ginger supremacists\\" who mock Emma's OCD, the roots of which are shown in flashbacks with them and an eight-year- old Emma. Will asks Emma to marry him in \\"Yes/No\\" and she accepts. Later that winter, a tenured position opens at McKinley High, and although Will and Sue Sylvester compete against each other for the position, it is ultimately given to Emma rather than either of them. Will and Emma finally consummate their relationship in \\"Nationals\\" after New Directions wins the show choir championship. When Will is named to a national blue-ribbon panel on the arts in Washington, DC, early in the fourth season, he expects Emma to come with him, but Emma is very reluctant to do so: she doesn't want to leave her job for several months while he's away. They ultimately agree that Emma will stay behind and the two will reunite on weekends. They also agree to get married when Will returns, but the stress of planning a big wedding proves too much for Emma, and she leaves the church before the ceremony begins. She and Will eventually reconcile, and the two finally get married in the choir room with the glee club as witnesses in \\"All or Nothing\\", after New Directions win Regionals. Following their marriage, the couple decide to have children, but are unable to conceive for several months. They are desperately trying to do so in the fifth season's tenth episode \\"Trio\\", and are caught having sex in the school by Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). At the end of the episode, Emma reveals to Will that she is pregnant. In \\"Opening Night\\" Emma gives birth to a boy, Daniel Finn Schuester. During the final season, in the episode Transitioning, she convinces a torn Will to choose what's best for him, to stay at Vocal Adrenaline with a promising salary and facility but unhappy or to stop. In a parallel episode to the Pilot, 2009, she is aware and concerned with Kurt's depression and consults with his father about it and also convinces Will to stay with the Glee Club as the kids still needs him and that it what makes him happy. In the series finale, \\"Dreams Come True\\", she is now living happily with the newly promoted Will as the principal and in the future they have more kids together. She appears at the McKinley auditorium's rededication to Finn Hudson and enjoys the final performance of the New Directions. She is visibly shocked when Will and Terri hug and together with all of the Glee Cast take a final bow. Development Casting and creation Emma is portrayed by actress Jayma Mays. In the third season episode \\"Asian F\\", Hannah Spiros plays an eight-year-old Emma. Prior to her casting in Glee, Mays was already an established actress in both the television and film industries, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act, and Mays auditioned with the song \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" from The Rocky Horror Show. Asked what originally drew her to the role of Emma, Mays said: Characterization In the first episode, it is revealed that Emma has obsessive-compulsive disorder, suffering from mysophobia, a fear of germs. The show garnered mostly praise for its portrayal of a character with OCD and for accurately depicting OCD as a serious but treatable anxiety disorder.Jeff Szymanski, OCD in the Media (June 6, 2011). WebMD; Stephanie Smith, Glee and OCD (April 27, 2011); Chris Weise, Potential for Stigma- Smashing Greatness (November 7, 2001). Erasing the Distance. Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun assessed that her phobia is \\"comical\\" and that Emma's initial role in the series is comic relief. Mays has explained that \\"the character is not a stereotypical TV-style husband-stealer who immediately would be luring the dude into the sack, but rather seems like a real person facing real issues.\\" Mays added: \\"This is something that's part of a lot of people's lives. But Emma is not a cheater. They've portrayed her as being somewhat virginal. There's purity there. She doesn't just hone in [sic] and say, 'I want to destroy this guy's relationship.' So Emma is hopeful and sad at the same time. Funny, too. Sounds like real life, where, as stated earlier, you can't help who you love.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News described her as \\"good-hearted and smart. Emma is also so obsessive-compulsive she counts the bristles on her toothbrush.\\" Mays has deemed Emma an \\"amazing\\" character to play, and has explained: \\"I don't find that female characters are always written with a lot of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing.\\" Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as \\"she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her.\\" Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: Discussing Emma's style and costuming, Glee costume designer Lou Eyrich has explained: \\"We wanted to make her look like everything's so neat‚Äîperfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. We wanted to make her stand out from the other teachers. She's always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma's also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned.\\" Relationships Emma's relationship with glee club coach Will Schuester is an integral part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode \\"Vitamin D\\": \\"Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There's a softness and a longing in them that I'm always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches.\\" Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode \\"Sectionals\\". Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together \\"very hard to not feel good about\\". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been \\"more intriguing\\" to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: \\" I would have liked to at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed.\\" Emily VanDerWerff added: \\"I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win.\\" Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: \\"The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner.\\" Jayma Mays commented of their relationship: \\"Oh no! I don't know if I can say! That's a hard question because when you see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they're supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he's a married man and Emma knows that's wrong, and she doesn't want to be a homewrecker. She doesn't want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it's all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love.\\" She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): \\"We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that's always helpful when you know the person that you're working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he's a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier.\\" Reception Variety Brian Lowry deemed the adult cast of early Glee \\"over- the-top buffoons\\", however opined that Emma offered \\"modest redemption\\". The Los Angeles Times Denise Martin called Mays as Emma \\"just as funny\\" as Lynch's Sue, and noted: \\"Emma doesn't get the zingers Coach Sue gets, but she makes me laugh just as hard.\\" Harris commented that, \\"Despite the sad seriousness of [Emma's love for Will], the tightly wound Emma [...]also is one of the funniest characters in Glee. Go figure. It's funny, because everything is kind of heavy that's going on in her life, with these phobias and this guy she loves who's married, yet she still is a bit of the comic relief.\\" Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode \\"Vitamin D\\" that she had hoped Emma would decline Ken's proposal: \\"I want Emma to be strong and know it's better to be without someone for the right reason than to be with someone for the wrong one.\\" Mike Hale for The New York Times praised Mays' performance in the episode. He noted: \\"Jayma Mays registered Emma's devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers.\\" Critics commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the \\"poignant moment\\" of the glee club's final performance \\"even more dear\\", and hoped that it would not be the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss \\"sweet [and] longing\\". Goldman wrote: \\"Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns\\". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: \\"I died\\". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: \\"That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard.\\" She called the kiss between Will and Emma \\"romantic\\" commenting that it made her \\"heart happy\\". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been \\"more intriguing\\" to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or \\"before she smiled approvingly after their kiss\\", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or \\"about freakin' time\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was critical of Emma in the show's second season. She said: \\"Emma is apparently married, but we haven't seen her husband since October, and even when he was more of a \\"fixture\\" on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who's appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven't consummated their marriage at all, and this has something to do with the fact that the show has combined Emma's germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn't make much sense and doesn't resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester's love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he's also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up.\\" Musical performances Mays' musical performance in the episode \\"Mash-Up\\" was well received by critics. Mays performed a cover version of \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" from My Fair Lady in the episode \\"Mash-Up\\", a studio recording of which was included as a bonus-track on copies of Glee: The Music, Volume 1 purchased from Target stores. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called the performance \\"lovely\\", and Andrea Reiher for Zap2it similarly praised the piece: \\"wow, she has a nice voice! She's no Julie Andrews, but she'll do.\\" Eric Goldman for IGN commented: \\"Seeing Emma sing \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" was sweet, though was it just me (or my TV), or was the volume on her vocals a bit unusually loud? I also could have done without Will's line telling her she should sing to help her keep the beat as she danced ‚Äì come on Glee, you're a musical. Embrace it and just let her sing.\\" Mays said that she \\"had fun singing,\\" but found the experience \\"terrifying,\\" as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: \\"I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But it was an interesting experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I would do it again. But I'm not going to go begging them for it.\\" In her first lead solo performance since the first season, Mays performed \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" from The Rocky Horror Show during the themed episode \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\"; it was the song she'd used when auditioning for the role of Emma. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News named it the best song of the episode, and graded it \\"A+\\". Despite finding the episode \\"abrupt, uneven [and] sanitized\\", Flandez felt that it was saved by this performance. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone remarked that having Emma in the role of Janet was \\"ideal\\", but preferred the song visually to vocally. Slant Magazine Matt Zoller Seitz disliked the change in Emma's characterization which brought about the number, and while he wrote that \\"Mays was so charming that she almost, almost saved it\\", he ultimately found the \\"motivational contortions\\" insulting to the audience. The track was included on the EP Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show. It charted at number 72 in the UK, and 96 in Canada. In season three, Mays performs \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" in the episode \\"Yes/No\\", which was described by Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle as \\"the perfect combination of a great song, plot relevance, and Princess Beatrice hat\\". TV Guide Kate Stanhope agreed with him on all three points, and added that it was \\"a great pick for her vocals\\". TVLine Michael Slezak described those vocals as \\"a breath of dewy spring air\\" and gave the song an \\"A\\", but Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly thought Emma was not \\"much of a singer\\" and gave the number a \\"B‚àí\\", though he said \\"the curiosity of backup vocals from Coach Beiste and Sue Sylvester made this entirely worthwhile\\". In season four, Mays is one of eight singers featured in the performance of \\"The Scientist\\" by Coldplay in the episode \\"The Break-Up\\". She also performed the song \\"(Not) Getting Married Today\\" from the musical Company with Morrison and Amber Riley in the episode \\"I Do\\" and \\"You're All The World to Me\\" from Royal Wedding in the following episode, again with Morrison.

The character is portrayed by actress Jessalyn Gilsig, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Terri was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is introduced as the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Her storylines have seen her experience a false pregnancy, attempt to adopt the baby of pregnant glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), and become involved in a love triangle between herself, Will and school guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). Gilsig has characterized Terri as being emotionally still in high school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She does not know how long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma. Terri has been poorly received by critics. The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan has called her \\"the worst thing about Glee\\", and the show's \\"one big flaw\\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly has described her as a \\"shrill, lying nag\\", whose main function is to bring the audience down. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, however, has praised Gilsig's acting in the role, and stated that his hatred of the character dissipated once her fake pregnancy was exposed. He noted that: \\"Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames\\", and while he still isn't \\"in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have my attention on the sidelines, as opposed to filing my nails until halftime. Baby steps, right?\\" Storylines Season 1 Terri is the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Believing herself to be pregnant, Terri pressures Will to quit his job as a Spanish teacher at William McKinley High School, in order to take a better paying job as an accountant. She later discovers she has actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy, but hides this from Will, afraid he will leave her. After she confides her deception in her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri approaches the recently revealed to be pregnant cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), with an interest in her baby. Terri briefly becomes the school nurse, albeit unqualified, and uses the position to keep a closer eye on Will, whom she believes may be cheating on her with guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). She is fired as the nurse by Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), however, after it is discovered that she has given the glee club members pseudoephedrine tablets. Terri and Kendra bully her OB-GYN (Kenneth Choi) into faking an ultrasound to convince Will the baby is real. In the episode \\"Mattress,\\" Will uncovers Terri's ruse when he discovers her pregnancy pad in a drawer. He angrily confronts her, then walks out, but remains undecided over whether to end their marriage. Terri begins attending therapy, but Will tells her he no longer loves her and is leaving her. Later, in \\"Hell-O,\\" Terri returns to warn Emma that she is not going to give Will up without a fight, and also reveals that the song that Will planned on dancing with Emma is also the song Terri and Will had danced to at their prom. Despite this attempted sabotage, Terri and Will still finalize their divorce; Terri then briefly befriends Glee member and newly hired Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) as her protegee at Sheets-N-Things, because he reminds her of a younger Will. Season 2 At the start of the second season, Terri still wants her ex- husband Will back. She is nearly run over as she confronts Will and Emma when they begin to go for a test drive in his spontaneously acquired Corvette. Terri tells Will to get out of the car and they get into an argument, which causes Emma to leave the scene. The words simmer down and Terri advises Will to return the car to the dealership, because he cannot afford it. Before leaving, she says that Emma will break Will's heart again and he'll return to her eventually. In \\"The Substitute\\", Terri returns to take care of a sick Will. They have sex, but the next day when she sees Will's substitute, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) at his apartment having a beer with him, she becomes suspicious and makes several snarky comments to Holly. Even after Terri apologizes, Will tells her it is over. A heartbroken Terri promises Will he will regret it, and she storms out of the door. In the episode \\"A Night of Neglect\\", Sue Sylvester recruits Terri for her \\"League of Doom\\", a new group that Sue hopes will help her bring down Will and the glee club before they can compete in Nationals. In \\"Funeral\\", Terri succeeds in sabotaging the club's travel plans to New York, but fixes the damage and tells Will that she has been promoted to manager for Sheets-N-Things at a location in Miami. She plans to take the job as a chance to move on with her life and give herself a fresh start in a new location. Season 4 In Season 4's Christmas episode \\"Glee, Actually\\", Terri made a cameo appearance in Artie Abrams's (Kevin McHale) dream sequence, where she successfully did her false pregnancy and Will, who is an alcoholic, is too drunk to recognize that the baby Terri is carrying is a baby doll. She also tells Artie that Emma and Ken are married and living in Hawaii. Season 6 Terri appears in the first part of the series finale, \\"2009\\", which is a parallel episode to the pilot. She is not happy that Will takes over the Glee Club and rudely dismiss Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) request to convince Will to stay for the newly reformed Glee Club, as Terri wants Will to get a better job for a better living, ignoring his dreams. In the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\", during the last moments of the series, Terri returns to Lima for the first time since season 2. She joins in to attend a rededication to the McKinley's auditorium to the late Finn Hudson and enjoys the final performance by the New Directions of all generation. She reunites with Will and takes a bow with the rest of the Glee cast. Development Casting and creation Terri Schuester is portrayed by actress Jessalyn Gilsig. Prior to her casting in Glee, Gilsig was an established actress in both the television and film industry, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. For the first two seasons of Glee, Gilsig was billed as a contract player for the show. However, it was reported that Gilsig has been bumped down to a recurring character for the show's third season, set to air in September 2011. When asked what originally drew her to the role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: \\"Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And that was one of the best experiences as an actor I‚Äôve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to ‚Äî I think go further than they‚Äôve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons‚Ä¶things I never thought I‚Äôd do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I‚Äôd love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I‚Äôve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that‚Äìwhich is kind of a big risk for me‚Äìto be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say.\\" Characterization Discussing the workplace flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri \\"a woman of conviction\\", willing to do \\"whatever it takes\\" to keep Will from leaving her, \\"even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down\\". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is \\"missing a lot of the skills for the marriage\\", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: \\"I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing.\\" Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: \\"When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [fake pregnancy] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly.\\" Gilsig referred to the confrontation between Terri and Will in the episode \\"Mattress\\" as \\"The Reckoning\\". She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: \\"What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear.\\" Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: \\"I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [in \\"Mattress\\"] Will finally reflects that he is a fully evolved human being and puts two and two together.\\" She noted that while Will and Emma \\"are adorable together\\", she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple: \\"I think that she really loves him. People do crazy things out of deep, deep insecurity. She's obviously flawed, but I think she has love in her heart.\\" Gilsig has further discussed the development of Terri's relationship with Will: Overall, while fan reaction to her character had previously resulted in a backlash Gilsig found \\"tough\\", she hoped that \\"Mattress\\" would be the episode in which \\"anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri\\". Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: \\"As long as you love to hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth.\\" Gilsig does not know how long her character will feature in the series, and has explained \\"When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun about it is that she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities.\\" Reception The critical reception of the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: \\"the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory\\", and deemed Terri the \\"biggest culprit\\". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy \\"Freudian\\" and wrote: \\"The Terri-Quinn plot sends the message that the devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate ‚Äî including lying about pregnancy.\\" Variety's Brian Lowry commented: \\"Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [Terri] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew.\\" The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan has called Terri \\"the worst thing about Glee\\", and opined: \\"As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell.\\" Ryan later deemed Terri the \\"one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: \\"manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation could there be for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?\\". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters. Robert Bianco for USA Today noted after the episode \\"Showmance\\": \\"Jessalyn Gilsig's self-centered, ridiculously strident Terri just needs to go, period.\\" Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times deemed Terri \\"beyond annoying\\" in the following episode, \\"Acafellas\\", but wrote: \\"I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig‚Äôs character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step.\\" Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode \\"Preggers\\": \\"So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far enough to make her actions entertaining, even as we root against her.\\" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode \\"Throwdown\\": \\"the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, and tonight that subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn‚Äôs real one started out a few weeks ago as an interesting way to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I‚Äôll bet the actress didn‚Äôt initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will ‚Äî and by extension, us ‚Äî down.\\" Gerrick Kennedy, in a review of \\"Mattress\\" for the Los Angeles Times, noted that in previous reviews he had \\"never been shy of [his] disdain for Mrs. Schuester\\". He called her \\"manipulative, heartless [and] shrill\\", and added that \\"this whole train wreck of a fake pregnancy just added fuel to the fire that became a raging inferno of hate for Terri.\\" He also noted: \\"Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames\\", and while he still isn't \\"in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have my attention on the sidelines, as opposed to filing my nails until halftime. Baby steps, right?\\" Kennedy praised the confrontation scene, and wrote that it was \\"devastating\\" to watch and that his hate for Terri \\"vanished\\" once the lie was over. Kennedy described: References External links * Terri Schuester at Fox.com Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Glee (TV series) characters Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Terri Schuester"},{"id":"24189524","text":"Rachel Barbra Berry is a fictional character and de facto female lead from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. The character is portrayed by actress Lea Michele, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Rachel was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is the glee club star of the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her suffer peer alienation due to her Broadway ambitions and self- absorbed, type A personality, and develop romantic feelings for Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), a member of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, but primarily for quarterback and glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), to whom she eventually becomes engaged. Michele bases Rachel on herself when she was younger, and also draws inspiration for the character variously from films including Election, and television portrayals such as the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf. \\"Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful,\\" said Michele, \\"and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be.\\" Rachel is a \\"strong, driven girl\\" but somewhat neurotic, and Glee follows Rachel's journey to become more of a team player as well as fulfil her own aspirations. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2010, and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2010 and 2011 for her performance in the role. Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics: Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised Michele for making the character \\"more than a humorless stereotype\\", though The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez has described Rachel as \\"insufferable\\". Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as singles, available for digital download, and also feature on the show's soundtrack albums. Rachel is the most frequently seen character on the series, with \\"The Role You Were Born to Play,\\" \\"Dynamic Duets\\" and \\"Shooting Star\\" (all in season 4) being the only episodes where she does not appear. Most of Rachel's songs are solos, with some being group tracks and a few being duets. About one song in every episode is led by Rachel. Depending on the theme, her song choice changes from Broadway to Top 40 to '60s music. In college, she leaned more into Broadway songs, because she was at a musical theater college, but did match mostly with whatever theme the Glee club was doing that week. Storylines Season 1 Rachel is Jewish. Her fathers named her after Rachel Green from Friends, and her middle name is in honor of Barbra Streisand. She joins the newly reconstituted glee club hoping that fame will increase her popularity and help her find a boyfriend. She is bullied by members of the school cheerleading and football teams, but is pleased when quarterback Finn Hudson joins the club, developing a crush on him. The two share a kiss in the episode \\"Showmance\\", although he tells her to forget that it happened and continues dating his girlfriend, cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). Rachel quits the glee club when she is not assigned a solo she wanted, and is awarded the lead role in the school musical, Cabaret. However, she later quits the musical and rejoins the glee club when she realizes that she would rather be in a group in which she has friends. She has a brief relationship with another glee club member, Puck (Mark Salling), who is also Jewish, and is a football player who used to bully her, but she breaks up with him due to her continuing feelings for Finn. She later discovers and reveals to Finn that Quinn's pregnancy was not caused by him, but that Puck is the father; furious, Finn attacks Puck, breaks up with Quinn, and drops out of New Directions. He returns the day of the group's first major competition, the Sectionals, to undo sabotage by cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch); the group makes up a completely new set list, which Rachel opens with a solo of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", and New Directions wins by unanimous decision. For a short time Rachel believes that she is dating Finn, but he tells her that he needs to take time out for himself. He changes his mind soon after, but Rachel has already begun dating Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), the lead singer of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline. The rest of the glee club presses Rachel to break off with Jesse, but he transfers to William McKinley and joins New Directions, which defuses their concerns. She tells Jesse that her dream is to find her birth mother, and he offers to help her do so. However, he already knows who it is: Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), who has asked Jesse to befriend Rachel so that she might reconnect with her daughter, whom she is not allowed to contact directly until Rachel is eighteen. When Rachel discovers that Shelby is her mother, they both confess to not feeling an immediate attachment and eventually decide not to pursue a relationship. Jesse betrays Rachel and returns to Vocal Adrenaline, leaving her devastated. In the episode \\"Journey to Regionals\\", as he and Rachel are about to go onstage at Regionals, Finn tells her that he loves her; although they lose the competition to Vocal Adrenaline, they become a couple. Season 2 When the glee club needs to recruit new members to get back up to the minimum twelve required for competitions, Rachel initially encourages transfer student Sunshine Corazon (Charice) to try out, but when she realizes just how good Sunshine is, she sabotages the audition, directing her to an inactive crack house instead of the true location; Sunshine ends up transferring to Carmel High and joining Vocal Adrenaline. Though this and Finn's temporary ouster from the football team test their relationship, it remains quite strong through the beginning of season two; the two work together to throw the glee club's duets competition so newcomer Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) wins instead. Rachel eventually discovers that Finn slept with cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) the previous year while Rachel was dating Jesse, and lied about it, though Rachel herself had lied and said she had slept with Jesse when she hadn't; hurt, she makes out with Puck to hurt Finn back; this betrayal causes Finn to break up with her. Rachel tries to win him back, but he instead rekindles his feelings for Quinn and starts dating her. Wounded by Quinn telling her that the two of them are back together, Rachel writes an original song for Regionals, \\"Get It Right\\", and when New Directions wins, is named the club's competition MVP. Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to the prom with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are kicked out of the prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which effectively ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, despite the fact that she and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet‚Äî\\"Pretending\\", written by Finn‚Äîan enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes. Season 3 Rachel, along with Kurt, plans to attend a performing arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they consider The New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), a highly desirable school. The two attend an Ohio \\"mixer\\" for potential applicants, only to discover that their competition is very much like them, and quite talented. Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical, since she believes herself to be a shoo-in for the lead role, Maria, and she needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria, and the directors, unable to decide between the two of them even after head-to-head callbacks, decide to double-cast the role, giving Rachel and Mercedes each a week of the two-week run. Mercedes, believing she did better in the callbacks, refuses to accept the double-casting and withdraws from the show, leaving Rachel to be Maria. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode \\"The First Time\\". In the episode \\"Mash Off\\", Rachel abruptly withdraws from the race for senior class president in favor of Kurt after she realizes he might not get into NYADA with her if he doesn't win. She goes even further in the next episode, \\"I Kissed a Girl\\", when she stuffs an election ballot box in Kurt's favor to keep him from losing. He loses anyway, and she confesses: she is suspended from school for a week and forbidden to compete in Sectionals with New Directions, though the glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode \\"Yes/No\\", Finn asks her to marry him, and after hesitating for several days, she accepts. Their parents find out in \\"Heart\\", and hope to discourage the pair, but their plans backfire and the wedding date is moved up to May. Even that date seems too distant, so Rachel and Finn later decide to marry after Regionals in \\"On My Way\\". New Directions wins at Regionals, and hours later the ceremony is about to begin at City Hall, with their parents still hoping to prevent it from occurring. Rachel is waiting for Quinn, who had gone home to get her bridesmaid dress, to arrive. Quinn's car is hit by a truck as the episode ends. The wedding is called off, though the engagement remains on. In the episode \\"Choke\\", Rachel auditions for NYADA in front of formidable judge Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg) but forgets the words to a song she has known since she was a child, and the audition abruptly ends. In \\"Prom- asaurus\\" Rachel is still upset about her choke and organizes an \\"anti-prom\\" with Kurt, Blaine, Becky and Puck. She later realizes she is missing one of the best nights of her life and attends the prom with Finn and is voted Prom Queen by secret ballot (altered by Quinn), in a similar situation to Kurt the previous year. Rachel doesn't give up on her dream and sends Carmen Tibideaux fourteen messages and pesters her to give Rachel another chance at the audition, even driving to one of Tibideaux's tryouts with Tina. Her persistence (and Tina's help) persuade Ms. Tibideaux to come and see Rachel perform with New Directions at Nationals in Chicago (unbeknownst to Rachel). In \\"Nationals\\" Rachel performs Celine Dion's \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" and gets a standing ovation from the observing Carmen Tibideaux. New Directions return to McKinley as National Show Choir Champions and Rachel presents Mr. Schuester with the Teacher of the Year award. After Rachel graduates from McKinley, she finds out that she was accepted into NYADA. However, both Finn and Kurt were rejected from their colleges. At first, she decides to defer her acceptance so that she can help them both. However, Finn takes Rachel to the train station and sacrifices their relationship for Rachel's dreams. She gets off at Grand Central and walks down the streets of New York. Season 4 In the season premiere \\"The New Rachel\\", Rachel is struggling to accept her separation from Finn. She meets Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), a handsome NYADA junior, who encourages Rachel to move on and embrace college life. Rachel also deals with her overpowering dance instructor Cassandra July (Kate Hudson), who believes that she does not have what it takes to become a star. After Kurt comes to New York, the two decide to move into together while Kurt pursues an internship with Vogue.com and plans to reapply to NYADA for the second semester. In the episode \\"Makeover\\", Rachel gets picked on by a group of female dancers for her childish appearance. With the help of Kurt and his new boss Isabelle Wright (Sarah Jessica Parker), she is convinced to get a makeover. Her new look is met with positive reception from others, including Brody, and she invites him over to dinner. Right after their first kiss, Rachel discovers Finn on her doorstep. While visiting, Rachel learns that Finn was medically discharged from the army several weeks ago and that he no longer wants to live in New York after seeing how happy she was without him. Finn takes off and goes back to Lima where Rachel confronts him and says that even though she loves him, she can no longer stay in their relationship. She and Brody begin to see each other, and she lets him move in so that they can be closer. When she returns for Will and Emma's wedding, she and Finn reconnect as friends. When Finn asks about Brody, she says that they are not exclusive. Finn says that the reason she has not committed to Brody is because, she still thinks they will end up together. They sleep together after the reception, but Rachel leaves after Finn falls asleep. She is later shown taking a pregnancy test; Santana, who has recently moved in, snoops and discovers the discarded test, and confronts Rachel, who then bursts into tears. The two go together to get Rachel checked at a clinic, where she is informed that it was a false alarm. She later breaks up with Brody after Santana reveals that he is a male escort and is stunned to find out Finn flew to New York just to beat him up. When Rachel breaks up with Brody, she admits that the relationship never would have worked because she was using it to try to get over her heartache about Finn. Rachel auditions for Funny Girl and sings \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", imagining the original New Directions members singing in the background. She is called back for further auditions for the title role, Fanny Brice. In the finale, Rachel sings \\"To Love You More\\" at the final callback before the role is cast. Season 5 In \\"The Quarterback\\", Rachel is devastated with the loss of Finn. Michele, who in real life was dating Cory Monteith, had asked to postpone this episode until everyone was ready. Rachel doesn't appear in this episode until the very end where she states, \\"Before Finn, I used to sing alone, this was one of the songs we would sing when we drove around together.\\" She sings \\"Make You Feel My Love\\". Later in the episode, she states that Finn was her person and that they were always going to be together. Later in the season, it is revealed that she got a tattoo of Finn's name (despite telling Kurt that she chickened out when they went to the tattoo shop). Rachel hires Santana to be her publicist, which leads her to take on a charitable cause with a local rescue kennel. She performs with Mercedes and Santana on stage for the benefit, Broadway Bitches, but the publicity stunt goes wrong when the dogs pull her down and drag her for several blocks. Despite this, Santana reassures her and they discuss the next step in their campaign. Rachel lands the lead on the Broadway show, Funny Girl. Santana offers to be Rachel's understudy when Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles for a television show audition. Before the opening, she suffers from a bout of self-doubt, but performs after Santana gives her a pep talk. Lee Paulblatt, a Fox Television executive, sees Rachel perform, and is so impressed, he informs her wants to cast her in an upcoming, untitled television pilot. He has her meet with the famed screenwriter, Mary Halloran, who will be creating the script. After the first meeting, Rachel is confused by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Rachel has the group review Mary's script, and everyone agrees it is terrible (except Brittany). Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. Eventually, the network loves the script and calls Rachel, and she moves to LA to start shooting her pilot. Season 6 In the final season premiere, \\"Loser Like Me\\", it is revealed that Rachel's pilot bombed. It got extremely low ratings and the show was quickly cancelled. Having burned her bridges on Broadway, Rachel retreats home to Lima and discovers that her fathers are divorcing and her house is being sold. Much to her dismay, Sue has disbanded all arts from McKinley and Rachel approaches the Superintendent to reboot the glee club with her remaining TV money to fund it. He agrees as long as she runs the club. With the help of the newly broken-up Kurt, she restarts the New Directions, which angers Sue. She calls her old friends and former fellow glee club members Quinn, Santana, Brittany, Puck, Artie, Mercedes, and Tina to help her, and Kurt recruits students to join the glee club; he gets one student, Roderick, to audition. Blaine, the head coach for the Dalton Academy Warblers, desperately tries to get a female student named Jane to join the Warblers, despite the members' objections. Jane eventually chooses to transfer to McKinley to join the New Directions after a brief coaching with Rachel, much to Blaine's dismay. By the end, Rachel has 4 members of the glee club. During her time as McKinley's faculty, she bonds with Sam, who is the assistant of Coach Beiste, and develops a crush on him, despite him only being hypnotized by Sue to distract Rachel. Sam backs off, stating he is still in love with Mercedes, which makes her sad. By Mercedes' suggestion, she auditions for Broadway again. Rachel struggles to move on from her old house after it is sold, and her friends and students cheer her up with a farewell party. Later, Rachel plans on applying for readmission to NYADA, and she is accepted, but is torn between Broadway or college. Despite Jesse St. James' suggestion that she work with him on a Broadway musical, she chooses NYADA. She announces that after Regionals is over, she will be departing from McKinley to go back to NYADA again. At the beginning of the series finale, \\"Dreams Come True\\", she is seen going to the New Directions competition to assist them. She does make it big on Broadway, marries Jesse, and becomes a surrogate mother to Kurt and Blaine's child. She wins a Tony Award, and thanks everyone on stage, especially Mr. Schuester. In the final minutes of the series, she performs OneRepublic's \\"I Lived\\" with almost every former member of New Directions and the adults during the rededication of McKinley's auditorium to Finn Hudson. Rachel then takes a final bow with the rest of the cast. Development Casting and creation Rachel is regularly portrayed by Lea Michele, and as a child has been played by Lauren Boles. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. In an interview with The Washington Post, Michele commented on her casting, saying, \\"I was kind of just thrown into this‚Äîthis is one of the first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing‚Äîshe performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience.\\" In December 2010, Ryan Murphy announced that the cast of Glee would be replaced at the end of the season 3 to coincide with their graduation. Murphy said, \\"Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot.\\" He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012, \\"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\\" Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season, and Michele commented on the matter, saying, \\"We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!\\" However, Falchuk later stated that while Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith, will graduate at the end of the third season, \\"Because they're graduating doesn't mean they're leaving the show.\\" Falchuk insisted, \\"It was never our plan or our intention to let them go... They are not done with the show after this season.\\" Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly commented on the original news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate, and said, \\"Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, which is not to say they couldn't be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights... or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?\\" Characterization She took the role because of Rachel's characterization, and explained, \\"Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heart‚ÄîI think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are.\\" Michele described the first thirteen episodes of the series as \\"Rachel's journey of finding herself within the Glee club\\", and said that \\"she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's sometimes a little misunderstood.\\" Glee costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, \\"Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election‚Äîvery buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong.\\" Michele bases Rachel on herself when she was younger, and also draws inspiration from the film Election, and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester). She has explained, \\"[Blair] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't matter anyway.\\" Reception Critical response A number of songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as singles. Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as singles, available for digital download, also featuring on the soundtracks Glee: The Music, Volume 1 and Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. The role saw Michele nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series at the 2010 ceremony, which were hosted on August 29; and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards. Robert A. George of the New York Post has deemed Rachel \\"the only female [in Glee] who doesn't come across as manipulative or vapidly helpless\\", while the Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote, \\"Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless stereotype.\\" Denise Martin of the Los Angeles Times commented in her review of the episode \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\", \\"If there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel\\". Following the episode \\"Hairography\\" in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for negatively highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters. He said that while he understood this stance, he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly. However, he wrote that \\"it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic.\\" Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: \\"when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships.\\" Conversely, Ghosh assessed her low point as being her romancing of Will, writing, \\"Sure, Schue's got it going on, what with the rapping, the break dancing, the boy band'ing and the lindy hopping too. But Rachel's eye-on-the- prize, I'll-get-what-I-want attitude coupled with her inappropriate crush on the teacher just made her creepier than usual. Infiltrating his home, cooking and cleaning for him right under his crazy wife's nose. Come on, Berry, you're better than that...\\" Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode \\"Preggers\\", \\"Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bonafide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to the rest of Glee.\\" Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, \\"It's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel\\". James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel's negative character traits may actually be an asset, commenting on her performance of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" in the episode \\"Sectionals\\", \\"The number reminded me how much I like what the show's done with Rachel: she's a lead character, yet the show allows her to be annoying‚Äîbut at the same time, her dedication makes her likeable. And as we see here, as much of a pill as she can be, her ability to whip out a performance she's been working on since age four is an asset.\\" AfterEllen.com ranked her No. 18 in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Accolades Lea Michele as Rachel Berry, performing \\"Somebody to Love\\". Michele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. At the 2009 Satellite Awards, she won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series.

That's just awesome.\\" She was nominated again for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards.

Series creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan initially conceived of him as a fashionable gay countertenor who is routinely bullied at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor Chris Colfer, and has appeared as a character on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Glee follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio, of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the first season focus on his struggle with his sexuality as he comes out to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for Finn Hudson, the straight co-captain of the glee club. In the show's second season, Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a closeted classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer Blaine Anderson. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \\"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\\" by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post. Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the third season. In the fourth season, Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend Rachel Berry, where he pursues his musical education while interning for Vogue.com. For the remainder of the series, Glee charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realizing his career ambitions. Colfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident \\"I'm better than you\\" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager. Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs‚Äîusually show tunes‚Äîtraditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex‚Äîbut always loving‚Äîrelationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 Time 100, Time's list of the 100 most influential people. Casting and creation Prior to being cast in Glee, Colfer had no professional acting experience. He originally auditioned for the role of Artie Abrams, performing \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, \\"I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he‚Äôd been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't.\\" Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is \\"completely mind-blowing\\". Colfer added, \\"For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it.\\" After being cast, Colfer said that he was happy \\"to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time\\", and added, \\"It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up.\\" Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen at the time of the audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was \\"so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback\\". Kurt has also been shown even younger‚Äîin the episode \\"The Substitute\\", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children. In December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of Glee would be replaced at the end of the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, \\"Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot.\\" He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: \\"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\\" Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, \\"We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming.\\" However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation did not mean that they would leave the show. Falchuk insisted that \\"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season.\\" Storylines Season 1 In the show's pilot episode, Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by performing \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" from Chicago. Although he initially hides his homosexuality, many of the other members assume he is gay. He confides that he is gay to fellow glee club member Mercedes (Amber Riley) in \\"Acafellas\\", and the two develop a close friendship. In the following episode, \\"Preggers\\", Kurt joins the school football team as a kicker in order to impress his widowed father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), and helps the failing team win its first game by kicking the tie-breaking extra point. His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his sexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay. Kurt quits the football team in \\"Mash-Up\\", when Coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team. Kurt competes against the glee club's star singer Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) for a solo on \\"Defying Gravity\\" from the musical Wicked. However, after Burt receives a phone call labeling his son \\"a fag\\", Kurt intentionally misses the song's high note in order to lose the competition and save his father from further harassment. In the episode \\"Ballad\\", Kurt is teamed with club member and quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), for whom he harbors romantic feelings. He is aware that Rachel is also attracted to Finn, and attempts to sabotage her chances with him by giving her a bad makeover. In \\"The Power of Madonna\\", Kurt and Mercedes, dissatisfied with their limited solo opportunities within the glee club, become singers for the school's cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Although Mercedes soon resigns from the squad, Kurt stays through the National cheerleading competition, and performs a major solo in the routine that wins the Cheerios their sixth consecutive national championship. Kurt introduces his father to Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in the hope that if the two began dating, it would bring Kurt closer to Finn. Finn is initially unhappy when he finds out his mother is in a serious relationship, but he soon bonds with Burt over sports and other traditionally masculine activities. Kurt, who becomes jealous over their growing relationship, briefly attempts to reclaim his father's attention by acting more masculine: he imitates Burt's style of dress, asks him for advice on performing songs by his favorite artist, John Mellencamp, and arranges to have Burt walk in on him kissing cheerleader and glee club member Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris). In the episode \\"Theatricality\\", Burt invites Carole and Finn to move in with him and Kurt. Aware of Kurt's attraction to him, Finn is uncomfortable with sharing a bedroom with Kurt. In the hopes of pleasing Finn, Kurt redecorates their bedroom, but Finn is appalled by its fancy appearance and lack of privacy. During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings \\"faggy\\". Burt overhears Finn's words, angrily berates Finn, and throws him out. However, at the end of the episode, when two bullies are about to attack Kurt, Finn redeems himself by defending him. Season 2 Burt suffers a heart attack early in the second season. He is comatose for several days, and Kurt is terrified that he might lose him. When members of the glee club sing religious songs to comfort him, Kurt, who does not believe in God, feels alienated, and lashes out at them. Burt eventually regains consciousness, and Kurt takes charge of his recovery. In the episode \\"Duets\\", Kurt suspects new glee club member and transfer student Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is gay and recruits Sam to be his teammate in the club's duets competition. Finn attempts to dissuade Kurt from partnering with Sam by predicting that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting the club if he sings a duet with another male student. After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a \\"duet\\" with himself, singing \\"Le Jazz Hot!\\" from Victor/Victoria. With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it is for him to be the only publicly gay student at school. She reminds Kurt that the club members value him highly and that he is not alone, and asks him to sing the Judy Garland / Barbra Streisand duet of \\"Get Happy\\" and \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" with her. The storyline pairing Kurt and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss, pictured) ran for most of the second season. In \\"Never Been Kissed\\", Kurt goes to spy on the Dalton Academy glee club, the Warblers‚ÄîNew Directions' primary competition for Sectionals‚Äîand meets openly gay student Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), who then flirts with him while singing lead in a Warblers performance of \\"Teenage Dream\\". Kurt tells Blaine that he is being tormented by a homophobic bully at his high school, and Blaine convinces him to stand up for himself. When the bully, Dave Karofsky, throws Kurt against a locker, Kurt confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, Kurt shoves him away. Kurt and Blaine try to talk to Karofsky about being gay and closeted, but he denies the kiss. The bullying intensifies, and Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt if Kurt reveals their kiss to anyone. After Burt learns about Karofsky's threat to his son, Karofsky is expelled. Burt and Carole get married, but when Karofsky's expulsion is reversed by the school board, the newlyweds decide to spend the money they had saved for their honeymoon on tuition to transfer Kurt to Dalton Academy, which enforces a zero-tolerance policy against bullying. At Dalton, Kurt joins the Warblers. When the Warblers and New Directions meet at the show choir Sectionals competition, they tie for first place, making both groups eligible for Regionals. Kurt and Blaine become good friends, and Kurt soon falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine is initially oblivious to Kurt's regard. However, in the episode \\"Original Song\\", Blaine realizes his true feelings for Kurt, and they share a kiss. To Kurt's disappointment, the Warblers lose to New Directions at the Regionals competition. He transfers back to McKinley in \\"Born This Way\\" after Karofsky starts an anti-bullying club with glee club member Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), and personally assures Kurt that he regrets his earlier threats. Kurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in \\"Prom Queen\\". The attendees greet Karofsky's election as Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an overwhelming number of unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment‚Äî\\"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton\\"‚Äîgarners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy in front of his classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to come out at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is playing, and from the stage they sing \\"For Good\\", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another. Season 3 Blaine gives in to Kurt's urgings and wishes and transfers to McKinley High so they can spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides to run for the office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue. In \\"The First Time\\", Kurt and Blaine discuss whether or not to have sex. When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in West Side Story, he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar‚Äîhe supplies the fake IDs‚Äîand spends half the night dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time. In the episode \\"Michael\\", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song \\"Bad\\". Sebastian, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to steal Blaine from Kurt, throws a slushie laced with rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine jumps in front of Kurt and is badly injured by it; the cornea in his right eye is deeply scratched and requires surgery. Neither group ultimately uses Jackson's music at Regionals, and New Directions wins the competition. Later, Kurt succeeds in becoming a finalist for NYADA, as does Rachel. In \\"Dance with Somebody\\", Kurt feels that Blaine has been distant, and confides in a boy named Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off instantly with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how they feel about their situation with Blaine singing \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\" and Kurt singing \\"I Have Nothing\\" as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever. In \\"Goodbye\\", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and moves off to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA. Season 4 In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York after she reveals that she is unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up. Kurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a \\"kiki.\\" When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing \\"Being Alive\\" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in. At Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie. When Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing \\"Sunshine of My Life\\" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little. Season 5 In the season premiere, \\"Love, Love, Love\\", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine. Emboldened, Blaine decides to ask Kurt to marry him, which he does in an extravagant proposal at Dalton Academy, in the spot where the two met. Kurt accepts. He is back in New York in \\"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds\\", and gets a job at the diner where Rachel and Santana are working. He then returns to Lima in \\"The Quarterback\\" for his stepbrother Finn's funeral and subsequent memorial, and he grieves with his parents and friends. Season 6 At the start of the season, Kurt who has broken up with Blaine, returns to Lima because he still loves Blaine. When he returns, he meets up with Blaine and says that he wants them to get back together. Unfortunately, Blaine says that he is dating someone - Dave Karofsky. Kurt starts dating an older guy Walter who he met online. Sue Sylvester, who ships ‚ÄúKlaine‚Äù, locks them in an elevator and doesn't let them out until they kiss. After a few hours pass, they share a passionate kiss and agree that it doesn't mean anything. At Rachel's party, they sing a duet and afterwards Blaine kisses him. Blaine still loves Kurt so he breaks up with Dave. Blaine went to confess his love for Kurt but because Kurt is dating Walter he scraps the idea. Before Brittany's and Santana's wedding Kurt tells Blaine that he still loves him and wants them to get back together. Blaine says the same thing and they kiss. They go to the wedding as a couple. At the wedding Santana and Brittany insist that they should get married. At first they think it's a crazy idea but at the two's insistence, Kurt and Blaine get married alongside them. In 2020, they are still married and are a celebrity couple. Rachel is pregnant with their child, who is assumed to be a girl. Characterization The scene where Kurt comes out is taken verbatim from the life of Glee creator Ryan Murphy (pictured). According to Colfer, Glees creators initially \\"were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant\\". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach \\"because it's so overdone\\". Instead, he decided to portray the character as \\"more internal and superior.\\" Colfer has explained that Kurt \\"puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona,\\" but that \\"underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point.\\" Colfer also commented, \\"In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes.\\" In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is \\"very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion\\", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer Marc Jacobs before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode. The second-season episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\" centered around Kurt's atheism, with Murphy explaining that Kurt is \\"saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God. Kurt reveals himself to be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken verbatim from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was \\"a great thing to put on television\\", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who \\"wins and triumphs\\". He further explained, \\"The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I've done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough.\\" Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt \\"honest\\" and not comical or \\"used as a punchline\\". He explained, \\"I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV.\\" Kurt's acute sense of fashion is exhibited in his on-screen wardrobe. Glees costume designer Lou Eyrich said in an interview with the Seattle Times that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: \\"He never, ever repeats and you get to push yourself creatively. He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything.\\" Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that \\"exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism\\", mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, \\"he doesn't have a lot of money\\". Relationships Kurt has a close relationship with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, \\"Preggers\\". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together. Kurt has twice fallen in love. The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode \\"Acafellas\\", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that he does have feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn. After Kurt hints to Finn of his attraction, their friendship becomes strained as Finn resists Kurt's machinations to get them together. The episode in which Burt defends his son against Finn's name-calling prompted a response from Eric Goldman of IGN, who declared it \\"one of the heaviest scenes Glee has ever delved into\\". Before production on the second season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, a member of the rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, \\"Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season.\\" Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song \\"Blackbird\\" in \\"Original Song\\", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, \\"We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up.\\" When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing \\"as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's.\\" This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: \\"They're solid. They have problems‚Äîyou have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there.\\" In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, \\"I love you\\", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt‚ÄìBlaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named \\"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\\" late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post. In a July 2012 interview with E! News, Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, \\"I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that.\\" In September 2012, Criss echoed Colfer's sentiment, \\"We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!\\" To begin the show's fourth season, Kurt moves to New York while Blaine continues to go to high school in Ohio, though he and Blaine remain a couple. However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine. Despite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, \\"Love Love Love\\", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately. Kurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale. At the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back. When Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, \\"A Wedding\\". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding. They continue through the rest of the sixth season as a wed couple and in the season six finale, \\"Dreams Come True\\", it is revealed that five years in the future, Rachel is carrying their child, a daughter. Musical performances As Kurt, Colfer features in many songs that have been released as singles available for digital download and are also included in the show's soundtrack albums. In the episode \\"Wheels\\", Kurt performs \\"Defying Gravity\\" from the Broadway musical Wicked. Murphy selected \\"Defying Gravity\\" for the episode after Colfer related a story in which his own high school drama teacher had refused him the opportunity to perform the song because it was written to be sung by a female singer. Murphy explained, \\"I found a way to write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is.\\" Colfer stated that the opportunity to sing the song \\"meant the world\\" to him, and that \\"it's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's probably one of the most honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter.\\" Colfer's recording of the performance was released as a single, as well as two additional versions‚Äîone sung by co-star Michele, and another that was arranged as a duet for the two singers. The duet version charted at number thirty-one on the Billboard Hot 100, and was included on the show's first soundtrack album, Glee: The Music, Volume 1. Colfer as Kurt performing The Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" during the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour In \\"Grilled Cheesus\\", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it would have been easy to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti- religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said he \\"found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father\\", but Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode. In \\"Special Education\\", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album. Kurt and Blaine perform the duet \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" during the Christmas-oriented episode \\"A Very Glee Christmas\\". The number was released on Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album, and although it was not also released as a single, it nevertheless reached number fifty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100. As a Dalton Academy Warbler, Kurt sings the harmony line to Blaine's lead in \\"Animal\\" by Neon Trees in the episode \\"Sexy\\", and in \\"Original Song\\" he sings \\"Blackbird\\" by The Beatles. He also sings primary lead in a duet version of \\"Candles\\" by Hey Monday, with Blaine as the other lead. All three songs were included on the soundtrack Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers, released on April 19, 2011. Colfer's performances have been well received by critics, particularly \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\" in the episode \\"Born This Way\\". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic stated that the song was \\"absolutely stunning in every conceivable way\\". She thought that he had the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability \\"down pat\\". Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez also praised the rendition: \\"Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than I recall. ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't think could have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble.\\" In his review, Michael Slezak of TVLine commended Kurt's voice and gave the song an \\"A\\": \\"I feel like we haven‚Äôt had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer‚Äôs countertenor to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit.\\" Rolling Stone Erica Futterman wrote that it was \\"a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there\\". Reception Critical response Kurt has received mainly positive reviews from television critics, with many saying that Colfer's portrayal (along with Jane Lynch's performance as Sue Sylvester) stole the show from lead actress Lea Michele as Rachel Berry. James Poniewozik, writing for Time, deemed his coming out \\"beautifully handled\\" and praised the series for subverting expectations with Burt's acceptance. Rick Bentley of McClatchy Newspapers praised Colfer's performance in the episode \\"Home\\" and deemed him deserving of an Emmy nomination. IGN Robert Canning noted that \\"Grilled Cheesus\\", which focuses on Kurt's atheism and his father's heart attack, showed again that the Hummels' relationship was \\"the most affecting\\" of the show. Poniewozik appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt in the episode and also named their relationship one of Glee \\"strongest and most nuanced relationships\\". The primary criticism by CNN Lisa Respers France of that episode was that it appeared to be an Emmy submission showpiece for Colfer. She said that \\"Grilled Cheesus\\" felt forced and disliked Kurt's angry \\"overwrought\\" reaction to his friends' prayers. Christie Keith, writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com, praised Kurt's storylines and suggested that Colfer should win an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Kurt dealing with his identity. Critics were polarized by Kurt's storyline in the episode \\"Never Been Kissed\\". NPR Linda Holmes found it \\"absurd\\" that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt so quickly and described it as \\"emotionally and behaviorally unsound\\". Leah Anthony Libresco of the Huffington Post called the episode \\"extraordinarily counterproductive\\", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt \\"misleading and dangerous\\", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves. Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light- hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: \\"probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the Glee kids\\". The love story involving Kurt and Blaine was met with critical acclaim, especially the events in the \\"Original Song\\" episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, \\"It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy.\\" The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, \\"It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold the hell out of the moment. It‚Äôs long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery.\\" Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was \\"sweet\\" and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a \\"sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment\\". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors \\"handled it with dignity and honesty\\". Critics were enthusiastic about Kurt and Blaine's decision to have sex for the first time in \\"The First Time\\" episode. Canning said that Kurt and Blaine's \\"attempts to get a little wild\\", and \\"trying to grow up faster than they should\\", were \\"the better parts of the episode as they felt the most realistic\\". Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a \\"very faithful and honest scene\\". Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV was impressed by the way the characters' relationship \\"inspires gay youth in a way that we haven't seen on network television yet\\" and called them \\"amazing role models for all teens\\", and The Atlantic writer Kevin Fallon said it was \\"remarkable\\" and a \\"milestone\\" that \\"the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple\\".

The character is portrayed by actor Kevin McHale, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Artie was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. He is a guitarist and paraplegic manual wheelchair user, who is a member of the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Artie uses a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury he received in a car crash at the age of eight. His storylines have seen him accept his disability, pine for the affections of fellow New Directions members, and dabble in film directing. As Artie, McHale features in many musical performances, which have been released as singles, available for download. McHale joined Glee from a dance background, and found it challenging to adapt to using a wheelchair, but was able to utilize his dancing ability in the episode \\"Dream On\\", in which Artie dances in a shopping mall during a fantasy flash mob sequence. McHale stated that performing as Artie has made him more aware of the challenges that people with disabilities face, and was grateful to showcase how Artie can \\"still do everything everyone else can that matters\\". Storylines Artie is introduced in \\"Pilot\\" as a guitar-playing member of the William McKinley High School glee club. He uses a wheelchair, and is constantly bullied by members of the school football team. He is also in the school's jazz ensemble, and it is later revealed that he is in the A.V. Club and a member of the Academic Decathlon team as well. During preparations for the Sectionals round of show choir competition, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) decrees that there is no money in the school budget to hire a handicap- accessible bus to transport the glee club. The other students hold a fund- raising bake sale, but although they make enough money to hire a bus, Artie requests that they donate it to the school to pay for more wheelchair ramps in order to benefit future students. He goes on a date with club member Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), who stutters, and explains that he was left paralyzed following a car crash when he was eight years old. The two share a kiss, but Artie is hurt when Tina confesses she has been faking her speech impediment since the sixth grade. He later forgives Tina, but makes sexist remarks about her fashion sense, demanding that she begin wearing skimpier clothes if she wants to be with him. Tina publicly confronts him for this behavior, and Artie apologizes; they kiss and become a couple. When Tina learns that Artie's dream is to become a dancer, she asks him to perform in a tap dancing routine with her despite his paralysis, but their attempt fails miserably, and Artie asks Tina to leave. She later presents him with research on the progress of spinal cord injury treatments, raising Artie's hopes that he may soon be able to walk again, but guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) reminds him that testing for these treatments will take many years. Artie comes to accept that he may never be a dancer, and tells Tina to choose another dance partner. Artie is dismayed when New Directions lose at Regionals, but thankful for having been a member of the glee club, admitting that Tina was his first kiss. At the beginning of the second season, Artie asks Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) to help him join the football team. He hopes to win back Tina, who has broken up with him to date Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.). The new football coach, Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), believes that Finn is colluding against her by forcing her to reject a wheelchair-dependent student, and drops Finn from the team. After re-considering she accepts them both. Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) pairs with Artie for the duets assignment and competition, and they start dating. Artie loses his virginity to Brittany, but before they compete Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) tells him that Brittany only wanted him for his voice so she could win the competition. He is deeply upset that his first sexual experience was the consequence of such motivations, so he breaks up with Brittany and dissolves their partnership. Artie later realizes he wants her back, and with encouragement from Puck, they start a real relationship. Later, Artie confronts Brittany: he becomes upset that Brittany cannot recognize that she is cheating on him with Santana, and calls her stupid. Artie deeply regrets his words and tries to salvage their relationship, but she refuses. At the beginning of the third season, Artie, now a junior, is asked to direct the school musical, West Side Story. Though assailed by self-doubt at the last minute, he is thanked by the cast, and he thanks them for trusting him. At the end of the school year, Artie and the others lead New Directions to victory at the Nationals competition. In the first episode of the fourth season, Artie chooses the new lead singer of New Directions, Blaine. Brittany runs for senior class president and picks Artie as her vice president, though they lose to Blaine and Sam. Finn returns to McKinley, and Artie visits him at work and asks him to help direct Grease, which Finn accepts. In the episode \\"Glee, Actually\\", after Artie injures himself on an icy ramp, he is angry and humiliated, and wishes he'd never had to be in a wheelchair. A subsequent dream, in which he imagines himself walking, but where New Directions failed to get off the ground without his presence, makes him realize his importance to the club. He began dating his underclassman and fellow glee club member Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) at the beginning of the fifth season, but broke up with her after he graduated in the mid season, right after the glee club was disbanded. He goes to a film school in New York. In the final season, Artie, still at the film school, comes back to McKinley to help Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) recruit new members for the newly rebooted glee club. He occasionally returns to help the glee club during the season, and also attending Santana and Brittany's wedding. In \\"2009\\", the parallel episode to the \\"Pilot\\", it is revealed that he auditions for the glee club with the song \\"Pony\\", and that he (along with Tina) auditions because they were dared by their goth friends to do so. Artie is a successful film director as of the series finale, \\"Dreams Come True\\". His film, which stars Tina (who is also revealed to be his girlfriend), got into Slamdance Film Festival in 2020. He returns to McKinley to attend a rededication to McKinley's auditorium to the late Finn Hudson and performs I Lived with every former members of the New Directions for the final time and then takes a bow with the rest of the Glee Cast. Development Kevin McHale (pictured) plays Artie Abrams on Glee. McHale auditioned for Glee coming from a boy-band background, having previously been part of the group Not Like Them. He found it challenging to adapt to using a wheelchair, having to overcome the instinctive urge to dance along or tap his foot during musical performances. He finds it difficult to watch his colleagues dancing while he uses a wheelchair, but still learns the same dance routines as the other cast members, and is able to stand in the event of absences. McHale took part in the 2010 Glee Live! In Concert! tour, performing in character as Artie and remaining in a wheelchair during live performances. He also performed in a wheelchair when the Glee cast were invited to perform at the White House for the Obama family and guests in April 2010. McHale was able to utilize his dancing background in the episode \\"Dream On\\", in which Artie dances in a shopping mall during a fantasy flash mob sequence. He enjoyed the performance, but took time to pick up the choreography having spent so long working in a wheelchair. Although McHale prefers contact lenses, he auditioned for the part wearing glasses to enhance the \\"nerd\\" element of Artie's personality, and thick glasses are now a part of his costume. McHale describes Artie as a \\"nerd\\" who loves the glee club whole‚Äìheartedly and uses it as a form of escapism. He believes that Artie has more confidence than he himself possesses, explaining: \\"I think he knows who he is and he doesn't care what anyone thinks.\\" He enjoyed Artie's character development in the episode, Wheels explaining that when he was cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him. He believed that Artie became paralyzed later in life, rather than being born that way, which was proven correct in \\"Wheels\\". Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina, McHale opined: \\"I think Tina and Artie will be together. I think they will be a couple for a long time.\\" He explained that from the beginning of the show's production, creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure \\"why he was being so dramatic\\". He concluded however: \\"I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do.\\" McHale is close to his co‚Äìstar Jenna Ushkowitz, and the two of them are in support of the relationship between their characters, referred to by the portmanteau \\"Artina\\", for Artie and Tina. McHale described Artie and Tina's relationship as being similar to the one between Cory (Ben Savage) and Topanga (Danielle Fishel) in the ABC comedy‚Äìdrama Boy Meets World, and believes they will always be together. Artie, like a number of the students at McKinley High, is the \\"namesake\\" of one of Brad Falchuk's high school friends at Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. He was named for Arthur Stroyman, who helped Falchuk make horror films when they were teens. Stroyman wasn't much like Artie, however: he was a jock who \\"never fully understood the artsy kids\\" in high school. Musical performances As Artie, Mchale features in many musical performances, which have been released as singles, available for download. In the episode \\"Wheels\\" he has his first solo performance on the show \\"Dancing With Myself\\". Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to \\"break away from being misunderstood by everyone\\" and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually \\"a very secure guy\\" who does not care about others' opinions of him, \\"Wheels\\" sees his friends take his disability for granted: \\"So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is who I am, and this is who I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him more aware of the challenges that people with disabilities face: \\"It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am to be able to get up between each take and walk around. I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters.\\" In the episode \\"Dream On\\", Artie performs \\"The Safety Dance\\" and \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\", which received generally positive reviews. Aly Semigran of MTV noted that McHale's songs \\"proved he was a force to be reckoned with\\", and called the \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" duet \\"goosebump-inducing\\", observing: \\"Pretty sure that's what musical theater lovers' dreams are made of.\\" Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack called \\"Safety Dance\\" one of his favorite moments of the episode, deeming it a \\"joyous, huge performance‚Äîdefinitely one of the most elaborate numbers the show has done before.\\" In the episode, \\"Britney/Brittany\\", he performs \\"Stronger\\" by Britney Spears. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly deemed it his favorite performance of the episode, as well as the best incorporation of Britney Spears' music, as the song served Artie's storyline. He praised the increased use of McHale as a vocalist in the second season, enjoying his soulful voice. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal also enjoyed it, appreciating the twist of having males sing a feminist empowerment song. In \\"Never Been Kissed\\", Artie performs One Love/People Get Ready as a duet with Puck (Mark Salling), which received generally positive reviews. BuddyTV's Jen Harper enjoyed the harmonies and simple arrangement of \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\", and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News gave it an \\"A\\", with praise for the vocals. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly graded it \\"B-\\". He called it a \\"nice performance\\", but incongruous in context, a concern shared by Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone. Artie (McHale, pictured) performed a mash-up of \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and was said to outshine \\"even Mike and Will who dance beside him\\". In \\"Rumours\\", Artie performs \\"Never Going Back\\", which was very well received. Futterman said it was \\"better than Artie's post-Tina 'Stronger, and John Kubicek of BuddyTV declared it \\"proof that he's quite good at hitting emotional notes\\", while Semigran said she was \\"blown away\\". Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez and Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times both gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", while Brett Berk's of Vanity Fair gave it all five stars. In the episode \\"Prom Queen\\", Artie performs \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", which was as enthusiastically received‚Äîit was Meghan Brown's of The Atlantic \\"favorite number\\", and she added that Artie's \\"voice sounded great\\". It was also Berk's favorite; he commented, \\"I still melt at Artie's serenade\\", and gave it four stars out of five. Both Gonzalez and Benigno gave it an \\"A\\", and the latter explained: \\"the arrangement ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel\\", and \\"this nerdy white boy has himself some soul.\\" Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row \\"is a tad boring\\". In \\"Yes/No\\", Artie performs a mash-up of \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\". Flandez called it one of the episode's \\"highlights\\", and Billboard Rae Votta lauded Ariey's \\"Jagger moves while sitting in a chair\\" and said he \\"outshines even Mike and Will who dance beside him\\". MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan described Artie as \\"consistently awesome\\", and TVLine Michael Slezak said it was \\"one of Artie's more appealing musical moments this season\\" and gave it a \\"B\\". Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch characterized the song as a \\"spunky diversion\\" and gave it a \\"B+\\", but he noted it was \\"not a good song for marriage proposals by any stretch of the imagination\\", a point also made by Futterman, who said the number would have \\"fared much better as a stand- alone performance\\". McHale's performance of \\"Scream\\" in \\"Michael\\" inspired several reviewers, including Kate Stanhope of TV Guide and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell, to write of their regret that McHale could not dance more often on the show. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times said he was \\"a sorely underused Glee resource\\" and called the number \\"the best dance moment\\" of the episode, and Bell declared, \\"I have one word for this number: Epic.\\" The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez called it a \\"phenomenal job\\", and Stanhope cited \\"killer performances\\" by McHale on this number and others as evidence that with Artie only a junior \\"there is life\\" in New Directions after McKinley's current seniors graduate. Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly called the number \\"awesome\\" and gave it an \\"A+\\", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg described it as \\"a perfect example of what the show looks like when it's firing on all cylinders\\"; both reviewers praised the dancing of both performers. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the performance \\"lacked the energy and genuine aggression of the original Michael/Janet Jackson collaboration, although at least Kevin McHale and Harry Shum Jr. got to show off their dance skills\\", and gave it a \\"C\\". Reception Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode \\"Vitamin D\\" positively, praising the focus it gave Artie: \\"Until now, the wheelchair-bound character has served mostly as a punchline. Last night, he got a much-deserved moment in the spotlight, and he rolled with it, doing his best Richie Sambora on the talk box, then taking lead vocals on the Usher track.\\" The episode \\"Wheels\\", which placed focus on Artie and his disability, drew criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting an able- bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. CSI star Robert David Hall commented, \\"I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable.\\" Glee creator Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and \\"it's hard to say no to someone that talented\\". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair, and that \\"I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he can still do what everyone else does.\\" Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: \\"'Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community.\\" Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: \\"Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound in real life?

The character is portrayed by actress Jenna Ushkowitz, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Tina was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Initially, she is a shy and insecure performer with a fake stutter, and member of the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. As the series progressed, she became more independent and confident. Storylines Tina auditions for the glee club with the song \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" by Katy Perry. Throughout the episode it is made clear that she speaks with a stutter. Her first solo performance as part of the club is \\"Tonight\\" from West Side Story. Fellow club member Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) had wanted the solo for herself, and quits New Directions in protest. Tina feels bad that she caused Rachel to quit, but Mr. Schuester continues to support her. Tina goes on a date with Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), and confesses to him that she has been faking her speech impediment since the sixth grade. She explains that as a painfully shy girl, she had wanted to drive others away. However she also says, that since she has joined the glee club, she no longer wants to do that. Artie, a paraplegic, is hurt that she lied to him, as he had thought that they had a connection. After a few months, Artie forgives Tina but makes sexist comments about her appearance, suggesting that she should begin wearing more revealing clothes if she wants to be with him. Tina shouts at him, prompting Artie to apologize and the two reunite. In the episode \\"Dream On\\", Tina tries to help Artie achieve his dream, which is to dance; but it proves to be an impractical endeavor. During a vampire craze at McKinley in the \\"Theatricality\\" episode, Principal Figgins bans Tina's gothic wardrobe. After dressing like Lady Gaga, she learns to be theatrical and scares Figgins into letting her wear her regular clothing by dressing as a vampire, which Figgins seems to believe is real. The season two premiere, \\"Audition\\", exposes that over the summer, Tina began dating Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.). She cites Artie's poor and occasionally chauvinistic treatment of her as her boyfriend; she and Mike had grown closer as camp counselors together at \\"Asian Camp\\". She and Mike had the longest-lasting continuous relationship on the show, and she reveals in the third season episode \\"The First Time\\" that she and Mike had first slept together over the summer‚Äîshe describes it as magical. Tina helps Mike with his singing; with her tutelage, he's able to get the part of Riff in McKinley's West Side Story. After Rachel gets suspended from school in time for Sectionals, Tina leads \\"ABC\\" alongside Mike on second lead; New Directions wins. In \\"Props\\", when New Directions starts planning a set list for the impending Nationals competition, Tina becomes frustrated because Rachel is again singing lead while she remains stuck in the background. Tina walks out. When Rachel tries to bribe her to withdraw her objections, she tells Rachel that she wants to experience a standing ovation of her own. Tina later falls into a fountain and strikes her head, which causes her to experience a vision in which all of the glee club members have switched roles‚Äîmost notably, she sees herself as Rachel and Rachel as her. \\"Rachel\\" performs \\"Because You Loved Me\\", and the club gives her a standing ovation. She thanks \\"Tina\\" for her support, and \\"Tina\\" in turn gives \\"Rachel\\" advice on how to salvage her failed NYADA audition. After Tina comes back to reality, she conveys that advice to Rachel. In the fourth season premiere, \\"The New Rachel\\", Tina develops a new sassy personality while it's revealed that she broke up with Mike during the summer after his graduation. She wants to become the lead singer of New Directions, as Rachel had promised her, and competes with Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Blaine (Darren Criss), and Unique (Alex Newell), but Blaine is picked instead. She later refuses to try out for the school musical, Grease, when Mike returns to help cast and choreograph it, not wanting to spend time with him, but ultimately accepts the role of Jan. Tina develops an infatuation on her gay, fellow New Directions' member, Blaine. Oblivious to her affections, Tina struggles with her unrequited love, but after a while Tina gets over her crush on Blaine and joins him to buy an engagement ring for Kurt. Tina and Blaine remain best friends. In season five, Tina is nominated for prom queen in \\"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and works to win the title, hiring Dottie Katzatori (Pamela Chan) as an assistant and dumping Sam as her prom date in order to win the single girl vote. Tina wins prom queen, but she is emotionally wrecked when a new cheerleader, Bree (Erinn Westbrook), dumps a bucket of slushies on her, in similar fashion to the movie Carrie. Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) gives Tina her dress and Tina goes back to stage in glory with the glee club's encouragement. In \\"Trio\\", she is caught by Blaine when she and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) make out in a classroom after the school is closed. She spends her last days of high school doing activities with fellow glee club seniors Blaine, Artie, and Sam Evans. She graduates with them in the middle of season five and goes to study at Brown University. Later, she visits New York to attend Rachel's opening night in Funny Girl on Broadway. In the final season, Tina and the other glee club alumni returns to help Rachel recruit new members for the newly rebooted glee club. She and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) helps Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. She, Quinn, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does. They all get a big lesson when they confront him and realize that a person with Down syndrome should be treated like everyone else. In \\"A Wedding\\", Tina tries to propose to Mike, and is rejected. It is revealed that Tina joins the glee club because she and Artie were playing truth or dare with their goth friends in the Pilot's parallel episode \\"2009\\". In the series finale, she starred in Artie's film that got into Slamdance Film Festival and now officially a couple with Artie. She attends the rededication to the McKinley's auditorium to the late Finn Hudson. She performs one last time with almost every members of New Directions from all seasons and take a bow with the rest of the Glee Cast. Development Ushkowitz (pictured) was found by series creator Ryan Murphy on Broadway, rather than through a traditional casting call. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Ushkowitz, who had previously starred in the Broadway revival of The King and I. The Glee casting associate in New York had previously cast Ushkowitz in Spring Awakening. Ushkowitz was initially given little information about Tina's backstory, and believed that her stutter was real. She was pleased when the truth was revealed, however, explaining: \\"It would have been fun to keep it because that just gives her one more quirk, but this opens up a whole new set of doors for Tina.\\" Ushkowitz has created her own backstory for Tina, and believes that she is rebelling against her mother rather than genuinely being a Goth, explaining: \\"I don't think her room is filled with dark posters and heavy metal stuff‚ÄîI just think this is a phase she's going through. There's definitely a lot of options for all the characters to evolve and change next year. I'm totally rooting for Tina to join The Cheerios or something crazy like that.\\" Ushkowitz is close to her co‚Äìstar Kevin McHale, and the two of them are in support of the relationship between their characters, referred to by the portmanteau \\"Artina\\", for Artie and Tina. McHale described Artie and Tina's relationship as being similar to the one between Cory (Ben Savage) and Topanga (Danielle Fishel) in the ABC comedy‚Äìdrama Boy Meets World, and believes they will always be together. The two characters did break up between seasons one and two, and they did not reconcile throughout season three. Although a number of the student cast members were seniors in the third season and graduated when it ended it was stated at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con that Tina will be a junior, and hence not graduating with them. Before the third season's debut in September 2011, Murphy said that Tina's role would increase in that season. Musical performances Glees cover of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\", featuring Ushkowitz as Tina on lead vocals, was released as a single, available for digital download, and was included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Zap2it writer Liz Pardue was pleased with the solo, and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal hailed the track as showcasing Ushkowitz's \\"strong crystalline voice\\". Gerrick D. Kennedy, writing for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that the \\"poignant\\" rendition was one of his \\"feel- good, tearjerker moments\\". The version charted at number 47 on the Australian Singles Chart, 38 on the Canadian Hot 100, 15 on the Irish Singles Chart, 35 on the UK Singles Chart, and 66 on the United States' Billboard Hot 100. Tina and Mike share a duet of \\"Sing!\\" in the second season episode \\"Duets\\", which was Aly Semigran of MTV and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News favorite routine of the episode, though Benigno gave it a \\"B\\" grade, as its appeal hinged on Mike's dancing. Vanity Fair Brett Berk gave it four stars out of five, his highest rating of the episode. Though Flandez and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also commented positively on the song, the former thought that Tina's sung interjections became annoying and the latter called it \\"far from the best of the evening\\". \\"Sing!\\" debuted at number 87 on the Hot 100, and also made number 67 on the Canadian Hot 100. Ushkowitz, alt=The grayscale picture of three people, two women and a man, who dance and put their hands on their hips. The man wears a dark outfit, compound of a vest, a shirt and pants. The women wear similar leotards. \\"Special Education\\"'s concluding number, a cover version of \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" with lead vocals by Ushkowitz and Amber Riley, was favored as its musical highlight. Hankinson said that the performance conveys \\"the exact brand of high-energy jubilation that I love the most,\\" and Jen Harper of BuddyTV was similarly impressed. Semigran characterized the decision to have Ushkowitz and Riley perform lead vocals as \\"unconventional (but oddly fitting)\\" and named the cover \\"a winner\\", while The A.V. Club contributor Emily VanDerWerff wrote that show \\"hits the song out of the park.\\" Benigno gave the song a \\"B+\\", and Entertainment Weeklys Tim Stack gave it an \\"A\\", and said series creator Ryan Murphy \\"chose the perfect gals to pull off this cover.\\" The rendition debuted at number 22 on both the Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100, and pushed the original version of the song by Florence and the Machine ahead of it to number 21 on the Hot 100, up from number 58 in the previous week. The series' version of \\"ABC\\" by The Jackson 5 in the third season \\"Hold On to Sixteen\\" episode, featuring Ushkowitz as one of the leads, was singled out for demonstrating \\"what a lovely singer Tina is\\" by Billboard Rae Votta, and BuddyTV editor John Kubicek said he enjoyed it \\"mostly because Tina deserves more singing time\\". It entered the Hot 100 at number 88, and the Canadian Hot 100 at 93. Tina sings L-O-V-E with Mike in the \\"Heart\\" episode, which The Washington Post Jen Chaney characterized as \\"cute and buoyant\\" and gave an \\"A‚àí\\", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called \\"absolute perfection\\". Michael Slezak of TVLine praised their \\"sweet vocals\\" and gave the performance a \\"B\\". C√©line Dion's \\"Because You Loved Me\\", featured in the \\"Props\\" episode, performed by Tina as Rachel received positive reviews. Both Chaney, who gave the song an and Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker, who graded it a \\"B+\\", stated their belief that the real Rachel would have done it better, and MTV's Jyll Saskin was more blunt: \\"We love you, Tina, but you just can't belt like Rachel\\". Rolling Stone journalist Erica Futterman was the most pleased, and wrote: \\"The richness of her voice removes some of the Lite FM softness embedded in the tune, and it really is great to see Tina get a song that suits her vocal abilities\\". Futterman said of Michele and Ushkowitz's \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\": \\"there was a glimmer of old-school Glee in the performance, carefree underdog status that made me smile\\". Saskin and Chaney both found the performance lacking; the former wrote that \\"something about this version falls flat\\", and Chaney gave it a and said it \\"wasn't as soaring as it could have been\\", though \\"Rachel and Tina's bonding moment was sweet\\". Slezak and Strecker both gave the performance an . Reception By the season one \\"Dream On\\" episode, Entertainment Weekly writer Tim Stack considered Tina \\"still such a mystery to me,\\" having not \\"much of an emotional connection to her\\", and expressed hope that the character's role would increase in the following season. Following the broadcast of \\"Theatricality\\", \\"Asian Vampires\\" became the fifth most discussed topic on the social networking website Twitter, in reference to Tina's storyline. Although he was \\"pleasantly surprised\\" by the \\"Theatricality\\" episode, James Poniewozik of Time found the Tina subplot in it \\"ridiculous and dispensable.\\" Writing for The Stir, Brittany Drye asked \\"Is Glee racist?\\", and cited several moments in the episode \\"Audition\\" which could be perceived as racist. She highlighted the pairing of Tina and Mike (noting their shared surname, \\"Chang\\") and the joke of Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) assuming they are a couple because they are both Asian. However, Drye speculated that in attempting \\"self-aware racism\\" the show was intentionally trying to point out the inanity of racist beliefs, and concluded that Glees self-awareness in this matter was its saving grace. The \\"A Night of Neglect\\" episode was criticized for, once again, cutting down a solo by Tina. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly commented, \\"Will Tina ever get to finish a song? Well, judging by the 20 seconds we saw, she certainly deserves to.\\" Futterman called the short performance \\"mostly spot-on\\", and Slezak pointed out: \\"Why is it that every time Tina sings‚Äîremember her sobbing \\"My Funny Valentine\\"‚Äîthings end weirdly? I wish we'd gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club's underappreciated talents.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Emily Exton suggested, \\"Maybe she'll get a chance to do a non-comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5?\\" Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"C\\" and wrote, > \\"It's nice to see Amber Riley, Harry Shum Jr. and Jenna Ushkowitz get a > chance to perform, but making a spectacle out of it does nothing but point > out the show's mistreatment of these characters outside of such special > showcases. For example, the show doesn't address the fact that the three > cast members selected for solos on \\"The Night of Neglect\\" were all visible > minorities, and what that 'neglect' might mean to the series' racial > diversity; addressing this would require subtlety the show can't muster, > three-dimensionality these characters lack, and consistency that seems > futile at this stage in the series development\\". Reviewing the third season debut episode, The Dallas Morning News Samantha Urban noted that Murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase Tina's roles. By the season three \\"Asian F\\" episode, Bell said that Mike and Tina's relationship was \\"really solidified\\", though she also pointed out that Tina was \\"the most neglected member of the entire cast\\". \\"Props\\", an episode that centered on the Tina's neglect, was said to \\"winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors\\" by Slezak. Votta said, \\"It felt organically Glee, zany but with heart.\\" E! Online's Jenna Mullins thought its body-swap sequence \\"breathed fresh 'n' crazy air into Glee\\", and Kubicek called it \\"the best thing Glee has ever done and will ever do\\". Saskin said it was \\"super trippy, makes no sense plot-wise\\" and was a \\"totally awesome Glee moment\\". VanDerWerff, however, described it as a \\"totally odd curiosity that comes out of nowhere\\", and said that the car trip taken by Tina and Rachel later in the episode was more successful at showing Tina \\"what Rachel's life is like\\". Kubicek called the offer of the trip and subsequent drive a \\"sweet bonding moment\\" between the pair, and called it \\"great\\" that \\"Tina is the one who saves the day\\" at the meeting with Carmen.

The character is portrayed by actress Dianna Agron, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. She is the cheerleading captain at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, as well as a member of the school's glee club. In the first episode, Quinn is introduced as an antagonistic queen bee stock character. She joins the school glee club to keep an eye on her boyfriend Finn (Cory Monteith) and becomes a spy for cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch); she remains part of the club after she is removed from the cheerleading team, the \\"Cheerios\\", due to her pregnancy. Over the course of the first season, her character matures and builds friendships with the other outcasts who make up the glee club. Quinn gives birth to a baby girl, Beth, whom she gives up for adoption. Quinn is also 16 years old when she had her baby. In the second season, she forms a bond with newcomer Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and later romances her first boyfriend Finn, reigniting her animosity with club co- captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and attempts to prove that Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) ‚Äî the adoptive mother of Beth ‚Äî is an unfit parent; eventually, she realizes that Beth is better off with Shelby. Quinn subsequently receives a college acceptance letter from Yale, and while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers a spinal injury that requires her to use a wheelchair for many weeks. She is eventually able to walk again. Quinn was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. The last character to be cast, initial responses to her were positive, though they soured during season one as the pregnancy storyline continued. Songs performed by Agron as Quinn have been released as singles, available for download, and also feature on the show's soundtrack albums. The role saw Agron nominated for the Teen Choice Award for \\"Breakout Female Star\\" in 2009, and a Screen Actors Guild award that same year. She was initially described by Agron as Rachel's enemy, and \\"terrible, the meanest girl\\". Storylines Season 1 Quinn is introduced as the leader of the cheerleading (The cheerios) squad at William McKinley High School,coached by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). She comes from a conservative Christian family, and is president of the celibacy club. When her boyfriend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) joins the glee club, New Directions, Quinn worries about his interaction with the group's star, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and joins New Directions herself along with her fellow Cheerios Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris). Sue then enlists the three of them to help her destroy the glee club from the inside. Upon discovering that she is pregnant, Quinn convinces Finn that he is the father, despite the fact that they never actually had sex. Quinn claims that Finn had prematurely ejaculated into her while they were making out in a hot tub. The real father is Finn's best friend Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling); he offers to support Quinn and the baby, but she rejects him, saying he is too irresponsible to care for a child. Quinn decides to put the baby up for adoption, and agrees to give it to Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents kick her out of their house, and she moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider giving up the baby, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother. Season 2 At the beginning of the new school year, Quinn is reinstated as head cheerleader. She begins dating new glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and later accepts a promise ring from him. When Sue forces Quinn, Santana and Brittany to choose between cheerleading and the glee club, all three initially go with the Cheerios to retain their popularity, but are later convinced by Finn to defect to New Directions. Quinn cheats on Sam with Finn, and Sam dumps Quinn after she lies to him about her time with Finn. She and Finn reunite, and Quinn starts campaigning for junior prom king and queen elections. Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), Puck's new girlfriend and one of Quinn's rivals for prom queen, discovers that before transferring to McKinley High, Quinn was known by her first name, Lucy. She was overweight and unpopular, and after slimming down and having rhinoplasty, reinvented herself as Quinn, using her middle name. At prom, Finn is thrown out for fighting with Rachel's date Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). Quinn is not named prom queen, and blames Rachel for her loss. She slaps her, but immediately regrets it and apologizes. Finn later breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel. Season 3 At the start of her senior year, Quinn has completely reinvented herself and refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions, although when New Directions performs \\"You Can't Stop The Beat\\" in the auditorium Quinn can be seen watching them with a conflicted look on her face. Shelby lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club, but Quinn reveals to Puck she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody. After Puck tells Shelby of Quinn's true intentions, Shelby informs Quinn that she does not want her in Beth's life. Quinn later reveals a desire to have a second baby with Puck. Puck refuses, and tries to comfort her; he offers to share an important secret if she promises not to tell anyone, which ultimately results in Quinn planning to get Shelby fired for sleeping with a student, Puck. Quinn decides not to reveal Shelby's secret for Beth's sake. Quinn advises Rachel to refuse Finn's marriage proposal and leave her past behind. Quinn has done so, and she has been accepted at Yale. Quinn asks to allow her to rejoin the Cheerios, but Sue refuses. However, following Regionals, she changes her mind. Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and supports it. Rachel is reluctant to start the subsequent wedding without Quinn, and texts Quinn. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car. Quinn's car accident has left her in a wheelchair, suffering from a severely compressed spine. By \\"Prom-asaurus\\" she is able to stand and to walk a few steps in the sessions. When Quinn is nominated for prom queen, Finn agrees to campaign with her, but is outraged when he discovers that she has been hiding the fact that she can now stand for the sympathy vote. When Quinn and Santana count the votes, they discover that Finn has won and so has Quinn. Quinn realizes that the victory means nothing. She and Santana falsely report the prom queen results as a write-in victory for Rachel. Her recovery is rapid enough to allow her to dance in the \\"Nationals\\" competition episode, which New Directions wins. Quinn helps Puck study for the test he needs to pass in order to graduate. She tells him that with all they went through, they are bonded for life, and she kisses him. Emboldened, Puck passes his test. Later, Quinn returns her cheerleading uniform to Sue, and the two have a tearful farewell. Season 4 Quinn returns to Lima for Thanksgiving in the eighth episode of the season, and helps to mentor the new members of New Directions as they prepare for Sectionals competition. Quinn is partnered with Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin). Kitty convinces Quinn, whom she idolizes, that Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), Puck's half brother, is pressuring Marley into having sex with him. Quinn becomes hostile towards Jake, Santana confronts Quinn about having discovered that Kitty has given Marley laxatives in order to further Marley's bulimia. Quinn, who is dating one of her teachers at Yale, accuses Santana of being jealous of her and projecting her hostility in their surrogates, leading to a fight before Quinn storms out of the choir room. Quinn travels to New York to give Rachel helpful advice over whether or not to do a nude scene in a short film in \\"Naked\\". Quinn returns to Lima for Will and Emma's wedding in \\"I Do\\", and evidently single again, vents her frustrations about men. She and Santana get drunk at the wedding reception and sleep together, which they agree was a fun one-time, and then two time, experimentation for Quinn. Season 5 Quinn returns to Lima with a new boyfriend, Biff, for the special 100th episode. Puck is jealous of their relationship, because he still loves her. Quinn is lying to him because she does not want him to know about her past yet. Puck convinces her to tell Biff the truth, which she does. Biff insults her, which causes a fight between Puck and Biff. They later break-up. Puck and Quinn talk about Finn and their relationship, and she realizes that she still loves him. They later start a relationship again, which is later confirmed in the next episode. Season 6 Quinn along with the New Directions alumni return in the episode \\"Homecoming\\" to help Rachel and Kurt rebuild the New Directions. Quinn, Santana, and Brittany attempt to recruit new members by performing in Cheerios Alumni outfits, but only recruit twins Mason and Madison when former Glee new member, Kitty, who was the only member not to be transferred as Sue saw her as a star player, announced she wouldn't return because of the way Artie treated her and everyone else when he left. Puck is still her boyfriend. She appears in \\"Jagged Little Tapestry\\" along with Tina to help Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. Quinn, Tina, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does. They all get a big lesson when they confront him and realize that a person with Down syndrome should be treated like everyone else. Despite being Santana and Brittany's best friend, she is notably absent during their wedding in \\"A Wedding\\". She is mentioned several times during the Pilot's parallel episode \\"2009\\", as Finn's cheerleader girlfriend. She is later seen during Don't Stop Believin' watching the performance with Sue and Santana. She returns in the last minutes of the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\" performing backing vocals for \\"I Lived\\" with the rest of the Glee Cast for the re-dedication of the Auditorium. Development Casting and creation Dianna Agron (pictured) plays Quinn. Quinn is portrayed by actress Dianna Agron. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway looking for unknown actors. Agron was the last primary actor to be cast, having won the role only days before the pilot began filming. Agron auditioned for Glee coming from a background in dancing and acting. She has been taking dance classes since the age of three, appeared in many music theatre productions and has appeared in television roles for Skidmarks, CSI: NY, and Heroes. Agron said in a 2009 interview pertaining to her casting session: \\"I nearly bailed on my audition for the show. I was so nervous\\". With her wholesome good looks, Agron certainly looked the part, but the producers wondered if she appeared too innocent. Agron said in an interview: \\"They told me to come back with straight hair and to dress sexier. Later that week, I started work.\\" Agron auditioned with Frank Sinatra's \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\". The Glee producers said \\"we really lucked out in finding Agron to play Quinn\\". In December 2010, Ryan Murphy announced that the cast of Glee would be replaced at the end of the third season to coincide with their graduation. Murphy said: \\"Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot.\\" He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: \\"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\\" Although four graduating seniors were confirmed in January 2012 as returning in the fourth season‚ÄîRachel, Finn, Kurt and Santana‚Äîthere had been no announcement regarding Quinn or any other seniors as of the end of February 2012. As of May 2012, Murphy stated that all graduating seniors will come back for season 4 but, not all will be doing \\"all 22 episodes\\". Characterization Quinn is described by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and \\"terrible, the meanest girl\\". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that \\"she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost.\\" Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being \\"lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee.\\" Agron commented: \\"Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [those stereotypes] didn't exist a little bit. But [co-creator] Ryan Murphy has a way of taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing.\\" Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron said in an interview with HitFix: \\"I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things.\\" She added: \\"I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short- changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school.\\" Quinn's role as head cheerleader is central to understanding her character. Agron said that she had never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. \\"If I had been [a cheerleader], I would've ended up on crutches,\\" she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, \\"I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience.\\" Reception Critical response Quinn (Agron, pictured) has received positive reviews from critics. Quinn has received positive reviews from critics. The role saw Agron nominated for the Teen Choice Award for \\"Female Breakout Star\\" in 2009. She and the other cast members were awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 2010, and nominated in the same category the following year. The character's accidental pregnancy storyline received mixed reviews from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly deemed it \\"a good dramatic twist\\", but hoped that it would not be a long-lasting storyline. Reviews of her storyline became increasingly negative, though Agron was praised for her dramatic acting during the confrontation scene with Quinn's parents in \\"Ballad\\". Gerrick D. Kennedy, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was critical of the ongoing pregnancy plot in the episode \\"Hairography\\", and noted that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, and wrote: \\"I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing \\"Papa Don't Preach\\". Reviewing the episode \\"Journey to Regionals\\", Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich called Quinn's birthing scenes‚Äîinterspersed with Vocal Adrenaline performing Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"‚Äîboth \\"brilliant\\" and \\"terrible\\". He wrote, \\"If nothing else, it was definitely the most visually arresting way to represent the birthing process I've ever seen outside of The Miracle of Life. But I kind of liked it. Somewhere, Freddie Mercury is nodding proudly, and saying, 'World, I forgive you for We Will Rock You.'\\" Brett Berk, writing for Vanity Fair, was positive about the scripting of the Quinn character in the second season premiere, now that the pregnancy storyline was over, and was happy to see the return of \\"evil Quinn\\". Joel Kelly of TV Squad criticized the decision to pair Quinn with Finn again in the Valentine's Day oriented episode. He saw it as a regression of the characters, and commented: \\"Yes, it feels like Glee Classic, because the series started with the two of them together. But both of them have changed‚ÄîQuinn more so than Finn‚Äîand having them dating again seems like they're going back to the days when Quinn was the icy lead Cheerio and Finn was the nice but dumb star quarterback.\\" Quinn's season three reinvention attracted mixed reviews. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter listed her change as a highlight of the episode, and hoped to see more of her new attitude. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it \\"the most interesting thing Quinn has done since giving birth to a baby to the soundtrack of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\\", but VanDerWerff suggested the development hinged on the fact the producers no longer knew how to utilize Agron. She was ranked No. 13 in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Musical performances Several songs performed by Agron as Quinn have been released as singles, available for digital download, also featured on the show's soundtrack albums. Agron made her musical debut at the end of the episode \\"Showmance\\" where she performed Dionne Warwick's \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\". Quinn's next solo was in the episode \\"Throwdown\\", where she performed The Supremes' \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\". The song was released on Glee: The Music, Volume 1. Flandez deemed the cover of \\"Keep Holding On\\", the ensemble performance on the episode, an \\"emotionally satisfying showstopper\\", however was critical of Quinn's cover of \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\", which he called \\"thin and jarring\\". Aly Semigran of MTV observed that Quinn spontaneously bursting into song brought Glee \\"dangerously close to High School Musical territory\\". Agron later performed a solo in the episode \\"Hairography\\" singing Madonna's \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" after her father learns she is pregnant. This performance by Agron was released as a single. She performed a rendition of James Brown's \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" in the episode \\"Funk\\". CNN's Lisa Respers France was \\"slightly disturbed\\" by Quinn's \\"weird\\" performance of \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" using pregnant teenagers as backing dancers. Quinn (right) was romantically linked with Sam Evans (left) early in the second season; they sang two duets together. In season two, Quinn performs \\"Lucky\\" with Sam Evans in the episode \\"Duets\\", which was named by some critics as \\"the most impressive number of the evening\\"; others called it \\"absolutely fantastic\\" with particular praise for Agron, who was said to be often overlooked. \\"Lucky\\" debuted at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100;Peak chart positions for season two singles in the United States: * \\"Lucky\\": * \\"I Feel Pretty / Unpretty\\": it was at number seventeen on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. Quinn's duet performance with Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) of the mash-up \\"I Feel Pretty / Unpretty\\" was the highest charted single featured in the episode \\"Born This Way\\", debuting at number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at number thirteen on the Digital 100 charts and sold 112,000 digital downloads in the United States in its first week of release. It was the highest charting Glee single on the Billboard charts since \\"Loser like Me\\", which debuted at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 210,000 downloads in its first week. In season three, Quinn sings her first solo number since the first season, \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" by The Jackson 5, which received mostly positive reviews. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post gave the song a and said it \\"worked much better than every track that preceded it\\" because it adapted the song to the show \\"instead of trying to out-Jackson Jackson\\". Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch called it \\"a nice summation of her character's journey, but not vocally impressive enough to justify listening to outside of the episode\\" and gave it a \\"B\\". Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV described it as a \\"blah performance\\", but Kate Stanhope of TV Guide said it was \\"sweet and reflective\\". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that it was \\"a tune well-suited for Quinn's sultry voice and the flipped meaning she gives the lyrics\\", and TVLine Michael Slezak had a similar take: he gave it an \\"A\\" and called it a \\"remarkably lovely fit\\" for her voice.

The character was portrayed by the late Naya Rivera, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Santana was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Introduced as a minor antagonist and a sidekick to Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) in the first episode of Glee, Santana's role grew over the course of the show's first season. In the second season, Rivera was promoted to a series regular, and Santana was given more high-profile storylines, such as the development of her romantic feelings for her best friend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), and the subsequent realization that she is a lesbian. Rivera, who has been vocally supportive of the love story between her and Morris' character, has received widespread praise for her portrayal of Santana, as well as for her for vocal work in numerous songs performed as part of the show's central glee club, New Directions. Santana is introduced alongside Quinn and Brittany as one of the three most popular cheerleaders at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. She joins the school's glee club, and soon is spying on it for Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the cheerleading team the Cheerios. As the season progresses, she becomes more sympathetic to other glee club members, saying she is staying in the club not because Sue is forcing her, but because she likes it. She has several romantic relationships, briefly dating Puck (Mark Salling), taking Finn Hudson's (Cory Monteith) virginity, and carrying on a friends with benefits relationship with Brittany. In season two, the show delves into the motivations behind Santana's antagonism and her sexual aggressiveness towards boys; it is later revealed that her cruel attitude is because she is struggling with her romantic feelings towards Brittany, and subsequently with her lesbian identity. This storyline has been positively received by critics. Storylines Santana is introduced as a popular cheerleader at William McKinley High School. Santana and her friends, cheerleaders Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), join the school glee club, New Directions, because Quinn wants to keep an eye on her boyfriend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith); cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) then enlists the three of them to help her destroy the glee club from the inside. Initially romantically linked to football player Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling), Santana soon breaks up with him over his bad credit score, though the two have an on-again, off-again relationship well into the show's second season. Brittany also reveals in an offhand comment that she and Santana have slept together. When the two are accused of giving Sue the New Directions set list for their first show choir competition, Santana defends herself and admits that she has come to enjoy participating in the club. After Quinn is kicked off the cheerleading squad due to her pregnancy, Santana takes over as head cheerleader. At Sue's behest, Santana and Brittany go on a date with Finn, who is now the glee club co-captain. Santana takes his virginity, though Finn immediately regrets sleeping with her. When Puck briefly dates Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Santana is jealous and confronts her with an aggressive duet of \\"The Boy Is Mine\\". A similar confrontation, though entirely physical, occurs in the second season after Puck sings a love song to Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) in front of the glee club, though Santana loses badly to Lauren. In season two, Santana is demoted from her position as head cheerleader when Quinn reveals that she had breast implants over the summer, leading to a physical fight between the two. While making out, Brittany suggests to Santana that the two of them should sing Melissa Etheridge's \\"Come To My Window\\" for a glee club duet competition. Alarmed, Santana claims that she was only sleeping with Brittany because Puck was temporarily unavailable. Brittany begins to date club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), which piques Santana's jealousy. She briefly quits the glee club with Brittany and Quinn when Sue demands that they choose between being in glee club and being cheerleaders, but Finn convinces them to reverse their decision, and they quit the Cheerios instead. Temporarily without a boyfriend after Puck begins dating Lauren, she breaks up Quinn and her boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and dates him herself for several weeks. Confronted by Brittany about her feelings for her, Santana confesses that she is in love with her but fears being ostracized by the student body for being in a same-sex relationship, due to what had happened to Kurt (Chris Colfer), who is openly gay, so many times that year. Brittany says she reciprocates her love, but as she also loves Artie, she will not break up with him. In the hope of convincing Brittany to drop Artie and be with her, Santana runs for school prom queen. She blackmails closeted jock and Kurt's bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) into becoming her beard and running mate, and to also start an anti-bullying campaign with her to get Kurt to transfer back, as he only left McKinley to go to Dalton Academy for a safe school environment because Karofsky had threatened to kill him. He wins prom king, but Santana is not named queen; instead, it is Kurt. Brittany comforts her, and encourages her to embrace her true identity. In season three, Santana and Brittany rejoin the Cheerios, and Sue appoints Santana co- captain along with Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). Santana is briefly banished from New Directions for disloyalty, and though she is soon allowed to return, she leaves again to join Mercedes in a newly formed all-girl glee club, the Troubletones, and convinces Brittany, who is now her girlfriend, to come with her. In \\"Mash Off\\", Santana pushes the growing rivalry between the clubs to a new level by bullying Finn and Rory. When her supposed apology to Finn becomes another stream of insults, he accuses her of being a coward for tearing other people down because she can't admit that she's in love with Brittany, thus outing her in a crowded public hallway. They are overheard, and Santana's now- revealed lesbianism is used in an \\"attack\\" ad against Sue by one of her opponents in the congressional election campaign. Though Santana is warned before the ad runs, she is nevertheless devastated by being publicly outed: she hadn't yet come out to her family. She does so, and while her parents accept her declaration, her grandmother is offended that Santana has made her sexuality public and disowns her, leaving Santana heartbroken. After slapping Finn for outing her, she was made to apologize while Finn received no repercussions for the outing which caused the slap. The Troubletones are defeated by New Directions at Sectionals, and Quinn convinces Santana, Brittany and Mercedes to return to the New Directions, having arranged for them to be guaranteed one Troubletones number in all future competitions. When Principal Figgins tells Santana and Brittany in \\"Heart\\" to stop kissing publicly at school because he's received complaints, despite not enforcing the same ban on heterosexual couples, Santana is angry, and uses the God Squad's singing-valentine fundraiser to make a point by hiring them to deliver a lovesong valentine to Brittany. New Directions competes at Regionals, and with the aid of the Troubletones number featuring Santana, Brittany and Mercedes, the club wins. Later season plots including the leaking of Brittany and Santana's sex tape and Santana's anxiety about her future. In the season finale, after the New Directions win Nationals in Chicago, Santana's mother (Gloria Estefan) writes her a check so she can pursue her dreams in New York if she really wants to. In season four, Santana is attending the University of Louisville in Kentucky on a cheerleading scholarship. She and Brittany make attempts at a long-distance relationship, although they break up when they agree it won't work in \\"The Break Up\\". Santana comes by McKinley to help out with the school musical in \\"Glease\\" and again for Thanksgiving and to help New Directions prepare for the upcoming Sectionals competition in \\"Thanksgiving\\". As a mentor, she works with Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist). Santana suspects something is wrong with her, and later finds laxatives in Marley's backpack. She confronts Quinn that she suspects cheerleader, glee clubber and Quinn's apprentice, Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), is trying to deliberately hurt Marley. She is present for the Sectionals performance, and her suspicions appear to be confirmed when Marley collapses on stage due to starvation and anxiety. She visits Ohio for Christmas in \\"Glee, Actually\\" and visits Kurt and Rachel in New York in the episode \\"Naked\\". After a jealous unsuccessful attempt to break up her exes Sam and Brittany in \\"Diva\\", Santana realizes she belongs in New York with Rachel and Kurt and moves in with them. In \\"I Do\\" she and Quinn sleep together at Will and Emma's wedding, which they agree was a fun one-time experimentation for Quinn. Later, Kurt and Rachel are shown attempting to adjust to Santana, who is making herself at home in the loft a little too quickly for their comfort. In \\"Girls (and Boys) On Film\\", Santana later confronts Rachel about a used pregnancy test she found in the garbage, causing Rachel to break down in Santana's arms. In \\"Feud\\", Santana takes Rachel to the doctor, where they discover her pregnancy was a false alarm. However, Santana also learns that Rachel's boyfriend, Brody Weston, is a gigolo. She confronts Brody over this and eventually informs Finn, who tries to scare Brody into leaving town. Later she tells Rachel the truth herself, for which Rachel is ultimately grateful, in \\"Guilty Pleasures\\". In season five, Santana is employed at a diner in New York. Rachel and Kurt subsequently join her as employees. Santana meets Dani (Demi Lovato), a fellow waitress at the diner who is also a lesbian. They begin a relationship in \\"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds\\". Santana also stars in a commercial for Yeast-I-Stat which she is proud of and shares with Rachel. Santana returns to Lima for Finn's funeral and memorial in \\"The Quarterback\\". She sings The Band Perry's \\"If I Die Young\\" but she breaks down midway through the song. She later confeses to Kurt that she had planned on being nice and telling everyone about the nice things Finn had done for her. Kurt then gives Santana Finn's letterman jacket. Santana joins Kurt's new band in the episode \\"A Katy or a Gaga\\" and suggests that they name the band the Apocalypsticks, which is shot down by Kurt. Brittany states her unhappiness at being a math genius and kisses her ex-girlfriend Santana. In \\"New Directions\\", Brittany agrees to dropping out of MIT before going on a trip to Lesbos with Santana. Santana asks Brittany to go with her to New York after their trip, Brittany accepts. Santana returned to New York in \\"Opening Night\\" to watch her friend, Rachel's Broadway debut in the revival of Funny Girl. In \\"The Back-Up Plan\\", Santana helps Mercedes to finish her album. In the studio, Santana suggests that they should get out of the studio and explore New York. While leaving the studio, Mercedes and Santana sang Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop (That Thing). However, Mercedes' producer rejected their duet because Santana isn't famous enough. Because of that, Mercedes asked Santana to sign a contract so that Santana could sing a duet with Mercedes in the latter's album. When Santana found out that Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles because of her audition for a television show, she suggests that she would play Fanny Brice for the night. The next day, Santana said that she would be a better friend. In \\"Old Dog New Tricks\\" she became Rachel's publicist. She sang Eddie Money's \\"Take Me Home Tonight\\" with Artie, Blaine, Kurt, Maggie, Mercedes, Rachel, and Sam. In \\"The Untitled Rachel Berry Project\\", Santana was not in New York because she was shooting a Yeast-I-Stat commercial. Brittany and Mercedes will meet her in Reno for Mercedes' mall tour. At the beginning of season six, Santana, Brittany and the rest of Glee Club alumni return to McKinley High School in \\"Homecoming\\". Along with Quinn and Brittany, she performs \\"Problem\\" by Ariana Grande in an attempt to recruit cheerleaders to join the revamped New Directions, currently being revived by Rachel. Their attempt got discouraged by Kitty, the current Cheerios captain and a former glee club member who is bitter with the alumni. Santana succeeds in persuading two twin cheerleaders to audition. She also performs \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"Home\\" with the alumni around the school. In \\"Jagged Little Tapestry\\", Santana and the alumni stick around for another week to help Rachel recruit for New Directions. After a sweet performance of \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" / \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" with Brittany, Santana proposes and Brittany accepts. However, Kurt disagrees with their decision, but Santana insults him by telling him that Blaine broke off his proposal because Kurt is weird. Santana and Brittany then return in \\"What the World Needs Now\\" to deal with Santana's disapproving grandmother Alma ‚Äì with whom she hasn't spoken since coming out as a lesbian. Brittany takes matters into her own hands and tries to invite Alma to the wedding, but Alma's prejudice is too strong and she rejects their engagement, and Brittany tells her off for doing so. Later the New Directions serenade them in an attempt to be invited to their upcoming wedding. She and Brittany are wed in a double ceremony with Kurt and Blaine, because Brittany wanted it that way, in the eighth episode \\"A Wedding\\". Before the ceremony, Sue arrives with Alma, who she has helped to realize that although she may not believe females should marry each other, family is the most important thing, leading her and Santana to reconcile. Santana and Brittany return briefly in the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\" for a last performance with the rest of the Glee Cast. Development Over the course of the series, Santana (Rivera, pictured) begins to struggle with her sexual identity. Before her casting on Glee, Naya Rivera had made numerous appearances in small roles on popular primetime television shows. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Rivera drew on her own high school experience of unpopularity to prepare for the role, as well as watching films such as Mean Girls to \\"really get in the zone and feel like a bitchy Sophomore\\". She has described Santana as \\"your typical high school cheerleader, for the most part,\\" explaining: \\"She's really mean and loves boys. She's really witty so I love playing her.\\" She has characterized Santana as \\"a bit of a bad girl\\" who is \\"really snarky and always has these really witty one-liners she throws out there.\\" Rivera enjoys the fact Santana is competitive and headstrong as she herself shares those traits, but dislikes Santana's mean streak. She auditioned for the role as she loves singing, dancing and acting, and had never before had the opportunity to combine all three skills in one project. She finds the show's pacing challenging, especially the dancing, and commented in June 2009 that her most memorable moment on Glee was performing the Cheerios' glee club audition piece, \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\". Santana played a more prominent part in the last nine episodes of Glee first season. Rivera commented: \\"Santana's been wreaking havoc with people's boyfriends and people's babies and teachers‚Äîshe's the high school terror, and she's going to continue to be the villain.\\" Although Santana continues to step over others to get what she wants, she exhibits moments of compassion and loyalty to the glee club. Rivera has been vocal in her support of the Santana/Brittany relationship, and her attitudes toward Santana's emotional attachment have informed her portrayal of the character. In April 2010, when asked if any of \\"the guys\\" were Santana's soul mate, Rivera answered, \\"I think that Brittany is her soul mate. I think that they should end up together. They're in love.\\" A month later, when interviewed by The Advocate, she reiterated this point, saying, \\"Maybe they‚Äôll fall in love. I do think they're soul mates. Brittany just gets Santana, even though a lot of people don‚Äôt like her.\\" On December 8, 2010, after a surge of fan disappointment over Twitter at the recent absence of Brittana, Rivera tweeted, \\"There‚Äôs been a Brittana fan uproar‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt worry, I miss it too.\\" In January 2011, after several more \\"Brittana fan uproars\\", in an article entitled \\"The future of Brittana: Outlook Not so good\\", Rivera expressed the reason for such strong fan response: \\"Honestly, on a deeper level, to the girls that are going through that and it's not so comical in their world, in their everyday lives, they kind of looked up to us, in a sense. That's kind of my reason for hoping they continue the storyline.\\" Ironically, soon after this pessimistic article, Brad Falchuk, co-creator of Glee, tweeted on January 20, \\"Brittana is on. Brittana was always on.\\" Santana's arc following \\"Sexy\\", where she admits her romantic feelings for Brittany, sees Santana come to terms with her sexual orientation. Falchuk describes Santana, from this point, as having come out internally to herself, but being afraid of coming out to her peers. \\"Santana is a lesbian. She might not be ready to come out yet, but she is.\\" By the middle of the third season, Santana is both out to her peers, and in a public romantic relationship with Brittany. Reception Critical response The relationship between Santana (Naya Rivera, left) and Brittany (Heather Morris, right) has been well received by critics and viewers. When a promotional clip for the episode \\"Sectionals\\" indicated that Brittany and Santana had slept together, Dorothy Snarker, writing for lesbian entertainment website AfterEllen.com, praised the pairing, referring to them by the portmanteau \\"Brittana\\". Snarker called the two her \\"new favorite Glee pairing\\", commenting that: \\"While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they‚Äôve made it count. [...] Never mind Finn and Rachel‚ÄîI'm on Team Brittana now.\\" She was ranked first in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Santana was included in TV Guide list of the best TV bitches. She was also listed in MTV's Best TV Characters of 2011. For her role in \\"Sexy\\", Santana has received critical acclaim. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was somewhat surprised by the storyline, observing that Santana had not previously been portrayed as \\"so serious and vulnerable\\", but enjoyed the depth it brought to her character. She and Time James Poniewozik both praised Rivera's acting, with Gonzalez calling her \\"heartbreakingly perfect\\". Poniewozik did not find Santana's revelation sudden; he was impressed that the episode found \\"pathos and heartbreak\\" in a coupling formerly treated humorously. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club deemed it the best storyline of the episode, saying it was almost alone the reason the episode received a \\"B\\". She called the scene where Santana confessed her feelings for Brittany one of the best moments of the season. Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was pleased that the storyline was \\"treated with a tender realness,\\" something generally lacking on network television, and Brown, though unconvinced that Santana's conflicted sexuality adequately explained her abrasive personality, praised the series for \\"exploring some of the more complicated aspects of adolescent sexuality\\", writing that \\"Glee does an admirable job of attempting to be all-inclusive.\\" VanDerWerff praised the character development of Santana, calling it the highlight of the episode \\"Born This Way\\". She continued, \\"The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera‚Äôs work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue. [...] On a show where we‚Äôre meant to accept that the characters do whatever the fuck the writers need them to from scene to scene, the storyline of Santana realizing she was in love with Brittany and [...] is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school.\\" The episode \\"Mash Off\\"'s concluding musical number, \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\", was acclaimed as its main highlight. Wall Street Journal writer Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as \\"electrifying\\" and \\"golden\\". Rolling Stone contributor Erica Futterman wrote that the performance was one of Glee best sequences: \\"Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks from one of the year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment.\\" Billboard editor Rae Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, \\"Journey to Regionals\\", and stated, \\"Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting.\\" Jen Chaney of The Washington Post awarded the sequence an \\"A+\\" grade: \\"Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, and the fact that it marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage\\" of the two Adele songs, \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\", was \\"all the more powerful\\". Brian Moyler of Gawker asserted that the number was \\"perfection\\" and said, \\"This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life.\\" Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show \\"hit it out of the park\\" and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak gave the number an \\"A+\\" and wrote, \\"Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts.\\" Accolades At the 2010 AfterEllen.com Visibility Awards, Brittany and Santana were nominated for the Favorite Fictional Lesbian Couple award, and Rivera was nominated in the Favorite TV Actress category. Also that year, Rivera was nominated in the Best Supporting Actress/Television category at the Imagen Awards, and she and her co-stars won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. They were nominated in the same category the following year. At the 2011 ALMA Awards, Rivera was nominated in the Favorite TV Actress ‚Äì Leading Role in a Comedy category. Impact The character of Santana had a positive impact on U.S. television, providing rare queer Latina and Afro-Latinx representation on prime time television and laying the foundation for similar characters and stories to follow. Summarizing her multi-faceted representation, Refinery29's Ariana Romero explained that \\"Santana isn't merely an unapologetic Latina ‚Äì itself a painful rarity on- screen, particularly [during Glee's run] ‚Äì but she is unapologetically Afro- Latina\\". Alicia Ram√≠rez for O, The Oprah Magazine wrote that Santana was \\"one of the most visible Latinx lesbians on primetime TV\\". The impact of the character spread through pop culture, with Jorge Rodriguez-Jimenez of Mit√∫ writing that \\"You didn't have to be an avid viewer of the show to understand and appreciate the magnitude of Santana Lopez\\". In the 2013 book Latinos and Narrative Media: Participation and Portrayal, edited by Frederick Luis Aldama, Rivera and Santana are discussed. In one chapter, by Isabel Molina-Guzm√°n, she is highlighted as the main example of a character that is non-stereotypical but still embodies Latinidad; is listed with Jessica Alba's turn in Dark Angel as a significant character who has main storylines not focused on race; and is noted as racially ambiguous enough, not firmly defined as white or black, to open the door for new Latina narratives. Molina-Guzm√°n added that Rivera played \\"the first lesbian Latina on primetime television [and thus was] honored for her compassionate and complex representation\\". In Tracy L. Hawkins' chapter in the 2014 book Queer in the Choir Room: Essays on Gender and Sexuality in Glee, she explains that until Glee, and particularly the complexity of Santana's seasons-long coming out journey, all stories of television characters revealing their sexuality followed certain norms that play into stereotypes and did not focus on the character themselves. Romero noted that while Santana starts the show as little more than \\"the feisty Latina trope\\", Rivera's performance gave her more nuance and the character ultimately confronted others for perpetuating harmful Latino stereotypes in the episode \\"The Spanish Teacher\\"; this episode notably included a duet between Rivera and the queer Latino Ricky Martin, something Romero describes as one of the show's more subtle nods to queer representation and \\"one of Santana's best moments of Latinx pride\\". Ram√≠rez also highlighted Santana's confidence in performing in musical theatre as positive representation, showing her \\"unapologetically taking up room in [a] predominantly white space\\". Elements of her queer representation were discussed. Digital Spy's Emily Browne wrote of the significance of showing Santana's emotional response to her sexuality but not being defined by it, with the character being \\"a popular, confident, smart femme\\". Study Breaks added that \\"Santana is a deeply flawed character\\", which creates a healthier representation of queer characters than most, who are \\"too often [...] nearly perfect individuals\\", and Ms. noted that though there was much more queer representation by 2020, Rivera's push for Santana's relationship to be handled well makes the character still stand out as \\"one of the few lesbian characters to ultimately have a happy ending\\". A BBC retrospective in 2020 looked at the impact of Rivera's role as Santana in providing important representation, internationally, for young queer women and the idea of being out in the music industry. Following the death of Rivera in July 2020, numerous outlets and individuals cited her portrayal of Santana as a positive representation of both Latinas and the LGBT community in the media. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a tribute, saying that \\"As a Latina, it's rare to have rich, complex characters reflect us in media. Naya worked hard to give that gift to so many\\", and California senator Kamala Harris wrote in a tweet that Rivera inspired \\"countless young LGBTQ+ people to unapologetically be themselves\\". Singer Demi Lovato, who played the girlfriend of Rivera's character on Glee in its fifth season, expressed similar sentiments, writing: \\"The character you played was groundbreaking for tons of closeted (at the time) queer girls like me and your ambition and accomplishments were inspiring to Latina women all over the world\\". The Gay Emmys replaced its Best Coming Out Story award with the Santana Lopez Legacy Award For Outstanding Queer Teen Character, beginning with the 2020 event.

The character was portrayed by Mark Salling, and appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009 to the series finale, broadcast on March 20, 2015. Puck was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. He is Finn's best friend and football teammate, who initially disapproves of Finn joining the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set, but he eventually joins it himself. In 2010, Salling was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star Male for his work as Puck, and in 2011 for the Choice TV: Scene Stealer Male category. Development Casting and creation Puck was played by Mark Salling. He was also portrayed as a preschooler by Matthew Lepper in the episode \\"The Substitute\\". Salling had sent 100 packets to agents and managers, and \\"one called me and submitted me for Glee that day in her office.\\" He had five auditions for Glee before being cast as Puck. Characterization Salling found it challenging to make the character \\"more than two-dimensional so he can be likable at the same time\\", which necessitated \\"find[ing] the balance between arrogance and cocky and sensible and likable\\". He recalled that \\"in the breakdown for the show, when they were describing his character in the very beginning, it's like Puck: a man-child.\\" Salling explained that Puck has \\"stars in his eyes, he's hoping to get out of this small town.\\" Salling gained before filming the pilot episode in order to better embody his football playing character. He then lost for a scene in the third episode that required him to be toned, which he described as \\"an extreme experience\\". Relationships Puck's main basis for relationships at the beginning is sexual rather than romantic. He has sexual encounters with his female pool- cleaning clients and fellow students, including a recurrent relationship with cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) that seems to be casual, though Santana confronts both Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) when Puck starts pursuing them in the first and second seasons respectively. He falls in love with Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after he takes her virginity and impregnates her despite the fact that she's dating his best friend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) at the time, but he can't give up flirting with and seducing others even when Quinn contemplates raising the baby-to-be with him as he wants rather than giving it up for adoption, since she refuses to have sex with him again. The brief pairing of Puck with Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) in the episode \\"Mash-Up\\", spurred by his mother urging him to find a Jewish girlfriend, dissolves because he wants Quinn and she wants Finn. Series creator Ryan Murphy was surprised by the positive fan response to their pairing, which he described as \\"strange and bizarre\\", explaining that he had believed fans would prefer Rachel to be with Finn. As a result of the response, Murphy planned to revisit their romance later in the season, though nothing much came of it. In the second season, Puck recruits Lauren to join the glee club when the club needs a twelfth member in order to participate in the Sectionals competition. Within a couple of months, he has fallen in love with her, but she doesn't succumb to his blandishments, and he's forced to woo her over a long period of time, starting as friends. He supports her in her first solo for glee club and runs her campaign for prom queen. They are still a couple at the end of the school year. In the fourth episode of the third season, Puck and the adoptive mother of his child Shelby Corcoran kiss. He ends the series dating Quinn. Storylines Season 1 Mark Salling (pictured) played Puck Puck is introduced as a football player and bully at William McKinley High School; he is frequently seen throwing fellow students into dumpsters, or tossing slushies in their faces. It is later revealed that he is Jewish. He is the best friend of Finn, the quarterback, and has a summer pool-cleaning business that leads to sexual encounters with his adult female clients. Despite that, he has sex with fellow students, including in an on- again, off-again relationship with Santana Lopez, a cheerleader, which does not completely end forever until the middle of the second season. Puck initially acts homophobic and mocks Finn for joining the school glee club, New Directions, but later becomes a part of glee club director Will Schuester's (Matthew Morrison) all-male a cappella group, the Acafellas, hoping to impress the mothers at a performance for the school's PTA meeting. He subsequently joins New Directions along with two other members of the football team. When Finn's girlfriend Quinn is impregnated and tells Finn the baby is his, Puck realizes that he is the actual father, and offers to support Quinn. She rejects his proposal, calling him a \\"Lima loser\\". Puck begins dating Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), the glee club lead vocalist, after his mother urges him to find a Jewish girlfriend; Rachel is initially resistant, but agrees after Puck sings \\"Sweet Caroline\\" for her in front of the glee club. However, Rachel later breaks up with him after a brief romance. When the glee club holds a bake sale to pay for a wheelchair-accessible bus so Artie (Kevin McHale) can ride with the club to Sectionals competition, it only succeeds because Puck makes a special, popular cupcake recipe‚Äîhe secretly adds pot, which gives everyone the munchies. He offers financials to Quinn to show he will be a good father and provider; she figures out that it's the money from the bake sale, and refuses to accept it, though she expresses her gratitude and apologizes for abusing him verbally. Quinn reconsiders her plan to have the baby adopted and gives Puck a chance to prove himself by helping her to babysit Terri Schuester's (Jessalyn Gilsig) three nephews. Puck impresses her, but Quinn later learns that he was sexting Santana mostly. Puck claims he will be help her to parent their child, but he cannot remain in a committed relationship with Quinn if she refuses to have sex with him; Quinn returns to her original plan of giving the baby to Terri, who is faking a pregnancy to hold on to Will. Rachel begins to suspect that Puck is the father of Quinn's baby and tells Finn. Finn attacks Puck and confronts Quinn, who admits the truth. Puck again offers to be with Quinn, but she declines and tells him she wants to be alone, though she moves in with Puck's family since her parents had kicked her out and she can no longer stay at Finn's house. In the episode \\"Laryngitis\\", when Puck's mohawk is shaved off by his doctor, he finds the other McKinley students no longer respect him as a badass. He romances fellow glee club member Mercedes, once a popular cheerleader, to restore his status. His plan is successful, but he and Mercedes ultimately have nothing in common, and split when she quits cheerleading and he returns to his bullying ways. In the first-season finale, \\"Journey to Regionals\\", Quinn goes into labour immediately after the club performs at the Regionals competition, and Puck is in the delivery room when Quinn give birth to a baby girl, whom Puck names Beth. When Puck and Quinn visit their baby in the hospital nursery, Puck tells Quinn that he loves her. Beth is adopted by Rachel's birth mother Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, the show choir that defeated New Directions at Regionals. Season 2 In the season opener, \\"Audition\\", Puck is interviewed by blogger Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and reveals that he had a vasectomy over the summer, saying it was the only responsible thing to do. Soon after the school year begins, Puck is arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center for driving his mother's car through a convenience store window and driving off with the ATM. He returns in \\"Never Been Kissed\\", but he is now on probation and helps Artie out in an attempt to satisfy his community service, although this is only initially because Puck claimed he was \\"helping a crip\\" and they misunderstood him. Though he acts tougher than ever to his classmates, Puck eventually confesses to Artie that he was terrified in juvie, and the two come to the agreement that Artie will tutor Puck, who has to pick up garbage to fulfill his community service requirements. In \\"Furt\\", Puck, Artie, Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) confront Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) in the boys locker room to get him to stop bullying Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer). Because he was still on probation, Puck reluctantly had to watch the beat down between Sam and Karofsky, but despite not being allowed to fight and feeling helpless about it, he showed great restraint and was still praised for standing up for Kurt. \\"Special Education\\", Puck is asked by Will to find a new glee club member to replace Kurt, who has left McKinley and New Directions. He tries to recruit from the football team, but they lock him in a port-a-potty; he is rescued the next day by Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who becomes the club's new twelfth member. Puck gets intimate with Rachel at her instigation, but leaves abruptly, realizing that he doesn't want to betray Finn for a second time, though Finn dumps Rachel when she confesses to him about it. Puck and Finn finally settle their differences in \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", and they work together to help the football team win its first-ever championship. In the episode \\"Silly Love Songs\\", Puck unexpectedly falls for Lauren, and performs the song \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" by Queen, which expresses his love of Lauren's bigger body type, but Lauren is offended by the song. Santana, unhappy with being deserted by Puck, slaps Lauren in front of him to warn her away, and Lauren tosses her around like she was nothing, leaving her dazed. Puck immediately begs Lauren to go out with him. She ultimately agrees to go on a pre-Valentine's date with him, but stands him up. Puck clumsily tells Lauren he likes her, not because of her looks but because of her \\"badass-ness\\"; Lauren says she is not looking for something casual. They go out on Valentine's Day \\"as friends\\", though Puck is clearly hoping for more in the future. In the episode \\"Sexy\\", Lauren tells Puck she's decided to make a sex tape to help her become famous, to his delight, but their plans are dashed when substitute sex education teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) informs them that as both are underage it would be considered child pornography. As part of a class assignment in the episode \\"Original Song\\", Puck writes and sings a song for Lauren‚Äî\\"Big Ass Heart\\"‚Äîthat she likes. In \\"Born This Way\\", Puck discovers that Lauren had been a child beauty queen; he tells her he will run a campaign for her to become that year's prom queen, and be her king. After candidate Quinn insults Lauren's candidacy, Puck helps Lauren dig up dirt on Quinn, but the tactic backfires. Neither Puck nor Lauren win the race for prom queen and king, but they remain a couple; they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City, where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams. Season 3 Lauren breaks up with Puck at the beginning of school year and drops out of glee club, claiming that it is hurting her reputation. Shelby Corcoran, who adopted baby Beth, gets a teaching job at McKinley, and invites Puck and Quinn to be a part of Beth's life, provided they both become more responsible. Puck does so, and Shelby allows him to see Beth. Quinn decides she wants to regain custody of Beth, but Puck is torn, and tells Shelby of Quinn's plans. He spends increasing amounts of time with Beth, but then falls in love with Shelby. She sleeps with him once, though she tells him afterward she has made a mistake, to his disgust, and subsequently resigns from McKinley. One day his father visits him at work asking him for money for rent. This visit makes Puck fear that he might one day be like his father and visit Beth at work and ask her for money. He decides to be a father that Beth would be proud of and tries to do better in school and graduate with his class. After he fails his geography final and discovers that he is not graduating he decides to not care about grades and flunk out. In the episode \\"Props\\", he gets into a fight with Rick \\"The Stick\\" Nelson and pulls out a knife. Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) breaks up the fight and she informs Puck that he could get expelled from school for bringing the knife. He tells her that it's a prop knife that they used in their production of West Side Story and that he does not care since he is flunking out anyway. They have a heart to heart and the next day, she tells him that what he told her in their heart to heart the day before and it gave her the strength to leave her abusive husband. She told him that she owes him big time and that she talked to his geography teacher and she agreed to let Puck retake the test. In the season finale, Puck studies with Quinn's help and then retakes his final exam. He passes with a C‚àí and graduates from McKinley. Season 4 In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Puck has a paternal half-brother named Jake (Jacob Artist) who he was not aware of, though the two are introduced to each other by Will in the following episode, \\"Britney 2.0\\", while Puck is briefly visiting Lima from his new home, Los Angeles. Jake later turns to Puck for advice over the phone on how to get Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) to date him, and Puck subsequently invites Jake to visit him in California over the Christmas holiday; the two get matching tattoos. Puck decides to return to Lima to live, and the two Puckermans arrange for their mothers to meet on Christmas Day where the two families bond. Puck later starts dating Kitty (Becca Tobin) in order to keep her away from Jake and spoiling his budding relationship with Marley, though Puck and she break up when he moves into Finn's dorm room at the college Finn has just started attending, even though Puck is not enrolled there. He appears less frequently this season, despite still being credited as a series regular. Season 5 Puck makes infrequent guest appearances starting from this season. Puck is devastated by Finn's death. In \\"The Quarterback\\", three weeks after the funeral, he steals a memorial tree planted for Finn and demands that Kurt, Finn's stepbrother, give him Finn's football jacket. Coach Beiste takes him to task for being drunk regularly after so many weeks, and the two mourn Finn together, but Beiste tells him he has to guide his own life without Finn's help, and asks him to replant the tree. When he later does so, he tells her that he intends to join the Air Force. In \\"100\\" Now in the Air Force, Puck comes back to McKinley to say goodbye to the Glee Club before it is disbanded. He sees Quinn and the two of them have a conversation. He is about to tell Quinn that he still has feelings for her when her boyfriend, Biff McIntosh, shows up and shows Puck that he is rude. Puck sings Avril Lavigne's song Keep Holding On to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode The Purple Piano Project. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to snap and punch him. Biff punches Puck back, causing Puck to punch him once more and then throws him into the dumpster. He then tells Quinn that she can help Biff out of the dumpster or join her real friends in the choir room. Later, Puck and Quinn are in the locker room looking at Finn's plaque. Quinn tells Puck that Biff went back to Yale by himself, and the relationship is over. Puck reveals that he still has feelings for her and wants to get back together. Quinn tells Puck that she isn't going to look back to her past, as she wants to look into her future. Puck leaves the locker room heartbroken and storms down the hallway when Quinn runs after him and kisses him, agreeing to give their relationship another chance. Season 6 Puck returns in \\"Homecoming\\" along with fellow New Directions alumni to help Rachel and Kurt rebuild the club. He is still dating Quinn. Later in the season he attends Santana and Brittany's (and eventually also Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) and Kurt's) wedding in \\"A Wedding\\". He appears in the \\"Pilot\\" parallel episode \\"2009\\", taunting Tina Cohen-Chang's (then fake) stutter alongside Karofsky. He last appear in the series during the rededication of McKinley's auditorium to Finn Hudson and take a bow with the rest of the Glee Cast in the series finale. Musical performances As Puck, Salling features in many songs that have been released as singles available for digital download and are also featured in the show's soundtrack albums. He usually accompanies himself on the guitar for solo songs, including \\"Sweet Caroline\\", \\"Only the Good Die Young\\", \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", and the song ostensibly composed by Puck, \\"Big Ass Heart\\". Neil Diamond's \\"Sweet Caroline\\" was his first solo number, in the episode \\"Mash-Up\\", and received favorable reviews from critics, and also from Diamond himself, who had initially been reluctant to license the number to the show. Following the episode's broadcast, Diamond posted his approval on the social networking website Twitter, writing: \\"Hey, so who's this guy Puck singing 'Sweet Caroline' so good, so good, so good on #Glee? Loved it!!\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal described Puck's voice on the song as \\"earthly, sensual and full\\", and Entertainment Weekly Michael Slezak said that Salling did \\"more than a serviceable job\\". \\"Sweet Caroline\\" was released as a single, available for digital download, and charted at number 34 in the US, 22 in Canada and 37 in Australia. Reception Critical response Salling's performance as Puck received some positive reviews. Flandez said of Puck in the first-season episode \\"Mash-Up\\" that we finally saw him \\"emerging from his bonehead-punk exterior\\", and that he \\"wows us with his sensitive, cool guy turn as a solo singer\\" performing ‚ÄúSweet Caroline‚Äù. In her review of the following episode, \\"Wheels\\", Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"Mark Salling just seems to have a ridiculous amount of chemistry with all of the female cast members in the show, and it's fun to see him and Dianna Agron get in that food fight. Again, fun stuff, but a serious emotional core that keeps the show grounded.\\" Television critics responded positively to the pairing of Puck and Lauren Zizes. Robert Canning of IGN said the \\"absolute best part\\" of the \\"Silly Love Songs\\" episode was Puck's \\"unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: \\"For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that ‚Äúbad‚Äù at all. But it's always fun to watch Salling sing, and it's always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings.\\" In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck \\"a lot less assured\\" than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes \\"as endearing as they are unrealistic\\", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that \\"the ice around [her] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo.\\" Puck and Shelby's kiss in the \\"Pot o' Gold\\" episode was characterized as \\"creepy\\" and \\"super awkward\\" by AOLTV Crystal Bell, as either \\"super creepy\\" or \\"romantic\\" by BuddyTV's John Kubicek, and as \\"groan-inducing\\" in the \\"You're actually going to go there?\\" vein by Canning. Critics were polarized by Puck and Shelby's sexual encounter in the \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" episode. Kubicek declared that \\"the dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber,\\" MTV contributor Kevin Sullivan called it \\"the most divisive plot line of the season\\", and Bell asked, \\"Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?\\" Accolades In 2010, Salling was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star Male for his performance as Puck. His Glee castmate, Kevin McHale (Artie), was also nominated in that category, but neither actor won the award. In 2011, he was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Scene Stealer Male along with Glee castmate Chris Colfer (Kurt); again, neither actor won.

He was the leading architect in Arkansas from 1900 until 1930, and his designs were among the finalists in competitions for the capitols of several other states. Career From 1906 to 1912, Mann's office was a Beaux-Arts commercial building built to his design. It remains standing, at 115 East 5th Street, Little Rock, Arkansas. Beginning in 1913, he partnered with Eugene Howard Stern, as the architectural firm of Mann & Stern. Many of Mann's works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Family On June 28, 1910, Mann's daughter Wilhelmina married John N. Heiskell, editor of the Arkansas Gazette. Their children included Elizabeth, Louise, John N. Jr., and Carrick.

Immunities could be granted either as a privilege to the citizens of a state, exempting them from certain duties which would otherwise be incumbent on them, or they are given as honorary distinctions to foreign kings, states, communities or even private individuals. With regard to the latter the ateleia was usually an exemption from custom duties on the importation or exportation of goods, and was given as a reward for certain good services. Historical examples * Croesus received the ateleia at Delphi (Herod, i. 54) * the Attic Deceleans at Sparta (Herod, ix. 73) * Leucon, the ruler of Bosporan Kingdom, at Athens. (Dem. c. Lept. p. 466, &c.;) It appears that if a person thus distinguished, or a citizen of a foreign community possessing the ateleia, took up his residence in the state which had granted it, he also enjoyed other privileges, such as the exemption from the protection money, or tax which resident aliens had to pay at Athens. (Harpocrat. s. v. isoteles) This ateleia might even become equivalent to the full franchise, as, e. g. the Byzantines gave the exemption from liturgies, and the franchise to all Athenians that might go to Byzantium. (Dem. De Coron. p. 256.) In many instances a partial ateleia, or an exemption from custom duties, was granted for the purpose of encouraging commerce. (Theophr. Char. 23 ; Schol. ad Aristoph. Plut. 905, with Bockh's remarks, Publ. Earn. p. 87.) With regard to the inhabitants of a state, we must, as in the case of Athens, again distinguish between two classes, the resident aliens (metics) and real citizens. At Athens all resident aliens had to pay a tax (metoikion or xenikon telos) which we may term protection-tax, because it was the price for the protection they enjoyed at Athens; but as it was the interest of the state to increase commerce, and for that purpose to attract strangers to settle at Athens, many of them were exempted from this tax, i. e. enjoyed the ateleia metoikiou, (isoteleia equal rights) (Dem. c. Aristae): p. 691), and some were even exempted from custom duties, and the property tax or eisphora from which an Athenian citizen could never be exempted. The ateleia enjoyed by Athenian citizens was either a general immunity (ateleia apanton), such as was granted to persons who had done some great service to their country, and even to their descendants, as in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton; or it was a partial one exempting a person from all or certain liturgies, from certain custom duties, or from service in the army. The last of these immunities was legally enjoyed by all members of the council of the Five Hundred (Lycurg. c. Leocr. 11), and the archons for the time being, by the farmers of the custom duties (Dem. c. Neaer. 1353), and by those who traded by sea, although with them the exemption must have been limited. (Schol. ad Arist. Plut. 905, Acham. 39i); Suid. s. v. emporos eimi) Most information respecting the ateleia is derived from Demosthenes' speech against Leptines. But compare also Wolf's Prolegom. ad Lept. p. Ixxi. &c.; Bockh,Pz^ Econ. p. 85, &c.; Westermann, De publicis Atheniensium Honoribus et Praemiis^ p. 6, &c.; [L.

The character is portrayed by actress Amber Riley, and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Mercedes was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is a dynamic diva-in-training who refuses to sing back-up, and is a member of the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. Storylines Season 1 Amber Riley (pictured) plays Mercedes. Mercedes auditions for the school glee club, New Directions, by performing Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect\\". She develops a crush on fellow member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), unaware that he is gay. Though she is hurt when he rejects her, Mercedes is supportive when he confides his sexuality, and they become close friends. Mercedes has a rivalry with glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), which comes to a head in the episode \\"Sectionals\\", when she impresses the club with a rendition of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\". Rachel agrees that Mercedes should perform the solo competitively, but she loses the chance when a rival school steals the song. Frustrated with the lack of solos they receive, Mercedes and Kurt join the school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, as vocalists. Mercedes struggles when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) demands that she lose weight. She faints after crash-dieting, and is supported by former Cheerios captain Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who tells her that she is beautiful regardless of her size. Later, during a pep rally, Mercedes sings the song \\"Beautiful\\" by Christina Aguilera. Being a member of the Cheerios increases her popularity, and Mercedes briefly dates football player and glee club member Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling). However, she feels that she is being untrue to herself, so she quits the squad and breaks up with Puck. A friendship develops between Mercedes and Quinn; she invites Quinn to live with her family after Quinn's parents evict her for becoming pregnant, and supports her through the birth of her daughter. Season 2 Mercedes' friendship with Kurt is tested when they disagree over religion; Mercedes is a devout Christian, and Kurt an atheist. When his father has a heart attack, Mercedes convinces Kurt to attend church with her, devoting the service to the Hummels and performing \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" with her church choir for him. Kurt later develops a strong friendship with Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), a gay student from another school. He begins to neglect Mercedes, and offends her by trying to set her up with another student. When Sue Sylvester, temporarily Acting Principal, begins a healthy eating initiative at the school and declares a ban on Tater Tots, Mercedes organizes a student protest and fills the tailpipe of Sue's car with Tots, causing $17,000 worth of damage. Kurt suggests that she is substituting food for love and their friendship for a romantic relationship, and Mercedes agrees to talk to the student Kurt attempted to set her up with. She remains romantically unattached, however, and explains to Kurt and Rachel that sometimes it is necessary to choose between love and talent. Mercedes writes an original song entitled \\"Hell to the No\\" to be a contender for the glee club's set list for the Regionals competition; though director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) thinks it's a great song, he also doesn't think it's appropriate for the competition. When New Directions plans a benefit concert, Mercedes allows her performance slot to be moved to a less desirable place in the program; club member Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) is surprised by her failure to stand up for herself, and offers to be her agent, suggesting that she make diva-like demands to ensure they appreciate her talent. Ultimately, Mercedes takes the closing slot from Rachel by performing an overwhelming rendition of Aretha Franklin's \\"Ain't No Way\\" so good that Rachel doesn't even try to follow it. Mercedes attends the junior prom as part of a group with Rachel and fellow New Directions member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet). In the season two finale episode, \\"New York\\", it is revealed that she and Sam have begun secretly dating. Season 3 At the beginning of the third season, Mercedes says that she and Sam had dated for a while, but after he moved out of state she started a relationship with Shane Tinsley, a member of the football team. Shane encourages her to believe in her talent, and she auditions for the role of Maria in the school's production of West Side Story. Both she and Rachel are given callbacks. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and quits glee club. In the audition callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better‚ÄîMercedes is sure it is‚Äîand when they are both offered the role with half of the performances, she refuses to accept a split role; instead, she joins Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) rival glee club, and soon has recruited Santana and Brittany away from New Directions into the newly named Troubletones. The Troubletones lose the Sectionals competition to New Directions, and Mercedes and the others rejoin New Directions with the promise that the Troubletones will be given one performance number per competition. Sam returns to McKinley and attempts to rekindle his romance with Mercedes. She still has feelings for him, and eventually breaks up with Shane, though she refuses to date Sam while she is unsure of her true feelings. Sam continues to support her, and a YouTube video he posts of Mercedes singing results in her being offered a job as a backup singer in Los Angeles after she graduates. Season 4 Although still credited as series regular, Mercedes appears less frequently in the fourth season. She usually returns when there is an event in the lives of one of her friends back home in Ohio. She has moved to Los Angeles and is taking classes at UCLA while she works as a backup singer, though she returns to help with the school musical, for Thanksgiving, and for Mr. Schuester's ultimately failed wedding. She also returns in \\"Wonder-ful\\" to do a music video for her newly recorded album, but the record deal falls through. Season 5 In season five, she was demoted and credited as a guest star. She returned in the premiere episode \\"Love, Love, Love\\" to be present for Blaine's proposal to Kurt, and again for Finn's funeral and memorial in \\"The Quarterback\\". She sang \\"I'll Stand By You\\" as a tribute to Finn, who had sung it to the sonogram of what he thought was his and Quinn's baby in the first-season episode \\"Ballad\\", and later told her about doing so. In \\"City of Angels\\", she comes to support the New Directions since the nationals is held in LA, and it's revealed that she has landed a new recording contract. While there, she learns that a dejected Marley Rose has given up songwriting and is considering quitting the New Directions and, having mentored her before for Regionals, convinces her to keep following her dreams. In the special 100th episode, due to their recent success, she and Rachel (who was just cast in a broadway role) starts a rivalry, though they made up with each other in the end as they realize they are equally talented. She moves to New York with fellow glee club graduates for the rest of the season to record her album, and while there, rekindled her romance with Sam. In the season finale, she breaks up with Sam as she realizes she can't make him wait for her to be ready to lose her virginity. She went on a mall tour across the state with her high school friends, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) as her main back up. Season 6 She was promoted to the main cast again for the final season. She comes back to McKinley with all of the McKinley graduates to try to help Rachel recruit new members for the glee club in the episode \\"Homecoming\\". She later tries to convince Rachel to chase her dreams to be on broadway. In the series finale, Mercedes is going to be Beyonc√©'s opening act for her upcoming world tour, and gives a tearful farewell to her friends. In 2020, she is headlining her own world tour, and watches Rachel win an award. She's now dating Sam again. She attends the McKinley auditorium rededication to Finn Hudson, sings one last song with every former members of New Directions, and take a final bow with the rest of the Glee cast. Musical performances As Mercedes, Riley features in many ensemble musical performances, has had several solos and duets, which have been released as singles, available for download, and included on Glee soundtrack albums. Her first performance, \\"Respect\\" by Aretha Franklin, was included in full on the series' first DVD box set, Glee ‚Äì Volume 1: Road to Sectionals. In the episode \\"Acafellas\\", her performance of Jazmine Sullivan's \\"Bust Your Windows\\" was called \\"showstopping\\" by Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal. It was included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1, and released as a single, which peaked at number 35 in Ireland. Riley recorded a version of Dionne Warwick's \\"Don't Make Me Over\\" for the episode \\"Hairography\\". It was used as an instrumental within the episode, rather than performed by Mercedes on-screen, but was included in full on Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Her performance of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" in the episode \\"Sectionals\\" also features on this album. It peaked at number 85 on the Canadian Hot 100. The rendition of Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\" in the episode \\"Home\\" was called \\"so forced that it loses any power it might have from what's a genuinely nice arrangement of the song\\" by Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, while Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was \\"a great moment for not only Amber Riley but for the entire show.\\" The number peaked at 39 in Ireland, and 44 in Canada. Riley duetted with Colfer on \\"4 Minutes\\" by Madonna, which was included on the extended play (EP) Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna, and reached number 32 in Ireland. Additional duets include \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" by Sammy Davis, Jr. with Puck, and of \\"The Boy is Mine\\" by Brandy and Monica with Santana. The former was included on Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers, and reached number 72 in Canada, while the latter is featured on the compilation album Glee: The Music, The Complete Season One, and reached 46 in Ireland. In the second-season episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\", Mercedes performs Whitney Houston's \\"I Look to You\\", and led a choral rendition of Aretha Franklin's cover of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone commended Riley's vocals on the latter, and commented that series creator Ryan Murphy should assign Mercedes more solos. MTV's Aly Semigran felt that \\"I Look to You\\" was the episode's weakest song, preferring Riley's \\"more powerful\\" rendition of \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both numbers, as they left her \\"strangely unmoved\\". She suggested that, \\"Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didn‚Äôt seem truly transported by the music; so we weren't.\\" \\"I Look to You\\" peaked at number 74 in Canada and the U.S., while \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" reached 69 and 73 respectively in the same territories. Mercedes later assumed the role of Frank N. Furter in the glee club's performance of The Rocky Horror Show, and sang \\"Sweet Transvestite\\". The song was included on the EP Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show. Semigran felt that, as sung by a female, the song lost its shock value. Flandez would have preferred Salling's Puck in the role, but praised Riley's vocals, and wrote that her solo \\"woke us all up from the timid pacing\\". Anthony Benigno of the New York Daily News also enjoyed the number, and found that while Mercedes lacked the stage presence of Tim Curry, Riley did something \\"completely remarkable\\" as Frank, giving a largely flawless performance. \\"Hell to the No\\", Mercedes' original song, was titled for the character's signature catchphrase. Co-written by Glee music supervisor Adam Anders, composer Peer √Östr√∂m, and executive producer Ian Brennan, the piece peaked at number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100. In the episode \\"A Night of Neglect\\", she performed another Franklin song, \\"Ain't No Way\\". Her final solo of the season was Otis Redding's \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\", which was included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 6. During the season, Mercedes reprised duets with both Santana and Rachel: with the former on Ike & Tina Turner's \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\" and ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\", and with the latter on \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" from the musical Rent. \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" was included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 4 and peaked at number 30 in Ireland. \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" featured on the following album, Glee: The Music, Volume 5, and reached number 51 in the U.S. \\"Dancing Queen\\" appeared on the season's final soundtrack album, Volume 6, and peaked at number 74 in the U.S. Futterman criticized the arrangement of \\"Dancing Queen\\" for diluting Riley and Rivera's \\"power vocals\\", which, she said, \\"[gave] them the thin sound of ABBA's original even though they're both much better than that.\\" Mercedes featured in three of the third season's \\"Asian F\\" episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, \\"She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world.\\" Anthony Benigno, writing for The Faster Times, said that it was \\"great\\", but added that it was \\"not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one\\". Vanity Fair Brett Berk praised her \\"amazing voice\\" and gave the performance four stars out of five, and The Hollywood Reporters Lesley Goldberg characterized the rendition as \\"flawless\\". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that \\"really didn't work\\". TVLine critic Michael Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a \\"B+\\", as did Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West, who wrote, \\"Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking.\\" In her \\"Maria-off\\" with Rachel, Benigno said they \\"both kill it\\", characterized it as \\"easy but fun\\", and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom \\"didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner\\" but thought both singers were \\"fantastic\\". BuddyTV's John Kubicek thought that \\"Mercedes clearly won\\" and Flandez maintained that she \\"clearly outshone her rival\\", and continued, \\"You just believe so much of what she sings.\\" Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: \\"Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it.\\" Futterman had a slightly different take: \\"Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva.\\" However, Hyman thought that the two \\"were evenly matched\\", while IGN journalist Robert Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, \\"While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes\\". \\"It's All Over\\" from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an \\"A+\\" from West, who wrote \\"Mercedes was at her best in this performance\\", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an \\"A\\". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger called it \\"pretty awesome\\" and Flandez a \\"cleverly amusing take\\", while Futterman said Mercedes \\"fully embraces her inner Effie White\\" and that the song was \\"on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements\\". The \\"Mash Off\\" episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed, which was a mash-up of two Adele songs: \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\", with lead vocals by Riley and Rivera. It was acclaimed as its main highlight. Futterman wrote that the performance was one of Glee best sequences: \\"Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks from one of the year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment.\\" Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, \\"Journey to Regionals\\". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post awarded the sequence a \\"A+\\" grade, and Brian Moyler of Gawker asserted that the number was \\"perfection\\" and said, \\"This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life.\\". Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show \\"hit it out of the park\\" and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak gave the number an \\"A+\\" and wrote, \\"Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts.\\" \\"Rumour Has It\\" / \\"Someone Like You\\" debuted at number eleven in the Hot 100 issue dated November 23, 2011. It sold 160,000 digital downloads in its first week, the fifth-highest first week digital sales for the series. The mash-up sparked a revival in sales for \\"Rumour Has It\\", which achieved a new peak at number sixty that same week, during which it sold 42,000 digital copies. In Canada, the mash-up entered on the Canadian Hot 100 at number twelve on the strength of sales of 14,000 downloads. With the death of Whitney Houston three days before the \\"Heart\\" episode aired, a great deal of attention was given to Riley's performance of Houston's hit during the episode, \\"I Will Always Love You\\", and its unexpected function as a tribute to the singer. Reviews were glowing: Reiter called it a \\"gorgeous, lush take\\" that was \\"definitely an episode highlight\\", and Bell described is as \\"a beautiful cover\\", \\"the perfect song for Mercedes to sing to Sam\\" and a \\"haunting performance\\". Flandez wrote that it was a \\"heart-rending love song that becomes a homage of the 48-year-old fallen star\\", and \\"brought goosebumps\\"; the shot near the end, \\"of Mercedes dressed in a sweetheart gown, standing alone, reaching for the stars, was memorable\\". Chaney said that \\"Riley deserves a standing ovation\\", and that she sang the song with \\"a power motivated by genuine emotions that tied in directly to her storyline\\"; the \\"heartbreaking context of Houston's death ... immediately elevated this moment to the very best one of Glee entire third season.\\" Reception Ryan Brockington. for the New York Post has written that \\"the key to this show lies directly within the female leads\\", praising Riley as Mercedes and noting that in \\"Acafellas\\", Riley \\"finally got a chance to shine\\". Similarly, Stack commented that the best aspect of \\"Acafellas\\" was the focus it placed on previously more minor characters such as Mercedes. Eric Goldman of IGN criticised Mercedes' actions in the episode \\"Ballad\\", in which Puck confesses to her he is the father of Quinn's baby, and Mercedes responds by telling him to leave Quinn alone. Goldman questioned: \\"Really? She doesn't think Finn should know he's not really the dad? She doesn't think Puck should be involved, given he actually is the dad? It was a really strange response, and given Mercedes is not generally written to be an unlikable, manipulative person (That's Terri!), I'm not sure how the writers thought this was a justified viewpoint for her.\\" Korbi Ghosh of Zap2it has named Mercedes' best moment as her performance of \\"Imagine\\" in the episode \\"Hairography\\", commending her as: \\"instead of overpowering their performance with her spectacular talents, she toned it down, allowing the deaf choir to truly shine as she humbly sang beside them, showing her support.\\" Ghosh deemed her low point vandalizing Kurt's car in \\"Acafellas\\", commenting: \\"Mercedes has clearly got some anger and aggression issues ‚Äî not to mention being a bit clueless... the boy is into other boys, hello! ‚Äî But we'll forgive her. We got to watch her sing \\"I Bust The Windows Out\\" because of it, so it's all good.\\" Stack approved of the budding friendship between Mercedes and Quinn in the episode \\"Home\\", and added, \\"Their scene together in the nurses office was really touching and sweet. Damn, these kids can act.\\" The relationship between Mercedes and Shane was initially well received. Goldberg called their first scene together \\"adorable\\", and wrote that her \\"new love life seems to have refreshed the character on screen as her newfound happiness translates well\\". Hyman hoped their coupling would continue, though Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon.com lamented Sam's departure, as he felt a relationship between the two \\"would have been groundbreaking for all sorts of reasons\\". The Mercedes storyline in \\"Asian F\\" was met with widely divergent reactions. Many reviewers were unhappy with the return of the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including AOLTV Crystal Bell, who lamented that it had \\"been done every season\\". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first \\"booty camp\\" scene, including Hyman, Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting \\"wildly out of character\\" in the episode. Slezak was also puzzled at her change, and asked, \\"When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack for a bad week?\\" Canning agreed, and wrote: \\"Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field\\", and felt it added to the \\"inconsistency of these characters\\", even though \\"it ultimately made sense\\" in the context of setup for \\"It's All Over\\". Poniewozik wrote that having the story \\"turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now.\\" VanDerWerff was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it \\"the best part of the episode\\": it was \\"all about how she now feels appreciated‚Äîbecause she has a boyfriend, sigh‚Äîand so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions.\\" References  External links  * Mercedes Jones at Fox.com Category:Glee (TV series) characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional singers Category:Female characters in television Category:Teenage characters in television ","title":"Mercedes Jones"},{"id":"24189683","text":"Mohamed Youssef Ben Elhaj (born July 25, 1985) is a Libyan basketball player.

Tax benefits are available for both employers and participating employees, under certain conditions.  Section 79 plans  Section 79 details the tax consequences and requirements for employers wishing to install a group-term life insurance plan. Permanent life insurance may also be offered as an added benefit in a Section 79 plan. Section 79 plans are non-qualified as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, but still offer a tax deduction for sponsoring employers. An employee must include in gross income for Federal income tax purposes an amount equal to the cost of group-term life insurance coverage on the employee's life to the extent that the cost of the coverage exceeds the sum of $50,000 plus the amount (if any) paid by the employee to purchase the coverage.See subsection (a) of . Contributions to a Section 79 plan are tax- deductible, though for owner(s), and 2% or more shareholders, contributions are deductible only if paid by, and from, a C Corporation. A Section 79 benefit program may allow the following benefits. # The ability to purchase permanent life insurance with corporate dollars # Deduct all of the cost to the C corporation as a business expensepolicy loans and withdrawals reduce the policies cash value and death benefit and may result in a taxable event # Allow the transfer of corporate dollars to the business owner on a tax-favored basisalthough 100% deductible at the corporate level, contributions to a section 79 plan also provide an economic benefit to the owner and income tax will be required on approximately 60% of the contribution # Grow the money in the plan in a tax-deferred setting # Access to money in the plan can be achieved through policy loans on a tax-deferred basis # Death benefits can pass to heirs on an income tax-free basis. # There are no regulatory limits on funding for the key participants # May provide asset protection by removing plan assets from the reach of company creditors # Provides for minimal rank and file employee cost # Insurance cash values may provide tax-free income as long as the policy is kept in force and withdrawals do not exceed the cost basis A section 79 plan may be used for the following applications # Group life insurance benefits # Deductible insurance to fund estate planning needs of the business owner # Deductible insurance to provide personal life insurance needs for the owner # Deductible insurance to fund a buy-sell agreement or key man policy # Future business buyout on a tax-advantaged basis Determining the death benefit Death benefits can be determined by a number of different methods at the discretion of the employee: from a minimum coverage of group term insurance to a permanent benefit up to a pre-determined multiple of the employee's reported W-2 income. The tax consequences and funding commitment to the employee will be impacted by the option they choose within the plan. In the case of an employee making $245,000, if a 10√ó multiple is used, that employee will receive a death benefit equal to $2,450,000 ($245,000 √ó 10). The resulting contribution depends heavily on what product is being used for funding, as well as the employee's age and health. Calculating the tax liability In a non-discriminatory Section 79 plan, the first $50,000 of coverage is provided free to all employees. Any group coverage over this amount is deemed a benefit for which the employee must pay. The pure insurance portion is factored using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published Table I rates (scroll to page 5). If using permanent insurance the portion calculated as the 'permanent benefit' takes into account premium(s) paid, accumulated and cash surrender value, and other policy factors. Requirements There are generally four main conditions which must be met when installing a Section 79 plan: # The plan must provide a death benefit excludable from income under Code section 101(a) # Must be provided to a group of employees # Must be provided under a policy carried directly or indirectly by the employer # Maximum death benefits for each employee based on a multiple of compensation Non-discriminatory In order for a Section 79 plan to maintain its non-discriminatory form other conditions must be met: # Cover at least 70% of employees # No more than 15% of the participants are key employees # Benefits based on reasonable classifications Discriminatory It is possible to have what is deemed a discriminatory Section 79 plan. Under a discriminatory plan the first $50,000 of death benefit coverage is not free for owners and key employees. Cost will again be based on the IRS Table I rates. Rank and file employees maintain their free benefit whether or not the plan is discriminatory. Yet another set of requirements comes into play if the company has less than 10 employees. Under 10 employees # Employees with less than six months of full-time employment may be excluded # Benefits must be based on a uniform percentage of compensation or coverage brackets, such that no bracket is more than 2.5 times the next lowest bracket and the lowest bracket is at least 10% of the highest bracket With 10 or more employees Excluded employees * Employees with less than 36 months of full-time employment may be excluded * Employees under the age of 18 or over the age of 64 * Part-time or seasonal employees * Employees covered under a union contract, provided the group term life insurance benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining * Anyone not medically approved * Anyone choosing to opt out Coverage for spouses and dependents The cost of employer-provided group-term life insurance on the life of an employee‚Äôs spouse or dependent, paid by the employer, is not taxable to the employee if the face amount of the coverage does not exceed $2,000. This coverage is excluded as a de minimis fringe benefit. Some cases may allow more. Notes References * The Group Life Insurance Handbook, Darlene K.

Directed by Gautam Sen ( ‡¶ó‡ßå‡¶§‡¶Æ ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶® ), the movie featured Locket Chatterjee, Badsha Maitra, Biswajit Ray, Biswanath Basu, Kallol Dasgupta. This movie is Gautam Sen‚Äôs directorial d√©but.A DVD version of the film, later shown in different film festivals.  Plot  Based on a short story by Mohit Ray, Ekjon Jhumur ( Jhumur, the girl) is the story of Jhumur,(Locket Chatterjee )a self-respectful, independent-minded young lady of today in her late twenties. Her consciousness of life, morality and her own entity are intermingled with theater. The undaunted spirit places her above the nitty-gritty of daily life. She seeks emancipation through her medium of self-expression - the theater. Jhumur's family included her mother, younger brother Chhorda (Biswajit Ray), wife of her elder brother who are sympathetic with her sense of emancipation and also share with her joys and ambitions. Jhumur is professionally attached with a theater group named Nanarup. She also acts in another group in her locality in which Rajat (Badsha Maitra) is the director. Apart from her professional attachment, Jhumur's only refuge is her close proximity with Rajat, a theater director - already married and father of a daughter. From closeness to love or something beyond... Her love for life, theater, and Rajat become inseparable in such a way, she could not resist.. Rajat also seeks comfort in Jhumur's companion. The patriarchal society seems not to be tolerant with her sense of emancipation. It tries to delimit her within the conventional notion of womanhood. The inhabitants of the locality detest Jhumur's affinity with Rajat. The elders in the vicinity like Bhattacherjee or Mallickbabu are jealous about her. The youngers including local ruffians - Jaga, Patla and Buro use to tease her and even try to demean her publicly. Everyone is eager to snatch her freedom, she enjoys by engaging herself with theatre. They want to shatter her relationship with Rajat and teach a lesson. Incidentally, Rajat has to take the responsibility of directing a drama to be played in the annual function of the local club. Jhumur is in the role of a female lead. The local ruffians are also involved in collecting donations for the annual function, which Jhumur and Rajat detest. Everyone thinks - something has to be done. In the pretext of rehearsal, the ruffians took Jhumur to a wrong destination and raped her. Jhumur falls prey to the crime of the rapists. But who are the culprits? Is it the ruffians who committed the crime or the patriarchal society, who is the abater? The film seeks the question. There remains only one woman's fight against conventional society. A fight - Jhumur's own. Her armour - her challenge - the theater. \\\\---- External links  Film Festival: Humanity Explored.
