In 1957‚Äì1958 she worked as an assistant curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario. She traveled to London for postgraduate studies in American Ethnology at the British Museum and remained in England for several years, studying with Eric Stanford at Reading College.

Toronto, Ont: Prince Arthur Galleries. Career and impact In 1962 Kantaroff had her first solo exhibition at the Temple Gallery, London. She returned to Toronto for an exhibition at Toronto City Hall in 1968 and soon thereafter began an association with Galerie Dresdnere, which represented her through the early 1970s. In 1974, frustrated at the lack of a local foundry with capacity for casting her larger works, Kantaroff purchased the Toronto Arts Foundry in partnership with Al Green (Greenwin Investments).

The act is notable for expanding the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to include urban communities and for introducing new powers for Scottish Ministers to compel owners of abandoned or neglected to land to interested community bodies. Provisions Provisions of the act are spread over eleven parts, covering different areas relating to community empowerment and public participation in policy and planning. 30px This content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Part 1, National Outcomes, requires Scottish Ministers to continue the existing practice of setting national outcomes for Scotland, to which public authorities, people and organisations are to have regard when carrying out public functions. Ministers must regularly report progress toward them and to review them at least every five years. Part 2, Community Planning, creates a statutory basis for Community Planning Partnerships, imposing duties on them to involve community bodies in the delivery of local outcomes and to produce ‚Äúlocality plans‚Äù for particularly disadvantaged areas. Part 3, Participation Requests, provides a mechanism for community bodies to request participation in services to improve local outcomes, which can include community bodies taking responsibility for the delivery of services. Part 4, Community Rights to Buy Land, amends the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to extend the community right to by to communities of any size, allowing urban communities to register an interest in land granting them first right of refusal should the land come up for sale. The act also introduces a new community right to buy land which is abandoned, neglected or causing harm to the environmental wellbeing of the community. This allows Scottish ministers to compel private owners of land to community bodies if they deem the sale likely to contribute to sustainable local development. Part 5, Asset Transfer Requests, provides community bodies with the right to request to purchase, lease, manage or use land and buildings held by local authorities, Scottish ministers and other Scottish public bodies, of which relevant authorities will be required to create and maintain a publicly available register. In deciding whether to agree to asset transfers, public bodies are to consider the reduction of inequalities though there is a presumption of agreement unless there are reasonable grounds for refusal. Part 6, Delegation of Forestry Commissioners‚Äô Functions, allows for different types of community body to be involved in forestry leasing and to request asset transfers from Scotland‚Äôs National Forest Estate. Part 7, Football Clubs, provides powers for Ministers to make regulations to facilitate supporters‚Äô involvement in the decision making, and potentially ownership, of football clubs and give fans rights in these areas. Part 8, Common Good Property, requires local authorities to establish and maintain a register of all common good property which they hold. It also requires local authorities to inform and consult community bodies before disposing of or changing the use of common good assets. Part 9, Allotments, updates and simplifies legislation on allotments. It requires local authorities to take reasonable steps to provide allotments if waiting lists exceed certain trigger points and strengthens the protection for allotments. Provisions allow allotments to be 250 square metres in size or a different size that is to be agreed between the person requesting an allotment and the local authority. The Act also requires fair rents to be set and allows tenants to sell surplus produce grown on an allotment, provided this is not intended to produce a profit. There is a requirement for local authorities to develop a food growing strategy for their area, including identifying land that may be used as allotment sites and identifying other areas of land that could be used by a community for the cultivation of vegetables, fruit, herbs or flowers. Part 10, Participation in Public Decision-Making, creates new regulation-making powers enabling Ministers to require Scottish public authorities to promote and facilitate public participation in the decisions and activities of the authority, including in the allocation of its resources. Part 11, Non-domestic rates, allows councils to create and fund their own localised business rates relief schemes, in addition to existing national rates relief.

It describes the history of immunology with the discovery of the principle of graft rejection by Peter Medawar, and the way the body distinguishes self from not-self via natural killer cells. The compatibility mechanism contributes also to the success of pregnancy by helping the placenta to form, and may play a role in mate selection. Context =Author= Daniel M. Davis has a doctorate in physics from Strathclyde University. He was professor of molecular immunology at Imperial College and director of research at the University of Manchester's collaborative centre for inflammation research. Davis is a recognised as an expert in the field by the Nature journal of immunology. =Subject= The book's context is the history of immunology, from old questions about why we become ill and why we may recover to the 19th century pioneers who demonstrated that bacteria caused many diseases. In the 20th century where, slowly at first but at an accelerating pace, biologists started to piece together the genetic basis of variation and natural selection, and alongside that, the foundations of scientific medicine, including immunology. As Steven Pinker observes, few stories of scientific endeavour have never been told. \\"This is one of them. Ostensibly about a set of genes that we all have and need, this book is really about the men and women who discovered them and worked out what they do. It‚Äôs about brilliant insights and lucky guesses; the glory of being proved right and the paralysing fear of getting it wrong; the passion for cures and the lust for Nobels. It‚Äôs a search for the essence of scientific greatness by a scientist who is headed that way himself.\\" Book =Contents= Part One: The Scientific Revolution in Compatibility 1. Frankenstein's Holy Trinity : Davis tells the story of Peter Medawar's life and discoveries in graft rejection. 2. Self / Non-self : In this chapter, Davis tours the history of medicine from Hippocrates to the 19th century pioneers Pasteur and Koch, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet's concept of the immune system's ability to discriminate self from non-self. 3. Dead but Alive in Parts : Advances in understanding of immunity, from Karl Landsteiner's discovery of the ABO blood group system onwards, permit organ transplants to take place. The compatibility genes are named as three class I HLA genes (A, B, and C) and three class II (DP, DQ, and DR), each with numerous versions (alleles). 4. A Crystal-clear Answer at Last : Davis tells the human side of the story of the discovery of killer T-cells. Alan Townsend found that killer T-cells destroyed cells that carried an HLA protein and small fragments of viral protein. Those small peptides were all the evidence the T-cells needed to decide that a cell was diseased. Part Two: The Frontier of Compatibility Gene Research Diagram showing the complementary activities of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells 5. Differences between Us that Matter : Genetic differences from one person to another, like having the allele for Huntington's disease, can be small but decisive. An HLA protein variant, B*27, is associated with a serious inherited disease, ankylosing spondylitis, but also protects against AIDS. Other variants protected against other diseases. Perhaps the polymorphisms in HLA, the many forms each HLA gene can take, are maintained by natural selection for competing factors. 6. A Path to New Medicine : Variations in HLA genes may predict which drugs will be beneficial for individuals, implying a new era of personalised medicine. 7. Missing Self : Davis tells the story of how Klas K√§rre came up with the concept of the missing self, a sign (by the absence of an HLA protein) that a cell was diseased, and should be killed by a Natural Killer (NK) cell. Part Three: The Overarching System 8. Sex and Smelly T-shirts : The chapter describes the famous experiment that called for female partners to sniff boxes containing their male partners' T-shirts, which they had worn for two days. There was a slight association between finding the smell sexy and the two partners having different compatibility genes. It could possibly indicate sexual selection for outbreeding, at least in the HLA system. 9. Connections with the Mind : Davis describes what is known of the role of compatibility genes in the brain. 10. Compatibility for Successful Pregnancy Chorionic villi : The chapter tells the story of how the variable genes of the immune system affect the success of pregnancy. Far from the baby's HLA proteins somehow being tolerated by the mother (unlike anyone else's), the strong reaction against the baby's antigens helps to drive proper development of the placenta, in particular the growth of chorionic villi that ensure efficient transfer (for instance of oxygen) between mother and baby. Epilogue: What Makes You So Special? : Davis tells a story of genetic compatibility between his wife and himself. He finds himself wondering whether all women should have found him exceptionally attractive, at least when he was younger. He ends by observing that there is no hierarchy in HLA: some variants are good in one situation, and bad in another. =Publication= The book was published in paperback by Penguin in August 2014, . =Reception= The Compatibility Gene has been well received by critics and scientists. Mark Viney, reviewing the book in the New Scientist, comments that Davis covers human compatibility genes well, but that he should have gone into more detail on the different systems in other organisms. The science writer Peter Forbes, writing in The Guardian, notes that when Watson and Crick cracked the genetic code in 1953, it seemed that medicine would instantly profit: but half a century went by before the genome was decoded, and 98% of it seemed at first glance to be junk DNA. Now its complexity is starting to be understood, one function at a time. One specialised area is the immune system, with its own ultra-variable set of proteins. They are not only complicated, but have many functions, in immunity, sexual attraction (perhaps), pregnancy, and brain function. Unsurprisingly, Forbes observes, this makes immunology, and its popularisation, \\"extremely difficult\\". Davis \\"sugars the pill\\" by choosing to go into the researchers' lives and struggles in great detail. Forbes notes that Davis does not mention that most of the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees are to do with the immune system and brain development: perhaps (he suggests) these are connected. Nicola Davis, reviewing the book in The Times, writes that Davis \\"weaves a warm biographical thread through his tale of scientific discovery, revealing the drive and passion of those in the vanguard of research.\\" The tale of the pioneers such as Medawar is \\"fairly familiar but Davis's readable narrative allows them to be seen afresh\\". She finds the account more challenging as it approaches more recent discoveries, but with \\"plenty of rewarding moments\\". Emily Banham, reviewing the book for Nature, notes that compatibility genes lie at the heart of our immune systems, playing a part in the success of skin grafts, pregnancy, and more. The biologist Rebecca Nesbit, reviewing The Compatibility Gene for The Biologist, writes that Davis shares many stories of dedicated scientists, brought together by \\"a small cluster of 'compatibility genes' which play a large role in how we react to disease, and are central to how our immune systems work.\\" She notes that the book is as much about the people as the discoveries, but these are made worthwhile by the medical advances they keep producing, for example with possibilities for personalised medicine, as when people with one particular compatibility gene react adversely to an AIDS drug. She observes that all the same, he ends with the scientist's favourite refrain: \\"more research needed\\".

Space Capone has released three albums, two independently: Vol. I: Transformation (2008) and Vol II: Arrival, Arousal (2010); and Space Capone, through AVJ Records (2012). Early life Winters grew up on a farm in Carthage, Indiana and was influenced by his father's vinyl record collection including Jim Croce, Eric Clapton, and country music and oldies. He didn't start writing songs and singing until he was 17. Winters attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (2001-2003) before moving to Nashville, Tennessee and transferring to Belmont University in 2003. He released two EPs under his own name: Ocean Airliner (2004) and Supernatural Delight (2006), while living in Nashville. For the EPs, he had taken creative influences from his past and started to blend soul, funk and rock into his writing. Career =Vol I: Transformation (2008)= After releasing Supernatural Delight in 2006, Winters' influences began to diversify as he started listening more to late 70s and early 80s R&B;, such as Earth, Wind & Fire, Rick James, and Michael Jackson. He also began to experiment with falsetto vocals. He decided that creating a character to elevate the mystique behind the songs was necessary and came up with Space Capone. Winters said it looked good on paper and fit the music he was writing at the time. Vol I: Transformation symbolized his transformation from Aaron Winters to Space Capone. Once the songs were written, he hired arranger and musician Calvin Turner (Raphael Saddiq, Marc Broussard) to produce the album. Turner hired drummer Marcus Finnie (Kirk Whalum, Michael McDonald) and had him record all the songs with no accompaniment or music. All instruments and vocals were added after the drums had been tracked. Musicians on Transformation included DeMarco Johnson (keyboards), Court Clement (guitar) and Calvin Turner (bass, string and horn arrangements). The album was recorded in a house in Nashville. Winters was featured on TBS Entertainment's Sound Check in 2009. Nashville Scene reviewed the album by saying, \\"Harmonically sophisticated, Transformation is a commercial funk record that effortlessly combines banality and exactitude in its search for a plausible heaven\\". =Vol II: Arrival, Arousal (2010)= Winters formed a core band around the release of Transformation, including Ben Stix (drums), Drew Wilson (bass) Sam Farkas (guitar) Mikie Martel (trumpet, synthesizer), Joe D. Douglas (Saxophone) and Neal Dahlgren (keyboards). They began touring regionally in the Southeast. Space Capone began to garner a fan base, playing festivals including Nashville's Live on the Green Music Festival (2009), New York's CMJ (2009), Bulldog Bash (2010) and Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival (2010). The Bonnaroo performance was won by entering a live competition sponsored by BMI in competition with 28 other bands, where Space Capone and three other acts won the spot to play the festival. In June 2010 they played a Nashville Flood charity event, opening for Ke$ha. While not on the road, Winters worked as a carpenter in Nashville. He hired Calvin Turner again to produce the second release, Vol II: Arrival, Arousal. After getting some demo recordings together, Turner hired John Robinson to play drums on four songs, which he did remotely from his home in Los Angeles.

(Wyoming is south of the town of Spring Green). The building is on the Taliesin estate and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History The windmill was designed in 1896 after being commissioned by Wright's aunts, Jane and Ellen Lloyd Jones, who needed the windpump to provide water for their school,The Home News, September 23, 1897, p. 3. \\"The waterworks at the Hillside Home have been enlarged by a reservoir of 1000 barrels capacity tunneled into the rock of Sand Hill, back of the school building. ... This will give an adequate supply of water in case of fire or for irrigation.\\" the Hillside Home School. The diamond-shaped portion of the windmill intersects the portion with the balcony that sits on an octagonal structure. The balcony is accessible through an interior stairway. Wright named these two parts of the building \\"Romeo\\" and \\"Juliet\\". \\"Romeo\\" is the lozenge and Juliet, the octagon. Architectural historian, Neil Levine explained the principles behind the lozenge and octagon: > [Wright] gave the tower a bold geometric form as a structural solution to > the expression of the tower's role as a landmark. The pump rod and support > for the wheel are carried up within an acutely angled lozenge shape pointed > southeast to deflect blasts of wind like a \\"storm prow\\".

Edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, introduction by Kenneth > Frampton (1992; Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York City, > 1992), p. 195. According to the local Spring Green newspaper, The Weekly Home News, the windmill was completed in 1897.Weekly Home News, September 30, 1897. The Romeo and Juliet Windmill was the second structure the aunts commissioned from Wright. The first one, which no longer exists, was Hillside Home School I built in 1887. The third structure designed by Wright for the Hillside Home School was a stone educational facility, the Hillside Home School II, known today as the Hillside Home School, since it is the only one of the two that still exists. The Taliesin Historic District Romeo and Juliet is one of five buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on what became his property, which is now known as the Taliesin estate. From the windmill, it is possible to see three of the other structures on the Taliesin estate: his home Taliesin is on an adjacent hill to the north, Tan-y-Deri (his sister's house) is near the windmill's base, and the Hillside Home School is down the hill to windmill's south. Also on the estate is the farming structure, Midway Barn. Construction Originally clad in shingles, the windmill was later re-clad in cypress board and batten in 1938.William Allin Storrer. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion. University of Chicago Press, 2006, (S.367), p. 35. Repairs on the windmill were attempted by its owner, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and an effort on restoration was completed in 1992 by the newly formed Taliesin Preservation, Inc., which carries out restoration on the Taliesin estate with assistance from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.\\"Saving Taliesin: Preserving a Masterpiece\\" 88.1 WYCE March 4, 2017.

Gameplay The player uses the yellow periscope to aim at the moving submarines on the screen. Pressing the button on the right handle will fire a torpedo, and the goal is to shoot down all of the submarines in the fastest amount of time. The farther the submarine is, the more points the player will receive, with green being the closest, and red being the farthest. The game ends when the timer on the cabinet reaches zero. Reception and legacy The November 11, 1978 issue of Cashbox called it \\"\\"one of the most realistic\\" games of its kind \\"ever put into a cabinet\\", while the December 30 issue noted of the game's realistic design and gameplay features.

The Public High School enrolls 9th12th Graders in the Howard Lake-Waverly-Winsted Public School District. As of 2019, the school had 315 students enrolled. The campus consists of the High School, complete with a Gymnasium, the Laker Theater, the Middle School, with a field house housing three full-court basketball courts, a walking track, a weight room; a Football Field; the Track; several Baseball Fields; a School Garden; and the District's Bus Garage.  History  The previous building was built in 1930 and located in the city of Howard Lake. It had additions built in 1947 and 1954, as well as the addition of Humphrey Hall in 1966. In its latter years it served as the middle school for the school district after the new high school was constructed. But due to the expensive repairs that were needed, a new middle school was built and the old complex demolished with the exception of the Humphrey Hall area, which was renovated. That portion of the school is now home to the Meeker and Wright Special Education Cooperative as well as the HLWW Alternative Learning Program. It still possesses its gymnasium which is attached to Humphrey Hall which is also used for the Laker gymnastics practices and home meets. The current building is located between Howard Lake, Minnesota and Winsted, Minnesota. It was constructed in 2006 and connected to the Middle School in 2016.The Lakers text over the entrance of the building.  Extracurricular activities  HLWW is a member of the Central Minnesota Conference and will join the Wright County West Conference in 2021. The HLWW School District offers the following activities. Sports: *Fall ** Cross Country ** Football ** Volleyball *Winter ** Boys/Girls Basketball ** Gymnastics ** Wrestling *Spring ** Baseball/Softball ** Golf ** Track and Field Other activities: * Band *Choir *Cheerleading * Clay Target *Drama *FFA * KLKR StudiosKLKR Studios * Knowledge Bowl *Speech  The Laker Theatre  The Laker Stage, from the back of the auditorium with some of the stage lights turned on and an empty set. The Laker Theatre is an Auditorium located within the high school, which hosts the school district's band and choir concerts, plays and musicals, as well as occasionally hosting community productions. The auditorium has a main floor which has a seating capacity of 458 seats, and a balcony, only accessible by stairs which can seat an additional 130 persons. The auditorium was built with the school but was not finished until 2009, the balcony of which was not finished until the Middle School was added to the complex.  The Laker Gymnasium  The Laker Gymnasium has a main court with basketball lines and a main volleyball court in the middle of two roll-out bleachers. However, for some youth tournaments the gym can be converted to two courts by rolling back the bleachers and lowering a curtain which is above the half court line of the main court. There are motorized basketball hoops situated on the ceiling that can be raised and lowered depending on the requirements. The gym also has two Daktronics scoreboards which are used in tandem during main events but can be operated independently if the gym is separated to two courts. One of the scoreboards has additional side player panels which display additional information about active players during the game. The gymnasium located adjacent to the Laker Theatre in the High School hosts the Laker's home Basketball and Volleyball games, as well as Wrestling meets. It will also occasionally be the host site of some playoff games however the location is not ideal because of a smaller seating capacity, therefore larger games are scheduled elsewhere.  Campus  = Laker Football Field and Track = The Laker Football Field and Track is a prominent fixture on campus, as athletic events which occur here attract spectators. It contains the football field encircled by the track, and has bleacher seating, a press box on top of the bleachers, a Daktronics, football scoreboard which can be switched to displaying track results, stadium lighting, and a basic loudspeaker system. Early in 2019, a new, permanent concession stand was installed below the bleachers replacing a temporary trailer that had been previously used since the high school was built.  Football field  The natural grass football field on campus is a standard American football field, which is home to the Laker's Junior Varsity and Varsity home games. The field has irrigation lines which keeps the grass healthy during the summer. The football field's end zones and mid-field are typically painted with the Laker emblem with the help of volunteers. The team practices on a smaller field that is directly south of the stadium field and is irrigated as well. = Merger failures = Due to dwindling numbers in the football program, a proposal was brought forward to the school board August, 2018; to merge with the local Watertown-Mayer team to create a Co-op. This measure failed to pass as while it was approved by HLWW, Watertown-Mayer only approved a proposal which would have all the 'home' games be played at their field, to which HLWW did not approve. This created a large controversy among football parents and the activities department citing player safety concerns.  Track  The 400 starting side of the Laker Track. The Laker Track is a standard 400m track with a black rubber surface. The track has an additional space spanning the circle on the north end for high jump, and as an additional fenced-in area with three runways, two of which lead to triple and long jump pits, and one which has pole-vault capabilities. There are also sand traps for shot put in this area. Discus takes place on the football practice field on the northeast side of the campus. = Resurfacing problems = The track was resurfaced during the summer of 2016, and during the subsequent spring it was discovered that due to improper drainage around the track combined with heavy precipitation, pockets had formed under the track surface and pushed different parts up. Due to the safety concerns, no home meets were held there that year and the school was faced with fixing the issue. The track was resurfaced during the summer of 2018, which involved complete removal and installation of a proper drainage system.

This approach stands in contrast to routine practice in probabilistic programming where human developers manually write new probabilistic programs.  The framework  Bayesian program synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs. This strategy allows automatic synthesis of new programs via probabilistic inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model. This framework can be contrasted with the family of automated program synthesis fields, which include programming by example and programming by demonstration. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In traditional program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian program synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined. Additionally, Bayesian program synthesis can be contrasted to the work on Bayesian program learning, where probabilistic program components are hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.

Only a few members of this gens are mentioned in history, of whom the most famous is unquestionably the poet Publius Ovidius Naso, but others are known from inscriptions. Origin In his Tristia, Ovid explains that he was descended from an ancient family of equestrian rank, but only moderate wealth. He was born at Sulmo, in the country of the Paeligni, an Oscan-speaking people of central Italy, related to the Sabines and Samnites.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 68 (\\"Publius Ovidius Naso\\"). The nomen Ovidius would seem to belong to a class of gentilicia formed from other names using the common name-forming suffix -idius, in which case it might be a patronymic surname based on the Oscan praenomen Ovius. Alternatively, the name might have been derived from a cognomen Ovis, referring to a sheep. Chase also mentions a nomen Ofidius, an orthographic variant of Aufidius, derived from the river Aufidus; Ovidius could perhaps be another orthography.Chase, pp. 121, 122, 124, 139, 140.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. ovis, ovillus. Praenomina The praenomina found most frequently among the Ovidii are Lucius and Gaius, although they also used Quintus, Marcus, Publius, and in at least one instance, Titus. These were the most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The only important surname of the Ovidii was Naso, borne by the poet. This was a relatively common cognomen, describing someone with a large or prominent nose, although it is not known whether Ovid himself had such a feature, or whether the surname was originally bestowed upon one of his ancestors.Chase, p. 109. Members * Lucius Ovidius, the elder brother of Ovid, died at the age of twenty.Ovid, Tristia, iv. 10. * Publius Ovidius Naso, the poet, was trained as an orator, like his brother, and for a time pleaded in the law courts, before becoming one of the triumviri capitales, and subsequently one of the centumviri, then one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, both important judicial appointments. In AD 8, he was exiled by Augustus for reasons that remain mysterious.Ovid, Tristia, passim.Seneca, Controversiae, ii. 10.PIR, vol. II, pp. 441, 442. * Quintus Ovidius, a dear friend of the poet Martial, who owned a neighboring estate at Nomentum, where both produced wine.

Design The Ballplayers House recalls Vaux's design, albeit much altered in form and detail. In contrast to the brick and bluestone facade of Vaux's building, with its pointed arches and polychrome voussoirs, the facade of Ballplayers House is composed with graphic stripes of highly contrasting brick. In lieu of Vaux's bracketed eaves, pointed pinnacles and chamfered chimney, the new building boasts a simple roofline, topped with a sleek, factory-made cresting.

It is a shrub with thick, stiff stems, leaves with a sharp point on the tip and heads of usually cream-coloured flowers. Description Conothamnus trinervis is an erect or straggly shrub that typically grows to a height of and has thick, stiff branches. The leaves are usually arranged in opposite pairs, sometimes in whorls of three, long with three veins and a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are yellow, cream-coloured or white, occasionally purple and arranged in heads about across. Each group of three flowers has a bract at its base and the flowers have five sepals and five petals. (The other two species of Conothamnus lack petals, and the flowers are in groups of two.) Flowering occurs between August and October. Taxonomy and naming Conothamnus trinervis was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley who published the description in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (trinervis) is derived from the Latin prefix tri- meaning \\"three\\" and nervus meaning \\"sinew\\" or \\"tendon\\".

Upstream energy suppliers were obliged to compensate distribution companies for additional costs. PreussenElektra AG (now part of E.ON), a privately owned upstream supplier, complained that the law was not compatible with the prohibition on state aid, then in TEC article 92(1) (now TFEU article 107(1)) even though it was a requirement of private entities to compensate one another. PreussenElektra and the Commission argued that (1) financial duties on regional distribution companies, like Schleswag, reduced the undertakings‚Äô earnings, and reduced tax receipts for the states (2) the law converted private resources into public ones, with the same effect as a tax, and (3) because 6 of the 9 big upstream suppliers of energy were by majority state-owned, and 60% of shares in regional electricity suppliers were publicly owned, the payments should be considered state aid.

It is based in Lagos, Nigeria. History SystemSpecs was founded in 1991 by John Obaro. It was then more like a business to business company selling software to organisations. SystemSpecs started as a 5-man partner agent and Value added reseller for SunSystems, an accounting package developed by Systems Union, UK, (now Infor). The indigenous company developed HumanManager, a payroll Human Resource Management and goal management software package. This was developed with object-oriented COBOL. Media reports indicates that it enjoyed wide market acceptability with over 200 organizations across Africa as at 2004. TheSOFTtribe of Ghana signed a partnership deal with SystemSpecs in 2006 to provide 'HumanManager' for the Ghanaian market. The agreement authorized TheSOFTtribe to become Ghanaian partner of SystemSpecs for marketing, deployment and professional support of HumanManager. HumanManager went on to become \\"well established within the sub- regional ICT market.\\" HumanManager was described by the Nigerian media as \\"Nigerian's most successful software yet\\" when SystemSpecs launched HumanManager 4.0 in December 2002. The solution passed \\"a world class automated Quality Assurance test\\" in 2004. Infor FMS SunSystems and Infor PM are other SystemSpecs products. SystemSpecs recorded another major breakthrough in software development with the creation of the financial remittance software called Remita. HumanManager Developed by SystemSpecs, HumanManager is an intuitive, innovative and easy-to-use Human Capital Management Solution for organisations of all sizes and structures across Africa. The solution combines prosaic and innovative features such as payroll management, pensions, employee management, training and self-service among others. The functionality of HumanManager prompted its adoption across Africa, into such countries as Benin Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, to name but a few. Remita Remita is the e-payments and e-collections platform developed by SystemSpecs Limited. Remita, a Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) licensed platform, is developed in Nigeria and helps organisations and individuals receive and make payments. The software, which has become the flagship creation of the company, is used by the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment and collections of funds on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the treasury single account (TSA). It is also used by all 22 commercial banks and over 400 micro finance banks in Nigeria. Through TSA, the Nigerian government was reported to have saved \\"trillions of naira usually lost to corruption because of the opaque nature of government accounting.\\" The Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, revealed that 5.24 trillion naira has been realised as inflows into the TSA account following the mopping-up and direct debits of accounts of the CBN. He had earlier declared at the ICAN UK International Zonal Conference that the Federal Government of Nigeria had recorded 3 trillion naira ($15 billion) inflows into the TSA as at the first quarter of 2016 from Ministries, Departments and Agencies numbering up to 976. SystemSpecs released the Remita Mobile Application in March 2017. Paylink Paylink is SystemSpecs‚Äô recently released payment solution for individuals, businesses and NGOs. The solution enables users to receive payments easily by simply sharing a link with their payers via social media, email, WhatsApp, or other preferred channels, and is fast gaining acceptance among merchants across Africa as a fast, affordable and reliable platform for funds collection, especially for semi-formal businesses. The Treasury Single Account Controversy A Nigerian senator, Dino Melaye had claimed that the appointment of Remita, which he erroneously described as \\"an e-collection agent\\", was a violation of section 162 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution. He claimed that the constitution only recognised a banking institution to be the collector of government funds, and that Remita was not a bank. The senator said the one per cent commission charged by SystemSpecs for all revenues collected on behalf of the government from the various ministries, departments and agencies must be returned to the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He estimated the amount of commission collected by SystemSpecs to be twenty-five billion naira. In a letter titled ‚ÄúCommencement of Federal Government independent revenue collection under the Treasury Single Account (TSA) initiative‚Äù addressed to the press, the Central Bank of Nigeria refuted the senator's claims, describing them as \\"misleading\\". Nonetheless, SystemSpecs, as a \\"business decision\\" speedily obeyed CBN's directive that all the revenues made so far be returned pending the issue would be resolved. The Nigerian Senate consequently ordered its committee on finance and public accounts to \\"commence an investigation into the use of Remita since the inception of the TSA policy. Founder and Managing Director of SystemSpecs, developers of the Remita application, John Obaro, refuted claims that company pocketed 25 billion Naira. Obaro explained that the one per cent commission was negotiated prior to the signing of the contract; and the one per cent commission was shared by SystemSpecs, participating commercial banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria in the ratio of 50:40:10 respectively. PremiumTimes, an online news platform, released a report titled 'Full details of TSA: Dino Melaye misled Nigerian Senate on N25 billion claim' which cited holes in the senator's claims and allegations. The Joint Senate investigative committee also absolved SystemSpecs of any wrongdoing as ‚Äúthe committee could not ascertain the deduction/collection of twenty-five billion Naira (N25 billion) by SystemSpecs as 1% fee charged for the use of its Remita platform within the period under investigation.‚Äù .

It held that the Secretary of State could stop scheme supporting renewable electricity, without breaching legitimate expectations, misusing power, or unfairness in a judicial review claim. Facts Solar Century Ltd claimed the SS breached legitimate expectations, misused power, and acted unfairly by stopping the ‚Äòrenewables obligation‚Äô for larger projects. Solar Century Ltd installed large solar photovoltaic systems (solar farms). It benefited from the renewables obligation scheme that started in 2002. In 2011, the renewables obligation was replaced with a ‚Äòcontracts for difference‚Äô scheme. The government capped spending for energy and climate change. The Energy Act 2013, inserting Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, gave the Secretary of State power to close the renewables obligation to new capacity. This was initially proposed for 31 March 2017 for solar PV capacity over 5MW. A government statement said it would be ‚Äòmaintaining support levels for ... existing investments‚Äô. The SS then decided to close it on 1 April 2015, with the Renewables Obligation Closure (Amendment) Order 2015, saying takeup was higher than expected and its cap would be exceeded. It had a grace period to protect people who could demonstrate a significant financial commitment to projects at the consultation date. Solar Century argued they had a legitimate expectation from clear representations by government that the scheme would be open until 2017, the 2015 Order was ultra vires the Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, and it was unfair to specify a date in the past as one for identifying a significant financial commitment. The government's decision, to be put into the Renewables Obligation Closure (Amendment) Order 2015, and the subject of the challenge was extracted by Floyd LJ: Judgment Floyd LJ held that the government could change its policy where there were rational grounds, unless it amounted to abuse of power. No legitimate expectations were created that the date might not change. The Electricity Act 1989 section 32LA was wide enough to allow the SS to put forward the closure of the renewables obligation scheme. The grace period was not unfair, because if it were lawful to close the whole scheme in 2015 it was hard to see how giving some exceptions would be a bad thing. Tomlinson LJ and Treacy LJ agreed.

It was founded in Duluth in 1907 and is one of the oldest art centers in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Based on the curatorial model of the German \\"kunsthalle\\", the DAI is a community arts center that works closely with artists and the community, creating associated symposia, workshops, and studios. The Duluth Art Institute has two locations. The main exhibition space is located in the Duluth Depot, the historic train station in Duluth that also houses the Lake Superior Railroad Museum, the St. Louis County Historical Society Museum, a Veteran's Memorial Hall, and several performing arts organizations. A second location is situated in the former Lincoln Branch Library, a 1915 Carnegie library building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. It serves as a community center for arts education and houses multipurpose classroom spaces, a darkroom, ceramics studios, a fiber studio, and professional development services for artists. History The Duluth Art Institute originated as an art club established by Bishop McGolrick in 1897. In 1907, the Duluth Art Association was officially incorporated. The original Board of Trustees included G.G. Hartley and Chester Adgate Congdon. In the 1930s, the Duluth Art Institute Association, a separate arts organization, was active. The organizations merged in 1946, retaining the name Duluth Art Institute Association. The organization later dropped the Association from their name. In 1976, the Duluth Art Institute relocated to the St. Louis County Heritage and Arts Center. The arts organization opened an additional location in the old Lincoln branch library in 1993. The Duluth Art Institute hosts a biennial that dates back to 1919. Formerly called the Arrowhead Art Exhibit, it is now known as the Arrowhead Biennial Exhibition. In 1990, the DAI auctioned off the eight paintings in its permanent collection because it was not equipped to care for the works. The paintings included pieces by Knute Heldner, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Charles Rosen, and David Ericson.

The mountain is part of the North Cascades Range. Graybeard Peak straddles the North Cascades National Park boundary line, and can be seen from the North Cascades Highway at the Easy Pass Trailhead. Graybeard Peak is situated on Ragged Ridge. Other peaks on Ragged Ridge include Mesahchie Peak, Kimtah Peak, and Katsuk Peak. The nearest higher peak is Fisher Peak, to the south. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Granite Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Diablo Lake via Fisher Creek. Climate Graybeard Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. Graybeard Peak from Maple Pass loop trailAs fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Graybeard Peak and Little Tack The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Initially there was no reaction from Dmitry Medvedev or other high-ranking Russian government officials. On March 10, Medvedev blocked Alexei Navalny on Instagram. In response, Navalny led country-wide street protests on March 26, with a stated goal of forcing Putin and Medvedev to respond to Navalny's accusations.

P. \\"17 September\\", poem printed in The Orange Lily, 1849, transcript at Cook, op.cit., p. 288. published in the Orange Lily, documenting the 1849 'Stoney Monday' riot in the ByWard Market of Bytown, Lett sides with the Tories and Protestants against the Reformists and Catholics. Although he moderated his views later in life, Lett remained an active and lifelong member of the Orange Order becoming Secretary for the Bytown District of the Royal Scarlett Lodge of Orangemen Number 119 in 1850. By 1862, Lett had also risen to third degree standing in the Grand Doric (Ottawa) Lodge of the Masons of Canada and graduated as Master Mason in 1888. His memberships in the Orange Order and the Freemasons were not only expressions of his Protestantism, temperance and loyalty to the British Crown, but also provided the contacts and networks important to furthering his career. Theatre pioneer The first recorded theatrical performances in Bytown were by the Garrison Club of the 15th Regiment staged in the barracks on what is now Parliament Hill. However, this was followed by 13 years of thespian silence until, in 1850, Lett organised and presided over Bytown's first drama club in the town hall. In 1854, he promoted his anti-slavery agenda with a staging of Uncle Tom's Cabin by a professional troupe from New York. The 12 performance reception prompted the building in the same year of Her Majesty's Theatre on Ottawa's Wellington Street with a seating capacity of one thousand people; one seventh of the city's population. Ottawa's boom in theatre construction and play production followed for the remainder of the century.Watt, Mrs. R. M.

He had risen in social standing to become a justice of the peace, a coroner, and councillor, reeve and Warden in Carleton County. His father, William Hinton, had escaped being burned alive in a barn in Ireland during the Scullabogue Massacre of 1798, thanks to a warning by a faithful Catholic maid who lost her own life in the fire. Joseph deplored the fanatical strife in Ireland stoked in part by the Orange Order. He supported the alternative Protestant Benevolent Society of Ireland which was not anti-Catholic; thus he had little time for Lett, the Orangeman journalist. Maria and William had to elope to be married in the Methodist chapel in Huntley.Wm.

Lett held the power of the civic pen and had the ear of nineteen Mayors of Ottawa. According to his obituary in the Ottawa Evening Journal, he proved an indispensable civic speechwriter, \\"To speak of Mr. Lett's merits without mentioning his usefulness outside of his mere routine duties, and of his large-hearted liberality, where his sympathy was enlisted, would be regrettable. Many a Mayor, in the earlier days of the City, had reason to rejoice that one better educated and better qualified for literary work than the occupant of the Chair was at hand when the address, motion or memorial had to be penned. The City Clerk had read extensively and was possessed of a memory reliable to the last degree. Give him the subject to be spoken of and in half an hour the document would be produced that would stand the test of the refined and the educated.

He assumed the additional duty of acting Clerk to the Police Court of the new City until his son William Pittman junior took over in 1881. On occasion, he undertook the hazardous job of accompanying prisoners to the Carleton County jail in Perth along the bush road where accomplices often sought to free them.\\"City Council ‚Äì Miscellaneous Expenditures\\", The Ottawa Times, Saturday 21 April 1866, vol. 1, No. 106, p. 2, col 5. Lett recognised the importance of having well-designed physical infrastructure to sustain a burgeoning Capital City. In 1871, he arranged for a fellow mason and subsequently his tenant, Arthur R. Sowdon to be hired away from his Deputy City Surveyor position in Montreal to the post of Ottawa City Engineer.Ottawa City Council, 31 May 1875, Motion Concerning Compensation to Mrs Sowdon, moved by Aldermen Rocque ans Pratte. Lett eventually attained such stature as a civic leader as to have had his short biography published with those of the mayor and city council in 1887 for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The accompanying commemorative photographic card shows Lett in pride-of-place, flanked by the Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald and Dominick Edward Blake, Leader of the Opposition Liberal Party, at the inverted apex of triangulation with the images of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and as the foundation supporting Mayor Stewart McLeod and City Hall.Mayor and Aldermen, City of Ottawa, Jubilee Photograph, 1837‚Äì1887, City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-11-427. Lett's close friendship with Prime Minister John A. Macdonald is evident from frequent personal correspondence.Cook, op. cit., pp. 55‚Äì56 and pp. 403‚Äì404. City Council capitalised on this when instructing Lett to prepare resolutions and arrange for delegations to meet with the Prime Minister and Government Committees. A resolution was passed on 6 December 1882 that a Special Committee should meet with the 'Premier of Canada' to create a capital city district similar to the District of Columbia, under the immediate control of the Government of the Dominion. Although this fell on deaf ears, it may be taken as the earliest suggestion for a National Capital Region.Lett, W. P.

The Bytown Mechanics' Institute: Improving the Mind of the Working Class, Bytown Pamphlet Series #39, 1992. p.6 It was replaced by the opening of the francophone Institute Canadien Fran√ßais d'Ottawa in 1852 and the anglophone Bytown Mechanics' Institute and Athenaeum (BMIA) on 29 January 1853. The BMIA hosted many local lectures, allowed female, Catholic and working class memberships, held picnics for wives and their families and curated a large newspaper and periodical library and local natural history museum. In 1856, the BMIA changed its name to the Ottawa Mechanics' Institute and Athenaeum (OMIA) to reflect the City's incorporation.

His speech is described as \\"characteristically eloquent\\". He often used his sense of humor to convey an intellectual message, for example, spoofing the Ottawa Literary and Scientific Society in December 1876 with an extensive pseudo-scientific analysis of the rings of Saturn.Lett, W.

He exchanged poetry with the Countess.\\"Lament of the Irish Mother\\" by Lady Dufferin\\", The Historical Society of Ottawa News, issue 142, September 2013, p. 6. =Principles and morality= Lett was an opinionated man of high principles and morality, unafraid to speak his mind forcefully and directly. He frequently opposed slavery in his verse and prose.Lett, W.P. Open letter to the Editor Opposing Slavery, Ottawa Citizen, 29 January 1861 He was concerned that any revival of the movement to annexe Canada to the United States would reintroduce slavery into Canada, the destination to freedom for slaves using the Underground Railroad until abolition in 1865. In his Address to Brother Jonathan published in 1889,Lett, W. P. Annexation and British Connexion, Address to Brother Jonathan, Ottawa, Mason and Jones Printers, 48&50 Queen Street, 1889, 20pp. Lett publicly reprimanded the American President for not pursuing policies to \\"crush the aspirations of the South\\" and improve the conditions for former slaves after their \\"expedient emancipation\\". In that same Address, he declared his moral positions on many issues in a vitriolic exhortation to the President. \\"Abolish the free love of your infamous Divorce Court‚Ä¶make your laws supreme‚Ä¶banish the bowie knife and the revolver (carried as concealed weapons)‚Ä¶purify your judicial bench‚Ä¶reconstruct your election laws‚Ä¶keep your greenbacks out of the ballot-box‚Ä¶endeavor to get an honest expression of political opinion‚Ä¶and try a dose of national probity... if moral blood- poisoning has not enervated your system beyond redemption\\".

Lett set the context: Written on reading an account of a society recently formed in Augusta, Georgia, for the purpose of putting an end to the dangerous practice of carrying concealed weapons. His newspaper editor added the following footnote: The reader will draw the distinction between a defensive weapon under certain necessary and peculiar circumstances and the terribly dangerous and reprehensible practice of habitually carrying concealed and murderous offensive weapons argued for their banning in the wake of the assassinations of US presidents Lincoln and Garfield, and of Canadian politician and fellow poet, Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868,Lett, W.

He penned political satire in the Citizen newspaper under the pseudonym of Jeremiah O'Casey, writing from Washington, D.C. He was proud that Canada embraced the Constitution secured by the British Revolution of 1688 as the ideal model for governance, with a constitutional monarchy subject to law but retaining some political power; a mixed constitution between absolute monarchy and republican democracy.Lett, W.P.

It would be going too far to suggest that Lett supported the nascent suffragette movement. He prefaced his poem WomanLett, W.P. Poem Woman 10 December 1848, transcribed in Cook, op.cit., pp. 220‚Äì222. with the widely-held opinion that a woman's God-given mission is to procreate and train her children for life on Earth and in Heaven. However, he supported a view that injustice is done to woman by public opinion, compared with its treatment of man, under precisely similar adverse circumstances‚Ä¶society did not require to be any more severe, any more uncharitable as respects women in this particular, but justice did call for similar treatment, to men, under like circumstances.Lett, W.P. Temperance Readings‚Ä¶.Good Programme and a Capital Evening's Fun _ Women's Rights etc newspaper clipping, in City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1 He defined woman as \\"the 'summon bonum' of existence, without whom this earth would be a desert and life blank. Women have humanising and refining influence upon society, an influence stronger than physical force, more potent than law. Women ought to be first, not merely as a courtesy, but because women are the mothers of us all\\".Lett, W. P. \\"An Address on 'Woman'\\" given at the Duke Street School House, Entertainment in Aid of the Poor, 30 January 1877, found at City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1, p. 57. Lett was charitable towards those who he felt deserving. In his 1847 poem, The Famine, he called for international aid to the starving of the Great Famine of Ireland (1845‚Äì1852).Lett, W. P. The Famine Bytown, 27 March 1847. In his poetry he had little pity for The Deserter but, in 1880, urged forgiveness for a ninety- five-year Old Soldier of the Napoleonic wars who was being punished for vagrancy.Transcripts at Cook, op.cit., \\"The Deserter\\" pp. 154‚Äì155, \\"The Old Soldier\\", pp. 197‚Äì198. =Patriot= Lett was an avowed patriot of the British mother countries of England, Ireland and Scotland. His poetry is filled with accounts of British heroism, the glories and defence of the Empire and British cultural and engineering supremacy. Queen Victoria, her consort, her children and her vice-regal Canadian Governors' General are praised. He lambasts domestic and British politicians who challenged Throne or whose trade or foreign policies, such as those of William Ewart Gladstone, threatened Canada's economic or social security. He attacks political and provincial opponents of Confederation. The British Connexion had to be maintained at all costs. He campaigned in prose and verse to retain the Union Jack during the national flag debate that followed the signing of Confederation.Lett, W. P. Poetry on \\"Homelands\\", \\"Loyalty, Royalty and the Flag\\" and \\"Imperial Wars and Warriors\\", transcriptions at Cook, op.cit., pp. 144‚Äì199. Lett could read of global news in the foreign dispatches of the newspapers. He was concerned about the defence of the British Empire especially in India and Africa, and the shifting balance of power in Europe. His poetry in the same newspapers reflects his fear of Russian and more particularly Prussic-German imperial ambitions for Europe and the world, believing prophetically that, in the long run, not even the Americas would be immune. He laments the fate of Poland and even that of France after the calamitous siege of Paris in 1871. He warns America not to fuel these conflicts through international trading in guns and munitions. He keeps a wary eye on the republican experiments in Europe and North and South America, fearing that Canada might deviate from a path towards a monarchical confederated constitution grounded in British law and emulating British parliamentary structure and process.Lett, W. P. Poetry on Imperial Wars and Warriors particularly \\"Fame\\" and \\"Consequential Damages\\", transcriptions at Cook, op.cit., pp. 175‚Äì199. Lett's previously mentioned 1889 Address to Brother Jonathan, Annexation and the British Connection is an aggressive, twenty-page polemic on Canadian independence and patriotism. In the Address, he characterises Americans as having been \\"led astray by incorrect information‚Ä¶and with supreme self-possession, you smoke your cigar, you think of the 'Monroe doctrine', and ponder over the visionary dream that Canada will yet form a part of your country\\". He bluntly tells America to leave Canada to prosper under a system of government connected to the British monarchy and preferable to republicanism. He challenges America to stop its diplomatic and military belligerence toward Canada, and ends with a version of his patriotic poem of passionate loyalty to the British Connexion.Lett, W.

Until his death in 1892, Lett opposed any traitorous hint of annexation, even after the debate had shifted to trade reciprocity or stronger commercial union. Around 1891, an old and terminally ill Lett still had the conviction to pen a damning indictment of the Canadian politicians Sir Richard Cartwright and Solomon White, and journalist Erastus Wiman for their support of free trade by reciprocity and for rekindling the old Canada Annexation Debate of the mid-19th century: they are the badger, muskrat and skunk making treasonable misrepresentations to allure Canadians from their allegiance and supporting the bald headed eagle, the unfortunately selected emblem in the Yankee Escutcheon, [to be] the plundering harpy who wants to rob the Canadian Osprey of his dinner.Lett, W.

The Recollections are a series of extended poems mostly in rhyming couplet form describing Bytown's notable residents, their locations, characters and occupations, portrayed on a detailed historical and geographic canvas. Much of Lett's other poetry details significant local events and personalities. Lett gave at least three \\"carrier addresses\\" in verse, one to the Orangemen published in the Orange Lily in 1850,Lett, W.P. \\"New-Year's Address To The Readers Of The Orange Lily\\", Bytown, 1 January 1850, published front page of The Orange Lily and Protestant Vindicator vol.1, #13 one as a poem for 1859/60 \\"To The Patrons of the Union (Hotel)\\", and one for 1871/72.

Sportsman thumbWilliam Pittman Lett with Shot Gun and Hound, ca.1865 (E. Spencer / City of Ottawa Archives) Lett was an enthusiastic sportsman. He shot birds, fished from his birch-bark canoe, and camped out on yearly deer hunting expeditions with his personal hounds and a band of close friends including the Iroquois hunter, Eustache.Lett W.P.. Poem: Eustache Cook, 26 November 1872, published posthumously in the Ottawa Citizen; transcript at Cook, op.cit., pp. 206‚Äì207. His was a nature born to love nature, and no boy was happier than he when he could leave the haunts of men and seek the solitudes along the banks of the Ottawa and Gatineau Rivers or minor streams and 'haul the silvery shining prey from the whirling eddy's spray'. As a huntsman in the early days of Bytown, he was acquainted with every nook and corner of Carleton, Russell and Ottawa counties and he admits in his own writings that it would have been well for him had he devoted less time to such pursuits. To the last days, when he was hardly able to make his way to his desk at city hall, he would long to get away into the silence of the woods or beside the stream for a quiet fishing expedition.\\"Obituary Ex- City Clerk W.P. Lett\\", 1892 newspaper clipping, Lett Scrapbook, City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1. It is therefore understandable that Lett related to the aboriginal belief in the spiritual hierarchy of Manitou and wrote an article on the spirits of the Manitou Rapids on the Gatineau River.Lett, W.

There was no Ottawa Hunt Club in the 19th century, so formal hunts involving the highest in society were organised as the occasion warranted. In 1870, one such hunt was organised for Prince Arthur during his visit to Ottawa and tour of Canada; Lett controlled the deer runway where Governor General Lord Lisgar was shooting.The Canadian illustrated News: [Vol. 1, no. 13 (29 January 1870)] Montreal : G.

As an avid hunter and patriotic armchair warrior, Lett was well versed in cannon and guns. He often alluded to progress in efficiency, accuracy and distance brought by technological advancements from muzzle to breach loading and the internal rifling of barrels. He sketched a history of military weaponry in his poem The SniderCook, transcript at pp. 184-186. and often praised the virtues of that British army-issue rifle in defence of the Empire. He authored under his pen name Algonquin, a 30-page history of his sporting life and the evolution of guns: From the Flintlock to the Hammerless.Lett, W. P., From the Flintlock to the Hammerless ca. 1880, 30pp, donated by Bill Lett to City of Ottawa Archives/Can.2013.0107.1. For his 25th anniversary as Clerk, Ottawa City Council presented Lett with a high-quality fowling piece (a choke-bore hunting rifle), manufactured by W.W. Greener (of Birmingham, England).For an excellent history see Greener, W. W. The Gun and Its Development, ninth edition, Cassell and Company, 1910.

Hero One Sunday in the late spring of 1881, a boy named Louis Robillard tipped from a boat into the Ottawa River beside the Queen's Wharf, Ottawa's former Cholera Wharf.Malaria on the Rideau Canal, Ontario, Canada, Cholera Epidemics in Ottawa / Bytown, 1832, Other 19th Century Diseases. Lett, by then 62 years old, dove in fully clothed and grappled with the panicking youth in a dangerous current close to the stern of a flat-bottomed barge. When they surfaced, a bargeman hauled them on to a boat before they were sucked beneath the barge. Newspaper headlines declared Narrow Escape From Drowning; Gallant Rescue by our City Clerk ‚Äì The Latter Nearly Meets a Watery Grave and Lett was awarded the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society on 18 July 1881. Later life and death =Widower= Lett's wife, Maria Hinton, was killed on Saturday, 3 September 1881, a month shy of fifty-three years old. The rear boxcar of a train of the St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway (SL&OR;) struck her phaeton while it was being driven northwards across the tracks at the intersection of Ottawa's Dalhousie and McTaggart Streets adjacent to the company's freight sheds and passenger depot. Lett won his case against the SL&OR; for negligence. He was awarded damages of $5,800, of which $1,500 was apportioned to himself and the balance divided among the children. The SL&OR; was subsequently taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Supreme Court, on a split decision, dismissed the appeal of the CPR with costs: \\"Although, on the death of a wife caused by negligence of a railway company, the husband cannot recover damages of a sentimental character, yet the loss of household services accustomed to be performed by the wife, which would have to be replaced by hired services, is a substantial loss for which damages may be recovered, as is also the loss to the children of the care and moral training of their mother. (Taschereau and Gwynne dissenting)\\".\\"St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett\\", Supreme Court of Canada Record 422, 16 November 1885 . Her death was a devastating loss for William and their children. He kept two small photographs to remind him of Maria inscribed with the same words written on 12 November 1882: \\"Silent in death, She speaketh still, I hear her voice, I feel her hand Greeting me in the upward path Which leads me to the Spirit Land, And O! my heart's incessant prayer Is that I yet may meet her there.\\"Cook, op.cit., transcripts at pp. 87 and 336. =Retirement= An ageing Lett of 65 years was tiring of his City Clerkship and applied in 1884 to become Librarian to the Parliament of Canada following the death on 22 January 1884 of the incumbent, Dr. Alpheus Todd (1821‚Äì1884). Prime Minister Macdonald did not reply.Lett, W. P. Dominion librarianship application, 25 January 1884, Sir John A. Macdonald papers, Volume 7, #2052‚Äì3 Library and Archives Canada.

A postmortem was conducted as his long sickness has not been fully understood by his medical advisors. It proved to be metastasized cancer of the spine. By order of the City Treasurer, Thomas Halder Kirby, the City Hall flag flew at half-mast; officials ordered a floral tribute; and Council unanimously approved a resolution of honour and a motion for a fully paid public funeral in recognition of his long and faithful services.The Last Honors, Special Resolution of Ottawa City Council, 1892. Lett's funeral cortege with a four-horse hearse was one of the largest ever seen in Ottawa, and included some of the oldest and most prominent citizens. It proceeded past closed stores along Ottawa's Sussex and Sparks Streets to the Dominion Methodist Church. He was buried beside his beloved Maria on Wednesday, 17 August 1892 at Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery, sharing a monument with the Hinton and Grant relatives. Lett was a household name during his life and it became a source of pride for Ottawans to claim that their loved ones were immortalised in his works. Lett Street is a short residual street on Ottawa's LeBreton Flats. His grave is obscure and the monument almost indiscernible by the weathering of time. It is a poor tribute to one who had contributed so much to the heritage of Canada's capital. Bard In all but title, Lett was Ottawa's first poet laureate producing some two hundred and twenty-two poems and songs in his lifetime not including the many snippets of verse with which he habitually embellished his public speeches. His poetry provides a poetic editorial on many personalities and events in Canada's 19th century. His topics include: affection and romance; religion; homelands; loyalty, royalty and the flag; imperial wars and warriors; sporting life; social commentary; Bytown to Ottawa; colony to nation; bereavement, grieving and solace; reflections; and poets, poetry and songsters. They are full of the religious and political fire-and-brimstone rhetoric of the time. One hundred and two were published in the newspapers or presented to an audience.Cook, transcripts and historical contexts at pp. 100‚Äì388. In addition to newspaper publication and invited addresses to associations and society events, Lett orchestrated public recitals of traditional poetry, his favourite poets and his own works.Lett, W. P. \\"Selections from the Standard Poets\\", English Church Readings, Gowan's Hall, Friday 9 April 1870, The Ottawa Times, 18 April 1870. In his 1878 \\"Address to the Annual Entertainment of the St. Patrick's Literary Association\\",Lett, W. P. Address Delivered at the Grand Opera House: at the Annual Entertainment of the St. Patrick's Literary Association, 18 March 1878, p. 5. he saluted the \\"genius and immortality\\" of a long list of \\"statesmen, sages, warriors, philosophers, orators and poets\\" who had influenced his writing. His greatest influences were Burns, Walter Scott, Byron, Victor Hugo \\"that Moses of the modern gospel of Freedom, Humanity and Romance\\" and his favourite, the Irish bard Thomas Moore . However, contemporary anthologists were not impressed. Mrs. C.M. Whyte-Edgar, in her Wreath of Canadian Song published in 1910,Whyte-Edgar, Mrs. C.M. A Wreath of Canadian Song, Toronto, W. Briggs, 1910, 283pp listed Lett \\"among others, writing since the middle of the last century, [who] won, in some cases, more than local attention\\". His short biography was included by C. C. James in A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry, published in 1899.James, C. C. A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry, Toronto, W. Briggs, 1899. One of his poems, \\"Call Me by My Christian Name\\", was included in E. H. Dewart's 1864 Selections of Canadian Poets.Dewart, E. H. Selections of Canadian Poets, Montreal: J. Lovell, 1864 (304pp), pp. 260‚Äì261. Lett was too busy to take the time to publish an anthology of his own poetry other than his Recollections and the \\"British Connexion\\". The former, written in near doggerel cemented his obscurity in Canadian literary history. His archived papers show evidence that a personally selected anthology was in the works. If it had been carefully edited and published, he may well have gained a better recognition in the Canadian poetic canon. William Pittman Lett is, nevertheless, an important poet in the Canadian Victorian tradition, \\"blogging\\" in verse the rise of Bytown to Ottawa and the evolution of the colony to nationhood, all in context of his own tumultuous and eclectic life and the international turmoil of the nineteenth century. He was a true Confederation poet, bridging the 19th century to the poetic innovations of the popularly named Confederation School of poets.

It was Gilbert's 29th novel and the second of three featuring his final set of recurring characters, Luke Pagan and Joe Narrabone. Set near the beginning of World War I, it has, along with its fictional characters and situations, references to actual events of the time, and a number of actual historical personages also play roles in the book. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Plot Unusually for Gilbert, only about one third of the book's events take place in his usual locale of London. The book, which is really three related stories around a single theme, is set first in the great British naval base of Portsmouth, then in London, and then for the final third in war-torn France. Luke Pagan, formerly a London policeman and now a young recruit in MO5, the new intelligence service headed by Vernon Kell, is an undercover agent posing as a waiter in a Portsmouth hotel. Elements of the German fleet are in port, and he hopes to gain information about German plans for what most observers believe to be an impending war. His old friend Joe Narrabone, also a former London policeman, has been sent to Portsmouth to assist him. In his guise as a waiter, Luke encounters Erich Krieger, a wily and ruthless German saboteur-intelligence agent now passing as a haughty British major residing in Portsmouth. Pagan and Narrabone unravel the details of Krieger's ingenious espionage, but Krieger escapes before he can be arrested. The second part of the book shifts to London, where Krieger has assumed another identity in the first days of the war and is contributing to the deadly sabotage of British warships. With help from Vernon Kell and Admiral William (Blinker) Hall, soon to be the real-life head of Naval Intelligence, they once again thwart some of Krieger's schemes, rounding up a number of German agents in the process. But, as before, Krieger succeeds in escaping. On the assumption that Krieger is still posing as an English officer, but now in France somewhere near the front lines, Luke and Joe are sent to an important transit camp for British troops near the coastal resort of Le Touquet in northern France to continue their pursuit. Working with both British officers and French villagers and fishermen, Pagan and Narrabone use their usual unorthodox methods to eventually track down Krieger in a series of caverns, where he is leading a sizeable group of British deserters. With lethal help from a vengeful French teenager, they bring their hunt, and the book, to an explosive conclusion.

Located on the corner of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street, the Chicago- style building was originally home to the flagship E.M. Scarbrough & Sons department store. The building was the first steel-framed high-rise in Austin. In 1931, a renovation introduced Art Deco elements to the building; the renovation also made Scarbrough's the first retailer to have air conditioning (‚Äúmanufactured weather‚Äù) west of the Mississippi River. The building was named a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 2001.12733 History The building was originally built starting in 1908 by Emerson Monroe Scarbrough, Sr., a former Confederate soldier, to house the flagship location for E.M. Scarbrough & Sons department store, which was known as Scarbrough's by locals. The store originally opened in 1874 in Rockdale, Texas under the name Scarbrough & Hicks. In 1893 Scarbrough left R.H. Hicks in charge of the store and moved with his family to Austin, expanding the business to a new location in the Kreisle Building at the 400 block of Congress Avenue. In 1905, Scarbrough hired architects Sanguinet & Staats to design a new building for the department store. When the new building was completed in 1909, it was the tallest in the state, but George W. Littlefield added a ninth story to his new building to steal the title a year later. In an era where goods were bargained, Scarbrough's was a pioneer in price tagging every item in the store. E.M. Scarbrough bought out and renamed the business with his sons, J. William and Lemuel Scarbrough, in 1913. In 1931, the Scarbrough sons hired architects Wyatt C. Hedrick and Edwin C. Kreisle for a renovation of the building. The Scarbrough Building was completely remodeled in an Art Deco facade, with shop windows widened from 6 ft. (2 m). In its heyday, the department store occupied 95,000 sq. ft. (8,800 m2) spanning three stories, including 10 departments on the ground floor alone. Growth after World War II would redefine shopping habits among the city's new residents. In the 1970s, a branch store was opened at Highland Mall. In 1981, a Scarbrough's store opened as an anchor at Barton Creek Square. The struggling downtown store closed its doors in 1982 after dismal Christmas season sales. The last remaining Scarbrough's store, located on North Lamar Boulevard, closed its doors in December 2009. After Scarbrough's department store closed, the building's ground floor and basement were home to numerous retail stores, including Brooks Brothers and Gold's Gym. In 2019, it was announced that Punch Bowl Social, an entertainment venue, signed a lease for the ground floor and basement level of the building.

Stories =\\"My Work Is Not Yet Done\\"= Constantly afraid, Frank Dominio is a junior manager in a company which doesn't respect him. He's routinely called to meetings by what he calls \\"The Seven\\": seven other managers led by Richard, nicknamed \\"The Doctor\\" for dark and mysterious reasons that an employee could lose their job for enquiring about. Richard calls Dominio \\"Domino\\" in what the latter believes is a deliberate mistake made as a power play. The other managers are Barry, Harry, Mary, Perry, Sherry, and Kerrie, their similarities of name leading Dominio to think of them, Richard aside, as the Seven Dwarves. When Dominio proposes a new product idea which could bring in a great deal of money, The Seven conspire to have him demoted then fired so they can steal it for themselves. A depressed Dominio visits a gun shop, planning to return to the company the next day and kill them one by one.

He was ordained December 27, 1742 as pastor of the Hopewell Church at Big Spring in Newville, the Rocky Spring Presbyterian Church in Letterkenny, and at Middle Spring Presbyterian Church in Southampton Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania until December 1748. The towns and churches were abandoned due to Indian conflict during the Indian Wars. He then moved to Londonderry Township where his brother, Samuel Blair had founded the Faggs Manor Presbyterian church and associated classical school. He remained there after his brother's 1751 death and became pastor, and head of the school, until 1767. He then moved to Princeton, New Jersey where the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) was located to accept a position of Professor of Theology that was funded by a bequeath of Rev Samuel Finley who died in 1767. He was also appointed Trustee, Vice-President, and acting president until appointed President John Witherspoon was able to arrive. As the funds to support the Professorship were insufficient, and Witherspoon was able to teach and lead the college, it was agreed that Blair would resign as Professor. He then agreed to be pastor at the Good Will Church in Wallkill, New York where he remained until his death in 1771. He was buried at the cemetery of the church. Personal Blair was married to Elizabeth (Susan) Durburrow, a daughter of Philadelphia merchant John Durburrow. They had sons John Durburrow Blair (1759‚Äì1823) a 1775 Princeton graduate and theologian, and William Lawrence, a Princeton graduate and Kentucky lawyer, and daughter Rebecca who married William Linn.

Facts Daniel Gerber, the owner of a Grade II* listed building called Gifford Hall at Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, claimed that a nearby proposed solar farm should not have been given planning permission. The 22 hectare site (220,000 m2) was agricultural land. Gerber did not become aware of the plan till work started in March 2014; the work was completed in June 2014. Gerber applied for judicial review in October 2014. Dismantling and restoring the land would have required ¬£1.5m in expense, losing ¬£10.5m in total. Gerber claimed he had a legitimate expectation of notification from the council‚Äôs own Statement of Community Involvement. Dove J in the High Court quashed planning permission.[2015] EWHC 524 (Admin), [2015] Env LR 33 The owner was entitled to claim despite delay under CPR Pt 54 and the Senior Courts Act 1981 section 31(6). Judgment Sales LJ held that the Statement of Community Involvement contained no promise, and generated no legitimate expectation, that a neighbour would be consulted. This error can affect exercise of discretion to extend time to bring a claim. It was inappropriate to extend time for bringing a legal challenge simply because an objector did not notice what was happening, or because of reliance on incorrect legal advice, Finn-Kelcey v Milton Keynes BC.[2008] EWCA Civ 1067 Even if time were extended, major financial detriment would have been suffered by the companies and less harm to the householder‚Äôs amenity. The balance of factors affecting good administration, including the importance of renewable energy in the national interest, and the need for certainty and finality, meant the order quashing the planning permission had to be set aside.

She participated in the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture creating the post office mural for Newton, Mississippi, and a collection of her watercolors was held at the Carville Marine Hospital. Early life Mary Ross was born on July 3, 1920, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont to Dorothy (n√©e Ashley) and Ralph Ross. She was the granddaughter of Dr. George H. Ashley of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Boggs studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Career Prior to her marriage, Ross had begun working as one of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) artists and had won a commission. She married Franklin Boggs on December 21, 1940, in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, and the couple subsequently had four children. In 1941, she and Franklin, who were living in Knoxville, Tennessee, won the competition to complete \\"Economic Life in Newton in the Early 1940s\\" for the post office mural in Newton, Mississippi. The painting was completed as an oil on canvas and then applied to the post office wall. That same year, her watercolor \\"Children's Sunday\\" was selected for an exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art. After the WPA program ended, the couple moved to Wisconsin, where by 1958, Franklin was the chair of the Art department at Beloit College. The Wright Museum of Art there houses her Judy and Summer (1951). Boggs taught art classes for the Beloit Art League and traveled extensively throughout Argentina and Mexico. She exhibited works in Philadelphia, Beloit, Milwaukee, Knoxville and Washington D.C. A collection of Bogg's watercolors were held by the Carville Marine Hospital in Carville, Louisiana, and she had works held in private collections. Boggs divorced Franklin in 1958 and later married Hugh Townley, who had left Beloit for Boston University. She changed her professional name to Mary Ross Townley and began publishing art textbooks. A review of Another Look!, a 1978 curriculum- kit of art textbooks for younger children and their teachers, gives some insight into Mary Ross Townley's concern with imparting the fundamentals of art and the development of visual awareness by a structured, sequenced programme of work, building on itself. In 1989, when her husband retired from Brown University, they moved to Bethel, Vermont. Death and legacy Townley died on June 4, 2002, in Bethel, Vermont.

Not much is known about the Southern California legless lizard as a separate species, with most observations conducted while it was not recognised as separate from Anniella pulchra. Etymology The specific name stebbinsi honors Robert C. Stebbins, an American herpetologist.  Description  The Southern California legless lizard is small and slender, with no legs, a shovel-shaped snout, smooth shiny scales, and a blunt tail. On close observation, eyelids are also present, making clear that the species are lizards and not snakes. Its dorsum is light olive-brown, with strong yellow sides, and its ventral colour is moderate yellow. It also has a black mid-dorsal stripe with the length of less than one scale wide that stretches from the parietals to the tip of the tail, and multiple black stripes that are one scale wide from the eye to the tip of the tail. The holotype is adult female measuring in snout‚Äìvent length with regenerated tail.  Distribution  This species is found in southern California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico).  Habitat and conservation  The Southern California legless lizard is found in a wider range of habitat than any other species in the genus, mostly found in coastal sand dunes and a variety of interior habitats, including sandy washes and alluvial fans. They live mostly underground, burrowing in the loose, sandy soil. However, much of the coastal dune habitat has been destroyed by coastal development between Ventura County and the Mexican Border. However, a large protected population persists in the remnant of the once extensive El Segundo Dunes at the Los Angeles International Airport. As of March 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not assessed this species for the IUCN Red List.

One of New York's last remaining Yiddish theatre buildings, it is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally named the Louis N. Jaffe Theater (also called the Yiddish Art Theatre (after its first tenant) and later the Yiddish Folks Theatre), the structure was built in 1925-26 by Louis Jaffe, a developer and prominent Jewish community leader, at 12th Street and Second Avenue in the Yiddish Theatre District. Jaffe built the theatre to house Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theatre, which Schwartz had founded 1918 to present serious Yiddish drama and works from world literature in Yiddish. The theatre was designed in the Moorish Revival style by Harrison Wiseman; William Pogany consulted on the interior design. The design incorporated Moorish motifs with Judaic references (Yiddish writing outside the lobby and a large Star of David in the ornate dome remain to attest to the building's origins). In his new theatre, Schwartz continued to produce shows, including a production of \\"Yoshe Kalb\\" which ran for 300 performances. According to legend, Walter Matthau briefly worked at the theatre's concession stand as a youth. The Yiddish Arts Theatre continued at least into 1936, but by the late 1930s the building was a movie theatre, the Century Theatre. It closed for a while in the 1940s, reopening as a 1,082-seat movie theatre, the Stuyvesant Theatre. Around 1953 Norris Houghton and Edward Hambleton bought the theatre (which was then closed) and renamed it the Phoenix Theatre. The Phoenix Theatre was a pioneering project in the development of off-Broadway, with a different approach to legitimate theatre than found on Broadway. The first production was Sidney Howard's play \\"Madam, Will You Walk?\\", which opened on December 1, 1953, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy; later that season Montgomery Clift starred in The Seagull. In the following years, the Phoenix Theatre mounted more productions featuring notable figures of the theatre both on stage and behind it. The Phoenix Theatre moved to a new location in 1961. Ann Corio then mounted her successful nostalgic review This Was Burlesque at the theatre, beginning in 1962. Corio later took her show on the road. From 1965 to 1969, the building was the Gayety Theatre, a more raunchy burlesque house, and the only one in Manhattan at that time. The Gayety Theatre was used for the interior theatre shots in the film The Night They Raided Minsky's. After this, the theatre operated as the Eden Theatre and hosted off-Broadway shows, including Grease and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat before those musicals went on to Broadway, and the controversial Oh! Calcutta!. From 1978 to 1984 the theatre operated as the Entermedia Theater. In 1991 the theatre (which was no longer in use) was converted back to a movie theatre, the Village East Cinema (owned by City Cinemas, a branch of Reading International), which shows a mixture of Hollywood productions and indie films. The main auditorium seats 1,200, and there are four small screening rooms in the basement, each seating under 200 people, and two other screens in the former backstage area. The Village East Cinema also shows films which originally opened at the Angelika Film Center, an arthouse chain which is also an arm of Reading International. The theatre was extensively renovated and restored in 2015.

The village is located 9km north of the city of Jenin, south of the West Bank separation barrier and according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 2016 it had a population of 1,007. Prehistoric flint tools from the Upper and Middle Paleolithic period were found south of the village. Archaeological remains from the Byzantine era were found in the village. It is offered as the location of settlement called \\"Araba\\", mentioned by Eusebius in the 4th century CE. Geography Arabbuna is located 3 km northwest of Faqqua and 2 km northeast of Deir Ghazaleh. The village houses are situated on a hill at the foot of Mount Faqqua, a section of Mount Gilboa (known as Mount Gibborim in Hebrew), bordered on the west by the Huhit river, on the west by Wadi Abu Jabir, on the north by Mount Faqqua and on the south by a rivulet of Wadi Abi Jabir.Hareuveni, Immanuel; Eretz Yisrael Lexicon; Ministry of Education p.781 History = Archeology = Archeologists have found flint tools south of Arabbuna. These tools dated to the Upper Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic periods (300,000 to 10,000 years BP). The tools from the former belong to the Mousterian culture. The village itself is situated on an ancient site. Old stones have been reused in buildings, fences and walls of terraces. Rock cuttings are scattered between houses and orchards. Some of these are identified as ancient tombs. Today the residents of Arabbuna use these rock cuttings for storage. A small amount of potsherds and glassware were found in the village and are dated to the Byzantine era.

He attended the University of Utah and UCLA. While in college, he sold encyclopedias. Book distribution and publishing business in Japan A romance with a Japanese woman led him to visit Japan. He stayed 13 years, establishing a book distribution company that sold English language encyclopedias, engineering books and art books. His company also published translations of books into Japanese. Shrem sold his Japanese business after 13 years. At that time, it had 50 offices and 2,000 salespeople. He met Mitsuko Shrem in 1960; they married and had two sons, Marc and David. They were married until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2010. Business ventures in Europe After selling his Japanese company, Shrem lived with his family in Italy and France, where he continued with publishing and book distribution ventures. There, he began collecting art and learning about wine. He studied enology at the University of Bordeaux. Clos Pegase Winery Clos Pegase Winery After retiring from the publishing business, Shrem relocated to the Napa Valley, where he established Clos Pegase Winery in 1983. In cooperation with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, he conducted an architectural design competition for a winery building. Out of 96 entries, the winner was Michael Graves, who would design the postmodern Clos Pegase Winery building, which opened in 1987. In the Washington Post in 1988, James Conaway said that \\"Clos Pegase is our first monument to wine as art.\\" It was later described by architecture critic Susan Dinkelspiel Cerny as \\"an interpretation of Classicism in ochre and burnt sienna, with a spare desert feeling.\\" Shrem is well known for delivering a humorous lecture on the 4000 year history of wine as seen through art. He calls his presentation \\"Bacchus the Rascal: A Bacchanalian History of Wine Seen Through 4000 Years of Art\\". Shrem married Maria Manetti Farrow in 2012. He sold Clos Pegase to Leslie Rudd's Vintage Wine Estates in 2013, when he was 83 years old.

In 1981, Shull was named to the 17th class of White House Fellows and served in the Office of the Chief of Staff. During his last active-duty assignment, then-Major Shull served as Military Assistant to Robert ‚ÄúBud‚Äù McFarlane, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. During his time at the White House, Shull led a major re-evaluation and revision of White House management systems.

Shull represented the White House in helping to oversee the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He earned the Defense Superior Service Medal.  Business career  Shull began his retail career in 1985 at Sanger-Harris, formed by Federated Department Stores, in Dallas, Texas, where he led business planning, training and recruiting. He served as Divisional Merchandise Manager of $20 million hard good businesses for the prominent regional 22-store chain. From 1986 to 1990, Shull served as senior consultant at McKinsey & Co., where he directed defense/aerospace and retail client engagements to reduce costs and increase market share.

The Exchange is responsible for more than 2,500 facilities in 33 countries, 50 states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa) and the District of Columbia. In 2012, Shull was named the Director/CEO of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service, becoming the first civilian to lead the Department of Defense retailer. Shull‚Äôs business acumen and passion for taking care of military families have been the foundation to keeping the Exchange benefit thriving for America‚Äôs Warfighters and their families. When he came aboard, Shull applied private-sector best practices to the Exchange and focused on growth initiatives such as intensifying national brands, growing concessions and its convenience stores, transforming the online experience. The Exchange is a nonappropriated fund entity of the Department of Defense operating more than 4,000 retail facilities in more than 30 countries. Like commercial retailers, the Exchange is reliant on the sale of products and services to fund its operations and generate a profit. In 2015, the Exchange achieved more than $400 million in earnings, despite military personnel downsizing of 13 percent since 2011. This performance represents an increase of three percentage points in terms of profitability, and is on par with or exceeds that of Walmart and Target. Record operating earnings in 2015 allowed the Exchange to distribute $237.2 million in dividends to military Quality-of-Life Programs. Each year, the Exchange distributes two-thirds of its earnings to these programs. In 2016, Shull became the longest-serving leader of the Exchange. Under Shull's leadership, the Exchange has more closely aligned itself with private-sector competitors by tightening cost controls, reducing its number of employees, and introducing top brands such as Disney and Michael Kors. The Exchange has also improved its E-commerce operation at ShopMyExchange.com, establishing shipping centers inside brick-and-mortar stores to reduce shipping costs and increase delivery speeds. In 2019, the Exchange continued to perform well, reporting $369 million in earnings, $217 million of which was reinvested into installation Quality-of-Life programs that promote military readiness and resiliency, including child, youth and school services; Armed Forces Recreation Centers; and more.

He also helped lead the first major Capital Campaign in USMA history. Shull is former Chairman and member of the Board of Directors, Deafness Research Foundation, the largest private charity for funding research in the causes and treatment of hearing loss.  Veterans advocacy  thumb Tom Shull (second from left) with (left to right) Michael Zacharia, Ambassador Robert \\"Bud\\" McFarlane, Lewis Shull, \\"To Heal a Nation\\" author Jan Scruggs and LTC John Shull. Shull is a lifelong advocate for veterans' issues. While serving as a White House Fellow assigned to the White House, Shull was chosen to be an intermediary during the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, helping to ensure compromises were reached to facilitate the construction and dedication of the memorial. In a Harvard Business School Bulletin article \\"Making Peace,\\" Jack Wheeler (a driving force in getting the Memorial built on the National Mall) said, \\"There would have been no memorial without Tom Shull. Period.\\" Once Shull came to the Exchange, he began planning for a way to recognize and honor all honorably discharged veterans for their service. In a 2014 memo to the Undersecretary of Defense, Shull proposed allowing all honorably discharged veterans to shop the exchanges online as a modest recognition of their service, especially since the vast majority of veterans who served honorably do not meet the 20-year criteria or certified 100% disabled by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to retain exchange benefits. The Veterans online shopping benefit represents a low-risk, low-cost opportunity to strengthen funding of Quality-of-Life programs in support of service members‚Äô and their families. On Jan. 11, 2017, after years of coordination with the Exchange, Departments of Defense, Army and Air Force as well as several other federal agencies, Shull received word that a change to DoD policy would extend limited online exchange privileges to all honorably discharged veterans starting Nov. 11, 2017‚ÄîVeterans Day. Congressional oversight committees were notified as well and had 30 days to comment. No comments were provided, and the Veterans online shopping benefit‚Äîthe first new benefit for Veterans since 1953‚Äîbegan on Veterans Day 2017. The Veterans online shopping benefit allows approximately 15 million veterans to shop online at military exchanges. As of June 2019, nearly 90,000 Veterans saved more than $5 million in sales tax . The initiative is projected to add approximately $200 million in sales to the Exchange's annual revenue within three years, making the Exchange more competitive with private-sector competitors such as Amazon.com and offsetting a 13 percent decline in the number of active-duty Soldiers and Airmen since 2011. On Jan. 1, 2020, the Exchange welcomed home disabled Veterans, Purple Heart recipients and certain caregivers‚Äî4.1 million Americans‚Äî with in-store shopping privileges. Privileges expanded to all Veterans with service-connected disabilities, Veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, Veterans who are former prisoners of war and primary family caregivers for Veterans who are enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Before the expansion, only Veterans with 100% service-connected disabilities could shop in person. (Active-duty service members, their dependents and military retirees also have in-store and online privileges.)  Awards and Decorations  Mr. Shull's awards and decorations include: * Presidential Service Badge * Meritorious Service Medal (United States) * Expert Infantryman‚Äôs Badge * Ranger Tab * Airborne Wings * Defense Superior Service Medal. * Reserve Officer's Association's Minuteman Hall of Fame * American Logistics Association Distinguished Service Award  Personal life  Shull and his wife, Dorothy, reside in Dallas, TX.

Natural environment  Polna is located at the border between Ro≈ºnow-Ciƒô≈ºkowice Foothill and Low Beskid mountain range. From the hills of Polna a vast panorama can be seen.

Education  There is a primary education school in Polna: http://szppolna.republika.pl  Historical architecture  =The Church of St Andrew the Apostle, Polna= The history of Polna parish dates back to the second half of the 14th century. The Church of St. Andrew the Apostle was erected in place of the older temple which was founded in 1297 by Ritter Wizlans of Melsztyn, as mentioned by the 15th century chronicler, Jan Dlugosz, in his work \\"Liber beneficiorum\\". The construction of the present church took place in the 16th century. The church is in the late Gothic style; there is one main nave with a chancel and an apse, ending with a three-sided tower. In 1820 the church was significantly rebuilt, thanks to the efforts of the owner of the village, Tekla Stadnicka, and the front of the nave from the west was extended. Following this, in 1901 a new bell tower was built, in 1910 the rectory building was added, and between 1920 and 1939, the new farm buildings were constructed. In the years 2001‚Äì2010 numerous conservation work was carried out, including the restoration of the historic murals in the chancel. The polychrome interior (murals) of the church is worth special attention. This is a multi-coloured painted decoration, consisting of several layers. The oldest layer covers the walls around the main altar and the nave. It dates back to 1595‚Äì1607 and was most likely founded by Nicholas and Elizabeth of G≈Çadysz. It shows a series of 29 scenes devoted to the life and passion of Christ. On the southern wall can be seen the emblems of the founders (the Griffin and Trumpet signs). Over the door to the side porch is the scene of the decapitation of St. John the Baptist. The remaining surface of the walls of the nave is decorated by a newer layer - paintings dating back to the second half of the 17th century. The newest layer shows scenes of the Last Judgment and the figures of St. Peter and St. Paul. Historic murals were discovered during the restoration work carried out between 1965 and 1966. A year later the image of Our Lady Help of Christians of the late 16th century was discovered. Currently it is located on the main altar. The Baroque side altars from the late 18th century are noteworthy as well. On the left one is a mid-18th century image of St. Margaret and next to it - the 18th century pulpit. The oldest pieces in the church are the font and stoup of the 16th century. It is worth mentioning that between 1882 and 1883 the blessed Jan Balicki was working in Polna parish. On 18 August 2002 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II. An image commemorating him is located in the northern part of the church. This church is included as one of the 251 objects on the Wooden Architecture Trail in the province of Ma≈Çopolska [Lesser Poland], Southern Poland.

The situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) was proposed by Jeong-Nam Kim and James E. Grunig in 2011 though their article ‚Äúproblem solving and communicative action: A situational theory of problem solving.‚Äù The theory was developed from the situational theory of publics (STP) and claimed it is ‚Äúan extended and generalized version‚Äù of STP. This theory has an assumption that ‚Äúthe more one commits to problem resolution, the more one becomes acquisitive of information pertaining to the problem, selective in dealing with information, and transmissive in giving it to others.‚Äù  History  = Extension from situational theory of publics = STP has been heavily used in the field of public relations to understand why and how publics communicate. The original situational theory uses three independent variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition) to predict the dependent variable of information seeking and processing. STOPS was proposed to overcome four limitations of STP: # STP considered only information acquisition as a concept of active communication behaviors # The predictive power of referent criterion variable has been unclear throughout the development of STP # Only few antecedents of communication behavior were considered # STP was underutilized because of the narrow concept of information behaviors Alterations in existed variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and reference criterion) were done to explain communicative action in problem solving variable. STOPS also expanded the focus of the theory from \\"decisions\\" to a more general concept of life \\"problems.\\" A new variable, situational motivation in problem solving, was added to mediate the effects of predictive variables of communicative behavior.  Concepts of key variables  = Situational antecedents: perceptual and cognitive frame in problem solving = * Problem Recognition: ‚Äúone‚Äôs perception that something is missing and that there is no immediately applicable solution to it.‚Äù * Constraint Recognition: perceived obstacles in a problem-solving task that reduce one's ability to do anything about the issue. Constraint recognition limit one's communication behaviors even when he or she has high problem recognition and/or involvement recognition. * Involvement Recognition: ‚Äúa perceived connection between the self and the problem situation.‚Äù This variable has the same concept of the level of involvement in the situational theory of publics. * Referent Criterion: ‚Äúany knowledge or subjective judgmental system that influences the way in which one approaches problem solving.‚Äù = Situational motivation in problem solving = The extent to which an individual wants to know more about a problem. This concept mediates the effect of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition. Referent criterion would be independent of this variable because it is more cognitive than perceptual. = Communicative behavior in problem solving = When an individual tries to solve a problem, his or her communicative activeness increases in three domains of communication action: information acquisition, selection, and transmission.  Information acquisition  The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of information searching for problem solving. * Information seeking (active): a planned perusing of messages about a specific topic. * Information attending (passive): an unplanned exposure for messages about a specific topic.  Information selection  The communicative action that is relevant to the extent of an individual's directedness in acquiring and sharing information. * Information forefending (active): ‚Äúthe extent to which a communicator fends off certain information in advance by judging its value and relevance for a given problem-solving task.‚Äù Individuals with higher information forefending look for more specific, systematic, and accurate information. * Information permitting (passive): the extent to which an individual accept any information related to a problem-solving task.  Information transmission  The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of educating others to utilize collective behaviors for problem solving. * Information forwarding (active): forwarding information even if no one requests for one's opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem. * Information sharing (passive): sharing of information only when other person asks for one's opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.  Model  An individual's perception toward a problematic life situation, motivation to solve the problem, and activation of cognitive frames influence an individual's activeness in six information behaviors ‚Äì information forefending, information permitting, information forwarding, information sharing, information seeking, and information attending. Model of Situational Theory of Problem Solving  Applications of the theory  STOPS has more than 200 research bibliographies in academic databases such as Communication & Mass Media Complete, Business Source Premier, and Academic Search Premier. Some of the applications of this theory are in the fields of health communication, crisis communication, organizational communication, and nonprofit communication.

Players use the rifle-shaped light guns to fire at clay pigeons, represented as flying white dots on a projector screen. There are two that must be shot down in each round, and players only get two bullets to hit them. Bonus points are awarded for shooting the pigeons as soon as they appear, or by destroying both of them with a single bullet. Gameplay Shoot Away is a lightgun shooter arcade game that simulates the sport of skeet shooting. It uses a projector system that projects monochrome images against a panoramic backdrop, designed to resemble a forest clearing. Using the attached lightguns, players have two attempts to shoot at both white targets ‚Äî representing clay pigeons ‚Äî that arch across the screen. Both players' scores are shown on an LCD display attached to the gun holsters. There are two difficulty options, \\"Regular\\" and \\"Pro\\". Development and release Development of Shoot Away was done by Sho Osugi, an engineer for Namco that worked on many of the company's driving games for arcades. He was assisted by Kazunori Sawano, best known for his work on Namco's first major hit Galaxian. Shoot Away was one of Namco's first products exported outside Japan, helping establish intercontinental connections with other manufacturers. Reception and legacy Shoot Away was Namco's first major arcade hit, and performed considerably well in the United States. Satish Bhutani, the co-founder of Namco America, had difficulty in satisfying the growing demand for the game. Shoot Away remained a popular title in arcades well after its original release, with machines still being sold as late as 1986. Cash Box was enamored with the game's sense of realism, particularly its rifle-shaped lightguns and illuminated projector backdrop. They wrote that it provides \\"a very appealing atmosphere for the player\\". Electronic Fun with Computer & Games shared their admiration for its large, vibrant projector screen. In a 1991 retrospective article on electro- mechanical arcade games, CU Amiga writer Julian Rignall ranked Shoot Away as one of the \\"real interactive games\\". In 1978, Namco released a variation of Shoot Away named Clay Champ. It was designed to be smaller and more compact for arcades and other street locations, and used mirror effects combined with projection systems. Allied Leisure released the game in North America in June 1979. In the same year, Allied released a video version titled Clay Shoot. Namco released CosmoSwat in 1984, which was a reskin of Shoot Away that featured a science fiction-motif and a video display on the gun holster stand. A 1992 sequel, Shoot Away II, was published in Japan, featuring additional difficulties and new fiber optic lightguns. A version that featured rapid-fire lightguns was also produced. Shoot Away II is included as a minigame in Time Crisis II (2001) and Point Blank DS (2006). Namco released a version of Shoot Away for Japanese cellular phones in 2002 through the i-Mode network. A third sequel, Shoot Away Pro, was developed by Bandai Namco Amusement and released in March 2018.

In geometry, two triangles are said to be 5-Con or almost congruent if they are not congruent triangles but they are similar triangles and share two side lengths (of non- corresponding sides). The 5-Con triangles are important examples for understanding the solution of triangles. Indeed, knowing three angles and two sides (but not their sequence) is not enough to determine a triangle up to congruence. A triangle is said to be 5-Con capable if there is another triangle which is almost congruent to it. The 5-Con triangles have been discussed by Pawley:, and later by Jones and Peterson. They are briefly mentioned by Martin Gardner in his book Mathematical Circus. Another reference is the following exercise > Explain how two triangles can have five parts (sides, angles) of one > triangle congruent to five parts of the other triangle, but _not_ be > congruent triangles. A similar exercise dates back to 1955, and there an earlier reference is mentioned. It is however not possible to date the first occurrence of such standard exercises about triangles. Examples There are infinitely many pairs of 5-Con triangles, even up to scaling. * The smallest 5-Con triangles with integer sides have side lengths (8; 12; 18) and (12; 18; 27). This is an example with obtuse triangles. * An example of acute 5-Con triangles is (1000; 1100; 1210) and (1100; 1210; 1331). * The 5-Con right triangles are exactly those obtained from scaling the pair (1;m;m^2) and (m; m^2; m^3) with m=sqrt{frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}}=sqrt{phi} where œÜ is the golden ratio. Consequently, these are Kepler triangles and there can be no right 5-Con triangles with integer sides. * There are no 5-Con triangles that are equilateral or isosceles because that would require m = 1 and the 5-Con triangles would be congruent. * There are no integer 5-Con triangles that are Heronian because the sides of integer 5-Con triangles are in a geometric progression. Results 1. Consider 5-Con triangles with side lengths (a;b;c) and (ma;mb;mc) where m is the scaling factor, which we may suppose to be greater than 1. We may also suppose aleq bleq c. Then we must have b=ma and c=mb. The two triples of side lengths are then of the form: a(1;m;m^2)qquad mathrm{and} qquad a(m;m^2;m^3).Conversely, for any a>0 and 1, such triples are the side lengths for 5-Con triangles. (Supposing without loss of generality that a=1, the greatest number in the first triple is m^2 and we only need to ensure m^2<1+m; the second triple is obtained from the first by scaling with m. So we have two triangles: They are clearly similar and exactly two of the three side lengths coincide.) Some references work with m^{-1}<1 instead, which leads to the inequalities frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}. 2. Any 5-Con capable triangle has different side lengths and the middle one is the geometric mean of the other two. The ratio between the largest and the middle side length is then equal to that between the middle and the smallest side length. We can use both this ratio and its inverse for scaling and obtaining an almost congruent triangle. 5-Con triangles with the same greatest side. 3. To study the possible shapes of 5-Con triangles, we may restrict to studying the triangles with side lengths (1;m;m^2)qquad mathrm{where} qquad 1The greatest angle is a strictly increasing continuous function of m and varies from 60¬∞ to 180¬∞ (the limit cases are excluded). The right triangle corresponds to the value m=sqrt{frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}}. For convenience, scale the triangle to obtain (m^{-2};m^{-1};1), so that the largest side is fixed: The opposite vertex then moves along a curve as m is varied, as shown in the figure. 4. Having two 5-Con triangles with integral sides amounts (in the above notation) to taking any rational number 1 and then choosing a>0 in such a way that am^3is an integer. The four involved integral side lengths (a;am;am^2;am^3) do not share any common factor (the 4-tuple is then called primitive) if and only if they are of the form (x^3;x^2y;xy^2;y^3)where x,y are coprime positive integers. Further remarks Two 7-Con quadrilaterals. Defining almost congruent triangles gives a binary relation on the set of triangles. This relation is clearly not reflexive, but it is symmetric. It is not transitive: As a counterexample, consider the three triangles with side lengths (8;12;18), (12;18;27), and (18;27;40.5). There are infinite sequences of triangles such that any two subsequent terms are 5-Con triangles. It is easy to construct such a sequence from any 5-Con capable triangle: To get an ascending (respectively, descending) sequence, keep the two greatest (respectively, smallest) side lengths and simply choose a third greater (respectively, smaller) side length to obtain a similar triangle. One may easily arrange the triangles in the sequence in a neat way, for example in a spiral. One generalization is considering 7-Con quadrilaterals, i.e. non- congruent (and not necessarily similar) quadrilaterals where four angles and three sides coincide or, more generally, (2n-1)-Con n-gons.

It is a common spider orchid, especially after winter rains, occurring in a restricted area. It has a single hairy leaf and one or two creamy-coloured flowers. It was formerly included with Caladenia incensa.  Description  Caladenia pluvialis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which sometimes forms small clumps. It has a single erect leaf, long, wide and pale green. One or two dull cream to creamy-yellow flowers across are borne on a stalk high. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base then narrow to a reddish-black, thread-like glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect to slightly curved forward, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread horizontally near the base, then curve downwards. The petals are long and wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long and wide and cream coloured with red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have short, broad, forward-facing serrations, its tip is curled under and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli up to long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early September and is encouraged by good winter rainfall.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia pluvialis was first described in 2015 by Andrew Phillip Brown and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected near Mullewa and the description was published in Nuytsia.

These property taxes are called rates. They are assessed annually and usually paid in four equal instalments. Introduction New Zealand no longer has land taxes per se. Formerly, NZ did have land taxes - its first ever direct tax, enacted in 1878, was a land tax (levied at a rate of one halfpenny per pound of unimproved land value). But the contribution of land taxes to the government steadily reduced and by 1967 represented a mere 0.5% of total government revenues. In 1982 it was observed that only 5% of all land was taxed (the rest was exempted under one of an increasing list of exemptions), and so in 1990, land tax was repealed.See this Wikipedia entry for a short history of NZ's Land Tax. Instead, it has property taxes related to land. This might seem like a distinction in search of a meaning, and in simplest terms a property tax is more flexible than a land tax, and can be applied to both land and the improvements on the land.For a more detailed discussion on the difference, see, eg, Richard F Dye and Richard W England, ‚ÄòThe Principles and Promises of Land Value Taxation‚Äô in Richard F Dye and Richard W England (eds), Land Value Taxation: Theory, Evidence, and Practice (Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, 2009) 3, 4 n 1 In New Zealand, as in most countries, residents pay income tax, a Goods and Services Tax, and property taxes (as well as assorted other minor taxes and fees). Although property taxes are the least substantial of these three principal forms of taxation, they are generally held to be the most unpopular. They are possibly the most 'obvious', they are the hardest to structure or minimize, and they apply no matter if you are wealthy or poor. Being sensitive to the public dislike of property taxes, and a general feeling of alienation and disenfranchisement from the tax setting and policy process, the NZ Government set about a major rewrite of both the legislation defining how local government bodies were managed (the Local Government Act 2002 ) and the property tax setting process (this Act). Purpose of the Act Section 3 of the Act states its purpose in three points : (a) providing local authorities with flexible powers to set, assess, and collect rates to fund local government activities (b) ensuring that rates are set in accordance with decisions that are made in a transparent and consultative manner (c) providing for processes and information to enable ratepayers to identify and understand their liability for rates. The powers given to local authorities are indeed broad and flexible (as per the first point) which leads to the constraining second point - rates can only be set and collected after going through a formal process of consultation with the public. The third point makes the process even more transparent - it requires a detailed breakdown of the amount being collected in rates each year so that rate payers know exactly what they are funding. Provisions of the Act The Act sets out what types of land can be rated (i.e. taxed), either in full or partially, and what types of land are exempt from local government rates. The Act sets out parameters for how land can be differentiated, and the types of methods and formulas that can be used for assessing rates. It also contains administrative type provisions for how values are calculated and rates are assessed and collected, penalties for late payment, and other special case considerations. =Rateable land= The Act states that all land, unless otherwise excepted, is rateable. In Schedule 1 to the Act it defines 25 categories of land that are non-rateable and also 3 categories of land which are rateable at no more than 50% of the regular rate. Non-rateable land is primarily land that is owned by the national or local government, or owned by a charity and available to the public, and some categories of Maori land. Land that is at least 50% non-rateable is land owned or used by Agricultural and Pastoral Societies as showgrounds, sportgrounds (but not horse or greyhound racetracks) and/or land owned or used by any group for any branch of the arts. Non-rateable land is still liable to pay rates related to water supply, sewage disposal, and/or refuse collection. =Rateable units and SUIPs= Understanding what comprises a single rating unit is important when rates such as a Uniform Annual General Rate (see below) is imposed on each rating unit. The concept of rating unit is defined in the Rating Valuations Act 1998. Generally, each separate certificate of title is considered to be its own rating unit. But if multiple certificates of title are owned by the same person or persons, are used jointly as a single unit, and are either contiguous (i.e. next to each other) or separated only by a road or rail line or body of water, then they can be deemed a single rating unit. So, for example, a farmer with land on four different titles, on both sides of a road that goes through the middle of his property, would most likely have his four titles deemed to be a single rating unit. A second related concept is that of determining a count of Separately Used or Inhabited Parts of a Rating Unit (SUIP). It is possible that one rating unit might have multiple SUIPs on it - for example, a piece of land with three condo/apartments on it. This becomes relevant when general rates such as Uniform Annual General Charges are imposed, not per rating unit, but per SUIP. =Types of rates= The Act defines two main categories of rates - general rates and targeted rates. General rates A general type of rate is usually adopted when the local authority believes the community as a whole should pay for a service, or where there is no good reason or reason to separate the cost out and fund it specifically. General rates apply to all ratepayers within the local authority's jurisdiction. A general rate can be either a Uniform Annual General Charge which applies equally to all ratepayers, or a 'value based' rate which is based on some element of the property's value (either its unimproved (land) value, its combined value of land and improvements, or its annual value). Value based rates can be calculated either on a standard rate per dollar of rateable value, or at different rates for different categories of rating units. The different categories that could be considered are listed in Schedule 2 to the Act. More than one general rate can be imposed. For example, a ratepayer may be levied a UAGC of $200 plus a differential rate of 0.25% of the total property value. Targeted rates Targeted rates are sometimes used where a specific service or benefit is being provided unevenly to some ratepayers but not to others. Targeted rates can also be imposed on all ratepayers, with the monies received being earmarked to fund a specific purpose. An example of a targeted rate might be a 'Central Business District' rate imposed on property in a town's central business district and used to fund specific services in that area. Another example might be a water rate - possibly a flat fee per rating unit that is connected to a central water service, and/or possibly a fee per cubic metre of water provided. A related rate would be a sewage disposal rate, often calculated on the basis of the number of toilet bowls or urinals present in each rating unit. Water and sewage rates can have three 'states' associated with them. If a rating unit does not have that service available, then the first state (i.e. no charge) would apply. If a rating unit has the service available, but the service is not being used, then one level of rate might be imposed, and if the service is available and being used, then a second higher level of rate might be imposed. =Matters and factors= The Act employs confusing terminology when describing the process for setting targeted rates. It helps to see it as a two step process. In Schedule 2, it lists a set of matters - these are considerations that determine which rating units will be liable for, and which rating units will not be liable for a particular rate. In Schedule 3, it lists a set of factors - these are considerations that determine how and what amounts will be payable. There are nine matters that can be considered, for example, where the land is located, or the use to which the land is put. There are twelve factors that can be used in calculating rates, for example, the area of floor space within any buildings on the land or the value of improvements to the rating unit. 30% cap on flat fee rates Because they are felt to be regressive in nature, there is a 30% cap on how much of the total rates revenue can be collected from Uniform Annual General Charges and from targeted rates that are set on a uniform basis, except for uniformly targeted rates that apply for water supply or sewage disposal. =Calculating rateable values= The Act requires properties to be valued at least once every three years. The Rating Valuations Act (1998) covers much of this process, and Part 2 of this Act sets out the record keeping requirements of each local government body. Most local bodies have their rating database available online, and are required to have it available for free public inspection at their principal public office or an alternate appropriate location during regular business hours. Ratepayers can challenge the accuracy of their property valuation or the information held about their property. =Setting rates= The process of setting rates seems deceptively simply in the Act (section 23) - i.e., being set by a resolution of the local authority. This apparent simplicity is because most of the process is prescribed in section 103 of the Local Government Act 2002. It requires rates to be congruent with the Revenue and Financing Policy in the Long Term Plan, and for each year's rate-setting to be based on the annual plan for the year and its associated Funding Impact Statement. Rate models must be included in the FIS, and if the rate setting process isn't strictly followed, the rates thereby levied may be uncollectable. =Remitting and postponing rates= The Act allows local authorities to remit all or part of the rates on a rating unit if the local authority has established a formal policy allowing itself to do so. The act allows local authorities to postpone all or part of the rates on a rating unit, again if there is an existing formal policy allowing such postponement. The policy may set a fee that applies in such cases, but if a fee is applied, it can not exceed the actual administrative and financial costs involved. These types of waivers need to be formally reviewed at least once every six years by the local authoritySee s.102 of the Local Government Act 2002. There are also income-tested provisions under the Rates Rebate Act (1973) that provides a subsidy to low income homeowners to help them meet the cost of their rates. Problems with the Act The national government's Auditor General audits all local authority annual reports, and several times has prepared specific reports on common issues and concerns that have arisen from its reviews. After the first year of the new Act's operation, the Auditor General reported in 2005 on some inconsistencies to do with how local authorities could reset rates during a rating year, and how they should handle any rate surpluses collected. In 2006, the Auditor General reviewed the specific policies relating to postponement of rates. A formal inquiry, chaired by David Shand and sometimes referred to as the Shand Report, but formally titled 'Funding Local Government' was undertaken in 2006 and reported in 2007. This inquiry noted that in a number of respects, the consultation, planning and accountability practices of local authorities were more advanced than those of central government. Nonetheless, it came up with 96 specific recommendations grouped into eight categories for future improvements. One of the Report's more surprising recommendations was that local authorities should fund more capital works from debt, which it felt was a fair and appropriate way to fund long-term capital benefits, and which could allow for a 10% reduction of current rates. In general, very few of the Report's recommendations have been acted on. In 2014, the Auditor General provided some commentary on their auditing policies and issues uncovered to do with local authority rates. They reported that most local authorities had some problems with rating compliance, and that they uncovered compliance problems with every aspect of the Act's requirements. The report goes on to cite some of the problems uncovered, with the problems generally being failures of procedure or understanding of the Act's requirements, rather than being anything willfully fraudulent. Statistics It is difficult to give accurate time series data for rates revenues, due to the changing nature of local authorities, one-off transactions each year, and the dominating/distortive impact of Auckland. So we are providing some simple headline data here. Between the period 1993-94 and 2006-2007, rates increased by 38% in real terms, i.e., after adjusting for inflation. A report commissioned by the Local Government Association shows that real rates per household have increased by almost 50% between 1993 and 2011. The Department of Internal Affairs published a detailed set of time series and analysis of how rates were imposed in July 2011. In 2009-10, local authorities collected $2.9 billion in rates receipts, being 53% of total operating revenue of $5.5 billion. In 2010-11, local authorities rates receipts made up 54% of total operating revenue. This increased still further to 55% of total operating revenue in 2011-12. Following what seems to be a trend, rates made up 56% of total operating revenue in the 2012-13 year. For the 2013-14 year, although rate revenues increased 4% over the previous year, the percentage of total operating revenue dropped to 54% as a result of some asset revaluations in Auckland. The 2014-15 year showed rates receipts returning to 'normal' trends and totalling 57% of total revenues.

He was treasurer of the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad from 1861 to 1863, and briefly president of the New York Central Railroad in 1866. Early life Henry Keep was born on June 22, 1818, in Adams, New York, to Herman Chandler Keep and his wife, Dorothy ( Kent). He had two sisters, Mary and Martha. He was a descendant of John Keep, and emigrant from the Kingdom of England who arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1660 and was killed in 1676 during King Philip's War. He was also related to William Ezra Keep, a successful builder in Hartford, Connecticut. Keep had no schooling as a child. His father died in 1835 when Keep was just 17. His family was left impoverished and lost their home, so his mother turned herself and her children over to the county poorhouse. The county loaned children out as workers to local businessmen and farmers, if the employer provided a wage or some other means of improvement to the child. Keep was sent to work for Joseph Grammon, a local farmer who promised to send the boy to public school. Grammon failed to keep his word, beat the Henry mercilessly, and barely fed him. With $1.50 ($ in dollars) and a coat given to him by a friend, Keep ran away. Grammon later offered a reward of two cents for his return. Keep settled in Honeoye Falls, New York, where he got a job as a teamster on the Erie Canal, and later found a position as a hack driver in nearby Rochester, New York. Financier and railroad baron =Currency speculation= During the Panic of 1837, Keep would buy purchased depreciated Watertown banknotes in Rochester, then travel to Watertown (where the notes were worth more) and cash them for a profit. He quickly quadrupled his net worth. He then invested in notes issued by the state, which were trading at a discount due to the economic recession. He then began traveling around upstate New York, where he would approach people carrying Canadian banknotes. These were worthless in the United States, so Keep would exchange his state notes for the Canadian banknotes (at yet another heavy discount). When he had enough Canadian banknotes in hand, Keep would travel to Canada and cash the banknotes at par. He made $500 to $1,000 a week ($ to $ in dollars) a week in these exchanges. =Banking= On September 28, 1847, Keep established Henry Keep's Bank in Watertown, New York. Some time in 1850, Keep opened the Frontier Bank in Watertown. On August 1, 1850, Keep opened the Citizens' Bank in Watertown, and in 1852 opened a branch of this bank in Fulton, New York. On September 17, 1851, he opened the Mechanic's Bank in Watertown, and later invested in the Union Bank of Watertown. Keep proved so successful at banking that he moved to New York City in 1850, and began investment banking operations on Wall Street. =Railroading= Just prior to the American Civil War, railroad stocks were worth about a nickel each. Keep invested heavily in railroad stocks on the eve of the war, then saw his stocks soar in value as railroads became essential to the war effort. He also made bold trades in undervalued railroads, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. Along with Jacob Barker, Daniel Drew, James Fisk, Jay Gould, Jacob Little, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, Keep was one of the greatest speculators on the stock market in his day. He also became one of the ablest stock pool managers in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. He was so successful at stock pools that he became one of the first managers of a \\"blind pool\\", where not even the contributors to the pool knew which stocks were being bought or sold, when, or at what price. His refusal to talk about his trading schemes earned him the nickname \\"Henry the Silent\\". Keep formed a partnership with LeGrand Lockwood, co-founder of Lockwood & Company. The firm was one of Wall Street's leading brokerage houses, Lockwood was a longtime ally of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Together, the two men manipulated the stock of the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad in the 1850s, buying large quantities whenever they forced the price down. They won control of the company in 1859. On April 25, 1860, Keep was elected to its board of directors. He served as its treasurer from 1861 to 1863. Keep solidified his hold on the company in 1863 by breaking Addison G. Jerome, who controlled a majority of the company's stock. Keep noticed that the board of directors was authorized to issue up to 14,000 shares in new stock. Keep called a secret meeting of the board, which excluded Jerome, and the board authorized the issue. Keep began selling small numbers of these shares, and Jerome began buying them up in an attempt to force Keep off the board of directors. To finance his purchases, Jerome engaged in short sales of stock. Keep then dumped the majority of the 14,000 shares on the market, causing the price to drop significantly. Jerome lost $3 million covering his short sales, and was financially broken. (He died a year later.) Keep also invested heavily in the New York Central Railroad. Beginning in 1865, Cornelius Vanderbilt began to wage a long and bitter war for control of the Central. The Central was governed by a clique of men known as the \\"Albany Regency\\", and controlled most of the rail traffic outside of New York City. But Vanderbilt's Hudson River Railroad not only had the only direct link between Albany, New York, and New York City but also had the only rail line into lower Manhattan. Vanderbilt won an agreement with the Central to transfer freight to his line. The contract also required the Central to pay the Hudson River Railroad $100,000 a year ($ in dollars) for keeping extra rolling stock on hand in the summer to handle the increased traffic moving north. Keep, LeGrand Lockwood, and American Express and Wells Fargo founder William Fargo decided to seek control of the Central. They quickly amassed almost two-thirds of the company's stock, and ousted the \\"Albany Regency\\". Keep, elected president of the Central on December 12, 1866, immediately revoked the yearly payment. An outraged Vanderbilt stopped carrying all Central freight. Steamboats could not move the Central's cargoes because the Hudson River was frozen due to a harsh winter. Freight backed up in Albany, and New York City was effectively cut off by rail. The Central's stock price fell. In an attempt to make money off the situation, Keep borrowed a significant number of shares to sell short. Flooding the market with shares only drove the price further downward, and Vanderbilt and his allies quickly purchased these shares. This forced Keep to pay his lenders out of his own pocket, hurting him financially, and allowed the Vanderbilt group to gain control of the Central. Keep resigned, and Horace Henry Baxter was named president of the Central in December 1866. Keep partnered with investor Rufus Hatch, and won control of the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1867. He made $1.5 million ($ in dollars) manipulating the road's stock. He was named its president in June 1868. Marvin Hughett, a veteran manager of the company, convinced him to finance a massive expansion of the railroad's system. Keep also was one of the largest investors in the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad. He was elected to its board of directors in 1859. He was also a director of the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad in 1863. Personal life and death Keep married Emma Woodruff, daughter of a prominent Watertown hotel owner and real estate developer, in 1847. The couple had just one child, daughter Emma Gertrude Keep. Keep's health began to fail in early 1869. He was so ill that, on June 18, rumors swept Wall Street that he had died. Keep passed away late in the evening on July 30, 1869, at his home at 601 Fifth Avenue in New York City. He had just recently offered to donate $1.5 million to anyone willing to found a National Academy of Art. Keep's funeral was held in his home, and he was buried at Brookside Cemetery in Watertown, New York. His widow built a large mausoleum in which he was later laid to rest. In the Adams State Road Cemetery near Adams, New York, is a large mausoleum, built by Henry Keep, in which Keep's parents were laid to rest. Henry Keep's mausoleum was broken into in 1973, and his coffin opened and his remains disturbed. Police said that the vandals probably believed Keep had been buried with jewelry or other valuables. No culprits were ever found. Keep left his daughter $500,000 ($ in dollars) in railroad stock. His gave his sister Mary two farms near Watertown worth $185,000 ($ in dollars), his sister Martha $200,000 ($ in dollars) in cash, and each of his three sisters-in-law stock worth $100,000 ($ in dollars). The remainder of his estate, valued contemporaneously at $1 million ($ in dollars), and by financial historians at $4.5 million ($ in dollars), went to his wife. Legacy Keep's widow built the Henry Keep Home for the elderly, infirm, and widowed in Watertown. It opened in 1883. The building was razed in 1977, and a new structure erected on the same site. It is now known as the Samaritan-Keep House. Emma Keep also created a foundation in her husband's name to support the Henry Keep Home. The foundation built and currently owns several structures in Watertown: the Centennial Apartments, the Henry Keep Apartments on Washington Street, the Henry Keep Apartments on Public Square, and the Olympic Apartments. It also owns and maintains the Ives Hill Retirement Community as well as Keep House, a place for out-of-town families to stay while their loved ones are receiving medical care at the local hospital.

A former Premier of Eastern Highlands Province under the former provincial government system, he has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since 2012, representing Henganofi Open, first as an independent and then later for the People's National Congress. He has been Minister for Police in the government of Peter O'Neill since February 2014. Atiyafa was educated at the Finintugu Lutheran Primary School, Rongo Primary School and Asaroka Lutheran High School in the Eastern Highlands Province and Kerevat National High School in East New Britain Province, before graduating from the University of Papua New Guinea in political science. Prior to entering politics, he was a teacher at Henganofi High School, a public servant for the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and council manager for the Henganofi Local Level Government Council. He was elected to the former Eastern Highlands Provincial Assembly for the Kafetina constituency in 1991, and was Premier of Eastern Highlands Province from 1991 to 1994. Following the 1995 abolition of decentralised provincial government, he was deputy governor of the province from 1995 to 1997. He was elected to the National Parliament as an independent at the 2012 election on his fifth attempt. He had previously been defeated in the Henganofi seat at the 1997, 2002 and 2007 elections, on the last occasion for the National Party. He immediately caused some controversy by proposing a bill that would ban commissions of inquiry and tribunals in what a major newspaper described as \\"an attempt to legalise official corruption\\". In February 2014, Atiyafa, who had by now joined the governing People's National Congress, was appointed Minister for Police. His government has faced a number of challenges in the police portfolio: in May 2015, Police Commissioner Geoffrey Vaki was sacked over concerns about declining standards and police brutality, and in August 2015 he directed police to refrain from carrying firearms in public wherever possible. He supported the involvement of Australian advisors in training Papua New Guinean police and advocated for the recruitment of officers from overseas in on-the-ground roles accountable to Papua New Guinean law, while expressing cynicism about previous arrangements involving the deployment of foreign police. During the 2016 student protests against the O'Neill government, he denied international media reports that demonstrators had been shot by police and stated that protestors preventing students from returning to class were \\"obstructing the rule of law and open to arrest and prosecution\\".

The factory had been producing tourbillon movements since 2000. Like many Chinese manufacturers, the factory Shum's father invested in had the technical know-how to produce elegant watch movements but no experience in creating a watch brand and taking it to market. At the time of the foundation of Memorigin, Shum was quoted saying, ‚Äúthere were only about 30 factories in the entire world making tourbillon, and only a few in China.‚Äù During the same interview with the NY Times, Shum stated that Swiss tourbillon watches in the market were limited and expensive. He felt that there was an opportunity to sell unique tourbillions into the watch market at more affordable prices. Watches =Models= The first watch model sold by the brand was the 2011 edition of the 'Antique', which retailed for US$3,800. Since its launch, the watchmaker has moved into high-end collectibles, such as their 2013 'Emperor Jade' model. The 'Emperor Jade' contained translucent sheets of precious hand- carved stones. This particular model was at the higher-end of the Memorigin range, priced at $38,000. Memorigin has also designed watches to be used as movie-themed merchandise in collaboration with global brands. Their Marvel watch collection featured well-known characters on the watch faces, such as Iron Man and Captain America. They have also designed watches for Hollywood merchandise, including Warner Brothers and Hasbro. They made Batman and Superman memorabilia watches for Warner Brothers and Transformers watches for Hasbro. This focus on superheroes is due to the Chinese interest in comics and the subsequent movies produced by various Hollywood studios. Shum stated, \\"most Hongkongers between the ages of 30 and 50 like superheroes, because we grew up with many of them, and they represent justice.\\" When asked about the difference between Chinese tourbillions and Swiss tourbillons, Shum stated \\"Chinese watches are developing and the target customers are not the same as those who buy exclusively Swiss watches. Swiss watches are produced in fewer quantities with a strong passion for traditional design and delicate functions. Chinese watches are now produced in larger quantities with more reasonable pricing.\\" =Design= The tourbillon watches made by Memorigin are unique because they fuse Chinese and Western design elements. When founding Memorigin, Shum stated he wanted to create watches that possess \\"Swiss precision with Chinese characteristics.‚Äù In an interview with Forbes, Shum stated thatMemorigin watches are often designed in collaboration with well- known Hong Kong watch collectors. Memorigin has always stated their interest in becoming a tailor-made watch brand, rather than a mass producer.

The book is about the Appalachian values of his upbringing and their relation to the social problems of his hometown. The book was on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2016 and 2017. It was a finalist for the 2017 Dayton Literary Peace Prize.Dayton Literary Peace Prize. http://www.daytonliterarypeaceprize.org/ It attracted significant attention during the 2016 election from national media as a window into the white working class. In addition to the popular attention and critical acclaim the book received, it also provoked criticism from Appalachians who argued that Vance was not an authentic hillbilly or representative of the white working class. These critics allege that in Vance's book the author misleadingly conflates the experience and identity of his hillbilly grandparents, with whom he spent some summers as a boy, with his own. Other critics supported Vance's claims to represent this culture. Politically, Vance identifies as a social conservative who is nevertheless critical of the contemporary Republican Party's policies, particularly on economic policy, where he argues the Republican platform favors the interests of the wealthy at the expense of the working class. Early life James David Vance was born in August 1984 in Middletown, Ohio, as James Donald Bowman, the son of Donald Bowman and Bev Vance. Vance's only sister, Lindsay, had been born when his mother was 19 years old. His mother and father divorced when Vance was a toddler. Not long after, Vance was adopted by his mother's third husband. Vance's mother struggled with prescription pain medication which led to heroin addiction throughout his childhood. She left behind a string of husbands and offered little stability. As a result Vance and his sister were raised primarily by his grandparents. Education Vance was educated at Middletown High School, a public high school in his home town. After graduating, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served in Iraq, performing public affairs activities.https://www.ted.com/speakers/jd_vance Vance later received a B.A. degree from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. At Ohio State, he worked for Republican state senator Bob Schuler. After graduating from Ohio State, Vance received a J.D. degree from Yale Law School. During his first year at Yale, his mentor and professor Amy Chua convinced him to write his memoir. Life and career After law school, Vance worked as a principal in a venture capital firm owned by Peter Thiel, known as Mithril Capital Management, LLC. In 2020, Vance raised $93 million for Narya Capital, based in Cincinnati, Ohio. In December 2016, Vance indicated that he planned to move to Ohio to start a nonprofit and potentially run for office and work on combating drug addiction in the Rust Belt. The nonprofit is called Our Ohio Renewal.Our Ohio Renewal http://ourohiorenewal.com/ In January 2017, Vance became a CNN Contributor. In April 2017, Ron Howard signed on to direct a film based on Hillbilly Elegy. In early 2018, Vance was reported to have been considering a bid for U.S. Senate as a Republican. Personal life Vance is married to one of his former law school classmates, Usha Chilukuri, an Indian-American woman who was a law clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts during the 2017‚Äì18 term and clerked for then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 2014‚Äì15.

Since then the church has changed its view in favor of the use of medical marijuana, but not recreational use.\\"We are in favor of appropriate use of medicinal marijuana, and it's our view that by calling upon our legislature and local leaders, we can quickly find an appropriate resolution.\\" ‚ÄîElder Jack N. Gerard of the Seventy https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-says-yes-to-regulated- medical-marijuana-but-no-to-utah-initiative?lang=eng Early prohibitions In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members, and two months later the state of Utah banned cannabis. Some scholars have linked the two events, arguing that cannabis usage by Mormon returnees who had earlier fled to Mexico led the church, and later the state, to make their decisions. Others contradict this, noting that Utah's prohibition laws were part of a larger package of anti-drug laws which happened to include cannabis, but did not indicate a statewide concern. 1971 decriminalization The decriminalization effort in 1971 was said to be strong in Utah due to the state's high rate of use of cannabis, and Mormon members' preference to handle matters within the church and family. Response to modern cannabis movement As medical and recreational cannabis decriminalization movements began in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century in the United States, the LDS Church has been asked for its position on the issue. In a 2010 conference for local church leaders in Colorado, general authorities of the church, including now current church president Russell M. Nelson, explained in answer to a question that the church has no position on medical marijuana and that the issue was left to individual consultation with scriptures and a member's bishop. This same stance was later reiterated in a private discussion among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in a 2010 video that was made public in 2016. The discussion included consensus that the church opposed recreational marijuana use more broadly but had no position on medical use specifically. In February 2016, the church released a statement supporting efforts to legalize CBD oil in Utah, but not whole-plant cannabis remedies: In October 2016, the First Presidency of the LDS Church sent a letter to congregations in California, Nevada, and Arizona (states which were to vote on legalized recreational cannabis in November), urging members to oppose legalization: In a 2019 article in the church's youth magazine New Era, the following statement was given regarding cannabis: See also * Cannabis and religion * Religion and drugs References Further reading Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Latter Day Saint doctrines, beliefs, and practices 1915 in cannabis Cannabis in Utah The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ","title":"Cannabis and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"},{"id":"53396571","text":"Jean-Baptiste Pierre de Semell√© (16 June 1773 ‚Äì 25 January 1839) became a French division commander during the Napoleonic Wars.

Geology of the Blue Ridge in Virginia: Geology of the Blue Ridge in Virginia, accessdate: March 5, 2017 Cultural history Just south of the wilderness area on Apple Orchard Mountain, Apple Orchard Camp offered overnight accommodations in the early 1900s. In 1924 the camp became Camp Kewanzee, a summer camp for boys and girls. During the Cold War a nearby area was developed as a radar-based tracking station, and in the 1960s a large computer complex was built to process data for transmission to Fort Lee, Virginia. The military base was closed in 1975 leaving a single radar dome and other facilities. The dome, a prominent feature on the tallest mountain along the parkway in Virginia, can be seen from a long distance. In 1928 during a violent storm, a balloon, participating in an international balloon race, crashed in the night onto Thunder Hill. Major injuries were sustained, especially during the climb down the mountain.

It is served as a side dish, used as an ingredient in dishes such as coq au vin and beef bourguignon, in foods such as duxelles, as a topping for steaks and toast, and also as a garnish. Overview Saut√©ed mushrooms is a common dish prepared by the saut√©ing of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when saut√©ing the dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked over a high heat until the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled. During the cooking process, the dish can be deglazed with the use of wine, and wine can be used as an ingredient in and of itself without deglazing. The dish can be flavored with lemon juice, various herbs and seasonings, salt and pepper. Additional ingredients such as minced green onions and shallots can also be used. The dish is vegetarian, and may have a meat-like texture. Uses Saut√©ed mushrooms is sometimes served as a side dish, and is also used as an ingredient in the preparation of dishes and foods such as beef bourguignon, coq au vin, poulet en cocotte, Poulet Saute Chasseur, soups and stews, sauces, and duxelles, a paste prepared by saut√©ing mushrooms, onions, shallots, and herbs in butter. Saut√©ed mushrooms is also used as a topping for cooked steaks and toast, as a side dish meant to specifically accompany steaks, and as a garnish. The dish can serve to add significant flavor to various dishes, in part per the glutamic acid present in the cells of edible mushrooms (see also: glutamate flavoring).

By late 1987, the hotel building designed by architect K.Y. Cheung had acquired its iconic Chinese hip-and- gable roof covered in traditional glazed roof tiles, which remains a signature feature in the area today. After three years of construction, the hotel opened in May 1989. The hotel was constructed and initially owned by the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department, who transferred their shares to China Everbright Group in 1999. The first stores in Mainland China for Louis Vuitton, Chanel & Herm√®s opened in the hotel's shopping arcade during the 1990s. =The Peninsula Beijing= The Peninsula Hotels assumed management of The Palace Hotel in 1996, and the following year the hotel undertook its first renovation. The guest rooms were redesigned to include proprietary in-room technology that was, at the time, unique for a hotel in Beijing. In September 2003, The Palace Hotel was renamed The Peninsula Palace Beijing. In 2006, it became The Peninsula Beijing, following the completion of a four-year phased renovation from 2000 - 2004. = Major Renovation = In 2016, 27 years after its original opening, The Peninsula Beijing embarked upon an RMB890 million (US$123 million) landmark renovation. The renovation doubled the size of its rooms and renovated all its public spaces. The number of units was reduced from 525 to 230.  Prominent Visitors  Since its opening in 1989, The Peninsula Beijing has hosted a range of prominent visitors.

Three-dimensional Euclidean space can be completely filled by copies of any one of these shapes, with no overlaps. The resulting honeycomb will have symmetries that take any copy of the plesiohedron to any other copy. The plesiohedra include such well- known shapes as the cube, hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron. The largest number of faces that a plesiohedron can have is 38. Definition A set S of points in Euclidean space is a Delone set if there exists a number varepsilon>0 such that every two points of S are at least at distance varepsilon apart from each other and such that every point of space is within distance 1/varepsilon of at least one point in S. So S fills space, but its points never come too close to each other. For this to be true, S must be infinite. Additionally, the set S is symmetric (in the sense needed to define a plesiohedron) if, for every two points p and q of S, there exists a rigid motion of space that takes S to S and p to q. That is, the symmetries of S act transitively on S. The Voronoi diagram of any set S of points partitions space into regions called Voronoi cells that are nearer to one given point of S than to any other. When S is a Delone set, the Voronoi cell of each point p in S is a convex polyhedron. The faces of this polyhedron lie on the planes that perpendicularly bisect the line segments from p to other nearby points of S.. See especially section 1.2.1, \\"Regularly Placed Sites\\", pp. 354‚Äì355. When S is symmetric as well as being Delone, the Voronoi cells must all be congruent to each other, for the symmetries of S must also be symmetries of the Voronoi diagram. In this case, the Voronoi diagram forms a honeycomb in which there is only a single prototile shape, the shape of these Voronoi cells. This shape is called a plesiohedron. The tiling generated in this way is isohedral, meaning that it not only has a single prototile (\\"monohedral\\") but also that any copy of this tile can be taken to any other copy by a symmetry of the tiling.. As with any space-filling polyhedron, the Dehn invariant of a plesiohedron is necessarily zero.. Examples The plesiohedra include the five parallelohedra. These are polyhedra that can tile space in such a way that every tile is symmetric to every other tile by a translational symmetry, without rotation. Equivalently, they are the Voronoi cells of lattices, as these are the translationally-symmetric Delone sets. Plesiohedra are a special case of the stereohedra, the prototiles of isohedral tilings more generally. For this reason (and because Voronoi diagrams are also known as Dirichlet tesselations) they have also been called \\"Dirichlet stereohedra\\" There are only finitely many combinatorial types of plesiohedron. Notable individual plesiohedra include: *The five parallelohedra: the cube (or more generally the parallelepiped), hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, elongated dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron.. Voronoi conjectured that all tilings of higher dimensional spaces by translates of a single convex polytope are combinatorially equivalent to Voronoi tilings, and Erdahl proves this in the special case of zonotopes. But as he writes (p. 429), Voronoi's conjecture for dimensions at most four was already proven by Delaunay. For the classification of three-dimensional parallelohedra into these five types, see . *The triangular prism, the prototile of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.. More generally, each of the 11 types of Laves tiling of the plane by congruent convex polygons (and each of the subtypes of these tilings with different symmetry groups) can be realized as the Voronoi cells of a symmetric Delone set in the plane.. It follows that the prisms over each of these shapes are plesiohedra. As well as the triangular prisms, these include prisms over certain quadrilaterals, pentagons, and hexagons. *The gyrobifastigium is a stereohedron but not a plesiohedron, because the points at the centers of the cells of its face-to-face tiling (where they are forced to go by symmetry) have differently-shaped Voronoi cells. However, a flattened version of the gyrobifastigium, with faces made of isosceles right triangles and silver rectangles, is a plesiohedron. *The triakis truncated tetrahedron, the prototile of the triakis truncated tetrahedral honeycomb and the plesiohedron generated by the diamond lattice *The trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron, the prototile of the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb and the plesiohedron generated by the hexagonal close-packing *The 17-sided Voronoi cells of the Laves graph. Many other plesiohedra are known. Two different ones with the largest known number of faces, 38, were discovered by crystallographer Peter Engel.. For many years the maximum number of faces of a plesiohedron was an open problem,.. but analysis of the possible symmetries of three-dimensional space has shown that this number is at most 38. The Voronoi cells of points uniformly spaced on a helix fill space, are all congruent to each other, and can be made to have arbitrarily large numbers of faces.. However, the points on a helix are not a Delone set and their Voronoi cells are not bounded polyhedra. A modern survey is given by Schmitt..

Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for a second term and received the support of 14 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council. However, the United States vetoed his re-selection and eventually forced him to withdraw his candidacy. The open selection then deadlocked as France vetoed all candidates from English-speaking countries, while the United States vetoed all candidates from French-speaking countries. France eventually changed its veto to an abstention, and Kofi Annan of Ghana was selected Secretary-General for a term beginning 1 January 1997. The 1996 selection marks the only time that a sitting Secretary-General was denied a second term.  Background  The elderly Boutros-Ghali initially intended to serve only one term, but he ran for a second term in 1996. Traditionally, the Secretary-General is entitled to run unopposed for a second term. No sitting Secretary-General had ever been denied a second term by a veto. In the 1950 selection, Trygve Lie was vetoed by the Soviet Union, but he was re-appointed by the General Assembly without a recommendation from the Security Council. In the 1976 selection, Kurt Waldheim received a single symbolic veto from China, which turned around and voted for him in the second round. Boutros Boutros- Ghali had been selected Secretary-General in 1991 without the support of the United States, which abstained. After 15 U.S. peacekeepers died in a failed raid in Somalia in 1993, Boutros-Ghali became a political scapegoat in the United States. U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright criticized Boutros-Ghali for the failed raid, and U.S. president Bill Clinton announced that future U.S. peacekeepers \\"will be under American command.\\" However, the dead peacekeepers had already been under U.S. command. Tensions grew worse as Boutros-Ghali pressed the United States over $1.5 billion in unpaid U.N. dues, while the United States pushed him to cut programs that were favored by developing countries. The breaking point came over the Bosnian War, when Boutros-Ghali refused to allow British and French commanders to authorize airstrikes against Serb troops. During the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign, Republican candidate Bob Dole made fun of Boutros-Ghali's name, and Clinton decided to eliminate Boutros-Ghali to help in his own reelection bid.  Re-selection of Boutros- Ghali  Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for re-selection, as he enjoyed the support of every other member of the Security Council and was backed by the developing countries in the General Assembly. Boutros-Ghali had the support of France, as he spoke French fluently and had studied at the Sorbonne. Supporters of Boutros-Ghali also hoped that China would fight a veto duel with the United States, as it had done in the deadlocked 1981 selection. If the 1996 selection could be deadlocked, then the General Assembly could appoint Boutros-Ghali to a second term without a recommendation from the Security Council. The United States had set the precedent by taking the 1950 selection directly to the General Assembly after the Soviet Union vetoed Trygve Lie's second term. = Operation Orient Express = Madeleine Albright, Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and James Rubin entered a secret pact, which they called \\"Operation Orient Express.\\" The name reflected their hope that other countries would join the United States in overthrowing Boutros-Ghali. However, U.S. President Bill Clinton told them that they \\"would never pull it off.\\" As support for Boutros-Ghali grew, the United States increased the pressure on his supporters. U.S. officials threatened to \\"take action\\" against U.N. officials who campaigned for Boutros-Ghali using U.N. funds, even though it could not name anyone who had done so. An unnamed U.S. official warned in a United States Information Agency report that continued support for Boutros- Ghali would cost Africa its second term in the Secretary-General rotation. The United States even offered to support Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, who had been vetoed by the U.S. after winning the 1981 selection by one vote. A former U.N. official said that the Clinton administration appeared to be in a \\"frenzy\\" over Boutros-Ghali's resistance. On 17 November 1996, U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright asked Boutros-Ghali to resign and offered to start a new foundation in Geneva for Boutros-Ghali to run. Other Western diplomats called the offer \\"ludicrous,\\" as Boutros-Ghali's family was wealthy and already supported several foundations in Egypt, while Albright would have a hard time convincing the U.S. Congress to pay for a foundation. Boutros-Ghali declined the American offer and said that he was not looking for another job. = US veto = On 18 November 1996, the United Nations Security Council conducted a straw poll to gauge the level of support for Boutros-Ghali. The vote was 13‚Äì1‚Äì1, with only the United States voting against. The United Kingdom delegation abstained because it had not received any instructions from London. On 20 November 1996, the Security Council met in closed session to consider draft resolution S/1996/952, appointing Boutros-Ghali for a second term. The resolution received 14 votes in favor, 1 vote against, and no abstentions. The only negative vote was the promised U.S. veto. The U.S. veto was widely criticized by foreign diplomats, who referred to it as a \\"mugging.\\" Boutros- Ghali complained that he was not \\"Noriega or Saddam Hussein\\" and compared the United States to the Roman Empire. CNN founder Ted Turner said that \\"Even England voted to re-elect this man and England always does what the United States asks them to do.\\" British diplomat Brian Urquhart described members of the U.S. Congress were \\"very xenophobic, extremely touchy, and, I think, very ignorant,\\" and said that the Secretary-General \\"isn't supposed to be a member of the [U.S.] State Department.\\" Even the conservative New York Post criticized Clinton for \\"indulg[ing] an obsession\\" and \\"demonstrat[ing] extraordinary diplomatic isolation.\\" Meanwhile, the conspirators in Operation Orient Express prevailed on Clinton to resist foreign pressure and continue the veto. = Deadlock = The Security Council met again on 21 November 1996 and 25 November 1996. No vote was taken, as none of the members had changed their positions. The United States also refused to nominate its own candidate, who would certainly be rejected by the Security Council. U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright insisted that the Africans must come up with their own candidate to replace Boutros-Ghali. American diplomats again warned that Africa would lose its turn in the Secretary-Generalship rotation if they did not come up with another candidate. However, Botswana's representative said that \\"We have a list composed of one person, Dr. Boutros-Ghali.\\" On 29 November 1996, the Security Council met again without taking a vote. The same day, the Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity wrote its members soliciting additional nominations. However, no nominations were forthcoming, as no African country wanted to undermine Boutros-Ghali by nominating another candidate. France and other European nations suggested a compromise in which Boutros-Ghali would be appointed to a short two-year term, following the precedent of U Thant's selection for a 17-month term in 1961. However, the United States did not respond to these proposals. The impasse was finally broken on 5 December 1996, when Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy. The selection was now thrown open to other candidates.  Open selection  Anticipating the U.S. veto, Security Council President Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia laid down procedures on 12 November 1996 to be followed in case of an open selection. The Security Council would vote in secret in a series of straw polls. After a likely winner emerged, the next straw poll would have the permanent members voting on red paper to reveal the existence of any vetoes, while the rotating members voted on white paper. When at least one candidate received at least nine votes and no vetoes, a Resolution would finally be introduced and a vote would be taken. The \\"Wisnumurti Guidelines\\" formalized the process that had been used to break the deadlocked selection of 1981, and they have been used in all subsequent open selections. Four African candidates were nominated to replace Boutros-Ghali: Amara Essy of C√¥te d'Ivoire, Kofi Annan of Ghana, Hamid Algabid of Niger, and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania. The Security Council met on 6 December 1996 but did not vote, awaiting more candidates. However, no other candidates were nominated. Moustapha Niasse of Senegal was not nominated because he would be vetoed by China. Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania was not nominated because he would be vetoed by France, an ironic twist for a diplomat who had been vetoed by the United States in 1981. With the General Assembly expecting to end its session on 17 December 1996, the Security Council had only one week to select a Secretary-General. In the first straw poll on 10 December 1996, Annan led with a vote of 12-2-1 with 1 veto, and Essy came in second with a vote of 11-4-0 with 2 vetoes. Annan was vetoed by France, while Essy was vetoed by the United States and the United Kingdom. Although Annan spoke French fluently, Ghana is a former British colony and Annan attended university in the United States. In the second round, Annan led with a vote of 10-3-1 with 1 veto, and Essy came in second with 7 votes in favor and 2 vetoes. All of the French-speaking candidates were vetoed by the United States and the United Kingdom. In the third round on 11 December 1996, Annan led with a vote of 11-4-0, including a French veto. Essy was in second place with a vote of 6-4-4, including U.S. and British vetoes. Despite the deadlock between the French-speaking and the English-speaking countries, diplomats believed that they had to find an African for the post because China would veto any non-African candidate. In the fourth round on 12 December 1996, Annan became the favored candidate with a vote of 14-1-0, the sole negative vote being a French veto. On 13 December 1996, France dropped its veto against Annan. The Security Council adopted Resolution 1090 by acclamation, recommending Kofi Annan to be the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. On 17 December 1996, the General Assembly adopted Resolution A/51/L.66, appointing Kofi Annan as Secretary- General for a term ending 31 December 2001.  2001 re-selection  Kofi Annan ran unopposed for re-selection in 2001. Due to Boutros-Ghali's non-reelection, a second Annan term would give Africa the office of Secretary-General for three consecutive terms. In 2001, the Asia-Pacific Group agreed to a third term for Africa in return for the African Group's support for an Asian Secretary-General in the 2006 selection. The Security Council passed Resolution 1358 by acclamation on 27 June 2001, recommending Annan for a second term. The General Assembly approved his reappointment on 29 June 2001 in Resolution A/55/L.87. Annan's second term ran until 31 December 2006, setting the stage for the 2006 Secretary-General selection.

Previously, dinoflagellates had been grouped into two categories, phagotrophs and phototrophs. Mixotrophs, however include a combination of phagotrophy and phototrophy. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are a sub-type of planktonic dinoflagellates and are part of the phylum Dinoflagellata. They are flagellated eukaryotes that combine photoautotrophy when light is available, and heterotrophy via phagocytosis. Dinoflagellates are one of the most diverse and numerous species of phytoplankton, second to diatoms. Dinoflagellates have long whip-like structures called flagella that allow them to move freely throughout the water column. They are mainly marine but can also be found in freshwater environments. Combinations of phototrophy and phagotrophy allow organisms to supplement their inorganic nutrient uptake This means an increased trophic transfer to higher levels in food web compared to the traditional food web. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates have the ability to thrive in changing ocean environments, resulting in shifts in red tide phenomenon and paralytic shellfish poisoning. It is unknown as to how many species of dinoflagellates have mixotrophic capabilities, as this is a relatively new feeding-mechanism discovery.  Species  Some dinoflagellates that live as parasites are probably mixotrophic. Karenia, Karlodinium, and Lepidodinium are some of the dinoflagellate genera which are thought to contain peridinin, a carotenoid pigment necessary for photosynthesis in dinoflagellates; however, chlorophyll b has been found in these genera as an accessory pigment. This discovery has led scientists to assume that the pigment chlorophyll b actually came from prey which had been ingested by the dinoflagellates. Some species of mixotrophic dinoflagellate are able to feed on toxic prey such as toxic algae and other toxic organisms. For example, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Akashiwo sanguinea are two species of mixotrophic dinoflagellates that are known to feed on the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense. Certain species of mixotrophic dinoflagellates can be affected by light intensity and nutrient conditions . For example, ingestion rates of Fragilidium subglobosum, Gymnodinium gracilentum, and Karlodinium veneficum increase as light intensity increases up to 75 to 100 ¬µmol photon m‚àí2 s‚àí1. In contrast, other species are not affected by light intensity. As well, ingestion rates of the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Ceratium furca are affected by intracellular nutrient concentrations.  Types of feeding  Marine dinoflagellate species undergo three major trophic modes: autotrophy, mixotrophy and heterotrophy. Many species of dinoflagellates were previously assumed to be exclusively autotrophic; however, recent research has revealed that many dinoflagellates that were thought to be exclusively phototrophic are actually mixotrophic. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can undergo both photosynthesis and phagocytosis as methods of feeding. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mostly on photosynthesis can prey on other cells as their secondary source of nutrients. On the other hand, mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mainly on phagocytosis are also photosynthetic due to chloroplasts 'stolen' from their prey (kleptochloroplasts) or because of algal endosymbionts. It was discovered that the mixotrophic dinoflagellates Gonyaulax polygramma and Scrippsiella spp. can engulf small-size prey using their apical horn while larger prey are engulfed via their sulcus, showing that dinoflagellates can have more than one mouth for feeding. Moreover, mixotrophic dinoflagellates belonging to the species Karlodinium armiger, can capture small prey by direct engulfment or can use an extendable peduncle to capture larger prey.  Implications for microbial food webs  Mixotroph dinoflagellates belonging to the species Gymnodinium sanguineum feed on nanociliate populations in Chesapeake Bay. Predation on ciliates is advantageous for G. sanguineum as the ciliates provide a source of nitrogen which is limiting to the growth of purely photosynthetic dinoflagellates. By preying on ciliates, these dinoflagellates reverse the normal flow of material from primary producer to consumer and influence the trophodynamics of the microbial food web in Chesapeake Bay Several established ecological models of marine microbial food webs have not included feeding by mixotrophic dinoflagellates. These additions would include feeding by mixotrophic dinoflagellates on bacteria, phytoplankton, other mixotrophic dinoflagellates and nanoflagellates, and heterotrophic protists. The impact of grazing by mixotrophic dinoflagellates will affect particular prey species and be influenced by the abundance of dinoflagellate predators and their ingestion rates. Another consideration would be to include predator-prey relationships of mixotrophic dinoflagellates at a species level due to co-existence in offshore and oceanic waters. The diversity of mixotrophic dinoflagellate species and their interactions with other marine organisms contributes to their diverse roles in different niche environments. For example, mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates may act as predators on a wide range of prey types due to their diverse feeding mechanisms. Including mixotrophic dinoflagellates would better explain the control of prey population and cycling of limited materials as well as competition between other organisms for larger prey.  Climate Change and Ocean Acidification  As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increase via anthropogenic causes, acidification of the ocean will increase as the result of increasing CO2 sequestration by the ocean; the ocean is a great sink for carbon, absorbing more as its concentration in the atmosphere increases. As this occurs, there will be species and community composition shifts in marine plankton communities. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates will be favoured over photosynthetic dinoflagellates, as the oceans will become more nutrient limited and mixotrophs will not have to rely only on inorganic nutrients but will be able to take advantage of being able to consume particulate organic matter. With an increase in temperature, there is an increase in water column stability, which leads to favourable conditions for mixotrophic growth. Mixotrophs can grow in low nutrient (more stable) environments and become dominant members of planktonic communities. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can be caused by increased stability or increases in nutrients due to acidification and climate change, as well. This can have large impacts on the food chain and pose harmful effects to humans and their food sources through harmful blooms of dinoflagellates and other taxa, and lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning, for example.  Influence on red tide and HABs  Algal bloom (akasio) by Noctiluca spp. in Nagasaki Many mixotrophic and some heterotrophic dinoflagellates are known to cause red tides or harmful blooms that result in large-scale mortality of fish and shellfish. Studies on red tides have been conducted to determine the mechanism of outbreak and the persistence of red tides caused by mixotrophic dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Prorocentrum minimum in low nutrient concentration waters. In the case of serial red tides, one mixotrophic dinoflagellate species is dominated by another mixotrophic species in rapid succession over a short span of days. A possible explanation for the occurrence of different dominant mixotrophic dinoflagellates during serial red tides is the ability of mixotrophic dinoflagellates to feed on both heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria (such as Synecchococcus) spp., which provide limiting nutrients such as phosphorus, and nitrogen simultaneously. It is proposed that during serial red tides, feeding by larger mixotrophic dinoflagellates on smaller species may be a driving force for the succession of dominant species. Nitrogen and phosphorus is taken up by direct transfer of the materials and energy between the mixotrophic dinoflagellates; therefore, nutrient supply does not rely on the release of nitrogen and phosphorus by other organisms. Hence, mixotrophy can cause uncoupling between nutrient concentrations and the abundance of mixotrophic dinoflagellates in natural environments. Red tides are a type of harmful algal bloom (HABs); both are the result of massive proliferation of algae that result in very high concentrations of cells that visibly colour the water. The very high levels of biomass in Red Tides or HABs can have direct toxic effects through the release of toxic compounds or indirect effects through oxygen depletion on mammals, fish, shellfish, and humans. PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) is one example of a toxin that is produced by dinoflagellates that can have lethal consequences if contaminated shellfish are ingested; the toxin is a neuro- inhibitor that is concentrated in the flesh of bivalves and molluscs that have fed on toxic algae The toxin concentrations can cause harmful and even deadly effects on humans and marine mammal populations that feed on contaminated shellfish.  Relationship to other organisms  Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can feed on various organisms including bacteria, picoeukaryotes, nanoflagellates, diatoms, protists, metazoans and other dinoflagellates, as well. Feeding and digestion rates in mixotrophic dinoflagellates are lower than those in strictly heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates do not feed on blood, eggs, adult metazoans, and flesh, such as occurs in some heterotrophic dinoflagellates.

She co- founded the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986, but was expelled over a 2009 trip to China. Education and activism Hsu graduated from National Taiwan Normal University. When her husband Chang Chun-hung was imprisoned in the aftermath of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident, Hsu left her job as a teacher to run for the Legislative Yuan. Because Hsu was active in the tangwai movement as a distributor of opposition publications, the Kuomintang raided her house for copies of Senh Kin and Taiwan Weekly in January 1984 and September 1985, respectively. Political career In her 1980 election to the legislature, Hsu won 190,000 votes, a district record, and was the only tangwai-affiliated woman to be seated. During her first term, Hsu continued active participation in opposition causes, visiting jailed activist Lin Hung-hsuan in January 1985 and making a May 1986 trip to the United States to address the first meeting of the US Congressional Committee for Democracy on Taiwan alongside Chou Ching-yu. That September, she and seventeen others founded the Democratic Progressive Party. Within the DPP, Hsu was linked to the New Dynamics and Formosa factions. She was entrusted with the responsibilities of high ranking party posts, becoming the first woman to serve as party whip. Hsu was also chair of the Central Review Committee and has served on the Central Standing Committee. Though she stepped down at the end of her term in 2005, Hsu was reappointed to the Legislative Yuan when Tsai Huang-liang chose to run for the Nantou County magistracy. Hsu was sworn in on 23 June. The next year, Kuomintang legislator Chiu Yi accused Hsu and others of embezzlement. In 2007, Hsu visited China to discuss Cross-Strait crime. Later that year, she was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Summer Games. In 2009, Hsu began attending the Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Culture Forum, despite senior DPP officials having advised her against it. Hsu's party membership was suspended on 23 July 2009, and she was officially expelled four days later. Shortly after her expulsion, Hsu founded the People United Party. She attended the 2010 forum, and the following year declared her candidacy for the 2012 presidential election. Hsu eventually dropped out of the campaign. In 2013, she was again in attendance at the Cross-Strait forum. Hsu sought the presidency again in 2016, and received support from the Taiwan Progressive Party, National Health Service Alliance, and Zhongshan Party. Her candidacy was nullified in November, as the People United Party had not submitted its petition of signatures to the Central Election Commission by the deadline. Personal life Due to the events of the Kaohsiung Incident, Chang Chun-hung and Hsu Jung-shu have separated.

History Nancy Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 30, 1990 due to its presence on a 1975 county highway map published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1211971. The stream is also known as Nancys Run. This variant name appears in a 1939 geological survey of Northampton County by Benjamin L. Miller et al.. Nancy Run was named for an old woman named Nancy who historically lived in a log cabin on the creek and was well known as a fortune teller. In the early 1800s, there was a large tavern on the stream. The community of Freemansburg, which is located at the mouth of the stream, was incorporated in 1856. Two steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridges carrying Washington Street and Keystone Street were built over Nancy Run near Freemansburg in 1930. In 1938, a concrete culvert bridge carrying State Route 3007 was constructed over the stream. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Middletown Road was constructed over the creek in 1958, and in 1960, a prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 3007 was built over the creek. Three concrete culvert bridges were built over Nancy Run in 2000; one carried Tenth Street in Nancy Run Estates and the other two carried Bridge Lane and Washington Street in the Emerald Hills Development. In 2014, the Northampton County Conservation District received a $5000 grant from the Coldwater Heritage Partnership to develop a Coldwater Conservation Plan for the watershed of Nancy Run. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Nancy Run from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. Upstream of a State Route 3007 bridge, the creek's watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Below this point, it is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The stream is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters for brown trout in its lower . In the 1990s, Nancy Run was found to support a benthic ecosystem of high biodiversity, including one sensitive species. The stream also supported a number of fish species. However, a proposed highway extension was believed to potentially impact biodiversity by releasing organic and inorganic pollutants into the stream, although they would not have been directly impacted by the construction. Macroinvertebrate taxa found in Nancy Run in the 1970s include Oligochaeta, sowbugs, scuds, mayflies, caddisflies, beetles, Diptera (flies/midges), blackflies, and snails.

His parents moved to Charlotte in 1857 and founded the Charlotte Female Institute that year, which is now Queens University of Charlotte. After graduating from Davidson College in 1859 he taught school. Teaching in Princeton, Arkansas at the start of the Civil War, he served as adjutant in Company A of the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry, reached the rank of Captain.

He also studied law and became licensed to practice in 1869. He entered law partnerships with Calvin E. Grier and then Zebulon Baird Vance, a former Confederate officer and North Carolina governor during the Confederacy, and future United States senator, in a firm named Vance & Burwell.

Background Well known militant and socialist as well as suspected dynamitist, Thomas Mooney, was tried and convicted in 1916 for the Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco, which led to the death of ten and injury of forty more. His trial, it seemed, was nothing more than a show with coached witnesses and the air of a lynch mob. While the American Socialist Party was at first ready to expel him, his local branch stood by him and he began to gain the support of an increasingly agitated domestic and international left wing community, which only further radicalized with the introduction of the draft. So much so that Woodrow Wilson felt compelled to start a letter writing campaign to the Governor of California William Stephens to commute Mooney's death sentence. Stephens seemed to have missed his chance when in November 1917, the San Francisco Call ran an expos√© suggesting Mooney was framed by prosecutors, basing its findings on a federal investigation conducted under Wilson's orders. (The allegations later gained even more veracity: the prosecution‚Äôs case was riddled with perjury, corruption, suppression of evidence, conflict of interest, and other irregularities ignored by prosecutors.) In the meantime, efforts to recall local District Attorney Charles Fickert, who spearheaded the effort to prosecute Mooney, grew more and more promising with each passing day. Bombing At 11:55 p.m. on December 17, 1917, the Governor and his wife Flora awoke to what they described as a \\"nervous shock\\". While no one was injured, including all of the servants, windows were shattered as far as two to three blocks away. When the police arrived, they found Governor Stephens, with little care, wading through the wet, muddy basement in search of a clue as to how the bomb had been placed. While neither he nor his guard had seen the perpetrator nor the act first hand, they both expressed the belief that the bomb had been thrown from an alley running about 40 feet from the rear of the house. As for the motive, Stephens was convinced of it \\"probably having been done with a view to terrorism, the chief weapon of the alien enemy,\\" a justifiable claim at the time given his recent series of addresses in Southern California urging support for the war. Accounts of one to two men seen fleeing the scene as crowds began to gather were recorded, but none were found despite an extensive search of downtown. Aftermath Men outside IWW Local No. 71 Almost immediately, the Sacramento Chief of Police and most newspapers blamed the Industrial Workers of the World. On Christmas Eve, two members of the IWW were arrested after police claimed they'd picked up dynamite at the union's headquarters in Sacramento. Three days later, the Governor received a letter giving him an ultimatum: $50,000 or nine bombs will be set off across the city. While nothing came of the letter, police raided locals across Northern California and a further 51 union workers were arrested and thrown in jail in January 1918, where 5 died (four to the influenza epidemic and one to tuberculosis) A further 46 were charged with conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act in spite of protests from a local Department of Justice agent. His concerns regarding the prosecution's motives fell on deaf ears in large part because Governor Stephens, Assistant Attorney General Raymond General, the President of the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce and the publisher of the Sacramento Bee all pushed hard for charges and a conviction. Their efforts succeeded and in January 1919, a jury took one hour to convict all 46. All but three were sentenced from 1 to 10 years. The exceptions included two who had access to attorneys and received 2 month sentences as well as the one woman who received a fine. In total, 2,000 Wobblies (IWW members) were arrested between 1917 and 1918 for \\"anarchism\\" or \\"anti-war efforts\\". Weeks after the trial of the 46 IWW members, the California Criminal Syndicalism Act was signed into law, making it a felony, punishable by 1 to 14 years in prison, to advocate \\"violence or sabotage\\" as a means of bringing about \\"a change in industrial ownership or control, or affecting any political change.\\" The statute was used to broadly intimidate political opponents from speaking out and was ruled unconstitutional almost 50 years later. This harsh crackdown on labor and the months long anti-union campaigning by the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Association led many progressives to voice their suspicion. The District Attorney's election had taken place the day after the bombing after all, and the heavy press coverage surely would have helped him. What's more: the bomber didn't seem intent to injure. With all this in mind, a San Francisco reporter on the beat learned that the mansion's guard may have worked with a prominent detective to set up the whole thing. That detective, Martin Swanson, had in fact attempted to set up Mooney in a similar fashion years earlier.Walton, 2015. p. 109-110 References 1917 in California Labor disputes in California Labor disputes in the United States History of the Industrial Workers of the World Political violence in the United States History of the United States (1865‚Äì1918) December 1917 events ","title":"1917 Sacramento Governor's Mansion bombing"},{"id":"53398442","text":"Melloina is a genus of baldlegged spiders that was first described by Paolo Marcello Brignoli in 1985. it contains only three species, found only in Panama and Venezuela: M. gracilis, M. rickwesti, and M. santuario.

Described in one account as a \\"fortress\\", it was designed for use by the president as a military headquarters during an emergency. Design According to the diary of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who toured the facility in 1959, Orange One can house a staff of 200 persons in two separate wings and is a \\"fortress ... hewn out of the rock\\". Bill Gulley has said Orange One can be reached by an elevator from Aspen Lodge, the president's quarters at Camp David, and that part of Orange One extends underneath the Aspen Lodge swimming pool. Gulley noted that, as of the mid 1970s, Orange One was no longer considered a primary command and control facility as its communications systems had not, at that time, been improved and it had not been updated to withstand attack by certain categories of weapons. History Orange One was first visited by a sitting president in the 1950s when Dwight D. Eisenhower inspected the facility while leading the exercise Operation Alert. In April 1961, then-former president Eisenhower returned to Camp David for consultations with John F. Kennedy on the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. According to former Associated Press reporter Dale Nelson, Kennedy inspected Orange One following Eisenhower's departure before helicoptering to his private estate, Glen Ora, in Middleburg, Virginia.

He was trained in Antwerp and also worked in Italy, France and England. In England he was court painter to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester.Huybrecht Beuckeleer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In 1997 the artist was identified with the artist known by the notname 'Monogrammist HB' and as a result more works have been attributed to him. Although the artist only left a small body of work, he played a role in the development of genre and still life painting in Northern Europe.Attribu√© a Huybrecht Beuckelaer, M√ªres, cerises, poires, melon et autres fruits, panais, pain, fromages et une gauffre, roemer, tazza et sali√®re sur une table drap√©e at Christie's Life Details about the life of the artist are scarce. Huybrecht Beuckeleer was born in Antwerp in a family of painters. His father Mattheus Beuckelaer was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1535.Josua Bruyn, Een portret van Pieter Aertsen en de Amsterdamse portretschilderkunst 1550-1600 met een postscriptum over Huybrecht Beuckelaer (alias Hubbert/Hubbard), in: Oud Holland Vol. 113, No. 3 (1999), pp. 107-136 Huybrecht is believed to have been the brother of Joachim Beuckelaer who was a prominent painter of kitchen and market scenes.Joachim Beuckelaer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His father's sister Kathelijne was married to Pieter Aertsen, a Dutch painter active in Antwerp who was best known for his market and kitchen scenes. The egg seller Huybrecht Beuckeleer likely studied initially with his father. He is presumed to have trained also in the workshop of his uncle Pieter Aertsen. By the early 1560s, Aertsen had left for Amsterdam. Huybrecht 's brother Joachim operated at that time a successful workshop in which he produced kitchen and market scenes. There is uncertainty about the role of Huybrecht in his brother's workshop. However it is clear that the brothers' early works were heavily influenced by Aertsen in style as well as subject matter.Huybrecht Beuckelaer, The first Passover feast at Sotheby's It is known that the artist collaborated with Antonis Mor for day wages just like his brother. There is evidence of extensive travel in the period 1567‚Äì68. Huybrecht was mentioned in Antwerp in January 1567. Not long thereafter he was said to be 'travelling in various foreign countries in order to see the land and learn the language, and to practise his trade as a painter and thus earn his living'. It has been suggested on stylistic grounds that he may have trained in Bronzino's workshop in Florence as early as the mid-1550s. There is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis. In September 1568 Huybrecht Beuckeleer had returned to Antwerp where he married a woman with whom he had a son. His wife was recorded as deceased in April 1569. He inherited a rent on a house from her. In 1574 there is a record of him sending from Bordeaux a letter to the mother of his first wife telling her that he is faring better there than in Antwerp. He was back in Antwerp in October 1577 when he sold the rent he had inherited from his first wife. He married a second time in 1577. His second wife was Susanna Key; the daughter of the painter Willem Key who had already died by that time. He became an independent master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke only in 1579. The artist was last mentioned in Antwerp in 1585. It is believed that around this time, which coincides with the Fall of Antwerp, he moved to England. Here he was likely active as a portrait artist. He probably worked for The Earl of Leicester. He was mentioned in a list of names of people from the Low Countries, probably from 1586. In the list he is referred to as \\"Hubert B√ºcheler (or Hubert Bucheler) in Greenwich\\". The Earl of Leicester who was possibly his last patron died in 1605. A picture maker by the name of Daniel Buckler mentioned in a list of foreign artists as having died in London in 1625 is believed to have been his son.Early Modern British Painters, c.1500-1640 Work =Rediscovery= The first Passover feast The art historian Johannes Sievers had identified a small group of works with certain stylistic idiosyncrasies and classified them under the notname the Monogrammist HB in 1911 (J. Sievers, Joachim Bueckeleer, in: Jahrbuch der preu√üischen Kunstsammlungen, 32, 1911, pp. 210‚Äì212).Huybrecht Bueckeleer, The Holy Family with Saint Anne at Dorotheum The work and artistic personality of the artist given this notname were first defined in 1976 by the art historian Detlev Kreidl in his analysis of the Prodigal Son Feasting with harlots (the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) and The kitchen maid and her helpers (in the same museum). The two works had been attributed over the years to both Joachim Beuckelaer and Aertsen.Detlev Kreidl, Joachim Beuckelaer und der Monogrammist HB, in: Oud Holland, Vol. 90, No. 3 (1976), published by Brill, pp. 162-183 The two paintings were found to bear the monogram HB and in 1997 infra-red reflectography conducted on The kitchen maid and her helpers revealed the signature 'Beuckler' and a date of 1570 or 1676 next to the already familiar monogram HB. Based on this discovery Kreidl was able to identify the 'Monogrammist HB' as Huybrecht Beuckeleer. The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) is another painting previously attributed to Joachim that was reattributed to Huybrecht. Only about half a dozen paintings have been attributed to Huybrecht Beuckeleer. His small output is likely attributable to the fact that he worked for others or in the workshop of other artists. Only a few of his works are clearly dated:The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) and The Holy Family with Saint Anne (sale Dorotheum, Vienna, 19 April 2016, lot 34) are both dated 1563. The kitchen maid and her helpers has a date of either 1570 or 1576. The subject matter of Huybrecht is similar to that of his brother Joachim and Aertsen and includes kitchen and market scenes as well as some religious compositions and portraits. A still life has also been attributed to the artist. =Style characteristics= Sievers had in 1911 already identified the main differences between the works of Huybrecht (whom he knew as the Monogrammist HB) and his brother Joachim. The distinctive traits identified by Sievers point to a greater realism and naturalness in Huybrecht's work when compared to that of his brother. Sievers found Huybrecht's treatment of the human body to display a higher degree of three- dimensionality and detail and his figures to be more individualized in the treatment of the head. Huybrecht further adopted a freer treatment of certain details such as the hair and beards. His figures are placed in a more relaxed arrangement and their gestures and movements appear to be more fluent and naturalistic. Detlev Kreindl expanded on Sievers' earlier conclusions in 1976. Kreidl highlighted that Huybrecht's figures are more statuesque and sculptural in handling. Kreidl also posited a similarity between Huybrecht's works and portraits from the circle of the Florentine painter Bronzino. It is precisely the sculptural treatment of his figures and the crisp modelling of the faces, which are regarded as evidence of the influence of the Florentine master. Kreidl suggests that possibly he trained in Bronzino's workshop as early as the mid-1550s. On the basis of these characteristics Kreidl reattributed two portraits (art market) previously given to Santi di Tito to Huybrecht. The kitchen maid and her helpers In their energetic and bold drawing of the main outlines of their compositions the brothers also show their common artistic background. Huybrecht's handling of various textures and patterns also suggests the influence of Anthonis Mor, with whom he is believed to have collaborated in the early 1560s in Antwerp. A Portrait of a man in the Mauritshuis in The Hague is signed and dated 'Mor 1561'. It is generally believed that only the head was painted by Mor while the rest was finished by an assistant in his workshop. It has been suggested that that assistant could be Huybrecht Beuckelaer because of his particular skill in rendering fabrics. The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) illustrates Huybrecht's technique. In this work he employed a formula already used by Aertsen in the early 1550s. It is characterised by the high viewpoint, which allows every aspect of the scene, in this case, the Passover Feast, to be explained in detail. The scale of the composition is relatively large and the figures are almost lifelike positioned in the immediate foreground. These traits clearly show his indebtedness to the colorful naturalism of Aertsen's later works of this type. The scene is dominated by the large figures who are distributed on all levels of the pictorial space and connected by eye contact and individual gestures. Huybrechts demonstrates in this picture that he could give a more elegant and idealized treatment of figures than Aertsen's or his brother Joachim. =Market and kitchen scenes= The market and kitchen scenes showing the lavish produce available in Antwerp at the time have often been interpreted as showcasing the prosperity of Antwerp, the then most important trading port in the Netherlands.Joachim Beuckelaer: het markt- en keukenstuk in de Nederlanden, 1550-1650, Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Gent, Gemeentekrediet, 1986 Others see the compositions as satirical and bearing a moralistic intention.Margaret A. Sullivan, Aertsen's Kitchen and Market Scenes: Audience and Innovation in Northern Art, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 81, No. 2 (Jun., 1999), pp. 236‚Äì266, at JSTOR Some commentators have pointed to the erotic tension between the various actors in the scenes. For instance, the composition The kitchen maid and her helpers shows a cook standing in front of a fireplace, while she holds a big cabbage under her left arm and her right hand points to a chicken on a spit. A kitchen boy sitting at her feet on a bench with a dog on his lap is turning the spit. With his right hand he points to a young kitchen helper behind the kitchen maid. This young helper is placing a pot on a kitchen counter and is returning the boy's gaze. The kitchen interior is unmistakably dominated by erotic tension between the kitchen boy and the older kitchen maid. The big dog in the lap of the kitchen boy refers to his sexual desire while various comical and farcical foods, such as the rotisserie chicken, the cauldron of porridge, the cucumbers and the large cabbage under the arm of the kitchen maid indicate that she is available. In The egg seller another popular theme of Flemish genre art is depicted: that of the unequal love between an older man and a younger woman.Kwak, Z. S. M. (2014). ‚ÄòProeft de kost en kauwtse met uw‚Äô oogen‚Äô. Beeldtraditie, betekenis en functie van het Noord-Nederlandse keukentafereel (ca. 1590-1650) His Prodigal son feasting with harlots is not only a kitchen style scene but also falls in the category of the 'loose company' or 'merry company' painting genre developed earlier in the century by Jan Sanders van Hemessen. Beuckeleer depicts the subject in the form of a rendezvous between an elegantly dressed young couple sitting at a table. On the table a lavish still life is displayed, adding to the impression of upscale taste. The elegant man has clearly started his wooing earlier by playing the lute at his side. However, the actions of the servants makes clear that the true nature of the setting is that of a brothel rather than that of an upscale dwelling. Like Jan Sanders van Hemessen did in his earlier treatment of this subject, Beuckeleer included in his picture another scene from the biblical story of the prodigal son: in the background on the left the prodigal son is seen eating pig swill after he has squandered his inheritance and fallen on hard times. =Still life= Still life A still life referred to as Blackberries, cherries, pears, melons and other fruits, parsnips, bread, cheese and a waffle, roemer, tazza and salt cellar on a draped table (At Christie's on 16 October 2013 in Paris lot 69) has been attributed to Huybrecht Beuckeleer on the basis of the similarities with the still life included in the Prodigal son feasting with harlots of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels. This still life makes clear that Huybrecht Beuckeleer played a role in the development of the genre of still life painting in the 16th century. In its skilfully organized and balanced composition this still life shows him to be independent from Aertsen's models. This still life prefigures the later works of Floris van Dyck (circa 1575-1651) and Nicolaes Gillis (1595-around 1632).

John Reid and partners, on the advice of William Light, recently turned land agent, selected a property at a junction of NorthPara and South Para rivers. They engaged surveyor William Jacob to lay out the township now known as Gawler and divided the rest among themselves. Reid's portion of , which he named \\"Clonlea\\", was on the north side of the North Para. Among Reid's partners were fellow passengers Henry Dundas Murray and Stephen King, father of Stephen King Jr., and Henry Johnson, a proxy for London banker Edmund Jerningham. Streets in Gawler were named for these pioneers. :John Reid failed as an agriculturist: labour costs brought about by the gold rush to Victoria and the copper mines in Burra and elsewhere, coupled with poor prices, stretched his finances to breaking point, and he sold the mortgage on the property to William Paxton (Australian businessman) the chemist of Hindley Street. Eventually Paxton resumed the property, leaving the homestead and for the Reids' use. The children were brought up at \\"Clonlea\\", Gawler. Three of the brothers went in for pastoral property management: William took over Tolarno station on the Darling River, which he managed from the mid 1850s to the 1890s. Ross Reid and R.J.B. Reid initially had a share in the business; R.J.B. Reid left the partnership in 1868. Ross Reid was managing Mount Murchison station until at least 1866, then it was taken over by Dean & Laughton, and Ross joined William at Tolarno. Original owner Ross T. Reid, substantially renovated c. 1890 by (unrelated) J. S. Reid, to resemble \\"Romsdal\\", Toorak, Victoria. Ross was a keen racegoer and owned several winning horses, notably Pride of the Hills. He purchased a large block at Magill, in the foothills of Adelaide, and there built a fine mansion which he named after Rostrevor, a seaside resort close to his birthplace. They owned Tarcoon Station, on the Bogan River, from 1870 to 1872, when it was sold to F. H. Randell. Tolarno station was one of the largest and most successful sheep stations on the Darling, shearing up to 250,000 sheep a year. While Tolarno was in the hands of the Reid brothers the only practical freight communication was by steamboat on the Murray-Darling system to ports such as Echuca, Mannum and Goolwa. In 1875, the Reid brothers and Hugh King purchased the Jane Eliza from captains Davies and Dorward, and also had an interest in steamers Gem, Jupiter, Menindie and Shannon. Thousands of tonnes of wool were shipped and the Reid brothers made a fortune. Tolarno was in the 1880s badly infested with rabbits, and was used as a test bed for Dr. Butcher's experiments with \\"Tintinallogy disease\\", which proved to be a false hope. In 1887 he put \\"Rostrevor\\" on the market; it was purchased by Melbourne businessman J. S. Reid (no relation). A prolonged drought hit the country in the 1890s, with a considerable loss of stock. Several banks failed and a country-wide recession hit Australia, with consequent loss of sales and low prices. He retired to Glenelg, South Australia, where in his home, \\"St Leonards\\", he died aged 82, and was buried in the family vault, Magill.

He was also an early American entomologist and a regional specialist in the study of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Biography Morris was born on November 14, 1803 in York, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of nine children born to John Samuel Gottlieb Morris and Barbara Myers Morris. His father had emigrated from Germany in 1776 to fight in the American Revolution. His mother was from Baltimore County, Maryland. After the war, the senior Morris settled in York, married Barbara Myers and became a successful physician. Both parents were devout members of the Lutheran Church. Morris was baptized on January 8, 1804 in York's Christ Lutheran Church.Kurtz (1994)Kurtz (1996) When Morris was five, his father died, leaving a substantial fortune to his wife and children. Morris' oldest brother, Charles, stepped in and became the boy's guardian. Morris studied first at York Academy, attended Princeton and then graduated from Dickinson College in 1823. He demonstrated a strong aptitude for language and became fluent in German, Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew. After graduation at the age of twenty, Morris decided to become a Lutheran minister. For two years he studied with Samuel Simon Schmucker, an influential but controversial Lutheran religious leader. He then studied at the Presbyterian Princeton Theological Seminary before finishing his training in 1826 at the new Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. In October 1827, Morris was ordained in the Lutheran ministry and began serving as pastor of the First English Lutheran Church in Baltimore. Shortly after settling in Baltimore, Morris married Eliza Hay, member of a prominent New York family. They went on to have ten children, of whom four daughters survived to adulthood.Guide to the Morris, J.G. & Morris-Hay Family Diaries, Gettysburg College When Morris joined the clergy, Lutheranism faced an internal struggle between liberals who sought to align with mainstream American Protestantism and conservative German immigrants who wished to maintain their traditions and language. As pastor of First English for more than thirty years, Morris was a leading proponent of progressive, English-speaking Lutheranism in Baltimore. He also participated in inter-denominational efforts and became president of the Baltimore Ministerial Association. When he left his parish in 1860, he continued to serve on a part-time basis at St. Mark's and Third English, both in Baltimore. Morris was also active on state and national levels, serving seven times as president of the Maryland Synod and twice as president of the General Synod. By 1860 Morris had served as pastor for 33 years and felt the need for a career change. He resigned his position and was appointed trustee for the new Peabody Institute. Later that same year he became the institution's first librarian, charged with building a collection that covered \\"every department of knowledge\\". Morris quickly put together a catalog of 50,000 volumes he wanted to obtain for the new library. By the time he left the library in 1867, he had acquired 20,000 titles. Even after his departure, the catalog continued to provide guidance for book acquisitions until 1916.Kurtz (1997) In addition to his religious work, Morris had a keen interest in science, education, and history. He was one of the earliest American entomologists to specialize in the study of butterflies. In 1842 he became a founding member of the Entomological Society of Pennsylvania, the first society in America devoted to entomology. In 1846 he toured Europe, meeting with European entomologists and viewing the insect collections at some of the major museums.Sorensen (1995) In 1860 Morris published his Catalogue of the Described Lepidoptera of North America and followed with the Synopsis of the Described Lepidoptera of North America in 1862. These were the first catalogs of American butterflies written by an American.Leach (2013) Morris also wrote and lectured extensively on the relationship between science and religion. Unlike many of his colleagues in American entomology, he never accepted Darwinism and instead remained a supporter of Georges Cuvier's catastrophism. For many years Morris maintained a close relationship with the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and its sister institution, Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College). He was appointed director of the seminary in 1828 and eventually served ten terms for a total of 48 years. He participated in the establishment of the college in 1832 and served on the board of trustees for 54 years. He taught zoology and natural history at the college and lectured for many years at the seminary. In 1844 Morris organized the Linnaean Association, one of the first college natural history societies in the country. Morris also established the Lutherville Female Seminary (and the town of Lutherville) in 1853. In 1851 Morris was elected to membership in the Maryland Historical Society, an organization that suited his scholarly interest in history. Over the next four decades he served the society in a number of different roles and was elected president in 1895. One of his chief contributions to the Society was the effort he led to expand and improve both the library and the natural history collections. By 1885 the library held over 25,000 volumes and the museum held a substantial collection representing the flora, fauna, and geology of Maryland. In 1886 Morris used his influence to encourage the creation of the Society for the History of the Germans in Maryland. Morris was elected president of the new society, a position he held until his death. Morris died on October 10, 1895. Works Morris was a prolific writer who published hundreds of books, pamphlets and articles on a number of subjects, including Martin Luther, the Reformation, German history, Maryland history, and the relation between science and religion. A few of his publications include: *1838 Geology and Revelation *1844 Necessities and Blessings of the Reformation *1846 Natural History as Applied to Farming and Gardening *1855 Martin Behaim, the German Astronomer *1860 Catalogue of the Described Lepidoptera of North America *1862 Synopsis of the Described Lepidoptera of North America *1874 The Lords of Baltimore *1882 Luther at Wartburg: A Reformation Story of 1521 *1896 Life Reminiscences of an Old Lutheran Minister Notes References   1803 births 1895 deaths American entomologists American Lutheran clergy Peabody Institute faculty Dickinson College alumni Gettysburg College faculty American librarians ","title":"John Gottlieb Morris"},{"id":"53398750","text":"Christian Garros (February 17, 1920, Paris ‚Äì August 23, 1988, Rouen) was a French jazz drummer and bandleader.

Illusions Five of Sugihara's illusions have won awards at the annual Best Illusion of the Year Contest: *In 2010, his illusion \\"Impossible Motion: Magnet Slopes\\" won first place in the contest. This illusion uses forced perspective to show marbles seemingly rolling up ramps. *In 2013 he won first place again (with Jun Ono and Akiyasu Tomoeda) for \\"Rotation Generated by Translation\\", an illusion that uses Moir√© patterns to create the appearance of rotation from objects moving only by translation.. *In 2015 his \\"Ambiguous Garage Roof\\" won second place. The illusion appears to show a convex roof surface that is reflected in a mirror to a corrugated zig-zag shape. Neither of these appearances accurately describes the true shape of the roof.. *In 2016 he won second place again for \\"Ambiguous Cylinder Illusion\\", which shows a stack of cylinders that from one point of view appear to have a circular cross-section, and from another point of view appear rectangular. *In 2018 he won his first place for his \\"Triply Ambiguous Object\\", which shows a rectangular object with three different interpretations when seen from three special viewpoints.. His interest in illusions stems from his research in the 1980s on automating the analysis of perspective drawings,. which he published in the 1986 MIT Press book Machine Interpretation of Line Drawings. When he asked his computer system to interpret impossible objects such as the ones in the art of M. C. Escher, he discovered that they could be interpreted as drawings of real objects with unexpected shapes. Other research Sugihara's research also includes the study of Voronoi diagrams.

Ambrosie played Canadian football professionally as an offensive guard for the CFL's Calgary Stampeders, Toronto Argonauts, and Edmonton Eskimos. He was selected with the second overall pick in the 1985 CFL Draft by the Stampeders. Over the course of a nine-season career, he played in 142 professional games and became a Grey Cup champion. Ambrosie played college football at the University of Manitoba.  Early career  Ambrosie played college football for the Manitoba Bisons as an offensive lineman. In 1984, he was named an All-Canadian. He was also a Canada West All-Star in 1983 and 1984. In a February 1985 article in The Globe and Mail, it was stated that a recent poll of CFL teams listed Ambrosie as one of the top nine players available for the 1985 CFL Draft. Ambrosie received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the school.  Professional career  = Calgary Stampeders = Ambrosie was selected in the first round of the 1985 CFL Draft by the Calgary Stampeders with the second overall pick. The Stampeders used Ambrosie in their lineup immediately. Despite a late season injury due to torn ligaments in his ankle, Ambrosie played in 13 regular season games in his rookie season and was named the Stampeders' nominee for rookie of the year. Ambrosie remained in the lineup in 1986, playing in 17 regular season games. = Toronto Argonauts = After playing four games for the Stampeders in 1987, Ambrosie was traded to the Toronto Argonauts for a second-round draft pick. He quickly earned a place on the Argonauts' roster, playing against the Stampeders in his first week after changing between the two teams. The Argonauts eventually promoted Ambrosie to start as a right guard. Ambrosie finished the season with 13 games played for the Argonauts. He played in the 75th Grey Cup, making a key block to allow running back Gill Fenerty to score a touchdown late in the first half. The Argonauts went on to lose the game 36‚Äì38. The offensive line of the Argonauts dealt with injuries for much of the 1988 season. Ambrosie injured his knee during training camp, while other Argonaut offensive linemen suffered from a variety of ankle, groin, knee, and back injuries. By late July, Ambrosie had recovered, but he was the only healthy starting member of the offensive line that year. Despite the medical setbacks, both the press and the Argonauts coaching staff praised the offensive line, with the Toronto Star crediting the unit for \\"establish[ing] Toronto as one of the best running teams in the Canadian Football League\\". In September, Ambrosie missed three games due to a back injury and he played through an ankle injury in October. The continued injury issues did not affect the offensive line's success on the field, as they finished with the second fewest sacks allowed in the CFL. Ambrosie finished the regular season with 15 games played. The Argonauts went on to lose in the East Final to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. = Edmonton Eskimos = In June 1989, Ambrosie was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos to obtain defensive lineman Branko Vincic. The Argonauts had not originally planned to trade Ambrosie, but he requested to be traded to a team closer to where his wife worked. Ambrosie played in all 18 regular season games for the Eskimos in 1989 as the Eskimos established a 16‚Äì2 record. By adding to the Argonauts 14 wins the previous season, Ambrosie set a new CFL record as the player with the most wins in two consecutive seasons. Despite being described as \\"one of the strongest teams in CFL history\\", the Eskimos lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 32‚Äì21 in the West Final to end their season. Ambrosie played in 13 games for the Eskimos in 1990, missing time due to a knee injury. He played in all 18 regular season games the following year. In 1991, the Eskimos finished first in the West Division but lost the West Final to the Stampeders. In 1992, Ambrosie played in all regular season games as the Eskimos went 13‚Äì5 before losing in the West Finals to the Stampeders for the second consecutive season. The Eskimos considered there to be \\"no safe jobs\\" on the roster following several years of playoff losses, but Ambrosie earned a starting role on the team to start the 1993 season. A knee injury kept Ambrosie out of the lineup for most of September, and he finished with 13 games played in 1993. The Eskimos met the Stampeders in the West Final for the fourth consecutive season and won 29‚Äì15 to break their playoff losing streak. Ambrosie helped the Eskimos win the 81st Grey Cup over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 33‚Äì23 to earn his only championship ring. = Retirement = Following his Grey Cup win, the future of Ambrosie's football career was uncertain. His persistent knee injuries had required multiple surgeries over the years. Ambrosie put off another serious surgery on his left knee during the 1993 season to remain with the team through their Grey Cup victory. After he underwent his fourth knee surgery during the offseason, Ambrosie retired from professional football.  Administrative roles  By 1992, Ambrosie took over as the secretary of the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA). He played a role in monitoring the 1992 NHL strike as the CFLPA and the CFL renegotiated their collective bargaining agreement that year. Ambrosie was also part of the CFLPA board that oversaw the CFL's expansion into the United States. During the expansion, Ambrosie took a strong stance against lowering the import ratio which requires each team to carry a certain number of Canadian players. He also took issue with a proposed expansion or dispersal draft intended to be held in early 1993 to provide players for the San Antonio Texans and Sacramento Gold Miners. The CFLPA and Ambrosie threatened legal action over the import ratio issue, but no legal action came to pass. On June 28, 2017, the Winnipeg Free Press reported that Ambrosie would soon be named the 14th CFL commissioner, succeeding Jeffrey Orridge. The move was officially announced seven days later. He is the first Canadian-born CFL commissioner since Tom Wright left in 2006, and the first to have played in the league since Larry Smith left the position in 1997.  Business career  After retiring from football, Ambrosie became the North American head of sales at HSBC Securities. In May 2004, Ambrosie joined AGF Management Ltd. as their head of sales and marketing. The president of the company reportedly hired him to \\"shake things up\\". Ambrosie's leadership brought several changes to AGF Management Ltd., including new fund managers and the launch of new products. In June 2006, Ambrosie was appointed president of AGF Funds Inc. Due to another managerial change in 2008, Ambrosie left the firm. Ambrosie served as CEO of Accretive 360 Inc. from 2010 to 2012, before joining investment firm MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier as president and CEO.

The building used to be one of Campania‚Äôs Bourbon royal residences and since 1927 this residence has hosted the museum. History In 1815, Ferdinand IV of Bourbon bought for his wife Lucia Migliaccio, duchess of Floridia, the mansion of the Prince Giuseppe Caracciolo di Torella on the hill of Vomero. In her honour the villa was called after her Flordiana. Over time, the King bought more land around the original mansion and the architect Antonio Niccolini was given the privilege of restoring the old structure. Between 1817 and 1819 the villa got its neoclassical style, while the gardens were remodelled by the director of the Botanical Gardens of Naples, Mr Friedrich Dehnardt. The park was embellished with 150 plant species, among which you can find pine trees, plane trees and a rich collection of camellias. By the end of the restoration project, the Villa Floridiana comprised two buildings, Villa Lucia and villa Flor√¨dia, a small open theatre, a little Ionic semi-circular temple, fake ruins and greenhouses in neoclassical style. When the sovereigns died, the Villa Floridiana passed on to the heirs of the Duchess‚Äô first marriage. Later, Villa Lucia and part of the gardens were sold to Count Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, thus becoming his residence in Naples. In 1919, the Floridiana was bought by the state and was transformed into a museum. The first exhibition was the ceramics collection received from Maria Spinelli di Scalea, niece of Placido Sangro, Duke of Martina. So, the Museum was named after him. Placido di Sangro, comes from the Neapolitan noble family ‚ÄúDi sanguine‚Äù, resident in ‚Äúsedile di Nilo‚Äù, but having land also in Aquila, Benevento, Lucera e Troia. Placido di Sangro lived during the 16th century and worked as an ambassador for Charles V. He was a scholar and got appointed ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù of the Academy of Sireni or Sereni attended by distinguished aristocrats of the time. Placido di Sangro was received by Emperor Charles V, as Ambassador of Neapolitans. After the interview, the emperor, fearing to lose the Kingdom of Naples for the multiplication of riots that caused quite a few losses in the Spanish Army, proclaimed a pardon for rebels and decided that in Naples there would be no Inquisition. The Kingdom of Naples became a happy and safe place for the people persecuted by the Inquisition of the Church. As a consequence, the family of Eleonora de Fonseca Pimentel, who had escaped from Portugal and Rome, moved to Naples to be free from religious persecution. The rich collection of items, collected during the second half of the 19th century by Placido de Sangro, duke of Martina and given to the city of Naples in 1911 by his grandson, the earl of Marsi Placido de Sangro, well reflects the climate of enthusiasm and of renewed interest in the so-called minor arts, which spread over Europe at that time. The duke of Martina, estimator and connoisseur of every type of artefacts, bought items from the main European cities gathering, starting from the second half of the 19th century, an impressive collection of chinaware, majolica and minor artistic artefacts made of glass, leather, coral and ivory. Itinerary The visit of the museum starts from the vestibule, where the visitors can see the paintings of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon and of the Duchess Floridia, and leads them to the other floors through the large side staircase. The collections of the museum have been expanded in 1978, when an heir of the duke of Martina, Riccardo de Sangro, posthumously donated a collection of 580 items, including porcelain, majolica and furniture belonging to the original collection of Placido de Sangro. More recently, another donation from De Felice enriched the museum with tortoiseshell artefacts. Today, the National Museum of ceramics Duca di Martina, with its 6,000 oriental and occidental items on display, hosts one of the biggest collections in Italy of decorative art from the 12th to the 19th century. The museum is on three levels: ground floor, basement and first floor. =Ground Floor= Entering the villa, on the ground floor, visitors can appreciate some porcelain and sketches made by Neapolitan artists of the 2nd and 18th centuries. In the vestibule, there is a picture of the duke of Martina by Salvatore Postiglione. In this area, visitors can also find Renaissance and Baroque Majolica, precious pictures, furniture, caskets, 15th to 18th century glass and crystal items, as well as artefacts made of ivory, glaze, tortoiseshell, coral and bronze dating back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. =Basement= Majolica is important in the collection of the Duca di Martina. It is on display in the basement of the museum and includes Renaissance majolica from Deruta, Gubbio, Faenza and Palermo, and 17th century majolica from Castelli, in Abruzzo. In this area, the visitors can see glass from Venice and glaze from Limoges dating back to the 15th and 16th century, artefacts made of leather, caskets, tobacco tins and corals. The museum is particularly proud to host the most important oriental art collection in Italy, comprising 1,200 items of porcelain, bronze, jade and glaze. The Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) chinaware collections, together with the Japanese Kakiemon and Imari collections are astounding. =First Floor= The first floor of the museum is entirely dedicated to European porcelain. The Saxon collection of Meissen, the Bourbon collection of Capodimonte and the collection of the Marquis Carlo Ginori a Doccia stand out for the quality and number of items on display. In this area, the visitors can also see French porcelain from Chantilly, Rouen, Saint-Cloud, Mennency and Sevr√®s. The rooms follow Roman numbers and go from room XV to room XXVIII.

She was married first to Howard Head and then to Dr. Stanley Morse Jr. and lived in South Carolina. She was also a mentor to Pat Conroy. Instead of graduating college, she became a freelance writer at age 28. She died at age 52 of a cerebral aneurysm on May 7, 1968.Lauderdale, David (24 October 2015). Meet Pat Conroy's 'first novelist', The Island Packet Even though Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones was marketed for young adults, Ann Head did not consider herself a young adult writer, and wrote the book for an adult audience. However, because the novel sold better to young adults, it is now considered part of the genre of Young Adult Literature. In 1971 the novel was adapted to a made-for-TV movie by the same name starring Desi Arnaz Jr. and Christopher Norris. Synopsis July Greher Jones tells the story of the first year of her marriage to her high school boyfriend, the football hero Boswell Johnson \\"Bo Jo\\" Jones. When the story begins, 16-year-old July and 17-year-old Bo Jo are high school seniors preparing for college. The upper-middle-class Grehers plan for July to attend an elite college; Bo Jo's working-class family hopes that he will get a football scholarship and be the first in his family to attend college. July's parents do not approve of her spending so much time with Bo Jo, and try to get her to date other boys. Although July is not certain of her feelings for Bo Jo, she likes him more than other boys she has dated, and the couple continues to see each other exclusively. One night, after consuming alcohol at a party where Bo Jo's former girlfriend Alicia is present and makes July feel jealous, Bo Jo and July end up having sex. July learns she is pregnant just as Bo Jo receives his letter of acceptance and football scholarship from Georgia Tech. The couple hide the pregnancy from their parents, secretly drive across the state line, and get married. Eventually they inform their parents, causing Bo Jo's parents to throw him out of the house and July's parents to threaten a forced annulment and an illegal abortion. Both sets of parents reluctantly accept the marriage. The couple are forced to leave school, and live for a disastrous short time with Bo Jo's parents, who blame July for ruining Bo Jo's college opportunity. July's parents then arrange an apartment for the couple and a job for Bo Jo at July's father's bank. The only truly supportive adult is July's grandmother. July and Bo Jo soon find themselves missing their old life of school, football, and social events, and begin to bicker with each other and spend time apart. Lonely and bored, July begins writing to a Princeton student named Horace, who, unlike Bo Jo, is from her social class and shares July's interests in music and literature. Horace lives out of town and is unaware that July is now married with a baby on the way, and July avoids telling him, even when his letters begin to show a romantic interest. July also meets and bonds with another young teenage bride, Lou, who is an aspiring singer and actress recently married to an older man. July and Lou's friendship comes to an end when Lou becomes unexpectedly pregnant and, unlike July, decides to have an illegal abortion without telling her husband. Lou's husband finds out and angrily hits Lou, who leaves him and moves to New York, where she becomes a nightclub singer and the mistress of a wealthy man. July realizes that unlike Lou, she does want her baby, which is beginning to move in her womb. Bo Jo meanwhile has sought solace by spending more time out drinking with his old friends Charlie and Alicia, whom July does not like, especially since Alicia still seems to be romantically pursuing Bo Jo. After Bo Jo and July argue, he leaves the house and later comes home with a lipstick smudge on his neck, causing July to suspect him of cheating on her with Alicia. Two months before July is due, she confronts Alicia and afterwards goes into early labor. The premature baby dies a few days after birth. Bo Jo and July's parents now suggest that the couple should split up and resume the lives they had before, with July attending a boarding school near Princeton and Bo Jo getting his football scholarship back. But Bo Jo and July realize that their shared grief over the lost baby has brought them closer together, and now they are truly in love and do not want to break up. Three years later, Bo Jo is attending college, living in the married students' housing with his wife July, who works in the bursar's office to help pay their expenses.  Characters *July Greher- July is the sixteen-year-old protagonist of the novel, which is told from her first person point of view. She is a senior in high school and really enjoys the subjects of English literature and Biology. She planned to attend a girls‚Äô college in New England after graduation, but the unplanned pregnancy and marriage interrupt those plans. She had never ‚Äúgone steady‚Äù with anyone before, and neither she nor Bo Jo were considered ‚Äúoffbeat‚Äù or had anything ‚Äúway out‚Äù about them. They never intended to have premarital sex, and even feel ashamed for weeks afterward (before finding out about the pregnancy). She believes that marriage is a serious commitment despite her rushing into it, and also believes that marriage is worth preserving and implies certain promises. She also is strongly opposed to abortion and giving up the baby for adoption. She feels isolated from her family and friends after her marriage to Bo Jo because they (1) don‚Äôt have the shared experience and (2) don‚Äôt believe the marriage will/should last. *Bo Jo Jones- Boswell Johnson Jones is July's long-term boyfriend and eventual husband, as well as father of the child. He is seventeen and his best quality is his persistence no matter the activity. He is a private person who mostly keeps his thoughts to himself, but works really hard in school in order to get the grades necessary for acceptance to a university. They don‚Äôt have a lot of money and Bo Jo will be the first of his family to attend college. He is the school's star halfback whose family is banking his receiving an athletic scholarship to a university. Before their unplanned, intimate night on the beach, neither had considered their relationship serious. However, after they slip up, July tries to break up with Bo Jo and he tells her that he doesn‚Äôt want to date anyone else and she says likewise. He promises not to ‚Äúfall off the deep end‚Äù ever again, and they try to continue dating. After July informs Bo Jo that she is pregnant, he asserts that they should get married. Bo Jo struggles in his interactions with July and learning to be married, as well as his lost educational opportunities, but does his best to provide for July and their expected baby. *Mary Ann Simmons- Mary Anne is July's best friend that is described as naive and pure despite a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù upbringing. She has a long term boyfriend, Alan, who she eventually marries at the end of the novel. Her and Alan's relationship is set up as a foil against July and Bo Jo's marriage. Not only do Mary Anne and Alan love each other, but they follow a proper timeline in their relationship and engage in age-appropriate activities. Mary Anne's family is complicated because her mother supposedly has a new husband and family in Peru who Mary Anne never sees, and Mary Anne helps to raise the dozen ‚Äúorphan‚Äù siblings her father has collected from multiple marriages and divorces with women who leave all their children behind (whether fathered by Mr. Simmons or not). Mary Anne is the same social class as July and refers to each successive stepmother as ‚ÄúMother _,‚Äù which to those unaware of the situation would make it seem like she was referring to a nun. *Horace - Horace is a nephew of one of Mr. and Mrs. Greher's friends whose family comes to visit with July's family right before July and Bo Jo are able to tell her parents about their marriage. July's mother tries to get July to take Horace out on the town to give him something to do, while Bo Jo is right there. He is a sophomore at the university and plans to attend Princeton. They enjoy sophisticated conversation together and Horace eventually writes to July. Hurt by Bo Jo's emotional distance and their constant fighting, and lonely because of her isolation from friends and family, July writes Horace as a pen pal. She deliberately writes about anything besides her marriage, signs the letters with her maiden name, and has them delivered to her parents‚Äô home. After a while, July and Bo Jo reach a level of solidarity in their marriage but July still struggles to write Horace off. Eventually Horace basically confesses his love to July in a letter that is intercepted by Mrs. Greher, who is upset because Horace's aunt called, wondering about the correspondence. July writes back that she never intended to lead Horace on in that way and that she enjoyed the friendship. Horace responds after the baby is born and dead, and the couple is facing forced separation. He says that he is still interested in pursuing July should she ever find herself ‚Äúunattached.‚Äù Horace represents ‚Äòwhat could have been‚Äô had July not gotten pregnant and married. He is of her same social and economic standing and much more intellectual and sophisticated than Bo Jo. July decidedly rejects this option with her and Bo Jo's decision to stay together. Horace is in many ways representative of all July's parents wanted for her, and opportunities she could not have because of getting pregnant as a teenager. *Charlie Sanders- Bo Jo's Best friend who is considered to be wild but \\"quiet\\" about it. He is portrayed to believe that the world is his oyster. He throws parties out of town and July's parents are not found of him. July doesn't like Charlie very much either but would never say anything to Bo Jo as they are very good friends and she pretended to like Charlie in order to ease Bo Jo's mind when they first started dating. *Tommy Ryan and Julius Spence- Boys that July has dated before but views more like brothers then significant others. *Alicia Helms- Alicia is Bo Jo's ex- girlfriend who moved out of town but attends the same social events. Alicia's presence within the group at prom (along with some champagne slipped into the punch) motivated July and Bo Jo to go to the beach alone after the party rather than stay with the group. At first Bo Jo seems uninterested in Alicia, but Alicia aggressively pursues Bo Jo after he and July marry. After July and Bo Jo verbally fight, Bo Jo feels hurt and sometimes spends time with Charlie and Alicia in the aftermath of his fights with July. One night Bo Jo comes home after a fight and has a lipstick smudge on his neck, which July is sure came from Alicia. Two months before July is due she has an upsetting encounter with Alicia and afterwards goes into labor. *Rodney Blue- is the nice guy who only the desperate teens date. *Lou Consuela- Lou is set up as another foil against July. She is seventeen years old and married to a twenty-seven-year- old horse trainer. She and July become friends one day at the supermarket and bond over being both young and married. July feels that her old friends her age can no longer relate to her, and Lou doesn‚Äôt really get along with the wives of her husband, Nick's, older friends. Lou dreams of becoming a singer and actress and requires Nick to promise her that opportunity upon agreeing to marry him. However, Lou gets pregnant and blames it on Nick because he wanted to have unplanned (unprotected) sex on a day vacation. Lou thinks that having a child would ruin any chance of her becoming a star and has an illegal abortion in secret that she has to take out a loan in order to cover the cost. Nick wants children, finds out about the abortion, and is furious with Lou in response. Lou packs up and moves to New York. She writes to July to explain what happened and how she is doing. While July sometimes regrets her lost opportunities, she would never follow Lou's choices. July may not have wanted the baby at first and only acted how seemed necessary, but decides that she does want the baby when she can feel the life inside of her and compares her own experience with Lou's. *Mr. and Mrs Greher- Mr. and Mrs. Greher are July's parents. Mr. Greher works in a bank where they are firmly upper-middle class and have a good reputation in the community. Mrs. Greher was brought up in high society and cares very much about propriety. They live in the established side of town and can afford what they consider the very best. Before July and Bo Jo marry, Mr. and Mrs. Greher do not like Bo Jo very much and encourage July to spend less time with him and more time with varied groups of friends. Finding out about the marriage and the baby shocks Mr. and Mrs. Greher, and they feel that they have not only failed July as parents but that July is deliberately trying to hurt them. They would prefer to have July give up the baby for adoption and have the marriage annulled, not only because they disapprove of Bo Jo (being from a different class) but because the marriage limits July's own social and educational opportunities. Mr. Greher does offer Bo Jo a job at the bank (which he accepts) in order to cover the newlyweds‚Äô costs of living and pregnancy expenses. They also secure a private apartment above an acquaintance's garage for the newlyweds, which allows them some autonomy and privacy. *Mr. and Mrs. Jones- Mr. Jones is a contract engineer and the family is comparatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù to both middle class and the community at large. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Jones, nor their other two children, attended a university and they have high hopes for Bo Jo to gain an education so that he can secure a better, easier life for himself. Because they are newly established as lower-middle class, they cannot afford their children's college expenses. Previous to July and Bo Jo's wedding, Mr. and Mrs. Jones hadn‚Äôt even been keeping track of who their son was dating. When they find out about the marriage and pregnancy they are absolutely livid because it means that even after all of Bo Jo's hard work to get good grades and secure an athletic scholarship, he won‚Äôt be able to utilize it. They kick him out of the house when informed of the marriage, but allow the couple to stay with them after a couple days past. This proves to be disastrous as they are constantly, verbally reminding July that she ruined Bo Jo's life and hovering over their every action. Mrs. Jones tries to teach July some domestic skills but July often fails at these. They also won‚Äôt allow the newlyweds to sleep in the same room while staying in their home. Mr. and Mrs. Jones also do not like Mr. and Mrs. Greher and act very antagonistically toward them upon any forced interaction. *Grandma Louisa Conduit Greher - July's Grandmother is very proper but only snobbish about the ‚Äúright things,‚Äù according to July. She cares about people being ‚Äúopen minded.‚Äù She likes to drive her car like a skilled racecar drivier and lives in the nice home her husband left behind after he died, but took down all of the pictures of his high-class ancestors because she didn‚Äôt know them. When July's parents force July and Bo Jo to undergo a second marriage ceremony for propriety's sake, Grandmother Greher attends the ceremony at the church and afterwards gifts July four slim gold bracelets linked together by a gold chain with ‚Äúfaith,‚Äù ‚Äúforgiveness,‚Äù ‚Äúhumor,‚Äù and ‚Äúeternal vigilance‚Äù engraved on each one. She encourages July to strive for these qualities in her own marriage because July and Bo Jo don‚Äôt have love to rely on. Grandmother Greher is the only one to accept July and Bo Jo's marriage, as well as Bo Jo himself, and becomes a mentor figure that helps them through their struggles and hard decisions. She does this not through telling the teenagers what to do, but rather getting them to talk through their problems and figure out their own values and beliefs. Reception Kirkus Reviews reviewed the book, stating that \\"Ann Head deals all this out with a determinedly light hand, but her teenagers for all their troubles are all-American, and appealing--and some young marrieds may empathize, some older ones (women) sympathize.\\" Movie adaptation The novel was adapted for a made-for-TV movie of the same name in 1971.(14 November 1971). Bo Jo Jones' bumpy past, Independent Press-Telegram 20th Century Fox and Lester Linsk produced the movie.

He is Australia's only recorded male pirate.Georgatas, G., \\"An 18,000-year old history uncovered on WA island\\", National Indigenous Times, 20 June 2012, p. 14. Arrival in Australia Anderson arrived in the fledgling King George Sound colony (modern day Albany) aboard the American whaling vessel Vigilant in 1826. While the crew were drinking ashore, a fight broke out and a man was killed. Accused of murder, Anderson and several crewmates fled in a small vessel and hid out in the Recherche Archipelago, approximately 400 kilometres to the east. Piracy Anderson and his fellows established an encampment on Middle Island in Western Australia, as it was one of the few islands with a source of fresh water. The archipelago was heavily populated by Australian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals, and Anderson's band soon enriched themselves by trading furs to settlements along the coast; they are noted as visiting Kangaroo Island and the Althorpe Islands in South Australia. They supplemented their sealing income by robbing vessels travelling between Western Australia and the east coast colonies. They are also said to have murdered Indigenous Kaurna men and abducted women to take as sex slaves. The Recherche Archipelago was treacherous and uncharted, making it an ideal hideout for the pirates. In September 1834 Anderson and another black man, John Bathurst, arrived at Kangaroo Island from Long Island and clashed with whalers and Aboriginals. According to an 1842 report complaining about the lawlessness of sealers: > One of the most daring of these people was a man of color of the name of > Anderson, and lawless as these men were, they looked up to him with a sort > of dread. Anderson usually carried a brace of pistols about him, knowing > that he held his life by a very precarious tenure. By persevering exertions > he had amassed a considerable sum of money, and usually kept one or two > black women to attend on him and minister to his wants, when not engaged in > sealing. =Death= Anderson was eventually murdered by his fellow pirates, and is thought to be buried somewhere on Middle Island. According to a contemporary report: > They got quite disgusted with Anderson's harshness, and determined to remove > him, but were puzzled how to accomplish it, as he was a stout, powerful man, > and being armed was always on his guard. At last, one day when he was asleep > in the tent, one of them entered and, taking deliberate aim, blew his brains > out. The corpse was thrown into a hole, and covered over with earth, they > then shared the booty, and killed the native wowan [he was with] in case she > should afterwards tell the tale.

These data sets are often used by hedge fund managers and other institutional investment professionals within an investment company. Alternative data sets are information about a particular company that is published by sources outside of the company, which can provide unique and timely insights into investment opportunities. Alternative data sets are often categorized as big data, which means that they may be very large and complex and often cannot be handled by software traditionally used for storing or handling data, such as Microsoft Excel. An alternative data set can be compiled from various sources such as financial transactions, sensors, mobile devices, satellites, public records, and the internet. Alternative data can be compared with data that is traditionally used by investment companies such as investor presentations, SEC filings, and press releases. These examples of ‚Äútraditional data‚Äù are produced directly by the company itself. Since alternative data sets originate as a product of a company's operations, these data sets are often less readily accessible and less structured than traditional sources of data. Alternative data is also known as ‚Äúexhaust data.‚Äù The company that produces alternative data generally overlooks the value of the data to institutional investors. During the last decade, many data brokers, aggregators, and other intermediaries began specializing in providing alternative data to investors and analysts.  Types  Examples of alternative data include: * Geolocation (foot traffic) * Credit card transactions * Email receipts * Point-of-sale transactions * Web site usage * Mobile App or App Store analytics * Obscure city hall records * Satellite images * Social media posts * Online browsing activity * Shipping container receipts * Product reviews * Price trackers * Shipping trackers * Internet activity and quality data Example of sentiment analysis against stock price (S&P; 500)  Uses  Alternative data is being used by fundamental and quantitative institutional investors to create innovative sources of alpha. The field is still in the early phases of development, yet depending on the resources and risk tolerance of a fund, multiple approaches abound to participate in this new paradigm. The process to extract benefits from alternative data can be extremely challenging. The analytics, systems, and technologies for processing such data are relatively new and most institutional investors do not have capabilities to integrate alternative data into their investment decision process. However, with the right tools and strategy, a fund can mitigate costs while creating an enduring competitive advantage. Most alternative data research projects are lengthy and resource intensive; therefore, due-diligence is required before working with a data set. The due-diligence should include an approval from the compliance team, validation of processes that create and deliver this data set, and identification of investment insights that can be additive the investment process.  Methodology  Alternative data can be accessed via: * Web scraping (or web Harvesting, performed by computer programmers that design an algorithm that searches websites for specific data on a desired topic) * Acquisition of Raw data * Third-party Licensing  Analysis  In finance, Alternative data is often analysed in the following ways: * Scarcity: the data Information overload within financial markets * Granularity: the level of detail and aggregation of data (including time) * History: the trajectory of data * Structure: the form of the data (csv, json etc.) * Coverage: the stocks or geographical locations that data can be linked with  Best practices  While compliance and internal regulation are widely practiced in the alternative data field, there exists a need for an industry-wide best practices standard. Such a standard should address personally identifiable information (PII) obfuscation and access scheme requirements among other issues. Compliance professionals and decision makers can benefit from proactively creating internal guidelines for data operations. Publications such as NIST 800-122 provide guidelines for protecting PII and are useful when developing internal best practices. Investment Data Standards Organization (IDSO) was established to develop, maintain, and promote industry-wide standards and best practices for the Alternative Data industry.  Web Scraping  Legal aspects surrounding web scraping of alternative data have yet to be defined. Current best practices address the following issues when determining legal compliance of web crawling operations: * Review of the terms and conditions associated with the websites crawled * Control over the potential interference with crawled websites Web scraped data refers to data harvested from public websites. With 4 billion webpages and 1.2 million terabytes of data on the internet there is a mountain of information that can be valuable to investors when analyzing companies performance. The companies that specialize in this type of data collection write programs that access targeted websites and collect and store the scraped information on a periodic basis. In some cases web scraping requires use of public APIs as a way to access the data within those pages directly without visiting the actual website. Types of web scraped data include: * Job listings: A company that is increasing hiring and headcount is likely experiencing growth. * Company ratings: Sites like Glassdoor allows employees to rate their company; increasing ratings, especially (in conjunction with increasing job listings) can be another growth indicator. * Online retail data: High product rankings on online retailers suggest strong sales for those product manufacturers. On the flip side, heavy discounting of products suggest weak sales.Johnson, Richard.Data in Action: Web-Scraping.\\" 14 January 2019 Standards Board for Alternative Investment (SBAI) is the global standard-setting agency for the alternative investment industry and guardian of the Alternative Investment Standards.

At the time of passing the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 in March 2017, the terms of Britain's disengagement were unknown. The outlook was uncertain for the future funding of British scientific research and for the UK's future relationship, as a third country, with the EU for patent protection of innovation, trade in medium- and high-tech goods and industrial contracts issued by European scientific institutions. Opinions differed on whether scientific research and development would be affected by a loss of mobility and international collaboration, or whether Britain's withdrawal from the EU should be seen as an opportunity to expand scientific collaboration. The UK was initially due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 but the EU agreed to extend the departure date first to 31 October 2019 then to 31 January 2020, at the UK's request. Background =Negotiating policy= Following the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU), the British government notified the European Council on 29 March 2017 of its intention to withdraw from membership of the European Union 24 months later, by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This notification heralded the start of negotiations with the EU to determine the contours of their future relationship, including as concerned science and technology. The government's initial negotiating policy was outlined in a white paper published in February 2017, entitled The United Kingdom‚Äôs exit from and new partnership with the European Union.White Paper (February 2017) The United Kingdom‚Äôs exit from and new partnership with the European Union, Cm 9417 This document explicitly stated the UK's intention of remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners. The white paper mentioned in more general terms: controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK; securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other member states; protecting and enhancing existing workers‚Äô rights; forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU; and forging free trade relationships across the world. From the outset, policy requirements influencing or determining the withdrawal negotiation were expressed in the Preamble and Articles of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Article 3 mentions the promotion of \\"scientific and technological advance\\" in a context governed by the Union's aims for an internal market, and a highly competitive social market economy. A policy requirement mentioned in the Preamble is promoting economic and social progress for the peoples of the EU member states, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection. =Human resources in science and engineering = 330x330px In 2013, there were more than 259,000 researchers in the UK (in full-time equivalents). This corresponds to 4,108 researchers per million inhabitants, almost four times the global average of 1,083 per million. About 32,000 non-British EU academics occupy 17% of UK university teaching and research posts. There are over 42,000 international staff (non-UK EU and non- EU nationals) working at the Russell Group universities, a group of 24 research-intensive British universities that include Oxford and Cambridge Universities. International staff make up 25% of the overall workforce, 39% of academics and 48% of staff on research-only contracts at Russell Group universities. Over the period 2008‚Äì2014, the UK produced 15% of the world's most highly cited articles for a share of just 4% of the global research pool. Between 2008 and 2014, 56% of scientific articles published in the UK in internationally catalogued journals had at least one co-author who was based outside the country, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). The majority of these articles were co-authored by Americans (100,537), followed by German, French, Italian and Dutch scientists. These four European countries accounted for a total of 159,619 articles. =Funding of research in science and engineering= Britain's overall research intensity, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, is comparatively low: 1.63% of GDP in 2013, compared to the EU average of 2.02%. The UK's business enterprise sector performs two-thirds of the total. In 2015, Britain's scientific establishment expressed concern that 'UK investment in research was failing to keep pace with other leading nations and risks eroding the capacity to attract and retain the very best researchers from the UK and overseas'. Gross domestic expenditure on research and development performed by business enterprises in the UK as a share of GDP, 2005‚Äì2013. Other countries are given for comparison. Source of graphic: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 1.2, data from OECD As an EU member state, the UK participates in the European Research Area and it is considered likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.\\"It is likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.\\" All EU members contribute to the budget for each seven-year framework programme for research and innovation, the most recent of these being Horizon 2020, adopted in 2014. British researchers receive EU funding through programmes like Horizon 2020. Access to this money will now be renegotiated with the EU with the UK government committing to make up any shortfall to UK institutions. Once it is no longer a member state, the UK will not be entitled to EU structural funds, which are increasingly being used to finance research-related infrastructure. Over the period of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (2007‚Äì2013), the UK received ‚Ç¨8.8 billion from the EU, according to a report by the Royal Society citing European Commission data, and Britain contributed ‚Ç¨5.4 billion to this programme. In terms of funding awarded on a competitive basis, the UK was the second-largest recipient of the Seventh Framework Programme after Germany, securing ‚Ç¨6.9 billion out of a total of ‚Ç¨55.4 billion between 2007 and 2013. 330x330px British universities receive a disproportionate share of EU-awarded research grants. For instance, in 2013, the UK received more competitive research grants (close to 1000) from the European Research Council (ERC) than any other EU country; 44% of these grants went to non-nationals based in the UK, the largest number of any EU country. Germany obtained just over 600 ERC grants. This has raised questions about how such funding would be affected by a Brexit. On average, British universities relied on the EU for around 11% of their research income in 2014‚Äì2015. Two-thirds (66%) came from government sources, 4% from British businesses, 13% from British charities and 5% from sources beyond the EU. The EU share can be much higher for the top research universities. For instance, in 2013, the University of Manchester successfully applied for ¬£23 million from the European Regional Development Fund to create a National Graphene Institute. The UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Unit provided a further ¬£38 million. The University of Manchester is participating in the two flagship projects selected for ‚Ç¨1 billion in funding under Horizon 2020's Future and Emerging Technologies programme, namely the graphene project and the human brain project. The chancellor of the University of Oxford, Chris Patten, said in July 2016 that the university received about 40% of its research income from government and that its 'research income will of course fall significantly after we have left the EU unless a Brexit government guarantees to cover the shortfall'. On 13 August 2016, Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that British businesses and universities would have certainty over future funding and advised them to continue bidding for competitive EU funds while the UK remained a member of the EU. He said that all structural and investment fund projects, including agri-environment schemes, signed before the Autumn Statement would be fully funded and that the UK would underwrite the payments for research project funding awarded by the EU to universities participating in Horizon 2020, even when specific projects continued beyond the UK‚Äôs departure from the EU. On 21 November 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an increase in government investment in research and development worth ¬£2 billion a year by 2020 and a new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to back priority technologies. On 23 February 2017, the Business Secretary announced a ¬£229 million investment in research and development within the government's new industrial strategy, which is being developed in consultation with stakeholder groups. Of this investment, ¬£126 million is to go towards the creation of 'the world-class' National Graphene Institute at the University of Manchester, graphene having been first isolated at this university in 2004, and ¬£103 million to create a new centre of excellence for life and physical sciences at the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which will foster ties between academia and industry. On 20 November 2017, the Prime Minister‚Äôs office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued a statement announcing an extra ¬£2.3 billion of public money for research and development in 2021/2022, which would raise government expenditure that year to ¬£12.5 billion. The government is planning to work with industry to increase private investment, with the aim of seeing total research spending increase by as much as ¬£80 billion by 2027, to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP. By 2017, the UK had raised its research effort to 1.67% of GDP, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. =National Health Service= The Brexit Health Alliance was established in June 2017 with Sir Hugh Taylor as chair ‚Äòto safeguard‚Äô the interests of the health service. The 14 participating organisations cover the whole of the UK. The National Health Service is 'facing the worst nursing crisis for the last 20 years', with official figures published in June 2017 showing a 96% drop in less than in a year in the number of nurses from the European Union registering to practice in the UK: 46 European nurses arrived to work in Britain in April 2017, compared with 1,304 in the month after the Brexit referendum. As of February 2018, 62,000 National Health Service (NHS) staff in England were non- British EU nationals, equivalent to 5.6% of all NHS staff. This compares with 12.5% for non-British NHS staff overall, including staff from Asia and Africa. Non-British EU nationals made up almost 10% of doctors in England's hospital and community health services, just over 7% of all nurses and 5% of scientific, therapeutic and technical staff. More than one in three (36%) hospital doctors earned their main medical qualification beyond the UK: 20% in Asia and 9% in the EU. Some 4% of general practitioners qualified in the EU and 13% in Asia. Through the UK's status as an EU member state, British pensioners who have retired to the EU are entitled to have their medical treatment reimbursed in full or in part by the NHS under a reciprocal arrangement. In January 2019, Jeremy Morgan, health spokesman for British in Europe, said that 'if there is no deal, British in Europe calls upon Theresa May and [health secretary] Matt Hancock to guarantee to pay unilaterally for pensioners‚Äô medical treatment under the S1 scheme until it is replaced by bilateral agreements [with EU member states].' = Digital Single Market = In May 2015, the European Commission launched its Digital Single Market strategy. The EU is currently the UK's largest export market for digital services. Post-Brexit, there is a risk that UK service providers, such as broadcasters, platforms providing on-demand content, internet sales and online financial services may lose their passports to EU markets, as service providers need to be headquartered in an EU country to access these markets. =British participation in European institutions= According to a 2017 study by European law firm Fieldfisher, the UK contributes ¬£620 million annually to 67 European institutions. The study observed that 'following Brexit, it is likely that much of the budget will need to be redirected to support functions inside the UK.' The biggest savings will come from the UK no longer having to contribute ¬£470 million towards the running costs of 21 bodies that include the European Parliament, the EU's diplomatic service (the European External Action Service), the European Council, the European Court of Justice and the European Anti-fraud Office. Fieldfisher's Regulatory Group estimates that the British government 'will need to contribute around ¬£35 million annually to part-fund several EU agencies with which the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership' post-Brexit, The remainder (¬£114 million annually) will need to be invested in the UK counterparts or in new purpose-built UK government agencies, to maintain essential functions formerly carried out on the UK's behalf by the EU agencies. Different EU countries host specialized European agencies. These agencies may be responsible for enforcing particular regulatory regimes, or for pooling knowledge and sharing information. Examples are the European Medicines Agency based in the UK, the European Chemicals Agency based in Finland, the European Aviation Safety Agency based in Germany, the European Space Agency based in France and the European Food Safety Authority based in Italy. There are also three European Supervisory Authorities which are responsible for oversight in the field of financial services. One of the three is based in London, the European Banking Authority. In the white paper published by the Department for Exiting the EU in 2017, the British government stated that, 'as part of exit negotiations, the government will discuss with the EU and Member States our future status and arrangements with regard to these agencies'. According to this white paper, which is cited by the Fieldfisher study, the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership with some EU agencies. This includes those agencies 'which regulate aviation safety, maintain electricity transfer arrangements and deal with energy regulation, data protection, defence policy, policing and approaches to security and environmental policy'. A third country (that is, a non-EU member state) may participate in certain EU agencies by concluding an international agreement with the EU. These agreements cover issues such as the third country's budgetary contribution and staffing arrangements. In a blog post in July 2016, Merijn Chamon of the Ghent European Law Institute wrote that 'this option would allow the UK to pick and choose but the procedure is very cumbersome, which is also why today very few such agreements with third states have been concluded. For the UK, these agreements could, in theory, be incorporated in the Article 50 agreement, but it is doubtful whether that agreement is the appropriate instrument for such detailed arrangements'. In her Mansion House speech on 2 March 2018, the Prime Minister stated that we will also want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical for the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries: the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency'. She went on to say that 'we would, of course, accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those agencies and making an appropriate financial contribution. I want to explain what I believe the benefits of this approach could be, both for us and the EU. First, associate membership of these agencies is the only way to meet our objective of ensuring that these products only need to undergo one series of approvals, in one country. Second, these agencies have a critical role in setting and enforcing relevant rules. And if we were able to negotiate associate membership, we would be able to ensure that we could continue to provide our technical expertise. Third, associate membership could permit UK firms to resolve certain challenges related to the agencies through UK courts rather than the European Court of Justice'. If the UK leaves the EU Single Market and Customs Union, which was its stated intention as of December 2019, it may not be possible for the UK to obtain associate membership of the EU. In its draft negotiating guidelines published on 7 March 2018, the Council of the European Union stated that 'the Union will preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to (sic) EU Institutions, agencies or bodies'.  European Court of Justice  The government has said it plans to leave the European Court of Justice. Prime Minister Theresa May stated unequivocally at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016 that 'we are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That‚Äôs not going to happen'. The Prime Minister also pledged to curb free movement and indicated that she would seek Single Market access. These goals are, however, incompatible with EU statements that both free movement and ECJ adjudication are non-negotiable prerequisites for Single Market access. Unified Patent Court EU companies currently need to file for patent protection in all 28 member states. The unitary patent package adopted by 25 EU members in 2013 (by all but Croatia, Italy and Spain) is expected to slash procedural fees and translation costs by 85%. The unitary patent package will only apply, however, once the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court enters into force. For that to happen, 13 countries must ratify it, including France, Germany and the UK. By June 2018, 16 countries had ratified the agreement, including France on 14 March 2014 and the UK on 26 April 2018 - but not Germany, meaning that the court has not yet entered into force. In announcing ratification of the Unified Patent Court, the British Minister of Intellectual Property, Sam Gyimah, stated that 'the unique nature of the proposed court means that the UK‚Äôs future relationship with the Unified Patent Court will be subject to negotiation with European partners as we leave the EU'. Some British ministers have expressed concern at the potential loss of innovation and business interest in the UK, if Britain isn't part of the Unified Patent Court after it leaves the EU. Normally, members of the new patent court must be both EU members and members of the European Court of Justice. Even if the European Commission could be persuaded to ignore the requirement for EU membership, the UK would have to remain a member of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This is not because the patent court would be a conduit for EU law into Britain but because the patent court would occasionally have to refer to the ECJ on matters of European law when assessing patent cases, in order to know which definition to adopt. British judges were heavily involved in developing the procedures for the Unified Patent Court. When it was decided that the Unified Patent Court would be split into three locations, Prime Minister David Cameron 'succeeded in making sure that one of them ‚Äì which will rule on pharmaceuticals and life sciences ‚Äì was in London'. The UK has developed a reputation as a key hub in this area, an argument which helped it to win the bid to host the European Medicines Agency.  European Medicines Agency  The European Medicines Agency, which licenses new drugs, is based in London. The Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunt, has stated that the UK will leave this agency because it is subject to the European Court of Justice. Nineteen EU countries have offered to host the Agency. On 20 November 2017, the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands was chosen after several rounds of voting. The agency must move to Amsterdam and take up its operations there by 30 March 2019 at the latest. In September 2018, the European Medicines Agency decided to exclude the UK from all current and future contracts for the assessment of new drugs. This authorisation process is compulsory for all drugs sold in Europe. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency accounted for an estimated 20-30% of all drug assessments in the EU in 2018, earning the MHRA about ¬£14 million a year.  European Chemicals Agency  The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is based in Helsinki, Finland. It owns and maintains the world‚Äôs most comprehensive database on chemicals. The EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation requires industry to register information on the safety of substances they use in ECHA's central database. By 2018, 13 620 European companies had registered nearly 90 000 chemicals with ECHA that had been manufactured in, or imported into, the EU and European Economic Area. When several companies produce the same chemical, the registration with ECHA is shared between them Were the UK to leave the agency, it would be difficult to determine who owns the data that British companies have submitted to ECHA up to now. In her Mansion House speech in March 2018, the Prime Minister suggested that the UK could retain associate membership of ECHA once it becomes a third country but, as of mid-2018, it was not clear whether such a proposal would be acceptable to the EU. Even if the UK remains in the agency, British producers of chemicals will only be able to access the EU market post- Brexit if they comply with REACH. Since the EU is constantly updating its lists of banned and restricted chemicals, the British and EU regimes will diverge unless the UK regularly copies ECHA‚Äôs decisions on individual chemicals. Regulatory divergence would oblige UK producers wishing to export chemicals to the EU to comply with two sets of rules, adding red tape and pushing up costs.  European Aviation Safety Agency  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is based in Cologne, Germany. In 2017, the government was reportedly exploring the possibility of becoming an associate member of EASA to ensure that international flights out of the UK are not adversely affected by Brexit. Article 66 of EASA regulations establishes a legal route for a third country to participate in this agency. Were the UK to become an associate member of EASA, it would continue to make a financial contribution to the body but would lose its voting rights. In the case of a domestic dispute over the application of safety regulations, UK courts would have jurisdiction but, according to Article 50 of the same EASA rules, the European Court of Justice would be the ultimate arbitre of EASA rulings.  European Defence Agency  All EU members (except Denmark) are part of the European Defence Agency, which is based in Brussels. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted in November 2017 that 'the UK will no longer be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol. The UK will no longer be involved in decision-making, nor in planning our defence and security instruments'. In December 2017, the UK was one of 25 EU countries which signed up to the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the EU's new defence pact. In June 2018, the UK was one of nine EU countries which launched an autonomous European Intervention Initiative, along with Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The force will be able to deploy troops near Europe's borders in the event of a crisis. EU defence ministers also agreed in June 2018 to fix conditions for third country participation in PESCO projects that would also apply to the UK once it leaves the bloc. In June 2017, the European Commission announced that it was developing a collaborative research programme in innovative defence products and technologies at EU level that would become operational on 1 January 2021 when the EU's next seven-year framework programme for research gets under way. In June 2018, the European Commission proposed endowing the European Defence Fund with ‚Ç¨13 billion over the period 2021-2027 to enable cross-border investments in the latest interoperable technology and equipment in areas such as encrypted software and drone technology. Of this, ‚Ç¨4.1 billion will finance competitive and collaborative research projects, mainly through grants, involving at least three participants from three EU member states. Beyond the research component, ‚Ç¨8.9 billion will be available to co-finance with member states the cost of prototype development and the ensuing certification and testing requirements. In June 2018, the French press agency AFP cited an EU official as saying that 'currently, 80% of research and development in the European Union is done on a national basis. The result is 173 weapons systems that are not interoperable. We cannot let things go on like this.‚Äô Another EU official was cited as saying that 'countries that are not members of the EU and the European Economic Area will not be associated to the European Defence Fund unless a specific agreement is concluded to that aim. The programme is designed to apply as of 1 January 2021 and therefore for a Union of 27 Member States.'  Euratom  The government stated in its white paper of February 2017 that invoking Article 50 to leave the EU would involve leaving the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) as well. Although Euratom is an independent body, it is governed by EU bodies such as the European Commission, the European Council of Ministers and European Court of Justice. In the white paper, the government confirmed that ' the nuclear industry remains of key strategic importance to the UK and leaving Euratom does not affect our clear aim of seeking to maintain close and effective arrangements for civil nuclear cooperation, safeguards, safety and trade with Europe and our international partners. Furthermore, the UK is a world leader in nuclear research and development and there is no intention to reduce our ambition in this important area'. In the government's letter of 29 March 2017 notifying the European Council of the UK‚Äôs intention to withdraw from the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May announced ‚Äòthe UK‚Äôs intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community‚Äô. Euratom‚Äôs flagship project is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The ITER project involves a consortium made up of China, the EU, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States. The project is building an experimental reactor in France that will be powered by nuclear fusion, a technology which produces few pollutants. The EU is financing its 45% share of the ITER construction costs (‚Ç¨2.7 billion over the 2014‚Äì2020 period ) through the EU budget's Multiannual Financial Framework. 'During the forthcoming negotiations, the European Commission is expected to claim the UK‚Äôs share of this amount as a liability towards the EU'. Between 2014 and 2018, Euratom has a total research budget of ‚Ç¨1.6 billion under the Horizon 2020 budget, of which about ‚Ç¨728 million has been set aside for research on nuclear fusion. Of this, ‚Ç¨424 million has been earmarked for EUROfusion, a consortium of universities and national laboratories, primarily for ITER-related research. A further ‚Ç¨283 million will go to the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the UK's national laboratory for fusion research. The Culham Centre hosts the world's largest magnetic fusion experiment, Joint European Torus (JET), on behalf of its European partners. The JET facilities are used by about 350 European fusion scientists each year. JET has an annual budget of about ‚Ç¨69 million. Of this, 87.5% is provided by the European Commission and the remainder by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council within the Euratom Treaty. Research is not the only focus of Euratom. As stated in the government's Brexit white paper, 'the Euratom Treaty provides the legal framework for civil nuclear power generation and radioactive waste management for members of the Euratom Community, all of whom are EU Member States. This includes arrangements for nuclear safeguards, safety and the movement and trade of nuclear materials both between Euratom Members such as France and the UK, as well as between Euratom Members and third countries such as the USA'. In 2016, about 21% of the UK's electricity came from nuclear power. The UK ranks second in the EU after France for the number of operational nuclear reactors (15). In its Cooperation on Science and Innovation paper from 2017 on the UK's future partnership with the EU, the Department for Exiting the EU states that 'the UK hopes to find a way to continue working with the EU on nuclear R&D;, including the Joint European Torus (JET) and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (TER) programmes'.  European Space Agency  The European Space Agency (ESA) has 22 member states and is independent of the EU, even if programmes tend to benefit from EU funding. The Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, for instance, is 70% EU funded. This has raised concerns in the UK space sector as to whether British companies will be entitled to submit tenders for lucrative ESA contracts post-Brexit. The UK is aiming for its space sector to raise its global market share from 6.6% to 10% by 2030. Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage built Sentinel 5P, an air pollution monitoring satellite that was launched in the UK in October 2017 as part of the Copernicus programme. Sentinel 5P is part of a 45.5 million euro contract signed with ESA in 2011. The UK government stated in its future partnership paper on Collaboration on Science and Innovation that it wishes to remain fully involved in Copernicus, Galileo and the Space Surveillance and Tracking programme post-Brexit. Third countries may participate in ESA programmes but current arrangements tend to cover data access and usage, rather than eligibility to apply for large industrial contracts. In June 2018, a majority of EU member states sided with the European Commission in rejecting British demands to remain a full partner in the development of the Galileo satellite once the UK becomes a third country. This means that British companies will be unable to bid for the new round of contracts being issued by the EU. The British Minister of Universities and Science, Sam Gyimah, reacted to the decision by saying that Britain was willing to 'walk away' from the project and develop a rival satellite. The UK is demanding that the EU return the ¬£1 billion invested thus far by the UK in Galileo.  Galileo Security Monitoring Centre  In January 2018, the European Commission announced that the back-up security monitoring centre for Galileo, Europe's version of the Global Positioning System, would be relocated from Britain to Spain as part of the Brexit process. The centre was originally awarded to London in 2010 following a competitive bidding process.  CERN  The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is an independent intergovernmental organisation, subject to its own treaty. The UK‚Äôs membership of CERN is therefore unaffected by Brexit. Several of CERN‚Äôs member and associate member states are not EU members, and the organisation is headquartered outside the EU, in Switzerland. British citizens will retain the right to be employed by CERN, and British businesses will remain eligible to bid for CERN contracts. CERN‚Äôs core research programme is funded by its member states, but CERN also receives EU grants through the bloc's multi-year framework programmes, including Horizon 2020. CERN member states that neither belong to the EU, nor have special arrangements with the bloc, can participate in CERN-EU research projects but are not entitled to EU funding. British nationals will be entitled to apply for the EU‚Äôs Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowships as long as CERN receives funding from this scheme. Public comment up to March 2019 =Concerns over future mobility and international scientific collaboration= Scientists in favour of staying in the EU have noted that membership allows researchers to move freely between member states and to work with no restrictions. Immediately after the UK general election 2015, pro-remain scientists founded the grassroots campaign Scientists for EU. A group of leading British scientists wrote a letter to the Times on 22 May 2015 stating that ‚Äòit is not sufficiently known to the public that the EU is a boon to UK science and innovation. Freedom of movement for talent and ambitious EU science funding programmes, which support vital, complex international collaborations, put the UK in a world-leading position'. A Nature poll in March 2016 found that 83% of UK scientists were in favour of remaining in the EU. After the 2016 referendum, hundreds of scientists contacted Scientists for EU voicing concerns about the future of scientific research in the UK after Brexit, many saying they planned to leave the UK. Commenting in 2016, Kurt Deketelaere, secretary-general of the League of European Research Universities in Leuven, Belgium, whose purpose is to influence policy in Europe and to develop best practice through mutual exchange of experience, said that the potential loss of mobility and collaboration was worrying for scientists across Europe, as scientists wished 'to work with the best in their field'. However, for Angus Dalgleish, a cancer and HIV researcher at St George‚Äôs, University of London, who once stood for election as a member of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, universities already maintained successful collaborations with non-EU members, so opting out would have 'no negative impact on scientific collaboration whatsoever'. On 18 November 2016, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee published a report in which it recommended that the Department for Exiting the European Union appoint a departmental Chief Scientific Adviser to 'help ensure that the impact on science and research of various models for Brexit, and the opportunities these provide, is understood and prioritised within the Department'. The Committee also recommended raising the UK's commitment to research to 3% of GDP, the target fixed by the European Union in the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 and reiterated in Europe 2020, 'to demonstrate a determination not only to negotiating [sic] a post-Brexit relationship with the EU that is good for science but also to secure opportunities for science collaboration with markets beyond Europe'. In a press release of 18 November 2016, Scientists for the EU welcomed the report's recommendations but regretted that it portrayed research collaborations beyond the EU as an opportunity of Brexit. 'EU membership has never restricted UK science collaborations outside the EU', the press release stated. 'Rather, EU membership has enhanced UK global outreach via its world-leading programme'. Commenting on the press release, Martin Yuille, Co-Director of the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in Manchester, said that 'Brexit will not enhance opportunities for collaboration beyond the EU because, as an EU Member State, we already benefit from the global collaboration framework developed over the decades by the EU. The EU has Science and Technology Agreements with 20 countries (including the major economies) and is preparing similar agreements with further countries and regional groupings (e.g. the whole of Africa and the Pacific Rim). The EU is developing a permanent structure of scientific and technological collaboration with 180 countries. All that will need to be replaced by a UK outside the EU'. In its March 2018 report on Brexit, Science and Innovation, the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recommended that the Government ask the Migration Advisory Committee to integrate its conclusions regarding the immigration arrangements needed to support science and innovation into a broader agreement with the EU on science and innovation 'by October 2018 ... if a pact is not agreed in late 2018, this will increase risks to retaining and attracting the essential talent that our science and innovation sectors need. =Concerns over future funding of research= A July 2016 investigation by The Guardian suggested that some UK researchers were being discriminated against in funding and research projects after the referendum result. The newspaper reported that European partners were reluctant to employ British researchers due to uncertainties over funding. It cited a confidential survey of the UK's Russell Group universities, a group of 24 institutions renowned for research and academic excellence; in one case, 'an EU project officer recommended that a lead investigator drop all UK partners from a consortium because Britain's share of funding could not be guaranteed'. The uncertainty over future funding for projects stands to harm research in other ways, the same survey suggests. A number of institutions that responded said some researchers were reluctant to carry on with bids for EU funds because of the financial unknowns, while others did not want to be the weak link in a consortium. One university said it had serious concerns about its ability to recruit research fellows for current projects. In February 2017, the ComUE (Consortium of universities and establishments) of the University of Paris Seine issued an invitation to British universities to apply for space on site post-Brexit. The idea for a Paris Seine International Campus on the outskirts of Paris dates back to 2013 but, in light of the UK's impending departure from the EU, ComUE decided to reserve facilities and services for British universities to enable them to develop high-level research and teaching activities on site. Jean-Michel Blanquer, dean and president of ESSEC Business School, a member of ComUE, told the Times Higher Education Supplement that 'it would be a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù situation for UK universities concerned about losing European funding opportunities and international students'. In a notice posted on the research section of the European Commission on 6 October 2017, UK researchers were informed that, in the event of no bilateral agreement being in place covering arrangements for scientific cooperation after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, UK researchers would no longer be entitled to receive EU funding and would have to leave existing projects. The statement regarding Horizon 2020 funding read as follows, \\"If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU during the grant period without concluding an agreement with the EU ensuring in particular that British applicants continue to be eligible, you will cease to be eligible to receive EU funding (while continuing, where possible, to participate) or be required to leave the project on the basis of Article 50 of the grant agreement.\\" In its March 2018 report on Brexit, Science and Innovation, the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recalled that the UK needed to commit by October 2018 to contributing to the EU's next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027), or risk compromising its role as a 'science superpower'. The report stated that 'we are concerned that the Government‚Äôs default position does not appear to be that the UK will participate in Framework Programme 9. While the details of the Programme have not yet been agreed, the Government should state clearly that it intends to participate ... Specifically, the Government should state clearly in its response to this report that it intends to secure Associated Country status for Framework Programme 9'. On 21 July 2018, the newly appointed Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested that the UK might not honour the withdrawal agreement that guarantees continued funding of EU programmes until the end of Horizon 2020 in December 2020 through a transitional arrangement. According to a technical note published by the government in August outlining the likely consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the UK's participation in Horizon 2020, UK institutions would no longer be eligible for three Horizon 2020 funding lines after 29 March 2019: European Research Council (ERC) grants, Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), and SME instrument (SMEi) grants for small innovative businesses under a no-deal Brexit scenario. Mike Galsworthy, co- founder and director of Scientists for EU, described this document as 'a huge blow'. He commented that 'these three lines represent 45% of the UK‚Äôs receipts to date from Horizon 2020. If the UK is currently winning ‚Ç¨1.283 billion each year from Horizon 2020, then a no-deal Brexit will cost UK research ‚Ç¨577.35 million (¬£520.7 million) a year in lost opportunity to access these high-value grants. By far the most critical of those funding lines is the ERC. The UK has won ‚Ç¨4.73 billon to date from Horizon 2020 overall, with ‚Ç¨1.29bn of that in the form of ERC grants, ‚Ç¨0.7 billion in the form of MSCA grants and ‚Ç¨0.14 billion in SME Instrument grants. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK Research and Innovation would take over the funding of projects that currently receive payments from the European Commission. However, Dr Galsworthy observes that this would not allow UK research project coordinators to pay their partners in EU countries, forcing the UK partner to step aside from any coordinating role. The UK has coordinated more Horizon 2020 research projects than any other EU country. Tim Hardman, managing director of Niche Science & Technology, said in January 2019 that his business was planning to set up an office inside the EU post-Brexit. His firm has 18 employees, many of whom are scientists with PhDs. The company runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its base in London. He said that the firm had grown over the last 20 years thanks to EU grant funding, 'which the firm is reconciled to losing'. =Concerns over future market access= After the British referendum in June 2016, Carlos Ghosn, Chief Executive Officer of Japanese vehicle manufacturer Nissan, expressed doubts about the company's future in the UK if the country left the Single Market. After receiving written assurances from the government, Ghosn confirmed in October 2016 that its Qashqai and X-Trail SUV ranges would be built at its Sunderland plant but added that the firm would want to 're-evaluate the situation' once the final Brexit deal was concluded. The Business Secretary told the House of Commons on 31 October 2016 that the government had assured Nissan that it would continue its longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, work with the automotive sector to ensure that more of the supply chain could locate to the UK and maintain a strong commitment to research and development into ultra-low emission vehicles. He also said that, in its negotiations to leave the EU, the government would ensure that trade between the UK and EU member states was 'free and unencumbered'. As a large net contributor to the EU budget, Britain hosts one of the Airbus plants in Broughton. There is concern that the UK may lose this leverage post-Brexit. Airbus pays UK suppliers about ¬£4 billion per year and employs 15,000 people directly in the UK. About 4,000 of these employees design the wings for Airbus planes at Filton in Bristol. Another 6,000 workers build more than 1,000 wings each year at Broughton in Flintshire for commercial Airbus aircraft. In September 2017, Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the trade organisation for companies in the UK aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, expressed concern that, post-Brexit, 'there could be a long-term erosion of Britain‚Äôs competitiveness and that big projects will not be allocated to the UK'. Unless the UK strikes bilateral agreements with third countries before leaving the EU to replace those agreements established by the EU with these countries, or this area is covered by the Brexit agreement, British airline carriers will not be entitled to fly to third countries after 29 March 2019. AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest pharmaceutical companies, has decided to prioritise new batch release site in Europe, and consequently puts a hold on further investments at its UK‚Äôs Macclesfield site. GlaxoSmithKline, another large medical market player, has made a similar public announcement, that they will construct batch release sites in Europe, due to it being a requirement under EU law. The implementation of GSK's European laboratories will take at least 18 months,Polymermedics - Plastic Injection Moulder - How Brexit Will Affect the Medical Industry https://polymermedics.com/blog/guide/how-brexit-will-affect- the-medical-industry/ says Phil Thomson, GSK‚Äôs senior vice president of global communications, and adds that the latest estimates for GSK‚Äôs additional costs, in case of hard-Brexit, lie between ¬£60- and ¬£70 million. Senior executive at the EU arm of Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, David Jefferys, states that they are ‚Äúnot making any new investments in the UK until there is clarity‚Äù. Quote reported by the Guardian. In January 2019, Dyson, the British designer and manufacturer of hair dryers and vacuum cleaners, announced it was moving the company headquarters to Singapore, months after Singapore concluded a free trade agreement with the EU. Dyson has 12,000 employees worldwide, including 4,500 in the UK where the company has a research and development unit. The company denied it was moving its headquarters to Singapore for tax reasons or in relation to Brexit. The founder and CEO, Sir James Dyson, has been a vocal advocate of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. By the end of 2018, a number of large tech firms had relocated their headquarters from the UK to the continent, including Sony and Panasonic. A January 2019 survey of 1,200 British firms by the Institute of Directors found that 16% of firms had either activated relocation plans or were planning to do so and that a further 13% of firms were considering the move, in order to guarantee continued access to EU markets post-Brexit. Among exporting firms, the proportion rose to two- thirds.  Potential effect of tariff barriers on high-tech trade  In order to ensure continued unfettered access to the EU's internal market, the UK could choose to remain in the European Economic Area (like Iceland and Norway) or to conclude a number of bilateral treaties with the EU covering the provisions of the Single Market (Swiss model) but this would oblige the UK to adhere to the European Union's four fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of movement within the EU. If the UK leaves the current Customs Union when it exits the bloc, it will no longer benefit from the EU‚Äôs preferential trade agreements with more than 60 third countries, including Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico (agreement revised in 2018), the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey. Under this scenario, the UK would need to negotiate its own free trade deals with all of these countries over a number of years. On 22 May 2018, the European Commission opened negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand. The EU trades with an additional 24 countries on the basis of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, including the United States of America, Brazil and China. If no deal is concluded with the EU, the UK will have to fall back on WTO rules on tariffs post-Brexit for its trade with the EU and with countries benefiting from free trade deals with the EU. However, there are no default terms that would permit the UK to trade on WTO rules immediately after leaving the EU, according to Anneli Howard, a specialist in EU and competition law at Monckton Chambers in the UK. Other WTO members have blocked the UK from falling back on existing tariffs and tariff-free quotas under the EU's schedule, so that is not an option. Under a no-deal scenario, the UK would, thus, need to produce its own schedule for both services and each of the more than 5,000 product lines covered in the WTO agreement before getting all163 WTO member states to agree to it; as of 27 January 2019, 23 WTO states had raised objections to the UK‚Äôs draft schedule.  Potential effect of non-tariff barriers on high-tech trade  A March 2017 report by the House of Lords' European Union Committee concluded that non-tariff barriers post-Brexit could pose as much of a barrier to trade in goods as tariffs. It stated that both applying rules of origin and operating to two separate regulatory standards‚Äîfor the domestic and EU markets‚Äîwould be costly for UK businesses. The report analysed several high- tech sectors. 30x30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus‚Äôs commercial planes unit, cautioned in 2016 against erecting barriers to the free movement of people and parts across its European sites (in Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg), as the British plant is part of an EU value chain. 'We need a situation that is no less favourable than now', he said. 'When I build a set of wings in Broughton and send them to (the Airbus plant in) Toulouse , I don‚Äôt need a thousand pages of documents and tariffs'. = Rules of origin = Goods imported into a territory that is not part of a customs union must follow ‚Äòrules of origin‚Äô, a procedure which determines where a product and its components were made, in order to levy the correct customs duty. The House of Lords' European Union Committee observed in March 2017 that rules of origin would apply to trade post-Brexit, whether the UK concluded a free trade agreement with the EU or traded with the EU under the rules of the World Trade Organization. ‚ÄòApplying rules of origin will generate significant additional administration, and therefore costs and delays, to UK businesses‚Äô, the committee's report stated. = Standards and regulations = In his submission to the House of Lords' European Union Committee, Steve Elliott, Chief Executive Officer of the Chemical Industries Association, highlighted the importance of the EU‚Äôs Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations for the chemicals industry and expressed the view that the level of UK-EU trade was such that ‚Äòwe would need to continue‚Äô to comply with the EU‚Äôs Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. Chris Hunt, Director General and Company Secretary of the UK Petroleum Industry Association said that, as the European Committee for Standardisation was open to non-EU members, Brexit ‚Äòshould make no difference‚Äô to the UK‚Äôs membership and influence. Concerning the downstream petroleum sector, Mr Hunt stated that he would be ‚Äòvery keen to ensure that we stick with the COMAH Regulations‚Äô. Michael Tholen, Director of Upstream Policy, Oil and Gas UK, stated that the EU had ‚Äòno direct remit over the precise activities of oil and gas extraction offshore‚Äô but that the EU did influence the upstream industry through environmental standards and energy market standards. Through the Whole Vehicle Type Approval system, the EU sets standards for road vehicles which permit cars to travel or be sold across the EU without further inspections. The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told the House of Lords' Committee that ‚Äòthe validity of existing type approvals issued by the Vehicle Certification Agency once the UK has left the EU‚Äô required ‚Äòurgent legal clarification‚Äô. Mr Paul Everitt, Chief Executive Officer of the Aerospace and Defence Sector Group, told the committee that it is through the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ‚Äòthat we gain access to all of our major markets, whether it is the US, China, Japan or elsewhere‚Äô. For this reason, continued membership of EASA was ‚Äòour number one ask of the UK Government‚Äô. In the food and beverages sector, Agra Europe observed that, in areas such as food labelling and pesticide residues, ‚Äòany significant divergence from EU standards in these areas could make UK goods illegal on the EU market‚Äô. The House of Lords' European Union Committee heard in March 2017 that, in the pharmaceutical industry, UK standards would need to be recognised as equivalent by the EU as a pre-requisite for ongoing EU trade. Moreover, regulatory harmonisation and conformity to common labelling requirements would increase the production costs for British pharmaceuticals. Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK body that would take over from the European Medicines Agency, told the House of Lords in January 2017 that 'one of the biggest worries' he had about setting up a stand-alone regulator in post-Brexit Britain was that the UK would be 'at the back of the queue' for new drugs. Professor Paul Workman, president of the UK Institute of Cancer Research, expressed similar concerns. Since pharmaceutical companies sought regulatory approval for new drugs in the biggest markets first, he said, these companies would only approach the UK after the European Union, United States of America and Japan. He estimated that this could mean a delay of two years in new drug breakthroughs becoming available to British patients. Tim Hardman, managing director of Niche Science & Technology, which runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its base in London, commented in January 2019 that 'Britain has been at the forefront of developing the EU‚Äôs regulations. Now we are going to be a backwater with no influence at all'.

Life Born in London, he was the eldest child of Joseph Kirkup, a jeweller and diamond merchant there. He was admitted a student of the Royal Academy in 1809, and obtained a medal in 1811 for a drawing in its antique school. He became at this period acquainted with William Blake and Benjamin Haydon. Grave of Seymour Stocker in Livorno About 1816 Kirkup began to suffer from pulmonary weakness, and; after his father's death, visited Italy. He eventually settled there, living some time at Rome, where his friend Charles Eastlake was studying. There he knew John Keats (but missed his funeral on 26 February 1821, ill in bed) and in 1822 attended the funeral of Percy Bysshe Shelley. At Florence he lived for many years in a house on the River Arno, adjoining the Ponte Vecchio. Kirkup became a leader of a literary circle in Florence. He collected a library, of which a catalogue was printed in 1871, and maintained a copious correspondence. Walter Savage Landor, Robert and Elizabeth Browning, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, Edward John Trelawny, Joseph Severn were his friends. As a keen student of Dante, he was a disciple of Gabriele Rossetti. On Italian unification, Kirkup was created cavaliere of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus; he subsequently affected the title \\"barone\\". He was short, and good-looking as a young man; in later life, eccentric in his dress and habits, and deaf. He was a believer in spiritualism, and a follower of the medium Daniel Dunglas Home. Kirkup died at 4 Via Scali del Ponte Nuovo, Livorno, where he had lived since 1872, on 3 January 1880, and was buried on 5 January in the British cemetery there. Works Dante Alighieri, 1859 lithograph, after Seymour Kirkup, after a fresco attributed to Giotto Kirkup was a capable artist, but practised painting as a dilettante, He sent to the Royal Academy in 1833 a picture \\"Cassio\\", and in 1836 a lady's portrait. He also published etchings. He drew many portraits of his friends, including Trelawny and the journalist John Scott, and in 1844 made a self-portrait. In 1840 Kirkup, Bezzi, and the American Henry Wilde, had permission to search for the portrait of Dante, painted according to tradition by Giotto, in the chapel of the Palazzo del Podest√† in Florence. On 21 July 1840 they found it, and Kirkup made a drawing and tracing, before restoration work in 1841. The Arundel Society issued a reproduction from Kirkup's sketch, which was also engraved by P. Lasinio. Kirkup gave the tracing to Rossetti, who handed it on to his son Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and it was sold after the latter's death. Kirkup made some of the designs for Lord Vernon's edition of Dante's works. Family Kirkup had a daughter, Imogene, by Regina Ronti of Florence, who died 30 October 1856, aged 19; she married Teodoro Cioni of Livorno and died in 1878, leaving two children. On 16 February 1875, at age 87, Kirkup married Paolina Carboni, aged 22, daughter of Pasquale Carboni, English vice-consul at Rome. After he died she married Signor Morandi of Bologna.

Biography Cook was the son of Alfred Bramwell Cook and Dorothy Frances Cook (n√©e Money). He was born in Gujarat, India, where his father was a Salvation Army missionary and doctor, and spent most of his first 16 years there. He was educated at Breeks Memorial School in Tamil Nadu from 1942 to 1951, apart from a year at St Andrew's College in Christchurch in 1947‚Äì48, before completing his secondary education at Christchurch Boys' High School in 1952 and 1953. After a year at Canterbury University College, he went on to the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1959. Cook married Shirley Ann Hay in 1958, and the couple went on to have three children. Cook spent his working life from 1960 to 2002 at hospitals in Christchurch, apart from five years in London, England, and Michigan, USA, between 1964 and 1969. He was a clinical lecturer at the Christchurch School of Medicine from 1973 to 2003. Specialising in gastroenterology, Cook's main area of expertise was in the diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease, and in a study between 1970 and 1999 he and his co-workers showed that the prevalence of the disease in New Zealand was up to seven times greater than had previously been diagnosed. Cook served on the executive of the New Zealand Society of Gastroenterology between 1970 and 1978, and was its president from 1974 to 1976. He was patron of the Coeliac Society of New Zealand, and held advisory roles with various bodies including the Department of Health, the New Zealand Medical Association, and the Nutrition Society of New Zealand. Active in the Salvation Army, Cook did voluntary work for that organisation from 1974. In later years he served as archivist for the New Zealand Society of Gastroenterology, and wrote a number of books and papers on New Zealand medical history and the history of the Salvation Army in New Zealand. Cook died in Christchurch on 3 March 2017. Honours and awards Cook became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1973. He was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to medicine and the community.  Selected works * Cook, H. Bramwell, Michael J.

Sanchez was born in Spain and immigrated to Cuba at a young age. There, he worked as a dishwasher and laborer before moving to the United States. He was employed by Richard Nixon from 1962 to about 1980. The famously reserved Nixon developed a close relationship with Sanchez and once described him as a member of his family. Early life Sanchez was born in A Coru√±a, Spain. In 1946 he immigrated to Cuba where he worked as a dishwasher and laborer. In 1950 he emigrated, again, to Florida in the United States. Career =Early years with the Nixons= Sanchez began working for Richard and Pat Nixon in 1962 after being referred to the couple by Nixon family friend Bebe Rebozo. Sanchez and his wife Fina moved into the Nixons' 12-room apartment at 810 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Nixon would later describe the Sanchezes as \\"members of our family in a very special way\\". Twelve years later, when asked by a reporter if he would continue working for Nixon after he left office, Sanchez responded \\"the boss will not need to ask me. Wherever he goes in three years from now, he knows I will go with him\\". Manolo Sanchez, third from left, presents Richard Nixon with a cake at his 61st birthday party in 1974 at the San Diego home of Walter Annenberg. On January 15, 1967, Nixon held a dinner at his home during which he decided to run for president of the United States in 1968. In attendance were Pat Nixon, the Nixon's children, Nixon's longtime secretary Rose Mary Woods, and Manolo and Fina Sanchez. All attendees, except Pat Nixon, encouraged him to seek the Republican nomination. =White House years= Sanchez moved to Washington with the Nixons during the presidency of Richard Nixon, and lived with Fina in a suite on the third floor of the Executive Residence of the White House. Sanchez, along with the president's physician Major-General Walter Tkach and four United States Secret Service agents, accompanied Nixon during his unannounced 4:40 a.m. visit to the Lincoln Memorial on May 8, 1970, during which he met students protesting the Vietnam War. Nixon reportedly woke Sanchez at 4:22 in the morning and inquired if he'd \\"ever seen the Lincoln Memorial at night? Get your clothes on, we'll go!\\" At the memorial, Nixon toured Sanchez inside the sanctum and described the inscriptions; the pair were eventually approached by a group of about 30 protesters and spent the next two hours speaking with them. After White House personnel became aware Nixon had left the building unannounced, Ron Ziegler mounted a mission to retrieve him. After recovering the president, and during the return trip to the White House, Nixon insisted on stopping at the United States Capitol, where he took his former seat in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives and instructed Sanchez to make a speech. Sanchez spoke of his pride in being a citizen of the United States and Nixon and some female cleaners who were present applauded. One of the women present, Carrie Moore, asked Nixon to sign her bible, which he did, and holding her hand told her that his mother \\"was a saint\\" and \\"you be a saint too\\". White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman would later describe the incident in his diary as \\"the weirdest day yet\\". During his last years in the White House, Nixon became increasingly dependent on Sanchez, and the two developed a constructed language \\"sometimes using words that only the two of them understood\\". A jury summons Sanchez received in 1972 prompted a personal letter to the jury commissioner from John Ehrlichman for Sanchez to be excused from service \\"in order that he can be available to the president\\". Despite his loyalty to Nixon, Sanchez was known to have disagreed with the president on several occasions. During one incident, in 1973, Nixon expressed frustration to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Russell E. Train about overly cumbersome environmental regulations, citing the instance of mangrove trees at his property in Key Biscayne, Florida, which he couldn't cut down, before turning to Sanchez and asking \\"isn't that right\\"? Sanchez reportedly replied: =Post-presidency= He continued working for Richard and Pat Nixon at their post-presidency home in San Clemente, California. Sanchez was alone with Nixon when the latter suffered a near-fatal relapse after emerging from surgery for phlebitis in 1974. Before slipping into unconsciousness, Nixon told Sanchez \\"Manolo, I don't think I'm going to get out of here alive\\". After Nixon received a pardon from Gerald Ford, the Associated Press intercepted Sanchez while he was grocery shopping for Nixon in Palm Springs to get Nixon's reaction. Sanchez replied that, By 1980, after nearly two decades serving the Nixons, Manolo Sanchez retired with his wife, Fina, and returned to Spain. Personal life Sanchez was naturalized a U.S. citizen in 1968; Nixon sponsored his application, attended the ceremony, and took the oath of allegiance with him. Sanchez married his wife, Fina, in Spain. In popular culture In the 1995 film Nixon, Sanchez is portrayed by Tony Plana. During one scene in the film, Nixon asks Sanchez what he thinks of John F. Kennedy, to which Sanchez replies \\"he made me see the stars\\". In a subsequent interview, Oliver Stone explained that the quote was actually attributed to Robert McNamara and that he assigned it to Sanchez in the film as a joke; Sanchez was known to have intensely disliked Kennedy. In the 2008 film Frost/Nixon, Sanchez was portrayed by Eloy Casados.

In 2016, CfS agreed to a joint membership scheme with Momentum, a UK-wide grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership of the Labour Party.  History  CfS was originally established in 1994 to campaign against the removal of Clause IV from the Labour Party's constitution. By 2012, it was one of the only remaining ideological-based groupings in the party but Gerry Hassan and Eric Shaw, writing that year, claimed that CfS \\"has few members, little organisational presence and has had a negligible influence on the direction of the party\\". CfS played a key role in organising Neil Findlay and Katy Clark's leadership bid in the 2014 Scottish Labour Party leadership election. Though unsuccessful, CfS claims the campaign \\"built the foundations for Jeremy [Corbyn]'s campaign just a few months later\\" by \\"giving many new, young volunteers experience and a network of contacts across the country that would help quickly mobilise an effective campaign\\". In 2016, Scottish Labour Young Socialists founded in 2015 became CfS's official youth wing. In 2017, five CfS members won seats on the Scottish Labour Party's national executive. They called for the then Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, to pursue a socialist agenda and work more closely with Jeremy Corbyn's team.

He entered politics in later life, elected to the senate where between 1901 and 1912 he represented Finist√®re.  Life  Jules Marie Armand de Cuverville was born at Allineuc, a small village a short distance inland from Saint-Brieuc in Brittany. His father was Louis-Paul de Cuverville who represented the locality on the monarchist benches in the National Assembly between 1849 and 1853. Louis- Paul's family was descended from the lords of the manor at Maucomble in Normandy, some of whom had been Squires to French kings. Other kinsmen included sailors and naval officers, such as his grandfather, the Rear Admiral Louis-Hyacinthe Cavelier de Cuverville. Jules Marie attended school at Saint Sauveur de Redon and the lyc√©e in Rennes before entering naval college in 1850. He emerged in 1852 and participated at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854‚Äì55), where he was badly wounded. There were further missions in Africa and in the Crimea. He served in Algeria as deputy to Vice-admiral de Gueydon between 1871 and 1873. He was briefly given command of the avisos \\"Kleber\\" and \\"Cuvier\\" before being seconded to the diplomatic service, serving as naval attache at the French embassy in London during the middle 1870s. He then returned to France, serving aboard the Infernet as a commander with the South Atlantic Naval Division between 1875 and 1879, and promoted to the rank of ship's captain in 1878, taking command of a succession of training ships. He was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1888 and appointed a member of the Admiralty Council. Between 1890 and 1892 he served as head of the North Atlantic Naval division and was involved in the Pacification of Dahomey. He became a vice-admiral in 1893, and then Maritime Prefect for Cherbourg, a member of the Upper Admiralty Council, commender of the Reserve Mediterranean Squadron in 1897 and inspector-general of the marine in 1898. He was Chief of Staff of the French Navy between 1898 and 1899. Jules de Cuverville was elected to the senate on 31 March 1901 in a bye-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent, General Ars√®ne Lambert, who had died. He was re- elected in the general election of 4 January 1903. He lost his seat to Maurice Fenoux by a narrow margin on 7 January 1912, however. Brittany, then as subsequently, was relatively conservative in religious terms, and during the summer of 1902 Jules de Cuverville was among those at Le Folgo√´t, vigorously opposing the closure of the school of the Daughters of the Holy Spirit, and the concomitant expulsion of the nuns there. The sisters had fallen foul of the anti-congragationist legislation which was part of the Paris-based government's determined pursuit of La√Øcit√© (separation of secular and religious institutions). A friend and political ally of Jacques Piou, he joined the Popular Liberal Action (political party), becoming one of its most passionate supporters. He was appointed a party vice-president in 1907. Deeply Catholic and steadfast in his commitment to the Third Republic, Admiral Count de Cuverville had two principal political priorities: defence of the church and support for the navy. Several months after losing his seat in the senate, Jules de Cuverville was crushed by a truck while crossing the street in Paris. He survived long enough to be taken to his home at 15, rue Dugay-Trouin, but died a few hours later.

On December 20, 2013, two UNMISS helicopters were fired on by anti-government forces when evacuating military personnel and internally displaced persons in Yuai. One of the helicopters was damaged. The deteriorating security caused the United Nations to relocate its personnel from Yuai. By August 2014, there were 14,000 internally displaced persons in the Yuai area.

Plot 1991, Saint Petersburg, last days of the USSR. Director of a greengrocery Sergei Nenashev earns money not only with trade, but also with fraud. However, he acts as a kind of Robin Hood: the victims of his scams are government officials, and other, often much more dangerous crooks. Some time ago, Nenashev worked at a secret research institution where he authored a number of technical innovations to which application was not found in the conditions of the Soviet economy. However now Nenashev with his associates expertly use these \\"gadgets\\" in fraud. As a result of a \\"transaction\\", a batch of \\"Parabolic antenna's\\", fake, of course, were sold to Azerbaijanis who trade flowers on the market. A little later, having received incriminating videos of the intimate kind featuring businessman Baev (orgy with prostitutes) and theater director Arkhipov (homosexual act with a young waiter), Nenashev starts to blackmail both of them. Attempts by the police to arrest Nenashev while he is getting the money are thwarted: each time Sergei finds an ingenious way to outwit the police. Nenashev has a teenage daughter from his first marriage, but after the divorce, he is alone. Suddenly, at the hairdresser Sergei meets Nastya, a very beautiful girl from a simple working family. Parents of Nastya perceive \\"speculator\\" Nenashev's flirting in a very negative way, Nastya herself also believes that she is just another \\"plaything\\" for the cynical rich man. However, a longer acquaintance with Nenashev assures Nastya that Sergei sincerely loves her, and then reciprocal feelings awaken in the girl. Trouble comes from an unexpected side. Exiled for petty theft Kostya, Nenashev's assistant, finds the Azerbaijanis with fake antennas and their benefactor - powerful mafioso \\"Prince\\" Gilya. \\"Prince\\", wanting to punish Nenashev who deceived him, orders him to pay a huge sum of money, taking as hostage Sergei's daughter. Having sold all the property and taking money in debt, Nenashev collects the necessary amount, but \\"Prince\\" requires a new redemption, this time in a foreign currency. So without letting go of Nenashev's daughter, mafia takes Nastya as hostage too. Realizing that he alone can not do anything, Nenashev refers to the police, which has been on the hunt of the \\"Prince\\" for a long time. Employees of the department for combating organized crime agree to help Nenashev, but in return he must write a written statement describing all the occurrences of his fraud. Sergei personally writes it, receives the dollars from the police and goes to meet the \\"Prince\\". During the transfer of money a special police unit storms the suburban cottage of the mafioso. The \\"Prince\\" is arrested, and his chief henchman \\"Mormon\\" dies in the crossfire and Kostya who betrayed Nenashev. Nastya and Nenashev's daughter are released, and Sergei wants to take them home. However, Major Kuzmin has Nenashev's confession and is ready to arrest him but... in response he receives the latest \\"trick\\" of the genius swindler. Sergei wrote the text with invisible ink, the evidence has disappeared, and now the stunned Major only possesses an empty sheet of paper.

From modest origins, in 1878 he was recruited into the Johor Civil Service.Abdul Rahman Andak on the Brookwood Cemetery website He was appointed State Secretary of Johor in 1894 and for twenty years he was advisor to Sultan Abu Bakar and Sultan Ibrahim. History =Early life= Abdul Rahman was the son of Andak bin Meng, a minor government official, with his first wife Hawa Binti Abdullah. When in 1871 the childless Maharaja Abu Bakar sent a nephew, Ungku Othman, to be educated in England Andak was sent too in recognition of his potential. Following his graduation Andak was recruited into the Johor Civil Service in 1878.Biography of Abdul Rahman Andak =As Sultan's adviser= He became the Private Secretary to Maharajah Abu Bakar in 1884 and in 1885 he was selected by the Maharajah as one of his senior advisers to negotiate the Anglo-Johor Treaty with the British Governor Sir Frederick Weld. Under this treaty the British recognized Abu Bakar as Sultan of Johor and the Treaty became a buffer for Johor against further British colonial designs in the region. In 1886 Andak received the Order of the Crown of Johor (DPMJ) (Second Class) and the honorific title of Dato‚Äô Sri Amar DiRaja. Andak received the Order of the Crown of Johor (SPMJ) (First Class) in 1892 and was appointed State Secretary of Johor in 1893 with a seat on the State Council. For twenty years he was advisor to Sultan Abu Bakar (Sultan of Johor 1862-1895) and Sultan Ibrahim (Sultan of Johor 1895-1959). Andak's influence over Sultan Abu Bakar lead to the Sultan becoming increasingly reluctant to accept British advice. Andak drafted the Johor Constitution, the first to be written by any of the Malay States, and which became law in 1894. Andak was the founder of the Pakatan Belajar Mengajar Pengetahuan Bahasa (\\"Language Knowledge Teaching Pact), a literary society which increased the usage of the Malay language and made it the official language of the government; the body was also responsible for introducing neologisms expressing new ideas of governance brought with British influence. It later became the Royal Society of Malay Literature of Johor. A Freemason, he was initiated into the Lodge of St George No 1152 in Singapore in 1889. Abdul Rahman Bin Andak in the England, United Grand Lodge of England Freemason Membership Registers, 1751-1921 - Ancestry.com Andak's grave in Brookwood Cemetery =Retirement= The British Government attempted to stop the government of Johor from receiving advice from its own Johor Advisory Board in London and also attempted to build a railway line across Johor. Seeing Andak as a threat to their plans, they also attempted to force his resignation. Cecil Clementi Smith wrote of him \\"as a clever little fellow but an absolute nobody among the Malay aristocrats\\". Other descriptions include \\"corrupt\\" and \\"a mischievous little dog\\". Frank Swettenham denigrated him as ‚Äúa bad adviser for anyone, quite unscrupulous... and dangerous because he speaks English and has to do with Europeans all his life.\\" Eventually he was dismissed by Sultan Ibrahim and sent into forced exile in London in April 1909 with an annual pension of ¬£1,000. In England Andak oversaw the education of Sultan Ibrahim's sons Ismail (who succeeded his father as Sultan), Abu Bakar and Ahmad while they were attending schools in London. =Personal life= Andak married twice, firstly to Che' Lembek, who died in 1885 and with whom he had a daughter, Rahmah. He later married Auguste \\"Gustel\\" Reis (died 1933), who after the marriage took the name of Auguste Abdul Rahman and lived with her in London where they had three sons, Henry, Mansor and Walter.

In May, Chou and Hsu Jung-shu were invited to the United States and addressed the US Congressional Committee for Democracy on Taiwan. Chou served as magistrate of Changhua County from 1989 to 1993 and was a member of the Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council between 1994 and 1998. She was elected to the Legislative Yuan via party list proportional representation later that year, but won reelection by running for a district seat in 2001. As a lawmaker, she supported environmentalism and women's rights. In 2004, Chou proposed a bill to offer a more stringent legal definition of unwelcome sexual contact. The next year, she backed a bill that mandated the use of tracking technology on paroled sex offenders. Chou also proposed initiatives to lessen employment discrimination against people with mental health problems. Shortly before stepping down from the Legislative Yuan at the end of her term in 2005, Chou announced that she was running for the party leadership, a position that eventually went to Su Tseng-chang. Subsequently, Chou was named to the Presidium of the fourth National Assembly, representing the Democratic Progressive Party. She also served on the DPP's Central Standing Committee.

The first rector of the college was the Polish Jesuit priest Jakub Wujek.

The institution experienced a special momentum in the 18th century, when a large boarding school, called Convictus Nobilium, was built next to the church and university, where students were received regardless of their ethnic origin. Since 1698 until 1786 the Academy evolved into Universitas Claudiopolitana (see the see the cover of the book from 1742 by Andreas Matis entitled Peregrinus Catholicus de peregrina unitaria religione), and later even having the four classical faculties: Philosophy (since 1581), as a prerequisite for Theology (since 1581, re-organized in 1712/1767), Law (1774), and Medicine (since 1775/1776)\\"History of UBB\\" .

The institution had the rights to confer the university/academic titles of baccalaureus, magister, and doctor. The University operated during this first period near the Church on Faekas street (today str. Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu nr. 21, today in Cluj-Napoca, Romania). For funding the University of Cluj was granted the income of the Monastery of Kolozsmonostor (Cluj-MƒÉnƒÉ≈ütur), with six villages.

F√∂gymnasium t√∂rt√©nete (1579-1898), Kolozsv√°r, 1898, p. 62. In 1753 Universitas Claudiopolitana was re-organized as an imperial university, more and more under the influence of the state, rather than the Jesuits. Following 1773, after the suppression of the Society of Jesus, Empress Maria-Theresa further developed Universitas Claudiopolitana (with teaching both in Latin and German). Indeed, during its maximum development, Universitas Claudiopolitana had the four classical faculties: Philosophy (since 1581), as a prerequisities for Theology (since 1581, re-organized in 1712/1767), Law (1774), and Medicine (since 1775/1776). Due to the reforms in the empire, the Universitas Claudiopolitana was transformed in 1786 into a semiuniversity institution (e.g., institution, which made the connection between secondary studies and university studies, for example, having the right to confer superior titles of baccalaureus, even magister, but not doctor). Thus, the Universitas Claudiopolitana was followed after 1786 by two institutions with a semiuniversity statute: (a) the Surgical-Medical Institute and (b) the Academy of Law (1786-1850 and re-founded in 1863). Then, starting with 1872, the Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsv√°r was founded, with teaching in Hungarian, which included the two semiuniversity institutions already existing in the city. In 1919, the Hungarian university was taken over by the Romanian authorities and the Romanian University of Cluj has been established. The Romanian and the Hungarian universities ‚Äì derived from Franz Joseph University and King Ferdinand University - were united in 1959 under the name of Babe»ô- Bolyai University. Victor Babe»ô was a famous Romanian physician/biologist, one of the founders of microbiology and a professor at the King Ferdinand University of Cluj. The name Bolyai is related to the famous Hungarian family of mathematicians from Transylvania (J√°nos and Farkas Bolyai).

It was a collegiate church from the 12th century until 1840. The present building is largely 13th-century and is designated as Grade I listed.  History  A church was mentioned at Hestrebe in the Domesday Book of 1086. The church was given to Salisbury Cathedral by Henry I in about 1115, together with the church of Godalming, Surrey, and lands lying beside the two churches, to form a prebend. Shortly after this the church became collegiate, with the head of the college the canon who held the prebend at the Cathedral. A charter granted by bishop Josceline (or Jocelin) between 1150 and 1160 established four canons at Heytesbury. Their income included tithes from Tytherington, where there was a chapel, and from Horningsham; the churches of Hill Deverill and Swallowcliffe; and land at Wilton. From about 1220 the prebend of Heytesbury was annexed to the deanery of Salisbury, thus the Dean of Salisbury was also Dean of Heytesbury. Most collegiate churches were abolished in 1547 as part of the Reformation but Heytesbury continued until it was suppressed, along with the other remaining non-residential deaneries, by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840.  Architecture and interior  The large cruciform church dates from the 13th century, although a fragment of earlier work survives: one pier of the north aisle, with a scalloped capital, is partly from the late 12th century. The low tower over the crossing was completed in the 14th century and the clerestory was added in the mid-15th. The south chapel, founded c. 1316, is dedicated to St Catherine. In the north transept, Walter Hungerford founded a chapel in 1421; the 16th-century stone screen survives. The tower has six bells: the tenor is from c. 1460, alongside two from the 17th century and two from the 18th. The vestry and the gabled south porch are from the 19th century. Restoration in 1864-7 was by William Butterfield and included rebuilding of the north and south aisles; interior work included the addition of a coloured marble font in the south aisle, new pews, a polychrome tiled floor, and stained glass by Alexander Gibbs. Pevsner criticised the restoration, describing the buildings as \\"A large and impressive church, but an over-restored one [...] which makes it externally more rewarding from a distance than from near by and internally disappointing in spite of its undeniable grandeur\\". However, he added that \\"Most of the glass of Butterfield's restoration is good and characteristic. Pale colours, good leading.\\" The organ was installed in 1854 by J.W. Walker, having been moved from St Mary's, Bermondsey, London. It was taken down during Butterfield's restoration and reconstructed in 1867 in a new position, with new casefronts in deal. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1968.  Parish  Dependant churches and chapels of Heytesbury were those nearby at Tytherington, Knook, Hill Deverill, Horningsham, and the more distant church at Swallowcliffe, some to the south. In 1885 the benefice of Heytesbury-with- Tytherington was united with Knook, and this union was reaffirmed in 1970. In 1976 the parishes of Sutton Veny and Norton Bavant were added. Since 2000 the church has been served by the Upper Wylye Valley team. Parish registers survive from 1653 and are held by the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre at Chippenham.

Edible mushrooms have variety of benefits when consumed. Some healthy factors that edible mushrooms can be related to humans are that they have essential nutrients we need for a healthy life, including protein, vitamins B, C and D, and selenium (which helps prevent cancer). They are a good source of iron, copper, riboflavin, niacin and contain dietary fiber. One portobello mushroom can contain more potassium than a banana. In many cultures, mushroom picking is an important tradition and can be a substantial source of income. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it is estimated that the value of the yearly mushroom harvest in a forest can equal the value of lumber produced from that same forest in some situations. According to the ‚ÄúMenus of Change‚Äù initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition, pairing the evidence for health- and sustainability-linked food choices with flavor, other culinary, and demographic trends and plausible business scenarios allows flavor-rich, largely plant-based food and menu choices to emerge (presented by G. Drescher, The Culinary Institute of America, at the Mushrooms and Health Summit on 9 September 2013). Mushrooms, with their unique sensory and culinary functional properties, may help Americans move toward healthier, plant-based choices. Of particular interest are the high amounts of both glutamates (not as monosodium glutamate) and ribonucleotides in A. bisporus. Glutamate and certain 5‚Ä≤-ribonucleotides are taste-active chemicals responsible for umami, considered by some to be the fifth flavor of food.

Life Born at the farm of Cwrt, Llanfwrog, Denbighshire, he was the son of Peter Foulkes and his wife Frances. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to Isaac Clarke, a printer in Ruthin. In 1854 he went to Liverpool, before completing his apprenticeship. He spent some years as a compositor in the Liverpool printing office of the Welsh language newspaper Yr Amserau, and later worked in the printing works of David Marples. In 1862 he set up his own printing business in Liverpool, which he ran for the rest of his life. In May 1890 Foulkes began to issue Y Cymro (The Welshman), a weekly newspaper in Welsh intended primarily for Liverpool Welsh readers, but soon read widely in Wales as well; he was both editor and publisher, and made the journal a literary forum. Foulkes died at Rhewl, near Ruthin, on 2 November 1904, and was buried in Llanbedr churchyard.

A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The disclosure of media ownership can be prescribed by generic regulation (commercial law) or by media-specific provision. Such measures may mandate the disclosure of information on media ownership structures to specific authorities or to the general public. Turkey has both generic company laws and media-specific regulations on transparency of the print, broadcasting and online media outlets. Despite the existence of such laws, according to some experts the existing regulatory framework does not guarantee the disclosure of crucial information and to know who actually owns and influences the media in Turkey.  Overview  With regard to the disclosure of media ownership information, Turkey has both generic company laws and specific regulations concerning the printed, broadcast and online sectors. These regulations provide both for the disclosure to public bodies such as the Chief Prosecutor's Office and the ‚ÄúRadio and Television Supreme Council‚Äù (RTUK), and for the disclosure to citizens through the publication of ownership information on the media companies‚Äô websites. However, a research by Access Info Europe shows that the existing laws misses to prescribe the disclosure of crucial information therefore failing to actually disclose who owns and influences the media in Turkey. In fact, neither print media (under the Press Law) nor broadcast (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts) or online media (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts and the Law on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online) are required to report the essential information needed to identify ownership. Also, as Access Info notes, the law applying to broadcasting and on demand services does not require to disclose if shares are held on behalf of another nor the existence of beneficial owners. Uncertainty in the realm of transparency of media ownership in Turkey increased after 2001, when the ban on media conglomerates' bidding in public tenders was removed. In the last 15 years, the biggest Turkish media owners are corporations also operating in sectors such as construction, energy, mining and tourism. In this regard, strong ties with the government are lamented by Turkish civil society and the international community. The situation of uncertain transparency of media ownership increased throughout 2015 and 2016, when government's trustees were appointed to allegedly Gulenist-affiliated media outlets and companies. A takeover took place in October 26, 2016 for the Koza-Ipek Media Group, which owned, among others, Bugun and Millet dailies and Cihan News Agency. Similarly, trustees were appointed on March 5, 2016, for Feza Holding, the media holding publishing, among others, the most read newspaper in Turkey, Zaman, and the English-language daily Today's Zaman. The assets of these companies are currently under the jurisdiction of the government's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF), and it is not clear if the companies will be either dissolved or sold off. Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey's Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the appointment of trustees.  Legal framework  Disclosure of ownership information of broadcast media (radio and television) is required by Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts (2011) and by the Regulation on the Administrative and Financial Terms to Be Obeyed By Media Service Provider Institutions and the Platform and Infrastructure Service Operators (2011). With regard to print media, disclosure is required by the Press Law No. 5187 (2004). Finally, with regard to online media, disclosure is required by Law No. 5651 on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online and the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles of Internet Broadcasts (2007). Law No. 6112 on broadcasters requires ‚Äúmedia service providers‚Äù to report ownership information. They are defined as legal entities which choose the content of the radio, television and on-demand broadcasting services. Instead, according to the Press Law, ownership information have to be disclosed for media organizations publishing ‚Äúprinted materials‚Äù. Finally, the legislation on online media includes within its scope content providers, hosting service providers and access providers (under Article No. 3 of Law No. 5651). They should publish their up to date information in the homepage of their website. According to the relevant regulations for radios and televisions, ownership information have to be notified when a licence application is made, in cases of transfer of shares, acquisition and merger, changes to the disclosed information and annually, following the annual general meeting of shareholders. Instead, under the Press Law, information have to be disclosed before publishing a newspaper or other periodicals. Except for online media, if the information has the nature of commercial secret, it can be withheld. For instance, this was the case when the Media Ownership Monitor ‚Äì a project conducted by a team of members of Bianet, an independent Turkish press agency, and Reporters Without Borders ‚Äì requested information regarding the Turkish public broadcaster's (TRT) finances. Sanctions for non-disclosure are foreseen in the Press Law and in the Internet Law, covering only printed and online publications. Also foreign media organizations are covered by the above listed requirements. = Information to be disclosed = According to the laws, the information that have to be disclosed by the information providers are: * Name and contact details of media organisation; * Name and contact details of owner; * Country of domicile of company with an interest; * Citizenship/residence status of individual with an interest; * Except for the online media, the size of shareholding, namely the current shareholding structure, the voting shares, the capital-shares, the managers * Management details: names of the members of board of directors, names and citizenship details of general managers and managers in charge and the duties of managers); * Only for broadcasting media, if spouses, blood relatives and relatives in law up to the third degree are shareholders in the company, it will be indicated within the shareholdership structure considering these shares as owned by the same person; * Only for print media, disclosure is required also for political, religious or other affiliations of shareholder, interests by owners in other media organisations and in non-media businesses. Experts consider that existing obligations are not sufficient to establish who the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media organisations are. = Disclosure to public authorities = According to the Press Law, disclosure of ownership information has to be made to the Office of the local Chief Prosecutor. According to Law No. 6112 on media service providers (broadcaster), their ownership information have to be reported to the ‚ÄúRadio and Television Supreme Council‚Äù (RT√úK) . However, experts consider that regulators have no transparent, credible, and accessible annual records on media ownership. = Disclosure to the citizens = The information notified to the RT√úK have also to be published by the media organizations concerned on their websites. Under the Press Law, the records of the Public Prosecutor's office shall be public and anyone can see the relevant files containing published information and documents by making an application. Information on media ownership can be obtained by the public by making a Freedom of Information request, under Law No. 4982, on the Right to Obtain Information which entitles individuals to request information and documents from public and publicly owned bodies. Usually, requests for information related to media ownership are raised by professionals and media institutions, while it is not common among ordinary citizens. Media service providers (radio and TV broadcasters) can only be set up as joint stock companies. Only joint- stock companies have to disclose information to the trade registry, under the Turkish Commercial Code No. 6102. Media companies entering in the category of public joint-stock companies also have to respect the Capital Market Law No. 2499 (1981) and the Communiqu√© on Financial Reporting of the Capital Markets Board. These public enterprises should regularly draw financial statements to the Capital Markets Board, and annual reports should be disclosed to the public. An example of public joint-stock company in the field of media is the state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT- T√ºrkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu). The results of a survey clearly showed that the sole enforcement of commercial law provides insufficient information regarding who effectively owns and ultimately controls media organizations.  Beneficial ownership  None of the laws regulating print, broadcast and online media requires disclosure of beneficial owners, i.e. holders owning shares on behalf of another person, or those with indirect control or a significant interest to a media authority or to the public. If the media company is established as a joint stock company, shareholding information can easily be accessed through the company's website and through the database of the trade registry. However, if shares are owned by one and actually used by another one as per an internal agreement, this information is not required to be disclosed by private or publicly-listed companies meaning ultimate ownership cannot therefore be identified. For this reason, experts consider that a reasonable, non-technical individual would not be able to ascertain who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media organisation, from the information available.  Influence of advertising financing  As advertising is an important income for media providers and the allocation of advertisements may influence editorial policies or weaken certain media rather than others, media service providers (broadcasters) shall report their monthly commercial advertisement income to the RT√úK, by the 20th day of the following month. The distribution of public funds on advertising is existentially an important source of income for smaller papers but the relative data remain hidden. For instance, the request of information on this topic by the Media Ownership Monitor was refused by the Turkish Right to Information Assessment Council, citing ‚Äútrade secrets‚Äù as a reason. Following the coup attempt, on October 5, 2016, regulations regarding the Press Advertising Institution (Basƒ±n ƒ∞lan Kurumu- Bƒ∞K)- the authority managing public announcements and advertising- were changed. According to this contested regulation,Regulation No. 29848, October 5, 2010, Art. No. 110. any news outlet that employs a journalist who is being tried on terrorism related charges will not be given state advertising, unless the employee is fired from the media organization in five days.  Civil society initiatives  Referring to the actions to be taken at a domestic level, some experts underlined the importance of encouraging public debate on media ownership, and to enhance media literacy on this topic. In 2016, Reporters Without Borders, together with the Turkish independent press agency Bianet, launched the project Media Ownership Monitor Turkey to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Turkey, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets (both individual owners and media companies) and detailing also the interests and the affiliations of owners into companies or political parties. Another civil society initiative is the Network Data Compiling, a collective data compiling and mapping project dedicated to pursue the relations between capital and power in Turkey, released on July 14, 2014.

Jahrhundert. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 1993, p. 476.  Life  Gertrud Leutenegger was born and grew up in Schwyz, Switzerland, where her father was a book editor. She later lived in both the Italian-speaking and French-speaking parts of Switzerland. After completing her secondary education she initially undertook teacher training and became a Kindergarten teacher. She also worked in a psychiatric clinic for a time and was as a custodian at the Nietzsche House in Sils Maria. Leutenegger's interest in theatre led to drama studies at the Z√ºrich University of the Arts from 1976 to 1979 where she studied director's theatre (Regietheater). She worked as assistant producer to J√ºrgen Flimm, a noted exponent of Regietheater, at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, Hamburg, in 1978. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Jury Prize of the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize for her early literary work. Many other prizes and distinctions followed. After short spells in Florence and Berlin, Leutenegger lived for a long time in Japan. She now lives in Z√ºrich. In 2010 she was elected to the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt.  Work  Leutenegger first came to prominence as a poet, later bringing her poetic vision to her novels, the first of which, Vorabend, was published in 1975. Her work is noted for its subjective vision, use of myth and fairy tale, dreams and poetry. There is also a strong element of political engagement, for example in the 1985 novel Kontinent which deals with issues of environmental damage. Leutenegger's most recently published work was the novel Panischer Fr√ºhling. This tells the story of a woman stranded in London when the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj√∂kull in 2010 brought all air-traffic to a sudden halt. This was shortlisted for both the Swiss Book Prize and the German Book Prize in 2014 and was awarded the Roswitha Prize in the same year.
