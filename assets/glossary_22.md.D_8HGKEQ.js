WNIO also carries Ohio State University football and basketball, Pittsburgh Pirates baseball, Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and the Indianapolis 500 from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. History The station was founded in 1939 as WFMJ by William F. Maag, Jr. from whose initials the call letters were derived. Maag was also publisher of The Youngstown Vindicator. It was originally at 1420 kHz, and moved to 1450 kHz during the NARBA frequency shift on March 29, 1941. It moved to its present location 1390 kHz during the mid-1940s. During the 1940s and early 1950s WFMJ was an affiliate of the Blue Network and its successor ABC. In 1948, Maag launched WFMJ-FM at 105.1 MHz; the FM station is now WQXK. On March 8, 1953, Maag started Youngstown's second television station WFMJ-TV on channel 73. The television station moved to its present location, channel 21, on August 7, 1954. The AM station changed its callsign to WHOT on April 23, 1990, when it was sold by its original owners to the owner of WHOT-FM, and it used the historic call sign from the former Top 40 AM station that originally broadcast daytime only on 1570 kHz and later full-time on 1330 kHz. Four years later, it was sold to Connoisseur Communications, and it changed to WRTK on February 15, 1995, assuming a talk radio format as \\"Real Talk 1390.\\" In order to obtain Justice Department approval to purchase WQXK (FM) and WSOM (AM),#441: 10-23-97 - Connoisseur Communications Gets Justice Department Clearance to Acquire Two Youngstown, Ohio Radio Stations Connoisseur was forced to sell WRTK as well as WBBG (FM). The stations were sold on February 23, 1998 to a subsidiary of Bain Gocom, the Boston venture capital company that was a major investor in WKBN-TV's former parent company. In a few months, Jacor Communications entered into a LMA with Bain Gocom for all of their radio stations in Youngstown and New Castle, including WRTK and WBBG. Combined with Jacor's existing station holdings in the area - and a merger with Clear Channel months later - ten stations were under the same operational and management control in the New Castle/Youngstown region. The station became WNIO on November 1, 1999, after Clear Channel relocated WNIO's adult standards format and callsign from the daytime-only 1540 kHz facility in Niles, Ohio (that station would assume the WRTK calls and would be spun off to different owners in early 2001). Clear Channel Communications purchased WNIO along with WNCD (which switched dial positions with WBBG in late 2000) and WAKZ from Bain in 2005, after it had dropped its petition on January 14, 2004 to purchase those three stations along with WICT due to FCC objections,http://www.business-journal.com/archives/20040311andreawood.asp and also included Clear Channel selling off their station clusters in New Castle and Johnstown to Forever Broadcasting, LLC. From 2000 until 2010, WNIO also served as the flagship station for Mahoning Valley Scrappers minor league baseball. In November 2010, Clear Channel announced that WNIO would drop its standards format in favor of Fox Sports Radio on December 27. The move will coincide with the displacement of the network from crosstown WANR 1570 AM in Warren, which switched back to its former classic hits format under the moniker \\"The Blizzard.\\"http://www.vindy.com/news/2010/nov/02/gross-revenues- for-movies-for-the-weeken/ This is one of two Standards stations changing their format in the Youngstown region.

On September 7, 2020 WNIO rebranded as \\"1390 The Gambler\\", becoming the second iHeart sports station in Ohio to carry the \\"Gambler\\" name (after Cleveland market station WARF AM 1350). With the new branding, WNIO also added sports gambling oriented programming from the BetR Network, during the evenings.

It was discovered by Eleanor and Ron Helin on 5 January 1989 from images obtained on the 3rd and 4th of that month. It is a Jupiter family comet known for extremely close approaches to Jupiter being a Quasi-Hilda comet. During these approaches, it actually orbits Jupiter. The last such approach was in 1976, the next will be in 2071. The Jovian orbits are highly elliptical and subject to intense Solar perturbation at apojove which eventually pulls the comet out of Jovian orbit for the cycle to begin anew. Simulations predict such a cycle is unstable, the object will either be captured into an encounter orbit (e.g. Shoemaker-Levy 9) or expelled into a new orbit which does not have periodic approaches. This implies that 111P's orbit is recent within the past few thousand years. It fits the definition of an Encke-type comet with (TJupiter > 3; a < aJupiter).

It is situated on a hill west and north of the Glomma river, standing astride the ancient Vinger Royal Road, which connected Norway and Värmland, Sweden as well as on the north-south Norwegian route along the Glomma. As Kongsvinger formed a key junction point for these routes, fortifications were constructed there to protect against invasion from the east. Arsenal at Kongsvinger Fortress. Well and old barracks at Kongsvinger Fortress. History =Medieval period= During the early medieval period, pilgrims traveled to the shrine of St. Olaf at Trondheim; a favorite route for those from Sweden (the Vinger Royal Road) passed via Eidskog, Vinger (now Kongsvinger) and Elverum up the Glomma. This important pilgrimage & trade route is mentioned by Adam of Bremen in 1070. Its importance as an established road leading both north and south from the Swedish border was the basis for its later military significance. Between 1130 and 1217 Norway underwent a period of Civil Wars. The Bagler faction contested with the Birkebeiners, led by the pretender King Sverre, for control during the late 12th century. Many of the rebels found refuge in Värmland and the Vinger area was the site of numerous conflicts. Sigurd Ribbung harassed King Haakon IV of Norway’s lands across this border. In 1224 they fought a battle at Vinger. Ribbung’s troops were defeated and fled. =Early modern period= In the spring of 1643 the Swedish Privy Council determined that their military strength made territorial gains at the expense of Denmark/Norway likely. The Count drew up the plan for war and directed a surprise multiple-front attack on Denmark and Norway in May. Norway, which was then governed by Christian's son-in-law, Statholder (royal governor) Hannibal Sehested, was a reluctant participant. Some Finnish people in the Finnskogen, who had migrated from Sweden and whose loyalties were often with Sweden, were caught spying on Norwegian troops at Vinger. A rather desultory war between Sweden and Norway, often called the Hannibal War, resulted from 1643 to 1645. Vinger was the staging area for several minor Norwegian invasions into Sweden as this final episode of the Thirty Years' War was completed. The most important consequence of this war was that the royal governor identified the need for fortifications at Vinger and elsewhere along the border and initiated a tax for the purpose. Since there was great discontent, this tax burden was lifted in 1646 by Christian IV of Denmark and Norway; as a result no fortification construction was begun at that time. In 1673, Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve wrote that construction was underway on a defensive structure on top of a hill. Once completed, it would dominate the river and the existing sconce by the ferry crossing. This structure was called Vinger Sconce or Gyldenborg and was a precursor to Kongsvinger Fortress. It was never attacked during the Scanian War, which broke out in 1675, but it did fire its cannons against a Swedish reconnaissance unit. An attack was launched from Vinger in February 1679, but it was unable to penetrate deep into Sweden due to insufficient artillery. Following the war, fortifications were improved along the border toward Sweden. Plans were made for a star-shaped fortress and construction began in 1682 on the site of the old Vinger Sconce. The new fortress was named Königs Winger, which has since become Kongsvinger, both meaning King's Vinger. Today, Øvrebyen, the old Kongsvinger uptown area around the fortress is dominated by wooden buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries, laid out in the typical right angle square plan - by architect Major General Johan Caspar von Cicignon - popular in this period. In 1709, during the Great Northern War, Norway was mobilized and by the end of October 1709, 1,500 men were stationed at Kongsvinger. When in 1716 it became apparent that the Charles XII of Sweden intended to invade, three fortresses along the Swedish border were again extensively manned: Kongsvinger Fortress, Basmo Fortress and Fredriksten Fortress. The attack fell on Basmo and Kongsvinger was bypassed. =Industrial revolution period= Although a significant part of the Norwegian border fortification during several wars with Sweden, Kongsvinger never saw attack. The closest offensive occurred in 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, when a Swedish column advanced against the fortress of Kongsvinger. They reached the Glomma River after a victory at Lier on 18 April, but did not cross the river and invest the fortress. On 10 March 1809 an interim armistice was signed at Kongsvinger. Later, in 1814, the most bloody battle between Swedish invaders and defending Norwegian forces during the Napoleonic Wars took place at Matrand, a short distance from Kongsvinger on the Eidskog road. The Swedish lost 337 men, compared with 139 killed and wounded on the Norwegian side. Aasmund Olavsson Vinje (1818–1870) was a famous Norwegian poet and journalist who wrote in his Ferdaminni fraa Sumaren 1860, \\"One of the finest views in the country is to stand at Kongsvinger Fortress and gaze down the Glomma.\\" =Twentieth century= In 1905, when the union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved, a neutral zone was established in which all fortifications were to be demolished. Kongsvinger lay just outside this zone and the fortification survived. Nazi Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940. Although not invested, Norwegian fortresses fell under German control. In August 1942 a school providing four-week course in national socialist ideology opened for the Germanske SS Norge at Kongsvinger Fortress. Several classes graduated there.

Stilted arches of the gallery. The Court of the Lions (; ) is the main courtyard of the Nasrid dynasty Palace of the Lions, in the heart of the Alhambra, the Moorish citadel formed by a complex of palaces, gardens and forts in Granada, Spain. It was commissioned by the Nasrid sultan Muhammed V of the Emirate of Granada in Al- Andalus. Its construction started in the second period of his reign, between 1362 and 1391 AD. The site is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage List and minted in Spain's 2011 limited edition of 2 € Commemorative Coins. Background and architectural influences The Palace of the Lions, as well as the rest of the other new rooms built under Muhammad V,John Stothoff Badeau, John Richard Hayes, The Genius of Arab Civilization: Source of Renaissance, 1983, MIT Press, 260 pages like the Mexuar or Cuarto Dorado, represented the beginning of a new style, an exuberant mixture of Moorish and Christian influences that has been called Nasrid style. During the period that Muhammad V was ousted as sultan of Granada by his stepbrother, Abu-l Walid Ismail, he discovered in exile a host of new aesthetic influences that were not in the language of his predecessors, not even in his own first contributions to the enrichment of the Nasrid palaces of the Alhambra. In Fes he saw the Almoravid mosque of Qarawiyyin, built by Moroccan architects. The splendor of the decorations, specially the profuse use of the muqarnas that had once decorated the palaces and mosques of Al-Ándalus, stunned the ex- sultan, as did the ruins of the Roman city of Volubilis, where he could directly examine the classical orders, Roman ornamentation and, above all, the disposition of the Roman impluvium; the Roman ruins at Volubilis were particularly well preserved since they had been abandoned for a period of time in the Middle Ages and later re-used as a necropolis. Muhammad became an ally of his personal friend, the Christian king Pedro I of Castile, who helped him to regain the throne and defeat the usurpers. Meanwhile, he was also astonished with the construction of the palace of Pedro I, the Alcázar of Seville, built in Mudéjar style by architects from Toledo, Seville and Granada. The influence of this Mudéjar style of King Pedro in the future Palace of the Lions was going to be decisive, especially the structure and disposition of the Qubba rooms along two axis of the 'Patio de las Doncellas' (\\"Courtyard of the Maidens\\"). Description The Courtyard of the Lions is an oblong courtyard, 35 m in length and 20 m in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the courtyard at each extremity, with filigree walls and light domed roof, elaborately ornamented. The square is paved with coloured tiles, and the colonnade with white marble; while the walls are covered 1.5 m up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed, with a view to artistic effect; and the general form of the piers, arches and pillars is most graceful. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; above each arch there is a large square of arabesques; and over the pillars is another square of filigree work. In the center of the courtyard is the celebrated Fountain of Lions, a magnificent alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble. At present, the fountain is under restoration in an effort to preserve its integrity. It has been argued by Georges Marçais that the spacing of columns and arches was set to the golden ratio, but there is no strong evidence that Muslim architects ever used it. Instead, as Antonio Fernández-Puertas postulates, the rectangles used in the construction may have been based on square roots and surds. Meaning of the structure The structure of the courtyard, has, as it has been said, a direct influence of the Sevillian Patio de las Doncellas, but its meaning and origins trace their roots to early Islamic gardening, the courtyard divided in four parts, each one of them symbolizing one of the four parts of the world. Each part is irrigated by a water channel that symbolize the four rivers of Paradise. This courtyard is, therefore, an architectural materialization of Paradise, where the gardens, the water, and the columns form a conceptual and physical unity. The slender column forest have been said to represent the palm trees of an oasis in the desert, deeply related with Paradise in the Nasrid imagination. In the poem of Ibn Zamrak on the basin of the fountain, a further meaning is stated clearly: \\"The fountain is the Sultan, which smothers with his graces all his subjects and lands, as the water wets the gardens.\\" Nowadays the flower garden has been replaced by a dry garden of pebbles, in order not to affect the foundation of the palace with the watering. In Nasrid times, the floor of the quartered planting beds was slightly lower than the general level, and the visual effect was like a tapestry of flowers, as the top of the plants were cut to the same level of the courtyard, and these were carefully chosen to cover a host of color nuances. Lion Fountain The fountain Some research suggests that the 11th century lions of the Lion Fountain came from the house of the Jewish vizier Yusuf ibn Nagrela (d. 1066). It is not known if they were made before his death, and at the time, he was accused of wanting to build a bigger palace than the king's.official site They are large for sculptures of animals in Islamic art, but as in other sites of al-Andalus such as the earlier Medina Azahara near Cordoba, there are multiple animals. The Pisa Griffin is even larger. There is an almost exact description of the original fountain, written by the poet Ibn Gabirol in the 11th century. They represent the 12 tribes of Israel, two of them have a triangle on the forehead, indicating the two extant tribes Judá and Leví. The Lions were removed in 2007 for restoration on the premises while the fountain was restored in situ. The lions were put back in place in July 2012 after reconstruction of the traditional water flow system of the Court of the Lions. =Excerpt of Ibn Zamrak's poem on the basin= The poet and minister Ibn Zamrak wrote a poem to describe the beauty of the courtyard. It is carved around the rim of the basin:Ed. by José Miguel Puerta Vílchez, Reading the Alhambra: A Visual Guide to the Alhambra Through its Inscriptions, trans. by Jon Trout ([no place]: The Alhambra and Generalife Trust and EDILUX s.l., 2010), p. 169.

They take place all over Europe, in countries including Austria, England, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia and Scotland. ISBTs promote both the sport of badminton and the social aspect of the game. ISBTs are open to all standards of player. Many of the student tournaments allow recent graduates to enter under their former clubs or as graduate teams. The players are divided into 4 categories - A (national to top regional standard), B (regional to top club standard), C (club standard) and D (recreational standard). Each player competes in two out of the three disciplines: singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Each match consists of 2 games, so that the result is either a 2-0 win, 0-2 loss or 1-1 draw. The tournaments are usually 3 to 4 days long and consist of playing badminton during the day and partying at night. Competitors often sleep in the same sports hall where the matches are played and are typically woken up in the morning to the sound of themed music and announcements of the first match of the day. A good example of such a wake up song is \\"Guten Morgen Sonnenschein\\" by Nana Mouskouri, however, in the UK and Ireland, accommodation is arranged by the teams themselves. In the event that a player does not turn up for a match, their opponent will receive a walk-over and full points. ISBTs are almost always themed, with a fancy dress party on the last night. Past themes include * Wild West * 70's * Seven Deadly Sins & Seven Heavenly Virtues * 3 * Hollywood The 'Swiss ladder' system is used to rank the players. This means that players compete against others who have had similar results in previous games. A player does not normally play the same opposition twice. After the last round has been played either the player at the top of the table is the named the winner, or there is a play-off between the top two pairs of the division. Players do not enter with a set partner. Each player will be allocated a partner at random from the same section they have entered. This is to even out each section and also highlight the social aspects of these tournaments. ISBTs have grown rapidly in popularity over the last few years. One of the largest ISBTs on record was the 2008 Irish ISBT that took place in Limerick, Republic of Ireland, at which over 250 players from all over Europe participated. Team Newcastle (or otherwise known as Newcastle Old Boys) are the most successful franchise in the tournament history. They have won the team trophy, awarded for the best averaged individual player results, 5 times between 2002 and 2015. International Solibad Badminton Tournament In June 2013, London hosted the first annual International Solibad Badminton Tournament.

History The town is known from 861, the name deriving from the Latin amnis, then amnius, meaning \\"river\\". It is first mentioned in an 1184 document when it was a fief given by the Vicenza bishop to the Trissino family. Two castles were erected on two opposite hills, one being named the Valdagno castle and the other the Panisacco Castle. However the Vicenza comune started very soon to contend it to the Trissino family, who in turn joined forces with Scaligers to defend it. In 1291, in the course of the war with Verona, the Republic of Venice occupied Valdagno and kept it until 1340. In 1377 it was pillaged by Bernabò Visconti and in 1404 it went back to the Venetians. From 1434 to 1439 it was occupied by the Visconti family and then re-annexed to Venice by Gian Giorgio Trissino. Between 1510 and 1514 it suffered repeated destruction by the armies of Maximilian I, during the War of the League of Cambrai. Starting from 1797, with the fall of the Republic of Venice, Valdagno fell under French and Austrian rule. It was annexed to the newly created Kingdom of Italy in 1866. Valdagno is the birthplace of Gaetano Marzotto, a pioneer of the textile industry and founder of the Marzotto, which allowed Valdagno to become an industrial centre. Sport The town has a football team, A.C.D. Trissino-Valdagno and is home to the rink hockey team Isello Hockey Valdagno.

History According to legend, Trojans escaping from the fire and the destruction of their city, Troy, founded Siris. Some of the inhabitants of the city later advanced westwards, following the vast valley of the Sinni river, up to the lake and to the Sirino mountain (from which they took the name), near present-day Lagonegro, where they founded the city of Siruci (now called Seluce). From here, they went to the Tyrrhenian Sea, on the beach of the Gulf of Policastro. Here they founded the colony of Pixous. This event is shown in a rare series of ancient coins, in archaic characters, with the names of Sirinos and Pixoes inscribed, referring respectively, to the populations of the two cities of Siris and Pixous, respectively. The name \\"Pixous\\" comes from the root \\"PYX\\", which derives from the Greek word for boxwood (present in the coat of arms of Pisciotta town hall). In the year 194 BC, the Greek word pixous became corrupted to the Latin Buxentum. In AD 915, when the town was plundered and burnt by the Saracens of Agropoli, the town's name had already changed to Policastro. Many of the fleeing Bussetani went beyond the promontory of Palinuro, where they founded a small village that they called Pixoctum, in memory of their lost town. Over the years the name had changed many times - Pixocta, then Pissocta, then Pichotta and finally Pisciotta. The name of Pisciotta is found in the Catalogus Baronum (1144). The year 1464 marked for the country a very important development, when the survivors of Molpa, following the destruction of their village, were sheltered in Pisciotta. Until the abolition of feudality in 1806, Pisciotta was owned by the Caracciolos (1270), the Sanseverinos (15th century), the Pappacodas (from 1590). Beginning in 1996 (or so) Pisciotta became host for a summer study-abroad program conducted through SUNY Purchase College. Geography Located on a hill above the coastline of Cilento and its port and marina, Pisciotta lies on the national highway 447 between Ascea and Palinuro. The municipality borders with Ascea, Centola and San Mauro La Bruca; and counts the hamlets (frazioni) of Caprioli, Marina di Pisciotta and Rodio.

Biography She was born in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to Laura Davis Holmes (1839-1932) and Isaac Franklin Kingsbury (1841-1919). She graduated from Newton High School in 1886 and received her B.A. from Boston University, where she had been a member of Phi Beta Kappa, in 1890. During college she performed volunteer work in a teenage girls' club at Boston's St. Augustine's Episcopal Church, an African American congregation, and at \\"St. Monica's Home for old colored women.\\" After graduation she taught Latin in the Somerville, Massachusetts High School for two years. In 1894 she started a year of graduate school at Radcliffe College. Two Boston organizations, the Church of the Carpenter, a Christian Socialist church founded by W. D. P. Bliss, and Denison House, a settlement house run by Helena Dudley, had a lasting influence on Simkhovitch. She visited black and immigrant families in Boston’s tenement slums, observed and documented their poverty, and became aware of the power and wealth of the city’s slumlords. In 1895 she attended the University of Berlin on a scholarship from the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. Her mother accompanied her to Europe in the summer of 1895 and stayed in Berlin while school was in session. It was there that Mary met and became engaged to Vladimir Simkhovitch (1874-1959), a Russian student of economics. During the summer of 1896 she and her friend Emily Greene Balch, the future Nobel Peace Prize winner, attended the International Socialist Trade Union Congress in London. After London she attended Columbia University where she worked with Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and James Harvey Robinson and boarded with the writer Anne O'Hagan Shinn.

Introduced as a variant of the medium-duty C/K truck line, three generations were produced. Slotted between the C/K trucks and the GMC Brigadier Class 8 conventional, the Kodiak/TopKick were developed as a basis for vocationally-oriented trucks, including cargo haulers, dump trucks, and similar vehicles; on later generations, both cutaway and cowled-chassis variants were produced for bus use. Following years of declining market share, General Motors (in line with Ford Motor Company) sought to exit heavy-truck manufacturing. After struggling to enter joint ventures or sell the rights to its product line, the company ended production of the Kodiak and TopKick in 2009. The final medium-duty truck, a GMC TopKick 5500, rolled out of Flint Truck Assembly on July 31, 2009.

Sharing the cab of the medium-duty C/K trucks, the hood length was shortened nearly 5 inches (reducing the BBC length to 92 inches); the hood length was also shorter than the Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Brigadier Class 8 conventionals. Within the C/K series, the model line was designated as a Chevrolet C70/GMC C7000. The Kodiak followed the Chevrolet naming tradition of \\"frontier beast\\" names for heavy conventionals (Chevrolet Bison and the Chevrolet Bruin) while the TopKick was a military slang term (in line with the GMC Brigadier and GMC General). The model line was offered in single and tandem-axle configurations as both a straight truck and as a semitractor. Shared with the Bruin/Brigadier, the Kodiak and TopKick were powered exclusively by the Caterpillar 3208 10.4L diesel V8. To accommodate the larger engine, the C/K hood adopted the boxier shape of the 90-series Bruin/Brigadier; the change shifted the cab upward several inches. To optimize engine ventilation, the grille was enlarged (repositioning the headlights below the grille). Following the withdrawal of Chevrolet from the Class 8 truck segment after 1980, the Kodiak became the largest truck offered by the Chevrolet division. Second generation (1990–2002) 1997-2002 GMC TopKick in use as a crew transport truck The second generation of the Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick was introduced for 1990. Under the GMT530 architecture, all GM medium-duty trucks were consolidated under the Kodiak/TopKick nomenclature, with C/K shifting to consumer-derived vehicles (pickup trucks). Following the 1986 joint venture between GM and Volvo, GMC ended production of the General, Astro, and Brigadier, leaving the Class 6-7 Kodiak/TopKick as the largest vehicles produced by GM. In line with the previous generation, while designed with its own heavier-duty chassis, to lower the costs of tooling, the cab of GMT530 trucks was derived from the GMT400 C/K pickup (introduced in 1988). As before, two-door and four-door configurations were offered; a raised-roof cab became optional during the 1990s. Over its thirteen-year production run, the GMT530 platform underwent relatively few changes; as airbags were not required in medium-duty trucks, the 1988-design interior was retained through the entire production run. For 1995, GM replaced the Kodiak and TopKick badging with C4500-C8500 model names, bringing the medium-duty trucks in line with the rest of the C/K naming convention. As an option, a lower-profile \\"aerodynamic\\" hood became an option (not offered on severe-service or school bus applications). In a break from the single engine offering of the first generation Kodiak/TopKick, GMT530 adopted the powertrain line of the 1973-1989 medium-duty C/K trucks. Gasoline engines were offered as standard equipment, with diesel engines as an option. The standard gasoline engine was a 6.0L fuel-injected V8, with an optional carbureted 7.0L V8 (replaced by a 7.4L V8 in 1991); in the mid-1990s, the 7.4 L became the standard gasoline engine. In 2002, the 7.4-litre V8 was replaced by the 8.1-litre Vortec V8 (the highest- displacement V8 ever built by Chevrolet). In place of the Caterpillar 3208 V8 diesel used in the first generation Kodiak/TopKick, the GMT530 trucks offered the Caterpillar 3116 inline-six with . This was upgraded to produce beginning with the 1991 model year. The Caterpillar 3126 inline-six was introduced as an optional diesel engine in 1997. After GM ended production of the GMT530 for the US market after 2002, production for Mexico continued in Toluca, Mexico, through 2008. From 1995 to 2001, the GMT530 was assembled in Brazil using components imported from Mexico, built to Mexican specifications. All Brazil- market examples were produced with the Caterpillar 3116 diesel engine. In Brazil, the trucks were badged according to their GMVR (in metric tons) and rounded horsepower output (12-170 for 12 tons-170 hp, 14-190 for 14 tons-190 hp, and 16-220 for 16 tons-220 hp). Third generation (2003–2010) Chevrolet Kodiak C5500 in use as a bus on Maui For 2003, General Motors released the third-generation Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick under the GMT560 architecture. As General Motors felt the two names had better marketplace recognition, the medium-duty truck line was released under the previous Kodiak/TopKick nameplates, with Cx500 as a secondary part of the nomenclature. Showcased as part of the redesign was a change in the design layout of the Kodiak/TopKick. To better compete with the better-selling International DuraStar and Freightliner Business Class M2 medium-duty truck ranges, the GMT560 trucks switched to a vertically-oriented cab configuration to allow for a lower cab floor, increased cab space, and better entry and exit. Derived from the Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana full-size van, the cab was produced in two-door and four-door configurations (as the commercial trucks had a GVWR of over 8500 pounds, they were produced without airbags). During its production, the GMT560 was produced with few changes. With the exception of grilles, Kodiaks and TopKicks are nearly identical; depending on trim, versions are produced with either two or four headlights. Carried over from the previous generation, the GMT560 chassis was produced in Class 5-7 configurations, in C4500, C5500, C6500, and C7500 models. Effectively, a successor to the GMC Brigadier, a tandem-axle C8500 model was introduced (with up to a 46,000-lb GVWR). On the GMT560 Kodiak/TopKick, the powertrain configuration was derived from the model specification. On C4500/C5500s, an 8.1L V8 was carried over from the previous generation, with a 6.6L Duramax V8 diesel replacing the Caterpillar 3116. Diesel engines were standard on C6500s and up, with the 7.8L Duramax LG4 inline-6 as standard, with a 7.2L Caterpillar C7 (a redesigned Caterpillar 3126) offered as an option. = GMT560 four-wheel drive = In 2005, GM added four-wheel drive as a factory-installed option on C4500/C5500 Kodiak/TopKicks. In a break from GM truck naming tradition, the models did not adopt the \\"K\\" nomenclature, becoming the C4500/5500 4x4 model line. In place of independent front suspension (used on the 3500-series pickup trucks), the GMT560 4x4s used a solid front axle suspension. Powered by a 6.6L Duramax V8, the 4x4 used a 5-speed Allison 2000 series in 2005-2006 (replaced by a 6-speed Allison 2350 automatic) with a New Process 273C transfer case. 5.13:1 was the only axle gear ratio offered for 4x4 versions. For 2007, GM introduced a heavier-duty 9000 lb spring and brake option package for the Dana 70HD front axle; rear axles (Dana S14-110L) were available in four sizes: 11,000 lb, 13,500 lb, 15,000 lb, and 19,000 lb (the latter two were options on two-wheel drive configurations). =Isuzu H-Series= For 2003, Isuzu released a conventional- cab truck, named the Isuzu H-Series. Intended largely for vocational use, the Isuzu H-Series was marketed as a competitor for the Hino 600 and Freightliner M2. Based on the Kodiak/TopKick C6500/C7500, the H-Series differed solely in its grille design, sharing the 7.8L Duramax inline-six with the C6500/7500 and the Chevrolet/GMC T6500/7500 (based on the Isuzu Forward). As of the 2018 model year, the H-Series is the first (and only) conventional-cab truck sold by Isuzu. Discontinuation In December 2007, GM announced its intention to sell its medium-duty truck business, including the Kodiak and TopKick, to Navistar International. In August 2008, both GM and Navistar announced that their memorandum of understanding for the purchase had expired and was not renewed.http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=5&docid;=47990 After four years of working with multiple potential buyers, including an anticipated five-year deal with Isuzu Motors announced late in January 2009 to take over the production line in Flint, Michigan,http://www.detnews.com/article/20090609/AUTO01/906090330 General Motors decided to wind down its medium-duty truck operations. Production of the Chevy Kodiak and GMC TopKick medium duty trucks in Flint ceased on July 31, 2009. The Montreal plant also closed on July 31, 2009. Successor At the 2018 Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, General Motors launched a new line of medium-duty trucks for the 2019 model year. Developed in a joint venture with Navistar International, Chevrolet launched the Chevrolet Silverado 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD (for Classes 4,5, and 6, respectively), produced by Navistar as the International CV. In a shift from previous generations of medium-duty trucks, the model line is sold exclusively by Chevrolet, as GMC is shifting towards away from commercial fleet sales and focusing its premium Denali model lines. In another break from tradition, the Kodiak nameplate was retired; with the exception of the Colorado mid-size pickup and Low Cab Forward (Isuzu Elf/NPR), all Chevrolet trucks use the Silverado nameplate. Sharing its cab with the Silverado K2XX, the medium-duty Silverado/International CV receives its own chassis with a tilt-forward hood; both 4x2 and 4x4 configurations are produced. As of current production, the model line is offered with a 350 hp 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8; the engine is paired with an Allison automatic transmission.http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2017/09/chevrolet- confirms-2019-silverado-45005500.html Variants =School bus= Blue Bird/GMC school bus Following in the tradition of its medium-duty C/K predecessor, the second-generation Kodiak/TopKick was utilized by General Motors to supply the school bus industry throughout its production run. In an unusual move at the time, starting in 1992, GM offered the Kodiak/TopKick solely to a single body manufacturer, Blue Bird Corporation from 1992 to 2002. While the GM chassis was not offered to other manufacturers, Blue Bird offered other available combinations (Ford B700, International 3800, and the later Freightliner FS65) for an additional price. The pairing of manufacturer and chassis supplier would become common through the 1990s in school bus manufacturing, but after 2002, General Motors would become unable to remain a chassis supplier. The Kodiak/TopKick school bus chassis is also notable for being one of the last full-size school bus chassis powered by a gasoline engine. =Pickup conversion= Chevrolet Kodiak C4500 with a 5th-wheel trailer-towing rear utility/pickup body A special Kodiak C4500 was introduced at the 2006 Chicago Auto Show. Aimed at the International RXT (also introduced there), pricing was set at $70,000. The two shared a number of similarities, such as the options included in their premium packages (a powerful audio system and DVD-based navigation system). In comparison, the C4500 had higher power (300 hp versus 230 hp) while the RXT had a higher towing capacity at ; the C4500 was a 4x4 like the larger International CXT. A conversion of the commercial GMC TopKick called the Ultimate Class IV TopKick Pickup crew cab pickup truck was developed by General Motors and Monroe Truck Equipment (MTE). This special version features an steel dually pickup box and tailgate with custom composite side panels and protective Rhino interior lining. This vehicle serves as the alternate mode for the character Ironhide in the first three Transformers films. =Cadillac One= \\"Cadillac One\\", a one-of-a-kind Cadillac body mounted on the GMT560 chassis. (2018 version) Since 2009, the United States Presidential State Car has become labeled \\"Cadillac One\\"; as a result of its massive size, it is also nicknamed \\"The Beast\\". Corresponding to its use by the Secret Service, many details about the vehicle remain classified. While its chassis specifications were never revealed by Cadillac or the Secret Service, the vehicle was developed alongside GMC TopKicks on the GMC560 platform. In place of previous limousines, the highly armored vehicle is not based upon a production Cadillac model line, instead wearing a one-of- a-kind body (borrowing components from Cadillac vehicles). Entering service in 2018, a second generation of \\"Cadillac One\\" limousines entered service. Wearing an updated version of Cadillac bodywork (though again not derived from a specific model line), the vehicle is again derived from a medium-duty GMT560 diesel truck chassis. While nearly all vehicle specifications remain secret, its weight is estimated to be 15,000–20,000 pounds. External links *Car and Driver road tests for the C4500.

Aside from his artwork, Jōkei left little record of his life, so sorting out the details of his biography is difficult. The fact that two men by that name were working in Nara in the 13th century only complicates matters.Mason 192. Jōkei probably began his career as a disciple of Kōkei, the organizer of the Kei school of sculpture, or of Unkei. In fact, Jōkei may even have been Kōkei's son, though others call him the son of Unkei.Paine 110.Noma 272. In this capacity, he sculpted works for the reconstruction of the temples Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji in Nara. Jōkei followed the lead of Unkei and others in the Kei school in his pursuit of realism. An early example of this is his Guardian King (Niō), carved sometime in the 1190s. The figure stands beside another by Unkei at the main gateway in front of the Kōfuku-ji. Jōkei's Niō is nude to the waist, exposing a tense musculature. The veins in the neck and head are engorged, only heightening the figure's expression of rage. The pose is action- ortiented, as if the king is in the midst of a fight.Noma 103. The figures of Yuima (Sanskrit: Vimalakirti) and Monju (Sanskrit: Manjushri) in the East kōndō of Kōfuku-ji also show Jōkei's interpretation of the Kei aesthetic. The debate between these two men had been the subject of earlier Japanese sculpture, but Jōkei's depiction is different and subject to interpretation. Some see his Yuima as strong and healthy, while others view the figure as aged and ill in keeping with his description in the Vimalikirtinirdesha Sutra.Noma 85. The work also indicates that Jōkei was familiar with the Buddhist sculpture of Song China. His Yuima sits on a pedestal, which is decorated with an elaborately carved lion. The sculpture's high wooden backing, carved to look as if it is covered in cloth, is another Chinese element.Mason 193.

Generalized n-gons encompass as special cases projective planes (generalized triangles, n = 3) and generalized quadrangles (n = 4). Many generalized polygons arise from groups of Lie type, but there are also exotic ones that cannot be obtained in this way. Generalized polygons satisfying a technical condition known as the Moufang property have been completely classified by Tits and Weiss. Every generalized n-gon with n even is also a near polygon. Definition A generalized 2-gon (or a digon) is an incidence structure with at least 2 points and 2 lines where each point is incident to each line. For n \\\\geq 3 a generalized n-gon is an incidence structure (P,L,I), where P is the set of points, L is the set of lines and I\\\\subseteq P\\\\times L is the incidence relation, such that: * It is a partial linear space. * It has no ordinary m-gons as subgeometry for 2 \\\\leq m < n. * It has an ordinary n-gon as a subgeometry. * For any \\\\\\\\{A_1, A_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq P \\\\cup L there exists a subgeometry ( P', L', I' ) isomorphic to an ordinary n-gon such that \\\\\\\\{A_1, A_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq P' \\\\cup L' . An equivalent but sometimes simpler way to express these conditions is: consider the bipartite incidence graph with the vertex set P \\\\cup L and the edges connecting the incident pairs of points and lines. * The girth of the incidence graph is twice the diameter n of the incidence graph. From this it should be clear that the incidence graphs of generalized polygons are Moore graphs. A generalized polygon is of order (s,t) if: * all vertices of the incidence graph corresponding to the elements of L have the same degree s + 1 for some natural number s; in other words, every line contains exactly s + 1 points, * all vertices of the incidence graph corresponding to the elements of P have the same degree t + 1 for some natural number t; in other words, every point lies on exactly t + 1 lines. We say a generalized polygon is thick if every point (line) is incident with at least three lines (points). All thick generalized polygons have an order. The dual of a generalized n-gon (P,L,I), is the incidence structure with notion of points and lines reversed and the incidence relation taken to be the converse relation of I. It can easily be shown that this is again a generalized n-gon. Examples * The incidence graph of a generalized digon is a complete bipartite graph Ks+1,t+1. * For any natural n ≥ 3, consider the boundary of the ordinary polygon with n sides. Declare the vertices of the polygon to be the points and the sides to be the lines, with set inclusion as the incidence relation. This results in a generalized n-gon with s = t = 1. * For each group of Lie type G of rank 2 there is an associated generalized n-gon X with n equal to 3, 4, 6 or 8 such that G acts transitively on the set of flags of X. In the finite case, for n=6, one obtains the Split Cayley hexagon of order (q, q) for G2(q) and the twisted triality hexagon of order (q3, q) for 3D4(q3), and for n=8, one obtains the Ree-Tits octagon of order (q, q2) for 2F4(q) with q = 22n+1. Up to duality, these are the only known thick finite generalized hexagons or octagons.  Restriction on parameters  Walter Feit and Graham Higman proved that finite generalized n-gons of order (s, t) with s ≥ 2, t ≥ 2 can exist only for the following values of n: :2, 3, 4, 6 or 8. Generalized \\"n\\"-gons for these values are referred to as generalized digons, triangles, quadrangles, hexagons and octagons. When Feit-Higman theorem is combined with the Haemers-Roos inequalities, we get the following restrictions, * If n = 2, the incidence graph is a complete bipartite graph and thus \\"s\\", \\"t\\" can be arbitrary integers. * If n = 3, the structure is a finite projective plane, and s = t. * If n = 4, the structure is a finite generalized quadrangle, and t1/2 ≤ s ≤ t2. * If n = 6, then st is a square, and t1/3 ≤ s ≤ t3. * If n = 8, then 2st is a square, and t1/2 ≤ s ≤ t2. * If s or t is allowed to be 1 and the structure is not the ordinary n-gon then besides the values of n already listed, only n = 12 may be possible. Every known finite generalized hexagon of order (s, t) for s, t > 1 has order * (q, q): the split Cayley hexagons and their duals, * (q3, q): the twisted triality hexagon, or * (q, q3): the dual twisted triality hexagon, where q is a prime power. Every known finite generalized octagon of order (s, t) for s, t > 1 has order *(q, q2): the Ree- Tits octagon or *(q2, q): the dual Ree-Tits octagon, where q is an odd power of 2.  Semi-finite generalized polygons  If s and t are both infinite then generalized polygons exist for each n greater or equal to 2. It is unknown whether or not there exist generalized polygons with one of the parameters finite (and bigger than 1) while the other infinite (these cases are called semi-finite). Peter Cameron proved the non-existence of semi-finite generalized quadrangles with three points on each line, while Andries Brouwer and Bill Kantor independently proved the case of four points on each line. The non-existence result for five points on each line was proved by G. Cherlin using Model Theory. No such results are known without making any further assumptions for generalized hexagons or octagons, even for the smallest case of three points on each line. Combinatorial applications As noted before the incidence graphs of generalized polygons have important properties. For example, every generalized n-gon of order (s,s) is a (s+1,2n) cage. They are also related to expander graphs as they have nice expansion properties. Several classes of extremal expander graphs are obtained from generalized polygons. In Ramsey theory, graphs constructed using generalized polygons give us some of the best known constructive lower bounds on offdiagonal Ramsey numbers.

With his accomplices, who have been unknown since, he planned the robbery at the Legs of Man public house in Wigan. They then persuaded the ostler at the Bull's Head Inn in Upholland to lend them horses for a few hours. They held up the Liverpool mail coach at nearby Tawd Vale on the River Tawd, firing two shots and forcing the driver to pull up so that they could rob the passengers. The gang then returned to the Bull's Head, and when the robbed coach later arrived at the inn, Lyon and his accomplices had an alibi as people had seen them in the pub earlier in the afternoon. In addition to this robbery, Lyon was a habitual thief, and had been transported to one of the colonies for some years before returning to Upholland. Local legend suggests Lyon was inept at highway robbery. It is said that he decided to hold up the coach taking the wages to a local coal mine but on the day of his intended crime it was pouring with rain. He stood out to stop the coach too early and the rain ruined the gunpowder in his pistol - the coach's driver, perhaps realising this, simply coaxed the horses into a run and soaked Lyon with muddy water as they flew past. Arrest and execution Grave of George Lyon and daughter Nanny George Lyon was 54 when he was executed in Lancaster by hanging for robbery, as the last highwayman to be hanged there. Sentence was passed on Saturday 8 April 1815 along with two accomplices, Houghton and Bennett. A fourth accomplice was Edward Ford, who had been working as a painter at Walmsley House, where the last robbery took place and for which Lyon and his accomplices were eventually indicted. Ford had suggested robbing the house to Lyon, and had himself taken part in some 17 previous robberies, but because he turned King's evidence he was spared the capital sentence. The execution of Lyon, Houghton, and Bennett, took place just before noon on Saturday 22 April 1815. All capital sentences passed that day were commuted, except for the Upholland trio of Lyon, Houghton and Bennett, and two others, Moses Owen for horse stealing, and John Warburton for \\"highway robbery\\". After his death Lyon's body was handed over to Simon Washington, landlord of The Old Dog Inn in Upholland, and a companion, for its return to Upholland for burial (the inn building still stands on Alma Hill in the village). Lyon had not wanted his body left at Lancaster as it would have been handed over to surgeons for dissection as was the normal procedure with the bodies of executed criminals. In a letter to his wife written on 14 April (with the aid of the prison chaplain, the Reverend Cowley), he implored her to arrange for his body to be returned home. As the cart approached the final part of its journey, a huge crowd was observed moving off from Orrell Post near Upholland in the direction of Gathurst, to observe the return of Lyon's body. When word came through that the cortege was instead passing through nearby Wrightington and heading for the road through Appley Bridge instead, the crowd rushed across the fields from the Gathurst Bridge which still spans the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, to meet the cart at Dangerous Corner, and then followed it in procession through Appley Bridge, and up the climb through Roby Mill, until it eventually reached Parliament Street in Upholland, and the last few hundred yards to The Old Dog Inn, where Lyon's body was laid out in the landlady's best parlour overnight. Hundreds of people gathered outside the pub the next day, and even climbed onto the roofs of adjoining buildings, to see the coffin as it was taken for burial to St. Thomas's churchyard in Upholland on Sunday 23 April 1815. George Lyon was buried in his daughter's grave (not, as is traditionally believed, that of his mother or grandmother), the inscription simply reads \\"Nanny Lyon, Died April 7th 1804\\". His name is not recorded on the stone. 1761 births 1815 deaths People from Up Holland English highwaymen Executed people from Lancashire People executed for robbery 19th-century executions by England and Wales 1810s crimes in the United Kingdom ","title":"George Lyon (highwayman)"},{"id":"4027400","text":"William Joseph Holland (March 3, 1874 – November 20, 1930) was an American track and field athlete.

He was Vladimir Lenin's personal secretary.The Russian Civil War by Evan Mawdsley, Birlinn, 2008 He was a brother of the Soviet scientist Mikhail Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich. Early life Younger Vladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich Vladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich was born in Moscow to a land surveyor family who came from the Mogilev province and belonged to the nobility of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At the age of ten, he was sent to the Moscow Institute of Surveying and graduated from the school of land surveying. In 1889, he was arrested for taking part in a student demonstration, and banished to Kursk.He returned to Moscow in 1892 and entered the \\"Moscow Workers' Union\\" and distributed illegal literature. From 1895 he was active in the social- democratic circles. In 1896 he emigrated to Switzerland and organized shipments of Russian revolutionary literature and printing equipment and became an active member of Iskra. Researching dissenters and supporting Doukhobors One of Bonch-Bruyevich's research interests were Russia's dissenting religious minorities (\\"sects\\"), which were usually persecuted to various extent by both the established Orthodox Church and the Tsarist government. He believed that Baptists and Flagellants were \\"transmission points\\" for revolutionary propaganda. During the 1917 revolutions, he is reputed to have played a crucial in neutralising the Cossack garrison in the capital, Petrograd, through his contacts in the New Israel and Old Israel sects. He also met Grigori Rasputin, but judged that he was an Orthodox christian, not sectarian. In the late 1890s, he collaborated with Vladimir Chertkov and Leo Tolstoy,O.A. Golinenko (О.А. ГОЛИНЕНКО) \\"Leo Tolstoy's questions to a Doukhobor\\" (ВОПРОСЫ Л.Н. ТОЛСТОГО ДУХОБОРУ) in particular in the arrangement of the Doukhobors' emigration to Canada in 1899. Bonch- Bruyevich sailed with the Doukhobors, and spent a year with them in Canada. During that time, he was able to record much of their orally transmitted tradition, in particular the Doukhobor \\"psalms\\" (hymns). He published them later (1909) as \\"The Doukhobor Book of Life\\" (, Zhivotnaya Kniga Dukhobortsev). Н. В. Сомин. «Духоборы» В.Д. Бонч-Бруевич, Животная книга духоборцев, Санкт-Петербург, 1909. (The Doukhobor Book of Life — Complete Russian book at www.archive.org) Political activism When the RSDLP split in 1903 between the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, and the Mensheviks, Bonch- Bruyevich was among the original Bolsheviks. He helped bring out the RSDLP newspaper Iskra while it was still under Lenin's control, and backed Lenin during 1904, when it appeared he might be losing control of the Bolsheviks to conciliators who wanted to heal the split. In December 1904, he helped organise Vpered, the first Bolshevik newspaper. According to Lenin's widow \\"Bonch-Bruyeich was in charge of the business side. He permanently beamed, concocted divers grandiose plans, and was always dashing around on printing- press matters.\\" He also helped set up and run the party archive. Bonch- Bruyevich returned to Russia early in 1905, and for a time worked illegally for the Bolsheviks in St Petersburg, organising the underground storage of weapons. After the 1905 revolution, he was able to operate legally. In 1906, he organised the Bolsheviks' weekly newspaper Наша мысль (Nasha mysl - Our Beliefs), the journal Вестник жизни (Vestnik zhizni - Herald of Life) and several other publications. From 1907, he headed the Bolshevik publishing house, Жизнь и знание (Zhizn i znanie - Life and Knowledge). From 1912 he was a member of the editorial board of the newspaper Pravda. During this time he was repeatedly arrested, but did not serve a long prison sentence. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov and Vladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich at the Kremlin in 1918 On the outbreak of the February Revolution, in 1917, Bonch-Bruyevich founded the newspaper Izvestya, and used it in April as a vehicle to defend Lenin's decision to return to Russia through Germany, despite the two countries being at war. He was dismissed from the staff by the Menshevik- controlled Petrograd soviet in May for using it to disseminate Bolshevik propaganda. During June and July 1917, Bolshevik party meetings were held at his dacha, to avoid the attention of the police. In August, the head of the provisional government, Alexander Kerensky ordered his arrest, and he went into hiding. During the October Revolution, he was in charge of protecting the Bolshevik party headquarters in the Smolny Institute, in Petrograd. Bonch- Bruyevich was head of administration for the Council of People's Commissars (equivalent to head of Lenin's private office) from November 1917 to October 1920. Between December 1917 and March 1918 he was the chairman of the Committee against the pogroms and in February – March 1918 a member of the Committee for the Revolutionary Defense of Petrograd. From 1918 he was Deputy Chairman of the Board of Medical Colleges. In 1919 he was Chairman of the Committee for the construction of sanitary checkpoints at railway stations in Moscow and the Special Committee for Rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation in Moscow. Between 1918–1919 he was the head of the publishing house of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) \\"Kommunist.\\" Vladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich (fourth from left), Council of People's Commissars, early 1918 Bonch-Bruevich took an active part in the nationalization of the banks in the preparation of the Soviet government moving to Moscow in March 1918. In 1918 as Managing Director of the Council of the People's Commissars, he endorsed setting in motion the Red Terror. In 1918 he was elected a member of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences. After Lenin's death, he did research and authored works on the history of the revolutionary movement in Russia, the history of religion and atheism, sectarianism, ethnography and literature. In the Soviet Union, Bonch-Bruyevich was best known as the author of a canonical Soviet book about Vladimir Lenin, whom Bonch-Bruyevich served as secretary in the years immediately following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.\\"The Cheka: Lenin's Political Police\\", NY, Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 197 Following Lenin's death, Bonch-Bruevich was one of the key people involved in organising the funeral. He personally opposed the mummification of Lenin's body. Between 1920 and 1929 he was the organizer and leader of a farm that supplied its products mostly to the leaders of the Communist party and the government. Beginning in 1933, he was the director of the State Literary Museum in Moscow. Between 1946 and 1953 he was the director of the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Leningrad. Bonch-Bruyevich died on 14 July 1955. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Bonch-Bruyevich's daughter, Yelena, married Leopold Averbakh. After her husband's arrest, she was sentenced to seven years in the labour camps.

In the U.S. commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a borough (sometimes spelled boro) is a self-governing municipal entity, best thought of as a town, usually smaller than a city, but with a similar population density in its residential areas. Sometimes thought of as \\"junior cities\\", boroughs generally have fewer powers and responsibilities than full-fledged cities. Description All municipalities in Pennsylvania are classified as either cities, boroughs, or townships. The only exception is the town of Bloomsburg, recognized by the state government as the only incorporated town in Pennsylvania. Boroughs tend to have more developed business districts and concentrations of public and commercial office buildings, including court houses. Boroughs are larger, less spacious, and more developed than the relatively rural townships, which often have the greater territory and even surround boroughs of a related or even the same name. There are 958 boroughs and 56 cities in Pennsylvania. Many home rule municipalities remain classified as boroughs or townships for certain purposes even if the state's Borough and Township Codes no longer apply to them.

He was an alumnus of the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud. SFIO Active in the Syndicat National des Instituteurs (SNI), a staunch supporter of laïcité and a pacifist after service in World War I, Pivert joined the faction of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) led by Léon Blum, which opposed affiliation to the Comintern in 1920, as opposed to the new French Communist Party (PCF). In the early 1930s, Pivert organised the most left-wing members of the SFIO in his Gauche Révolutionnaire (\\"Revolutionary Left\\") tendency of which Daniel Guérin was a member. The tendency opened itself to Trotskyism, initiating entryism as a tactic for the latter. In 1936, when Blum formed the Popular Front government, he was pressured by Pivert to reject capitalism. With spontaneous strikes occurring around the country, Blum refused to allow for revolutionary conditions to arise. Pivert then wrote his best-known article, published on 27 May, headlined Tout est possible! (\\"Everything Is Possible\\"), alluding to a social revolution (but never to a socialist one). However, he was opposed by the communist press organ L'Humanité (the PCF was a backer of the Blum government). The communist editorial read: Non! Tout n'est pas possible! (\\"No! Everything Is Not Possible!\\"). In consequence, Pivert cut his links with the government, writing to Blum, \\"I will not accept capitulation in front of Capitalism and the banks\\". Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party The Gauche révolutionnaire left the SFIO to establish the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan or PSOP), awkwardly between socialists and Stalinism. In fact, its ideology fluctuated from Marxist orthodoxy to a radical version of reformism. The PSOP was part of the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre. In 1940, it was outlawed after the fall of France to Nazi Germany, on orders of Vichy French leader Philippe Pétain. Pivert exiled himself to Mexico and supported the French Resistance. Back in France after World War II, he saw the PSOP divided between some, who joined the PCF, and others, like him, who joined the SFIO. Return to SFIO He became more moderate inside the SFIO, and his audience was curtailed. Pivert was regularly elected to the party leadership but was for Algeria's independence and against the European Defence Community, both against the line taken by the majority of the party. He rebelled against the party further after taking part in a delegation that visited the Soviet Union and so was voted out of his position in the party leadership. According to some, Pivert would have joined the new Parti Socialiste Autonome (PSA) created by Édouard Depreux and Alain Savary, but he died before the new party split from the SFIO. However, most of his followers in the SFIO entered the PSA later in 1958.

From 1629 to 1630, Billy taught mathematics at the Jesuit College at Pontà Mousson. He was still studying theology at this time. From 1631 to 1633, Billy taught mathematics at the Jesuit college at Rheims. From 1665 to 1668 he was professor of mathematics at the Jesuit college at Dijon. One of his pupils there was Jacques Ozanam. Billy also taught in Grenoble. He also served as rector of a number of Jesuit Colleges in Châlons-en-Champagne, Langres and in Sens. The mathematician Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac, who had been a pupil of Billy's at Rheims, became a close friend. Billy maintained a correspondence with the mathematician Pierre de Fermat. Work and legacy Billy produced a number of results in number theory which have been named after him. Bachet introduced Billy to indeterminate analysis. Billy's mathematical works include Diophantus Redivivus. In the field of astronomy, he published several astronomical tables. First published in Dijon by Pierre Palliot in 1656, Billy's tables of eclipses is called Tabulae Lodoicaeae seu universa eclipseon doctrina tabulis, praeceptis ac demonstrationibus explicata. Adiectus est calculus, aliquot eclipseon solis & lunae, quae proxime per totam Europam videbuntur. The tables were calculated for the years 1656 to 1693. This work also contains solar and lunar tables based on the Paris meridian. It also includes a detailed examination of problems involved in astronomical calculations. Billy was one of the first scientists to reject the role of astrology in science. He also rejected old notions about the malevolent influence of comets. He died at Dijon.

It is four miles east of Portrush and two miles west of the Giant's Causeway. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 734 people, a decline of 10% compared to 1991. It lies within the Causeway Coast and Glens District Council area. History Portballintrae from the A2 road to Bushmills. Portballintrae was originally a fishing village; a cluster of whitewashed cottages nestled around the horse shoe-shaped Ballintrae Bay. Many of its earlier buildings have been restored and maintained. The original village houses were built in a line along the seashore and many old cottages still stand on the shore. Portballintrae has undergone rapid growth since the 1970s. However, there has been a steady change in its character, with almost all the recent dwellings completed acquired as second homes, and a considerable proportion of the older housing changing also to second homes. Considerably less than half of the dwellings in the village remain as permanent residences. House prices are high; a modest three bedroom bungalow would be expected to realise anything up to £300,000, those with sea views realise considerably more than this. In the summer of 2009, a new village hall was constructed by the seafront car park, complete with conference suite, IT facilities, and a newsagents. =Donald Trump= In 2007 Portballintrae was considered as a location for a proposed £1 billion golf course complex by American tycoon and future American president Donald Trump. =Armada= Off the coast of Portballintrae a team of Belgian divers brought up the greatest find of Spanish Armada treasure ever recovered from a wrecked ship. The Gironas recovered gold jewellery is on show in the Ulster Museum, Belfast. =Places of interest= Runkerry House as it stands today *The ruins of Dunluce Castle sit on the edge of a cliff between Portballintrae and Portrush. The castle was the main stronghold of the MacDonnell chiefs of Antrim. *Much of Portballintrae and its surrounding area is owned by the Macnaghten family of Dundarave House and Runkerry House. Runkerry, once the home of Lord Macnaghten has since been converted into a series of apartments. *The Giant's Causeway Tramway runs through the sand dunes above the largest beach in Portballintrae, commonly known as Runkerry Strand, and Bushfoot Golf Club. This railway, popular with tourists runs between The Giants Causeway and Bushmills. 2001 Census Portballintrae is classified as a small village or hamlet by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 500 and 1,000 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 734 people living in Portballintrae.

It lets athletes compete in bad weather without serious performance loss and improves their results over other surfaces. It also provides a more consistent surface for competition even under optimum weather. Such tracks have become the standard for most elite competitions. Because the \\"Tartan\\" brand name was the first and was widely successful in its time, the name Tartan has been used as a genericized trademark for description of an all-weather running track.  History  The 1968 Summer Olympics at Mexico City was the first Olympic Games to use the Tartan track surface in athletics. Olympic shot put champion Bill Nieder and American record holder in the mile Don Bowden were instrumental in developing the product and selling it for use in the 1968 Olympics.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2008_11_05_14_38_11 American track and field coach Bert Bonanno, who had been recruited by the Mexican Olympic Committee to help prepare their athletes, worked as a liaison between the Mexican officials and manufacturer 3M in 1968. “It had been red cinder at the Olympic Games up until then. 3M hired Jesse Owens to assist them to convince the Mexican Olympic Committee to put that track in,” Bonanno said. A Tartan track was constructed for the men's U.S. Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, California, west of South Lake Tahoe. Just off U.S. Route 50, it was built in the summer of 1968 in the parking lot of Nebelhorn ski area, at an elevation of . The original trade name \\"Tartan\\" came from 3M, manufacturers of Scotch Tape and continuing the Scotch name tradition. 3M's first generation artificial turf of the late 1960s and early 1970s was branded as \\"Tartan Turf.\\" Those original tracks required mercury as a catalyst, later found to be an environmental hazard. An independent company has perfected the process without mercury. There are now numerous competitors in the \\"all-weather track\\" industry. In fact, the \\"Tartan\\" tracks of the late 1960s were the second generation of all-weather track surfacing. Before that, there were several tracks constructed of rubber (usually tire shavings) and asphalt. The first recorded use of a Tartan Track surface in competition in England was a long jump at the Norman Green Sports Centre in Solihull, September 16, 1967, though there were earlier uses in the United States.

(Kerch, Crimea) A prytaneion () was seat of the prytaneis (executive), and so the seat of government in ancient Greece. The term is used to describe any of a range of ancient structures where officials met (normally relating to the government of a city) but the term is also used to refer to the building where the officials and winners of the Olympic games met at Olympia. The prytaneion normally stood in centre of the city, in the agora. In general in ancient Greece, each state, city or village possessed its own central hearth and sacred fire, the prytaneum, representing the unity and vitality of the community. The fire was kept alight continuously, tended by the king or members of his family. The building in which this fire was kept was the prytaneum, and the chieftain (the king or prytanis) probably made it his residence. The building contained the holy fire of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, and symbol of the life of the city. The word prytanis (pl. prytaneis) is generally applied specially to those who, after the abolition of absolute monarchy, held the chief office in the state. Rulers of this name are found at Rhodes as late as the 1st century B.C. There was also a court of justice called the court of the prytaneum; all that is known of this court is that it tried murderers who could not be found, and inanimate objects which had caused death. Judging from its rather fanciful functions and from its name, it was probably a relic of the archaic jurisdiction of the patriarch-king. Function The prytaneum was regarded as the religious and political center of the community and was thus the nucleus of all government, and the official \\"home\\" of the whole people. When members of the state went forth to found a new colony they took with them a brand from the prytaneum altar to kindle the new fire in the colony; the fatherless daughters of Aristides, who were regarded as children of the state at Athens, were married from the prytaneum as from their home; Thucydides informs us2.15 that in the Synoecism of Theseus the prytanea of all the separate communities were joined in the central prytaneum of Athens as a symbol of the union; and foreign ambassadors and citizens who had deserved especially well of the state were entertained in the prytaneum as public guests. This is the function that Socrates referred to in Plato's Apology when he said that instead of death he should be sentenced to be cared for in the prytaneum. Polemon of Athens said that copies of the laws of Solon were kept in the prytaneum, engraved on square wooden tablets which revolved on pivots in such a way that when the tablets were turned at an angle they seemed to be triangular. Pausanias says briefly that the laws of Solon were inscribed in the prytaneum. Athens The site of the prytaneum at Athens cannot be definitely fixed; it is generally supposed that in the course of time several buildings bore the name. The prytaneum, mentioned by Pausanias, and probably the original center of the ancient city, was situated somewhere east of the northern cliff of the Acropolis. Hence, the frequent confusion with the Tholos, which was near the council chamber and was the residence of the prytaneis of the council. Ernst Curtius places the original prytaneum south of the Acropolis in the Old Agora, speaks of a second identical with the Tholos in the Kerameikos, and regards that of Pausanias as a building of Roman times. Charles Wachsmuth holds the former view and regards the Tholos as merely a dining-room for the prytaneum in the old democratic period. Many authorities hold that the original Prytaneum of the Cecropian city must have been on the Acropolis. From Aristotle's Constitution of AthensCh. 3 we know that the Prytaneum was the official residence of the Archons, but, when the New Agora was constructed by Peisistratus, they took their meals in the Thesmotheteum for the sake of convenience. Geoffrey Schmalz suggested in 2006 that the Prytaneum should be identified with some of the ruins in St. Catherine's Square, not far from the Lysicrates Monument.https://www.academia.edu/7519066/The_Athenian_Prytaneion_Discovered Following the unearthing of an inscription mentioning the Prytaneion, George Kavvadias and Angelos Matthaiou argued in 2014 that it was somewhat to the north and west of the location suggested by Schmalz.https://www.academia.edu/9223744/G_Kavvadias_- _A.P._Matthaiou_A_new_Attic_inscription_of_the_fifth_cent._B.C._from_the_East_Slope_of_the_Acropolis_ Achaea In Achaea, this central hall was called the Lefton (town-hall), and a similar building is known to have existed at Elis.

Since this prayer became traditional the owner of the ranch, Protassio de Souza, had structures of palm built to shelter the pilgrims. Nevertheless, Isidoro Teixeira, the first settler to build his house there, is considered to be the founder of the town. In 1885 the first house covered by tiles was built and the village was called Boa Vista. Later it was changed to Iracema. In 1887 the village was raised to the category of district with the name Iaciara, an Indian word of unknown origin. In 1958 Iaciara was dismembered from Posse and became a municipality.

It was made by the Athenian sculptor Leochares in celebration of Philip's victory at the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC). It was the only structure inside the Altis dedicated to a human. The temple consisted of an outer colonnade of Ionic order with 18 columns. Inside, it had nine engaged half-columns of the lavishly- designed Corinthian order. It had a diameter of 15 metres. The naos contains two windows, much like Hera II at Paestum. It had a carved marble roof which was decorated with a bronze poppy head on top. A brief history of the Olympic games By David C. Young Page 125 The importance of the chryselephantine material used is that it was also the material used for the statue of Zeus also at Olympia (Comparing the Macedonian royal family to the gods). The fact Alexander is represented here is also important, as Philip had seven wives so after his death there very well could have been claims to the throne by people other than Alexander. By putting Alexander in the statue it makes it clear who his successor should be. It is however disputed whether or not Philip constructed this monument or whether Alexander had it constructed later in which case the motives would be different.

After the war, Lorenz was sentenced to prison for crimes against humanity in 1948. He was released in 1955 and died in 1974. Early life He was born Grünhof (now in Gmina Postomino, Sławno County) near Stolp, Pomerania. His father was a forest warden. In 1909 Lorenz went to Military school. He served in World War I first as a cavalry officer then as a pilot in the Luftstreitkräfte. After the war he worked as a border guard and as farmer. He later acquired land and industrial property in Danzig. Through his daughter Rosemarie, Lorenz would become Axel Springer's father-in-law. Nazi Party and SS career In 1929 Lorenz joined the Nazi Party and the SS in 1931. Two years later he had an active political role as a member of the Landtag in the Free State of Prussia, a member of the Reichstag and worked at the Hamburg State Council. In November 1933 Lorenz was promoted to SS-Gruppenführer and lead the SS Upper Division North in Altona from 1934 until 1937. In January 1937, was promoted to head the Nazi Party agency Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VOMI) that was initially responsible for the welfare of ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) living beyond the pre-war borders of Nazi Germany. After the Second World War began, the VOMI took charge of the resettlement of ethnic Germans on captured territory, but also the \\"Germanization\\" of foreign children such as Poles and Slovenes.

In respect to his international work, Lorenz was plenipotentiary for foreign relations for Adolf Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess. Lorenz with a Chetnik officer in Bosnia, autumn 1942. In June 1941 VOMI was absorbed into the office of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) run by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. The RKFDV, as an SS-controlled organization, had the authority to say who was German, where ethnic Germans could live, and what populations should be cleared or annihilated in order to make room for the German settlers from the east Europe during action \\"Heim ins Reich\\". As RKFDV chief, Himmler authorized the Einsatzgruppen (SS death squads) and other SS police units to round up and kill Jews, Slavs and Roma. Lorenz remained in charge of Volksdeutsch settlements in these ethnically cleansed areas. He also was responsible for VOMI officials who handled the personal property seized from Jews killed during Operation Reinhard in the General Government during 1942-1943. In late 1942 Lorenz was seriously injured in a vehicle accident in Bosnia while overseeing the VOMI evacuation of ethnic Germans from the region. He was promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer in 1936.

Chechik and starring Willem Dafoe and Joan Cusack. It was produced by Art Linson. Premise Mickey Crews is a house detective in a seedy Florida hotel who gets involved in investigating the death of a former champion boxer. He has a romance with a former exotic dancer named Joy. Background The script was written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue who had written Scrooged (1988) for producer Art Linson. Linson had tried to get Arrive Alive made for a number of years, with a variety of stars attached, before finally securing funding with Chechick, Dafoe and Cusack. Cusack was an up-and-coming actress, working on Saturday Night Live, Dafoe was getting terrific buzz from The Last Temptation of Christ and Chechik had just directed the successful National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.Drew McWeeny, 'Saturday Night At The Movies: What exactly was 'Arrive Alive,' and what happened?', Hit Fix, 19 June 2011 accessed 14 April 2012 Filming started in April 1990.'Films Going Into Production', Los Angeles Times, 22 April 1990 However, after a week, the producers felt that the lines they had thought so funny in the script were not getting the laughs they hoped for. Shortly after arriving for location shooting in Miami, Dafoe quit due to script changes which required him to perform slapstick comedy which did not suit him. Six days later, the decision was taken to cancel production as no satisfactory replacement could be found for Dafoe and write off the $7 million cost.

NIOT is managed by a Governing Council and the Director is the head of the Institute. The institute is based in Chennai. The major aim of starting NIOT under the Ministry of Earth Sciences was to develop reliable indigenous technologies to solve various engineering problems associated with harvesting of non-living and living resources in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is about two-thirds of the land area of India. Technology Groups =Coastal and Environmental Engineering= The group functions with a mandate to develop application-oriented technologies in ocean-related (Coastal & Environmental) areas. The goals of the group are to promote programs consistent with the overall development perspective of the country in the infrastructure sector thereby contributing to the nation building exercise The group caters to specific sponsored-research and industrial sector projects by providing technical support and time-bound, result-oriented research. Coastal and Environmental Engineering (CEE) program aims to bring the state of the art technology in coastal infrastructure development through field observation, numerical modeling and engineering application. =Energy & Fresh Water= The main area of focus of this group is the utilization of the ocean resources to find alternative technologies for producing fresh water (including clean drinking water) and renewable energy. Currently the group is working on three specific areas, fresh water production using low temperature thermal desalination (LTTD) process and energy production using two distinctly different processes, ocean thermal energy conversion and wave energy. Technologies like Low Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) using coolant water discharge from thermal power plant, wave energy using floating devices such as Backward Bent Ducted Buoy (BBDB), ocean current turbine development, solar desalination, heat exchangers for LTTD and ocean thermal energy conversion are the focal areas of research. Apart from the aspect of technology development, the group has taken initiative in transferring the LTTD technology to the society through industrial partnership =Marine Sensor System= Marine Sensor Systems group was established in September 2005 to cater to the mandate of NIOT to develop and demonstrate technologies for oceans. Since then group has been concentrating on the development of different types of underwater sensor systems apart from electronic support given to the other groups in NIOT. Most of the underwater systems are acoustic based systems with underwater electronics. The group's activities have attracted several industries. Needs of NIOT are unique and all the requirements could not be met with the facilities available at NIOT earlier. Now, facilities to qualify electronics under different conditions of underwater operation have been established like, EMI/EMC analyzer, Helium Leak detector, Environment testing systems, Corrosion Chamber and Shock & Vibration testing chamber, under a single umbrella. =Marine Biotechnology= In order to develop agriculture and tourism, and to study the natural marine resources of the island groups, the Island Development Authority (IDA) was established under the chairmanship of Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India in the year of 1986. The IDA enlisted the then Department of Ocean Development (DOD), presently Ministry of Earth Sciences, as one of the implementing agencies for carrying out activities that will recuperate the socio-economic status of the island community. Based on the suggestions made by the IDA, the DOD took up several ocean related activities relevant to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and the Gulf of Mannar group of Islands in order to bring in socio-economic benefits to the island communities. =Ocean Acoustics and Modelling= The Ocean Acoustics group was formed in the 11th plan period with the aim to focus on research and development in underwater acoustics as most of the applications in the oceans rely on acoustics. Research and Development activities in the following key areas have been taken up. Three major in-house projects and few inter institutional projects are in progress. A fully automated ambient noise measurement system developed by the group is being utilized for collecting time series measurements in Indian shallow waters. The group also maintains an NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited Acoustic Test Facility for testing and calibration of underwater acoustic transducers that caters to the needs of internal groups and external institutions/organizations. =Ocean Electronics= The Ocean Electronics group was created in December 2009 and has a mandate to develop ocean observation systems and demonstrate for applications in the ocean. The group is involved in the development of Deep Ocean Bottom Pressure Recorder (DOPR) & surface buoy data logger for Tsunami Early Warning Systems, Autonomous Underwater Profiling Drifter (AUPD), and technologies for data communication using INSAT satellites. =Offshore Structures= NIOT has been developing several offshore components for various programs like desalination, mining, data buoys etc. These include pipelines/risers, moorings in deep water for small buoys as well as large vessels. The need for developing several offshore components has been felt for most of the projects handled in NIOT. The group addresses such needs. Technology Projects =Deep Sea Mining= Polymetallic nodules have economically valuable metals such as Copper, Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese in them and are viewed as potential resources to take care of the depleting land resources and increasing demand of these metals. There are more than 380 million tons of nodules in the retained Indian Pioneer area. However development of deep subsea technology for mining these resources is a major challenge considering the depth of occurrence of these nodules being 4000-6000 m, ultra high pressure environment and very low temperatures, very soft soils for supporting heavy mining equipment and difficulties in vertical transport of the harvested nodules. NIOT has been working on a mining concept where a crawler based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a high pressure slurry pump through a flexible riser system. With this perspective, the integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules. =Gas Hydrates= This group was created to cater to the sustained development of technology towards harnessing the enormous potential offered by the ocean towards the energy sectors and also to the industries related to offshore activities with particular reference to gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are crystalline combination of a natural gas and water (known technically as a clathrate) looks remarkably like ice but burns if it meets a match lit. Energy in the gas hydrates amount to twice as much as all fossil fuels combined. Gas hydrate estimated to contribute a very large amount of methane, a potential clear hydrocarbon fuel resource. =Submersibles= Development of deep-water work class ROV by NIOT in collaboration with Experimental Design Bureau of Oceanological Engineering (EDBOE), Moscow was initiated by Polymetallic Nodule Management (PMN) Board of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Govt. of India. The submersible is equipped with multifunctional tools and sensors for offshore applications such as deep ocean mineral exploration, seabed imaging, gas hydrate exploration, pipeline routing, submarine cabling, well head detection, sampling etc. Operational Programs =Ocean Observation Systems= Under the Ocean Observation Network (OON) programme of ESSO MoES, the Ocean observation systems (OOS) group of NIOT is entrusted to undertake the activities on moored buoy programme. The OOS group, erstwhile National Data Buoy Programme, was established in 1996, with the objective to operate, maintain and develop moored buoy observational networks and related telecommunication facilities in the Indian seas. Later, OOS inherited lead responsibility for a number of important and well-established observational programmes in the northern Indian Ocean. Due to the remoteness of the vast open oceans, there have been challenges to continuous observation of the ocean, which was later harmonized by in-situ and satellite based observations. =Vessel Management= The Vessel Management Cell, or 'VMC', is an operational wing of NIOT which manages the running, operation and maintenance of the fleet of MoES research vessels viz. ORV Sagar Nidhi, BTV Sagar Manjusha, CRV Sagar Purvi and CRV Sagar Paschimi. It was established in 1996, with an aim to manage two coastal research vessels, CRV Sagar Purvi and CRV Sagar Paschimi, that had been acquired by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) for assessing coastal pollution, coastal pollution monitoring, coastal surveys and near shore multidisciplinary work. In 2001, VMC committed to manage a barge, Sagar Shakthi, that was used to implement a 1MW gross pilot plant to demonstrate OTEC technology, which was the first ever such attempt in the world.

At the adoption of the new constitution around 507 , this was changed to 50 men each from the 10 newly created tribes. (Each served a one-year term) The Old Bouleuterion was built on the west side of the Agora below the Kolonos Agoraios around 500 . It was almost square and included an oblong antechamber and a main council chamber, a large rectangular room with wooden benches arranged in rows along the walls. The roof was supported by five columns. It is now better known as the Metroon (\\"House of the Mother\\") since it was repurposed as her temple after the construction of the New Bouleuterion. The New Bouleuterion was built west of the old building in the late 5th century . It was smaller but more sophisticated, with an amphitheater-like system of twelve levels of semicircular benches. Both the Old and the New Bouleuterion used the nearby Tholos.  Olympia  Bouleuterion ruins in Olympia.

Directed by Mark Mylod and produced by Alan Marke, it first aired in 1999 on BBC2. Show format While maintaining elements from The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer, Bang Bang... was very different in many ways. As with their previous sketch show, a song kicked off the proceedings, and once again the duo sat at their trademark desk. However, the desk was almost completely bare, (as opposed to their previous prop-covered ones), and had a transparent front through which the moving form of a naked man (in interviews, the duo explained that he was \\"a homunculus\\") could be seen. The studio set was different too, the huge R&M; letters replaced with large representations of the pair behind warped glass. There were also changes in their double-act dynamic. Vic's character was frequently unhinged and waved guns and large blunt objects around with relish, while Bob played a slightly baffled innocent most of the time. As usual, however, they tended to fall out easily, resulting in one of their trademark slapstick fights, which grew more absurd, violent and freeform as the series progressed. One memorable instance involved Vic's head becoming grotesquely disfigured after a spin in a tumble dryer. Bob then gleefully set about the hunchbacked, pathetic Vic with a baseball bat. There were also a number of pre-recorded sketches. These would often feature Charlie Higson, Morwenna Banks, Matt Lucas and David Walliams in supporting or cameo roles. It was a firm favourite with Vic and Bob's cult following, but confused and unsettled many new fans who had joined them after viewing their more accessible game show spoof, Shooting Stars. With this in mind, it is perhaps ironic that the duo confessed that Bang Bang... was their \\"first real attempt at making something commercial\\". Vic and Bob have said they are very proud of the show, with Bob stating: \\"We have this hope that, if there's anyone left bothered about us in fifty years' time, [Bang Bang] will be the one they'll remember\\".  Recurring sketches  =Lunch-Hour Capers (The Car Door Blokes)= These odd slapstick sketches saw the duo driving around idyllic locations, accompanied by a semi-instrumental version of \\"Zabadak\\", only to park their car between two immovable objects (trees, other parked cars, a petrol pump etc.), resulting in a protracted bout of \\"very frustrating\\" door-opening attempts, after which the duo would have to resort to other methods. Usually, at some point the car's boot or windscreen wipers would fly off and explode nearby. In these sketches, someone was always killed in a strange way, ejecting an egg from their mouths to Babybird's \\"There's Something Going On\\" before vanishing. The duo have explained that the eggs symbolise \\"their souls\\". This recurring joke even extended to the desk, where Vic accidentally shot himself with a gun, disappeared and left an egg behind, which Bob then greedily ate. Bob has described the Lunch-Hour Capers as \\"the most surreal thing we’ve ever done.\\" =Fun, Fun, Fun= Tom Fun, who had previously appeared in The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer, and his best friend Derek (revealed in the last sketch to be the former drummer of Roxy Music) were shown in these oddly touching sketches wandering around aimlessly at dawn, having been thrown out of their lodgings for generally unclear reasons involving Derek's behaviour (one example given being Derek's public attempt to eat an arctic roll \\"like a pelican might eat it\\"). Their quest to find something \\"fun\\" to do was very childlike and knew no bounds, from going down the drains, to prising up cobblestones or rooting around in a skip. In most of the sketches, Derek asks Tom \\"Is it Giro day?\\" to which he responds negatively. Each of these segments opened with the \\"fun fun fun\\" refrain from the song \\"Five Get Over Excited\\" by The Housemartins. In the last episode of the series, the pair are seen holding hands as the credits roll, walking along a beach at sunset to Roxy Music’s \\"Oh Yeah!\\". Mortimer has described the pair as \\"lovers\\". Tom Fun and Derek later appeared together (officially describing themselves as \\"partners\\" for the first time) in sketches as part of 2009 mockumentary \\"Steve Coogan: The Inside Story\\". Abandoning their Giros, they appear to have found work as disenchanted make-up artists. Derek also briefly appeared in Catterick without Tom, but decidedly more manic and obsessed with feminine hygiene products. =The Club= The main event of Bang Bang was this spoof fly-on-the-wall docu-drama, which took us behind-the-scenes of Baron's Nightclub, the \\"4th best club in Hull.\\" Paul Baron (Vic) was the dodgy proprietor who kept the premises' keys on impractically short \\"luxury chains\\" about his person. Vic and Bob have stated that despite visual similarities, Paul Baron was not modeled on famous nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Paul's previously long-lost brother Tony (Bob, with a bizarre Chinese accent) was in charge of the day-to-day running of the club, often expressing \\"serious reservations\\" about Paul's half-baked ideas. The club's compere was insane American Kinky John Fowler (Vic), whose \\"plucking peppercorns\\" routine was not one of Tony's favourites. After a disastrous \\"Erotic Night,\\" and an even more calamitous \\"Talent Night\\" (which consisted of a man with a fox on his head and a man frightening ducks with a hydraulic machine), things took a turn for the better when boy band Mandate (managed by Kinky John) played a successful set, and Paul managed to secure the services of Les Dennis for one night only. At the end of the series, a jealous Kinky John got \\"shit-faced\\" and threatened everyone with a large gun. Luckily for Kinky John, Mandate may have hit the big time in the Vic and Bob universe, as Jeff Randall (Bob) is seen singing their song \\"Touching Heaven\\" (performed in Bang Bang) in the duo's remake of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). Kinky John had previously appeared in one-off BBC2 special It’s Ulrika, written for Ulrika Jonsson by Vic and Bob in 1997. In the sketch, which also featured David Walliams and Matt Lucas, Kinky John introduced Jonsson to the stage of a Vegas-style night club. In his autobiography, Walliams describes how Kinky John’s character began to develop in lulls in recording. \\"He would wander over to the rest of us and open with ‘I’ve got a great deal. Three hundred coconuts are coming into town tonight. Are you in?’ […] What a joy to see the two funniest men in the world create something new, right in front of my eyes.\\" After debuting as a main character in Bang Bang, Kinky John featured in Vic's 2002 BBC Radio Two comedy series Vic Reeves' House Arrest as Detective Inspector John \\"Deacon\\" Fowler via an autobiography of his early life. He would return again as DI Fowler in the duo's 2004 sitcom Catterick along with the club's bouncers Carl and Chris. He also appeared in \\"Steve Coogan: The Inside Story\\" as John Fowler, Television Controller 1993-1993. Vic has said he believes the club sketches to be the inspiration for other fly-on-the-wall style comedies that emerged after Bang Bang, particularly The Office. =The Stotts= Once again, the Stotts returned, developing their celebrity interviews, which always started with \\"a little explosion\\" to \\"warm things up\\". Damon Hill was asked \\"When you are in a motor race, do you have a map, or just follow everyone else?\\". Sinéad O'Connor was given a full-frontal view of what lurked within Davey's kilt, a truly baffled Paul McKenna was asked if peanuts were soluble, Caprice was told that Davey's long pointy shoes were offered to him by the King of Spain in retribution for him \\"attacking his wife with a fish slice,\\" while Michael Winner was quizzed on whether a human could leave fingerprints on a parsnip. One recurring question that was asked, often by Donald (Bob), was whether the guest, after work or at the end of the day, had, \\"A nice relaxing poo.\\" At the end of every interview, the pair would abandon the celebrity onstage leaving them alone to the sounds of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth symphony. =\\"Never Previously Considered Funny Enough To Broadcast...\\"= A recurring series of bizarre sketch scenarios, usually involving parodies of celebrities. They were always introduced by narrator Patrick Allen, who would conclude each narration with \\"What happened that day has never previously been considered funny enough to broadcast...until now!\\" References External links  * BBC television comedy BBC television sketch shows 1999 British television series debuts 1999 British television series endings 1990s British television sketch shows English-language television shows ","title":"Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer"},{"id":"4027695","text":"Isaac Donnithorne Walker (8 January 1844 – 6 July 1898) was an English cricketer.

Stars orbit moving galaxies, and they also orbit moving star clusters and companion stars. Planets orbit their moving stars. Stellar drift is measured by two components: proper motion (multiplied by distance) and radial velocity. Proper motion is a star's motion across the sky, slowly changing the shapes of constellations over thousands of years. It can be measured using a telescope to detect small movements over long periods of time. Radial velocity is how fast a star approaches or recedes from us. It is measured using redshift.

It now offers various basic and applied bio- medical science services. The Institute opened a museum on its premises in March 2014 to showcase Haffkine's research and developments in microbiology and chart the history of the institute. The Institute received ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2012. The Institute now serves as a teaching institution in the field of biomedical sciences and is affiliated to the University of Mumbai for M.Sc (Microbiology, Applied Biology and Organic Chemistry), Ph.D. (Microbiology) and M.D (P.S.M.) degree programs. In addition, the Institute undertakes specialized testing assignments and projects for pharmaceutical and other health-related products. The Institute conducts research in the improvement of the foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, surveillance and microbiological analysis of typhoid, prevalence of drug resistance in bacteria, studies of infections occurring in AIDS patients, and the development of newer chemotherapeutic agents to combat microbial and zoonotic infections.  History  Dr. Haffkine, an orthodox Jewish Ukrainian scientist assigned by the Pasteur Institute to work in India, is recognized as the microbiologist who first developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague. In October 1896, an epidemic of bubonic plague struck Bombay (now Mumbai) and the government asked Haffkine to help. He embarked upon the development of a vaccine in a makeshift laboratory in a corridor of Grant Medical College. In three months of persistent work (one of his assistants experienced a nervous breakdown, two others quit), a form of vaccine was ready for human trials. On 10 January 1897, Haffkine tested it on himself. The vaccines that Haffkine prepared had remarkable results. =Sans Pareil= Sans Pareil was once the official residence of the Governor of Bombay. This mansion, which was originally a Jesuit chapel, was built as part of the Jesuit monastery on Parel Island in 1673. William Hornby (1771–1784) was the first governor to take up residence at the mansion. The governor's residence moved to its present site on Malabar Hill in 1885 and the property was used by the Bombay Presidency Recorders. Haffkine moved into the building to set up the \\"Plague Research Laboratory\\" in 1899, the laboratory being formally opened by the then governor of Bombay, Lord Sandhurst.

They are generally regarded by scholars to be the original inhabitants of the Bahrain archipelago. Most Shi'i Bahraini citizens are ethnic Baharna. Regions with most of the population are in Eastern Arabia (Bahrain, Qatif, al-Hasa), with historical diaspora populations in Kuwait, (see Baharna in Kuwait), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Khuzestan Province in Iran, Iraq and United States. Some Bahrainis are from other parts of the world too. Origin The origin of Baharna is uncertain; there are different theories regarding their origins. Several Western scholars believe the Baharna originate from Bahrain's pre-Islamic population which consisted of partially-Christianized Arabs, Persian Zoroastrians, Jews (in Bahrain) and Aramaic-speaking agriculturalists. According to one historian, Arab settlements in Bahrain may have begun around 300 B.C. and control of the island was maintained by the Rabyah tribe, who converted to Islam in 630 A.D. There are many gaps and inconsistencies in the genealogies of those claiming descent from the Banu Abdul Qays in Bahrain, therefore Baharna are probably descendants of an ethnically-mixed population. Bahraini society has traditionally divided itself into three genealogical categories in order: ansab (clear genealogies), la ansab (unclear genealogies) and bani khudair (foreigner). Baharna were \\"la ansab\\" because they have uncertain ancestry. The Bahrani Arabic dialect exhibits Akkadian, Aramaic and Syriac features. The sedentary people of pre-Islamic Bahrain were Aramaic speakers and to some degree Persian speakers, while Syriac functioned as a liturgical language. The Bahrani dialect might have borrowed the Akkadian, Aramaic and Syriac features from Mesopotamian Arabic.Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary By Clive Holes. Page XXIX Since only little is known about their ancestry, Robert Hay referred to the Baharna as \\"Arabs without a pedigree\\". According to Robert Bertram Serjeant, the Baharna may be the Arabized \\"descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), Jews and ancient Persians (Majus) inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of Eastern Arabia at the time of the Arab conquest\\". Name The term Bahrani serves to distinguish the Bahrani people from other Shia in Bahrain, such as the ethnic Persian Bahrainis who fall under the term Ajam, as well as from the Sunni Najdi immigrants in Bahrain who are known as Al Arab (\\"Arabs\\").Lorimer, John Gordon, Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia, republished by Gregg International Publishers Limited Westemead.

Printed in Holland, 1970, Vol. II A, entries on \\"Bahrain\\" and \\"Baharna\\" In the United Arab Emirates, the Baharna make up 5% of Emiratis and are generally descended from Baharna tribesmen coming around 100–200 years ago. Etymology In Arabic, bahrayn is the dual form of bahr (\\"sea\\"), so al-Bahrayn means \\"the Two Seas\\". However, which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute. The term appears five times in the Qur'an, but does not refer to the modern islandoriginally known to the Arabs as \\"Awal\\"but rather to the oasis of Qatif and Hajar (modern al- Hasa).Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol. I. \\"Bahrayn\\", p. 941. E.J. Brill (Leiden), 1960. It is unclear when the term began to refer exclusively to Awal, but it was probably after the 15th century.

An alternate theory offered by al-Ahsa was that the two seas were the Persian Gulf and a peaceful lake on the mainland; still another provided by Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari is that the more formal name Bahri (lit. \\"belonging to the sea\\") would have been misunderstood and so was opted against.

Like most chlorocarbons, it is poorly soluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. 1,1-DCE was the precursor to the original cling-wrap, Saran, for food, but this application has been phased out. Production 1,1-DCE is produced by dehydrochlorination of 1,1,2-trichloroethane, a relatively unwanted byproduct in the production of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and 1,2-dichloroethane.

It was very popular, selling half a million copies, and was the initial source of Duras' fame. Plot The plot is initially the banal daily routine of a rich woman taking her son to piano lessons, and conversing with a working class man in a café, drinking wine all the way, then reaches a scandal at a dinner party in chapter 7, followed by a dénouement in the final chapter. The story concerns the life of a woman, Anne Desbaresdes, and her varying relationships with her child, the piano teacher Mademoiselle Giraud and Chauvin. Chauvin is a working-class man who is currently unemployed and whiles away his time in a café near the apartment where Anne Desbaresdes' child takes piano lessons with Madame Giraud. After the fatal shooting of a woman in the café by her lover, Anne and Chauvin imagine the relationship between the lovers and try to reason why it occurred. Anne frequently returns to the café, before returning to her comfortable home, the last house on the Boulevard de la Mer, which itself represents the social divide between the working- and middle-classes. In the climactic 7th chapter, she returns home late and drunk to a dinner party, then causes a scandal (and is subsequently ill, vomiting) whose consequences are seen in the 8th and final chapter. Organization The novella is organized into 8 chapters, 5 of which recount the passage of full days. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 recount a detailed 6th day of the novella, moving first from a piano lesson to Anne's meeting with Chauvin, and finally to the reception which Anne is late for. Thus, the novel recounts the passage of a full week during Anne's life. The novelette is ambiguous at many points throughout. In some instances, the reader cannot tell who is talking because no caption is provided for speeches. With the exception of Chauvin, Anne and Mademoiselle Giraud, no other names are mentioned; Anne's husband is referred to as \\"on\\" in French. The setting is also vague as we are never given a definitive place to locate the town, other than the fact that it is close to the sea. The time can be inferred to be late spring to early summer, but we cannot tell the exact month. However, specific settings, like Anne's house and the café, are described in detail in the description and speeches of the conversations between Anne and Chauvin. Chapter 1 and 5 are set in Mademoiselle Giraud's apartment. The other chapters all start with Anne's arrival at the café, her daily conversation with Chauvin, and her inevitable return to her home due to the siren that signals the end of the working day. It is speculated that Anne returns home at the siren in order to return before her husband gets home. Characters ;Anne Desbaresdes: The wife of a wealthy director of downtown factories, Anne belongs to the upper echelon of the town's social class. One day, while at her child's piano lesson, she sees and becomes intrigued by the murder of a woman by her possible lover. Subsequent chapters see Anne returning to the café where the murder was committed, often speculating upon details of the murder with Chauvin, a man who used to work in the factories her husband manages. Her venture into the café is considered a social faux- pas, as she comes into a shabby café where her husband's workers retire to daily; these workers recognize both Chauvin and Anne. While inventing details of the murder, Chauvin and Anne seem to have a metaphysical relationship reflected in their invented ideas; their relationship begins with talk about how the murdered couple's relationship began, and ends with Anne's acknowledgement that she is dead; reflective, again, of the murdered couple's relationship. Her life is characterized by repetition: many elements, such as her walk down the Boulevard of the Sea, the suppressed imagery of violence, the siren, seem to recur in succeeding chapters. One reading of the novelette interprets Anne's actions as an attempt to escape this repetition, ultimately culminating in the same repetition she was trying to avoid. She has an intense and profound attachment to her child, which may be interpreted as her inability to let go of maternal responsibilities. ;Chauvin: Chauvin is a working class man who used to work at Anne's husband's factory. His name seems to be an allusion to \\"chauvinism,\\" referring to his often dominating tone during conversations with Anne. However, in French, chauvin(e) is an adjective which translates as \\"patriotic.\\" The name Chauvin has nothing to do with \\"misogynie,\\" the French word for chauvinism. He remarks that he often has nothing to do. Throughout the novel, he has unusually detailed knowledge of Anne's house and habits. He knows her directly via the repetitious reception that Anne's husband gives for workers at his factory. He seems to have a (sexual) relationship with Anne that is achieved through words instead of physical contact. ;The Child: The child, (l'enfant), is never given a name, like many of the characters in the novelette. He is a talented piano player, but has little enthusiasm for learning the technicality of piano-playing: he doesn't make an effort to learn the meaning of tempo, nor does he find practicing scales necessary. The piece he plays throughout the novelette is the Diabelli sonata, the tempo of which composes the title: Moderato Cantabile (moderately and singingly). He is stubborn, and refuses to yield to the orders of his teacher, Madame Giraud. Critics have pointed to this stubbornness as a reflection of Anne's refusal to give in to the repetition of her life; this may be the reason why Anne approves of the child's obstinate behaviour. However, « Quand il obéit de cette façon, ça me dégoûte un peu. » (\\"When he obeys in this way, it disgusts me somewhat\\").Moderato Cantabile, p. 15 The child is at once her « honte » (shame) and « trésor ». 'Il est un enfant difficile {...} non sans une certaine timidité'. ('He's a difficult child {..} and not without a certain shyness').Moderato Cantabile, p. 9 ;Mademoiselle Giraud: Mademoiselle Giraud is the piano teacher of Anne's child. She disapproves of Anne's upbringing of the child, and is a stereotype of the strict teacher of the 20th century: at one point in the novelette she is portrayed with a ruler. ;Mr. Desbaresdes: Throughout the novelette Anne's husband is never really mentioned by reference or name, instead given the impersonal \\"on\\" in the French novel. Translated, this means \\"one\\" (i.e. One is, one has etc.) This suggests that he is never a real physical presence in Anne's life, although his presence looms over her. He is a wealthy factory- owner in the small town. The Desbaresdes' house is situated towards the end of a long Boulevard of the Sea, suggesting that it is the richest in town. ;The Boss: La patronne or the boss owns the café where the murder first occurs. She is a bystander of the metaphysical affair between Anne and Chauvin, and serves them wine from time to time. She usually serves clients who come from the factory at 6:00 pm from work. When she is not conversing with them, she is knitting a red sweater. This colour sustains the motif of the colour red throughout the novelette. Towards the latter stages of the relationship between Anne and Chauvin, she disapproves of their relationship, but says nothing. Relationships =Child and mother= Perhaps the most persistent and complex relationship throughout the novel revolves not around Chauvin and Anne, but around Anne and her child. The title is based on the tempo of a Diabelli sonatina, a child's piano piece. At various moments in the story, Anne remarks that the child has grown; the child is described as having the same blue eyes as Chauvin; the child wants a red motorboat, sustaining the image of red in the story; the child is with Anne throughout the story except when she enters the cafe and when she meditates at night. In addition, the only time the child is not present in the cafe is at the end of Anne's relationship with Chauvin - the last time Anne visits the cafe. Title The title is a musical direction, literally \\"moderately and singingly\\", and refers to a sonatina by Diabelli, presumably Sonatina in F major, op. 168, No. 1 (I: Moderato cantabile).See Diabelli : Sonatina Opus 168, No. 1 for sample and discussion of piece musically. Motifs A number of motifs in Moderato Cantabile occur throughout Duras's works to that point, which some critics argue provides needed context to understanding them, as they are largely ambiguous in the work itself. « Moderato Cantabile » dans l'œuvre de Margarite Duras, Gaëtan Picon, June 1958, Collection \\"double\\" pp. 153–165 ;Culminating images of violence: There are frequent images of violence throughout each chapter: in the first, the red colour of the sky culminates in a woman's scream, the cry, no doubt, of the murdered woman. In subsequent chapters this violence is replaced with the siren that signals the end of the work day for factory workers. Towards the end it is that of the devouring of food by guests at the reception Anne's husband throws, culminating in Anne's vomiting of the food she consumes. ;Magnolia: The first mention of the flower/tree comes in Chapter III, when the child is in the garden. Chauvin remarks that Anne was wearing a magnolia flower between her breasts during a reception, and that her breasts were semi-exposed. Anne also has a magnolia flower in her garden, right outside her window, which she remarks she closes because the smell of magnolia can become too strong at times. The flower/tree represents, no doubt, her sexuality; her closing of the windows signals her inability to handle the sexuality that she has suppressed within her. ;Wine: Anne drinks wine throughout the story, initially in order to stifle her trembling when she visits the café to go see Chauvin; the pace of wine drinking reflecting the dramatic arc of the work: building, climaxing in the 7th chapter, then diminishing again in the 8th chapter. She consumes progressively more wine during each meeting with Chauvin, at times \\"mechanically\\", and in Chapter 7, she drinks too much wine and winds up vomiting out the wine she had been drinking that day. In the final, 8th chapter, she then drinks the wine \\"in small mouthfuls\\" (« à petites gorgées»). The wine helps her to relax at the setting, and forget about the social burdens she holds. Symbolically, the act describes her casting off of these social burdens, and the image of alcohol as liberation recurs in Duras's works.Picon, pp. 159–160 Biographically, Duras was alcoholic at various periods of her life, giving added weight to this symbol. ;Motorboat: The motorboat (vedette) which passes in the open window in the opening scene and briefly recurs, is interpreted as a symbol of freedom, particularly in light of Duras's earlier use of a boat for this purpose in her preceding Le Marin de Gibraltar and Les petits chevaux de Tarquinia.Picon, Collection \\"double\\" p. 159 Style Moderato Cantabile is loosely identified as part of the nouveau roman movement started by Alain Robbe-Grillet, but critics take pains to distinguish Duras's style as distinct and inimitable. The book was published with the publishing house les Éditions de Minuit, which specialized in avant-garde works, unlike her previous works, which had been published by the more conventional Gallimard. Duras would not publish again with Minuit until Détruire, dit-elle of 1969, and thereafter continued to publish with Minuit. The style is initially austere: in the initial chapters, the action is described shallowly, at the surface, but changes sharply in Chapter 7, where the narrator is prominent and colors the description, sarcastically describing the \\"absurd\\" ritual of dinner and the \\"devouring\\" of the salmon and duck. The austere style is the focus of much commentary and of connection with the nouveau roman movement, while the rich seventh chapter is seen as a payoff by some critics, that may not be reached by readers who \\"shut the book before arriving [there]\\".Mauriac, Collection \\"double\\" p. 131 The novella is written in past tense, the French passé simple (usually translated as simple past) and \\"imparfait\\" (Imperfect). In Chapter 7, the tense changes noticeably from past to present during the dinner party, and from present to future simple during the last few paragraphs of the chapter. The format of the bulk of the novel, of a meeting between two people, is particularly prefigured by Le Square (\\"The Square\\"), Duras' immediately preceding novel, which features two strangers meeting and talking on a park bench one Saturday afternoon, a fact commented on by many critics, but also is a focus of several, arguably all, of her previous works.Picon, Collection \\"double\\" p. 160 Reception Moderato Cantabile was very popular, selling half a million copies. Critical response was sharply divided, but generally very positive. A survey of contemporary French critical response is given in the critical edition (Collection \\"double\\"), in the section \\"Moderato Cantabile et la presse française\\". It was the first winner of the short-lived Prix de Mai. Critics praised the innovative, austere, \\"formal\\", allusive style, a work of suggestive words and gestures. Conversely, the work is criticized as lacking plot,Robert Poulet, La règle du jeu transgressée, pp. 140–143 as being more an essay than a work of art,Jean Mistler, Un essai non un œuvre achevée, Collection \\"double\\", pp. 148–150 and of lacking context for its images – the symbolism only being apparent in the context of Duras's oeuvre. Erin Shevaugn Schlumpf suggests that the novel manifests \\"a feminine melancholy\\". Film adaptation The novel was filmed in 1960 by Peter Brook, and starring Jean- Paul Belmondo and Jeanne Moreau. The latter won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance. Editions * Collection \\"double\\", *:Critical edition.

Jacques de Billy de Prunay, Sonnets spirituels (1567). Jacques de Billy (Billi) de Prunay was a French patristic scholar, theologian, jurist, linguist, and Benedictine abbot (1535—December 25, 1581). Born in Guise in Picardy, he began his studies at Paris, completed a course of philosophy and theology before he was eighteen years of age, and then, at the request of his parents went to Orléans and later to Poitiers to study jurisprudence. But having no inclination for law, he devoted most of his time to literature. The early death of his parents gave him the opportunity he desired of pursuing unhampered his favorite study of letters. Quietly withdrawing to Lyon and later to Avignon, de Billy devoted himself, for a period, entirely to the study of Greek and Hebrew. He already held in commendam the Abbey of St.-Léonard of Ferrières in Anjou, and the Priory of Taussigny in Touraine, when his older brother Jean, who had hitherto led a very worldly life, suddenly announced his intention of becoming a Carthusian, and resigned in favour of Jacques his two abbeys, Notre-Dame des Châtelliers and Saint-Michel-en-l'Herm. After some hesitation de Billy accepted them, then entered the Order of St. Benedict, and later was made a regular abbot. Thenceforth he led a very ascetic life and governed his monasteries with great prudence. He was especially solicitous for the proper observance of monastic discipline and with that object in view renewed, in 1566, the statutes of his predecessor, Abbot Bertrand de Moussy. During the civil wars that devastated France at this period the monastery of St.-Michel-en-l'Herme was wholly destroyed. The abbot himself was frequently obliged to seek refuge from the ravages of war, and resided, for short periods, at Laon, Nantes, Paris, and in the Priory of Taussigny. His Anthologia sacra libri quator, quorum primus & secundus a Jacobo Billio...Tertius Prosperi Aquitanici sacra Epigrammata in D. Aurelii Augustini sententias continet..

A planar ternary ring (PTR) or ternary field is special type of ternary system used by to construct projective planes by means of coordinates. A planar ternary ring is not a ring in the traditional sense, but any field gives a planar ternary ring where the operation T is defined by T(a,b,c) = ab + c. Thus, we can think of a planar ternary ring as a generalization of a field where the ternary operation takes the place of both addition and multiplication. In effect, in computer architecture, this ternary operation is known, e.g., as the multiply–accumulate operation (MAC). There is wide variation in the terminology. Planar ternary rings or ternary fields as defined here have been called by other names in the literature, and the term \\"planar ternary ring\\" can mean a variant of the system defined here. The term \\"ternary ring\\" often means a planar ternary ring, but it can also simply mean a ternary system. Definition A planar ternary ring is a structure (R,T) where R is a set containing at least two distinct elements, called 0 and 1, and T\\\\colon R^3\\\\to R \\\\, is a mapping which satisfies these five axioms: # T(a,0,b)=T(0,a,b)=b,\\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in R; # T(1,a,0)=T(a,1,0)=a,\\\\quad \\\\forall a \\\\in R; # \\\\forall a,b,c,d \\\\in R, a eq c, there is a unique x\\\\in R such that : T(x,a,b)=T(x,c,d) \\\\,; # \\\\forall a,b,c \\\\in R, there is a unique x \\\\in R, such that T(a,b,x)=c \\\\,; and # \\\\forall a,b,c,d \\\\in R, a eq c, the equations T(a,x,y)=b,T(c,x,y)=d \\\\, have a unique solution (x,y)\\\\in R^2. When R is finite, the third and fifth axioms are equivalent in the presence of the fourth. No other pair (0', 1') in R^2 can be found such that T still satisfies the first two axioms. Binary operations =Addition= Define a\\\\oplus b=T(a,1,b).In the literature there are two versions of this definition. This is the form used by , , and , while a \\\\oplus b = T(1,a,b) is used by , , and . The difference comes from the alternative ways these authors coordinatize the plane. The structure (R,\\\\oplus) is a loop with identity element 0. =Multiplication= Define a\\\\otimes b=T(a,b,0). The set R_{0} = R \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\, is closed under this multiplication. The structure (R_{0},\\\\otimes) is also a loop, with identity element 1. =Linear PTR= A planar ternary ring (R,T) is said to be linear if T(a,b,c)=(a\\\\otimes b)\\\\oplus c,\\\\quad \\\\forall a,b,c \\\\in R. For example, the planar ternary ring associated to a quasifield is (by construction) linear. Connection with projective planes Coordinates of a projective plane to establish a planar ternary ring Given a planar ternary ring (R,T), one can construct a projective plane with point set P and line set L as follows:R. H. Bruck, Recent Advances in the Foundations of Euclidean Plane Geometry, The American Mathematical Monthly, vol. 66, pp. 2-17 (1955) Appendix I. (Note that \\\\infty is an extra symbol not in R.) Let * P=\\\\\\\\{(a,b)|a,b\\\\in R\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{(a)|a \\\\in R \\\\\\\\}\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{(\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\}, and * L=\\\\\\\\{[a,b]|a,b \\\\in R\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{[a]|a \\\\in R \\\\\\\\}\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{[\\\\infty]\\\\\\\\}. Then define, \\\\forall a,b,c,d \\\\in R, the incidence relation I in this way: :((a,b),[c,d])\\\\in I \\\\Longleftrightarrow T(a,c,d)=b :((a,b),[c])\\\\in I \\\\Longleftrightarrow a=c : ((a,b),[\\\\infty]) otin I :((a), [c,d])\\\\in I \\\\Longleftrightarrow a=c :((a), [c]) otin I :((a),[\\\\infty])\\\\in I :((\\\\infty),[c,d]) otin I :((\\\\infty),[a])\\\\in I :((\\\\infty),[\\\\infty])\\\\in I Every projective plane can be constructed in this way, starting with an appropriate planar ternary ring. However, two nonisomorphic planar ternary rings can lead to the construction of isomorphic projective planes. Conversely, given any projective plane π, by choosing four points, labelled o, e, u, and v, no three of which lie on the same line, coordinates can be introduced in π so that these special points are given the coordinates: o = (0,0), e = (1,1), v = (\\\\infty) and u = (0).This can be done in several ways. A short description of the method used by can be found in . The ternary operation is now defined on the coordinate symbols (except \\\\infty) by y = T(x,a,b) if and only if the point (x,y) lies on the line which joins (a) with (0,b). The axioms defining a projective plane are used to show that this gives a planar ternary ring. Linearity of the PTR is equivalent to a geometric condition holding in the associated projective plane. Related algebraic structures PTR's which satisfy additional algebraic conditions are given other names. These names are not uniformly applied in the literature. The following listing of names and properties is taken from . A linear PTR whose additive loop is associative (and thus a group ), is called a cartesian group. In a cartesian group, the mappings x \\\\longrightarrow -x \\\\otimes a + x \\\\otimes b , and x \\\\longrightarrow a \\\\otimes x - b \\\\otimes x must be permutations whenever a eq b. Since cartesian groups are groups under addition, we revert to using a simple \\"+\\" for the additive operation. A quasifield is a cartesian group satisfying the right distributive law: (x+y) \\\\otimes z = x \\\\otimes z + y \\\\otimes z . Addition in any quasifield is commutative. A semifield is a quasifield which also satisfies the left distributive law: x \\\\otimes (y + z) = x \\\\otimes y + x \\\\otimes z. A planar nearfield is a quasifield whose multiplicative loop is associative (and hence a group). Not all nearfields are planar nearfields.

The doctor may ask the patient to \\"bear down\\" or push as if he/she were going to have a bowel movement, and then relax. This helps the doctor insert the anoscope more easily and identify any bulges along the lining of the rectum. By shining a light into this tube, the doctor will have a clear view of the lining of the lower rectum and anus. The anoscope is pulled out slowly once the test is finished.

In the specific case of social networks, assortative mixing is also known as homophily. The rarer disassortative mixing is a bias in favor of connections between dissimilar nodes. In social networks, for example, individuals commonly choose to associate with others of similar age, nationality, location, race, income, educational level, religion, or language as themselves. In networks of sexual contact, the same biases are observed, but mixing is also disassortative by gender - most partnerships are between individuals of opposite sex. Assortative mixing can have effects, for example, on the spread of disease: if individuals have contact primarily with other members of the same population groups, then diseases will spread primarily within those groups. Many diseases are indeed known to have differing prevalence in different population groups, although other social and behavioral factors affect disease prevalence as well, including variations in quality of health care and differing social norms. Assortative mixing is also observed in other (non-social) types of networks, including biochemical networks in the cell, computer and information networks, and others. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of assortative mixing by degree, meaning the tendency of nodes with high degree to connect to others with high degree, and similarly for low degree. Because degree is itself a topological property of networks, this type of assortative mixing gives rise to more complex structural effects than other types. Empirically it has been observed that most social networks mix assortatively by degree, but most networks of other types mix disassortatively, although there are exceptions.

The Institutes also provides extensive early-learning programs for \\"well\\" children, including programs focused on reading, mathematics, language, and physical fitness. It is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with offices and programs offered in several other countries. Pattern therapy for patients with neuromuscular disorders was first developed by neurosurgeon Temple Fay in the 1940s. Patterning has been widely criticized and multiple studies have found the therapy ineffective. History The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP, also known as \\"The Institutes\\") was founded in 1955. It practices pattern therapy, which was developed by Doman and educational psychologist Carl Delacato. Pattern therapy drew upon the ideas and work of ideas of neurophysiologist Temple Fay, former head of the Department of Neurosurgery at Temple University School of Medicine and president of the Philadelphia Neurological Society. In 1960, Doman and Delacato published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) detailing pattern therapy. The methodology of their study was later criticized. Philosophy The philosophy of the Institutes consists of several interrelated beliefs: that every child has genius potential, stimulation is the key to unlocking a child's potential, teaching should commence at birth, the younger the child, the easier the learning process, children naturally love to learn, parents are their child's best teacher, teaching and learning should be joyous and teaching and learning should never involve testing. This philosophy follows very closely to the Japanese Suzuki method for violin, which is also taught at the institute in addition to the Japanese language itself. The Institutes consider brain damage, intellectual impairment, \\"mental deficiency\\", cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, athetosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, \\"developmental delay\\", and Down syndrome as conditions encompassing \\"brain injury\\", the term favored by IAHP. Much of the work at The Institutes follows from Dr. Temple Fay who believed in recapitulation theory, which posits that the infant brain evolves through chronological stages of development similar to first a fish, a reptile, a mammal and finally a human. This theory can be encapsulated as \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\". Recapitulation theory has been largely discredited in biology. According to a 2007 WPVI television news report, IAHP uses the word \\"hurt\\" to describe the children they see \\"with all kinds of brain injuries and conditions, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, epilepsy, Down's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism\\". Glenn Doman described his own personal philosophy for treating patients as stemming from his WWII veteran officer motto: \\"Leave no injured behind.\\" Programs =Programs for brain-injured children= IAHP’s program begins with a five-day seminar for the parents of \\"brain injured\\" children, because the program is carried out by parents at their homes. Following the seminar, IAHP conducts an initial evaluation of the child. The program described in the 1960 JAMA paper (Doman, et al.) for \\"brain-injured\\" children included: * Patterning – manipulation of limbs and head in a rhythmic fashion * Crawling – forward bodily movement with the abdomen in contact with the floor * Creeping – forward bodily movement with the abdomen raised from the floor * Receptive stimulation – visual, tactile and auditory stimulation * Expressive activities – e.g. picking up objects * Masking – breathing into a rebreathing mask to increase the amount of carbon dioxide inhaled, which is purported to increase cerebral blood flow * Brachiation – swinging from a bar or vertical ladder * Gravity/Antigravity activities – rolling, somersaulting and hanging upside down. The IAHP holds that brain injury at a given level of neurological development prevents or slows further progress. Other therapies utilized by IAHP include eye exercises for children who have an eye that converges more than the other when looking at an object in the distance and those who have one eye that diverges more than the other when an object is moved slowly toward the bridge of the nose. IAHP also recommends stimulating the eyes of children with amblyopia by flashing a light on and off. For children with poor hearing, IAHP recommends auditory stimulation with loud noises, which may be pre-recorded. Brain-injured children may also be taught to identify by touch alone various objects placed in a bag. IAHP recommends dietary restrictions, including reduced fluid intake for brain-injured children in an attempt to prevent \\"the possible overaccumulation of cerebrospinal fluid\\". Alongside fluid restriction, IAHP recommends a diet low in salt, sweets, and other \\"thirst provoking\\" foods. Scientific evaluation and criticism The Institutes model of childhood development has been criticized in the scientific community. =American Academy of Pediatrics position statement= According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, patterning treatment is based on an oversimplified theory of brain development and its effectiveness is not supported by evidence-based medicine, making its use unwarranted. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Children With Disabilities issued warnings regarding patterning, one of the IAHP's therapies for brain injured children, as early as 1968 and repeated in 1982. Their latest cautionary policy statement was in 1999, which was reaffirmed in 2010 states: > This treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of brain > development. Current information does not support the claims of proponents > that this treatment is efficacious, and its use continues to be > unwarranted.... [T]he demands and expectations placed on families are so > great that in some cases their financial resources may be depleted > substantially and parental and sibling relationships could be stressed. =Others= In addition to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a number of other organizations have issued cautionary statements about claims for efficacy of this therapy. These include the executive committee of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy, the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Texas, the Canadian Association for Retarded Children the executive board of the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Hornby et al. call R.A. Cummins 1988 book The Neurologically Impaired-child: Doman-Delacato Techniques Reappraised (Croom Helm, ), \\"The most comprehensive analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of the Doman-Delacato programme to date\\" and state Cummins uses neuroanatomy and neurophysiology to demonstrate that there is no sound scientific basis for the techniques used by the IAHP and concludes any benefit is likely due to increased activity and attention. Hornby et al. conclude, \\"It is now clear that the only results supporting the effectiveness of the programme come from a handful of early, poorly controlled studies.\\" Kavale and Mostert and others also identified serious problems with the early research on the IAHP program. An analysis of higher quality studies found that students not receiving the treatment had better outcomes than those who were treated by the IAHP. A 15 patient 2012 Norwegian cost analysis of an unproven intensive training treatment for brain damage that included 11 patients treated by IAHP found the treatment regimen not cost effective. The authors expressed doubt that the treatments could achieve adequate benefits to be cost effective and concluded that health care services should only fund these treatments for clinical trials. A 2013 study found the claims of superior results of treatment by the IAHP were not substantiated. A 2006 retrospective study of 21 children by the IAHP and others of children with cortical visual impairment found significant improvement after use of the program the study had no control group. Norum et al. stated regarding this study, \\"...any proof of effectiveness cannot be obtained from a non-randomized study\\". Doctors Martha Farrell Erickson and Karen Marie Kurz-Riemer wrote that IAHP \\"capitalized on the desires of members of the 'baby boom' generation to maximize their children's intellectual potential\\" and \\"encouraged parents to push their infants to develop maximum brain power\\". But most contemporary child development experts \\"described many aspects of the program as useless and perhaps even harmful\\". Kathleen Quill concluded that \\"professionals\\" have nothing to learn from pattern therapy. Pavone and Ruggieri have written that pattern therapy does not have an important role in treatment. Neurologist Steven Novella has characterized pattern therapy as being based on a discarded theory and a \\"false cure\\". He also wrote that IAHP's unsubstantiated claims can cause both financial and emotional damage. While detailing criticism of pattern therapy, Robards also wrote that the therapy caused pediatricians and therapists to recognize that early intervention programs are necessary. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations have criticized the IAHP's claims of effectiveness, theoretical basis and the demands placed on parents by IAHP programs. Early studies originating from IAHP appeared to show some value of their program but were later criticized as significantly flawed. Kenneth Kavale and Mark Mostert have written that later studies they believe to have better design and more objectivity have shown pattern therapy \\"to be practically without merit\\". In their book Controversial Issues in Special Education, Garry Hornby, Jean Howard and Mary Atkinson state the program also includes \\"gagging\\" in which the child breathes into a plastic bag until gasping for breath. This is based on the belief that it will cause maximum use of the lungs and thus maximize oxygen circulation to the brain. The book concludes that pattern therapy is ineffective and potentially damaging to the functioning of families. =Attitude to scientific evaluation= In the 1960s, IAHP published that appeared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the program. However, they subsequently instructed parents of children in their program not to take part in any independent studies designed to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The IAHP withdrew its agreement to participate in a \\"carefully designed study supported by federal and private agencies\\" when the study was in its final planning stages.

It is most likely based on the ship Polynia, built in 1861, of the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company fleet. Polynia was commanded by Captain William Guy from 1883 to 1891, when she was sunk by ice in Davis Strait. This song is similar to another song called The Balaena, about another whaler. Background story Every year, the whaling fleet would sail from Dundee, Scotland to Newfoundland, there to pick up men to hunt the whales. Since the first ships to make it to Newfoundland would be able to pick the most experienced men, it became a bit of a competition to see who could make it in the fastest time. The other ships named in the song, Arctic, Aurora, Terra Nova, and Husky, are all ships from the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company fleet. Aurora was the ship that rescued the crew of Polynia in 1891 when she sunk. Art Jackman, Mullins, and Fairweather were captains of the ships at that time. There are records of a Captain Fairweather in command of Balaena (mentioned in 1894 and 1896), an Alex Fairweather in command of Terra Nova (1885-1893), and a J. Fairweather for Aurora (1882-1886). This song has been published in a number of song books, including the 1955 edition of Gerald S. Doyle's Old-Time Songs and Poetry of Newfoundland, as well as Paul Mercer's Newfoundland Songs and Ballads in Print 1842-1974 and Michael Taft's A Regional Discography of Newfoundland and Labrador 1904-1972. Recordings There are a number of recordings of this song available, including: *Trade Winds, recorded by Omar Blondahl *Another Time - The Songs of Newfoundland, recorded by Fergus O'Byrne (of Ryan's Fancy fame) (1991) *Newfoundland, recorded by Mark Hiscock on an album with Chris Andrews (both of Shanneyganock fame) *The Hard and the Easy, by Great Big Sea (2005) *Winners and Boozers,recorded by Fiddler’s Green (2013) Lyrics :There’s a noble fleet of whalers a-sailing from Dundee, :Manned by British sailors to take them o’er the sea. :On a western ocean passage we started on the trip. :We flew along just like a song in our gallant whaling ship. :‘Twas the second Sunday morning, just after leaving port, :We met a heavy Sou’west gale that washed away our boat. :It washed away our quarterdeck, our stanchions just as well, :And so we sent the whole shebang a-floating in the gale. :CHORUS : :For the wind was on her quarter and the engine’s working free. :There’s not another whaler that sails the Arctic Sea :Can beat the Old Polina, you need not try, my sons, :For we challenged all both great and small from Dundee to St. John’s. :Art Jackman set his canvas, Fairweather got up steam, :But Captain Guy, the daring boy, came plunging through the stream. :And Mullins in the Husky tried to beat the blooming lot, :But to beat the Old Polina was something he could not. :CHORUS :There’s the noble Terra Nova, a model without doubt. :The Arctic and Aurora they talk so much about. :Art Jackman’s model mailboat, the terror of the sea, :Tried to beat the Old Polina on a passage from Dundee. :CHORUS :And now we’re back in old St. John’s where rum is very cheap. :So we’ll drink a health to Captain Guy who brought us o’er the deep. :A health to all our sweethearts and to our wives so fair. :Not another ship could make the trip but the Polina I declare. The Other Ships The Aurora was built in 1876, and was a whaling ship until 1910, when it was bought by Douglas Mawson for a scientific expedition to Antarctica from 1911 to 1914. It disappeared, with all hands, in 1918. The whaling ship Terra Nova was built in 1884, but was used for Antarctic exploration between 1894 and 1913. She returned to the Newfoundland seal fishery from 1913, until 1943, when she sank off the coast of Greenland. The crew was rescued by a US Coastguard ship.

It is actually closer to the Egyptian town of Siwa than to any Libyan town of note. And like Siwa, its population is Berber. The oasis is located in Butnan District and is the administrative seat of the Jaghbub Basic People's Congress. Supported by reservoirs of underground water and date production, the town is best known for its hard-won self-sufficiency. Idris of Libya was born in Jaghbub on 12 March 1890. Geography The Jaghbub oasis is located in a deep depression that extends below sea level. This depression, an area lower than the surrounding region, reaches to about -10 m. Elevation data by NASA's SRTM To the east the Siwa Oasis lies in a similar depression and even further east the large Qattara Depression also lies below sea level. History It was once the headquarters of the Senussi Movement and home of a long disappeared Islamic university and the former Senussi palace (which is now in rubble). Jaghbub was a part of Egypt until December 1925, when it was ceded to Italy as part of a deal to fix the Egypt–Libya border. In February 1931, the Italian colonial administration led by Marshal Rodolfo Graziani decided to build a barbed-wire fence stretching from the Mediterranean port of Bardia to Jaghbub 270 km away. Supervised by armoured patrols and the air force, the fence sought to cut off the rebels from their supply sources and contacts with the Senussi leadership in Egypt. The construction of the fence began in April, 1931 and was completed in September. This, along with the deportation of almost the entire population of the Jebel Akhdar, was decisive and precipitated the end of the rebellion. The fence still runs along the Libyan-Egyptian border from near Tobruk, finishing at Jaghbub where the Great Sand Sea begins. The construction of the fence was dramatized in the film Lion of the Desert. The Siege of Giarabub was fought between Commonwealth and Italian forces during World War II. Italian and Libyan colonial troops led by Colonel Salvatore Castagna resisted a siege by mostly Australian troops for three months before being forced to surrender on 23 March 1941. The resistance of the Italian troops was celebrated by the fascist regime and used to minimize the military defeat in Cyrenaica.

When exercising a call option, the owner of the option purchases the underlying shares (or commodities, fixed interest securities, etc.) at the strike price from the option seller, while for a put option, the owner of the option sells the underlying to the option seller, again at the strike price.  Styles  The option style, as specified in the contract, determines when, how, and under what circumstances, the option holder may exercise it. It is at the discretion of the owner whether (and in some circumstances when) to exercise it. * European – European-style option contracts may only be exercised at the option's expiration date. Thus they can never be worth more than an American-style option with the same underlying strike price and expiration date. * American – American-style option contracts can be exercised at any time up to the option's expiration. Under certain circumstances (see below) early exercise may be advantageous to the option holder. * Bermudan – Bermudan-style options contracts may only be exercised on specified dates. Bermudan-style options are common in the interest rate options and swaps markets.  Settlement  The option contract specifies the manner in which the contract is to be settled. * Physical settlement – Physically settled options require the actual delivery of the underlying security. An example of a physically settled contract is U.S.-listed exchange-traded equity options. Delivery settles in two business days. It is the most common form of settlement. Physically settled options are mostly American style. * Cash settlement – Cash-settled options do not require the actual delivery of the underlier. Instead, the market value, at the exercise date, of the underlier is compared to the strike price, and the difference (if in a favourable direction) is paid by the option seller to the owner of the option. An example of a cash-settled contract is most U.S.-listed exchange-traded index options. This settlement occurs the next business day following the trade.  Considerations  The following guidelines determine whether and when to exercise an option: # An option should only be exercised if it is in the money by at least as much as the fees associated with the underlying transaction (e.g. the fee for subsequently selling an underlying which has been physically delivered). The exercise usually costs money as well. # In most cases, options should not be exercised before expiration because doing so gives away inherent value. Selling them would almost invariably yield more. # For an American- style call option, early exercise is a possibility whenever the benefits of being long the underlier outweigh the cost of surrendering the option early. For instance, on the day before an ex-dividend date, it may make sense to exercise an equity call option early in order to collect the dividend. In general, equity call options should only be exercised early on the day before an ex-dividend date, and then only for deep in-the-money options. # For an American-style put option, early exercise is a possibility for deep in-the- money options. In this case, it may make sense to exercise the option early in order to obtain the intrinsic value (K-S) earlier so that it can start to earn interest immediately. This is somewhat more likely to be worthwhile if there is no ex-dividend date (which would probably cause the price of the underlying to fall further) between now and the expiry date. = Early exercise strategy = A common strategy among professional option traders is to sell large quantities of in-the-money calls just prior to an ex-dividend date. Quite often, non-professional option traders may not understand the benefit of exercising a call option early, and therefore may unintentionally forgo the value of the dividend. The professional trader may only be 'assigned' on a portion of the calls, and therefore profits by receiving a dividend on the stock used to hedge the calls that are not exercised.  Assignment and clearing  Assignment occurs when an option holder exercises his option by notifying his broker, who then notifies the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The OCC fulfills the contract, then selects, randomly, a member firm who was short the same option contract. The OCC then notifies the firm. The firm then carries out its obligation, and then selects a customer, either randomly, first-in, first-out, or some other equitable method who was short the option, for assignment. That customer is assigned the exercise requiring him to fulfill the obligation that he agreed to when he wrote the option.  Exercise by exception  In the U.S., for the convenience of brokers, who would otherwise have to request exercise of all in the money options, the Options Clearing Corporation will automatically exercise any option that is set to expire in the money by 1 cent or more. This is called \\"exercise by exception\\". A broker or holder of such options may request that they not be exercised by exception. The price of the underlying security used to determine the need for exercise by exception is the price of the regular-hours trade reported last to the OCC at or before 4:01:30 pm ET on the day before expiration. This trade will have occurred during normal trading hours, i.e., before 4:00 pm. It can be any size and come from any participating exchange. The OCC reports this price tentatively at 4:15 pm, but, to allow time for exchanges to correct errors the OCC does not make the price official until 5:30 pm. \\"OCC Infomemo #30048: Underlying Prices for Expiration\\" Accessed Jan 21, 2012 References Options (finance) ","title":"Exercise (options)"},{"id":"4027967","text":"Terauchi (written: 寺内) is a Japanese surname.

He held the office of Chairman of County Londonderry sessions, which he resigned to seek election to Parliament. He was MP for Bandon in 1835–1841.

Instead of seeking re-election in Bandon, Jackson stood for Dublin University. He represented that seat between 11 February 1842 and 9 September 1842. He was then appointed a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) 1842–1848. He resigned his Parliamentary seat by accepting the Chiltern Hundreds, so he could take up the judicial post. Jackson was described as a \\"temperate\\" politician, but he was a reliable supporter of the Protestant monarchy, constitution and church as well as the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, and a staunch opponent of Daniel O'Connell.

The school has over 20,000 alumni. The school's Paris campuses, located in the 7th and 15th arrondissement, are home to 2,400 students of 80 different nationalities. Its Lille campus, located in the town of Marcq-en-Baroeul, has more than 1000 students including 120 boarders. The Paris school was ranked the best high school in France for the seventh consecutive year in 2019, while the Lille school came in third place nationwide for 2019. The parisian school is ranked No.1 of the best high schools in France for the eighth consecutive year for 2020. École Jeannine Manuel's London school opened its doors in 2015 in the heart of Bloomsbury. It currently has 500 students from Nursery to Year 12 (Year 13 in 2021). Like its French counterpart, the London school offers a bilingual curriculum and its students sit the French and International Baccalaureate exams.  History  = Jeannine Manuel = Jeannine Manuel joined the French Resistance and became a member of the Free French in London in 1940. She returned to France in August 1944. In 1954, Jeannine Manuel founded the Ecole Active Bilingue in a former townhouse on Avenue de La Bourdonnais in Paris. For Jeannine Manuel, the aim of education was to help shape “whole” people, by which she meant, “individuals aware of their presence in this world, engaged in its history, and ready to play a part in world affairs”. = Expansion = The school opened its doors in September 1954 with 9 students enrolled, a number that grew to 100 by January 1955. The school continued growing at such a rate that, by 1960, there was a lack of available space to accommodate its growing student body. Jeannine Manuel consequently created special bilingual classes for her secondary students and teachers at the Lycée de Sèvres in collaboration with her friend, Edmée Hatinguais, who was Inspector General, former head of the École Normale Supérieure de jeunes filles de Sèvres, and the first director of the International Center for Pedagogical Studies (Centre international d’études pédagogiques). The bilingual curriculum and pedagogical approach offered at the Lycée de Sèvres closely mirrored that developed by Jeannine Manuel. A few years later, Jeannine Manuel opened a new school near Parc Monceau with the help of a new investor. However, in 1979, a conflict between a need for return on investment and Jeannine Manuel's pedagogical principles led to an official split between the two schools. Jeannine Manuel consequently left the school on the Parisian right bank but kept the two small schools on Avenue de la Bourdonnais and Avenue de Suffren. Jeannine Manuel opened another school on 70 Rue du Théâtre in the 15th arrondissement of Paris In 1999, at Jeannine Manuel's behest, her eldest son Bernard Manuel regrouped the recently opened school in Marcq-en- Baroeul (Lille) and the new Dupleix site in Paris into a single non-profit association together with the other pre-existing schools. Bernard Manuel remains president of the association. = Creation of the Fondation Jeannine Manuel = In 2004, one year after Jeannine Manuel's death, the Fondation Jeannine Manuel was established under the patronage of the Fondation de France. The Fondation's mission is to support École Jeannine Manuel and to encourage the development of other schools with a similar mission and pedagogical approach. They host a gala every year. = School renamed in honor of Jeannine Manuel = In 2014, on the occasion of its sixtieth birthday, the school was officially renamed École Jeannine Manuel. = École Jeannine Manuel opens its doors in London = In 2015, with the financial support of the Foundation and in honor of Jeannine Manuel's formative years in London, the school opened its first site in Bedford Square, London. The Russell Square premises for the Upper School opened in 2019.  Administrative structure  = 1901 association & American International section = The school is a 1901 non-profit association and is under contract with the French state since 1959. Both the Paris and Lille schools are official international sections. Students consequently have the opportunity of sitting the international (US) option of the French Baccalaureate (the OIB), a demanding bilingual and bicultural exam taken by only 1% of students sitting the Baccalaureate. In 2010, Elisabeth Zéboulon, Director of École Jeannine Manuel, and Sean Lynch, Head of the American Section at the Lycée International of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, founded the Association of American International Sections (AAMIS) to help develop the OIB exam in schools. With Bernard Manuel as its president since 2012, AAMIS now includes more than 40 member high-schools that offer the OIB in Shanghai, San Francisco, Beirut, Johannesburg and other cities across the world. = IB World School with CIS and NEASC accreditations = With regards to international accreditations, École Jeannine Manuel was one of the first associated UNESCO schools and one of the first International Baccalaureate (IB) World Schools. The school is also accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

He was the youngest general officer in the Canadian Army when promoted to Brigadier on August 17, 1944, at the age of 27. Early life Born in Montreal, Quebec, he was educated at Selwyn House School, Bishop's College School and McGill University. He served as an officer with the Victoria Rifles of Canada. World War II When World War II broke out, Moncel went to Europe with the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR). In May 1940, he was ordered along with the RCR to France to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force facing the German blitzkrieg. Soon however, Lieutenant Moncel, who commanded a Bren gun carrier platoon, was ordered to retreat to the French coast. When being evacuated, he was ordered to destroy his equipment to save it from German hands, but Moncel, with his cool judgement, managed to evacuate the Bren gun carriers. This act caught the eyes of his superiors and he was promoted to captain. In 1941, he finished first on a staff course under the command of Guy Simonds, and was promoted to major in 1942, and lieutenant-colonel in January 1943. Moncel became the commanding officer of 18th Armoured Car Regiment (12th Manitoba Dragoons).Robert Moncel Generals.dk Later, Moncel was posted as the General Staff Officer 1 of the II Canadian Corps, where he reorganized its general staff.

Before Ellington Procope was born in New York City and grew up in San Juan Hill, where he went to school with Benny Carter. His first instrument was the violin, but he switched to clarinet and alto saxophone. He began his professional career in 1926 as a member of Billy Freeman's orchestra. At the age of 20 he recorded with Jelly Roll Morton and went on to play with bands led by Benny Carter, Chick Webb (1929–30), Fletcher Henderson (spring of 1931 to 1934), Tiny Bradshaw, Teddy Hill, King Oliver, and Willie Bryant. Fletcher Henderson's band dissolved in 1934. Along with several other ex-Henderson musicians, Procope went into Benny Carter's orchestra. He also worked for a time with the Tiny Bradshaw and Willie Bryant bands before joining Teddy Hill in 1935. During his stay with Teddy Hill's orchestra the trumpet section included, at various times, Roy Eldridge, Bill Coleman, Frank Newton, and Dizzy Gillespie, while trombonist Dickie Wells and tenor- saxophonist Chu Berry were two other distinguished soloists who played with the band. It was as a member of this orchestra that Russell Procope made his first trip to Europe in 1937; Teddy Hill's band formed part of \\"The Cotton Club Revue,\\" an all-coloured show, which during its European tour appeared at the London Palladium. In 1938 Procope replaced Pete Brown in John Kirby's sextet, with whom he played exclusively alto sax until 1945 (with an interruption for World War II). It was with Kirby that he began to make his name. Kirby's band included Charlie Shavers (trumpet), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Procope (alto-sax), Billy Kyle (piano) and O'Neill Spencer (drums). This group was billed as \\"The Biggest Little Band In The World\\" - performing intricate, tightly-woven small-band orchestrations, combining precision with relaxation and a high standard of solo playing. In some way John Kirby's music contributed elements to the experiments which were to be pursued by jazz modernists during the middle Forties. From 1942 until the end of World War II, Procope served in the U.S. armed forces. Ellington and afterwards Procope joined the Ellington orchestra in 1946, standing in for Otto Hardwick for one night in Worcester, Massachusetts, and staying until Ellington's death in 1974. Procope came to Europe again as a member of this band during the summer of 1950. Like all members of the Ellington reed section except for alto saxophone titan Johnny Hodges and marathon tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, Procope doubled on the clarinet, and it was on that instrument that he made his reputation. Though he was a fine saxophonist who could (and did) play tenor as well as alto saxophone with authority, Procope was most highly regarded for his woody, understated clarinet solos, a warm contrast to fellow reed section member Jimmy Hamilton's cheerful, breezy style. (An excellent, immediate hearing of the contrast between the two clarinetists can be heard on Ellington's three-part suite \\"Idiom '59\\"; Ellington handed Procope the solo for the slower tempoed opening part, before handing Hamilton the first clarinet solo and the bridge blues solo on the more swinging second part.) Procope was also highly regarded personally within and outside the Ellington band. \\"He was\\", wrote Ellington in Music is My Mistress, \\"an utterly sober and reliable musician, always to be depended upon.\\" After Ellington's death, Procope toured with Brooks Kerr's trio. In 1956, Procope recorded The Persuasive Sax of Russ Procope under the London Records label. Procope played the alto-saxophone, along with Remo Biondi (rhythm guitar), Earl Backus (solo guitar), Paul Jordan (piano) Mel Schmidt (bass), and Frank Rullo (drums). Although Procope's early playing reflected the influence of Benny Carter, he had evolved a highly individual style. It combined an essentially lyrical approach with a forceful, swinging attack.

As a renowned vocal performer of Armenian traditional and gusans' music, Norayr Mnatsakanyan has become one of the most influential vocalists in the canon of Armenian national music. Owing to his dainty baritone, profound knowledge of Armenian folk music, and his mastery of the Armenian language and Armenian literature, Norayr Mnatsakanyan has been highly acclaimed among famous writers, musicologists, and Armenian folk music lovers. Norayr Mnatsakanyan was the first among Armenian vocalists to introduce a new approach to popular songs, as well as to the musical compilations of historic and contemporary gusans (Armenian minstrels). As an accepted convention of any national folklore, the works of Armenian popular and gusans music were performed in a crude, rustic, and provincial fashion. Professional performers of the opera and classical music also tried to render these works. However, their efforts to perform them alienated these works altogether from ordinary Armenian people, since the true significance of Armenian popular music could not have been properly represented by the artificially elitist operatic genre in Soviet Armenia. With his poetic approach to these great masterpieces of Armenian traditional and gusans' music, Norayr Mnatsakanyan was the first vocalist to present them in a refined and natural fashion, granting them an unprecedented simplistic register of artistic sophistication. Unlike his predecessors, Mnatsakanyan attempted to convey these works with a deep sense of harmony and in a previously impregnable unison with the authors' characteristic mentality and sentiments reflected in their compilations. At the same time, Norayr Mnatsakanyan meticulously pursued to eliminate the provincial character of the songs that had wandered among the Armenian people for centuries. Thus, Norayr Mnatsakanyan's performances are exceptional because they masterfully immerse into the poetic essence of the literary work and unify it with the melody of the song. Norayr Mnatsakanyan also performed songs by famous Armenian composers interwoven with lyrics by such famous Armenian poets, as Avetik Isahakian, Vahan Terian, Hovhannes Shiraz. Perhaps the greatest Armenian lyricist - Avetik Isahakian - highly valued Mnatsakanyan's contributions to the canon of Armenian performing arts and proclaimed Norayr \\"the velvety voice\\" of Armenia. Derenik Demirchian marvelled at Norayr's performances in the poetic circles of the old Yerevan, calling Norayr Mnatsakanyan \\"a unique vocal interpreter of the popular consciousness, scattered bits of which are present in every Armenian individual.\\" Being an art critic himself, Mnatsakanyan always conveyed great significance to the unity of the melody and the lyrics in whatever he performed.  Biography  Norayr Mnatsakanyan was born on January 7, 1923 in an old Yerevan family. He inherited the love for traditional music from his parents. Possessing an ever singing spirit of a talented youth, Norayr Mnatsakanyan won his first prize at the young performers' competition held in Moscow in 1936. Owing to his extraordinary vocal qualities and his passion for acting, Mnatsakanyan started his career as actor and singer at the Yerevan State Theater of Musical Comedy after Hakob Paronian. As surprising as it may seem, Mnatsakanyan played the first Gikor on the Armenian stage in the namesake performance based on Hovhannes Tumanyan's famous . Mnatsakanyan's artistic talent and his reverence for the Theater drove him to work with such eminent theatrical stage directors as Armen Gulakian. Mnatsakanyan also had the honor of working with the \\"titans\\" of the Armenian theatrical arts at the Yerevan State Academic Theater after Gabriel Sundukian: Vahram Papazian, Hrachia Nersisyan, Avet Avetisyan, Hambardzum Khachanyan, Babken Nersisyan, Metaksia Simonyan, the late Mher Mkrtchyan, and Khoren Abrahamyan. Norayr Mnatsakanyan's acting, apart from his artistic talent, vouched for his unsurpassed mastery of World Literature. After seeing Mnatsakanyan's rehearsal in the role of the Shakespearean Othello, Vahram Papazian highly praised Norayr for his excellent rendition of Othello's protagonistic pathos and antagonistic callousness, and foresaw a bright future for him in acting. Mnatsakanyan later played one of the leading roles in A Man from Olympus (Chelovek iz OlimpaChelovek Iz \\"Olimpa\\" (1974) on New York Times)(Armenfilm, 1974). Purporting to pursue a more worldly profession, Norayr Mnatsakanyan held a Master of Arts degree from the Department of Philology of the Yerevan State University. Upon his graduation, Mnatsakanyan defended a dissertation with a thesis on \\"Sayat Nova's Lyric Poetry in the Armenian Literary Milieux.\\" Mnatsakanyan proceeded with a professional career as a journalist and a freelance writer. With his unconventional disposition, Norayr Mnatsakanyan authored an anthology of short novels dedicated to the old city of Yerevan, depicting its people's way of life, its customs and traditions. As a journalist, Mnatsakanyan's articles and critiques on various issues of the Armenian arts and culture frequented the pages of many Armenian periodicals. One of Mnatsakanyan's most groundbreaking articles was dedicated to the famous Armenian duduk players of the past and the present: Margar Margarian, Levon Madoyan, Vatche Housepian, and Djivan Gasparyan. Mnatsakanyan also hosted a special program in 1985, the heyday of his artistic career, on the Public Television of Armenia, which was about the instrumental and stylistic distinctions of the duduk and its most outstanding players. In spite of his success in acting and his excellence in writing, Mnatsakanyan's innate predilection belonged to singing. Norayr's art of performance, his truly rich and mellow voice, as well as his unique professional approach had already made him long sought-for to Armenian music lovers both in Armenia and abroad. Subsequently, Norayr Mnatsakanyan became the ultimate crooner of Armenian performing arts after Tatoul Altunian, one of the greatest contributors to Armenian folk music, invited him to the State Philharmonic Chapel's Ensemble of Song and Dance to perform as a soloist. Here, Mnatsakanyan had the pleasure of working with Araksia Gyulzadian and Varduhi Khachatrian. Apart from his Sayat Nova repertoire, in this period, Norayr Mnatsakanyan performed popular songs and works by such famous gusans (minstrels) as: Sheram, Ashot, Jivani, Havasi, as well as famous compilations of the urban folklore. However, the inviolable right of Norayr Mnatsakanyan's achievement consists in his performances of Sayat Nova's works. His performances of Sayat Nova imbued the Bard's poetry with unprecedented lyricism and spirituality. It is through Norayr Mnatsakanyan's rendition of Sayat Nova that the ethical and metaphysical peculiarities in the works become apparent. The singer grieves and rejoices with the poet, feeling every tremble of the great Bard's heart. It is Norayr Mnatsakanyan's unforgettable voice that brings us the songs of Sayat Nova in the namesake movie (1960). Mnatsakanyan's performances became a lot more accessible to the general public, when Aram Merangulian invited Norayr to perform as a soloist in his Ensemble of Folk Instruments of the Armenian National Radio and Television. Mnatsakanyan's songs are possible to find in several Armenian films, including Sergei Parajanov's The Color of Pomegranates (1969), also dedicated to the life of Sayat Nova. A piece of Mnatsakanyan's unique rendition of the traditional Dle Yaman also appears in the background of Andrew Goldberg's The Armenian Americans (2000). A number of documentaries were shot on Mnatsakanyan's life and activity intermitted by his own performances. Throughout his lifetime, the vocalist recorded over two hundred traditional and gusans songs, all of which are held as relics by the Museum Fund of the Public Radio and Television of Armenia. His performances have paved the way for many successors in the traditional vocal genre. Norayr Mnatsakanyan performed in many countries where Armenians had set foot and had established their communities. During his tour of the Middle Eastern countries, Norayr Mnatsakanyan received an honorary gold medal from King Hussein of Jordan after his concert in Amman (1979), which His Majesty attended with Queen Noor. Mnatsakanyan's performance of Sayat Nova brought him the highest honors at the Festival of Traditional Music in Lyon, France (1981). Subsequently, upon the request of the smaller Armenian communities in Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Mnatsakanyan performed in a tributary concert at the Conservatoire de Luxembourg Hall (1981). In the annual ceremony of the Armenian Music Awards, held in Los Angeles for the year 1999, Mnatsakanyan posthumously received a lifetime achievement award for his worthwhile contributions to Armenian music, and his album of traditional and gusans' compilations, named Husher (Reminiscences) (Parseghian Records, 1999) was recognized as the year's best traditional album. In 2005, Narek Productions, with the support of the Public Radio of Armenia, launched a record, called \\"I Sing a Song,\\" composed of Norayr Mnatsakanyan's performances of the most famous Armenian gusans' works.

The village can be easily reached via car or bus. It lies close to the crossroads of two main routes, one from south to north (Prague-Písek) and the other from east to west (Březnice-Tábor). The château, Orlík Castle, stands right adjacent to the water and is surrounded by a huge castle park and a game preserve. The property belongs to the House of Schwarzenberg, but during the summer months it is open to the public on most days.

It most likely occurred on 18 July,Livy, VI.1; Plutarch, Camillus IX; Tacitus, Histories II.91 although Ovid gives a different date of 13 February.Fasti, II.195-6 Background Since the Overthrow of the Roman monarchy in 509 BC, the Roman republic and its neighbour Veii had been at peace. Conflict erupted, however, in 483 BC with a series of clashes that occurred almost annually. Rome was victorious in a close-fought battle in 480 BC; nevertheless, hostilities continued. In 479 BC, the family of the Fabii offered to take the Roman responsibility for the war upon themselves, which the Roman senate accepted.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.48 The Fabii built a camp on the Cremera, from which they harassed Veii and held back its raids on Rome.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.49 The Fabii were successful in the fighting in 478 BC and 477 BC prior to the main battle which followed.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.49-50 Account of the battle The Veientes, embarrassed by their lack of success, formed plans for an ambush of the Fabii. The Veientes led a herd of cattle along a road, at a distance from the Fabian camp at the Cremera, in order to lure the Romans from their camp and into an ambush. The Romans pursued the herd and scattered to capture the animals. At that point, the Veientes sprang from their hiding places and surrounded the Fabii. The Veientes were superior in number; however, the Romans formed a wedge formation, broke through and reached a hill, where they successfully repulsed the initial Veientine attacks, until some of the Veientes went around the Romans to attack them from the rear, uphill from the Romans.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.50 All of the Fabii were slaughtered save Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, who was too young to be sent to war.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.50 Aftermath Upon hearing of the grave defeat, the Roman senate sent the consul Titus Menenius Lanatus with an army against the Veientes, but the Romans were defeated once again. The Veientes marched on Rome, and occupied the Janiculum. There were two indecisive battles against the Veientes, the first near the temple of Spes near the Praenestine Gate, and the second at the Colline gate. Thereafter the Veientes withdrew from Rome and set about ravaging the countryside, until they were defeated by the Romans in the following year.Livy, Ab Urbe condita, ii.51 See also *Gens Fabia References ;Primary sources *, II (print: Book 1 as The Rise of Rome, Oxford University Press, 1998, ) * Dionysius of Halicarnassus: Roman antiquities at LacusCurtius, IX.

It was well received by music critics.  Content  The album's title is a reference to frontman Jason Lytle's desire to leave his home town of Modesto, California without any fuss, stating that cats will \\"do that, almost out of respect and not wanting to put people out ... because when the family cat dies, he doesn't make a big deal about it ... He just disappears\\".  Recording  Lytle spent eighteen months recording the album at a studio in Modesto, California. Regarding the recording process, Lytle noted \\"During the one-and-a-half years that I recorded this album I lost my girl, my friends, my home, estranged my family, got sober, got wasted ... I got too many things going on. The band breaking up only became a reality at the end of the recording. Many songs that people claim to be directly related to the band are actually directly related to other things I had going on.\\" The album does not feature any of the other band members, apart from Aaron Burtch who performed \\"most of\\" the album's drums. Lytle chose to credit the album to the band, stating \\"It's much more natural to imagine a band rocking out together than it is to imagine one frustrated guy at 4:30am in his boxer shorts and messed up hair, slaving over the same keyboard part for four-and-a-half hours. I recorded and wrote all of the music and the parts [but] I didn't want to distract the listener from whatever they needed to think when they heard the music.\\"  Release  Just Like the Fambly Cat was released on May 9, 2006, by record label V2. The album reached No. 171 on the Billboard 200 and No. 10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, as well as No. 50 on the UK Albums Chart.  Reception  Critical response to the album was positive. AllMusic reviewer Tim Sendra called the album \\"a fine epitaph\\". Mojo gave it three stars, as did Spin, who called it \\"equal parts bang and whimper\\". Billboard commented on the albums \\"more personal\\" lyrics and called the album \\"a worthy coda to a woefully under-appreciated band\\". The Boston Globe described it as \\"a gorgeous album that should be admired much like a fleeting sunny afternoon or a sad foreign movie viewed without subtitles\\".

It featured articles on topics including computers, technology, politics, current events, theology and philosophy. The site also contained a fiction section with short stories and poetry. History OFB was founded on October 5, 2001 as the \\"open-source migration guide\\". It was started by Timothy R. Butler after a mailing list discussion, and featured articles and white papers discussing migration to Linux. Originally, OFB featured very little original content, instead mimicking Slashdot and similar sites that included little more than a few small comments on the articles posted. Steven Hatfield helped add postings to the site. The site then started to add free and open source software news. About a month after the site was founded, the first original editorial content appeared and OFB continued to publish approximately one original work per month after that. In late April 2002, Butler announced a relaunch of the site that included a reduction in links to other sites and a further increase in original content. The relaunch also brought forth the first version of a blue sphere logo and the new tagline \\"the Independent Journal of Open Source Migration\\". On July 4, 2002, Open for Business, LinuxandMain.com, KernelTrap and Device Forge's LinuxDevices and DesktopLinux.com formed LinuxDailyNews (LDN), an aggregation site that was intended to help increase the publicity of independent open source news sites. LDN featured a center column that showed story highlights and two side columns that displayed all stories from the member sites in blocks. The site was launched as part of DesktopLinux.com's \\"wIndependence Day\\" promotion and had an early spike in popularity following a mention on Slashdot. In subsequent months, the site's traffic decreased. It was taken down in 2004 after a hacker managed to deface the site; although plans existed to restore the site, they were never followed through with and Device Forge assumed the rights to LDN's domain name. In February 2003, the site finalized its transition to an original content provider, as opposed to a site of links, by moving non- original content to a separate \\"News Watch\\" section. New contributing editor Ed Hurst began a series on his switch to FreeBSD in September 2003, beginning a long running series of FreeBSD articleshttp://www.ofb.biz/series/freebsddesktop.html that Hurst continued to add until October 2006. Butler also began OFB's coverage of Mac OS X computers. OFB's second associate editor Eduardo Sánchez returned in mid-2004 as a contributing editor. Hurst was promoted to associate editor simultaneously. The site continued in a similar fashion, with its mix of coverage on Linux, BSD and Mac OS X through early 2006. During this period it changed its motto to \\"the Independent Journal of Open Standards and Open Source\\". Due to other obligations, the site's editors ceased writing content for the site in early 2006, though it remained open during this period. On its fifth anniversary, Butler announced the relaunch of the site on October 5, 2006. The new OFB adopted the site's current general interest focus, de- emphasizing its past emphasis on Open Source and technology. The site changed its purple and blue, PHP-Nuke-based design that had been used with only minor modifications since the site's original launch, to a simpler, content-oriented design using a custom backend. The old site was archived as OFB Classic to preserve access to past articles.

Arms of Lord Beaulieu (as 1st Baron Beaulieu) Born Edward Hussey, he was the son of Irish parents, James Hussey and Catherine née Parsons (a daughter of Richard Parsons, 1st Viscount Rosse). The Hussey family had come to Ireland in 1172, and became substantial landowners in County Meath and County Kerry. The senior branch of this family held the title Baron Galtrim, although this appears to have been an Irish feudal barony rather than a peerage and did not entitle its holder to sit in the Irish House of Lords. In 1743, he married Isabella Montagu, Dowager Duchess of Manchester, a daughter of the 2nd Duke of Montagu and Lady Mary née Churchill (a daughter of the 1st Duke of Marlborough). In 1749, he legally changed his surname to Hussey-Montagu and was made a Knight Companion of the Bath in 1753. From 1758 to 1762, he was Whig Member of Parliament for Tiverton and on his retirement was raised to the Peerage as Baron Beaulieu, of Beaulieu in the County of Southampton, and later Earl Beaulieu, of Beaulieu in the County of Southampton, in 1784. Upon his death in Dover Street (off Piccadilly) in 1802, his titles became extinct as his only son, John, Lord Montagu had died in 1787. He was buried on 14 December that year at Warkton, Northamptonshire. Private life Edward Hussey had two children by Isabella Montagu : * John Hussey-Montagu, 1746-1787, MP 1772-1787, styled Baron Montagu, and * Isabella Hussey-Montagu 1750-1772; both died without descendants; and one child from Martha Howel, a. housemaid in the service of Lord Beaulieu: * Elizabeth Hussey, 1780-1865, \\"described or alleged to be his natural daughter\\" (600 descendants in October 2012, mainly in France).

History prior to 2005 The bank was founded by Cornelis van der Hoop in Rotterdam in 1895, with several branches including in The Hague. Its headquarters moved to Amsterdam some time later, at the \\" Gouden Bocht \\" at Herengracht 469 in Amsterdam. Until 2003 the bank's name was van der Hoop Effektenbank NV and it was a relatively small, specialized bank whose account holders were mainly wealthy individuals who had often been clients there for a long time. The bank was completely dependent on the securities company for its income. The new name was part of development of to offer banking services for morgages, savings and asset management to additional, less wealthy, customers. This development was not very successful. Among other things, an attempt was made to provide film financing. At the end of 2004, Van der Hoop Bankiers' balance sheet total was 403.6 million euros, and the bank had approximately 100 million euros in assets. The mortgage portfolio amounted to approximately 150 million euros. Events and bankruptcy in 2006 On December 9, 2005, the bank was found by a Dutch court to be in a financial position that required attention. Its liquidity position was found to consist of € 140 million in demands, while its credit facilities consisted of only € 68 million. Also, the Netherlands central bank was concerned about whether the bank was solvent. Van der Hoop Bankiers was declared bankrupt by the same court on December 16, 2005, when the bank showed it had a negative balance of € 9 million. Earlier in 2005, the bank had settled a claim of € 5.5 million with the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) for not paying some of the corporation taxes on its daughter companies. This dated back to 2001. The bank had set up so-called cash companies with the objective of raising more income. Such companies were considered risky. Unusually, this activity was carried out entirely in the bank's own name (through its own trust company). A bank usually only mediates in such shares and they are not held in its own name, but, after taking tax advice, the bank took the unusual course of conducting this activity entirely in its own name (through its own trust company). As a result, the profit for 2004 had to be adjusted retrospectively to a loss. On 8 June 2005, Van der Hoop's management informed the account holders by letter of the loss and announced a restructuring. A press release was also issued at the time. At the end of June 2005, it was announced that one third of the 75 jobs at the bank would be cut, which attracted media attention. Takeover and merger discussions - including with project developer LSI and the Belgian Bank DeGroof - came to nothing. At the request of the Netherlands central bank, emergency regulations were applied on 9 December, after which bankruptcy was declared on 16 December. All accounts were frozen. Bob Wessels: Annotatie bij beschikkingen rechtbankPersbericht ministerie van Financiën inzake faillissement Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck and HP de Haan were appointed as the two administrators and receivers. On 23 December 23 2005, they sent a letters to the account holders about the assets. Securities that were not in the name of the bank might still be available. The distribution lists, bankruptcy reports and other legally relevant documents are still available on the website of the law firm Houthoff [3] of the former trustee.Van der Hoop Bankiers The Hope Loss Foundation was established on 13 February 2006 as an advocate for the account holders after the bankruptcy. The board of this foundation consisted of 4 account holders at the bank and meetings were held in 2006. In the end, a lawsuit was brought by the account holders about whether DNB could recover the amounts that it was required to pay out to private account holders and small businesses under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme from the bankruptcy estate. In fact, DNB had made a mistake on this point during a creditors' meeting. The account holders group won the lawsuit; a substantive procedure was never initiated by DNB. Under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (depositogarantiestelsel) of the Netherlands central bank, account holders were eligible for compensation up to a maximum of € 20,000, and in fact received twice this protection from the scheme. Ultimately, all private savers and account holders were fully repaid their credit from the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate . However, the bank's shareholders lost their deposits permanently.

It is one of the largest performing arts centers in the United States. It covers 7.5 acres (3 hectares) in the Civic Center Historic District, and totals 7,500 seats among its venues. Performing arts Opera, symphony, modern and classical dance, theatre, recitals, plays, lectures, meetings, receptions, special screenings, and gala events all have a place and occur at the Center. History The complex was developed in the 1920s on two blocks on Van Ness Avenue facing San Francisco City Hall from the west. The \\"War Memorial\\" name commemorates all the people who served in the First World War, which ended seven years before the project commenced. It was designed by Arthur Brown Jr in 1927-1928, and is one of the last Beaux-Arts style structures erected in the United States. The project resulted in the construction of a matched pair of buildings across a formal courtyard park: the War Memorial Opera House; and the multi-purpose Veterans Building next door. Both were completed and opened in 1932. The upper floors of the Veterans Building housed the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (formerly the San Francisco Museum of Art) from 1935 to 1994. In 1980 the new Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall opened, on a site on Van Ness across the sidestreet from the Opera House, as part of the SFWMPAC complex. =United Nations= The SFWMPAC has historical significance. On June 26, 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in the Veterans Building's Herbst Theatre by the group of 50 founding nations, following the two-month-long United Nations conference in the Opera House. In 1951, the Peace Treaty with Japan (commonly called \\"Treaty of San Francisco\\"), formally ending World War II hostilities with Japan, was signed in the Opera House. The Center has been host to U.S. presidents and foreign heads of state. In 1990 the Center was chosen to host the first Goldman Environmental Prize ceremony, and this prize is now presented annually at the Center.

Upon the demise of the apartheid government and the election of President Nelson Mandela in 1994, Nqakula was elected to the National Executive Committee of the ANC. He later served as Parliamentary Counsellor to the President. On 24 January 2001 Charles Nqakula was appointed as Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, becoming Minister of Safety and Security on 7 May 2002. After President Thabo Mbeki was forced to resign in September 2008, Nqakula was moved to the post of Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Mbeki's successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, on 25 September 2008.\\"South Africa: New President Removes Health Minister\\", allAfrica.com, 25 September 2008. Unfinished business Following an inconclusive investigation in 1996 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into the 1986 aircrash in which President Samora Machel of Mozambique was killed, Charles Nqakula announced in parliament on 9 February 2006 that the inquiry is to be reopened: :\\"We owe it to the people of Mozambique to ensure the matter is thoroughly investigated,\\" Nqakula said, amid lingering suspicions that the apartheid regime's Directorate of Military Intelligence caused the presidential aircraft to crash. All of South Africa's law enforcement agencies are expected to be involved in the new inquiry, in co-operation with their Mozambican counterparts.http://www.ecr.co.za/content/view/3557/81/ Crime rate controversy Later in 2006, Nqakula outraged opposition MPs in parliament (who were not satisfied that enough was being done to counter crime), when he said that \\"South Africans who complain about the country's crime rate, should stop whining and leave the country\\". According to a United Nations Survey on Crime Trends, South Africa has the second highest murder rate in the world. South Africa also has the highest occurrence of rape in the world. Nqakula failed to realise the consequence of his statement, as many people around the world were making travel arrangements for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Nqakula was again criticized while he was in Burundi, promoting peace and democracy, while there was a spate of violent crime in Gauteng. This spate included the killings of an alarming number of people, including members of the South African Police Service killed while performing their duties. The criticism preceded a subsequent announcement by the minister that an all out effort would be made to quell the alarming increase of crime by 30 December 2006. 54 police officers have lost their lives in the first 7 months of 2006.

It is part of the municipal unit Foinikas. It is surrounded by mountains to the north and the Libyan Sea to the south. The name in Greek means \\"flat\\", because the town stands on an alluvial fan of material that has washed down the Kotsifou gorge directly to the north . This material has formed along the sea's edge into a long, fine, gold-hued sand beach, which shelves very gradually out into the bay, making it quite safe for swimming and hence, for family holidays. Initially just a fishing jetty and a few houses, Plakias developed during the last few decades into a tourist resort. The first official mention of Plakias was in 1961, when it was recorded in a census as the permanent home of six fishermen. The recorded history of surrounding mountain villages like Myrthios and Sellia goes back to the 10th century, when the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (961 AD) built roads and bridges in order to link those villages, and there are some fragments of wall remaining from a fortified area on a hill top just northeast of the present main town. The local area is geographically suitable for a settlement, having plenty of agricultural space, and there may well have been a settlement there since Minoan times. Plakias has a 1300-metre-long sandy beach and there are several other beaches within walking distance (Souda, Damnoni, Ammoudi, and Skhinaria). The southeastern end of the beach, near the Kakomouri headland, is used by nudists. The town is not on any major passage for traffic and hence traffic is minimal and it is quieter and less dusty than many other Greek resorts. Parking along the main town road is difficult in the high season, but there is a large free-parking area just east of the main town. There are plenty of places to eat along the sea front, with the biggest cluster of tavernas at the west end. 8 kilometers to the east is the historic monastery of Preveli, which may have been founded as early as the 10th century. Due to its isolated position, it has played an important role in Cretan revolts against occupying forces such as the Nazis in World War II. Plakias is home to the \\"Youth Hostel Plakias\\", set in olive groves behind the town, which is famous among international backpackers as the 'most southerly hostel' in Europe. Also well-known are the cafes \\"Nufaro\\", (known locally as \\"Joe's bar\\") and the bars \\"Ostraco\\" and \\"Cozy Backyard\\". \\"World International Tourism Day\\" is celebrated each September with a big evening festival, with a free buffet meal and free traditional music, songs, and dancing performances in the main square. There are two roads leading to Plakias through the mountain range that lies to the north, both of which run through spectacular gorges—to the north of Plakias, the Kotsifos Gorge, and to the northeast, the Kourtaliotiko Gorge. A good coastal motor track runs west beyond Souda to Rodakino beach, Frangokastello and Sfakiá. There are plenty of walks locally, and bolder walkers will enjoy the high green countryside beyond the coastal mountain range north of town. Mountain biking and cycle touring are other local attractions. There are several buses daily to and from Rethymnon bus station; some of these go via Preveli Monastery. The Plakias bus stop is on the seafront taxi rank .

Early life He was born on May 20, 1907, under the name Ait Ouarab Mohamed Idir Halo, on 4 Rue Tombouctou in the Casbah of Algiers. His family, Ait Ouarab, were originally from Taguersift near to Freha in Greater Kabylia; his father was Mohamed Ben Hadj Saîd, and his mother was Fatma Bent Boudjemaâ. His father was taken ill on the day of his birth, and had to be replaced by a maternal uncle for registering the birth, which caused an error recording his name. His uncle presented himself as such to the registry employee, by saying \\"Ana Khalou\\" (\\"I am his uncle\\" in Arabic), and the employee wrote \\"Halo\\". So he became Halo Mohamed Idir from then on. He studied in three schools from 1912 to 1918: Koranic (1912–14), Brahim Fatah (in the Casbah) from 1914–17, and another in Bouzaréah until 1918. He left school to go to work before his 11th birthday. Musical career At the age of 13, the orchestra leader sheik Mustapha Nador noticed his passion and innate sense of rhythm at a festival his group was playing at, and took him on as a Tardji (tambourine player) with his orchestra. The sheik and orchestra taught him the mandola, which became El Anka's favorite instrument. After the death of sheik Nador on May 19, 1926, in Cherchell, El Anka took over the organization of festivals for the group. The orchestra included Si Saîd Larbi (real name Birou), Omar Bébéo (Slimane Allane) and Mustapha Oulid El Meddah among others. In 1927 he began taking part in the courses taught by sheik Sid AH Oulid Lakehal, which he followed assiduously until 1932. In 1928 he was first exposed to the general public, by recording 27 discs (78 rpm) for Columbia, his first publisher, and taking part in the inauguration of Radio PTT Algiers. On August 5, 1931, popular sheik Abderrahmane Saîdi died, and El Anka helped to fill the void. His popularity, supported by the new record player and radio, only grew; he was once invited to perform for the King of Morocco. After Columbia, he made another 10 78 rpm disks with Algériaphone in 1932, and another ten 78 rpm records with Polyphone. Upon return from Mecca (in memory of which he composed the song \\"El Houdja\\") in 1937, he reformed his orchestra, and toured Algeria and France. One element of his sound that would have changed in 1932 came from a change of instruments. 1932 was the year he worked with a luthier to craft a bigger mandola. He found that the mandolas used by the orchestra were too high pitched and not loud enough. He asked a luthier to make one much bigger, and that mandole was to become his main instrument. After the Second World War, El HadJ Muhammad El Anka was invited to direct popular music on ENRS Algiers Radio which succeeded Radio PTT. The popular music he promoted from 1946 became \\"chaâbi\\". In 1955 he began teaching chaâbi as a professor at the municipal Academy of Algiers. His first pupils all became sheiks in their turn, including Amar Lâachab, Hassen Said, and Rachid Souki. In total, El Hadj El Anka wrote nearly 360 songs ( qaca' id ) and produced approximately 130 records. Notable works included \\"Lahmam lirabitou\\", \\"ltif Sebhan ellah ya\\" and \\"Win saâdi win\\". He died on November 23, 1978, in Algiers, and was buried in the El Kettar Cemetery.

For similar competitions in other countries, see autocross (disambiguation). In the United Kingdom, autocrosses are typically held on a grass or stubble surface. In fact, the attraction is the challenge of driving quickly on difficult surfaces. Cars compete individually against the clock, although more than one car may start at the same time if the circuit is long enough and wide enough. Because the course is usually bumpy and there is a risk of contact with other cars, most competitors use specially prepared cars (which vary from very inexpensive to specially engineered racers) brought on trailers. Events are usually held on a region-wide basis, with the RACMSA (Royal Automobile Club Motor Sports Association, now often called MSA overseeing rules and regulations. Some people choose to start singularly, particularly if they compete in a rally car. The sport is relatively low risk as there is or should be nothing to hit. However, if you wish, you may do double car starts. Most people opt for this, although some competitors choose to do 3 and 4 car starts whilst still competing against the clock.  History  The British autocross began in the early 1950s when clubs organized timed runs around courses set on farmers' fields. By 1954, Taunton MC organized the first ever autocross series in the United Kingdom. This, however, was only repeated in 1959 when the club was awarded the permit to hold the British National Autocross event. Shortly, thereafter, the sporting event caught on and, by 1963, the ASWMC Autocross Championship was finally launched. Presently, there are many local clubs which host across the UK, although the main regions hosting Autocross events are: AEMC for East Anglia, ANECCC - North East, and, the ASWMC for the South-West region. The ASWMC, for its part, now has 13 different Championships, which attract around 250 contenders each year. The regional autocross events also have different formats. For instance, the South West follows the traditional two-car start, except for the 4 abreast Sandocross at Weston-Super-Mare, while the North East region involves 4-car autocross.

These scriptures are believed to have contained the revelations Abraham received from God, which were written down by him as well as his scribes and followers. They are now generally believed to have perished over the course of time and are considered a lost body of scripture. Background In two surah (chapters), which are dated from the first Meccan period, there is a reference to the 'Leaves, Scrolls, Journals' (Suhuf) of Abraham (and the Scrolls of Moses), by which presumably certain divinely inspired texts handwritten by the patriarchs are meant. These passages say that the truth of God's message is present in the earliest revelations, of Abraham and Moses. Although Suhuf is generally understood to mean 'Scrolls', many translators - including Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall - have translated the verse as \\"The Books of Abraham and Moses\\". Qur'anic mention The Quran refers to certain Scrolls of Abraham, which have alternatively been translated as the Books of Abraham. All Muslim scholars have generally agreed upon that no scrolls of Abraham survive till today, and therefore this is a reference to a lost body of scripture.A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, B. M. Wheeler, Abraham The Scrolls of Abraham are understood by Muslims to refer to certain revelations Abraham received, which he would have then transmitted to writing. The exact contents of the revelation are not described in the Quran. The 87th chapter of the Quran, surah Al-Ala, concludes saying the subject matter of the surah has been in the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Moses. It is slightly indicative of what were in the previous scriptures, according to Islam: Chapter 53 of the Quran, surah An-Najm mentions some more subject matters of the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Moses. Identification Some scholars suggest the Scrolls of Abraham to be a reference to the Sefer Yetzirah, as its appendix (vi. 15) and Jewish tradition generally ascribe the reception of its revelation to Abraham. Other scholars, however, suggest it refers to the Testament of Abraham, which was also available at the time of Muhammad (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh).Tafsir and Commentary on 87: 18-19 & 53: 36-37, Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Muhammad Asad The Quran contains numerous references to Abraham, his life, prayers and traditions and has a dedicated chapter named Ibrahim (14). On a relevant note, surah Al-Kahf (18) was revealed as an answer from God to the Jews who asked Muhammad about past events. Here God directly instructed Muhammad in surah Al- Kahf (18:22), not to consult the Jews for verifying the three stories about which they inquired. The reason being God declaring He Himself is relating what needs to be verified in another verse of surah Al-Kahf (18:13) Regarding consultation with the People of the Book, it is also narrated by Abu Hureyrah in hadith literature: Therefore, in this view, Muslims would not be required to ascribe to the Sefer Yetzirah, even were it to be identified as the Scrolls of Abraham. However, Muslim theology already accepts Jewish sources such as the Torah (Tawrat) as revealed to Moses (Musa) or the Psalms (Zabur) as revealed to David (Dawud), though asserting Quranic precedence in the event of conflicting accounts.Friedmann (2003), p. 35 References Further reading =Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography= *Editions and translations: **Editio princeps: ***Mantua, 1562; HebrewBooks.org Sefer Detail: ספר יצירה -- מיוחס לאברהם אבינו **other important editions: ***Amsterdam, 1642; ***Zolkiev, 1745; ***Korzec, 1779; ***Constantinople, 1791; ***Grodno, 1806 (five commentaries); Sefer Detail: ספר יצירה -- ספר יצירה. תקס\\"ו. הורדנה. ***Warsaw, 1884 (nine commentaries); ***Goldschmidt, Das Buch der Schöpfung . . .

It is the first Italian magazine exclusively focused on comics. During a period of crisis, the magazine was not published in May and June 2013, but returned in July, published by Baldini & Castoldi. History and profile The first number of linus was published in April 1965 by Milano Libri, a subsidiary of Rizzoli, and was later published by Baldini & Castoldi in monthly issues until April 2013. Its founder was Giovanni Gandini. The magazine's name was always written in lowercase letters. It had a sister magazine, Alter, which was also a comics magazine. Both magazines had a leftist cultural stance and their editorials supported for the Italian Communist Party. The first director of linus was Giovanni Gandini. The magazine published foreign comic strips like Peanuts, Li'l Abner, Bristow, Dick Tracy, and others. linus was also the place where Italian comics found space for the first time: examples include Neutron/Valentina by Guido Crepax and Girighiz by Enzo Lunari. It was the first Italian comics magazine which featured stories read by adults. From the magazine's beginning, the comics section was accompanied by an extensive section dealing with society, politics, mass media, literature and other cultural themes. The first issue, for example, featured an interview by Umberto Eco with the novelist Elio Vittorini. Satirical strips by famous Italian authors like Altan, Alfredo Chiappori, Sergio Staino, Ellekappa, Angese, Vauro, Bruno D'Alfonso and by foreigners like Jules Feiffer were regularly published. Gandini was followed in 1972 by the intellectual, journalist, and writer Oreste del Buono. Adventures comic book series like Dick Tracy or Jeff Hawke were initially published separately on special issues. These later were moved into a monthly series, Alterlinus (later Alter Alter and simply Alter, 1974), where more adult-themed comics found place, including works by innovative French authors like Moebius, Enki Bilal or Philippe Druillet and Italian artists like Sergio Toppi, Andrea Pazienza and Lorenzo Mattotti. Pure adventure themes were published in the monthly spin-off magazine Corto Maltese, created in 1983, named after Hugo Pratt's famous character. Enzo Baldoni, the Italian journalist and writer killed in Iraq in 2004, worked as translator for linus, notably for the Doonesbury comic strip. Garry Trudeau wrote about him in his website shortly after Baldoni's murder.

Later in his career =Joint Strategic Plans & Operations Group= 1947-1949 A 1947 graduate of the Air War College, Montgomery became a member of the Joint Strategic Plans and Operations Group for General Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo. The following year he joined the 51st Fighter Wing at Naha Air Force Base, Okinawa. Flying then the new F-80 jet \\"Shooting Star\\" aircraft, the 51st Jet Fighter Wing pioneered in long overwater mass jet training flights in the Far East under Montgomery's leadership. =Deputy commander Briggs Air Force Base= 1949-1952 Returning to the U.S. in 1949, he was assigned to Biggs Air Force Base in Texas and early in 1950 became deputy commander of the 97th Bombardment Wing located there. His assignment to SAC headquarters followed that tour of duty. A veteran of more than 30 years Air Force service, Montgomery was twice awarded the Legion of Merit while serving with the Strategic Air Command. =Aviation cadet training program/model basic flying school= 1947-1949 Throughout his earlier years in the air corps, Montgomery held varied staff and command assignments. His first wartime job was concerned with organization of the aviation cadet training program. During this period he established a model Basic Flying School at Independence, Kansas. Later he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Chief, Air Staff Training, Army Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon, where his extensive field experience was brought to bear on the entire Air Force wartime training program.

U.S. Army's Iraq War General Stanley McChrystal describes the Quds Force as an organization analogous to a combination of the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the United States. Responsible for extraterritorial operations, the Quds Force supports non-state actors in many countries, including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the State of Palestine's Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Yemeni Houthis, and Shia militias in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. The Quds Force reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei.Dionisi, 7 After Qassem Soleimani was killed, his deputy, Esmail Ghaani, replaced him. The U.S. Secretary of State designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Quds Force as a FTO based on the IRGC’s “continued support to and engagement in terrorist activity around the world.” This was the first time that the U.S. ever designated another government’s department as a FTO. Name While the formation's official name is Quds Force (), it has also been referred to as the 'Quds Corps' () in Persian media. History and mission The predecessor of the Quds Force, known as 'Department 900', was created during the Iran–Iraq War as a special intelligence unit, while the IRGC was allegedly active abroad in Afghanistan before the war. The department was later merged into 'Special External Operations Department'. After the war in 1988, the IRGC was reorganized and the Quds Force was established as an independent service branch. It has the mission of liberating \\"Muslim land\\", especially al-Quds, from which it takes its name—\\"Jerusalem Force\\" in English. Both during and after the war, it provided support to the Kurds fighting Saddam Hussein. In 1982, a Quds unit was deployed to Lebanon, where it assisted in the genesis of Hezbollah. The Force also expanded its operations into neighboring Afghanistan, including assistance for Abdul Ali Mazari's Shi'a Hezbe Wahdat in the 1980s against the government of Mohammad Najibullah. It then began funding and supporting Ahmad Shah Massoud's Northern Alliance against the Taliban. However, in recent years, the Quds Force is alleged to have been helping and guiding the Taliban insurgents against the NATO-backed Karzai administration. There were also reports of the unit lending support to Bosnian Muslims fighting the Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War.Hirsh, Michael; Dehghanpisheh, Babak; Hosenball, Mark. \\"The New Enemy? \\", Newsweek, 15 February 2007.

Retrieved 7 January 2006. In January 2010, according to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the mission of the Quds Force was expanded and the Force along with Hezbollah started a new campaign of attacks targeting not only the US and Israel but also other Western bodies. In January 2020, Quds Force commander Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed by a US airstrike on his convoy outside Baghdad International Airport. Organization Eight directorates of Quds Force operations according to David Dionisi The force is described as \\"active in dozens of countries.\\"Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows: the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, pp. 332–333. According to former U.S. Army intelligence officer David Dionisi, the Quds force is organized into eight different directorates based on geographic location: * Western countries (including the former Eastern Bloc) * Former Soviet Union * Iraq * Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India * Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan * Turkey * North Africa * Arabian peninsula According to journalist Dexter Filkins, the force's members are \\"divided between combatants and those who train and oversee foreign assets,\\" and the force is divided into branches focusing on \\"intelligence, finance, foreign languages, politics, sabotage, and special operations.\\" Members are chosen both for their skill and \\"allegiance to the doctrine of the Islamic Revolution.\\"Filkins, Dexter\\"The Shadow Commander \\"The New Yorker, 30 September 2013. In addition, Dionisi asserts in his book American Hiroshima that the Iranian Quds Force headquarters for operations in Iraq was moved in 2004 to the Iran-Iraq border in order to better supervise activities in Iraq. The Quds Force also operates a base in the former compound of the U.S. Embassy, which was overrun in 1979. According to Filkins and American General Stanley A. McChrystal, it was the Quds Force that \\"flooded\\" Iraq with \\"explosively formed projectiles\\" which fire a molten copper slug able to penetrate armor, and which accounted for \\"nearly 20%\\" of American combat deaths in Iraq (i.e. hundreds of soldiers). In September 2007, a few years after the publication of American Hiroshima: The Reasons Why and a Call to Strengthen America's Democracy in July 2006, General David Petraeus reported to Congress that the Quds Force had left Iraq. Petraeus said, \\"The Quds Force itself, we believe, by and large, those individuals have been pulled out of the country, as have the Lebanese Hezbollah trainers that were being used to augment that activity.\\" On 7 July 2008, journalist Seymour Hersh wrote an article in The New Yorker revealing that President Bush had signed a Presidential Finding authorizing the CIA and Joint Special Operations Command to conduct cross-border paramilitary operations from Iraq and Afghanistan into Iran. These operations would be against the Quds Force and \\"high-value targets.\\" \\"The Finding was focused on undermining Iran's nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change,\\" a person familiar with its contents said, and involved \\"working with opposition groups.\\" =Size= The size of the Quds Force is classified and unknown.

The 2020 edition of The Military Balance, published by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), estimated that the force has about 5,000 personnel. = Financing = Companies controlled by the Quds Force maintain banking relationships with the Bank of Kunlun, a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation. =Outside analysis= While it reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, there are debates over how independently Quds Force operates. Mahan Abedin, director of research at the London-based Center for the Study of Terrorism (and editor of Islamism Digest), believes the unit is not independent: \\"Quds Force, although it's a highly specialized department, it is subject to strict, iron-clad military discipline. It's completely controlled by the military hierarchy of the IRGC, and the IRGC is very tightly controlled by the highest levels of the administration in Iran.\\" According to a Los Angeles Times report, in Abedin's view, \\"[I]t's a very capable force—their people are extremely talented, [and] they tend to be the best people in the IRGC\\". Activities The Quds Force trains and equips foreign Islamic revolutionary groups around the Middle East. The paramilitary instruction provided by the Quds Force typically occurs in Iran or Sudan. Foreign recruits are transported from their home countries to Iran to receive training. The Quds Force sometimes plays a more direct role in the military operations of the forces it trains, including pre-attack planning and other operation-specific military advice.Dionisis, 8 =Afghanistan= Since 1979, Iran had supported the Shi'a Hezbe Wahdat forces against the Afghan government of Mohammad Najibullah. When Najibullah stepped down as President in 1992, Iran continued supporting Hezbe Wahdat against other Afghan militia groups. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996, Hezbe Wahdat had lost its founder and main leader, Abdul Ali Mazari, so the group joined Ahmad Shah Massoud's Northern Alliance. Iran began supporting the Northern Alliance against the Taliban, who were backed by Pakistan and the Arab world. In 1999, after several Iranian diplomats were killed by the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif, Iran nearly got into a war with the Taliban.Karon, Tony. \\"TIME.com Primer: The Taliban and Afghanistan \\", Time Magazine, 18 September 2001.

He also explained that the squad was made up of men from the Lebanese \\"Hezbollah\\" and soldiers from the Syrian Special Forces, who had undergone special training under the guidance of Iranian instructors. Apart from this fact, the Syrian soldiers were familiar with the terrain. The general assumed command of the ground operation and Russian aircraft had to carry out air cover and enable satellite surveillance. Once the location of the Russian pilot was determined via satellite through the built-in GPS device, it became clear that the pilot was located six kilometers behind the front line of the opposition forces. The Special squad that entered the territory controlled by rebels was not only able to save the Russian pilot, but also kill all of the remaining rebels there.

A benevolent dictator may allow for some civil liberties or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referenda or elected representatives with limited power, and often makes preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term. It might be seen as a republican form of enlightened despotism. The label has been applied to leaders such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey (1923–1938), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia (1953–1980), \\"...All Yugoslavs had educational opportunities, jobs, food, and housing regardless of nationality. Tito, seen by most as a benevolent dictator, brought peaceful co-existence to the Balkan region, a region historically synonymous with factionalism.\\" Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore (1959–1990), Abd al- Karim Qasim of Iraq (1958-1963) and France-Albert René of Seychelles (1977–2004).  Characteristics  The idea of benevolent dictatorship has a long history, dating back to various positively perceived rulers during ancient times, where authoritarian leadership was the norm. Modern usage of the term in a world society where the norm leans much more toward democracy can be traced back to John Stuart Mill in his classic On Liberty (1869). Although he argued in favor of democratic rights for individuals, he did make an exception for what he called today's developing countries: > We may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which > the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. Despotism is [...] > legitimate [...] in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their > improvement [...]. Liberty [...] has no application to any state of things > anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by > free and equal discussion. Benevolent dictator was also a popular rhetoric in the early 20th century as a support for colonial rulings. A British colonial official called Lord Hailey said in the 1940s \\"A new conception of our relationship...may emerge as part of the movement for the betterment of the backward peoples of the world.\\" Hailey conceived economic development as a justification for colonial power. In the Spanish language, the pun word dictablanda is sometimes used for a dictatorship conserving some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy. The pun is that, in Spanish, dictadura is \\"dictatorship\\", dura is \\"hard\\" and blanda is \\"soft\\". Analogously, the same pun is made in Portuguese as ditabranda or ditamole. In February 2009, the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo ran an editorial classifying the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964–1985) as a \\"ditabranda\\", creating controversy. Mancur Olson characterized benevolent dictators as \\"not like the wolf that preys on the elk, but more like the rancher who makes sure his cattle are protected and are given water\\".  Modern examples  = Mustafa Kemal Atatürk = 200px During his leadership of the Turkish War of Independence from 1919 to 1923 and his presidency from 1923 to 1938, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is credited with removing foreign influence from former Ottoman territory, and is looked fondly upon as the founder of modern Turkey in the form of a republic. He presided over a series of reforms such as allowing women to vote, agrarian land reform, removal of Islam as the state religion and the establishment of secularism, modernization of the language and education, and the adoption of a Western- based law instead of sharia. = Josip Broz Tito = Josip Broz Tito in 1949 Although Josip Broz Tito led the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as Prime Minister and President (later President for Life) from 1944 until his death in 1980 under what many criticized as authoritarian rule,Naming Street After Tito Unconstitutional. Slovenia Times, 5 October 2011 http://www.sloveniatimes.com/naming-street-after-tito-unconstitutional he was widely popular and was \\"seen by most as a benevolent dictator\\". He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly, State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992; Palgrave Macmillan, 1997 p. 36 \\"...Of course, Tito was a popular figure, both in Yugoslavia and outside it.\\" Viewed as a unifying symbol,Martha L. Cottam, Beth Dietz-Uhler, Elena Mastors, Thomas Preston, Introduction to political psychology, Psychology Press, 2009 p. 243 \\"...Tito himself became a unifying symbol. He was charismatic and very popular among the citizens of Yugoslavia.\\" his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. The country's economy underwent a period of prosperity under the system of workers' self- management devised by his deputy Edvard Kardelj. Tito gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement.Peter Willetts, The non-aligned movement: the origins of a Third World alliance (1978) p. xiv This perception has changed significantly in anti-communist circles following the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the examination of various war crimes committed by the Yugoslav Partisans in the aftermath of World War II and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia during its rule, namely the Bleiburg repatriations, the Foibe massacres, Tezno massacre, Macelj massacre, Kočevski Rog massacre, Barbara Pit massacre and the communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45. However, Tito's legacy as the leader of the movement which liberated Yugoslavia from Nazi German and Fascist Italian occupation is still officially respected in all former Yugoslav countries. Although maintaining nominal leadership over the Party, State and Army, Tito skillfully used his personal authority and popularity to decentralize and \\"liberalize\\" Yugoslavia through the careful process of \\"Federating the federation\\", as defined by his close advisor and collaborator Vladimir Bakarić. From the early 1960s he supported a series of reforms, such as the adoption of a new Constitution in 1963, a large-scale Economic Reform program in 1965, further amendments to the Constitution in 1966, 1968, 1971 and finally the adoption of a new Constitution in 1974, which was hailed as the beginning of a truly self- managing, democratic society. The 1971 Constitutional Amendments introduced a rotating Presidency consisting of eight members, one from each Republic and Province, instead of the classic centralized-style office of President which was in place before decentralization. The 1974 Constitution guaranteed de jure \\"...the right to self-determination, including secession...\\" to every Republic, reducing the power of the central, federal government over the individual governments of each republic, making Yugoslavia a true confederation. = Lee Kuan Yew = Lee Kuan Yew in 1965 Since its independence in 1965, Singapore in just a few decades has transformed from a relatively underdeveloped and impoverished agrarian society into Asia's most developed nation and one of the wealthiest, as a center of aviation, international banking, business, tourism and shipping. Singapore has thus been dubbed as one of the Four Asian Tigers. Lee Kuan Yew and his administration wielded absolute reign over Singaporean politics until 1990, while his People's Action Party has remained in power ever since, controlling Singapore as a dominant-party state. Lee is therefore often called a 'benevolent dictator.' As a leader who was in power for thirty-one years from 1959 until 1990, he implemented some laws that were deemed to be autocratic, and attempted to dismantle political opposition. Despite this, he is reportedly often looked upon favorably by Singaporeans for his transformation of Singapore. Peter Popham of The Independent called Lee \\"one of the most successful political pragmatists\\". Ever since Lee's resignation as Prime Minister in 1990 and his death in 2015, Singapore has undergone democratization with improved rule of law.Democracy Index Despite this, the government of Singapore is still being criticized by other political parties for not allowing complete and unrestricted freedom of speech. = France- Albert René = Although France-Albert René seized power in a coup, his one- party socialist rule in Seychelles rapidly developed the country since its independence. His administration established various administrative, public and educational institutions, created a universal health care system, and brought the national literacy rate to 90%. = Gamal Abdel Nasser = Gamal Abdel Nasser, an Arab nationalist, socialist, anti-imperialist and anti- Zionist, seized de facto power over Egypt in a military coup in 1952 as Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, later being officially sworn in as President in 1956. Nasser's policies included the nationalisation of finance, heavy industry and shipping, a far-reaching land reform program which saw land ownership limited to 100 feddans, instituted a minimum wage for farmers and established agricultural cooperatives, pursuit of Arab unity, secularism, close cooperation with the Soviet Union, opposition to Israel and the United States, the nationalisation of the Suez Canal as well as large scale infrastructure projects and industrialisation, such as the Aswan Dam and the Helwan steelworks. Under Nasser, Egyptians enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment as well as other forms of social welfare, while aristocratic influence waned.Cook 2011, p. 111https://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/501/nasser2.htm Nasser's socialist policies, known as Nasserism, proved successful, with economic growth of around 9% for a decade.Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.48 Egypt industrialised rapidly as a consequence of Nasser's policies.Aburish 2004, pp. 138–139 Politically, Nasser set up a one-party state, under the direction of the Arab Socialist Union and he nationalised the press. He did however institute a law which guaranteed at least 50% of seats in Egypt's parliament, the People's Assembly, to workers and peasants. He also prepared for political democratisation, but the latter plans were derailed by his death in 1970. By the time of his death, Nasser was immensely popular and widely viewed as the leader of the Arab world. Nasser's popularity was exemplified in the fact that when he announced his resignation in the wake of Egypt's defeat in the Six Day War, this announcement was met with widespread protests which demanded that Nasser remain President, a demand which Nasser accepted.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400128/Nasser-resigns-crowds-in- Cairo-weep.html = Paul Kagame = Once commander of rebel force during Rwandan civil war, Paul Kagame was sworn in as the president of Rwanda in 2000. Despite the accusation of political repression, he is considered very successful in transforming Rwanda. Kagame launched a national development programme called Vision 2020, Its main objective is transforming the country into a knowledge-based middle-income country, thereby reducing poverty, health problems and making the nation united and democratic. Under his rule Rwanda became one of the cleanest countries in Africa, his rule also oversaw economic growth and a significant reduction of poverty.http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/120328/rwanda- economic-growth-pulling-rwandans-out-poverty Under his rule, Rwanda is also called the \\"Singapore of Africa\\" due to his effort modernizing post-war Rwanda which he also dubbed as \\"African Lee Kuan Yew\\".https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapores-visionary-mr-lee-kuan- yew-inspires-followers-in-africa-including-Rwanda  See also  * Absolute monarchy * Benevolent dictator for life (related concept in terms of software) * Dictablanda * Enlightened absolutism * Meritocracy * Philosopher king * Separation of powers * Social planner * Soft despotism  References  Political systems Oligarchy ","title":"Benevolent dictatorship"},{"id":"4028378","text":"Tilt is an English group of electronic record producers, composed of Mick Park and Nic Britton.

Biography Born in Greenville, South Carolina, Anderson lost both parents when he was four years old, and was sent to live at the Jenkins Orphanage in Charleston, where he learned to play trumpet. Classmates gave him the nickname \\"Cat\\" (which he used all his life) based on his fighting style. He toured and made his first recording with the Carolina Cotton Pickers, a small group based at the orphanage. After leaving the Cotton Pickers, Anderson played with guitarist Hartley Toots, Claude Hopkins' big band, Doc Wheeler's Sunset Orchestra (1938-1942), with whom he also recorded, Lucky Millinder, the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra, Sabby Lewis's Orchestra, and Lionel Hampton, with whom he recorded the classic \\"Flying Home No. 2\\". Anderson's career took off, however, in 1944, when he joined Duke Ellington's orchestra at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia. He quickly became a central part of Ellington's sound. Although Anderson was a very versatile musician, capable of playing in a number of jazz styles (Leonard Feather described his style as \\"somewhere between Louis Armstrong and Harry James), he is most renowned for his abilities in the extreme high or \\"altissimo\\" range. He had a big sound in all registers, but could play up to a \\"triple C\\" (the highest Bb note on a piano keyboard) with great power (he was able to perform his high- note solos without a microphone, while other members of a big band were usually amplified for their solos). Wynton Marsalis called him \\"one of the best\\" high-note trumpeters.Trumpet Kings. Dir. Burrill Crohn. Perf. Wynton Marsalis, Louis Armstrong, et al. Video Artists International, Inc., 1989. Videocassette. But he was much more than just a high-note trumpeter - he was also a master of half valve and plunger mute playing. Dan Morgenstern said of him that \\"he was...the band's Number One utility trumpeter, capable of filling in for anyone else who was not there.\\" He played with Ellington's band from 1944 to 1947, from 1950 to 1959, and from 1961 to 1971, with each break corresponding to a brief hiatus to lead and front his own big band. In addition to his work on trumpet, he was a very skilled arranger and composer - he performed his own compositions \\"El Gato\\" and Bluejean Beguine\\" with Ellington, and others of his compositions and arrangements with his own band, for example on his 1959 record album for Mercury, \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Horn.\\" After 1971, Anderson settled in the Los Angeles area, where he continued to play studio sessions, to perform with local bands (including Louie Bellson's and Bill Berry's big bands), and to tour Europe. He died of brain cancer in 1981.

All trams of this type were built by the Finnish metal industry corporation Valmet between the years 1973 and 1975. Between 1993 and 2004 all trams in the class were modernised by HKL and redesignated as Nr I+ class. Currently HKL classifies them as NRV I. Overview Nr I were the first type of articulated tram operated by the HKL. The design of the Nr I type trams was based on the GT6 type trams built by Düwag for various cities in western Europe since 1956, but the Nr I incorporated several technological innovations that had not been available when the GT6 was designed. The Nr I trams were delivered by Valmet between 1973 and 1975, with the first seven trams delivered in 1973, further 18 delivered in 1974 and the final 15 in 1975. As the first mass-produced tram type in the world, the Nr I featured thyristor chopper control. The first tram of this class entered revenue-earning service on 16 December 1973 on line 10. Although the trams of this type are numbered 31 to 70, the first unit was not the 31st tram to be used by the HKL. The HKL tram numbering system had been reset in 1959, with the numbering of new trams delivered that year beginning from 1. In the early 80s the city of Gothenburg, the forerunner in creation of modern light rail systems in Europe, wished to purchase Nr I -based trams from Valmet for its own tram network. However, due to pressure from the Swedish government, Göteborgs spårvägar were forced to place an order with the Swedish ASEA instead. In Helsinki a further developed version of the Nr I, the Nr II class, was delivered by Valmet for HKL between 1983 and 1987. The Nr II class trams have an identical external appearance and very similar interior layout to the Nr I class. From November 1993 onwards, starting with tram number 45, all Nr I units were modernised by HKL into Nr I+ class. The modernisation included updates to the technics of the trams, changes to the interior layout, addition of electronic displays displaying the name of the next stop, as well as replacement of the original seats with new ones. The last tram to be modernised was number 53, modernised in July 2004. A second modernisation process, labelled \\"life extension programme\\" by the HKL, begun in 2005. Like the earlier process, this programme includes updating much of the technics and changes to the interiors. Additionally the chassis of the trams will be sand- blasted and given a new surface finish. For some trams the life extension programme will be carried out in Germany. Liveries For the Nr I type trams, HKL decided to adopt a new livery. Instead of the traditional green/yellow colours, the new trams were painted light grey, with an orange stripes running along the top and bottom of the carriage. In 1986 HKL decided to abandon the unpopular orange/grey livery, and by 1995 all trams of this type were painted in the green/yellow colours, with the top half of the tram painted yellow and the bottom half green. Tram number 45, the first to be modernised into Nr I+ class, was painted in an experimental livery coinciding with the modernisation. The livery was identical with the standard green/yellow colours, but had an additional narrow yellow stripe running along the bottom of the carriage. This livery was not adapted to any other trams, and number 45 later reverted to the standard livery. The interior of a Nr I tram after the 1st modernisation process. Interior layout and design As built the Nr I class trams had a seating capacity of 41, with approximately 100 standing places, with the exception of the last tram of the class, number 70, which only had 39 passenger seats. Subsequently, the number of seats in all units was redecued by two, bringing the seating capacity down to 39 for numbers 31–69 and 37 for number 70. From 1982 onwards the conductor's seat was removed from all units (from thereon tickets were sold by the driver), and coinciding with this the seating arrangements of all Nr I trams was standardised to 39 passenger seats. Following the 1993–2004 modernisation process, HKL officially gives the seating capacity of all units as 39, with 106 standing places. Originally the seats of the Nr I class were covered beige-coloured artificial leather upholstery. As a part of the first modernisation process the original seats were substituted with ones upholstered in green fabric and featuring headrests made from green plastic. Future HKL are planning to order 40 new low-floor trams to enter service between 2009 and 2016. Coinciding with this, some of the Nr I class units are planned to be withdrawn from service. The Nr II class trams have been fitted with a low-floor midsection from 2006 onwards, and fitting the Nr I class units with similar midsections to increase their lifespan is also reported to be under consideration (as of June 2008).

Lobby Tunnel was a nightclub in New York City, located at 220 Twelfth Avenue, in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.\\"Same Scene, Different Security, in Reopened Club\\" New York Times (October 14, 1996) It operated from 1986 to 2001. The nightclub was located within the Terminal Warehouse Company Central Stores Building, also known as Chelsea Terminal Warehouse, which is now part of the West Chelsea Historic District.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. \\"West Chelsea Historic District Designation Report\\" p.87 History Tunnel, better known as \\"The Tunnel,\\" was owned by Boaz Aharoni, a real-estate developer, and Elli Dayan, founder and former chairman of Bonjour International, a company best known for blue jeans. The club was built in a space which was formerly a railroad freight terminal. Dayan sold the property to Marco Riccota in January 1990. Peter Gatien acquired the 80,000-square-foot nightclub in 1992. Tunnel closed its doors late in 2001 due to non-payment of rent and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's quality-of-life campaign. Gatien had been accused of drug trafficking, charges he was acquitted of, although he and his wife pleaded guilty to tax evasion and were deported to Canada in 2003.  Description  The club was named for the tunnel-like shape of the main room, in which train tracks from the early 1900s ran through a sunken area of the dance floor. These were a relic of an era in which railroad sidings from the Eleventh Avenue freight line of the New York Central Railroad ran directly into warehouse buildings in that area, so that goods could be transferred to and from freight cars which were floated across the Hudson on barges from Hoboken. The club was architecturally distinctive: a long, narrow space with multiple rooms on several levels. The dance floor featured several dance cages. The decor of the club changed frequently. One room, decorated by artist Kenny Scharf, was called the Kenny Scharf Lava Lounge. Others were decorated as Victorian libraries, S/M dungeons, and lounges. The club featured unisex bathrooms, which were the converted locker rooms formerly used by the freight terminal's workers. They had modern stalls with partitions and doors for privacy, extant rows of old lockers attached to the wall, as well as marks where the former shower stalls had been removed. In the late 1980s, Club Kids, including Michael Alig, Amanda Lepore, and RuPaul, often gathered in the V.I.P. room in the basement. During its lifespan, Tunnel frequently hosted Junior Vasquez, Danny Tenaglia, Jonathan Peters, Little Louie Vega, DJ Renegade, Eddie Baez, DJ Justin Time, DJ Corbett, DJ DA, Bobby Rios and Hex Hector after the close of the original Sound Factory in the mid-1990s. It later presented Kurfew, a trance-techno oriented Saturday night party started by promoter Jeff Brenner and hosted by talent such as Lady Bunny, DJ Urbanox, Peppermint, DJ Vito Fun, DJ Michael T, Amanda Lepore, DJ Jason, and DJ Steve Sidewalk and introducing young clubbers to talent including Danny Tenaglia, Jonny McGovern, and Cazwell (as Morplay). While the club attracted primarily gay audiences, it also attracted members of the hip hop community. One advantage of the multiple rooms of the club was the ability to host different types of parties, with as many as five or more DJs spinning different styles of music to varying crowds. In 1998, DJ Amadeus was named the resident DJ at Tunnel.

A stud animal is a registered animal retained for breeding. The terms for the male of a given animal species (stallion, bull, rooster, etc.) usually imply that the animal is intact—that is, not castrated—and therefore capable of siring offspring. A specialized vocabulary exists for de-sexed animals (gelding, steer, etc.) and those animals used in grading up to a purebred status. Stud females are generally used to breed further stud animals, but stud males may be used in crossbreeding programs.Stud ewes Retrieved on 15 October 2008 Both sexes of stud animals are regularly used in artificial breeding programs. A stud farm, in animal husbandry, is an establishment for selective breeding using stud animals.Taylor, Peter, Pastoral Properties of Australia, George Allen & Unwin, Sydney, London, Boston,1984 This results in artificial selection. Stud fees A stud fee is a price paid by the owner of a female animal, such as a horse or a dog, to the owner of a male animal for the right to breed to it. Service fees can range from a small amount for a local male animal of unknown breeding to several hundred thousand dollars for the right to breed a champion Thoroughbred race horse such as Storm Cat, who has earned stud fees of up to US$500,000. Many owners of high-quality stallions also offer a live foal guarantee with a breeding, usually defined as a guarantee that once the mare leaves the stud farm confirmed to be in foal by a veterinarian, she will give birth to a foal that stands and nurses, or else the stud farm will re-breed the mare for no stud fee the following season. Most stud fees do not include the costs of boarding the female animal at the location of the stud animal, or of the cost, collecting and shipping semen if artificial insemination is used in lieu of live cover.

Autumn's musical style is described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all- female backup dancers The Bloody Crumpets, Autumn incorporates elements of classical music, cabaret, electronica, and glam rock with theatrics, and burlesque. Growing up in Malibu, California, Autumn began learning the violin at the age of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced eight or nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music, she studied under various teachers and went to Indiana University, which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own independent label Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo, followed by the release in 2003 of her album Enchant. Autumn appeared in singer Courtney Love's backing band on her 2004 America's Sweetheart tour and returned to Europe. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as Laced with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New York based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. In 2012, she released the album Fight Like a Girl. She played the role of Painted Doll in Darren Lynn Bousman's 2012 film The Devil's Carnival, as well as its 2015 sequel, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival. Life and career =1979–2000: Beginnings= Autumn attributes her ability to write music in her mind to the fact that as a child, she played Pachelbel's Canon in D (pictured) mentally every night. Emilie Autumn was born in Los Angeles, California, on September 22, 1979. Autumn grew up in Malibu, California. She has stated that \\"being surrounded by nature and sea had a lot to do with [her] development as a 'free spirit.'\\" Her mother worked as a seamstress, and she has said that her father was a German immigrant with whom she did not share a close relationship. While not musicians, her family enjoyed various genres of music. When Autumn was four years old, Autumn started learning the violin, and later commented: \\"I remember asking for a violin, but I don't remember knowing what one was. I might have thought it was a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed.\\" Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, \\"I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, there seemed to be no reason to go anymore, so I just didn't.\\" She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of \\"violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz\\". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer. While convinced that she would only play violin, eighteen-year-old Autumn decided to sing on one of her songs as a way of demonstrating to a major music producer, who wanted to sign her on a label, how it should sound. She became unhappy with the changes done to her songs, and decided to break away from the label and create her own independent record label, Traitor Records. Through it, she debuted with her classical album On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo, which she recorded in 1997 when she was seventeen years old; its title refers to the fact that the album took only a day to record. It consists of her performing works for the baroque violin accompanied by Roger Lebow on the baroque cello, Edward Murray on harpsichord, and Michael Egan on lute. She considered it \\"more of a demo despite its length\\", and released it as \\"a saleable album\\" after fans who enjoyed her \\"rock performances starting asking for a classical album so that they could hear more of the violin.\\" She also debuted with her poetry book Across the Sky & Other Poems in 2000, later re-released in 2005 as Your Sugar Sits Untouched with a music-accompanied audiobook. =2001–04: Enchant and collaborations= As part of a recording project, Autumn traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001, and decided to stay because she enjoyed the public transportation system and music scene there. She released the 2001 EP Chambermaid while finishing Enchant—she alternatively labeled the musical style on Chambermaid as \\"fantasy rock\\" and cabaret—and wrote the 2001 charity single \\"By the Sword\\" after the events of September 11, 2001. According to her, the song is about strength, not violence; the act of swearing by the sword represents \\"an unbreakable promise to right a wrong, to stay true\\". On February 26, 2003, Autumn released her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: \\"new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music\\". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant revolved around the supernatural realm and its effect on the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as \\"fantasy rock\\", which dealt with \\"dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head off if you dare to touch them\\". The faery-themed \\"Enchant Puzzle\\" appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchants release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, \\"a classical baroque ensemble\\" that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks—a woman executed for witchcraft. On the night of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals, Autumn appeared in Love's backing band The Chelsea—Radio Sloan, Dvin Kirakosian, Samantha Maloney, and Lisa Leveridge—on the 2004 tour. Much of Autumn's violin work did not get released on the album; she commented: \\"This had to do entirely with new producers taking over the project after our little vacation in France, and carefully discarding all of our sessions.\\" She performed live with Love and The Chelsea on Late Show with David Letterman on March 17, 2004, and at Bowery Ballroom the next day. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap—both products she sold in her online \\"web design and couture fashion house\\", WillowTech House. On December 23, 2004, she appeared on the Chicago- based television station WGN as part of the string quartet backing up Billy Corgan and Dennis DeYoung's duet of \\"We Three Kings\\". =2005–09: Opheliac, Laced/Unlaced, and A Bit o' This & That= The title of Opheliac is a reference to Shakespeare's character Ophelia (above) from the play Hamlet, whom Autumn felt a connection to, and the archetype of the \\"self-destructive\\" woman. Autumn began work on her concept album Opheliac in August 2004, and recorded it at Mad Villain Studios in Chicago. In August 2005, she created the costumes for Corgan's music video for the track \\"Walking Shade\\"; she also contributed violin and vocals for the track \\"DIA\\" from his 2005 album TheFutureEmbrace. In late 2005, Autumn also recorded vocals and violin for \\"The Gates of Eternity\\" from Attrition's 2008 album All Mine Enemys Whispers: The Story of Mary Ann Cotton, a concept album focusing on the Victorian serial killer Mary Ann Cotton. Autumn later protested the release of the song, claiming that it was unfinished, \\"altered without her permission\\", and had been intended only as a possible collaboration with Martin Bowes. In January 2006, Autumn performed a song from the album, \\"Misery Loves Company\\", on WGN, before the album's release by the German label Trisol Music Group in September. She released the limited-edition, preview EP Opheliac through her own label, Traitor Records, in spring 2006; while the Opheliac EPs were being shipped, Autumn claimed that her offices had been robbed, causing the delay in the album release and the shipping of the EPs. According to her, Opheliac \\"was the documentation of a completely life-changing and life-ending experience\\". At one time, Autumn did have plans to film a music video for her song \\"Liar\\", which included \\"bloody bathtubs\\". Her song \\"Opheliac\\" later appeared on the 2007 albums 13th Street: The Sound of Mystery, Vol. 3, published by ZYX Music, and Fuck the Mainstream, Vol. 1, published by Alfa Matrix on June 19. On October 9, 2006, she appeared on the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse as a guest artist and on the subsequent 2007 album The Dethalbum. November 2006 saw the release of the EP Liar/Dead Is the New Alive, which featured remixes of songs from Opheliac and new material. Autumn released her instrumental album, Laced/Unlaced in March 2007; it consisted of two discs: Laced, the re-release of On a Day..., and Unlaced, new songs for the electric violin. She decided to re-release On a Day as Laced because she \\"felt that it made a nice contrast to the metal shredding fiddle album, \\"Unlaced\\", and [...] loved that it was the perfect representation of \\"then\\" versus \\"now\\". She also performed live at the German musical events Wave Gotik Treffen and M'era Luna Festival in 2007. She later released A Bit o' This & That: a rarities album of her covers, including songs from The Beatles and The Smiths, classical pieces, and her own songs. In 2008, she released the EP 4 o'Clock, which contained remixes of songs from Opheliac, new songs, and a reading from her autobiographical novel The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls. She also released another EP, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun &Bohemian; Rhapsody, the same year. A year later, Autumn broke away from Trisol Music Group to join The End Records and re-release Opheliac in the United States on October 27, 2009; previously, it was only available there as an import. The re-release included extras such as pictures, bonus tracks, an excerpt from The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, and a video. In addition to releasing her own material, Autumn collaborated with other musicians. She contributed backing vocals and violin to the track \\"Dry\\" by Die Warzau and made an appearance in the band's music video for \\"Born Again\\". She played violin on the song \\"UR A WMN NOW\\" from OTEP's 2009 album, Smash the Control Machine. Additionally, two of her tracks appeared in film soundtracks: \\"Organ Grinder\\" from 4 o'Clock on the European edition of Saw III and a remixed version of \\"Dead Is The New Alive\\" from Opheliac on the international version of Saw IV. =2010–present: Fight Like a Girl= Autumn performs \\"Liar\\" in Manchester, England, April 2012 In June 2010, Autumn released the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on her Twitter account, before revealing the full title as Fight Like a Girl. In her words, the meaning behind the title is \\"about taking all these things that make women the underdogs and using them to your advantage\\". Based on her novel, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, the album has been described as \\"an operatic feminist treatise set inside an insane asylum, wherein the female inmates gradually realize their own strength in numbers\\". On August 30, 2010, she announced that she would be undergoing jaw surgery, and recovered from it. In September 2011, she posted the full lyrics to the album's title track, \\"Fight Like a Girl\\", on her Twitter account. Autumn appeared at the 2011 Harvest Festival in Australia, and had planned to debut two songs from Fight Like a Girl during those performances. On April 11, 2012, Autumn released the single \\"Fight Like a Girl\\", with the song \\"Time for Tea\\" appearing as a B-side. On April 16, 2012, Autumn announced her plans to debut a three-hour musical adaptation of her autobiographical novel on London's West End theatre in 2014. According to her interview with Mulatschag, she has plans to play the roles of both protagonists, Emilie and Emily. Autumn also appeared in the twelve-minute teaser for Darren Lynn Bousman and Terrance Zdunich's project The Devil's Carnival, and for which she played the role of The Painted Doll. Bloody Crumpets members The Blessed Contessa and Captain Maggot also appear in the film as Woe-Maidens. On June 13, 2012, Emilie Autumn announced on her blog the release date of Fight Like a Girl, which was on July 24 of the same year and included a new addition; a song called \\"The Key\\". Autumn released an instrumental snippet of the song on a forum post, which is hidden in the last line of the lyrics, in which she posted. In 2014, it was announced that Autumn would be appearing at a handful of dates on the 2014 Vans Warped Tour with an installation called \\"The Asylum Experience\\", which will include music, burlesque, circus sideshow attractions and theater. On September 22, 2018, she released The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls: Behind the Musical, an album with songs made for her upcoming musical. Influences and musical style Autumn in Frankfurt, 2007 Her music encompasses a wide range of styles. Autumn's vocal range is contralto, but also has the ability to perform in the dramatic soprano range. Her vocal work has been compared to Tori Amos, Kate Bush, and The Creatures. She has released two instrumental albums (On a Day... and Laced/Unlaced), and four featuring her vocals: Enchant, Opheliac, A Bit o' This & That, and \\"Fight Like a Girl\\". The 2003 album Enchant drew on \\"new age chamber music, trip hop baroque, and experimental space pop\\". Autumn layers her voice frequently, and incorporates electronics and electronic effects into her work on Enchant; she also combines strings and piano for some songs, while others feature mainly the piano or violin. The 2006 release Opheliac featured \\"cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock & roll (and heavy on the theatrical bombast)\\". A classically trained musician, Autumn is influenced by plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. She enjoys the works of Shakespeare, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her husband Robert, and Edgar Allan Poe. She incorporates sounds resembling Victorian machinery such as locomotives, which she noted was \\"sort of a steampunk thing\\". While a young Autumn cited Itzhak Perlman as an influence because of the happiness she believed he felt when he played, her main musical influence and inspiration is the English violinist Nigel Kennedy. Her favorite singer is Morrissey from The Smiths. She takes inspiration for her songs from her life experiences and mixes in \\"layers and layers of references, connections, other stories and metaphors\\". Autumn describes her music and style as \\"Psychotic Vaudeville Burlesque\\". She alternatively labels her music and style as \\"Victoriandustrial'\\", a term she coined, and glam rock because of her use of glitter onstage. According to Autumn, her music \\"wasn't meant to be cutesy\\" and is labeled as \\"industrial\\" mainly because of her use of drums and yelling. Her adaption of \\"O Mistress Mine\\" was praised by author and theater director Barry Edelstein as \\"a ravishing, guaranteed tearjerker\\". For her live performances, which she calls dinner theatre because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque—\\"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things that were going on socially and politically\\"—to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self- mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex. Another crumpet, Captain Maggot, has taken a leave. Her wish for the live shows is to be an \\"anti-repression statement\\" and empowerment. Personal life She keeps a ritual of drawing a heart on her cheek as a symbol of protection. Autumn became vegetarian at age eleven after being unable to rationalize why she should eat farm animals but not her pet dog; in her late- teens, she became vegan. She believes that there is a link between the treatment of women and animals in society. In August 2014, Autumn said she had developed copper toxicity and was no longer vegan, although still a committed vegetarian. She has endorsed companies such as Manic Panic and Samson Tech. Autumn has bipolar disorder, which she has discussed in a number of interviews. =Novel= Autumn wrote a novel entitled The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, which was self-published in 2010. Because of the book's nature and possible autobiographical parts, she claimed its release was delayed because some did not want it published. The book incorporated anthropomorphized rats and leeches, and the diary of a fictional Victorian-era asylum inmate named \\"Emily\\". Autumn said one of the main messages was that many of the patients were not insane and that the subject of mental illness remains misunderstood.

The concept is old, but the particular phrase may have been coined by Lily Hardy Hammond in her 1916 book In the Garden of Delight. It was popularized by Science Fiction author Robert Heinlein, and then the phrase achieved significant fame from Catherine Ryan Hyde's 1999 novel (and then movie) Pay It Forward. \\"Pay it forward\\" is implemented in contract law of loans in the concept of third party beneficiaries. Specifically, the creditor offers the debtor the option of paying the debt forward by lending it to a third person instead of paying it back to the original creditor. This contract may include the provision that the debtor may repay the debt in kind, lending the same amount to a similarly disadvantaged party once they have the means, and under the same conditions. Debt and payments can be monetary or by good deeds. A related type of transaction, which starts with a gift instead of a loan, is alternative giving. History Paying forward was used as a key plot element in the denouement of a New Comedy play by Menander, Dyskolos (a title which can be translated as \\"The Grouch\\"). Dyskolos was a prizewinning play in ancient Athens in 317 BC; however, the text of the play was lost and it was only recovered and republished in 1957. The oldest, and perhaps most basic pattern of this concept, is the inter-generational devotion of parents to their children, re-enacting what their own parents did for them. In her 1916 book In the Garden of Delight, Lily Hardy Hammond reflects, \\"I never repaid Great-aunt Letitia's love to her, any more than she repaid her mother's. You don't pay love back; you pay it forward.\\" Regarding money, the concept was described by Benjamin Franklin, in a letter to Benjamin Webb dated April 25, 1784: Jesus, taught in Matthew 18:21-35. that paying it forward is a requirement for those who have received God's forgiveness. He told the parable of a man who had been forgiven a huge debt by the king, because the debtor had begged for mercy. However, after being freed from the debt, he found a fellow who owed him a very small debt, by comparison. Although, he had been shown a great mercy, he refused the same consideration to his fellow who had plead for more time to pay. When the king found this out, he was angry, and threw the original debtor into prison until he paid the entire debt. Jesus summarized the story by saying, \\"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his 1841 essay \\"Compensation\\",Ralph Waldo Emerson, \\"Compensation\\", 1841 (text of Emerson essay) wrote: \\"In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody.\\" Woody Hayes (1913 – 1987), winner of five national titles as football coach at The Ohio State University, misquoted Emerson as having said \\"You can pay back only seldom. You can always pay forward, and you must pay line for line, deed for deed, and cent for cent.\\" He also shortened the (mis)quotation into \\"You can never pay back; but you can always pay forward\\" and variants. The 1929 novel, Magnificent Obsession, by Lloyd C. Douglas, also espoused this philosophy, in combination with the concept that good deeds should be performed in confidence. An anonymous spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous said in The Christian Science Monitor in 1944, \\"You can't pay anyone back for what has happened to you, so you try to find someone you can pay forward.\\"\\"Group to Combat Alcoholism Grows Apace in Anonymity\\" The Christian Science Monitor, January 8, 1944; p. 3 Also in 1944, the first steps were taken in the development of what became the Heifer Project, one of whose core strategies is \\"Passing on the Gift\\". The mathematician Paul Erdős heard about a promising math student unable to enroll in Harvard University for financial reasons. Erdős contributed enough to allow the young man to register. Years later, the man offered to return the entire amount to Erdős, but Erdős insisted that the man rather find another student in his situation, and give the money to him. It is also possible for the original beneficiary to become part of the later chain of kindness. Some time in 1980, a sixteen-page supplemental Marvel comic appeared in the Chicago Tribune entitled “What Price a Life?” and was subsequently reprinted as the backup story in Marvel Team-Up #126 dated February 1983. This was a team-up between Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk, in which Spider-Man helps the Hulk escape from police who mistakenly thought that he was attacking them. Afterwards, they meet in their secret identities, with Peter Parker warning Bruce Banner to leave town because of the Hulk’s seeming attack on police. But Banner is flat broke, and cannot afford even bus fare. As a result, Parker gives Banner his last $5 bill, saying that someone had given him money when he was down on his luck, and this was how he was repaying that debt. Later, in Chicago, the Hulk confronts muggers who had just robbed an elderly retired man of his pension money, all the money he had. After corralling the muggers, the Hulk turns towards the victim. The retiree thinks that the Hulk is about to attack him as well, but instead, the Hulk gives him the $5 bill. It transpires that the very same old man had earlier given a down-on-his-luck Peter Parker a $5 bill. =Robert Heinlein's contribution= The term \\"pay it forward\\" was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his book Between Planets, published in 1951: Heinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy. Today, the Heinlein Society, a humanitarian organization founded in his name, practices it in the form of various programs such as blood drives, free educational CDs for teachers, and US$500 scholarships. Author Spider Robinson made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein. Heinlein was a mentor to a full generation of SF authors, including Ray Bradbury, giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury's novel Dandelion Wine, published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman: Bradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.  1999 novel, film and subsequent projects  In 1999, Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel Pay It Forward was published and then adapted in 2000 into a film of the same name, distributed by Warner Bros. and starring Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment. In Ryan Hyde's book and movie, it is described as an obligation to do three good deeds for others in response to a good deed that one receives. Such good deeds should accomplish things that the other person cannot accomplish on their own. In this way, the practice of helping one another can spread geometrically through society, at a ratio of three to one, creating a social movement with an impact of making the world a better place. The Pay it Forward Movement and Foundation was founded in the USA helping start a ripple effect of kindness acts around the world. The newly appointed president of the foundation, Charley Johnson, had an idea for encouraging kindness acts by having a Pay it Forward Bracelet that could be worn as a reminder. Since then, over a million Pay it Forward bracelets have been distributed in over 100 countries sparking acts of kindness. Few bracelets remain with their original recipients, however, as they circulate in the spirit of the reciprocal or generalized altruism. In 2007, International Pay It Forward DayPay It Forward Day was founded in Australia by Blake Beattie. It has now spread to 70 countries with over 50 state and city proclamations. It is estimated that it has inspired over five million acts of kindness and has featured on 7, 9, 10, ABC, NBC, Fox 5, Fox 8 and Global News in Canada. On April 5, 2012, WBRZ-TV, the American Broadcasting Company affiliate for the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, did a story on The Newton Project, a 501(c)(3) outreach organization created to demonstrate that regardless of how big the problems of the world may seem, each person can make a difference simply by taking the time to show love, appreciation and kindness to the people around them. It is based on the classic pay-it-forward concept, but demonstrates the impact of each act on the world by tracking each wristband with a unique ID number and quantifying the lives each has touched. The Newton Project’s attempt to quantify the benefits of a Pay It Forward type system can be viewed by the general public at their website. Inspired by John F. Kennedy who profoundly declared, \\"Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation\\", The Student Body of America Association, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, has initiated its Project Pay it Forward program to implement education with the pay-it-forward concept. Businesses have also adopted the concept as part of their corporate culture. Fargo, N.D.–based Bell Bank started a Pay It Forward program in 2007, inspired by Oprah Winfrey’s “Pay It Forward” project.The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, December 18, 2007 http://www.inforum.com/content/state-banks-pay-it-forward-initiative- receiving-worldwide-media-attention The program gives full-time employees $1,000 and part-time employees $500 each year to give to people and organizations in need.Bush Foundation http://bmag.bushfoundation.org/buzz/who- michael-solberg Employees are also given $1,000 to give to a customer, vendor or community member to donate to someone else.

These include Karma Kitchen, where patrons' meals have already been paid for by previous customers, and customers are then encouraged to contribute toward future patrons' meals. Heifer Project International pioneered the approach in sustainable development, and it has been utilized by microfinance lenders. Some authors advocate the pay it forward approach be utilized as the primary means of economic transaction. Such models have begun to be the topic of research.

It is slated to form the third stage in India's three-stage fuel-cycle plan. This phase of the fuel cycle plan is supposed to be built starting with a 300MWe prototype in 2016. construction has not started and a firm date has not be set. Background Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) set up a large infrastructure to facilitate the design and development of these Advanced Heavy Water reactors. Things to be included range from materials technologies, critical components, reactor physics, and safety analysis.Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. (2013). Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). Retrieved from http://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/Downloadable/aris/2013/AHWR.pdf Several facilities have been set up to experiment with these reactors. The AHWR is a pressure tube type of heavy water reactor. The Government of India, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), is fully funding the future development, the current development, and the design of the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor. The new version of Advanced Heavy Water Reactors will be equipped with more general safety requirements. India is the base for these reactors due to India's large Thorium reserves; therefore, it is more geared for continual use and operation of the AHWR. Motivation Thorium is three times more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium, though less abundant in terms of economically viable to extract reserves, with India holding the largest proven reserves of any country. Design The proposed design of the AHWR is that of a heavy- water-moderated nuclear power reactor that will be the next generation of the PHWR type. It is being developed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), in Mumbai, India and aims to meet the objectives of using thorium fuel cycles for commercial power generation. The AHWR is a vertical pressure tube type reactor cooled by boiling light water under natural circulation. A unique feature of this design is a large tank of water on top of the primary containment vessel, called the gravity-driven water pool (GDWP). This reservoir is designed to perform several passive safety functions. The overall design of the AHWR is to utilize large amounts of thorium and the thorium cycle. The AHWR is much like that of the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), in that they share similarities in the concept of the pressure tubes and calandria tubes, but the tubes' orientation in the AHWR is vertical, unlike that of the PHWR. The AHWR's core is 3.5 m long and has 513 lattice locations in a square pitch of 225 mm. The core is radially divided into three burn up regions. The burn up decreases as it moves toward the external surface of the core. Fuel is occupied by 452 lattice locations and the remaining 37 locations are occupied by shutdown system-1. This consists of 37 shut-off rods, 24 locations are for reactive control devices which are consisted of 8 absorber rods, 8 shim rods, and 8 regulating rods. By boiling light water at a pressure of 7 MPa, heat is then removed. The main focus with this model is to get the total power and a coarse spatial power distribution within the core to be within certain degree of accuracy. The reactor design incorporates advanced technologies, together with several proven positive features of Indian pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs). These features include pressure tube type design, low pressure moderator, on-power refueling, diverse fast acting shut-down systems, and availability of a large low temperature heat sink around the reactor core. The AHWR incorporates several passive safety features. These include: Core heat removal through natural circulation; direct injection of emergency core coolant system (ECCS) water in fuel; and the availability of a large inventory of borated water in overhead gravity-driven water pool (GDWP) to facilitate sustenance of core decay heat removal. The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) injection and containment cooling can act (SCRAM) without invoking any active systems or operator action. The reactor physics design is tuned to maximise the use of thorium based fuel, by achieving a slightly negative void coefficient. Fulfilling these requirements has been possible through the use of PuO2-ThO2 MOX, and ThO2-233UO2 MOX in different pins of the same fuel cluster, and the use of a heterogeneous moderator consisting of amorphous carbon (in the fuel bundles) and heavy water in 80–20% volume ratio. The core configuration lends itself to considerable flexibility and several feasible solutions, including those not requiring the use of amorphous carbon based reflectors, are possible without any changes in reactor structure. Some Distinctive Features of AHWR * Elimination of high-pressure heavy water coolant resulting in reduction of heavy water leakage losses, and eliminating heavy water recovery system. * Recovery of heat generated in the moderator for feed water heating. * Elimination of major components and equipment such as primary coolant pumps and drive motors, associated control and power supply equipment and corresponding saving of electrical power required to run these pumps. * Shop assembled coolant channels, with features to enable quick replacement of pressure tube alone, without affecting other installed channel components. * Replacement of steam generators by simpler steam drums. * Higher steam pressure than in PHWRs. * Production of 500 m3/day of demineralised water in Multi Effect Desalination Plant by using steam from LP Turbine. * Hundred year design life of the reactor. * A design objective of requiring no exclusion zone on account of its advanced safety features.http://dae.nic.in/writereaddata/.pdf_37 Fuel cycle The AHWR at standard is set to be a closed nuclear fuel cycle because this will lead to reduction in radio-toxicity. Because of this, the AHWR has alternate fuel options, given it has diverse fuel cycles. It can do closed types and once- through types of fuel cycles. The overall aspect of the AHWR is primed for high burn up with thorium-based fuel (BARC, 2013). Recycled thorium that is recovered from the reactor is then sent back, and plutonium is stored to be later used for a fast breeder reactor. The fuel for AHWR would be manufactured by ADVANCED FUEL FABRICATION FACILITY, which is under the direction of BARC Tarapur. AFFF is currently working on PFBR fuel rod production. AFFF has been associated with fuel rod fabrication for other research purposes in the past. AFFF is the only nuclear fuel production facility in the world which has dealt with Uranium, plutonium and thorium. Future plans Indian Government announced in 2013 it would build an AHWR of 300 MWe with its location to be decided.Establishment of Atomic Power Stations in the Country. Aug 2013 As of 2017, the design is in the final stages of validation. Safety innovation Past nuclear meltdowns such as Chernobyl and Fukushima have made the improvement of construction and maintenance of facilities to be crucial. These accidents were with the involvement of uranium-235 reactors and the poor structures of the facilities they were in. Since then, International Atomic nuclear Association has stepped up protocols in nuclear facilities in order to prevent these accidents from occurring again. One of the top security measures for a meltdown is containment of radioactivity from escaping the reactor. The Defense in Depth (DiD) is a method used in nuclear facilities to acquire the most effective practice of radioactive containment. The AWHR has acquired the Defense in Depth process which is used in reactors by providing a list of provisions and required equipment in order to retain the radioactivity in the core. The Defense in Depth method sets regulations that must be followed in order to reduce human error incidents and machine malfunctions. The procedures are the following: * Level 1: Prevention of abnormal operation and failure * Level 2: Control of abnormal operation and detection of failure * Level 3: Control of accidents within the design basis * Level 4: Control of severe plant conditions, including prevention of accident progression and mitigation of consequences of severe accidents * Level 5: Mitigation of radiological consequences of significant release of radioactive materials. The AWHR is an innovation in renewable energy safety as it will limit the use of fissile uranium-235 to breeding fissile uranium-233 from fertile thorium-232. The extraction of nuclear energy from the 90th element Thorium is said to have more energy than the world's oil, coal, and uranium combined. The AHWR has safety features that distinguish it from conventional lightwater nuclear reactors. Some of these features consist of: strong safety systems, reduction of heat from core through a built in cooling system, multiple shutdown systems and a fail-safe procedure that consist of a poison that shuts down the system in the case of a technical failure (FBR). The potential threat scientists try to avoid in reactors is the buildup of heat because nuclear energy escalates when it reacts with high temperatures, high pressures and chemical reactions. The AHWR has features that helps reduce the probability of this occurrence through: negative reactivity coefficients, low power density, low excess reactivity in the core and proper selection of material attributes built in.

Frank (1851–1908) was an American politician and businessman based in Montana. Frank was born in Ohio in 1851, and was of French descent. A self- made entrepreneur who invested in liquor distribution, real estate and mining, he also founded the Silver Bow Electric Light Company, was president of the Butte Water Company, and was the first chairman of the board of trustees of the Montana State School of Mines, a position held until his death. Henry Frank also co-owned (with Sam Gebo) the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company which operated a coal mine in the town of Frank, Alberta, Canada. He paid 30,000 for the property and the town was named after him. The mine owned by the company was damaged in the famous Frank Slide of 1903. Henry Frank was twice mayor of Butte, Montana (1885 - 1887) and a member of the first and second Montana state legislatures representing Silver Bow County. A Democrat, he was the 1896 chairman for the State Central Committee and was elected the presidential elector for Montana. He was nearly nominated for the US Senate in 1901 during a dramatic overnight debate (a clock was smashed so that nomination could be completed before a midnight deadline), eventually supporting Paris Gibson. Henry Frank achieved the 33rd degree of Freemasonry and in 1905 became grand master of the Grand Lodge of Montana, and was also active in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and Knights of Pythias lodges. Henry L. Frank died under uncertain circumstances in 1908 at age 57 while visiting his mother in Cincinnati, Ohio. There is some suggestion that depression or mental illness contributed to his death.

The campus is located at 1701 West Court Street in Paragould and is administered by Paragould School District. Oak Grove High School (mascot: Lions) and Paragould High School (mascot: Bulldogs) consolidated into Ridgecrest High School in 1986 and it was voted to change the nickname to the Rams to accommodate this consolidation. After the 1996–1997 school year, the school's name was changed back to Paragould High School but maintained the Rams as mascot.  Academics  The assumed course of study follows the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). Students complete regular (core and career focus) courses and exams and may select Advanced Placement (AP) coursework and exams that provide an opportunity for college credit. The school is accredited by the ADE and is a charter member and accredited by AdvancED (formerly North Central Association) since 1925.  Extracurricular activities  Paragould offers many extracurricular activities pertaining to athletics, drama, academic clubs, and band. The school's mascot is the Ram. The Paragould Rams compete in the Class 5A-East conference of the Arkansas Activities Association. Sports offered at Paragould High School include: football, basketball (boys/girls), soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, golf, tennis, swimming, and track & field. = Football = For years now, Paragould High and their cross-town rival, Greene County Tech, have competed with each other in nearly every sport. The most competitive and anticipated matchup is the yearly Paragould-Tech football games which occur once each school year. The teams used to play two games each season (one as an opener, one as a closer) but, Green County Tech moved up to the AAAAAA conference, and there is no longer a need for a second game. At the end of each season, Paragould and Green County Tech play each other for the coveted Bell Trophy. The winner of the game gets to take the bell home to their school. The Bell Trophy is a three-foot, bronze bell with small engraving plates on either side wood frame that tells the year in which it was won and by which school. In the '06-'07 school year, Paragould lost the bell to Tech on their own field, but on August 31, the first Paragould-Tech game of the new season was played at Paragould. The game ended with Paragould at 49 and Tech with 19. The Rams bullied past the Eagles by a score of 47–24. Paragould has won this trophy 8 times since its introduction in 1999. =Basketball= Paragould High has enjoyed success on the hardwood under direction of the legendary Coach Paynter. Paynter coached the Bulldogs/Rams for several decades and made many trips to the state tournament, with several semi-finals and finals appearances. Since the 2004 season, the Rams have not had a winning season and have averaged a meager 2 conference wins per year. Meanwhile, crosstown rival Greene County Tech has enjoyed 2 state titles and 3 finals appearances since 2006. In April 2009, Paragould hired alumnus, former player under Paynter, and most recently, head coach the Greene County Tech Junior High boys' basketball team, Jay Robertson. The girls' squad is coached by former Arkansas State assistant coach Jay Cook; Cook's first year was the 2008–09 season. In the 2010–11 season, both Coach Cook and Robertson coached their teams to the State tournament. The Sr. Lady Rams were conference champions, and the Sr. High Rams went after Forrest City High School beat out Nettleton High School for the top spot. =Band= The Paragould Pride Band has quickly grown to become of the district's crowning programs. In the 2014 marching season, the band took home 3 Grand Championships, 1 Reserve Grand Championship, 6 overall and class Drum Major Championships, 6 overall and class percussion Championships, and 1 class color guard Championships, as well as Class A Champions at BOA St. Louis, making the Pride the first Arkansas band to ever win Class A at a BOA event. Since 2008, the band has received 9 Overall Grand Championships and 7 Reserved Grand Championships. The band is also a 24 time recipient of the ASBOA Sweepstakes award, the highest honor given by ASBOA. During the 2014–15 school year, the band put a total of 15 students in all region Jazz Band, 33 students in Jr. High All Region, 47 students in Sr. High All Region, and 16 students in All- State Honors Bands; all including alternates. The Paragould Pride Band is a 4x Arkansas State Championin class 5A as of 2019.

The law was amended on 3 September 1971. The major force behind the law was the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights party, which had among its supporters - besides German citizens, who had fled or were expelled from formerly German territory annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union - many formerly non-citizens, who experienced by the end of World War II and the post-war years of ethnic cleansing, denaturalisation, robbing and humiliation (1945 until 1950) carried out by the governments of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Provisions The law applies to refugees and exiles (also known as expellees), which it defines as a German citizen or an ethnic German who resided in the former eastern territories of the German Reich, \\"located temporarily under foreign administration\\", or in areas outside the German Reich as at 31 December 1937, who as a result of the events of World War II suffered expulsion, in particular by removing or escape. Those expellees who were not already German nationals became entitled to German citizenship. The law did not apply to German nationals, including expellees and refugees from other countries, who at the time the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, were entitled to German citizenship under the 1913 nationality law and under Article 116 (2) of the Basic Law (federal constitution), but rather to ethnic Germans who only later managed to escape persecuting states and were entitled to German citizenship under the 1913 law. The law also contained a heredity clause entitling children of expellees to inherit German ethnicity and citizenship: \\"If one parent was a German citizen or ethnic German residing on December 31, 1937, or earlier, in the areas of exile...\\" Inheriting the status of \\"expelled\\" resulted in an increase in the number of persons covered by the Act. According to the statistical yearbook, in 1971 in West Germany there were 8.96 million \\"expellees\\" under the law, who could apply for a document certifying this classification (German: Bundesvertriebenenausweis; i.e. Federal Expellee Card). The law also recognises as refugees and expellees entitled to German citizenship refugees from Germany, who emigrated or were expelled after 30 January 1933 to flee factual or impending persecution on the grounds of their political opposition, their racial classification, their religion or philosophy of life (Weltanschauung). The persons entitled to German citizenship also include (former) foreign citizens of states of the Eastern Bloc, who themselves - or whose ancestors - were persecuted or discriminated between 1945 and 1990 for their German or alleged German ethnicity by their respective governments. The argument goes that the Federal Republic of Germany had/has to administer to the needs of these foreigners, because their respective governments in charge of guaranteeing their equal treatment as citizens, severely neglected or contravened that obligation.

Its flagship product contains aspirin and caffeine.http://www.insightpharma.com/product_details_AnacinRegular.cfm - History Anacin was invented by William Milton Knight and was first to be used circa 1916 as stated in the patent. Anacin is one of the oldest brands of pain relievers in the United States, first being sold in the 1930s. Anacin's mascot at the time was Ana Anacin, who was found in a number of ads for this product by Bayer. It was originally sold by the Anacin Co. (\\"Pharmaceutical Chemists\\") in Chicago, Illinois. American Home Products, now known as Wyeth, purchased the manufacturing rights in 1930. Anacin was reportedly their most popular product. Insight Pharmaceuticals acquired the brand in 2003. In 2014, Prestige Brands signed an agreement with Insight to acquire the company; it was Prestige Brand's largest acquisition to that point. Advertising In 1939, Anacin sponsored a daytime serial called Our Gal Sunday. Their sponsorship spanned 18 of the program's 23 years on the air. Early Anacin radio commercials appeared in radio shows and dramas of the 1940s and '50s. These \\"formulaic\\" commercials usually claimed that Anacin was being actively prescribed by doctors and dentists at the time, treated \\"headaches, neuritis and neuralgia\\", and that it contained \\"a combination of medically proven ingredients, like a doctor's prescription\\", without specifying those ingredients. Sometimes the announcer would mention that there were four active ingredients in Anacin, one of which was the medicine the consumer was already taking. It also claimed to help with depression. The announcer then reminded the listener that Anacin was available \\"at any drug counter\\", and \\"comes in handy (tin) boxes of 12 and 30, and economical family-size bottles of 50 and 100\\", usually spelling out its name at the end of the commercial. Anacin sponsored the first made-for-television sitcom, Mary Kay and Johnny. Unsure of how many viewers would be watching when they sponsored the show in 1947, Anacin ran a simple test, offering a free mirror to the first 200 viewers to write for one. The offer drew over 9,000 responses, overwhelming the sponsor but proving television was a viable advertising medium.Mitz, Rick. The Great TV Sitcom Book (Expanded Edition). New York, NY: Perigee Books - Putnam Publishing Co., 1983, p. 9. Print. Anacin was also a leading sponsor of the television soaps Love of Life, The Secret Storm and the early years of The Young and the Restless. Anacin is one of the earliest and best examples of a concerted television marketing campaign, created for them in the late 1950s by Rosser Reeves of the Ted Bates ad agency. Many people remember the commercials advertising \\"tension producing\\" situations, and the \\"hammers in the head\\" advertisement with the slogan \\"Tension. Pressure. Pain.\\" An Anacin advertisement in 1962 featured a mother trying to assist her grown daughter with various chores, such as preparing a meal. \\"Don't you think it needs a little salt?\\", the mother would say, only to have her nerve-racked daughter shout, \\"Mother, please, I'd rather do it myself!\\" As the mother wilted, the daughter would emote and rub her head, with her inner voice saying, \\"Control yourself! Sure, you've got a headache, you're tense, irritable, but don't take it out on her!\\" Another commercial had a wife greeting her husband as he pulled into their driveway in his car; the husband responded by yelling \\"Helen, can't you keep Billy's bike out of the driveway?!?\\" These advertisement scenarios became popular and were parodied a number of times, including in the Allan Sherman song \\"Headaches\\", the 1966 film The Silencers and the 1980 film Airplane. The medication was mentioned in the book \\"The Shinning\\" by Stephen king. Anacin had a large advertisement behind the center field fence of Yankee Stadium from the 1950s through 1973, until the stadium's 1974-75 renovation. Products Anacin covers a family of pain relievers. There are currently two different formulations: *Anacin Regular Strength - contains 400 mg ASA (aspirin) and 32 mg caffeine per tablet. *Anacin Max Strength - contains 500 mg ASA and 32 mg caffeine per tablet. Side effects Anacin's side effects may include dizziness, heartburn, irritability, nausea, nervousness, rashes, hives, bloody stools, drowsiness, hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and trouble sleeping.

He played as a right-handed batsman and a round arm slow right arm bowler for Oxford University (1861–1865), a Middlesex XI (1862), Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1862–1878) and Middlesex County Cricket Club (1864–1877). After graduating from Oxford (where he was at Brasenose College) in 1865, he studied law at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1871. He succeeded his brother Edward as President of Middlesex and served in this role from 1907 until his death at Regent's Park, aged 80.

He is best known as the lead singer and bodhrán player of Irish folk group, The Chieftains. He joined the group in 1976 after contributing to their album The Chieftains 6: Bonaparte's Retreat. Conneff was born in Donore, a village near Drogheda, in County Louth, Ireland and raised in the Liberties, in the heart of Dublin. Music was an important part of his home life but, as he later related, \\"I didn't hear traditional music from the womb,\\" as did other members of the Chieftains. It was not until he began work as a photographic assistant for a printing machine company, at age 18, that he was introduced to Irish traditional music. A group of his work colleagues would hire a car every week to drive to local fleadhs (traditional Irish music festivals). Conneff began attending weekend jam sessions, occasionally joining the musicians for some songs. He was heavily influenced by the traditional style of singing from the Donegal/Fermanagh region in Ireland, particularly the singing of Paddy Tunney. Around this time, he took up the bodhrán after hearing one on the radio, including the playing of Sean O Riada with Ceoltóirí Chualann, and was amazed at the power of the simple goatskin Irish frame drum. Conneff soon mastered the bodhrán and began playing and singing at sessions about Ireland, along with playing with Dublin traditional music circles. For many years, he helped run the Tradition Club, a haven for traditional musicians, including future Chieftains colleagues Paddy Moloney, Seán Keane and Michael Tubridy. In the early 1970s, he joined Christy Moore for what became a benchmark album, Prosperous. Prior to joining the Chieftains, he maintained his printing job, also looking after his elderly mother. Conneff has three children, Peigí, Ruairí and Ella and lives in Wicklow.

He was perhaps best known for his work in Punch magazine (of which he served as editor from 1949 to 1953) and his World War II warning propaganda posters; \\"Careless talk costs lives\\" was one of the most popular. He also designed many posters for the London Underground. Early life Bird was born in London on 17 December 1887, the son of Arthur Bird, a company director. He was educated at Cheltenham College and King's College London (B.Sc). While at King's College he attended evening art classes at the Regent Street Polytechnic and at the School of Photo-Engraving in Bolt Court. He was seriously injured at the Battle of Gallipoli during World War I and invalided out of the British Army. Career Bird first contributed to Punch in 1916, while convalescing, and also contributed to several other British newspapers and magazines, including the Graphic and Tatler. His pen name was based on the fougasse, a type of mine. As one of the best known cartoonists of the time, he was one of 170 authors who created doll-sized books exclusively for Queen Mary's Dolls' House; his illustrated verse tale, written on postage stamp- sized pages, was published as a regular-sized hardback in 2012 by the Royal Collection and Walker Books.Alison Flood, \\"Miniature fairytale for royal dolls' house to be published full size\\", The Guardian, 18 April 2012. In the course of the 1920s and 1930s, his drawings evolved from the traditionally representational to an innovative, spare, style that was both unique and popular, featuring in many advertising campaigns as well as in magazine editorial. He became art editor of Punch from 1937 to 1949, then editorMichael Maslin, New Yorker Cartoonists, A-Z Retrieved October 10, 2014 until 1953. He was the only cartoonist ever to edit the magazine. During World War II, he worked unpaid for the Ministry of Information, designing humorous but effective propaganda posters including the famous \\"Careless Talk Costs Lives\\" series. For this work he was awarded the honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1946. He illustrated and co-wrote several humorous books with W. D. H. McCullough. These included the very successful Aces Made Easy – or Pons asinorum in a nutshell, on the subject of contract bridge, in 1934, and You Have Been Warned – A Complete Guide to the Road, in 1935. In the mid-1950s, he taught at the Christian Science Sunday School in the Sloane Square church, which has since been converted into the Cadogan Hall concert hall.John Paul Morrison Biography He died in London, aged 77. Legacy Since 2009 his cartoon of a butler carrying a tray has been used to illustrate the front page of British Airways' First Class menus, continuing an association with the airline which goes back to the 1930s when Fougasse penned advertising posters for BA's forerunner, Imperial Airways.

Featuring lesbian and bisexual women characters, the strip stars Jane Wyatt, a young lesbian living in a trailer in Northern California with her straight male roommate, Ethan, and follows her life with her circle of friends, romances, and exes. Shortly after celebrating its 20th anniversary, publication ended with Jane marrying Dorothy. The comic strip is notable for being the first gay-themed comic work to receive online distribution by a national newspaper syndicate in the United States. Jane's World was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2006. Comic strip Braddock created Jane's World so that women, particularly lesbians, would have a comic strip character that they could relate to, though it's meant to be accessible to a wider audience. Braddock devised Jane in 1991 but never actually put her onto paper until 1998, and began publishing on the Internet in late March. In 2001, United Media's Comics.com website picked up reprints of Jane's World, making it the first gay-themed work to receive distribution by a national media syndicate. In April 2002, it was picked up for print syndication by United Media's United Feature Syndicate. They began publishing new works in 2007. In addition to web and newspaper publication, Braddock published the strip in a comic book format through her own publication house, \\"Girl Twirl Comics\\". The trade paperback versions feature covers created by different artists. Characters Several characters in Jane's World. From left to right: Jill, Ethan, Chelle, Jane, Dorothy, Dorrie, and Archie. Jane's World characters are all friends, to various degrees, and romantic interests of Jane; along with the occasional ex- girlfriend, coworker, and boss in the mix. =Jane= The protagonist of Jane’s World is Jane Wyatt. Her middle name, Tiberius, was given by her dad, a Star Trek fan. She is a white, soft butch, lesbian, who is in and out of jobs, in and out of housing, in and out of comical blunders and cosmic dimensions, and in and out of relationships. Jane has run-ins with exes as well as the Log Cabin Republicans, The Star League of The Last Starfighter, Amazon Island, zombies, to name a few. =Rusty= Jane's mixed-breed dog. He has a brown ring around his left eye. The comic strip begins with a Rusty storyline that introduces Jane and her circle of friends and family. =Dorothy= Jane's best friend, and on-again, off-again girlfriend. Dorothy runs the coffee shop, Hard Drive Cafe, where many of the comic strip's plots take place. Unbeknownst to either of them, their mothers tried to play matchmakers and arranged for Jane and Dorothy to get together one evening. Things heated up between them but Jane became confused after Skye showed her some interest. The comic strip concludes with Jane and Dorothy getting married. =Ethan= Jane's straight male roommate and best dude. Their romantic relationships with women often get in the way of their friendship. Ethan has a gay brother named, Julian. =Chelle= Chelle is visually reminiscent of Trinity in The Matrix. She rides a motorcycle, has a special ops background, and a past she is trying to get away from. Despite her coolness, Chelle dates Jane, and remains a good friend post breakup. =Dorrie= Jane's co-worker at The Daily News and friend. Dorrie is African American, a lesbian, and has a crush on Chelle. =Archie= Jane's co-worker at The Daily News and friend. Archie is Asian American, straight, and is not amused by Jane's antics at work or in her relationships. =Skye= One of Jane's love interests who works at The Garden of Vegan diner. She unsuccessfully tries to get Jane to eat healthier while they're dating. She's also a surfer. =Jill= Chelle's on-again, off-again girlfriend. She was Chelle's former partner on the police force, and prior to that, a United States Navy diver. She is often portrayed as Jane's nemesis. Jill never has a problem attracting women. =Talia= An ex-girlfriend of Jane's that pops in and out of the strip. She's bisexual and went to college with Jane. =Bud= Jane's laid-back cousin and car mechanic. =Shallow Breast Guy = Based on cartoonist Stephan Pastis, creator of Pearls Before Swine, this character appears only occasionally as a breast-obsessed, straight male. Shallow Breast Guy is drawn to look like Pastis. He once took control of the strip and drew Jane's World in the style of Pearls Before Swine, endowing the women with large breasts and portraying them as hyper-sexualized, thereby earning his nickname. In turn, Pastis has featured Braddock's wiener dog Andy (and, less frequently, Olive) in his strip.

Built in 1903, it is one of the oldest original Chinese temples in Australasia. It is also known as Hou Wang Miau, Atherton Joss House and Atherton Chinese Temple. It is one of only two or three temples outside China known to be dedicated to Hou Wang and is the only surviving timber and iron temple in Queensland. The temple contains a substantial number of original artifacts. Most were made in China during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially for this temple. They include a clapperless bell manufactured about 1895 and numerous intricately carved timber panels. It was once the socio-religious focus for over 1,000 Chinese residents who worked as timber cutters, market gardeners and maize growers. The temple and the land it stands on was purchased by a group of Chinese families, who donated it to the National Trust of Queensland. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The temple's restoration was completed on 15 September 2002, and it now includes an art gallery and interpretation centre. The temple and gallery are open to the public six days a week, (closed Mondays).  History  The Atherton Chinese Temple was built in 1903 by the community of the Chinatown at Atherton using local materials for construction and furnishings ordered especially from China. It provided a social and spiritual focus for over a thousand people in the township and the surrounding area. Atherton Chinatown was one of many small settlements that developed in Australia during the nineteenth century as homes for the Chinese sojourners who arrived in great numbers to work on the goldfields. Most of these Chinese were males who came from poor areas in south west China and intended to work here until they had gathered enough capital to assure their financial security on their return home. For mutual support and to maintain contacts with their homeland, they lived and worked together, creating such Chinatowns within European settlements, or on their fringes. Chinese diggers flocked to north Queensland in the 1870s in large numbers following the discovery of gold on the Palmer River and on the Hodgkinson. They were regarded with suspicion and hostility by Europeans, who they greatly outnumbered, and were barred from working on newly discovered mineral fields. Because of this, and as the Palmer River field was faded in importance, most Chinese moved south looking for other means to make a living. They arrived in the Atherton area in the early 1880s, working with European timber getters, and set up a camp on the opposite side of Piebald Creek to the tiny European settlement of Prior's Pocket. In 1885, this area was surveyed and officially named Atherton. Land sales took place and although the Chinese were not allowed to own land, many entered into leases with Europeans and began farming. They grew fruit and vegetables to supply nearby towns and pioneered the growing of maize in north Queensland, which became an important commercial crop. Chinatown grew to service Chinese people in and around Atherton and by 1897 was a thriving residential and commercial centre. In the 1890s, it was decided to built a temple to serve what was now quite a large community. Funds were collected and furnishings were ordered from China. In 1903, the temple was constructed of local cedar and black bean timber and corrugated iron. Brick was the material usually chosen for temples in Australia and the painting of the front wall to resemble this material suggests that the community would have preferred brick, had it been readily available. The temple complex consisted of a temple dedicated to the god Hou Wang, a feasting hall, kitchen and store. It had living quarters for a caretaker and provided accommodation for those visiting the temple from the outlying district. During the 1900s, when Chinatown was at the height of its importance, the temple was a social and spiritual centre for over a thousand people. Following the First World War, Chinese leases on agricultural land in the district were revoked in favour of soldier settlers. During the nineteen twenties, most of the inhabitants of Chinatown and the surrounding farms moved south or to nearby coastal towns. Many of the buildings in Chinatown were demolished and removed, some being reused locally. A caretaker remained at the temple which was used by a few old men who remained in the township. Although some repairs were carried out, without a community to support it, the temple fell into disrepair. A cyclone in 1956 blew away the pagoda, which was replaced by a lean-to. Damage also occurred from water leakage. In the 1960s artefacts were removed from the temple, including the image of Hou Wang and other gods. Some of these artefacts have since been returned. The temple was used intermittently for worship until the early 1970s and contains objects connected with this later use. The land on which the temple stands was purchased in 1965 by several local Chinese families. In 1975, the National Trust of Queensland, who had been aware of the temple for some time, gained funding to begin investigative work. In 1977 the area was surveyed, as the Fong On family had offered the temple to the Trust to ensure its preservation. At about the same time cataloging of the remaining artefacts in the temple began. The temple was transferred to the Trust in 1980 and conservation work on the buildings began. It is now interpreted as a place museum.  Description  Interior of the Joss House in Atherton, 1929 The temple complex is situated in an open, grassed area which is the site of the former Chinatown. Its positioning suggests that geomancy was used to select the most auspicious site and alignment for the buildings. The complex consists of a temple, hall, kitchen and store constructed of corrugated iron and local timbers in a traditional Chinese form. The buildings are marked off from the street by an ornamental picket fence and gate which have been reconstructed from photographs and archaeological investigation. The temple building is fronted by a pagoda consisting of the upper section of the original roof mounted on a new base. Inside, the space is divided into an entrance area separated by doors from the area which contains the altar and a heavenly well. This is a section of raised pagoda roof which is designed to admit light and to allow incense to rise from the large burner below. It is glazed to keep out rain and is supported on posts which display a deliberate irregularity to symbolize human imperfection. The interior of the temple is lined with unpainted cedar and is decorated with carvings, painted metal wall panels and temple furnishings which were imported from China. Much of the carving is embellished with vermilion and gold paint. On the left side of the building as one faces the altar, a door provides access to the adjacent community hall. This is a plainer, more functional building and contains a bedroom for the caretaker, and a room for meetings and ceremonial banquets. There is a clerestory similar to the one in the temple and evidence of Chinese notices and graffiti survive on the unpainted walls. Behind the hall are two small buildings which contained a store and kitchen. Both are timber framed and clad, unpainted inside with earth floors. The kitchen has a galvanised fire recess. Much of these two buildings has been reconstructed. The buildings are raised on hardwood stumps. Structural members are made of black bean (Castanospermum australe) and the ceilings, wall linings and joinery are made from red cedar (Toona australis). Red Penda and Kalantis have been substituted for these no longer common timbers where reconstruction work was necessary for conservation. Both of these timbers are very close to the original in appearance. Paths edged with upturned bottles, an indentation which indicates the position of the pig roasting pit and archaeological remains survive. Artefacts which were placed in temporary storage are being replaced in the temple as they are conserved. These include carvings, carved banners and the temple bell on its stand. There are also substantial archaeological collections.

It is capable of handling many corrosive chemicals as well as solvents and gases. It is characterized by a single piston that reciprocates within a magnetic field and therefore doesn’t require a dynamic seal to link the piston to an outside mechanical power source. Check valves are placed at both ends of the piston housing allowing the simultaneous suctioning and pumping that reverses with each stroke. This is known to reduce pulsations especially at higher flow rates. The piston and housing are constructed of materials that are inert to many liquids and gasses. Because the piston and housing are non-plastic materials the positive displacement chamber does not change in dimension from flexing and distortion thus allowing inductive pumps to remain very accurate with no significant changes over time. Inductive pumps are extremely accurate as each stroke contains the same volume created by a solid piston inside a solid chamber. The number of strokes can be counted or timed to determine the total volume delivered. They can be used in sterile and controlled environments as they will not leak to the outside of the housing even if the piston has experienced wear. Efficiency Inductive pumps are considered highly accurate and energy efficient. Inductive pumps use two primary parameters to control flow, they are Rate and Dwell. Rate is used to determine the number of strokes per second or in any given time interval. Dwell is used to control the length of time the energizing coil remains on during the Rate cycle. Essentially if the piston has completed its stroke and is waiting for the reverse cycle to occur, there is no need to continue energizing the coil as most of this energy will be converted to heat as no more work is being done by the piston. The Dwell setting allows adjustment of this ON time during the rate cycle. Also the Dwell setting allows for a true pressure control parameter for the pump. By reducing the Dwell time even further one can reduce the total energy applied to the piston during the pumping cycle. This can reduce the maximum output pressure during pumping. This differs from many other pumps as they commonly reduce flow to reduce pressure in a given circumstance, however if an occlusion occurs to the output channel other pumps tend to build up to their maximum pressure until they either burst the tubing or damage their internal mechanism. Inductive pumps can be shut off at the outlet and will not exceed the pressure they are set at. Pumping against a closed output does not cause damage to the pump. History The Inductive Pump was first patented in the United States by Laurence R. Salamey in 1998 U.S. patent number 5 713 728 and again in 1999 U.S. patent number 5 899 672. An additional patent has been filed for in 2014 by Salamey. The pump was originally designed as an improvement to peristaltic and diaphragm pumps as they were susceptible to fracturing of the pumping chamber with use due to their flexing of plastic parts. Inductive pumps were found to be an improvement to accuracy and length of service before repairs were required. Over time Salamey continued to develop his understanding of magnetic fields and their use for propagation of force with the inductive pump. This has led to further refinements and increased efficiency. Additionally inductive pumps have developed the ability to achieve much higher pressures in excess of 3,000 psi. The same inductive pump technology can be applied to very small pumps delivering volumes in the micro-liter range to much larger pumps delivering volumes in the 10 gallon per minute range. Understanding of magnetic field propagation has led to increased design simplicity which is a hallmark of inductive pumps. There are very few moving parts and no mechanical linkages. The piston is the only moving part aside from the check valves and it is driven by an electrically controlled magnetic field. Applications Inductive pumps have been used in many different applications such as the following: # Industrial chemical feed systems # Water Treatment chemical injection process # Oil bearing lubrication of industrial pump and motor bearings (Block and Budris, 2004) # Automotive pumping systems i.e. fuel pumps, vacuum pumps, exhaust treatment pumps etc. # Micro-liter disbursement of flavoring in food manufacturing # High Pressure injection of chemicals into oil and gas transfer lines # Industrial waste water treatment before discharge # Industrial laundry chemical feed systems # Sub-oceanic in situ mass spectroscopy environmental testing # Environmental sampling and chemical treatment dosing Important design characteristics Inductive pumps use both sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that both sides of the pump piston are always experiencing the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a closed circuit, at the beginning of a stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leak to the outside of the system. Additionally inductive pumps may also be connected in series to approximately double the pressure while not increasing the volume. They may also be connected in parallel to approximately double the volume while not increasing the pressure. Most positive displacement pumps cannot increase output pressure when placed in series as they both stop when they reach their max operating pressure. The inductive pumps add to each other due to the zero differential seen on the second pump from the first pump. Technology The fundamental basis for induced voltage in a magnetic field comes from Faraday's law describing an induced electromotive force (EMF) as follows: Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t) (Nave, C. R. 2011). This implies that as the number of magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent change in induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in the Lorentz Force Law as: F = qE + qv x B. Here, all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave a specially oriented direction to each of the forces, allowing prediction of the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes, in his second patent, the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located at either end of the piston bore. The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the magnetic piston body causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end- pole (Salamey, 1999). Efficiencies Inductive pumps are designed for increased efficiency and were intended to reduce energy consumption in an environment that is increasingly demanding energy conservation. Most electric motors are, on average, about 85% efficient as evidenced by the usual stall test that shows a marked increase in current draw when the motor is stopped mechanically. Inductive pumps show no increase in current draw when stalled during operation as better than 95% of the current is being used to create a force on the piston. There are very few mechanical losses compared to conventional piston pumps and other technologies because there are no mechanical linkages between the piston and outside power sources. The inductive pump piston is driven directly by the magnetic field formed within the body structure about the bore and within the piston. There are minimal friction losses between the piston and bore due to a circumferential magnetic field that pulls the piston equally in all directions towards the wall of the bore. The resulting force is more axial along the path of the piston creating output pressure. Most other pumps use different types of gear reduction mechanisms to slow the motor rotation when driving the piston. These linkages result in significant energy losses in addition to the inefficiencies of the motor. Inductive pumps use various proprietary coatings to reduce friction drag and increase efficiency.

Siegel in 1982. The company first expanded from Central Florida to Miami and Daytona Beach. Today, Westgate has 29 locations across the United States. History Founded in 1982, Westgate Resorts operates as a subsidiary of Central Florida Investments, Inc. (CFI), which employs over 10,000 people and has evolved into the largest privately held corporation in the Central Florida area. Siegel opened CFI, a real estate development firm, with an office located in his family garage in 1970. The Westgate family of resorts was born in 1982 with the opening of a 16-unit resort at Westgate Vacation Villas. Westgate Lakes Resort & Spa opened in 1996, followed by Westgate Towers in 1997; Westgate Town Center and Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort & Spa in 1999; Westgate Flamingo Bay in 2001; Westgate Blue Tree Resort, Westgate Park City Resort & Spa and Westgate River Ranch in 2002; and Westgate Palace and Westgate Historic Williamsburg in 2003. Westgate Resorts now encompasses more than 13,500 villas at 28 full-service resorts. Siegel was recognized as a CEO of the Year honoree by the Orlando Business Journal in 2014. In 2016 Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort suffered extensive damage from a fire, rebuilding is said to have begun quickly. In May 2018, musician Barry Manilow returned to Las Vegas as the exclusive headliner at the Westgate International Theater at Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. In June 2018, Westgate acquired the former Hilton New York Grand Central, a 23-floor, 300-room, two-tower hotel located in the historic Tudor City neighborhood within Midtown Manhattan's East Side that has been rebranded Westgate New York City. Philanthropy Westgate Resorts operates the Westgate Resorts Foundation, which was started in 2001, and gives out more than $2 million annually to charities and causes in communities where Westgate Resorts employees live and work. The Westgate CareForce provides volunteer help not only for Westgate Resorts Foundation projects, but also to support the programs and events of charities in the local community. More than 50,000 hours of volunteer time have been given by members of the Westgate CareForce in support of charities located in our resort communities. Also founded by the Westgate Resorts Foundation, Hospitality Helps is a private-public collaborative effort that helps Central Florida families transition out of incidental homelessness by providing sustainable housing, employment, incidental items and case management or follow-up to ensure that the families making the transition are taking adequate strides toward independence. In addition, for five consecutive years, Westgate Resorts has given away free vacations to military families each November. In 2015, Westgate gave 3,500 free vacations to U.S. military veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and The War on Terror.  Program  In 2020, Westgate Resorts unveiled their new, all- encompassing WestgateCARES system. The initiative provides a guide for how the organization can reopen its services safely with detailed procedures that meet, and in most cases exceed, the guidelines imposed by the government. The Queen of Versailles In 2012, filmmaker Lauren Greenfield released a documentary entitled The Queen of Versailles, based on a series of interviews with Siegel, his wife Jackie Siegel, and their attempt to build a 90,000 square foot mansion, Versailles house, modeled after the famous French original. In the film, David Siegel is shown struggling (and ultimately failing) to secure funding for Westgate's Las Vegas high-rise resort, the PH Towers Westgate. Siegel's son and senior Westgate executive, Richard, is quoted as saying that David Siegel's determination not to lose the PH Tower was a major source of the company's financial troubles in 2009-11. On November 22, 2011, a controlling interest in the property was sold to Resort Finance America LLC. Lawsuits =Legal dispute with building contractor= Westgate Resorts was sued in a federal court in Las Vegas for failure to pay bills relating to the pH Towers and building work allegedly carried out to a poor standard. On February 27, 2013, Clark County District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez ordered Westgate Resorts to pay the plaintiff, Tutor-Saliba Corp., $9 million in unpaid bills, and awarded $2.6m to Westgate for various shoddy building works including a cracked concrete swimming pool. =Class action lawsuit= Westgate Resorts was sued by 300 former sales employees in 2010 for unpaid sales commissions. They won the lawsuit and Westgate Resorts were ordered to pay $600,000. Despite paying $50,000 initially, Westgate stopped payment and the matter went back to the courts for another three years. The matter was finally settled under Judge Michael Baxley, and Westgate agreed to pay $500,000, $100,000 less than the original judgement required. In January 2014, Westgate Resorts filed dozens of new lawsuits against many of its former employees who were involved with this class action lawsuit, claiming that it deserves to recover previously paid sales commissions. According to the Orlando Sentinel, many of those included in these new lawsuits feel that these new legal actions are \\"...retaliation for the award granted to the defendant in a class action lawsuit,\\" and one of the lawyers representing the former Westgate employees is quoted as saying that the action is \\"unconscionable\\". =United States of America versus Westgate Resorts Ltd= On January 20, 2009, Westgate Resorts Ltd. was found guilty and had to settle with the US Government for its violations of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (\\"Rule\\"), 16 C.F.R. Part 310, including the National Do Not Call Registry provisions. As part of its settlement with the US Government, it had to pay a $900,000 fine. =Sexual harassment lawsuit= In 2004, Central Florida Investments and David Siegel were sued by former Westgate employee Dawn Myers. In 2008, they were found liable for battery after a trial in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The jury awarded $5,378,863.14 but the judge reduced the award to $610,469.84: $103,622.09 in compensatory damages and $506,847.75 in punitive damages. This award arose from Myers's claim of battery under state law, but her claims of sexual harassment were found to be time-barred. In January 2010, The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed an appeal and cross-appeal, affirming the district court's verdict. =Lawsuit against the Sundance Institute and the filmmakers of The Queen of Versailles= On January 10, 2012, David Siegel and Westgate Resorts, Ltd filed a lawsuit in Florida against the Sundance Institute and the filmmakers of The Queen of Versailles, claiming that Sundance's published film description was defamatory. On January 23, 2013, the United States District Court Judge Conway of the Middle District of Florida, ordered a stay of the lawsuit pending arbitration. In her order, Judge Conway called the testimony previously offered by Mr. Siegel during court hearings, \\"inconsistent and incredible and thus lacking weight\\". The matter was subsequently heard before an arbitrator for the Independent Film & Television Alliance (IFTA) in June 2013. On March 13, 2014, the arbitrator awarded in favor of the filmmakers, Lauren Greenfield and Frank Evers, including an order that David Siegel and Westgate Resort pay $750,000 to the filmmakers. The arbitrator wrote in the award, \\"Having viewed the supposedly egregious portions of the Motion Picture numerous times, [the Arbitrator] simply does not find that any of the content of the Motion Picture was false.\\" The arbitrator also wrote that Westgate had failed to show how it was damaged from the documentary. Finally, the arbitrator wrote that Westgate \\"did not remotely establish the type of malice required for a defamation claim on behalf of a public figure.\\" Political controversy CEO David Siegel, a Republican, sent an email in the fall of 2012 to all of his employees suggesting that he might \\"reduce the size of this company\\" if Obama were to win the 2012 presidential election. The email was widely interpreted by the media as a threat to the employees about possible layoffs if Barack Obama were to be re-elected. Siegel admitted in the documentary The Queen of Versailles as to possibly illegal activities in Florida during the 2000 United States elections, which he claims were singularly responsible for getting George W. Bush into the White House. In an August 2012 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Siegel elaborated on his claims: See also References External links Timeshare Division *Westgate Events *Westgate Owner Rewards Real estate companies of the United States Companies based in Orlando, Florida Siegel family Timeshare chains Real estate companies established in 1982 Hospitality companies established in 1982 American companies established in 1982 1982 establishments in Florida 1982 establishments in the United States Companies established in 1982 ","title":"Westgate Resorts"},{"id":"4028737","text":"Computer Lib/Dream Machines is a 1974 book by Ted Nelson, printed as a two- front-cover paperback to indicate its \\"intertwingled\\" nature. Originally self- published by Nelson, it was republished with a foreword by Stewart Brand in 1987 by Microsoft Press. In Steven Levy's book Hackers, Computer Lib is described as \\"the epic of the computer revolution, the bible of the hacker dream. [Nelson] was stubborn enough to publish it when no one else seemed to think it was a good idea.\\" Published just before the release of the Altair 8800 kit, Computer Lib is often considered the first book about the personal computer.  Background  Prior to the initial release of Computer Lib/Dream Machines, Nelson was working on the first hypertext project, Project Xanadu, founded in 1960. An integral part to the Xanadu vision was computing technology and the freedom he believed came with it. These ideas were later compiled and elaborated upon in the 1974 text, around the time when locally networked computers had appeared and Nelson found global networks as a space for the hypertext system. Synopsis = Computer Lib = In Computer Lib. You can and must understand computers NOW, Nelson covers both the technical and political aspects of computers. Nelson attempts to explain computers to the laymen during a time when personal computers had not yet become mainstream and anticipated the machine being open for anyone to use. Nelson writes about the need for people to understand computers more deeply than was generally promoted as computer literacy, which he considers a superficial kind of familiarity with particular hardware and software. His rallying cry \\"Down with Cybercrud\\" is against the centralization of computers such as that performed by IBM at the time, as well as against what he sees as the intentional untruths that \\"computer people\\" tell to non-computer people to keep them from understanding computers. = Dream Machines = Dream Machines. New Freedom through Computer Screens- a Minority Report, is the opposite of the Computer Lib side. Nelson explores what he believes is the future of computers and the alternative uses for them. This side was his counterculture approach to how computers had typically been used. Nelson covers the flexible media potential of the computer, which was shockingly new at the time. He saw the use of hypermedia and hypertext, both terms he coined, being beneficial for creativity and education. He urged readers to look at the computer not as just a scientific machine, but as an interactive machine that can be accessible to anyone. In this section, Nelson also described the details of Project Xanadu. He proposed the idea of a future Xanadu Network, where users could shop at Xanadu stands and access material from global storage systems.  Format  Both the 1974 and 1987 editions have an unconventional layout, with two front covers. The Computer Lib cover features a raised fist in a computer. Once flipped over, the Dream Machines cover shows a man with a cape flying with a finger pointed to a screen. The division between the two sides is marked by text (for the other side) rotated 180°. The book was stylistically influenced by Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog. The text itself is broken up into many sections, with simulated pull-quotes, comics, sidebars, etc., similar to a magazine layout. According to Steven Levy, Nelson's format requirements for the book's \\"over-sized pages loaded with print so small you could hardly read it, along with scribbled notations, and manically amateurish drawings\\" may have contributed to the difficulty of finding a publisher for the first edition - Nelson paid 2,000 dollars out of his own pocket for the first print run of several hundred copies. Besides the Whole Earth Catalog, the layout also bore similarities to the People's Computer Company (PCC) newsletter, published by a Menlo Park based group of the same name, where Nelson's book would gain (as described by Levy) \\"a cult following ... Ted Nelson was treated like royalty at [PCC] potluck dinners.\\" Neologisms In Computer Lib, Nelson introduced a few words that he coined : * Cybercrud: \\"the author's own term for the practice of putting things over on people using computers (especially, forcing them to adapt to a rigid, inflexible, poorly thought out system)\\". In the text, Nelson puts forth the rallying cry \\"Down with Cybercrud!\\" * Hypertext: originally coined in 1965, is text displayed which references other information that a user can access. Nelson explores the types of the term and its future in computers greatly within Computer Lib. Some include: **Chunk style consists of 'chunks' of separate text or media connected by links. **Stretch text is text that extends itself. Instead of linking, it zooms in depending on the detail needed. * Intertwingularity: Nelson says \\"Everything is deeply intertwingled\\". He says that all subjects and information are connected. The term comes from the merging of intertwined and intermingled. * Fantics: \\"the art and science of getting ideas across, both emotionally and cognitively\\". Nelson explains this as the audience receiving feelings while also receiving information from content.  Legacy  After its release, it drew an underground following from media theorists to computer hackers. In his book Tools for Thought, Howard Rheingold calls Computer Lib \\"the best-selling underground manifesto of the microcomputer revolution.\\" It has since been referred to as \\"the most influential book in the history of computational media\\", as well as \\"the most important book in the history of new media\\" in The New Media Reader. One of the most widely adopted ideas from Computer Lib was Ted Nelson's \\"chunk-style\\" hypertext. This type of hypertext is used in most websites today. As the book came out before the first personal computer and its rise in popularity, Nelson has been credited with predicting how we interact with computers in terms of arts and entertainment, like video games. He was one of the first to present the computer as an \\"all-purpose machine\\".

Fictional character biography The Mother (under the alias Man of Miracles) has appeared to offer her/his guidance and wisdom to The Hellspawn so that he might play his part in Armageddon. She/he is an ageless being of practically inconceivable power who has been the architect behind most of the events in the Spawn universe, holding significant knowledge of Al Simmons and his role as Spawn, knowledge that not even Mammon possesses and possessing powers beyond that of God or Satan. Her/his true form is as the \\"Mother\\" of Existence, though she/he is neither female nor male, it is able to cast an illusion to make her/his look male. It is revealed that Mother/Man of Miracles is in fact the one who walked among mortals as \\"Jesus Christ\\", and thus was actually independent of God in the Spawn universe. The twelve heavenly warriors known as the Disciples, formed from the souls of the Twelve Apostles, actually follow Man of Miracles above God. Mother gave each of her/his infinite children a world to run as they wish; God and Satan were both given Earth. God and Satan constantly bickered and fought to the point where they declared war on one another. Mankind, being created by God (from The Mother's energy) but given free will by Satan, became unique and Mother instantly fell in love with them and decided to act on their behalf, rather than let her/his children use them as cannon fodder. Mother stripped both of her/his children of their kingdoms and made them sleep in a forgotten corner of the universe. Mother then came to Earth as Jesus Christ, spreading a message of love and tolerance. This message being corrupted by mankind, Mother saw that Armageddon was inevitable. Giving mankind a chance to survive, Mother preserved all the souls that had died in the same hour as Al Simmons and placed them inside of Spawn. Spawn represents the potential of mankind and must prove that humanity is worth saving from God and Satan's feud. Mother brought back God and Satan as the human children of Terry and Wanda Fitzgerald in order to give them an appreciation for humanity and change their ways. This plan failed, as the twins simply became more insane than before and wreaked further chaos on Earth. They have since regained their memories, powers, and kingdoms and are bolstering their armies for the final push that will begin Armageddon. Mother has also been revealed as being The Keeper of Greenworld, the voice of the Emerald Parliament and the one who originally summoned The Heap. M.O.M.'s appearance changes depending upon who is perceiving her/him. She/he has appeared as an anime-inspired hero, as Miracleman, as a mysterious woman covered in ivy who was presumably Gaia, Jesus Christ and, in her/his true form, as the Mother of Creation: a Caucasian skinned woman. When cloaked in her/his illusion, people see her/his as they want to, and she/he subsequently explains that this is because reality is far more malleable than humanity believes. In her/his anime guise, M.O.M.'s appearance changes consistently from panel to panel. The tattoos on her/his face are different each time, the logo on her/his chest appears and reappears and sometimes her/his shirt disappears but her/his logo remains visible on her/his skin. As of Resurrection and issue #250 onwards, Man of Miracles was retcon out due to legal issues with the Abrahamic origins of God and Satan now take over with the character and the arcs that feature him were retconed out; however, Mother of Existence does make a cameo in issue #297. Copyright disputes Man of Miracles was first introduced in Spawn #150. This character was very similar to the hero known as Miracleman (also known as Marvelman), popularized in the Eclipse Comics series written by Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman. In his original appearance he is named Mike Moran, the same human identity of Miracleman, with basically the same costume. Todd McFarlane bought the rights to Eclipse Comics believing Miracleman was also a part of the deal. However, the rights to the character of Miracleman have been heavily contested. In court a judge determined that McFarlane did not hold the rights to Miracleman. After this the two characters of Mother of Existence and Man of Miracles were combined into one where they were supposed to always be the same being. Due to Resurrection and 250 the character and the arcs that feature him were retconed from the series.Though Spawn 297 confirms that Man of Miracles still exists.

The club, on the corner of St. Ignatius Walk and Coronation Street, was established in 1903 as a boys' club but today welcomes people of both sexes and organises activities including sports and exhibitions. The club was officially opened on 30 January 1904 by Robert Baden-Powell, who later founded the Scout movement. Former members include footballers Albert McPherson, Steve Fleet, Eddie Colman and Brian Doyle, Allan Clarke, lead singer of 1960s pop group The Hollies, and Graham Nash, guitarist, songwriter and singer with The Hollies who went on to form Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The building gained listed status in 2003 as its tiled interior is virtually unchanged with original fittings and includes a boxing ring, snooker rooms and a gym with a viewing balcony. English Heritage said: \\"The building is thought to be the most complete example of this rare form of social provision to survive in England.\\" In 2007, the Manchester Evening News reported that the building, which was used for the sleeve of The Smiths album The Queen Is Dead, came third in a nationwide hunt to find the most iconic buildings in the country.  History  The building includes a boxing ring, snooker rooms and a gym The concept of a boys' club grew up in the 19th century as a way of keeping young boys \\"off the streets\\" and encouraging them to become \\"good and worthy God-fearing citizens\\". The clubs were usually set up by local philanthropic businessmen and it was soon realised that to compete with the outside attractions of freedom from restraint and gambling they must provide not only for draughts, bagatelle, and billiards but for more exciting pursuits that most boys could not otherwise obtain such as gymnastics, boxing, fives, swimming and, especially, outdoor games. In Salford and Manchester, a number of these clubs grew up in the most deprived areas, the first of which was Hulme Lads' Club, founded in 1850. Salford Lads' Club was founded in 1903 by two brothers, James and William Groves, from the family of brewers that were partners with Arthur William Whitnall in the Groves and Whitnall Brewery on Regent Road in Salford. Built and designed by Salford architect Henry Lord, who was also responsible for the former Salford Royal Hospital and Salford Museum and Art Gallery, the club opened in August 1903 and the ceremonial opening was by Robert Baden-Powell on 31st January 1904 three years before he founded the Scout movement. The club has held an annual camp holiday since 1904. According to club worker and local artist Leslie Holmes: \\"Salford Lads' Club has a remarkable tradition that predates the first Scout camps set up by Lord Baden Powell. Salford Lads' Club first camp was at Llanddulas in 1904, when 173 boys took part.\\" The camps have been held during Whitsun since 1934. Present day activities include football, snooker, table tennis, computer games, boxing training, dance, community meetings, exhibitions, kickboxing, excursions and jujitsu. Music, film and cultural heritage The 1960s pop group The Hollies used to practice at the club before they became famous. Allan Clarke and Graham Nash were both members and their membership cards are still in the club's archives. The club gained international fame in 1986 when the alternative rock band The Smiths posed in front of the building for the inside cover of their album The Queen Is Dead. The Smiths' music video for the songs \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\" and \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\" also featured shots of the building's exterior. The committee were said at the time to be furious, and solicitors acting for the club claimed that; > ...inclusion of the photograph may generally cause any person reading the > [album] or listening to the record to attribute the material to the club, > its committee or its members ... we would cite for example the reference in > the song Vicar in a Tutu to the singer being engaged in stealing lead from a > church roof, or indeed the very title to the album itself and the tenor of > the title song.\\" However, over the last few years the club has begun to embrace this more recent legacy and welcome the fans to the club. The photograph, taken by pop photographer Stephen Wright, was accepted into the National Portrait Gallery in 2008. The club also featured in the music video for The Dream Academy's \\"Life in a Northern Town\\". In 2003 a film documentary was made as part of the celebrations for the club's centenary. The film, which was introduced by Peter Hook, bassist for Joy Division and New Order, who lived on the Ordsall estate until he was 19, was made with the help of elderly residents and young members of the club and is a mix of interviews and location shots. The musician Vinny Peculiar, also known as Alan Wilks, has a longstanding association with the club, supporting various club events, performing for visiting Morrissey fans with ex-Smiths bassist Andy Rourke and rehearsing with his band, which includes ex-members of The Smiths, Oasis and The Fall. The building has also been used as the location for a number of films and television dramas, including Channel 4's Shameless, Granada TV's 2002 remake of The Forsyte Saga, the film version of the Jacqueline Wilson's novel \\"Illustrated Mum\\", the BBC police drama Conviction and, in 2008, the remake of the 1970s BBC series Survivors. The club was also seen in the opening sequence of BBC Sport's The Football League Show until the end of the 2011–12 season. On 19 December 2011, it was the setting for BBC One's first-ever outside broadcast of Football Focus.  Fundraising  In recent years the club has fallen into disrepair, and in May 2007, Warren Smith, Chairman of LPC Living and HRH Duke of Gloucester, launched an appeal to raise £1 million to restore the building to its former glory. The club received publicity and funds after being featured in the Channel 4 series The Secret Millionaire in November 2007. Property developer Chek Whyte initially donated £15,000 towards repairs as part of the programme, then subsequently paid for roof repairs and has become involved with the club long-term. Former Smiths' frontman Morrissey has also donated funds towards restoration. He initially wanted to keep his donation of £20,000 a secret but was dissuaded from doing so, because the publicity would help the campaign. In 2008 Vinny Peculiar released a single to support the club's £1 million fundraising drive. The song \\"Lazy Bohemians\\" was taken from his solo album Goodbye My Angry Friend. The B side and bonus download track of the single called \\"Ghost Camp\\", a song he co-wrote with former Smiths guitarist Craig Gannon, was written for a Salford Lads' Club award-winning play. The writer said: \\"Lazy Bohemians is a self-deprecating swipe against those whose talk about a revolution that never seems to get anywhere, a personal wake-up call to political apathy. My goal for this song is to really attract people's attention and wake people up from the apathy surrounding the club, making them realise that if we don't help it, the club, its fine musical history, and all of the good work it does with local kids will eventually, disappear\\".  Volunteers  Two of the longest-serving volunteers, Arthur Edward (Archie) Swift and Eric Salthouse have between them over 100 years of service with the club. They have both won accolades for their work: Swift was awarded the 'Salford Citizen of the Month' in April 2004 for his lifetime work as a volunteer at the club and Salthouse was named as 'My Hero' by Manchester entrepreneur Dave Tynan in the June 2004 edition of Social Enterprise magazine. Swift was also awarded the MBE for services to Young People. (Salford, Greater Manchester) In the HM the Queen's Birthday Honours List 2006.

On September 10, 2004, Google.com launched Simplified Chinese Google News. In 2005, Google China moved from Xinhua Insurance Building, outside Jianguomen, to Keji Building in the Tsinghua Science Park near the east gate of Tsinghua University, where Google rented two floors. In addition, Google has an office in the Beijing Fortune Center. On July 19, 2005, Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft executive and the founder in 1998 of Microsoft Research Asia, joined Google and officially became the president of Google China. On the same day, Google announced that it would set up a research and development center in China. = 2006–2009: Censorship of Google = In January 2006, Simplified Chinese Google News was renamed from \\"Google 新闻\\" (Google News) to \\"Google 资讯\\" (Google Information). On January 26, 2006, Google launched its China-based google.cn search page, with results subject to censorship by the Chinese government. Google used its Chinese name, GǔGē (\\"harvest song\\"), but it never caught on with Chinese internet users. On April 12, 2006, Google's Global CEO Eric Schmidt announced Google's Chinese name as \\"谷歌\\" (The Chinese character version of GǔGē) in Beijing. Google officially entered the Chinese mainland market. From September 2006 until August 2016, the office of Google China was a ten-floor building in Kejian Building in the Tsinghua Science Park. In March 2009, China blocked access to Google's YouTube site due to footage showing Chinese security forces beating Tibetans; access to other Google online services was being denied to users arbitrarily. On September 4, 2009, after four years leading Google China, Kai-Fu Lee unexpectedly left to start a venture fund, amid debate about the Chinese government's censorship policies and Google's decreasing share to rival Baidu and Sogou. =2010–2016: Giving up search service= In January 2010, Google announced that, in response to a Chinese-originated hacking attack on them and other US tech companies, they were no longer willing to censor searches in China and would pull out of the country completely if necessary. At the same time, Google started to redirect all search queries from Google.cn to Google.com.hk in Hong Kong, which returned results without censorship.Final sentence of the article reads \\"Google宣佈停止在中國提供過濾搜尋，並把搜尋引擎移到香港\\" (Google announced that searches in Google China will not be subject to censorship, and re-direct the entire search engine to Google Hong Kong.) Hong Kong is vested with independent judicial powerHong Kong Basic Law, Chapter II Article 19 and not subject to most Chinese laws,Hong Kong Basic Law, Chapter II Article 18 including those requiring the restriction of free flow of information and censorship of Internet traffic. David Drummond, senior vice president of Google, stated in the official Google blog that the circumstances surrounding censorship of the Internet in China led Google to move its search to Hong Kong, the absence of censorship making it more effective for networking and sharing information with Internet users in mainland China. On March 30, 2010, searching via all Google search sites in all languages was banned in mainland China; any attempt to search using Google resulted in a DNS error. Initial reports suggested that the error was caused by a banned string (RFA, as in \\"Radio Free Asia\\") being automatically added to Google search queries upstream of user queries, with prominent China journalists disagreeing over whether the blockage was an intentional and high-level attempt to censor search results. Other Google services such as Google Mail and Google Maps appeared to be unaffected. Xiao Qiang, director of the China Internet Project at UC Berkeley and founder of the China Digital Times, noted that the ban in mainland China could eventually block all access to Google sites and applications if the Chinese government wanted. The ban was lifted the next day. On June 30, 2010, Google ended the automatic redirect of Google China to Google Hong Kong, and instead placed a link to Google Hong Kong to avoid their Internet Content Provider (ICP) license being revoked. The fact that Google had ended some of its services in China, and the reasons for it, were censored in China. In 2013 Google stopped displaying warning messages that had shown up for mainland Chinese users who were attempting to search for politically sensitive phrases. Google's Internet mail service, Gmail, and Chrome and Google-based search inquiries have not been available to mainland China users since 2014. Google has maintained that it would continue with the research and development offices in China along with the sales offices for other Google products such as Android smartphone software. = 2016–present: Attempts to come back to mainland China = On August 1, 2016, Google China moved its headquarters from Tsinghua Science Park to Rongke Information Center. On December 8, 2016, Google held the Google Developer Day China 2016 in the China National Convention Center, and announced the creation of a developer website for mainland Chinese developers, including Google Developers China (), Android Developers China (), and Firebase China (). This was the first time Google China used the \\".cn\\" domain name again after giving up Google China. On August 31, 2017, Google China announced TensorFlow China (). In May 2017, Google China held Future of Go Summit with the Chinese government. On December 13, 2017, Google China held Google Developer Day China 2017 in Shanghai and announced the establishment of the Google AI China Center, led by Fei-Fei Li and Professor Li Jia. On 14 August 2020, following the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law, Google China stated that it would no longer directly respond to data requests from the Hong Kong authorities, and would instead have them go through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States.  Dragonfly project  On August 1, 2018, The Intercept reported that Google plans to launch a censored version of its search engine in China, code-named Dragonfly. The finalized version could be launched as soon as January 2019. On 6 August, China Communist Party's official newspaper People's Daily published a column which was soon deleted saying that they might welcome a return of Google if it plays by Beijing's strict rules for media oversight. Soon afterwards, Li Yanhong, the founder of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, predicted his company will \\"again be victorious\\" against Google if the U.S. search giant returns to China. Despite statements from Google executives that their work had been \\"exploratory\\", \\"in early stages\\" and that Google was \\"not close to launching a search product in China\\", on 21 September 2018 The Intercept reported the existence of an internal memo authored by a Google engineer that revealed details about the project. The memo reportedly said that a prototype of the censored search engine was being developed as an app called Maotai that would record the geographical position and internet history of its users, and accused Google of developing \\"spying tools\\" for the Chinese government to monitor its citizens. In December 2018, The Intercept reported that the Dragonfly project had \\"effectively been shut down\\" after a clash within Google, led by members of the company's privacy team.  Business  Google China headquarters in Tsinghua University Science Park in Beijing Google China served a market of mainland Chinese Internet users that was estimated in July 2009 to number 338 million,Reuters, \\"China govt centre says 162 mln Internet users\\", Reuters, 19 July 2007. up from 45.8 million in June 2002.Ministry of Culture, People's Republic of China, \\"How Many Internet Users Are There in China?\\" , ChinaCulture.org, 24 September 2003. A China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) report published a year and a half earlier, on January 17, 2001, had estimated the mainland Chinese Internet user base at 22.5 million, considerably higher than the number published by Iamasia, a private Internet ratings company.China Internet Information Center (CNNIC), \\"How Many Internet Users Are There in China?\\". China Internet Information Center (china.org.cn), 8 February 2001. The first CNNIC report, published on 10 October 1997, estimated the number of Chinese Internet users at fewer than 650 thousand people. The competitors of Google China include Sogou and Baidu, often called the \\"Google of China\\" because of its resemblance and similarity to Google. In August 2008, Google China launched a music download service, Google Music.\\"Google offers free music downloads in China\\", The Guardian, Wednesday, 6 August 2008. Google China local product—Google MUSIC's conference In 2010, Google China had a market share in China of 29% according to Analysys International. By October 2012, that number was down to 5%. It further declined to 1.7% in 2013.  Controversies  Before Google China's establishment, Google.com itself was accessible, even though much of its content was not accessible because of censorship. According to official statistics, google.com was accessible 90% of the time, and a number of services were not available at all.Official Google Blog: Google in China, January 27, 2006. Since announcing its intent to comply with Internet censorship laws in China, Google China had been the focus of controversy over what critics view as capitulation to the \\"Golden Shield Project\\". Because of its self-imposed censorship, whenever people searched for prohibited Chinese keywords on a blocked list maintained by the PRC government, google.cn displayed at the bottom of the page (translated): In accordance with local laws, regulations and policies, part of the search result is not shown. Some searches, such as (as of June 2009) \\"Tank Man\\" were blocked entirely, with only the message, \\"Search results may not comply with the relevant laws, regulations and policy, and cannot be displayed\\" appearing. Google argued that it could play a role more useful to the cause of free speech by participating in China's IT industry than by refusing to comply and being denied admission to the mainland Chinese market. \\"While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission,\\" a statement said.BBC News \\"Google censors itself for China.\\" 25 January 2006 A US PBS analysis reported clear differences between results returned for controversial keywords by the censored and uncensored search engines. Google set up computer systems inside China that try to access Web sites outside the country. If a site is inaccessible (e.g., because of the Golden Shield Project), then it was added to Google China's blacklist.\\"Google's China Problem (and China's Google Problem)\\", New York Times, 23 April 2006. In June 2006 Google co-founder Sergey Brin was quoted as saying that virtually all of Google's customers in China were using the non- censored version of their website. Google critics in the United States claimed that Google China is a flagrant violation of the Google motto, \\"Don't be evil\\".Cohn, William A. (2 – Autumn/2007) Yahoo's China Defense. \\"The New Presence.\\" On April 9, 2007, Google China spokesman Cui Jin admitted that the pinyin Google Input Method Editor (IME) \\"was built leveraging some non-Google database resources\\". This was in response to a request on 6 April from the Chinese search engine company Sohu that Google stop distributing its pinyin IME software because it allegedly copied portions from Sohu's own software. In early 2008 Guo Quan, a university professor who had been dismissed after having founded a democratic opposition party, announced plans to sue Yahoo! and Google in the United States for having blocked his name from search results in mainland China.Times Online. \\"Dissident Chinese professor to sue Yahoo! and Google for erasing his name\\", February 6, 2008 = Operation Aurora and 2010 withdrawal = On January 12, 2010, Google announced that it was \\"no longer willing to continue censoring\\" results on Google.cn, citing a breach of Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists including thousands of activists involved with the Human Rights Defender, Falun Gong, and hundreds of overseas activists in fields such as encryption, intellectual property and democracy. The company learned that the hackers had breached two Gmail accounts but were only able to access 'from' and 'to' information and subject headers of emails in these accounts. The company's investigation into the attack showed that at least 34 other companies had been similarly targeted, including Adobe Systems, Symantec, Yahoo, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical. Experts claimed the aim of the attacks was to gain information on weapon systems, political dissidents, and valuable source code that powers software applications. Additionally, dozens of Gmail accounts in China, Europe, and the United States had been regularly accessed by third parties, by way of phishing or malware on the users' computers rather than a security breach at Google. Although Google did not explicitly accuse the Chinese government of the breach, it said it was no longer willing to censor results on google.cn, and that it would discuss over the next few weeks \\"the basis on which we could run an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China\\". On January 13, 2010, the news agency AHN reported that the U.S. Congress planned to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists. In a major speech by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, analogies were drawn between the Berlin Wall and the free and unfree Internet.U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, \\"Remarks on Internet Freedom\\" , at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., 21 March 2010. Chinese articles came back saying that the United States uses the internet as a means to create worldwide hegemony based on Western values.[Lexis Nexis Academic] The issue of Google's changed policy toward China was cited as a potentially major development in world affairs, marking a split between authoritarian socialism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access. The Chinese government since made numerous standard and general statements on the matter, but took no real action. It also criticized Google for failing to provide any evidence of its accusation. Accusations were made by Baidu, a competing Chinese search engine, that Google was pulling out for financial rather than other reasons. At the time Baidu was the market leader in China with about 60% of the market compared to Google's 31%, Yahoo placing third with less than 10%. The Chinese People's Daily newspaper published an op-ed on Google which criticized western leaders for politicizing the way in which China controls citizens' access to the Internet, saying \\"implementing monitoring according to a country's national context is what any government has to do\\", and that China's need to censor the internet is greater than that of developed countries, \\"The Chinese society has generally less information bearing capacity than developed countries such as the U.S. ...\\" While Jiang Yu, a spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, promoted the Chinese government's \\"development of the internet\\", Wang Chen of China's State Council Information Office defended online censorship: \\"Maintaining the safe operation of the Internet and the secure flow of information is a fundamental requirement for guaranteeing state security and people's fundamental interests, promoting economic development and cultural prosperity and maintaining a harmonious and stable society.\\" According to Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science from City University of Hong Kong, the ruling Chinese Communist Party was deploying Chinese nationalism to stifle debate about censorship in 2010. By criticizing cultural export (in this case, the localization of Google in China), it provided defense to justify the Chinese authorities' censorship control. The Chinese authorities were accused of steering state-run media to bundle Google together with other disputes with United States that had been stirring nationalist rancour in China at the time. On the state-run tabloid Global Times such examples are found, one user wrote \\"Get the hell out\\" while another one wrote \\"Ha ha, I'm going to buy firecrackers to celebrate!\\" Isaac Mao, a prominent Chinese internet expert, speculated that 90% of Internet users in China did not care whether Google was leaving or not. Among Chinese users who strongly supported Google remaining in China without censorship (or leaving China to keep its neutrality and independence), many were accustomed to using circumvention technology to access blocked websites. Censorship =Subsequent events= Since May 27, 2014, Google's various services have been suspected of having been subject to malicious interference from the Great Firewall of China, as a result of which users became unable to access them. Since then users from mainland China found that Google's various sub-sites and other services (Google Play, Gmail, Google Docs, etc.) could not be accessed or used normally, including login to Google Account. Although some services like Google map and Google translate remained functional, users from certain places still failed to visit them. On the evening of July 10, 2014, users became able to use Google's services and functions, but users reported that access was denied the next day. =Blockage of Google= In November 2012, GreatFire.Org reported that China had blocked access to Google. The group reported that all Google domains, including Google search, Gmail, and Google Maps, became inaccessible. The reason for the blockage was likely to control the content in the nation's Internet while the government prepared to change leadership. As the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre approached, Chinese authorities blocked more websites and search engines. GreatFire said that the block was far-reaching, and that Google simply wasn't working. \\"The block is indiscriminate as all Google services in all countries, encrypted or not, are now blocked in China. This blockage includes Google search, images, Gmail and almost all other products. In addition, the block covers Google Hong Kong, google.com, and all other country specific versions, e.g., Google Japan. It is the tightest censorship ever deployed.\\" The company began to redirect search results from mainland China to its Hong Kong website, which led the Chinese authorities to block the Hong Kong site by making users wait 90 seconds for banned results. In 2009, one-third of all searches in China were on Google. , the US company had only 1.7% market share. =Keyword censorship= In 2012, Google added a new software feature to warn users when they type in a word censored or blocked in China, beginning to offer suggestions about possible sensitive or banned keywords in China. In 2017, a glitch allowed access to Google which was soon blocked again. For example, searching the Chinese character — which means \\"river\\", but is also a common surname — was blocked after erroneous rumours about the death of Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.

Its administrative limits are defined by Lope de Vega, General Paz, San Martín, and Francisco Beiró Avenues; and Joaquín V. González, Baigorría, and Campana streets. Villa Devoto, a primarily middle class to upscale neighborhood, is characterized by quiet tree-lined streets and is often considered as The Garden of Buenos Aires. A lower- density, wealthy residential subsection known as Devoto R is located around Arenales Square, in the ward's north-central section. Villa Devoto is served by the FC Urquiza and FC San Martín commuter railway lines. History Part of General San Martín Partido until the Federalization of Buenos Aires, the area was an exurb at the time and was known as Villa Gainza y Lynch. A rail link was built by the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway, which inaugurated Devoto Station in 1888. The district was named after Count Antonio Devoto, who became the landowner of most of the present day district in 1904. The Count Devoto was a member of the elite of Buenos Aires. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy granted Devoto the title of count in 1916 in gratitude for his assistance to the Kingdom of Italy during World War I; Devoto died a few months later. Devoto owned one of the largest mansions of Buenos Aires, known as Devoto Palace. The mansion was built by Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo, its 10,000 m² (107,000 ft²) decorated in bronze, silver and gold with ironwork forged in Italy, as well as Florentine mosaics. Prince Umberto di Savoia stayed there during a state visit in 1924. Devoto died before Buschiazzo's work was complete, and the mansion was demolished around 1940. He did not leave any descendants, and his remains lie at the Basílica of San Antonio de Padua in Villa Devoto. The Metropolitan Seminary of Buenos Aires, alma mater to many of Argentina's bishops and archbishops, was established in Villa Devoto in 1899; among its alumni was the future Pope Francis. The Devoto Penitentiary, the city's sole remaining jail, was established in 1927. The ward became a bedroom community in later decades, as well as home to a sizable English Argentine and American expatriate community; a Garden Club was established by the English-speaking community in 1978.

November uprising Tomasz Chołodecki was the son of Kajetan Dominik Chołodecki, the leaseholder of Bednarów in what is now the Kalush Raion in Ukraine. He attended gymnasium nearby in Brzezany and continued his education with jesuit monks in Tarnopol. In 1831 Chołodecki joined General Józef Dwernicki's forces to fight in Poland's November Uprising. He fought in all of the 2nd corps battles, starting with the Battle of Stoczek and ending with the Battle of Boreml. He was injured in that battle and was captured. After he returned to health he was released from prison and returned to Galicia. Kraków uprising Upon returning to Galicia, Chołodecki first tried his hand at becoming a mandatariusz. Finding government work unconscionable, he began working in alcohol manufacturing. During this time he continued to conspire against the Austrian authorities. He was a member of the Centralizacja Towarzyska Demokratyczna, which was run by Robert Chmielewski. His association with this organization was discovered and he was subsequently put under police surveillance. Still, this did not deter him from conspiring against the state. In 1845 he joined Teofil Wiśniowski and his Towarzystwo Demokratyczne Polskie. Chołodecki left Zarudz, where the plans for a coming uprising were being laid, on 21 November 1846. He led a platoon of Polish fighters against a group Austrian Hussar's near the Kragla Inn while battling towards Narajów. When Chołodecki received word that the uprising was being called off in the west, he fled to his cousin who lived in Kudynowce. From Kudynowce he fled to Złoczów with the help of his cousin, in order to obtain a new passport from the Starosta. He was found and arrested in Złoczów and transported to the criminal court in Lwów. There, the prosecution conducted an investigation from 23 March 1846 until 12 July 1846. After the investigation the court found 25 of the \\"Narajów expedition\\" guilty in the first degree, and sentenced to death by hanging. On 1 July 1847 the high court tribunal in Vienna reduced Chołodecki's sentence to 15 years to be spent in Spielberg. Teofil Wiśniowski and Józef Kapuściński, however, were hanged on 31 July 1847. On 23 March 1848 a general amnesty was given to those who took part in the events of 1846, and Chołodecki left for Lwów. January uprising In Lwów Chołodecki was able to get a position as the administrator of the Potocki estate. He later became the administrator in Brzoza Stadnicka. Eventually, he became the director of a sugar plant in Rytwiana. In 1855 he married Anna Madeyska, and three years later his only son, Tomasz Dominik Jozef Chołodecki, was born. He became involved in the events leading up to the January Uprising of 1863. He joined a local insurgent group and fought in the Battle of Staszów under Marian Langiewicz in February of that year. He was later captured by the Russians, but managed a daring escape. Later years Chołodecki made his way back to Lwów after fleeing from Russian captivity, and lived on his retirement income. In 1878 he took part in actions greeting Otto Hausner in Lwów, which were fought by the Austrian authorities. Chołodecki was wounded an Austrian saber cut to the head. He never fully recovered, and died on 17 July 1880, leaving behind his wife and two children. Other notes Tomasz Chołodecki was the great grandfather of Witold Franciszek Tomasz Chołodecki, who was murdered by Soviet forces in Kharkov in 1940, during what is broadly referred to as the Katyn massacre.

Samuel had married his wife Ann in South Wales in 1796, when he was 38 and she was 32. They had four children: Anna, Mary, Emma and Charles. Their Queen Anne house is now known as Howitt Place. Mary Botham was educated at home, read widely, and began writing verse at a very early age. Marriage and writing On 16 April 1821 she married William Howitt and began a career of joint authorship with him.

Not until 1823, when they were living in Nottingham, did William decide to give up his business with his brother Richard and concentrate with Mary on writing. Their literary productions at first consisted mainly of poetry and other contributions to annuals and periodicals. A selection was published in 1827 as The Desolation of Eyam and other Poems. William and Mary mixed with many literary figures, including Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. On moving to Esher in 1837, she began writing her well-known tales for children, a long series that met with signal success. In 1837 the couple went on a tour of Northern England and stayed with William and Dorothy Wordsworth.

The film's music is composed by Ilayaraja. Upon release, the film met with widespread critical acclaim.http://hindu.com/2001/08/10/stories/09100224.htm Plot The film revolves around a young girl who is forced into child labour working for an urban family after a tragedy in her own family. Paavaadai (Nassar) is a potter living in a village in the outskirts of Madurai. Even though his profession is in a miserable condition, he has high hopes for his daughter Kannammaa (Baby Swetha) and raises her with much affection. Unfortunately, he dies in an accident and this forces Kannammaa to be sent to work for an urban family. The girl is quite happy about this, thinking about the prospects of good food and clothes. The family's working couple (Ramesh Aravind & Kousalya) too treat her with kindness. However, the arrival of the mother - in - law (M. N. Rajam) changes everything. Kutty doesn't get enough food to eat and is ill - treated by the old woman & her grandson. Day-by-day things get worsen. Once, Kutty's relatives come to see how she is doing. The grandmother behaves kindly to Kutty and makes them believe that she is completely happy there. Kutty too fails to communicate with them about her misery. Kutty watches the teenage girl who works in the opposite apartment being molested. And in a few days, she comes to know that the girl committed suicide. Even though supported by the couple (which infuriates the old-woman), Kutty becomes desperate and decides to send a letter to her mother asking her to take her away back to the village. She tries to seek the help of a store owner (Vivek), who is very kind to her. However, matters do not improve when Kutty reveals that she doesn't know the name of her village but she just knows the directions. One night, she decides to run away but she runs right into a man, who has a shop set up right next to Vivek's. He promises to help her and boards her onto a train. The man is then seen speaking to another man and bargaining for more money. The man says to Kutty that the other man will take good care of her and will reach her to her mother. But, the train is actually leaving not for her village, but to Mumbai, indicating that perhaps Kutty will be sold off into a brothel. The film ends with showing Kutty's anticipated face on the prospect of going back to her mother. Cast * P.

Fictional character biography As a conflict erupts in Heaven that may well be the final war between Heaven and Hell, it is revealed that God has an abandoned creation. The forces of the Forgotten gather at the gates of Paradise, and the Angels know that soon the walls will be breached. One of the ruling Seraphim sees no alternative and releases a long-forgotten warrior from imprisonment in the hope of turning the tide. A warrior of immense power, imprisoned by God himself, she is known as Zera. Zera is the Queen of the Seraphim, one of the most powerful beings in all creation. Because she is utterly insane and has an endless blood lust, God chose to lock her away in the depths of the Shining City. In these desperate times, Zera has been set free to defend the Throne of Creation. Free to enter the fray once more, she is seen single-handedly annihilating the armies of the Forgotten Ones. During battle, Zera's insanity and blood lust manifest themselves in the form of an enormous, white-furred bestial Humanoid. This Avatar is capable of breathing white celestial fire and obeys Zera's every command. After defeating the Forgotten, Zera looks to the last and mocks him. He claims that there is still one more of the Forgotten and while Zera shakes him to try to get the name, she snaps his neck. He never finishes the word, \\"Ma...\\" which would give her the name she desires, that of Lord Mammon, the architect behind the siege on Heaven. Knowing that Hell could break through the gates of Heaven at any moment and that Heaven's forces have been seriously depleted and are no match for evil, Zera heads out to find God and return him to his throne. Keyed into the essence of God, she tracks him down and finds him in the human form of Jacob Fitzgerald. At first, he doesn't remember who he is. With Zera's revelation, his memories return and the two depart for Heaven. With his return, The Rapture begins. Later on, he is found by a now God-like Spawn after easily killing off many of Hell's forces during the Apocalypse. Though she was one of the most powerful forces in Heaven and powerful enough to completely bisect Spawn, Zera was unable to match the power of a Deity that Spawn had acquired. When Spawn decided to stop holding back, he easily killed Zera's avatar and easily defeated Zera by ripping out all of her organs. Though defeated, Zera swore that she would be back and she would never stop trying to kill Spawn. Spawn decapitated her and brought the head in front of God himself, to whom she apologized for her failure. She reappeared once more in Spawn issue 169: Voodoo Child. In this issue she is seen again now as a rotting severed head immersed in preservative liquids within a glass container. Because God loved her above all others, she had been granted immortality, and so is unable to die, even though she no longer has the rest of her body. She attempts to possess Nyx, but Spawn interferes after being summoned by the Voodoo priestess Mambo Suzanne. Zera uses Nyx's body to successfully do battle with Spawn. Mambo Suzanne, however uses the conflict as a distraction to shatter the glass containing Zera's head and throw the head to streets below. There, demon dogs devour the head until there is nothing left, thereby freeing Nyx from Zera's possession. However, due to Zera's immortality she cannot die. But how she will continue to exist without a body is left unexplained.

Based on the XPBS-1 patrol bomber, the VS-44 was designed primarily for the transatlantic passenger market, with a capacity of 40+ passengers. Three units were produced: Excalibur, Excambian, and Exeter, plus two XPBS-1 prototypes.Sharpe, 2000. p 309. Development In the early 1930s, the primary mode of long- distance air travel over oceans was in flying boats, due to the ease of constructing docking facilities on shore without having to construct runways, and the possibility of malfunction forcing a sea landing. One flying boat designer was Russian immigrant Igor Sikorsky who had founded Sikorsky Aero Engineering Company when he came to the US in 1919. In 1930, his company became a subsidiary of United Aircraft. =XPBS-1 patrol bomber= In March 1935, the United States Navy was making plans for a new patrol bomber that would have increased performance and weapon load capability from their newly procured Consolidated YP3Y-1. Prototypes were ordered from Sikorsky in June 1935 and Consolidated Aircraft in July 1936. Sikorsky's entry, the XPBS-1 (Bureau Number 9995), made its first flight on 9 September 1937, the Consolidated XPB2Y-1 on 17 December of the same year. The XPBS-1 patrol bomber, BuNo 9995, circa 1938. The XPBS-1 was evaluated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, but the Navy contract went to Consolidated. The XPBS-1 remained in naval service, temporarily operated by Patrol Wing Five at Norfolk, Virginia in 1939, then by Patrol Wing Two at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, until it was finally assigned to transport squadron VR-2 at Naval Air Station Alameda, in 1940. On 30 June 1942, the XPBS-1 hit a submerged log upon landing at NAS Alameda. Among its passengers was CINCPAC Admiral Chester W. Nimitz who suffered minor injuries. One member of the flight crew, Lieutenant Thomas M. Roscoe, died. The XPBS-1 sank and was lost.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/pbs.htm =VS-44 commercial flying boat= By 1940 Sikorsky had merged with Chance Vought under the umbrella of United Aircraft and hoped to regain the Pan Am Clipper routes once serviced by their S-42 with the new Vought-Sikorsky VS-44, based on the XPBS-1. A single deck seaplane with four twin-row Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasps rated at each, the new aircraft was in length and weighed in at for takeoff. The Boeing 314 Clipper was larger and had more powerful Wright Twin Cyclones of , but the VS-44 was faster and could fly an average payload more than , outdistancing the big Boeing by , giving it the longest full-payload range of any aircraft. The VS-44 brought home several new world records after it went into operation, but missed out on a Pan Am contract, which instead purchased the Martin M-130 and later the Boeing 314 Clipper.airliners.net The VS-44's limited production would never recoup the development costs. Operational service =Commercial service= American Export Airlines (AEA) ordered three VS-44s, dubbed ‘Flying Aces’ and named Excalibur (NX41880; later as NC41880), Excambian (no NX; later as NC41881), and Exeter (no NX; later as NC41882) after the parent company's Four Aces passenger liners. AEA had grown out of the American Export Lines steamship line, so naturally these planes gave nothing away to cruise ships. Sikorsky's standard of luxury boasted full- length beds, dressing rooms, full galley, snack bar, lounge and fully controlled ventilation. Sikorsky VS-44 NC41881 displayed at the New England Air Museum wearing American Export Airlines colours in June 2005 Sikorsky VS-44A Excambian =World War II= With the American entry into World War II, 200 of the nation's 360 airliners were requisitioned for military service. AEA's three VS-44's, now with the Navy designation JR2S-1, continued flying between New York and Foynes, Ireland, carrying passengers, freight and materiel. The first VS-44, Excalibur, crashed on takeoff in 1942 at Botwood, Newfoundland, killing 11 of 37 aboard.Oliver Moore, \\"The search for Excalibur, the doomed flying boat: The Sikorsky VS-44, a huge hulk of a plane, crashed and sank off Newfoundland in 1942. Now, a US team aims to recover its human remains,\\" globeandmail.com, Sept. 11, 2008. A proposed licensed version of the VS-44 to be built by Nash-Kelvinator, the JRK-1, was cancelled due to the availability of the impressed JR2S aircraft.Butler and Hagedorn 2004, p.175. =Postwar service= After the war, the two remaining VS-44s continued to fly for AEA, now renamed American Overseas Airlines (AOA) and operated by American Airlines. In 1946, Exeter was sold to TACI of Montevideo, Uruguay, as CX-AIR. It crashed on August 15, 1947 while landing in the River Plate off Montevideo when (allegedly) returning from a smuggling flight to Paraguayan rebels. Four out of the five crew were killed, but both passengers survived. In 1949, AOA sold Excambian to Tampico Airlines. A short-lived effort to restore the only remaining VS-44 to run freight in the Amazon was unsuccessful, leaving the flying boat stranded in Ancon Harbor, Peru. By the late 1950s, two Southern California businessmen had heard of the Excambians plight and had her ferried to Long Beach, where restoration work began. Dick Probert and Walter von Kleinsmid of Avalon Air Transport, (AAT) thought the VS-44 would be perfect for the Catalina tourist trade. AAT named her Mother Goose, to complement the line's Grumman Goose amphibians, and plans were made to utilize her for summer travel. In the winter, N41881 would undergo maintenance. Avalon Air Transport was later renamed Catalina Air Lines and continued to operate the aircraft until the late 1960s.http://www.airliners.net, photo of Catalina Air Lines VS-44 at Avalon Harbor, California Excambian carried thousands of passengers for AAT until 1967 when it was sold to Charles Blair of Antilles Air Boats. Blair, husband of actress Maureen O'Hara, acquired Excambian to ferry passengers among the Virgin Islands including service to the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Thomas and the Christiansted Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Croix.http://www.airliners.net, photos of Antilles Air Boats VS-44 in the U.S. Virgin Islands On January 3, 1969 she was extensively damaged by rocks while taxiing at Charlotte Amalie, US Virgin Islands. Damaged beyond economic repair, it was beached in March 1972 and converted into a hot dog stand. Restoration and museum In 1976, Excambian was donated by Charles Blair, original Chief Pilot of the VS-44, to the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. In 1983, the Navy transferred the aircraft on permanent loan to the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The heavily corroded Flying Boat was then shipped by barge from the Gulf of Mexico to Bridgeport, CT. Unloaded by crane, it was trucked a short distance to the Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford, CT. A temporary Nissen hut- style hangar was erected at the airport in front of hangars three and four for the project. This put the VS-44A less than 1000 feet away from the original hangar she was built in, across the street at the (then) Avco Lycoming Engine Plant. In 1987 the restoration of the Excambian began, and it was decided to restore the rare flying boat to its post-WWII American Export Airlines livery. The restoration was conducted by a team of highly trained volunteers, many of them former Sikorsky workers who had originally built the VS-44As there 50 years ago. The combined support from Sikorsky and Avco Lycoming was crucial for the success of the restoration.http://www.sikorskyarchives.com/S-44%20restore.php On June 18, 1997, after ten years of restoration, the VS-44A was transferred to the New England Air Museum.http://neam.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=884 \\"Sikorsky VS-44A 'Excambian'\\" It was there that the plane was assembled and painted. In October 1998 a ceremony was held to dedicate the aircraft.

With the assistance of local senator George \\"Doc\\" Gunther, the Connecticut Air & Space Center was founded in 1998.

The building houses Yale University's School of Architecture (it once also housed the School of Art) and is located in New Haven, Connecticut.  Construction  Designed by architect Paul Rudolph and completed in 1963, the complex building contains over thirty floor levels in its seven stories. The building is made of ribbed, bush-hammered concrete. The design was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Administration Building, in Buffalo, NY and the later buildings of Le Corbusier. When the building first opened, it was praised widely by critics and academics, and received several prestigious awards, including the Award of Honor by the American Institute of Architects. New York Times architecture critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, called it \\"a spectacular tour de force.\\" As time went by, however, the critical reaction to the building became more negative. Architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner bemoaned the structure's oppressive monumentality.  Fire  A large fire on the night of June 14, 1969 caused extensive damage and during the repairs, many changes were made to Rudolph's original design. Some have claimed that the fire was the result of arson committed by a disgruntled student, but this charge has remained unproven.  Renovation  Appreciation of the structure has increased in recent years, with Yale investing $126 million for the building's renovation. The School of Art moved out to its own building and the edifice is undergoing an addition and renovation with the intent of restoring it to the design originally envisioned by Rudolph. The renewed structure will restore the rooftop penthouse, a dismantled student lounge, and previously destroyed bridges and will be adjoined to a new Art History department. The commission for the renovation went to Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, of which Charles Gwathmey is a Yale Architecture alumnus and former Rudolph student. Previous renovation schemes by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Richard Meier, and Beyer Blinder Belle have been commissioned.

His work is rooted in folk rock but straddles other genres, including jazz fusion and funk. Phillips has recorded twenty six albums and worked with musicians including Donovan, Paul Buckmaster, J. Peter Robinson, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bernie Taupin, Tim Hardin, Manos Hatzidakis and many others. The Texas-born singer- songwriter was described as \\"the best kept secret in the music business\\" by the rock impresario Bill Graham. His biography at Allmusic states that: \\"His refusal to pigeonhole his music – which seamlessly melds folk, rock, jazz, funk, progressive, pop, electro, classical, and global folk traditions – to meet anyone else's expectations allowed him to retain his cult following without ever achieving the stardom that his talent seemed to merit.\\"  Biography  Phillips in 1971 Phillips was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of James Young Phillips, a writer of detective novels under the pseudonym of Philip Atlee and the brother of CIA officer David Atlee Phillips. He grew up in various locations around the world, including Tahiti, and learned to play guitar as a child. He returned to live in Texas in the late 1950s, and, after a time in the U.S. Navy, moved to California. Jeff Cramer, \\"A Very Candid Conversation with Shawn Phillips\\", Jeff Cramer, July 12, 2018. Retrieved January 24, 2020 He played in folk clubs in the early 1960s, alongside singer- songwriter Tim Hardin, comedian Lenny Bruce and others, and when in Saskatoon, Canada, met and taught guitar techniques to aspiring singer Joni Anderson (later Mitchell). He recorded his first single, an adaptation of Bob Gibson's version of \\"Frankie and Johnnie\\" (credited as \\"The New Frankie & Johnnie Song\\"), in 1964. While travelling to India, he stopped in London and met record producer Denis Preston, who signed him to Columbia Records. Phillips released two albums on the label, I'm a Loner (1964) and Shawn (1965), though neither were successful. Phillips also met Donovan, and the pair collaborated on several of Donovan's songs, including \\"Season of the Witch\\" for which Phillips (though uncredited) composed the melody. Phillips also appeared on several of Donovan's albums, including Fairytale (on which Phillips is credited as co-writer of \\"Little Tin Soldier\\"), Sunshine Superman, and Mellow Yellow. Through Donovan, he met the Beatles, and contributed backing vocals on \\"Lovely Rita\\". In 1967, he left England after his work permit expired, and after a period in Paris moved to Positano in Italy, while continuing to tour. He returned to England to write and perform, with The Djinn, the music for the controversial Jane Arden play Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven at the Arts Laboratory on Drury Lane in London in February 1969.Susan Croft, \\"Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven, 8th November\\", Feminist Archive North, 13 October 2009. Retrieved January 24, 2020 Sponsored by Dick James, he also recorded material with Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood of Traffic. This was intended to become a trilogy of albums, combining songs together with instrumental pieces and verse readings. He was signed by A&M; Records, but they decided to release only one album, comprising only Phillips' songs, which was released as Contribution (1970). The album, which ranged from folk rock to \\"introspective quasi-classical guitar pieces\\" was relatively successful, and Phillips released a string of further albums on A&M; through the 1970s, starting with Second Contribution (1970), and Collaboration (1971). Phillips continued to tour, and secured a standing ovation for his impromptu solo performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. He was also approached to be the lead in the Broadway production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and started rehearsing the show, but withdrew because of contractual disagreements with the show's producer, Robert Stigwood. He recorded successfully throughout the 1970s, with four of his albums – Faces (1972; No. 57), Bright White (1973; No. 72), Furthermore (1974; No. 50), and Do You Wonder (1975; No. 101) – reaching the Billboard pop LP chart in the U.S.. In addition, the singles \\"Lost Horizon\\" (No. 63) and \\"We\\" (No. 92) appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1973. According to Bruce Eder at Allmusic, his 1970s recordings \\"established his reputation for boundless, nearly peerless creativity and virtuosity... [as a] 12-string guitarist combined with his four-octave vocal range.....Writers lavished praise on Phillips for his unusual lyrics, haunting melodies, daunting musicianship, and the ambition of his records. He was a complete enigma, American-born but raised internationally, with a foreigner's keen appreciation for all the music of his homeland and a seasoned traveler's love of world music, with none of the usual limits on his thinking about music.\\" Eder continued: \\"Phillips never achieved major stardom, despite his critical accolades. He never courted an obvious commercial sound, preferring to write songs that, as he put it, 'make you feel different from the way you felt before you started listening,' primarily love songs and sonic landscapes.\\" Later in the 1970s, Phillips began experimenting with jazz and funk music. using electronic keyboards. He moved to RCA Records, and released Transcendence (1978), on which he played with Herbie Hancock and a symphony orchestra. He also wrote music for movies. After moving from Italy back to Los Angeles, he recorded Beyond Here Be Dragons with musicians including Alphonso Johnson, Caleb Quaye, J. Peter Robinson, and Ralph Humphrey; the album was released in 1988. Phillips retired from music in the mid-1990s, and qualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) and firefighter in Texas. He moved to near Port Elizabeth, South Africa in 2000 with his wife Juliette, and worked as a paramedic with the National Sea Rescue Institute. His album No Category, containing a mix of new and unreleased music featuring his longtime collaborators Paul Buckmaster and Peter Robinson, was released in 2002. In 2007, his first live album, Living Contribution, was released, along with a live DVD of the same title. His early recordings were reissued on CD during the 1990s, together with several compilations of his work. Since 2016, Phillips has resided in Louisville, Kentucky with Juliette and their son Liam.Review He now divides his time between writing, recording, touring and his EMT work. In an interview with Chicago music critic Scott Itter, Phillips was reminded that he had once been described as \\"the best kept secret in the music business\\" by the late rock impresario Bill Graham. Asked why he was still \\"a secret\\" to many people, Phillips replied: Family and personal life Before moving to Louisville, Kentucky in 2016, his wife Juliette and 12-year-old son Liam, Phillips lived in Italy and in South Africa.

It was published in 1994 by Rasputin Software. There are over hundred levels, which consist of various arrangements of blocks. Each level is divided into two sections, an active one on the left and a static one on the right. The player's task is to make the section on the left look exactly like the one on the right. The player cannot move individual blocks directly; instead, the player can select a rectangle-shaped group of blocks and move them along the rectangle's edge, either clockwise or counterclockwise. The blocks are subject to gravity, so moving a block on top of empty space makes it fall down. On later levels, various other objects come into play, such as metal blocks that can't be moved, teleporters, and bombs which destroy blocks they fall on. Legacy In 2008, the game was ported to Java and published online. In 2010, the game was ported to Android.

Origins At the beginning of the 1600s, the area of Richhill had long been part of the Irish Gaelic territory of Oneilland. In 1610, as part of the Plantation of Ulster, the land was granted to Englishman Francis Sacherevall. His granddaughter Ann married Edward Richardson, who was an English officer, Member of Parliament for County Armagh from 1655–96,Place Names NI and High Sheriff of Armagh in 1665. Around 1660, Richardson built a manor house on the site that would become Richhill, and in 1664 it was reported that there were twenty houses there.T.G.F. Paterson & Emyr Estyn Evans.

In Thomas Molyneux's Journey to the North (1708), the townland appears as \\"Legacorry, a pretty village belonging to Mr Richardson\\". It gradually became known as Richardson's Hill and this was shortened to Rich Hill. The original gates to the manor house were wrought by two brothers named Thornberry from Falmouth, Cornwall and were erected in 1745. In 1936 they were moved to the entrance of Hillsborough Castle. Village regeneration In 2012, it was announced that work would begin on a £1.5 million regeneration scheme, which will transform the village and involve the restoration of about 20 buildings. The Richhill Partnership began work in 2013 with the concealing of over head wires and cables on streets within the conservation area and building restoration work began in early March. Transport The Ulster Railway opened Richhill railway station on the line between Belfast and Armagh on 1 March 1848. It was part of the Great Northern Railway from 1876.Hajducki, op. cit., page xiii The Government of Northern Ireland forced the GNR Board to close the line on 1 October 1957. Portadown is the nearest station run by Northern Ireland Railways with trains to Belfast Great Victoria Street and the Enterprise direct to Belfast Lanyon Place in the east and south to and Dublin Connolly. There are proposals to reopen railway lines in Northern Ireland including the line to Armagh.

The film starred Jonathan Jackson, JoBeth Williams, and Carly Pope, with a supporting role by Hayden Christensen (who eventually beat Jackson for the part of Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequel trilogy). Plot Chicago college student Max Hanson (Jackson) is a talented artist and hockey player. Though more interested in the latter, he is under pressure from his mother, Sophie (Williams) to pursue a career in art, influenced by the fact that she put her own career aside to raise the family and has just landed a coveted position with a local art gallery. Max's father, Ed (Colm Feore), is a tax attorney with a more laid-back approach to his son's future, just wanting him to be happy. While working at the local video store with best friends Orin (Christensen) and Kate (Amy Stewart), a cute girl comes in with her friends seeking a copy of Arachnophobia, and Max is immediately smitten. After locating her on campus the next day, she introduces herself as Molly White (Pope), who already knows Max's name from his hockey jersey. She then gives Max her phone number and invites him to a party she's attending that night. Before long, Max and Molly are becoming an item, the two even managing to make love in his bedroom with his mother and younger sister Chloe in the house. However, Max soon finds out that Molly is a drug addict, as he accompanies her on a trek to score some heroin, which she promptly snorts. Max invites Molly to Chloe's birthday party, and though she initially refuses to attend because it's the same night as a Smashing Pumpkins concert, she later relents. However, a minor argument erupts between her and Sophie, resulting in Molly leaving abruptly and putting the brakes on their budding relationship. Devastated, Max does his best to move on, but has a hard time doing so. Finally, he's taken to a party one night by Orin and Kate, where he promptly spots Molly. She asks if they can go somewhere and talk; he accepts, she apologizes, and the two make up. The next day, Max visits Sophie at work and tries to express his feelings about Molly, but her response is less than positive. A short time later, Molly celebrates their new-found relationship by having them shoot up together in her apartment, and Max soon becomes hooked, neglecting his studies and job. Soon thereafter, Molly learns that she's three months behind on rent, and has a week to pay before being evicted. Not having enough money in his bank account to pay it, Max goes to the video store to get his paycheck, but having only worked two hours during the past week, that's all the pay he receives, and he is also given a pink slip. Sensing his friend may be in over his head, Orin offers to try to help Max, but all he wants is money to supposedly \\"fix the car\\" (though Orin sees right through this flimsy claim). After returning home, Max takes $200 from Ed's wallet; when he gently attempts to approach the subject with his son, even offering to help him out of his financial situation, an argument erupts that culminates in Sophie striking Max. Feeling as though he can never go back home, Max and Molly (who was kicked out of her place) move in with her druggie friends. Not long after, Max shows up at the ice rink attempting to steal money from Orin in the locker room, but is caught in the act (during which time we learn Max has been kicked off the team). Once back at the pad, Max catches Molly having sex with a man in exchange for drugs, and physically confronts him. Later, as their financial situation worsens, the couple is reduced to panhandling at the local mall, where Sophie spots Max, but says nothing until a few days later. After hearing this news, Ed and his other son Brian attempt to find Max, but are unsuccessful. His addiction now totally out of control, Max tries to rob a local comic book store for drug money, but is caught by the police. Ed and Brian later bail Max out, and while Brian thinks he needs to be put into rehab, Ed insists he can take care of Max at home. However, the effects of withdrawal are in full swing, and it proves to be an uphill battle. Finally, after going into a rage, Max becomes unconscious and is taken to a hospital. Once there, an arguments erupts between Ed and Sophie, with Sophie insisting that she did what anyone else would have done, but Ed retorts \\"that's a bunch of crap\\" and reminds her that neither he nor the kids made her stop painting; she did it all by herself, and that in her self-absorbed attitude, she failed to notice that all Max wanted was \\"to know it was OK to not be perfect\\". The next day, a doctor informs the family that Max needs to get into a treatment program, but stresses the difficulty of doing so. However, while this discussion takes place, Max manages to slip out of the hospital and begins frantically searching for Molly, finally finding her in a sleazy motel room where she has died of a heroin overdose. Out of his mind with grief, Max shows up at Kate's apartment and begs her for money; when she refuses, he accuses her of \\"wanting\\" him and offers to prostitute himself. Enraged, Kate throws Max out of the apartment, but in his stupor, he takes a tumble down the stairwell. The following morning, after his family had searched unsuccessfully for him, Max is brought home in a taxi, Kate by his side. Informing his mother of Molly's death, the two tearfully embrace, and as he prepares to leave for his month-long stay in rehab, he and Sophie finally reach an understanding. Sophie admits that she never saw Max for who he was and encourages him to be whatever he wants, telling Max that she loves him as the two embrace again. The film ends with Max saying goodbye to Brian and Chloe as he departs for rehab, before he and Ed drive away. DVD release The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom, first in 2004 by Oddysey Video, and again in 2007 by Infinity Vid. Although the film never received a DVD release in the United States, it has been widely rerun on both Lifetime and its sister channel Lifetime Movie Network in the years since its original airing.

It was introduced by Louise Groody and John Barker in the Broadway musical No, No, Nanette. \\"Tea for Two\\" was Youmans' biggest hit. Background Youmans had written the basic melody idea of \\"Tea for Two\\" while he was in the navy during World War I, and he used it later on as an introductory passage for a song called \\"Who's Who With You?\\" While in Chicago, Youmans developed the idea into \\"a song that the hero could sing to the heroine\\" for the musical No, No, Nanette. He soon after played his composition for Irving Caesar and insisted he write the lyrics then and there. Caesar quickly jotted down a mock-up lyric, fully intending to revise it later on. Youmans, though, loved the mock-up and convinced Caesar it was just right for the melody. The phrase 'Tea for Two' was originally shouted by hawkers on the streets of 18th century England who wanted to attract business by lowering the price of a pot of tea from thruppence to tuppence. Musical characteristics \\"Tea for Two\\" has an A1-A2-A3-B form, a range of just over an octave, and a major tonality throughout. The song's original key was A major with a false key change to C major during the second \\"A\\" section. It is melodically repetitive (as the entire song consists of eighth and quarter notes, except for a pattern of eighth, quarter, and eight notes which briefly emerge in the second section) and has a relatively simple harmonic progression. Notable recordings    * The Offspring included the song on their 1997 album Ixnay on the Hombre. It includes spoken word dialogue by John Mayer, and the track was titled \\"Intermission.\\" * Nick DeCaro solo album recorded in 1974 and produced by Tommy Lipuma with engineer Al Schmitt. Featured at Rock Roll Hall of Fame Library & Archives Nick DeCaro tribute event September 2018. Adaptations * In 1926, Boris Fomin arranged it for inclusion in his operetta \\"The Career of Pierpont Blake\\" (Карьера Пирпойнта Блэка), with Russian lyrics by Konstantin Podrevsky, under the title \\"Tahiti Trot\\". * In 1927, Dmitri Shostakovich re-orchestrated Tahiti Trot from memory after conductor Nikolai Malko bet him 100 roubles that he could not do it in under an hour.

The history of Regina, Saskatchewan, the capital of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Prior to the province's establishment, Regina served was the territorial headquarters of the then-North-West Territories and district headquarters of the territorial district of Assiniboia. 19th century =Early settlement= The Regina Court House during Louis Riel's trial. He was brought to Regina after his troops were defeated by government forces in the North-West Rebellion. Regina was founded in 1882, when the Canadian Pacific Railway, then being built across western Canada, reached the site: by the time of the North-West Rebellion in 1885 the CPR had reached only Qu'Appelle (then called Troy), some to the east of what became Regina. The Dominion Lands Act encouraged homesteaders to come to the area where they could purchase of land for $10. The city was originally known as \\"Pile of Bones\\"—the English translation of the Cree place name \\"oskana kâ- asastêki\\" (lit. \\"Bones, which are piled\\")—because of the large amounts of buffalo bones on the banks of the Wascana Creek, a spring runoff channel rising some couple of kilometres to the east of Regina and gradually becoming a substantial coulee as it approaches the Qu'Appelle Valley some ten kilometres to the north. In 1882, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, wife of the Duke of Argyll, who was then the Governor General of Canada, named the new community Regina (Latin for queen), after her mother, the Queen. giving rise to frequent use of the sobriquet Queen City. Alternate names considered for the town were Leopold (for a son of Queen Victoria), Wascana (a mildly anglicized version of the Cree for \\"Pile of Bones\\") and Assiniboia (the Aboriginal people who gave their name to the district of the North-West Territories, corresponding to modern southern Saskatchewan, a famous mountain in the Canadian Rockies, a town southwest of Moose Jaw, and a river(Assiniboine) in Manitoba. The North-West Mounted Police barracks in 1884. From 1892 to 1920, the headquarters for the North-West Mounted Police was in Regina. Because of its location on the planned route of the new transcontinental railroad — the Territorial Lieutenant-Governor, Edgar Dewdney, had reserved substantial land on the site for himselfBerton, Pierre, The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885 (Toronto: McLelland & Stewart, 1971), pp.118-25. — Regina was chosen in 1883 as the new capital of the North- West Territories, replacing Battleford, and over the in-many-ways-superior claims of Battleford, Qu'Appelle and Fort Qu'Appelle. The headquarters of the North-West Mounted Police was then transferred to Regina from Fort Qu'Appelle. In 1883, Regina was officially declared a town. The town's first mayor, David Scott, was elected on January 10, 1884. Regina remained the territorial capital until 1905 when Saskatchewan became a province. Louis Riel was brought to Regina after his troops were defeated by government forces in the North- West Rebellion in the spring of 1885. Riel was found guilty of treason during trial and was hanged on November 16, 1885. One of three territorial government buildings remains on Dewdney Avenue where the trial was conducted. The trial was re-enacted each summer by local actors in the Trial of Louis Riel for many years. This play, based on the writings of author John Coulter, was not presented in 2004, but was revived for 2005. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police training depot was established in 1874, and still survives. The RCMP chapel frame building was built in 1885 is still standing which was used to jail Indian prisoners. From 1892 to 1920, Regina was the headquarters of the North- West Mounted Police, and it is now headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Northwest Region and home of the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. 20th century Regina grew slowly for the first 20 years of its existence. With a population of more than 3,000, Regina was incorporated as a city on June 19, 1903, with Jacob W. Smith serving as the first mayor. =Establishment as the capital= The Saskatchewan Legislative Building under construction in 1908. Work on the legislative building began three years after Regina was named the province's capital, in 1905. After Saskatchewan became a province on September 1, 1905, Regina was officially decreed the capital on May 23, 1906. In 1908 the first city hall was completed in downtown Regina, while work began on the Saskatchewan Legislative Building across Wascana Lake. The years between 1903 and 1913 saw the city grow tenfold. Not only was the federal government's immigration policy finally hitting its stride and attracting large numbers of settlers from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, from the British Isles, from eastern Canada and the U.S., but adjustments to railway tariffs made the city more attractive as a distribution centre for farm machinery and other supplies needed by the settlers. The population growth set off a frenzied building boom that gave the city many handsome public and private buildings that are still standing. These include its two main hospitals, the Canada Life Building, Regina College (which became the University of Regina), Holy Rosary Cathedral (Regina, Saskatchewan), Knox-Metropolitan United Church,(although its predecessors, the then-Metropolitan Methodist Church and Knox Presbyterian Church, were destroyed during a tornado and rebuilt) and the provincial Legislative Building. An important element in the economic development of the young city was the creation of the Warehouse District on the north side of the city's downtown Canadian Pacific Railway yards. Laced by railway spur lines and encouraged by a change in CPR freight rates that made it more attractive to ship manufactured goods westward from eastern Canada, the district led the city's rapid expansion in this period. On June 30, 1912, a tornado, locally referred to as the \\"Regina Cyclone,\\" devastated the city, killing 28, injuring hundreds and destroying more than 400 buildings. The estimated $5 million in damage took more than two years to repair. Future horror film star Boris Karloff, who was in Regina at the time with a theatre company, served as a rescue worker after the disaster. The Regina Cyclone remains the deadliest tornado event in Canadian history. (Some sources state the tornado's toll was either 29 or 30.) Growth tapered off with recession in 1913, and then the outbreak of the First World War, which saw immigration, capital and pools of workmen and building supplies dry up. =Roaring Twenties= Regina Grand Theatre opened in 1912 as a stage and moving picture theatre. Unprecedented growth in the city's economy led to the development of several entertainment centres. Well underway but drastically interrupted by the First World War from 1914–1918, the city had considerable prosperity though nothing like the enormous growth in population which was initially predicted. As with other cities, Regina had numerous entertainment centres, including cinemas housing both stage productions and moving pictures — six downtown cinemas at the peak of such period, the Regina Theatre at 12th Avenue and Hamilton Street opening in 1910 and the Regina Grand Theatre in 1912 on 11th Avenue between Lorne and Cornwall Streets — which survived until television developed in the 1950s and such businesses gradually closed until only one remained in the central business district in 2012. The city was home of the first licensed airport in Canada (May, 1920) and was also the home of first licensed commercial pilot in Canada (First World War veteran Roland Groome), the first air maintenance engineer in Canada (Robert McCombie) and the first licensed aircraft in Canada (Canadian-built Curtis JN-4 (Can) G-CYAA). Economic growth resumed postwar and switched into high gear in the late 1920s, in large part due to construction of the Regina General Motors auto assembly plant in the city's northeast industrial area in 1928–29. For a while, soaring wheat prices made Saskatchewan one of the richest places on Earth, in terms of per capita income. That led to a construction boom in Regina that left the city with an architecturally distinguished generation of apartment and commercial buildings. The most ambitious such project, however, the Grand Trunk Railway's Chateau Qu'Appelle hotel at the corner of Albert Street and College Avenue (the site of the 1955 Museum of Natural History, now renamed the Royal Saskatchewan Museum), was abandoned, its building materials lying unused for years until they were eventually bought by the CPR and used in the construction of the Hotel Saskatchewan. The fiasco anticipated the later stalling of the intended Centennial auditorium, which sat only begun, derided as \\"the world's largest monkeybars\\" for years until it was finally opened in 1972 as the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts. (The oldest building in Regina still in use is the chapel at the RCMP's \\"Depot\\" Division, built in the early 1880s and later converted for religious use. Nearby Government House (Saskatchewan) was built in 1891-92 as an office and residence for the lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories.) =Great Depression= The Great Depression of the 1930s caused massive unemployment in western Canada. In July 1933, a group of farmers, labour and social organizations met in Regina to form the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, whose foundation document, the Regina Manifesto, was adopted at that first national CCF convention. Damage from the Regina Riot in 1935. The riot was the culminating event of the On-to-Ottawa Trek, a protest regarding the conditions in federal relief camps. As frustrations grew among the unemployed in 1935, 1,300 men boarded trains in Vancouver bound for Ottawa to demand work from the federal government in what came to be known as the On-to-Ottawa Trek. The issue came to a head in Regina, where the numbers had swelled to 1,800 by the time the Prime Minister intervened and ordered the protest to be disbanded. On the evening of July 1, 1935, a public meeting was called for in Market Square to bring the public up to date on what had happened so far. It was attended by 1500 to 2000 people, of whom only 300 were trekkers. The main body of the trekkers had decided to stay at the exhibition grounds. Three large vans were parked on the sides of the square concealing RCMP riot squads. Regina police concealed themselves in a nearby garage. At 8 p.m. a whistle was blown and the police charged from their concealment, setting off hours of hand-to-hand fighting throughout the city's centre. The attack caught the people at the meeting by surprise, but then anger took over. They began to fight back with sticks, stones, and anything at hand. RCMP mounted on horseback then charged into the crowd and attacked with clubs. Driven from the Square, the battle continued in the surrounding streets for four hours. Trekkers on the speakers' platform were arrested by a body of police in plain clothes. The police began firing their revolvers above and into groups of people. Tear gas bombs were thrown at any groups that gathered together. Plate glass windows in stores and offices were smashed. There was no looting, with one exception. People covered their faces with wet handkerchiefs to counter the effects of the tear gas and barricaded streets with cars. Finally the Trekkers who had attended the meeting made their way individually or in small groups back to the exhibition stadium where the main body of trekkers were quartered. When it was over, 120 trekkers and citizens had been arrested. One plain clothes policeman had been killed. Hundreds of local citizens and Trekkers who had been wounded by police gunfire or otherwise injured were taken to hospitals or private homes. Those taken to hospital were also arrested. Property damage was considerable. The police claimed 39 injuries in addition to the one in plain clothes who had been killed. The city's exhibition grounds were surrounded by constables armed with revolvers and machine guns. The next day a barbed wire stockade was erected around the area. The Trekkers in the stadium were denied any food or water. News of the police-inspired riot made the front page in newspapers across Canada. About midnight one of the Trek leaders telephoned Premier Gardiner who agreed to meet their delegation the next morning. The RCMP were livid when they heard of this. They took the men to the police station for interrogation but finally released them so they could see the premier. Scene during the Regina Riots. The machinery at the bottom of the frame is the city's tar-making machine, parts of which were used by rioters to throw at police during the riot. Premier Gardiner sent a wire to Prime Minister Bennett accusing the police of \\"precipitating a riot\\" while he had been negotiating a settlement with the Trekkers. He also told the prime minister the \\"men should be fed where they are and sent back to camp and homes as they request\\" and stated his government was prepared to \\"undertake this work of disbanding the men.\\" An agreement to this effect was subsequently negotiated. Bennett was satisfied that he had smashed the Trek and taught the citizens of Regina a lesson. Gardiner was happy that he was getting rid of the strikers from Regina and the province. The federal minister of justice made the false statement in the House of Commons on July 2 that \\"shots were fired by the strikers and the fire was replied to with shots from the city police.\\" During the long course of the trials that followed no evidence was ever produced by the Crown that strikers had ever fired any shots. Bennett further added to the misrepresentation by stating in the House of Commons the same day that the Trek was \\"not a mere uprising against law and order but a definite revolutionary effort on the part of a group of men to usurp authority and destroy government.\\" Bennett's Conservative government was comprehensively defeated in the 1935 federal election; it has been speculated that the handling of the Regina Riot may have contributed to Bennett's discrediting. =World War II= Regina General Motors plant (pictured in 1928) was closed and left derelict in the Depression, it found new use and returned to vitality during World War II. Regina like all Canadian cities contributed significantly to the Canadian war effort in both world wars both in manpower and capital. During the Second World War, young men from Regina volunteered for service, finding their way into all branches of the Canadian armed services. The Regina Rifle Regiment, one of the Allied units landing in Normandy on June 6, 1944, was raised in Saskatchewan. Its defence of Bretteville Farm on the night of June 7/8, 1944 has been credited by some historians with preventing a German armoured breakthrough that could have reached the vulnerable invasion beaches and caused havoc, delaying or even stopping the Allied advance into Normandy. The long-closed General Motors plant in Regina which had been derelict from the outset of the Great Depression in 1929 (and was never to return to private enterprise) was temporarily returned to vitality and employed many people for the duration of the war manufacturing essential materiel. The Royal Canadian Navy corvette HMCS Regina, named for the city, sank an Italian submarine in the Mediterranean in 1943, but was itself torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Cornwall in August 1944. Hundreds of Regina men flew for the Royal Canadian Air Force during the war. During the war, Regina was the home of three air force training facilities: No. 2 Initial Training School (which selected personnel for aircraft training; it was located in the province's Normal School or teachers college), plus No. 3 Air Observer School and No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School, the latter two at the Regina airport. The disused General Motors assembly plant (east on Dewdney Avenue), which had ceased operations as the Depression gripped the prairies, was requisitioned for armaments manufacture before returning to idleness at war's end. At the conclusion of the war Regina's population was about 65,000. =Post World War II Regina= The early years of the province's social democratic government (first elected in 1944) brought into Regina a rich mix of civil servants ranging from a scion of Britain's Cadbury family to expatriate American intellectuals hounded out of their own country by anti-communist investigations. New York art critic Clement Greenberg noted of Regina in the 1950s: \\"The vitality of art in Regina does constitute an unusual phenomenon. It may involve, immediately, only a small group of artists, but five such fired-up artists would amount to a lot in New York, let alone a city of 125,000\\" (Saskatchewan Council for Archives and Archivists, 2001)Clement Greenberg, John O'Brian, The Collected Essays and Criticism: Modernism with a vengeance, 1957-1969(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), p.154. Postwar, the city adopted a de facto metropolitan form of government by annexing the independent village of North Regina, located around the Canadian National Railway yards in the city's northwest, and what was then called the \\"North Annex\\"—a motley collection of houses outside the city's northern limits along Broad Street, but within the Rural Municipality of Sherwood, which surrounds the city. In both cases, the prime motivating factor in amalgamation was the prospect of these districts getting connected to the city's water lines for drinking water and sewage. Financial aid from the provincial government eased this process. After the war, Regina grew as a regional distribution centre for farming and rural activity. Not until the 1970s did the economy begin to shift from agri-base to industrial-based activity, although agriculture continues to dominate the economy of the city and province. In 1971, Jack Walker, a former RCAF bomber pilot, real estate developer and city alderman, took control of the industrial development of the city and began to diversify the local economy by encouraging light industrial business. In 1973 Deere & Co International selected Regina as the western distribution centre for all John Deere equipment. This vote of confidence in the young city combined with the expansion of the Consumers' Co-operative Refinery and the development of the Inter-Provincial Steel Co. (Ipsco) plant began to lessen the city's dependence on agriculture-related employment. Today Regina's economy is quite diversified, with strong activity in the resource, financial and telecommunications sectors. The city's centennial was marked in 1982, with Princess Anne, Princess Royal presiding over the celebrations. 21st century Skyline of Downtown Regina in 2016. The city has been working on revitalizing the economic viability of the downtown core in the past decade. The RCMP Heritage Centre is a museum that opened in Regina in May 2007. Regina's downtown core has experienced similar problems to those of other cities on the continent as the retail focus has moved to suburban shopping areas, especially \\"big box stores.\\" The civic government has possibly not discouraged the depletion of Regina's downtown core, keeping parking expenses extremely high and repeatedly approving the development of further shopping complexes on the city perimeter. A limited number of condominium projects in the downtown have perhaps slowed the outflux of people living in the downtown area but continued issues of crime in the immediately adjacent North Central neighbourhood will continue to discourage urban renewal in the city centre. Some of the larger retail centres which have failed in recent years are being converted into government office space, which may return people to work downtown. IN recent decades Regina's downtown skyline has been somewhat altered with the construction of such buildings as the twin towers of the McCallum Hill buildings, Canada Life, and Agriculture Place. Casino Regina, built in the old Union Station, attracts visitors. Regina Downtown, the business improvement district for the area, reports that it is working to re-build the economic viability of the downtown core.

His father was Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. During his time as governor of Egypt (646 CE to 656 CE), Ibn Abi Sarh built a strong Egyptian Arab navy. Under his leadership the Muslim navy won a number of victories including its first major naval battle against the Byzantine emperor Constans II at the Battle of the Masts in 655 CE. One of his achievements while governor of Egypt was the capture of Tripoli in 647 whereby he brought Libya into the Islamic Empire.

On the other hand, in his History, al-Tabari records about Ibn Abi Sarh and Muhammad that \\"Abdallah b. Sa\`d b. Abi Sarh used to write for him.

Translated by Professor Ahmad Hasan (online) Hadith 14:2677 During Uthman’s era When Uthman became caliph in 644 CE, he appointed Ibn Abi Sarh governor of Egypt replacing 'Amr ibn al-'As, with Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa as his aide. Ibn Abi Sarh brought over a large foreign entourage and established the diwan, \\"and commanded that all the taxes of the country should be regulated there\\".Archdeacon George (fl. 715), as transferred to On George's authorship of Lives 27-42: The Copts viewed Ibn Abi Sarh as a \\"lover of money\\" who spent the revenues upon himself. In his time a famine struck Upper Egypt such that many Copts fled to the Nile Delta. Soon the Arabs protested his governorship, too. Some of the protests appear to have been instigated by his aide, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa. Muhammad's father (Abi Hudhayfa) was an early convert to Islam who died in the Battle of Yamama. Muhammad was raised by Uthman. When he reached maturity he participated in the foreign military campaigns and accompanied Ibn Abi as-Sarh to Egypt as an aide. Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa admonished Ibn Abi Sarh, recommending changes in the government but Ibn Abi Sarh did not respond. After continuous efforts, eventually Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa lost patience and turned from sympathetic admonisher to a disillusioned opponent—first of Ibn Abi Sarh and later of Uthman for appointing him. Ibn Abi Sarh wrote to Uthman claiming that Muhammad was spreading sedition and that if nothing was done to stop him, the situation would escalate. Uthman attempted to silence Muhammad's protests with 30,000 dirhams and expensive presents. Uthman's gifts has been misunderstood as a kind of bribe and that caused a backfire, with Muhammad bringing the money and presents into the Great Mosque saying; :“Do you see what Uthman is trying to do? He is trying to buy my faith. He has sent these coins and these goods to me as a bribe.” Uthman sent numerous placatory letters to Muhammad, but he continued building the agitation against Ibn Abi Sarh. In 656 the leaders of Egypt decided to send a delegation to Medina to demanding Ibn Abi Sarh's dismissal. Ibn Abi Sarh also left for Medina to defend himself at the court of the caliph. In his absence, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa assumed charge of the government. When Ibn Abi Sarh reached Ayla, he was told that Uthman's house was under siege (Siege of Uthman) and decided to return to Egypt. At the border he was informed that Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa had given orders to prevent him from entering Egypt. He then went to Palestine awaiting the outcome of events in Medina. In the meantime, Uthman was killed in Medina, and when Ibn Abi Sarh heard the news, he left Palestine, and went to Damascus to live under the protection of Muawiyah I.

Some of its key proponents include David Bosch, Lesslie Newbigin, and Darrell Guder. History In 1934, the German missiologist Karl Hartenstein first coined the term missio Dei to distinguish it from the missio ecclesiae, that is, the mission of the church. Some scholars holds that this coinage, which can be traced as far back as Augustine, had a strong trinitarian basis. This language, it is argued, was picked up at the 1952 Willingen conference of the International Missionary Council (IMC) and developed theologically by Lutheran theologian, Georg Vicedom. However, John Flett maintains that while Hartenstein did introduce the actual term missio Dei, he did not locate that mission in the doctrine of the Trinity. Such reference to the Trinity appeared in the \\"American report,\\" a study document prepared for the 1952 Willingen conference, under the leadership of Paul Lehmann and H. Richard Niebuhr.For an earlier version of Niebuhr's position see, Niebuhr, H. Richard. “The Doctrine of the Trinity and the Unity of the Church.” Theology Today 3, no. 3 (1946): 371-84. For the text which informed the American report see, Niebuhr, H. Richard. “An Attempt at a Theological Analysis of Missionary Motivation.” Occasional Bulletin of Missionary Research 14, no. 1 (1963): 1-6.  Description  The \\"American report\\" suggested a link between revolutionary movements in history and \\"God's mission.\\" Many of the later contentions with missio Dei stem from these origins, and especially the failure to ground the concept in a robust account of the Trinity. The acknowledged concerns with missio Dei also meant that reference to the concept went through a hiatus until it was given concise description by David Bosch. According to David J. Bosch, \\"mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an attribute of God. God is a missionary God.\\" Jurgen Moltmann says, \\"It is not the church that has a mission of salvation to fulfill in the world; it is the mission of the Son and the Spirit through the Father that includes the church.\\"Jurgen Moltmann, The Church in the Power of the Spirit: A Contribution to Messianic Ecclesiology, London: SCM Press, 1977, 64 According to one opinion: > During the past half a century or so there has been a subtle but > nevertheless decisive shift toward understanding mission as God’s mission. > During preceding centuries mission was understood in a variety of ways. > Sometimes it was interpreted primarily in soteriological terms: as saving > individuals from eternal damnation. Or it was understood in cultural terms: > as introducing people from East and the South to the blessings and > privileges of the Christian West. Often it was perceived in ecclesiastical > categories: as the expansion of the church (or of a specific denomination). > Sometimes it was defined salvation-historically: as the process by which the > world—evolutionary or by means of a cataclysmic event—would be transformed > into the kingdom of God. In all these instances, and in various, frequently > conflicting ways, the intrinsic interrelationship between christology, > soteriology, and the doctrine of the Trinity, so important for the early > church, was gradually displaced by one of several versions of the doctrine > of grace … Mission was understood as being derived from the very nature of > God. It was thus put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of > ecclesiology or soteriology. The classical doctrine on the missio Dei as God > the Father sending the Son, and God the Father and the Son sending the > Spirit was expanded to include yet another “movement”: The Father, Son and > the Holy Spirit sending the church into the world. As far as missionary > thinking was concerned, this linking with the doctrine of the Trinity > constituted an important innovation … Our mission has not life of its own: > only in the hands of the sending God can it truly be called mission. Not > least since the missionary initiative comes from God alone … Mission is > thereby seen as a movement from God to the world; the church is viewed as an > instrument for that mission. There is church because there is mission, not > vice versa. To participate in mission is to participate in the movement of > God’s love toward people, since God is a fountain of sending love.David J. > Bosch, Transforming Mission, Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1991, 389–390. Speaking on behalf of The Gospel and Our Culture Network, Darrell Guder writes, \\"We have come to see that mission is not merely an activity of the church. Rather, mission is the result of God’s initiative, rooted in God’s purposes to restore and heal creation. ‘Mission’ means ‘sending,’ and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God’s action in human history.... We have begun to learn that the biblical message is more radical, more inclusive, more transforming than we have allowed it to be. In particular, we have begun to see that the church of Jesus Christ is not the purpose or goal of the gospel, but rather its instrument and witness.... God’s mission is calling and sending us, the church of Jesus Christ, to be a missionary church in our own societies, in the cultures in which we find ourselves.”Darrell L. Guder (editor), Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans Publishing, 1998, 4-5. Alan Hirsch believes the word missional \\"goes to the heart of the very nature and purpose of the church itself.\\" He continues, “So a working definition of missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic organizing principle is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through God’s people.”Alan Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways, Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2006, 82. Peters states that the Bible claims “the end result of such missio Dei is the glorification of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”George W.

The only sources for his life are anecdotes recorded by authors several centuries after his death, whose reliability is uncertain. Although very little is known of his life, he is considered one of the archetypal early Greek tyrants (tyrannoi). Life Aristotle claims that Theagenes of Megara convinced the Megarians to give him a bodyguard, which he then used to seize control of the city.Aristotle Rhetoric, 1357b. Elsewhere Aristotle claims that Theagenes came to power by slaughtering the flocks of the rich by a river.Aristotle. Politics, 1305a 22-4. The reliability of the story is uncertain - there was no river in the territory of ancient Megara. It is unclear how reliable these stories are: the bodyguard is a stereotypical trope in accounts of ancient tyrants' seizures of power and the meaning of the slaughter of the flocks is disputed. Aristotle presents the event as an example of a tyrant gaining power by intervening in social conflict between the rich aristocracy and the poor masses on the side of the latter.E. Stein- Hölkeskamp (2009) 107-8. Recent scholarship has suggested that this interpretation may be anachronistic and questioned whether such social conflict actually existed in archaic Megara. Greg Anderson suggests that it was part of Theagenes' efforts to assert his dominance over the Megaran aristocracy, while Thomas Figueira has proposed that the episode reflects a religious conflict over the ownership of sacred flocks. The Roman-period geographer, Pausanias attributes a fountain in Megara to Theagenes, as well as the long underground aqueduct that fed it. He said that it was \\"worth seeing for its size and ornament and the number of columns.\\"Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.40.1. Archaeologists have unearthed this fountain, but the surviving structure dates to the early fifth century BC. It thus cannot be the work of Theagenes, although it is possible that there was an earlier structure on the same site which was. Thucydides states that Theagenes married his daughter to Cylon of Athens, a victor in the Olympic Games. Cylon had consulted the Delphic Oracle, he decided to take control of Athens by seizing the Acropolis during the Olympic Games in 630 BC, with a force given to him by Theagenes. The attempt was unsuccessful; Cylon and his followers were besieged and killed. Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.126. It is unclear what the consequences were for Theagenes and Megara. Some scholars connect the failure of this enterprise with Theagenes' fall from power. Plutarch says the Theagenes was overthrown and exiled, but he does not say how this happened. After his expulsion Megara was ruled by an oligarchy.Plutarch. Greek Questions, 18. Theagenes is also mentioned in Aristophanes' Peace.Aristophanes. Peace, 927.

It is believed that the reason for adding the ‘e’ at the end of the word relates to the interplay between linguistics and phonetics: the final ‘n’ in ‘neuron’ would have been ‘sounded’ in the classical Greek, and also in Waldeyer’s German coinage, and, to do the same in French, there needed to be an ‘e’ placed at the end of the word. Without this, ‘neuron’ would have rhymed with ‘maison’ and the link with the original Greek would have been lost. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The window manager composites the window buffers into an image representing the screen and writes the result into the display memory. Compositing window managers may perform additional processing on buffered windows, applying 2D and 3D animated effects such as blending, fading, scaling, rotation, duplication, bending and contortion, shuffling, blurring, redirecting applications, and translating windows into one of a number of displays and virtual desktops. Computer graphics technology allows for visual effects to be rendered in real time such as drop shadows, live previews, and complex animation. Since the screen is double buffered, it does not flicker during updates. The most commonly used compositing window managers include: * Linux, BSD, Hurd and OpenSolaris—Compiz, KWin, Xfwm, Enlightenment, xcompmgr, picom and Mutter. * Windows—the Desktop Window Manager * macOS—the Quartz Compositor  Comparison with stacking window managers  The window manager sends each window a message to repaint itself whenever appropriate (such as when it is resized, or when another window passes in front of it). With a stacking manager, the repainting process can become corrupted when a program that is slow, unresponsive or buggy does not respond to messages in a timely manner. A malicious program can cause the system to appear unstable by simply neglecting to repaint its window. Then, one or more of the following conditions may result: * a clipped window does not repaint uncovered regions, resulting in either blank spaces or a \\"trail\\" left behind from another window * portions of windows (such as decorative drop shadows) are left behind and not properly painted over * the mouse pointer is corrupted * screen updates become unbearably slow * the entire screen freezes until the program either responds or is terminated With a compositing manager, if a window stops repainting itself when requested by the window manager, its last repaint will remain displayed and the window might be dimmed. Often, the title changes to reflect the status of the window as unresponsive. A program may prevent its window from being moved or unmapped, but generally will not cause repainting problems.  History  One of the first systems with a compositing windowing system was the Commodore Amiga, released in 1985. Applications could first request a region of memory outside the current display region for use as bitmap. The Amiga windowing system would then use a series of bit blits using the system's hardware blitter to build a composite of these applications' bitmaps - along with buttons and sliders - in display memory, without requiring these applications to redraw any of their bitmaps. Metacity window manager, part of GNOME. On March 24, 2001, Mac OS X v10.0 became the first mainstream operating system to feature software-based 3D compositing and effects, provided by its Quartz component. With the release of Mac OS X v10.2 and Quartz Extreme, the job of compositing could move to dedicated graphics hardware. In 2003 Sun Microsystems demonstrated an ambitious 3D graphics system called Project Looking Glass to layer on top of its Swing toolkit. It was first shown at the 2003 LinuxWorld Expo. Although Apple threatened to sue Sun for breach of intellectual-property rights, other window managers have implemented some of the functionality in Looking Glass. By 2006 development was discontinued by Sun, whose primary business was transitioning from graphically oriented Unix workstations to selling enterprise mainframes. Microsoft first presented the Desktop Window Manager in Project Longhorn to the 2003 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, demonstrating wobbly windows. Severe delays in the development of Longhorn caused Microsoft not to debut its 3D-compositing window-manager until the release of Windows Vista in January 2007. Implementing compositing under the X Window System required some redesign, which took place incrementally. Metacity 2.8.4 was released in August 2004. However, the first widely publicized compositing window manager for X was Xfwm, released in January 2005. On 26 January 2005 Compiz was released, introducing fully accelerated 3D-compositing to the Linux platform. KDE's KWin also supports compositing.  Compositing and 3D effects in operating systems  In compositing, 3D effects could be applied on windows to provide 3D desktop effects. Modern compositing window managers use 3D hardware acceleration. Compositing window manager software communicates with graphics hardware via programming interfaces such as OpenGL or Direct3D. The earliest widespread implementations using this technique were released for the Mac in Mac OS X 10.2, and for Linux in a Luminocity prototype. Currently, window managers using OpenGL include Compiz, KWin, and the Quartz Compositor, while Desktop Window Manager currently uses DirectX 9. OpenGL is still not fully supported in hardware, so performance of OpenGL-based compositing should continue to improve as hardware improves. =Linux= Stacking window managers running on X server required a chroma keying or green screening extension. Compositing was introduced by way of the \\"Composite\\" extension. Compositing managers use hardware acceleration through this extension, if available. Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron running Compiz's Shift Switcher in Flip mode. Under Linux and UNIX, the ability to do full 3D-accelerated compositing required fundamental changes to X11 in order to use hardware acceleration. Originally, a number of modified X11 implementations designed around OpenGL began to appear, including Xgl. The introduction of AIGLX would eliminate the need to use Xgl, and allow window managers to do 3D accelerated compositing on a standard X server, while still allowing for direct rendering. Currently, NVIDIA, Intel, and ATI cards support AIGLX. Compiz introduced a cube effect, which allows the user to see up to 6 virtual desktops at once. Each desktop is converted into a surface texture of the cube, which can be rotated at will. Compiz displays a wide array of 2D and 3D effects and has relatively low hardware requirements. In 2012, Compiz was included in Ubuntu Linux, and was enabled automatically when supported hardware and drivers were available and the user had not selected 2d Mode. Mutter (Metacity + Clutter) has replaced Metacity as the default window manager for GNOME. It is featured in the GNOME Shell component of GNOME 3.0. It uses the display engine Clutter, which has been ported to all major operating systems, netbooks and smartphones. Since version 4, KDE's window manager KWin has compositing capabilities. KWin features much of the same functionality also present in Compiz. = Java = Project Looking Glass was a window manager combining 3D rendering and the cross-platform Java programming language. It is now inactive and released under the GNU General Public License. The Granular Linux live CD distribution includes Looking Glass as an optional window manager. In the aftermath of it being discontinued, some of its features, such as cover switching and thumbnail live previews, have found their way onto other window managers. Its more original features included window tilting, two-sided window frames and parallax scrolling backgrounds. = AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS = While they are able to run on 3D-capable hardware, AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS are designed to run on old legacy Amiga computers, starting with the Amiga 1200. As such, their window managers have mostly planar rendering capabilities that include composite layering, alpha blending, gradients, high resolution and multiple desktops (\\"screens\\") that can partially clip one another. = Microsoft Windows = While the window manager in Windows 2000 does perform compositing, it does not perform transformations such as a per-pixel alpha. Few commercial applications took advantage of alpha blending; freeware programs were among the first to experiment with it, albeit through optional settings. Compositing was introduced with Desktop Window Manager in Windows Vista. Windows Vista and Windows 7 allow the user to disable Desktop Window Manager by selecting the Windows Basic appearance settings. In addition, it is automatically disabled by Windows in order to perform hardware overlay through the Overlay Mixer Filter.  Usability and eye candy  The compositing approach makes it easier to implement a number of features that make the user interface more accessible, simpler to use or with eye candy elements. = Magnifiers = The magnification effect in Compiz (click image to view in scale). Vector graphics, such as TrueType fonts and 3D-accelerated elements, can be expanded without degradation (usually due to aliasing). A screen magnifier enlarges an area of the screen, making portions of text easier to read – whether to prevent eye strain, for the visually impaired, or simply at a distance. Zoom effects such as the fish eye magnifier and zoom desktop effects provide this functionality. = Live preview = A preview of a window can be displayed in a pop-up thumbnail when the user hovers its associated taskbar button. This allows the user to identify and manage several concurrently running programs. = Window switching = Basic window switching in Xgl. Windows with similar names and icons tend to cause confusion, especially when their title bars overlap; the position of every such window on the taskbar has to be memorized. When there are many open windows in this manner, the user often has to resort to trial and error—clicking each taskbar button one-by-one—before proceeding. Window switching allows one to quickly preview several windows at once by temporarily rearranging them against a decorative background. After a selection is made, the windows are then restored to their original arrangement. Selection begins when the user either enters a hotkey combination, moves the mouse pointer to a hotspot on the screen, or, in some situations, uses the mouse's scroll wheel. Items are navigated using the keyboard or mouse. An item is selected by either releasing the hotkey, hitting the Enter key or clicking on it with the mouse.  Flip switching  Flip switching in Compiz. The flip switcher is an enhancement to the Alt-Tab switching feature. Running windows are arranged into a stack – similar to a flip-style selector in a 1950s jukebox, or a Rolodex. In some systems, the user can press Alt-Shift-Tab to navigate backwards. Visual transitions are applied to each item while navigating. Common implementations of flip switching include Flip 3D in Windows and Shift Switcher in Compiz.  Cover switching  Cover Switch in KWin. Cover switching is like flip switching with a few, mostly visual, differences. Instead of one stack with the selection at the top, two symmetrical stacks are shown with the current selection front and center (similar to the window tilting feature in Looking Glass). Cover Flow is an implementation of cover switching in macOS. More recent versions use blurring to de-emphasize non-selected items. Cover Flow has also been implemented in other software published by Apple such as iTunes. This is also referred to as \\"flick-book view.\\"  Ring switching  Ring switching in Compiz Fusion. Ring switching is like flip switching, except the windows move in a circle, with the current selection in front, usually at the bottom. Most compositing window managers include this feature out of the box, and third-party applications, such as 3d-desktop, are also available.  Grouping  The user can group windows together, such that only one window at a time is visible in each group. In Compiz, the window frame is flipped to indicate when the active window in its group has been changed.  Exposé  macOS displays a preview of every window on the screen by tiling them. Other systems with similar functionality (Microsoft Windows, Compiz, KWin, third-party applications) are referred to as Exposé clones. The hotkey to activate Exposé is not Alt-Tab, but rather F3.  Mission Control  Mac OS X 10.7 combines several other compositing features developed by Apple—such as Exposé, Dashboard, and Spaces—into a larger program called Mission Control. = Widget engines = On macOS, \\"widgets\\" (single-purpose applets) such as a clock, note pad, and calculator can appear by pressing a hotkey. Widget engines speed work by keeping commonly used widgets accessible while unobtrusive. They are handled by the Dashboard program in macOS. Compiz starts with a blank Widget Layer, allowing the user to add applications by clicking on them. A variety of widgets are supported, including Screenlets, gDesklets and SuperKaramba. Windows Vista provides gadgets that the user can place on the Windows Sidebar (Sidebar gadgets), a Windows Live start page (Web gadgets), or an external display, such as the user's mobile phone (SideShow gadgets). The Windows Sidebar was a visible partition in Windows Vista, and was eliminated in Windows 7, along with Sidebar gadgets which were changed to Desktop Gadgets. = Transitions and other effects = Before compositing window managers were developed, windows would instantly jump in and out of view, which is incongruent with the interface metaphor (and with a physical office setting). Some systems like the Classic Mac OS avoided this issue with ZoomRects, animating the windows outline \\"zooming\\" toward its final position. But on most systems, the sudden appearance and disappearance of GUI elements may seem confusing or even chaotic to inexperienced users. Visual transitions provide context and help distinguish the causal relationships of GUI elements. Instead of just disappearing, a window may fade away, or visibly shrink to the taskbar. A pull-down menu that has been clicked may smoothly radiate outward from the menu bar, making it easier to determine its origin and purpose. Gradual and natural transitions may be especially helpful for elderly or visually impaired users who notice changes to the screen more slowly and with less clarity. For example, an inexperienced user may impulsively click on a menu that was activated by accident, causing him or her to lose work. The short delay necessary to display a visual transition may give the user enough time to make a conscious decision, and avoid such mistakes. = User Interface Façades = Metisse implements user interface façades, a system that provides users with simple ways to adapt, reconfigure, and recombine existing graphical interfaces, through the use of direct manipulation techniques.

SCDS is located in the unincorporated Arden Arcade neighborhood of Sacramento, California, and serves students from all surrounding areas, including Carmichael, Davis, Elk Grove, Placerville, Folsom, El Dorado Hills, and Shingle Springs. History Seeking an academically-challenging school for their son, Greg, Dr. Baxter Geeting and his wife, Corinne, formulated the concept for Country Day around their kitchen table. About that time, Dr. Geeting met Herbert Matthews, who was teaching math at a small school in Carmichael, and convinced him to join the discussion. Soon, the school envisioned by these educators became a reality. September 14, 1964, the school opened with 12 students in portable buildings at the Unitarian Church on Sierra Blvd. The following year, the school relocated to its present campus on Latham Drive with 123 students in grades kindergarten through nine. High School buildings arrived in 1970, the multi-purpose building in 1977, and Lower School classrooms in 1979. The building boom of the 1980s produced the gymnasium (1982), the Matthews Library (1985), the administration building (1985), and the Lower School library “wing” (1985). Recent construction includes the Frank Science Center (2005), and the new Lower School building and renovation, completed in August 2008. As the physical plant and enrollment steadily grew, so did the strength and breadth of the school’s educational programs. Over the decades, SCDS added many Advanced Placement, honors, and elective courses in addition to co-curricular programs such as Mock Trial and Renaissance Day; and field trips such as Sutter’s Fort, Marin Headlands, Yosemite, Redwood Glen, and Washington D.C.; and over two dozen interscholastic athletic teams. Lower School The Lower School begins with prekindergarten and continues through the fifth grade. Middle school SCDS's middle school consists of grades six through eight. Seventh and eighth grades have specialized teachers for each subject, in addition to a home-room teacher and a rotating schedule. Each student is required to take two electives per semester. There are no final exams for middle school students. Most students in the middle school take a foreign language, either Latin, Spanish or French. Each middle school grade spends a week on an educational class trip, including an eighth grade class trip to Washington DC, a seventh grade trip to Yosemite, and a sixth grade trip to Redwood Glen. High school The high school consists of roughly 150 students in grades 9 through 12. There are many student clubs and varsity sports teams available to students. Community service is required to graduate. Students must take at least three consecutive years of French, Spanish, or Latin in order to graduate. Arts and drama activities are also available. According to SCDS publications, graduates are regularly accepted to a higher education institution, including universities such as Harvard University, Columbia University, University of California, Los Angeles, Stanford University, Cornell University, Princeton University, and other top-tier schools.Sacramento Country Day School website  Octagon  The Octagon is an established school newspaper with a staff of 22 students. The publication has previously won the Pacemaker award, an award equal in prestige to a Pulitzer Prize for high school journalism, and is a finalist for its 08-09 publications. It is a part of the High School National Ad Network and can be viewed online at SCDS Octagon webpage.  Baxterpedia  Baxterpedia is the Country Day school wiki where any student is welcome to make contributions. Named after Baxter the Owl, it's a site dedicated to recording and sharing information. Students may create pages about any school-appropriate topic they want, and, eventually, the goal is to create a database of information (much like Wikipedia) where new and old students can record and find information regarding the school.

Six other bystanders—four men and two women—were wounded. The incident took place on one of Toronto's most crowded streets on the very busy shopping day, just a few blocks north of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The story generated national news coverage in Canada and influenced the then-underway 2006 federal election campaign on the issues of gun crime and street violence. Fatality Jane Creba Jane Creba (May 13, 1990 – December 26, 2005), a Grade 10 student at Riverdale Collegiate Institute, was killed in the incident. While shopping with her sister, she was exiting Pizza Pizza on the west side of the street, when the gunfight erupted. One bullet passed through her upper torso, lodging in her clothing; it was later recovered in hospital. She was rushed to St. Michael's Hospital and died during emergency surgery. Initial arrests Police arrested two men on several gun charges at Castle Frank subway station within an hour after the shooting: Andre Thompson, 20, who was on probation at the time and Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, 17. Thompson had been released just before Christmas from Maplehurst prison near Milton, Ontario, where he had served 30 days for his role in a convenience-store robbery. He declined a bail hearing for his current charges. Police believe as many as 10 to 15 people were involved in the shooting and that more than one gun was fired. Later arrests and convictions Twenty Toronto Police detectives were assigned to \\"Project Green Apple\\" (named after her favourite food) to work on the case. On June 13, 2006, Toronto Police conducted multiple raids at 14 locations throughout Toronto in the early morning, arresting six men and two teenagers. Charges laid against them included manslaughter, second-degree murder, and attempted murder relating to the six other bystanders. All arrested are members of two different street gangs. In October 2007, a young man who was rounded up in the initial arrests, Eric Boateng, was shot dead in a seemingly unconnected incident. Boateng was not charged with the shooting, but was later charged with cocaine trafficking. As of December 2007, ten people have been charged with murder or manslaughter in the case, three of whom are youths. Those charged with second-degree murder include Tyshaun Barnett and Louis Woodcock, both 19, Jeremiah Valentine, 24, and Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, who was 17 at the time of the shootings. One of the teenagers who was arrested in June and charged with manslaughter was exonerated on October 25, 2007 after the preliminary hearing. The teenager charged with murder was committed to trial. On December 7, 2008, Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, previously known as JSR because the Youth Criminal Justice Act forbids disclosure of identities of minors, was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree. In April 2009, he was sentenced as an adult to life in prison with no chance of parole for seven years. In November 2009, manslaughter charges against four individuals involved in the incident were dropped because the prosecutors \\"felt there were no reasonable prospects for conviction\\". The four were alleged by prosecutors to have had a \\"common unlawful purpose\\" in the incident, but did not fire a weapon. In December 2009, one decliner, 27-year-old Jeremiah Valentine pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Creba's death and was given a life sentence with no chance of parole for 12 years. And in April 2010, a jury found Louis Woodcock, 23, and Tyshaun Barnett, 22, guilty of manslaughter in the 15-year- old's death, but not guilty of the more serious offence of second-degree murder. They were also found guilty of four counts each of aggravated assault, relating to other people who were wounded by stray bullets that day. Media coverage and community impact The Boxing Day Shooting was the subject of intense media coverage, particularly after a year in which the city of Toronto recorded 80 homicides and a city record 52 shooting deaths. Only one month earlier on November 18, 2005, Amon Beckles was killed outside the sanctuary of a church while attending the funeral of his friend, Jamal Hemmings, whose shooting death he may have witnessed a week earlier, on Eglinton Avenue between Oakwood and Marlee Avenues in the Eglinton West neighbourhood in the former city of York. The incident was yet another example that led to 2005 being labelled by both the media and police as the year of the gun. Detective Sergeant Savas Kyriacou of the Toronto Police Service spoke for these people in saying, \\"Toronto has finally lost its innocence. I think we're going to feel this day for a long time to come.\\" Creba's death has also caused much controversy over the causes of gun crime and the ways to handle the problem. Also controversial is the resurgence of the Guardian Angels in Toronto; they arrived in mid-January to visit the city. Toronto street patrols began in July; however, the chapter had run into financial difficulties by September 2006. Some coverage has also analyzed the disproportionate coverage Creba's death received, compared to the similar deaths of numerous men and women of colour. In 2016, some eleven years after Creba's death, author Anita Arvast released a book titled What Killed Jane Creba: Rap, Race and the Invention of a Gang War that draws into question the systemic racism that surrounded the case and still troubles Toronto.

He was the conductor of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and founder of the Festival Singers of Canada and the Elmer Iseler Singers. Education Elmer Iseler was born in 1927 in Port Colborne, Ontario, the son of a Lutheran minister. He studied piano and organ as a youth. In 1945, he enrolled in Waterloo College, an offshoot of Waterloo Lutheran Seminary that later evolved into Wilfrid Laurier University. There he studied organ and church music with Ulrich Leupold. Iseler transferred to the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto to finish his degree, graduating in 1950 with a Bachelor of Music. He then studied at the Ontario College of Education (now Ontario Institute for Studies in Education). While at OCE, he conducted the University of Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the university's All-Varsity Mixed Chorus. Iseler sang in the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir under the baton of Sir Ernest MacMillan, and in 1951-52 he apprenticed as an assistant rehearsal conductor. Career In 1952, Iseler found work teaching orchestral and choral music in Toronto high schools, an occupation he continued until 1964. From 1965 to 1968, he returned to the University of Toronto to teach choral music. In 1954, Iseler helped to found the Festival Singers of Toronto, later known as the Festival Singers of Canada, and conducted them until 1978. He then founded a professional chamber choir, the Elmer Iseler Singers. He conducted this choir until his death in 1998. In 1964, Iseler succeeded Walter Susskind as conductor of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, a position he held until 1997. The Elmer Iseler Singers formed the core of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir from their founding until 1997. Iseler was widely regarded as a leading Canadian choral conductor. \\"He brought to the Festival Singers and the Mendelssohn Choir fresh discipline and versatility, eliciting stylistic resilience, fine tuning, and a healthy sound adaptable to music of all periods.\\" In the 1980s and 1990s, he led his choirs at many national and international festivals and events. It is said that, in a long association between the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Iseler conducted over 150 performances of Messiah by George Frideric Handel. In 1975, Iseler was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for his many services in the field of music in Canada, particularly for his development of the world-renowned Toronto Mendelssohn Choir\\". He was awarded the Order of Ontario in 1995. In 1997, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Conservatory of Music and an Adjunct Professor of Choral Music at the University of Toronto, where the Elmer Iseler singers became the official choir-in-residence. Following Iseler's death, the university created the Elmer Iseler Chair in Conducting.

The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baron in 1755. The Honourable Mary, daughter of the fourth Baron, married the prominent politician the Honourable Henry Bilson-Legge, fourth son of William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth (see Earl of Dartmouth for earlier history of the Legge family). She inherited the Stawell estates and in 1760 the barony held by her father was revived when she was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baroness Stawell, of Somerton in the County of Somerset, with remainder to her sons by her first husband. In 1768 Lady Stawell married as her second husband Wills Hill, 1st Earl of Hillsborough (later 1st Marquess of Downshire). She was succeeded by her only son, the second Baron.

Yeah Right! is notable for its soundtrack, length, and the extensive use of never-before-seen (in a skateboarding video) special effects. Summary A short prologue pays tribute to skater Keenan Milton, who died in 2001. Milton was part of Chocolate Skateboards team, a subset of Girl Skateboards. The introduction credits for the video feature a unique series of shots in ultra-slow motion, filmed with Jonze's personal camera that is capable of shooting 100 frames per second. The camera is low to the ground and very close to the skateboarder as various flip tricks are completed. Although Yeah Right features mainly skateboarding, there are many special effects used. There are several different scenes in between skaters' parts which make use of green screen technology like the \\"invisible skateboards\\" bit and other camera effects such as the \\"magic board\\" and the \\"Skatetrix\\" bits. A cameo is made by Owen Wilson. He is in a parking lot with Rick Howard, Eric Koston and Mike Carroll preparing to perform a trick on a handrail. By framing the camera very carefully, it appears that Wilson attempts the extremely difficult trick (a backside bluntslide). However, while the camera was facing the opposite direction for a moment, Wilson had slipped out of the frame and is replaced by Eric Koston who is wearing a wig and matching clothes. Koston performs the trick down the staircase and Wilson reappears in the shot after Koston lands to make it look like he completed the trick.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2006. In the episode, Marge babysits for Flanders' sons while Bart is kidnapped by a chimpanzee. Plot The Simpson family attend a church fundraiser for a new steeple. Ned Flanders wins a rubber duck racing contest and is awarded a computer, although he gives it to Marge because he does not have any use for it. Marge babysits Rod and Todd to repay the favor. She finds that all the games they play are boring and overly safe, such as a \\"sitting still contest,\\" and helps Rod and Todd have fun by encouraging them to liven up. With Marge spending so much time at the Flanders' house, Homer, Bart, and Lisa go to an animal sanctuary for retired film animals. Bart sees an elderly female chimpanzee named Toot-Toot and offers her some ice cream, only to be taken into her cage and \\"adopted.\\" Ned comes home and sees Todd wearing a Band-Aid, having injured himself during one of Marge's games. Marge encourages Ned to let his kids start taking more risks, showing him a flyer for a child-safe activity center. Marge takes Rod and Todd to the activity center. Ned follows her and is surprised to see Rod climbing a structure, yelling that he will get hurt. Rod gets worried and falls, chipping a tooth against the structure. A news broadcast plays about Bart's kidnapping, surprising Marge and causing Ned to view her as a bad mother. Following this, he starts child-proofing the house, although Rod and Todd protest and tell him that they liked having Marge over. Lisa suggests that Toot-Toot is keeping Bart captive because her real son has gone missing. When Marge goes into the cage to talk to Toot-Toot, she escapes and climbs atop the unfinished church steeple. With Toot-Toot's son, Mr. Teeny, Rod climbs up the steeple and Ned encourages him. Toot-Toot happily reunites with Mr. Teeny and lets Bart go. In a mid-credits scene, Maude Flanders looks down from Heaven, proud that Rod is growing up. Cultural references The episode title refers to the book Heather Has Two Mommies. Left-handed pitcher Randy Johnson makes a cameo appearance at the Left-Handed convention selling his own line of left-handed teddy bears. Ned sings \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses with alternate lyrics as \\"Welcome to the Jungle Gym\\" while child- proofing the backyard. Ned makes a reference to the Led Zeppelin song \\"Dazed and Confused\\" when he says, \\"Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?\\" after he discovers a Band-Aid wrapper in the living room. Reverend Lovejoy's obsession with building a spire to \\"compensate for [his] own sense of smallness\\" is a reference to The Spire by William Golding.

He was educated at the Liverpool Matthay School of Music, during which time he obtained the FRCO diploma with both Limpus and F J Read prizes in organ playing. His first organ post (at age 16) was at St. Stephen's Church, Hightown. From there he went to St. Andrew's, Litherland before moving in 1955 to Chester Cathedral as assistant organist. In 1958 he obtained the degree of BMus from Durham University. In 1960 he was appointed organ scholar at St John's College, Cambridge under the then Director of Music, George Guest. Following Cambridge, in 1963 he was appointed Lecturer in Music and University Organist at Manchester University and in 1967 moved to Norwich Cathedral as Organist and Master of the Choristers. He was a part-time lecturer at the University of East Anglia. He recorded the Hindemith Organ Sonatas on the then new Hill, Norman & Beard Chapel Organ at Ellesmere College in 1970 (LP - Cathedral Organ Masterworks CRMS-850). Runnett was killed in a car crash in 1970 whilst returning from an organ recital he had given in Westminster Abbey. Composer Kenneth Leighton was commissioned by the Cathedral Organists' Association to write a memorial work for Runnett - his Second Evening Service (Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis). Norwich Cathedral has a Runnett Library in Runnett's memory, which contains all of his sheet music. It was donated to the cathedral by Runnett's parents following his death.

This specimen is a female, showing the rufous patches on her flanks. The southern fiscal, common fiscal or fiscal shrike (Lanius collaris) is a member of the shrike family found through most of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also sometimes named jackie hangman or butcher bird due to its habit of impaling its prey on acacia thorns to store the food for later consumption. It was previously lumped together with the northern fiscal (Lanius humeralis). Together they were known as the common fiscal. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the southern fiscal in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name La pie-griesche du Cap de Bonne Espérance and the Latin Lanius capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the southern fiscal. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the current binomial name Lanius collaris and cited Brisson's work. The specific name collaris is Latin for \\"of the neck. Five subspecies are recognised. * L. c. aridicolus Clancey, 1955 – south western Angola and north western Namibia (dune-fog zone of the Namib Desert) * L. c. collaris Linnaeus, 1766 – extreme southern Namibia, southern, central and eastern South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, and extreme southern Mozambique (Maputo)(except the south), Zambia, northern Botswana, and possibly also extreme south western Tanzania and extreme north eastern Namibia * L. c. marwitzi Reichenow, 1901 Uhehe fiscal – north eastern, central and south eastern Tanzania, northern Malawi * L. c. pyrrhostictus Holub & Pelzeln, 1882 – extreme north eastern Botswana (around Basuto), southern Zimbabwe (south of Harare), north eastern and eastern South Africa (Limpopo and Mpumalanga), and south western Mozambique (almost restricted to Gaza province) * L. c. subcoronatus A. Smith, 1841 – extreme south east Angola, Namibia (excluding the coastal north west and extreme south), Botswana, south western Zimbabwe, and northern South Africa (south to north western Northern Cape and central Free State) Description This is a fairly distinctive 21–23-cm long passerine with white underparts and black upperparts extending from the top of the head down to the tail. The bird has a characteristic white \\"V\\" on the back and a relatively long black tail with white outer feathers and white tips on the other feathers. The bill, eyes and legs are black. Adult male and female common fiscals are quite similar except for the rufous lower flank of the female. The calls are a jumbled mix of shrike-like swizzling sounds including some imitations and a harsh Dzzzttt-dzzzt-dzzzt alarm call. Most of those calls however are either threatening or alarm calls. The species sometimes produces a surprisingly sweet, quiet song, although such song, however sweet it sounds, generally is either territorial or pair-bonding in function. Distribution and habitat The southern fiscal lives in a wide range of habitats from grassland with fences for perching to acacia thornveld or even woodland, but avoids very dense habitats where its hunting would be impaired. Behaviour The southern fiscal is usually solitary and hunts insects and small rodents from an exposed perch or the tops of shrubs. Territorial size is directly related to the density of hunting perches. Installing more artificial perches causes the fiscal to reduce its territory size and allow more birds in the affected range. In eastern Africa, the southern fiscal is a major predator of the plain tiger butterfly.

Training a dog to participate in AKC obedience trials increases a dog's understanding and reliability in responding to commands such as \\"sit\\", \\"down\\", \\"stay\\", \\"come\\", and \\"heel.\\" At a trial, the dog and handler will perform various predefined obedience exercises, which will be evaluated and scored by a judge. The dog must demonstrate basic proficiency in order to receive a passing score (170 points out of a possible 200, and more than 50% of the points allocated to each exercise). A handler may choose to train for higher degrees of accuracy and style in order to receive more points. For example, on a recall, to receive a perfect score the dog must come at a trot or run directly to the handler, without sniffing or veering to one side, and sit straight in front of the handler, not at an angle or off to one side or the other. The dog and handler teams with the four highest scores in a given class will receive placement ribbons, and sometimes additional prizes. All dogs that receive a passing, or \\"qualifying\\" score earn a \\"leg\\" towards an obedience title. When a dog has accumulated the requisite number of legs for a given title, the AKC will issue a certificate to the dog's owner recognizing that accomplishment. Obedience competition provides an opportunity for a person and a dog to work as a highly tuned team. Training for obedience trials can provide much needed mental stimulation and physical activity for a bored housepet, and provide a fun and challenging hobby for the dog's owner. Competition obedience exercises This Smooth Collie retrieves an obedience dumbbell made of wood; others are made of metal or plastic. The exact name and requirements of obedience exercises vary depending on who is sanctioning any given competition. However, the list of exercises below provides a general description of what a dog and handler can expect at most obedience trials. Depending on who has sanctioned the given trial dogs are divided into classes based on their proficiency, age, or their handlers experience. Most organizations break down the dog and handler teams into novice, intermediate, and advanced classes. The American Kennel Club (AKC) calls these three classes, Novice, Open (intermediate), and Utility (advanced). The AKC then further divides these classes into \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" classes: i.e. Novice \\"A\\" or Open \\"B\\". The Novice \\"A\\" class is reserved for handlers who have never before shown a dog and earned a title in obedience. Other \\"A\\" classes have restrictions on the handler's or dog's experience. Depending on the level of the class a dog and handler may be expected to perform as few as five specific exercises or may be required to perform several of the exercises determined at random by the judge on the day of competition. ; Heel :Following the judges commands, the dog and handler team walks a predetermined pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling is one of the most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises. ; Figure 8 :The figure 8 exercise requires the team to heel in a figure 8 pattern either on or off leash. Generally two of the ring stewards will assist the judge with this exercise by acting as \\"posts\\", standing 8 feet apart, that the team walks around to form the loops of the figure 8. ;Sit for Exam :This exercise is a modified version of the Stand for Exam. It is generally used in novice level classes and requires the handler to order the dog to sit and then to move away from the dog the length of the leash. The judge will then approach the dog and pet the dog's head. ;Sit : There are many variations of this exercise because it is such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler to walk away from the dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class. ;Down :Much like the sit exercise the down exercise is common to all levels of competition and has many variations between governing organizations. Like the sit the judge will order the handler to down and leave their dogs. The handler will then order the dog to do this and like the sit will either walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or leave the sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. Just like the sit exercise the later two requirement as well as the length of time that dog is required to remain in the down position changes as the level of competition increases. The dog is also required to remain in the down position for a longer period of time then during the sit exercise. Also, like the sit exercise, this exercise can be performed in a group and should a dog break the down position the team will usually fail the exercise and thus receive a non qualifying score for the class. ; Recall :The handler leaves the dog in a sitting position at one side of the ring, walks to the opposite side, and turns to face the dog. On the judge's command, the handler calls or signals the dog to come. The dog must come directly to the handler at a brisk trot or gallop, and sit squarely in front, close enough that the handler can touch the dog's head without bending or stretching, but not between the handler's feet. On the judge's order, the handler commands or signals the dog to \\"finish\\". The dog must go briskly to the heel position and sit squarely at heel.. ; Drop on Recall :The handler leaves the dog as in the Recall exercise. On the judge's command, the handler calls or signals the dog to come. The dog must come directly to the handler at a brisk trot or gallop. While the dog is coming in, the judge signals, and the handler commands or signals the dog to drop (lie down). The dog must immediately assume a completely down position. The dog must hold the position until commanded or signaled to come, then complete the exercise as in the Recall. ;Stand For Exam :Following the command of the judge, the handler will stand the dog and leave from heel position. The handler will go a distance of approximately 6 feet and the judge will perform a cursory exam, touching the head, shoulders and hips, and when completed the judge will instruct the handler to return. The handler will return to the dog, going around behind it, and return to heel position. A variation on this exercise is used in advanced classes called the stand for examination. At the end of the heeling pattern instead of ordering the team to halt the judge will order the handler to stand their dog. While moving the handler will give the command and the dog must immediately stop while the handler continues moving to a point about 10 feet away. The judge will then approach and perform a more thorough exam of the dog and at the completion of the exam the dog is instructed to return directly to heel position WITHOUT coming to a front. ; Retrieve on the Flat :The handler stands with the dog sitting in heel position facing the open ring. On order from the judge, the handler commands and/or signals the dog to stay, then throws an approved dumbbell at least 20 feet. On the judge's order, the handler commands the dog to fetch. The dog must go straight to the dumbbell at a brisk trot or gallop, retrieve it, return directly to the handler, and sit in front of the handler. The dog must not mouth or play with the dumbbell. Upon order from the judge, the handler gives the release command and takes the dumbbell. The judge then orders the handler to have the dog assume a heeling position. ; Retrieve Over High Jump (Open class) :This exercise is the same as the Retrieve on the flat, except that the handler starts by standing at least 8 feet in front of a solid jump that is as high as the dog's shoulder height. The handler throws the dumbbell over the jump. The dog must jump over the jump, retrieve the dumbbell, and return by jumping over the jump again. The remainder of the exercise is the same as the Retrieve on the Flat. ; The Broad Jump :In this exercise the dog and handler will set up in heel position at least 8 feet away from the lowest board of the broad jump. On the judge's command the handler will command or signal the dog to stay in a sit, and walk away from the dog to stand facing the right side of the jump, about 2 feet from the side of the jump. The handler's left shoulder is towards the dog. The judge will command \\"Send your dog\\". The handler will command or signal the dog to jump over the broad jump. While the dog is in midair, the handler will turn 90 degrees to their right. The dog must clear all panels of the broad jump, perform a 180-degree turn and sit squarely in front of the handler. The judge will then order for the handler to finish the dog. ;Directed Retrieve :Three gloves are placed across one side of the ring while the dog and handler face the other direction. Upon the judge's order, the dog and handler pivot together to face the correct glove as indicated by the judge. The dog is sent to retrieve it with a verbal command and hand signal and must retrieve ONLY the indicated glove. ; Scent discrimination :The handler presents the judge with an approved set of 5 numbered metal and 5 numbered leather dumbbells referred to as articles. The judge selects one of each, placing them where the handler can reach them, and a ring steward places the rest on the floor or ground approximately 20 feet from the handler, being certain to touch each article. At this point, the dog and handler turn so they are facing away from the articles, and the handler uses his hands to scent either the metal or leather selected articles. The judge takes the scented article without touching it, and places it with the other articles. On the judge's command the handler turns and sends the dog. The dog must go directly to the articles at a brisk trot or gallop, select the article that was scented by the handler, and retrieve it. The exercise is then repeated using the remaining article of the other type. ; Directed Jumping :There will be two jumps in the ring that are set 18-20 feet apart. One jump is a High jump while the other is a Bar jump. The exercise consists of two parts. Each part is identical except for use a different jump for each part. The handler will stand centered between the jumps and about twenty feet from them. On the judges command to send the dog, the handler will command and/or signal the dog to go to the other end of the ring about twenty feet past the jumps. Once the dog reaches that point, the handler will call the dog's name and give the command to sit. The dog should quickly turn to face the handler and sit facing them. The judge will then order either \\"Bar\\" or \\"High\\" jump (it is the judge's decision which jump to use first). The handler will then command and/or signal the dog to return to them over that jump. While the dog is in midair the handler may turn to face the dog. The dog should clear the jump and come sit squarely in front of the handler. The judge will then order the dog to finish and assume the heel position. The exercise is then repeated with the other jump. An Australian Cattle Dog finding a scent article as part of obedience competition. :For example, in the scent article exercise, the dog searches for a dumbbell that has been scented by the handler and placed within a pile of identical metal and leather dumbbells by an assistant. The dog must find the correct article based only on its unique scent and retrieve it. Titles Obedience Titles are awarded through several organizations. In the United States, a purebred dog recognized by the AKC can compete under AKC rules. The AKC also allows dogs registered with its Canine Partners program (mixed-breed dogs) to compete; this became effective April 1, 2010. Dogs can also earn titles in the United Kennel Club (UKC), Mixed Breed Dog Club of America (MBDCA), Service Dogs Of America (SDA), American Mixed Breed Obedience Registry (AMBOR), or Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA). When a dog earns a title, an abbreviation is permanently affixed as either a prefix or suffix to the dog's registered name. The titles given by various organizations do vary, but most are similar to \\"CD\\" (Companion Dog), \\"CDX\\" (Companion Dog Excellent), \\"UD\\" (Utility Dog), \\"UDX\\" (Utility Dog Excellent), and \\"OTCh\\" (Obedience Trial Champion). The following explanation applies to AKC competition, but also generally applies to other organizations as well. Information is taken from the AKC Obedience Regulations (amended to January 1. 2012) - see references. =Companion Dog title from Novice class= The first obedience title is a CD, or \\"Companion Dog\\", which is earned through competition in the Novice obedience class. Handlers who have never earned an obedience title or have never owned a dog with a CD title compete in the Novice A division. Handlers who have earned a CD title in the past, or who do not own the dog with whom they are competing participate in the Novice B division. Novice Class involves 6 exercises: Heeling on leash and a Figure 8, Stand for Exam, Heel Free (off leash), Recall and Group Exercises: a 1-minute sit stay and a 1-minute down stay with dogs on leash and handlers at the end of the leash. Competitors must qualify (170 out of 200 points) 3 times under 2 different judges in order to earn the CD title. =Companion Dog Excellent title from Open class= The second obedience title is a CDX, or \\"Companion Dog Excellent\\", which is earned through competition in the Open obedience class. Competitors are eligible for the Open class after the dog has earned the CD title from the Novice class. The \\"Open A\\" division is for competitors who have not earned an OTCh title on any dog, who own the dog, and for dogs who have not yet earned the CDX title. The \\"Open B\\" division is for competitors who have earned an OTCh title on any dog, and those dogs who already have earned their CDX title. Open Class involves 7 exercises: Heel Free and a Figure 8 (off leash), a Drop on Recall, Retrieve on Flat, Retrieve over High Jump, Broad Jump, and Group Exercises: a 3-minute sit stay and a 5 minutes down stay with the handler out of sight of the dog. Competitors must qualify (170 out of 200 points) 3 times under 2 different judges in order to earn the CDX title. Dogs with a CDX title may compete in the Open B division indefinitely. =Utility Dog title from Utility class= The third obedience title is a UD, or \\"Utility Dog\\", which is earned through competition in the Utility obedience class. Competitors enter the Utility Classes after completing their CDX in the Open class. Teams may enter the \\"Utility A\\" division if the handler owns the dog, has never earned an OTCh title on any dog, and does not already have a UD title on the dog with whom they are competing. The \\"Utility B\\" division is for competitors who have earned an OTCh title on any dog, and those dogs who already have earned their UD title. Utility Class involves 6 exercises: 1st Exercise is called the Signal Exercise. The handler must give a signal (non-verbal) to the dog \\"to heel\\" as the judge gives a heeling pattern. At the end of the heeling pattern, the handler will be asked to \\"stand your dog, leave\\". The handler walks across the ring and at the judge's signal, the handler gives a signal for the dog \\"to down\\", \\"to sit\\", and \\"to come\\"; followed with \\"finish\\". 2nd & 3rd Exercises are called Scent Discrimination. A dog must retrieve a scented (handler's) metal and leather article. These are two separate exercises. The dog must be able to distinguish between the handler's scent and that of a person who has placed 8 other articles in a cluster approximately 20 feet away. 4th Exercise is the Directed Retrieve. Three gloves are placed approximately 15–20 feet away from the handler and dog. The handler must turn and face the glove that the judge has indicated and send the dog to retrieve it. 5th Exercise is The Moving Stand. The dog must heel with the handler and then is stopped in standing position. The handler must continue moving (10 feet) and turn around to face the dog. The judge \\"examines\\" the dog and instructs the handler \\"call your dog to heel position\\". 6th Exercise is Directed Jumping. It is often referred to as \\"go outs\\". The dog and handler are centered at one end of the ring. The dog is sent out and required to turn and sit approximately 20 feet beyond the high jump and bar jump. The dog is given a signal and verbal command to jump a high jump and in the second half of the exercise the dog is sent out again and must execute the other jump. It is scored as one exercise. Competitors must qualify (170 out of 200 points) 3 times under 2 different judges in order to earn the UD title. Dogs with a UD title may compete in the Utility B division indefinitely. =Utility Dog Excellent title= To earn the UDX, or \\"Utility Dog Excellent\\" title, a dog-and-handler team must qualify (earn 170 out of 200 points) in both the Open B and the Utility B class at a single trial to earn a leg towards the title. In most cases this effectively requires the team to qualify in both Open B and Utility B on the same day. In order to earn the title the team must do this a total of 10 times. =Obedience Trial Champion (OTCh) title= The American Kennel Club (AKC) awards an \\"Obedience Trial Championship\\" (OTCh) to the dog-and-handler team that defeats a large number of other teams in competition. The team must earn a total of 100 points, based on a rating scale distributed by the AKC. The points can only be earned by competing in either an Open B or a Utility B class. In addition, points are only awarded to dogs that placed in the top four and the number of points awarded to each dog varies depending on the size of the class. For example, a team that placed first out of 15 may only earn 4 OTCh points but a team that places first out of 50 may earn as much as 40 points. In addition to the points a team must win three first place awards - one in an Open B class, one in a Utility B class, and an additional first place win in either Open B or Utility B all under different judges. Since a team begins accruing OTCh points by competing in any Open B or Utility B class after competing the Utility Dog title, it is possible (though not common) for a dog to earn the OTCh title before completing the Utility Dog Excellent title.

The name Lespwa is the Haitian Creole form of the French l'espoir, meaning \\"hope\\". The coalition's full French name is Front de l'Espoir (Hope Front). Lespwa includes many members and former members of the last democratically elected government of Jean Bertrand Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas (Waterfall Family). USAID and the IRI attempted to form a rump Lavalas organization with Marc Bazin, but Aristide along with nearly all of Fanmi Lavalas refused to recognize Bazin's candidacy. While publicly boycotting the elections, Lavalas overwhelmingly supported the election of René Préval, which it saw as a return to peace and democracy. At the February 2006 presidential election, Préval was the Lespwa candidate. With 90% of the vote counted by February 13, he was leading with 49% of the vote. On February 16, 2006, Préval was declared the winner with 51.21% of the vote, once a number of uncounted voters were tabulated. Supporters of Lespwa found a massive dump of burned charred voting cards marked for Preval. A massive persecution upon supporters of the ousted Aristide government by the illegal interim government of Gerard Latortue preceded the 2006 election cycle. The party won in the 7 February 2006 Senate elections 18.9% of the popular vote and 13 out of 30 Senators and 23 out of 99 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies election. Lespwa's parliamentary caucus formed part of the governing coalition under Jacques-Édouard Alexis,South Florida Sun-Sentinel. but soon formed a political alliance, the Coalition of Progressive Parliamentarians, that filed a motion of no confidence in Alexis' government during the 2008 food crisis. It has since rejected two of Preval's nominees for prime minister; through the electoral alliance, Lespwa's leaders have gained a majority in the Chamber. Lespwa was disbanded in November 2009 in favor of Unity (Inite), the successor of many pro-Préval supporters, including factions from other parties.

Logan flirts with a girl, Hannah, at the carnival. Keith continues his talk with Terrence, who asks Keith to prove his innocence. Jackie takes a screwdriver from Beaver, but it was just to erase hurtful graffiti. Jackie willingly does a dunk at the carnival so that the others can express their anger at her. Keith tells Terrence that he is a major fan of him before questioning him about his relationship with the journalism teacher. Dick makes fun of Beaver and Mac. Logan continues to flirt with Hannah. Veronica asks for the ball pit to be dumped as part of her investigation, but there is nothing in there. Some footage of the stealing of the box is found, and several suspects are rounded up, including Dick, the Kane scholarship runner-up, Weevil, Madison, and Jackie. Beaver and Mac plan revenge on Dick. Terrence elaborates on his relationship with the journalism teacher, which was tumultuous. Principal Clemmons and Veronica search lockers and find about $3,000 dollars in one locker as well as some drugs, indicating that the person who stole it spent the money on drugs. The owner of the locker is Thumper. One of the items in Thumper’s locker has a number of mysterious license plates on it. Mrs. Hauser and Principal Clemmons apologize to Jackie. Veronica threatens the aide into confessing to stealing a test before they learn that Mrs. Hauser stole the money. Dick walks up to Madison before going up to a hooker posing as a student’s mom. Logan kisses Hannah before she leaves. Dick gets pranked by Beaver and Mac. He almost punches Beaver but eventually backs off. Terrence tells Keith about his gambling problem, elaborating that he rigged a game to get out of debt. Keith is angry at him, but he agrees to take his case, believing that he didn’t kill anyone.

So going down to San Diego was an experience on its own, but it was a very clean, fresh set, that set. And the people were all so nice. Kristen definitely set the bar of just being so sweet and supportive.

Club, gave a glowing review, highlighting the character development (particularly of Jackie) and the narrative structure of the episode. \\"That form also means there's a conceptual bottle episode…Although usually the bottle episode is done to save money, something I doubt is the case with \\"Magic Mountain\\" and its big set and array of guest stars, it still has those strengths.\\" Summing up his review, the reviewer wrote, \\" 'Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough\\" did pretty much everything I wanted from a Veronica Mars episode. It moved the main plot forward, it had a fun case of the week, and the characters work was magnificent on multiple fronts.\\" Price Peterson of TV.com also gave a positive review, writing that \\"This episode was jam-packed with plotlines! I liked that it unfolded in more or less the same location and in something closer to real-time than usual. Add to that some surprising twists plus the righteous downfall of Neptune High's most loathsome teacher, and this episode just worked.\\"  References   External links  \\"Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough\\" at Mars Investigations 2006 American television episodes Veronica Mars (season 2) episodes ","title":"Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough"},{"id":"4029156","text":"Rosslea or Roslea ()Place Names NI is a small village in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, near the border with County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland.

History There were several incidents in the Rosslea area during the Irish War of Independence. On 21 February 1921, a group of Special Constables and Ulster Volunteers burned ten homes owned by Irish nationalists and a priest's house in Rosslea as revenge for the shooting of a Special Constable. A UVF member mistakenly shot and killed himself during the attacks.Lawlor, Pearse. The Outrages: The IRA and the Ulster Special Constabulary in the Border Campaign. Mercier Press, 2011. pp.115-116 On the night of 21 March, the Irish Republican Army attacked the homes of up to sixteen Special Constables in the Rosslea district, killing three and wounding others. IRA volunteers were also wounded and one was captured.Lawlor, Pearse.

The bridge is about 115 metres long and 16 metres high. Etymology The term pir means \\"bridge\\" and delal means \\"dear or beautiful\\" in Kurdish, \\"Pira Delal\\" means \\"beautiful bridge\\" (though not in an aesthetic sense, but more of something that's unique). The name reflects the way the bridge is seen among the local people as well as tourists. The bridge was named Delal and the city of Zakho is called Zakhoka Delal (Delal's Zakho) in the honor of Delal, a heroine figure associated with a myth regarding the origins of the bridge (see below). History Pira Delal is believed to have been first built during the Roman era, while the present structure appears to be from the Abbasic era. Kurdish people all over Kurdistan visit the great Pira Delal as a monument of peace and enjoyment throughout the family.O’Connor, Colin (1993), Roman Bridges, Cambridge University Press, , p. 129f. One of the legends regarding construction of the bridge relates that the hands of the builder were amputated to ensure that the bridge would remain unique. Legend According to a common myth associated with the bridge, the prince of Bohtan had ordered a skilled constructor to build him a bridge on the Tigris river. Once the bridge was complete, the prince chopped off the right hand of the builder as a reward for the good work he had done on the bridge, and so that he may never build another bridge that well-crafted anywhere else. When the builder arrived in Zakho City, the mayor of the city requested the builder to build a bridge that will connect the two sides of the Khabur river that goes to Zakho. The builder accepted the request in spite of the Bohtan prince who cut off his right hand. When the builder got to the middle part of the bridge, it would always collapse. To solve this, one of the fortune tellers in the city notified the builder that he should bury whoever sets foot on the bridge first, man or beast, under it as a sacrifice. A day later, the builder's niece Delal was fetching him his lunch, with her dog. The builder was initially content because the dog was running in front of his niece and thus he thought that the dog will be the first to step on the bridge. However though, as soon as they approached the bridge, the dog stopped and got busy sniffing, so Delal stepped on the bridge first. As the builder saw Delal reaching the bridge first he went into shock and fainted for a brief period of time. After regaining his consciousness, the builder told Delal about the bridge story. Delal informed the builder that she is ready to sacrifice her life for her city. So the builder ultimately buried her under the bridge. When Delal's husband arrived to the city after knowing what happened, he took a pick axe and started digging under the bridge. While he was digging, he heard his buried wife Delal's muffled voice commanding him to refrain from digging and that he is physically hurting her with his digging, declaring that she wants to keep holding this bridge together with her arms and to stay there for all eternity. He eventually ceased and accepted her fate. Since then the inhabitants would grow two lengthy plants in one of the gaps between the stones on one side of the bridge, and would think of them as Delal's hair braids.Pira Delal in Zakho See also *List of Roman bridges References Abbasid architecture Bridges in Iraq Roman bridges Zakho ","title":"Pira Delal"},{"id":"4029188","text":"The Methye Portage or Portage La Loche in northwestern Saskatchewan was one of the most important portages in the old fur trade route across Canada. The portage connected the Mackenzie River basin to rivers that ran east to the Atlantic. It was reached by Peter Pond in 1778 and abandoned in 1883 when steamboats began running on the Athabasca River with links to the railroad. It ranks with Grand Portage as one of the two most important and difficult portages used during the fur trade era. 'Methye' is Cree and 'La Loche' is French for a fish that is called 'burbot' in English. Although 'Methye Portage' is often used the official name since 1957 is Portage La Loche. Both names are used in historical documents, books and journals. Alexander Mackenzie in his book \\"Voyages from Montreal\\" used both Portage la Loche and Mithy-Ouinigam Portage (in 1789–1793). History The Clearwater River valley from the portage by George Back in 1825 The Methye Portage had been in use by indigenous peoples as a trade route for generations. They introduced it to Peter Pond in 1778. Although Anthony Henday had come within sight of the Rocky Mountains in 1754 by overland routes to the south, the advance of western exploration was limited until this fur trade transportation route to the Athabasca opened. The portage was in constant use until 1883 when the Canadian Pacific Railway reached Calgary ending more than 100 years as the main access to the north. From the winter of 1822, York boats came into use on this route in addition to canoes. Furs were transported up the Clearwater River by crews who would bring them to the centre of the portage, where they would be picked up by crews from Norway House for that portion of their transport. It also allowed for the spread of smallpox to previously untouched indigenous populations, decimating them in a matter of years. The Methye Portage was also used by Sir Alexander Mackenzie on his exploratory expedition to the west coast, an expedition which reached the Pacific Ocean in 1793, fully 12 years before the more famous Lewis and Clark Expedition. From 1826 to the early 1870s the Portage La Loche Brigade from Fort Garry arrived at the Portage in July. This famous brigade of York boats would then return via Norway House and York Factory to the Red River Settlement; a round trip. For a number of years this brigade was under the leadership of Alexis Bonami. =Missionary activity= After the first Oblates opened a mission in Île-à-la-Crosse in 1846 a Catholic priest was usually present when the brigades arrived at the portage. They were well received by the French Métis from the Red River Colony and by the Chipewyan. Father Émile Petitot describes his reception in 1862. In July 1845 Louis Laferte dit Schmidt, who was born on December 4, 1844 at Old Fort near Fort Chipewyan, was baptised at Methye Portage by Father Jean- Baptiste Thibault. Another noted baptism at Methye Portage was Francois Beaulieu who was baptised in 1848 by Bishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché. Route Lac La Loche with a view towards the Portage The trade route began on Lake Winnipeg and ran west up the Saskatchewan River to Cumberland House, Saskatchewan north up the Sturgeon-Weir River, across Frog Portage to the Churchill River, west up the Churchill past the depot on Lac Île-à-la-Crosse, through Peter Pond Lake to Lac La Loche. The portage proper, which is long, began at Wallis Bay on the north side of Lac La Loche. The path ascends slowly for to the small Rendezvous Lake. Here, crews coming from the north and south would exchange their loads. Different boats were used on the two sides of the portage and were rarely carried across it. The path ascends slowly from Rendezvous Lake until there is suddenly a view of the Clearwater River valley and the path descends about in to the Clearwater. The altitude of Lac La Loche is about , Rendezvous Lake about and the Clearwater about . This section is so steep that sledges, horses and oxen were used. The portage road, which is wide enough for a wagon, is still visible. Having used the portage to reach the Mackenzie River basin, the route went west down the Clearwater River to the modern Fort McMurray and then north down Athabasca River to Fort Chipewyan and beyond. =Staging area= John Franklin's 1819-20 expedition map shows the fur trade route from Peter Pond Lake, up the La Loche River (Methye River), across Lac La Loche (Methye Lake), across the Portage to the west flowing Clearwater River then north up the Athabasca River. Early trading posts of the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company are shown on the south west side of Lac La Loche. For two weeks every July the south end of the portage was the main staging area for transferring freight from each end of the trail. In 1862 there were 400 people at the portage according to Father Émile Petitot. There were the two Portage La Loche brigades with 7 boats each and the Athabasca and Mackenzie brigades with 5 boats each. They had 225 men as crew and over 30 passengers. One canot du nord arrived with a crew of 6-8 Iroquois and two passengers. Dene residents from the surrounding area were camped at the portage in a tipi village of 150 people. The Hudson's Bay Company had 10 employees at the fort who maintained the transportation depots at each end of the portage and brought in horses, oxen and carts for the season. Petitot wrote \\"While there were no more than 400 people gathered at the time on the south side of the portage they gave us a little understanding of the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel. There were people from French Canada, Scotland, Orkney, England, Norway. There were Woodland Cree, Swampy Cree, Chippewa, Chipewyan, Beaver and Métis of all kinds. Grouard and I represented the French.\\" (translation). =Portage trail= Made by rdlaloche in 2011 Names were given to different locations on the Portage trail by the fur brigades. On the table starting from the south end are some of the names in French and their translation. These resting places were measured in paces wrote Sir John Richardson in 1848. From the Tail of La Loche to Little Old Man the distance was 2,557 paces. Another 3,171 paces led to Fountain of Sand and so on. The total number of paces from the Tail of La Loche to The Meadow is 24,593 or 1,294 paces per kilometre. Most of these resting places on the Portage have not yet been identified. Under ideal conditions is walked at an easy pace in about 4 hours. =Cemetery= Along the Portage Trail there were marked graves from the fur trade era according to the following Oblate account written in 1933 by Father Louis Moraud. National historic site Ice break- up on Lac La Loche May 13, 2013 (Ice covers the lake from about the middle of November to about the middle of May). The Methye Portage was designated a National Historic Site in 1933 and the Clearwater River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1986.

Both stations were owned by the Cowles family, publishers of the Des Moines Register. During those early years, Drake-Chenault's automated \\"Hit Parade\\" format was aired. In 1974, the station became KRNQ (\\"Q-102\\").Des Moines Station Timeline, DesMoinesBroadcasting.com, accessed February 11, 2006 That year, Cowles sold KRNQ and KRNT (AM) to Stauffer Communications of Topeka, Kansas. The two stations were sold to Saga Communications in August 1988. KRNQ was originally an automated Top 40 station. In 1984, the automation ended and the station began using local DJs. By the end of the 1980s, KRNQ was at or near the top of the local Arbitron ratings. In 1991, due to Saga's desire to reach older listeners, Q102's youthful Top 40 format was changed to a slightly older Hot Adult Contemporary format and was known as \\"Q102/KRNQ, Today's Hits and Yesterday's Favorites.\\" KRNQ promised to play no rap (even though it was rarely played on the station after Saga's purchase in 1988) and no hard rock, both of which were very much a part of popular music at the time. This format change left Des Moines with no contemporary hits outlet for nine years, until KKDM's flip from Alternative to Top 40/CHR in 1999. KRNQ became KSTZ on June 25, 1993. (The KRNQ call letters are now used for a station in Keokuk, Iowa.) When the station reimaged itself to adult contemporary in 1993, the positioning statement the station used was \\"Superstars of the 70s, 80s and 90s\\" (with the 'STZ' in the call letters forming an abbreviation for 'stars'). The station later switched to \\"The Best Variety of the 80s, 90s and Today.\\" In 2001, the station began using the current positioning statement of \\"Today's Best Variety,\\" returning to a Hot AC direction. With KKDM becoming more of a factor since its 1999 debut, KSTZ has adjusted its playlist and adopted an Adult Top 40 format by adding a limited amount of adult-friendly rhythmic music with artists such Rihanna and The Black Eyed Peas in the mix.

Liddle syndrome involves abnormal kidney function, with excess reabsorption of sodium and loss of potassium from the renal tubule, and is treated with a combination of low sodium diet and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride). It is extremely rare, with fewer than 30 pedigrees or isolated cases having been reported worldwide as of 2008. Signs and symptoms Children with Liddle syndrome are frequently asymptomatic. The first indication of the syndrome often is the incidental finding of hypertension during a routine physical exam. Because this syndrome is rare, it may only be considered by the treating physician after the child's hypertension does not respond to medications for lowering blood pressure. Adults could present with nonspecific symptoms of low blood potassium, which can include weakness, fatigue, palpitations or muscular weakness (shortness of breath, constipation/abdominal distention or exercise intolerance). Additionally, long-standing hypertension could become symptomatic. Cause This syndrome is caused by dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus. These channels are found on the surface of epithelial cells found in the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC transports sodium into cells. The mutation changes a domain in the channel so it is no longer degraded correctly by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Specifically, the PY motif in the protein is deleted or altered so the E3 ligase (Nedd4) no longer recognizes the channel. This loss of ability to be degraded leads to high amounts of the channel being chronically present in the collecting duct. This results in a hyperaldosteronism-like state, since aldosterone is typically responsible for creating and inserting these channels. The increased sodium resorption leads to increased resorption of water, and hypertension due to an increase in extracellular volume. Liddle syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Diagnosis Evaluation of a child with persistent high blood pressure usually involves analysis of blood electrolytes and an aldosterone level, as well as other tests. In Liddle's disease, the serum sodium is typically elevated, the serum potassium is reduced,Brenner and Rector's The Kidney, 8th ed. CHAPTER 40 – Inherited Disorders of the Renal Tubule. Section on Liddle Syndrome. Accessed via MDConsult. and the serum bicarbonate is elevated. These findings are also found in hyperaldosteronism, another rare cause of hypertension in children. Primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome), is due to an aldosterone-secreting adrenal tumor (adenoma) or adrenal hyperplasia. Aldosterone levels are high in hyperaldosteronism, whereas they are low to normal in Liddle syndrome. A genetic study of the ENaC sequences can be requested to detect mutations (deletions, insertions, missense mutations) and get a diagnosis. Treatment The treatment is with a low sodium (low salt) diet and a potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the sodium channel. Potassium-sparing diuretics that are effective for this purpose include amiloride and triamterene; spironolactone is not effective because it acts by regulating aldosterone and Liddle syndrome does not respond to this regulation. Amiloride is the only treatment option that is safe in pregnancy. Medical treatment usually corrects both the hypertension and the hypokalemia, and as a result these patients may not require any potassium replacement therapy. Liddle syndrome resolves completely after kidney transplantation. History It is named after Dr. Grant Liddle (1921–1989), an American endocrinologist at Vanderbilt University, who described it in 1963.Liddle GW, Bledose T and Coppage Jr WS. A familial renal disorder simulating primary aldosteronism with negligible aldosterone secretion (1963). Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians, 76, 199–213.

Most had very long necks and long, whip-like tails; however, one family (the dicraeosaurids) are the only known sauropods to have re-evolved a short neck, presumably an adaptation for feeding low to the ground. This adaptation was taken to the extreme in the highly specialized sauropod Brachytrachelopan. A study of snout shape and dental microwear in diplodocoids showed that the square snouts, large proportion of pits, and fine subparallel scratches in Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus, and Rebbachisaurus suggest ground-height nonselective browsing; the narrow snouts of Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, and Tornieria and the coarse scratches and gouges on the teeth of Dicraeosaurus suggest mid-height selective browsing in those taxa.John A.

Rotberg The army is divided into seven brigades and a 'Special Force' reserved for special operations.'Special Force' Joins KNLA on High Alert  History  = Pre-1990 = At the time of Burmese independence from the British in 1948, there was considerable tension between the Karen community and the Burmese majority. Some Karens sought independence while others attempted co-existence within Burma. The KNLA was previously called the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO). The KNDO was an armed organisation which was formed by the KNU in 1947 to defend Karen communities and interests. Most KNDO soldiers had previously served in the forces of British Burma. In early 1949, the Burmese government arrested the Karen leader of the armed forces and replaced him with radical Burmese anti-Karen nationalist Ne Win. Continued attacks against Karen dominated townships around Rangoon and the arrest of Karen political leaders led the Karen national Union to declare armed struggle, and the world's longest running civil war began. Early in the fighting, Karen forces overran much of northern Burma including towns such as Mandalay and established strong positions outside Rangoon at Insein Township. But lacking a port from which to receive military supplies, the Karen forces gradually withdrew to the southeast of Burma. In 1976, the Karen National Union changed its policy on wanting an independent state, and joined a new alliance, the National Democratic Front. This alliance of armed ethnic political parties supported a federal union of Burma.Karen National Union website www.knuhq.org = 1990–2010 = In 1994 a group of Buddhist soldiers in the KNLA, claiming that the KNLA was unfairly dominated by Christians, broke away from the KNLA to form a new force, the DKBA, which soon organised a cease-fire with the Burmese military government. In 1995 KNLA lost Kawmoora and Myawaddy to the DKBA. This considerably reduced the KNLA's border trade taxation.

The DKBA had previously been allied to, but distinct from, government forces. In November 2010, following the general election of 2010, large parts of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army are alleged to have mutinied and re-aligned themselves with the KNLA, resulting in the escalating conflict with junta troops. The two rebel armies have formed an alliance, in advance of a possible crackdown by the military government. The KNLA, along with its parent organisation the KNU, signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with the government of Myanmar on 15 October 2015, along with several other insurgent groups. In September 2016, KNLA fighters began clashing with members of the Mon National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the New Mon State Party (NMSP), in the Tanintharyi Region. Both the KNU and NMSP were signatories of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) at the time of the fighting. A temporary bilateral truce was reached between the two groups on 14 March 2018.  Foreigners  A number of foreigners have gone to Myanmar to fight for the KNLA. Dave Everett, a former Australian SAS soldier, fought for the KNLA and was later arrested in Australia for trying to steal money to fund the KNLA.

Wizard was eventually released as part of the Atari Flashback 2 package in 2005. Gameplay The player is a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles imps in a maze. It's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. There is no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire is automatically sent in the direction of the enemy. The enemy remains invisible when it is behind a wall. It also has heart beat audio, which becomes louder as the player gets closer to the enemy. Production The production of Wizard is detailed extensively in the book Chris Crawford on Game Design. Crawford wanted to write software for the new Atari home computers, but Atari management required developers for the system to create an Atari VCS game first. Wizard was never released for the Atari VCS. It was first released on the Atari Flashback 2, 25 years after it was written. Its developer, Chris Crawford, was not even told about Wizard's eventual release on the Flashback 2, and learned about it in an email from a fan.

We say that the pair (X,A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has the homotopy extension property if, given a homotopy f_t\\\\colon A \\\\rightarrow Y and a map F_0\\\\colon X \\\\rightarrow Y such that F_0 |_A = f_0, there exists an extension of f_t to a homotopy F_t\\\\colon X \\\\rightarrow Y such that F_t|_A = f_t.A. Dold, Lectures on Algebraic Topology, pp. 84, Springer That is, the pair (X,A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has the homotopy extension property if any map G\\\\colon ((X\\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}) \\\\cup (A\\\\times I)) \\\\rightarrow Y can be extended to a map G'\\\\colon X\\\\times I \\\\rightarrow Y (i.e. G\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and G'\\\\,\\\\\\\\! agree on their common domain). If the pair has this property only for a certain codomain Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, we say that (X,A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has the homotopy extension property with respect to Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Visualisation The homotopy extension property is depicted in the following diagram center If the above diagram (without the dashed map) commutes (this is equivalent to the conditions above), then pair (X,A) has the homotopy extension property if there exists a map \\\\tilde{f} which makes the diagram commute. By currying, note that a map \\\\tilde{f} \\\\colon X \\\\to Y^I is the same as a map \\\\tilde{f} \\\\colon X\\\\times I \\\\to Y . Note that this diagram is dual to (opposite to) that of the homotopy lifting property; this duality is loosely referred to as Eckmann–Hilton duality. Properties * If X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a cell complex and A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a subcomplex of X\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then the pair (X,A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has the homotopy extension property. * A pair (X,A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has the homotopy extension property if and only if (X\\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup A\\\\times I) is a retract of X\\\\times I. Other If (X,A) has the homotopy extension property, then the simple inclusion map i\\\\colon A \\\\to X is a cofibration. In fact, if you consider any cofibration i\\\\colon Y \\\\to Z, then we have that \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{Y}} is homeomorphic to its image under \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{i}}. This implies that any cofibration can be treated as an inclusion map, and therefore it can be treated as having the homotopy extension property.

Between Corsica and Livorno, this diminutive island has been valued most for its wildlife, especially marine birds, and its isolation. The latter quality resulted in the foundation of Gorgona Abbey in the Middle Ages. After its closure the monastery grounds and buildings were appropriated in 1869, at the foundation of an agricultural penal colony, which is currently in use. Geography The village seen from the port. Gorgona is located about 19 nautical miles (about ) straight out from Livorno. It is a ferry ride of about 1.5 hours; however, access to the island is forbidden without permission from the Italian Ministry of Justice. It grants a standing concession exclusively to one group for supervised tours. Photographic equipment is not allowed. Private boats may approach the island no closer than except in emergencies. Capraia is away; Corsica, . The only landing place is \\"Cala dello Scalo\\", an inlet on the northeast side surrounded by cliffs, the site of the only beach. A fishing village over the beach is now inhabited by workers of the Penal Colony and, above all in the summer, by families of heirs of the old settlers. On the cliff overlooking the bay is a historic site, the Torre Nuova, \\"new tower\\", built as a watchtower by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the 17th century. From the beach an unpaved road leads up to the settlement at the head of a pass between the two prominent heights: Punta Gorgona at to the south and Punta Zirri at to the north. On the cliffs at the west side of the island on the other side of the pass is the Torre Vecchia, \\"old tower\\", built as a watchtower by the Republic of Pisa in the 12th century. Occupation of the island has been primarily on the steep slopes and terraces of the east coast. A number of monastery and other buildings were constructed there. The prison, which has been structured as a working farm, has taken over or takes responsibility for maintaining this entire region. Prisoners work in agriculture or raise animals or learn whatever building trades are useful to the enterprise. Their living space is rather big with good rooms as cells, some spaces for group activities and a pleasant soccer 5 field. Most of the prisoners work outdoors, in the village area too. So interaction with residents and outsiders is controlled. History =Ancient history= Urgon or Gorgòn (Γοργόν in Ancient Greek), believed to be Gorgona, receives brief mention in Pliny, who only states that it is near Pianosa and Capraia.Natural History, Book III, Section 81. Pomponius Mela had mentioned the name earlier (43 BC) but only as an item in a list of the islands in the vicinity.Book II section 7. =Monastic history= The old tower on the west coast. Rutilius Claudius Namatianus in describing his voyage of 417 AD in the region says that \\"Gorgon\\" rises up in the middle of the sea between the Pisan and Cyrniacan (Corsican) shores. Downloadable Google Books. He had already stated that there were monachi, \\"monks\\", on Capraia and now relates the story of an aristocratic youth who had given up wealth, status and the opportunity for marriage to retire to Gorgon in \\"superstitious exile\\", implying that monasteries of sorts were already on the two islands. Tradition holds that monks from Gorgona rescued the relics of Saint Julia of Corsica before they were carried to the mainland in the 8th century. Finally, in 1425, the Saint Julia relics were carried to Calci Chartreuse, near to Pisa. The monastery was abandoned after its destruction by the Saracens. In the 11th century the Republic of Pisa cleared the Tyrrhenian Sea of Muslims and proceeded against their strongholds in Africa. In 1051, just prior to the Pisan occupation of Corsica, the monastery was reconstituted, still Benedictine, and was declared under papal protection. Subsequently, gifts of land were made by aristocrats in Tuscany (where Pisa is located) and northern Corsica. The monastery began to keep land records from Corsica, the first known from there. Letter 130 of Catherine of Siena, a Dominican nun, to Ippolito degli Ubaldini of Florence encourages him to enter and contribute to the monastery of Gorgona. The letter in stating that the monastery needed to be refurbished to conform to the \\"rule of the Carthusian Order\\" implies that it was recently converted to that order. It must have been written after her vision of 1375 and visit to the island then. Two inscriptions at Pisa Charterhouse at Calci attribute the change of order to the influence of Catherine on Pope Gregory XI in trying to obtain economic assistance for the Carthusians. The pope made a grant of money and gave the Carthusians Gorgona. The change cast reproach on the Benedictines for their alleged non-monastic way of life. They were asked to leave the island and were banned from it. Carthusians from Pisa Charterhouse retenanted the monastery under Don Bartholomew Serafini. He promptly invited Catherine to visit. She lodged outside the monastery but was invited to address the monks. She spoke on resisting the temptations of Satan. The mantle she was asked to leave as a token of the visit placed later in the hands of a young monk tempted to suicide by the death or illness of his mother is said to have removed all temptation, a token, in the church, of her sainthood.Drane, pages 318-319. Subsequently, the Mediterranean became politically unstable. Fearing an attack by Saracen corsairs the monks left the island for the charterhouse at Calci in 1425, taking all the records and works of art with them, and never returned. The records were duly published at Pisa. The island however remained in the ownership of Pisa Charterhouse until the 18th century. =Modern history= Early in 1771 Peter Leopold I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, purchased Gorgona from the Carthusians of Pisa with the intent of making it part of a plan for economic revival. In March of that year he passed a law opening the island to settlement by fishermen with the proviso that they would catch and cure anchovies and sell them in Livorno. The fishing village dates to this time. This opportunity to live in Gorgona was raised from the families named \\"Citti\\" and \\"Dodoli\\", coming from Garfagnana region in province of Lucca. These two families worked hard to make Gorgona a good place to live in, being able to stay there until the present day. With the unification of Italy in 1861, including the former Grand Duchy of Tuscany, ownership of Gorgona passed to the new Kingdom of Italy. Gorgona became a new and experimental agricultural penal colony in 1869. Literature Island of Gorgona, with Capraia too, is part of one of the best-known verses of Dante Alighieri's poem La Divina Commedia: Ecology The ecology of Gorgona is under the protection of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park, dating from 1996, with headquarters at Portoferraio, Elba. Most of the island is in its native state, 90% of it being forested with maquis, to high. Among its plant species are Arbutus unedo, Rhamnus (Buckthorn), Pistacia lentiscus, Juniperus phoenicea, Myrtus communis, Erica arborea, Erica scoparia, Rosmarinus officinalis, Phillyrea angustifolia, and Phillyrea latifolia. The flowers in more open country include Lavandula stoechas, Helichrysum italicum, Cistus incanus, Cistus salvifolius, and Cistus monspeliensis. Calycotome spinosa and Spartium junceum appear on the slopes. Linaria capraria is endemic to the archipelago and to Gorgona too. Evergreens predominate. There are groves of holm-oak, the remnant of a prehistoric forest, and pine woods of Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinea, and Pinus pinaster. Gorgona is one of only five islands in the world on which the Corsican finch is found. Economy In the nineteenth century the island was famous for its anchovies. Reservation by the Italian government reduced all economy to that of the prison until last year. In 2012 the Department of Justice approved and gave finances to a plan called \\"Progetto Granducato\\" (Granducato Project), to reach the goal of giving prisoners professional training and real job opportunies, inviting private investors to start enterprises in Gorgona. The first company getting a business agreement with the prison's management, was the world-famous wine producer \\"Marchesi de' Frescobaldi\\". So nowadays the oldest and more prestigious wine brand of Tuscany, is giving prisoners of Gorgona the chance to get an exceptional know-how grown in the centuries, to make their own wines Vermentino and Ansonica, extra virgin olive oil and any other farm goods.

His first name is sometimes spelled as \\"Phillip\\". 1996–98 Philip Boit and his compatriot Henry Bitok were trained in Finland in order to become competitive skiers. Both were former middle distance runners with no previous skiing experience. Their project was sponsored by sportswear giant Nike. Their winter training began in February 1996. Kenya had only one slot for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, which was taken by Philip Boit, while Henry Bitok finished his skiing career soon afterward. Boit's participation in the games gained worldwide media coverage. He finished 92nd and last in the 10-kilometer classic race. The awards for the race were delayed while the winner Bjørn Dæhlie waited for Boit to reach the finish line in order to hug him. The experience was so moving for Boit that he named one of his sons Dæhlie Boit. 1999 Boit participated in the 1999 Nordic skiing World Championships in Ramsau, Austria, and again finished last in the 10 km classic event. After the event Nike dropped their sponsorship, hence he had to settle for \\"dry training\\" in Kenya for over two years. 2002–10 In the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City Boit finished 64th in the sprint race, beating three competitors. After the Salt Lake City Olympics Boit left competitive skiing again, but came back to participate in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin where he finished 92nd in the 15 km Classic, ahead of five fellow competitors. Boit said in a 2006 interview that he was planning to retire after 2010 Winter Olympics to be held in Vancouver. In 2007, he competed in the World Ski Championships held in Sapporo, Japan, the same country where he started his Olympic career. 2010–11 Boit had planned to retire after the 2010 Winter Olympics. However, he did not meet the requirements needed to start in the Games as he missed the limit by two FIS points. His attempts to qualify for the Olympics had been hampered by illness. After missing the Olympics, Boit decided to continue his career by a year and retire after the 2011 World Championships to be held in Oslo, Norway.Daily Nation, February 22, 2010: Boit back after Olympic disappointment Boit finished 42nd during qualification, and therefore was unable to compete in the 15 kilometre classical. Education After graduating from Samwayi Secondary School, he was recruited to General Service Unit in 1992, where was able to enhance his athletics career. As an athlete, he was a bit behind the top Kenyan runners. His 800 meter personal best is 1:46.06.

Early life Stiebeling was born in Haskins, Ohio in 1896, on a farm, where her interest in food and nutrition is thought to have developed. In high school she studied domestic science. Education After high school, Stiebeling enrolled in a two year program in domestic science at Skidmore College. She is said to have discovered Dr. Henry Sherman's book, \\"The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition,\\" in the college's library and to have been inspired by it. After graduating from Skidmore, Stiebeling was employed for three years as a schoolteacher and then she entered the Columbia University Teachers' College where she was an assistant in Foods and Nutrition under Professor Mary Swartz Rose. She graduated with a BS in 1919, and then completed an MA in nutrition in 1924. Stiebeling became a research fellow under Dr. Henry Sherman at the Graduate School of Columbia University after receiving her MA. Her research was in the basal metabolism of women, the influence of vitamin D on calcium deposition in bone, the nutritional value of protein in human subjects, and others projects. She was awarded a PhD in chemistry in 1928. Her thesis was on a method for studying the content of vitamins A and D in tissues. In 1930, after graduation from the PhD program, she was hired as Head of the new Section on Food Economics at the USDA Bureau of Home Economics. There, she conducted an extensive investigation of the nutritional value of US diets that has continued until the present day (2005). Notable scientific contributions Hazel Stiebeling developed a USDA publication on diet planning in 1933 that is the first known publication to include the term \\"dietary allowances\\". It was the first quantitative national dietary standard for the minerals calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A and C. The values were based on her research in the Sherman laboratory. In 1939 Stiebeling worked with Esther Phipard to include USDA dietary allowances for thiamine and riboflavin. Their proposal for recognizing some variance between individuals in a population also stimulated an \\"allowance of a margin of 50% above the average minimum for normal maintenance [...] an estimate intended to cover individual variations of minimal nutritional need among apparently normal people.\\" This technique has been the standard for developing dietary plans by international organizations like the FAO and the WHO.

Lying at the center of the Suquamish winter village on Agate Pass, just south of the present-day town of Suquamish, it was home to Chief Sealth (Chief Seattle) and Chief Kitsap. History The name of the site in Lushootseed was D'Suq'Wub (dxʷsuqʼʷabš), meaning \\"clear salt water,\\" and is the source of the name of the Suquamish people. The name \\"Old Man House\\" comes from the Chinook Jargon word \\"oleman\\" meaning \\"old, worn out\\",Shaw, George Coombs. The Chinook jargon and how to use it. Rainier Printing Company, inc., 1909. p. 18. but also meaning \\"from the old times\\". \\"House\\" in the Chinook Jargon referred to any kind of building, or even to individual rooms within them. Archeological investigations have revealed that the village site was occupied for at least 2000 years. Accounts vary as to when the longhouse itself was constructed; many sources indicate it was built in the late 18th or early 19th century, but it might have been built earlier. Reports of the longhouse's size also vary, putting its length between 600 and 1000 feet (approximately 200–300 m). The lands around Old Man House were retained by the Suquamish tribe after the Point Elliott Treaty was signed in 1855, becoming the Port Madison Indian Reservation. However, the longhouse was burned by the U.S. government in 1870, after Seattle's death. The destruction of the longhouse was intended to encourage the Suquamish to spread out across their reservation and take up farming. After it was burned, the Suquamish rebuilt their village at the site and continued to live there. In 1886 the federal government divided the reservation into allotments which were assigned to individual Suquamish families. In 1904 the U.S. War Department acquired land along Agate Pass, including the site of Old Man House, to build fortifications to protect the new naval shipyards at Bremerton. The village site had to be moved, and the tribe lost much of its water access. The fortifications were never built, and the land purchased by the military was eventually sold in 1937 to a private developer and subdivided for vacation homes. In 1950, the Washington Parks and Recreation Department purchased an acre of waterfront where Old Man House had been located and set it aside as a state park. The park was returned to the Suquamish Tribe on August 12, 2004.

H. Auden written between 1940 and 1942. Auden's original title was \\"Three Songs for St. Cecilia's Day\\", and he later published the poem as \\"Anthem for St. Cecilia’s Day (for Benjamin Britten)\\". For a long time Britten wanted to write a piece dedicated to St Cecilia for a number of reasons. Firstly, he was born on St Cecilia's day; secondly, St Cecilia is the patron saint of music; and finally, there is a long tradition in England of writing odes and songs to St Cecilia. The most famous of these are by John Dryden (\\"A song for St. Cecilia's Day\\" 1687) and musical works by Henry Purcell, Hubert Parry, E. Florence Whitlock, and George Frideric Handel. Another briefer work by Herbert Howells has the similar title A Hymn for St Cecilia, but was written later in 1960. The first extant reference to Britten's desire to write such a work is from 1935 when Britten wrote in his diary \\"I’m having great difficulty in finding Latin words for a proposed Hymn to St Cecilia. Spend morning hunting.\\"Britten diary, 19 January 1935: published in Journeying Boy, ed. John Evans (2009): p. 244 Britten first met Auden later that year, and subsequently worked with him on a number of large- scale works, including the operetta Paul Bunyan (1941). Britten asked that Auden provide him a text for his ode to St Cecilia, and Auden complied, sending the poem in sections throughout 1940, along with advice on how Britten could be a better artist. This was to be one of the last works they collaborated on. According to Britten's partner Peter Pears in 1980 \\"Ben was on a different track now, and he was no longer prepared to be dominated – bullied – by Wystan, whose musical feeling he was very well aware of. ...Perhaps he may have been said to have said goodbye to working with Wystan with his marvelous setting of the Hymn (Anthem) to St. Cecilia.\\" Britten began setting Hymn to St. Cecilia in the United States, certainly in June 1941 when a performance by the newly formed Elizabethan Singers was projected to take place in New York sometime later that year.Mitchell (1991): p. 1039 In 1942 (the midst of World War II) Britten and Pears decided to return home to England. The customs inspectors confiscated all of Britten's manuscripts, fearing they could be some type of code. Britten re-wrote the manuscript while aboard the MS Axel Johnson, and finished it on 2 April 1942. It was written at the same time as A Ceremony of Carols, which shares the same affect. The text itself follows in the tradition of odes, including an invocation to the muse: \\"Blessed Cecilia/Appear in visions to all musicians/Appear and inspire\\". Britten uses this as a refrain throughout piece, whereas it is the last portion of Auden's first section. The piece is in three sections, plus three iterations of the refrain, with slight variations, following each section. The first section is very similar to the refrain, couched in the E Phrygian scale and with the same melody. The second section is a scherzo with a modified fugue form. The third section is more lyrical, with solos in each voice describing a different instrument, traditional in odes to St. Cecilia. The hymn was given its first (radio) performance in 1942.Hyperion Program Notes by Rupert Gough, 2014. Notes References *Britten, Benjamin. Hymn to St. Cecilia. Op. 27.

The team the USVI sent to Turin consisted of a single luger, Anne Abernathy. She was the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. In the closing ceremony, she intended to carry her red racing helmet in one hand, saying \\"Women of 50 all over the world can participate in life ... I’m passionate about my sport … I’m not over the hill.\\" Luge Anne Abernathy was the oldest female competitor at these Games. Anne Abernathy, known by the nickname \\"Grandma Luge\\", was 52 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics. Abernathy was the oldest female athlete at these Olympics. About her age, she said, \\"It's a big deal for a lot of women that someone over 50 is going out there and doing it.\\" She had represented the Virgin Islands at the five proceeding Winter Olympics. She was forced out of the women's singles competition due to a broken wrist suffered in her fifth training run on 12 February. Initially left off the start list entirely, a three-judge panel of the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on 17 February 2006 that she should officially be recorded as \\"Did Not Start\\". The other female lugers gifted her a signed start number 31, with Michelle Despain of Argentina writing \\"Thank you for your example, Anne.\\" In the competition, the Germans swept the medals; Sylke Otto won gold; Silke Kraushaar-Pielach took the silver, and Tatjana Hüfner won the bronze.

The series revolves around a golden hamster named Freddy Auratus, two silly guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso, a black, civilized tomcat named Sir William, and Freddy's owner, Mr. John, who translates German to English. All mammals (except humans) in this series communicate in Interanimal, a telepathic language. The only animal that can read and write is Freddy. He goes on adventures with his friends Sir William, Enrico, Caruso, and Tjark. Characters * Freddy Auratus is a smart, golden hamster that can read and write, but only with a keyboard. He can talk in Interanimal, and other pets often ask him to type something to Mr. John for them. * Enrico and Caruso, Enrico is a smaller guinea pig, while Caruso is a larger one, often taunt Freddy by saying guinea pigs are superior to golden hamsters. They enjoy singing songs, writing plays, and making animals laugh. They are named after the famous opera singer, Enrico Caruso. * Sir William is a 'respectable' tom cat that says he will not kill an animal for food. He also always makes laws for the other pets to obey and is loyal to Mr. John. However, later in the series, Sir William catches mice. * Mr. John, a human who takes care of all the pets, can understand Freddy by the words the hamster types on his computer. * Tjark, first appearing in the fifth book, is a robotic hamster that was built by Goldoni, an Italian scientist.

WECS began in the 1970s as a turntable mounted in a 3x4' square of plywood which sat atop a work sink in a janitor's closet in an old dormitory. This was not a licensed station. It ran at approximately 10 watts and was a pirate broadcaster. At the time, Eastern Connecticut State University was not yet accredited as a university. In the late 1970s, a movement was afoot to get a legitimate radio station for the communications department. This was orchestrated by former WCBS announcer Prof. John Zatowski. By 1982, test broadcasts had begun, and by 1984, WECS-FM was on air. In the succeeding decades, a number of long-time DJs have come and gone: Joe Standby, Bash, Robbo Retro, Alf (\\"The Alternative Xperience\\"), Mark E.

The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The disease belongs to a family of hamartomatous polyposis syndromes, which also includes Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis and Cowden syndrome. Mutation of the PTEN gene underlies this syndrome, as well as Cowden syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome, these four syndromes are referred to as PTEN Hamartoma-Tumor Syndromes. Signs and symptoms Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome is associated with enlarged head and benign mesodermal hamartomas (multiple hemangiomas, and intestinal polyps). Dysmorphy as well as delayed neuropsychomotor development can also be present.update 2016 The head enlargement does not cause widening of the ventricles or raised intracranial pressure; these individuals have a higher risk of developing tumors, as the gene involved in BRRs is phosphatase and tensin homologue. Some individuals have thyroid issues consistent with multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, differentiated non-medullary thyroid cancer, most lesions are slowly growing. Visceral as well as intracranial involvement may occur in some cases, and can cause bleeding and symptomatic mechanical compression Genetics PTEN The genetics of the Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome is determined, in the majority of cases, via the PTEN gene which presents about 30 mutations in this condition. This gene which regulates cell growth, when not working properly can lead to hamartomas. PTEN chromosomal location is 10q23.31, while the molecular location is 87,863,438 to 87,971,930 There are many syndromes that are linked to PTEN aside from Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba Syndrome. The syndrome combines Bannayan–Zonana syndrome, Riley–Smith syndrome, and Ruvalcaba–Myhre–Smith syndrome. Bannayan–Zonana syndrome is named for George A. Bannayan and Jonathan Zonana Diagnosis In terms of diagnosing Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome there is no current method outside the physical characteristics that may be present as signs/symptoms. There are, however, multiple molecular genetics tests (and cytogenetic test) to determine Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome. =Differential diagnosis= The differential diagnosis for BRRS consists of the following: Treatment Kidney In terms of treatment/management one should observe what signs or symptoms are present and therefore treat those as there is no other current guideline.

The purpose of the society was to bolster public support for the Union effort, by disseminating pro-Union news articles and editorials to newspapers around the country. There were two such societies: the Loyal Publication Society of New York and the Boston-based New England Loyal Publication Society, both founded in early 1863. These two organizations were similar to the Union Leagues that cropped up throughout the North, in that they provided civilians an opportunity to support the war effort. The Union League of Philadelphia was also involved in the development of pro-Union publications. The founders and members represented the literary and financial elite of Boston and New York. In New York, they included such luminaries as Charles King, president of Columbia University, Sinclair Tousey, president of the American News Company, the publisher George Palmer Putnam, the German-born academic Francis Lieber, and the future vice-president of the United States Levi P. Morton. In Boston, the members included Charles Eliot Norton, the Harvard Professor and prominent cultural critic, John Murray Forbes, a railroad magnate, and James Bradley Thayer, who was to become one of the country's foremost legal scholars. In their first months, these groups would share the responsibility of reading newspapers to identify particularly useful articles and editorials. They would then contact the editors—before the type had been broken up—and request that additional copies of that particular item be printed. These items would then be distributed to Union soldiers or to newspapers. As the war progressed, the societies began to write and publish their own broadsides, which included contributions from well-known persons such as Robert Dale Owen.

Development Great Harbour Cay underwent a period in intense and successful development in the late 1960s when famous persons such as Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks, Brigitte Bardot, ,The Rat Pack vacationed there along with Telly Savalas who had his own landing pad (Kojak) for his helicopter, F. Lee Bailey frequented with his helicopter & spent early morning at the beach hut enjoying a cup of coffee, Francis Shields was rumored to live on the island though never seen even after development slowed and then stopped in the late 1970s. Attempts were made in the late 1970s into the early 1980s to revitalize Great Harbour Cay; but these were overshadowed by drug and weapons traffic in 1983, resident 79-85 source (Book: Drugs, Law Enforcement And Foreign Policy - Report by the Committee on Foreign Relations, US Senate), and the island has been quiet since. The recently elected Bahamian government has made an effort to revive the tourism industry, especially on the outer islands, and great progress and interest has been rekindled in the smaller islands. Combined with the 9-hole golf course designed by Joe Lee and constructed by Golf Force, the full-service marina, and other island attractions of fishing and diving, the island looks set for a surge in development. Certain actions in recent years, including repaving of the airport and all major roads, have led to increased interest in the island. The planned renovation of the water supply has not occurred, but has not had a major impact due to the large aquifer under the island and the widespread use of wells. There is only a small hotel on the island, catering principally to Bahamians, meaning lodging for tourists is limited to rental townhouses and single-family homes. There has been a rumor of a new hotel yet to be confirmed. =Sugar Beach Hotel= Sugar Beach Hotel, a frequent haunt of the rich and famous, is now deserted. In the late 1970s, the Sugar Beach Hotel was operational as an entertainment facility for cruise ships. Dinghies would bring passengers ashore to listen to a band and dance. =Bullock's Harbour= Access from Great Harbour Cay to Bullocks Harbour was over a manual crank bridge: Bullocks Harbour & Great Harbour are separated by an ocean inlet and tall cliffs. In the late 1970s, there was one building that served as a health facility, post office, and operator-assisted telephone. Across the street, there was an old home converted into a schoolhouse. There was one grocery store with live chickens and two bars known as the Chicken Coop & The Grave Yard. Resident 79-85 source =Shark Creek= Shark Creek, the southernmost point of the island, is a popular shark fishing spot . A Great Hammerhead was reputedly caught off the coast near Ag point. The hammerhead in question was long known to be in the area and was documented to be over long. The shark has not been seen nor reported since being tagged in 2002. Manatees A female manatee and her mate were discovered in the harbour in December 1999. The manatee was nicknamed 'Manny', and was believed to have strayed from the Florida coast after a tropical storm or Hurricane in 1999. A young boy named Michael Morris documented a swim with the manatee on film. Its mate was rumoured to have spent many months around Great Harbour, but then became solitary once again leaving the female behind, who is believed to have had a calf some time in 2000. In 2012, rescued manatee were brought from Atlantis to the island, where they quickly were accepted by the already present group. Dolphins Dolphins are known to swim by the harbour close to shore from time to time. Transportation The island is served by Great Harbour Cay Airport.

History The Roman bridge of Chaves constructed during the era Vespasian and Trajan The commemorative columns that mark the bridge and Roman settlement in Aquae Flaviae The northwest peninsular region is an area of hot springs and Roman settlements linked to the exploitation of valuable natural resources.Diana Fonseca Sorribas (2012), p.519 Aquae Flaviae was the principal municipium civitas in the northwest (from epigraphic findings) implanted in the Trás-os-Montes, on a small hill on the banks of the River Tâmega, in the Roman province of Gallaecia. This was a fertile area, where hot springs abound, in addition to a mining region from which gold is extracted. It is also located in a strategic place between the Roman cities of Bracara and Asturica, as well as the mining districts of Três Minas and Jales, located southwest of the civitates. Little is known of the urban fabric although there are some important points: an aqueduct supplied water from a reservoir and dam in Abobeleira, there was a theatre/amphitheatre, vestiges of a necropolis and sections of a wall.Diana Fonseca Sorribas (2012), p.520 With respect to the thermal activity, the lack of archaeological excavations means that little is known as of the alleged ancient Roman baths. Modern excavations have begun to uncover the remains of another Roman baths structure associated with a hot spring in Largo do Arrabalde consisting of large pavement slabs and a block of opus caementicium associated with a thermal spring. These are the first known thermal remains known to be located within Chaves. Further, within the civitates there are many complicated votive epigraphs which seem to relate to thermal worship. There are two inscriptions dedicated to nymphs, a lost inscription dedicated to Tutela and another to Isis, that suggest a thermal cult. Architecturally, the most notable feature of this city, is the bridge of Trajan over the Tâmega River, whose existence marked a period of exceptional development of the city. Functioning as a crossroads, it controlled the routes to the mining districts. The remains of two epigraphic inscriptions are located on the bridge, commemorating the construction or remodelling by Emperor Trajan, as well as another that aroused various interpretations, the Padrão dos Povos. The Padrão dos Povos mentions the civitates dependant of Aquae Flaviae: Aquiflavienses, Avobrigenses, Bibali, Coelerni, Equaesi, Interamici, Limici, Naebisoci, Querquerni and Tamagani, as well as the Roman Legio VII Gemina Felix legion. Aquae Flaviae was founded by Rome, although the details of that founding remain obscure. Ptolemy suggests that it was founded in Turodi territory, a theory that has been strengthened by the existence of epigraphic evidence documenting the presence of Turodi.Diana Fonseca Sorribas (2012), p.521  References  =Notes= =Sources= * Chaves, Portugal Catholic titular sees in Europe Roman towns and cities in Portugal de:Aquae Flaviae it:Aquae Flaviae ","title":"Aquae Flaviae"},{"id":"4029639","text":"Sarah Edwards Charlesworth (March 29, 1947 – June 25, 2013) was an American conceptual artist and photographer. She is considered part of The Pictures Generation, a loose-knit group of artists working in New York in the late 1970s and early 1980s, all of whom were concerned with how images shape our everyday lives and society as a whole. Early life and education Charlesworth was born in East Orange, New Jersey. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Barnard College in 1969. Her undergraduate thesis project, a work of conceptual art devoid of text, was a 50-print study of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.Sarah Charlesworth Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Prior to that she studied under Douglas Huebler at Bradford College. After completing her degree, she studied briefly under the photographer Lisette Model at The New School. After college, she worked as a freelance photographer and became active in downtown Manhattan art circles.Katya Kazakina (June 29, 2013), Sarah Charlesworth Leaves Magic Images, Beloved Garden Bloomberg. Personal life Charlesworth had two children with her former husband, filmmaker Amos Poe; Nicholas T. Poe (b. 1985) and Sarah-Lucy C. Poe (b. 1988). Work Charlesworth worked in photographic series, but stated in a 1990 interview that she had not really thought of herself as a photographer. She stated, rather, that she viewed her work as investigating questions about the world and her role in it, but realized as of that point that she had been investigating those questions through the medium of photography for the past twelve years. In 1975, Charlesworth and fellow conceptual artists Michael Corris, Preston Heller, Joseph Kosuth, Andrew Menard, and Mel Ramsden founded The Fox, a magazine dedicated to art theory, but the magazine only remained in publication until 1976. Along with Glenn O'Brien, Betsy Sussler, Liza Bear, and Michael McClard, she co-founded BOMB magazine in 1981.McClister, Nell. \\"BOMB Magazine: Celebrating 25 Years\\", BOMB, Retrieved 13 October 2014. Charlesworth also created the cover art for the very first edition of BOMB magazine. Charlesworth worked in series, exploring one idea to its conclusion.Christopher Knight (April 22, 1998), An Artist Taking Pictures (Literally) Los Angeles Times. For a series called Modern History (1977–79), she photographed, at actual size, the front pages of 29 American and Canadian newspapersRoberta Smith (June 25, 2015), Review: ‘Sarah Charlesworth: Doubleworld’ Studies Perceptions Shaped by Photography New York Times. and blanked out everything except for their photographs and mastheads.Smith, Roberta (June 30, 2013). Sarah Charlesworth, Artist of Deconstructed Photographs, Dies at 66, The New York Times. Retrieved July 1, 2013. For Movie-Television-News-History (1979), a part of the series, Charlesworth selected a specific event – the shooting of American journalist Bill Stewart by the Nicaraguan National Guard – and presented it as it was reported on June 21, 1979, in 27 American newspapers. All images in the final work were printed at the same size as the original newspapers.Lucy Gallun (November 15, 2013), Unwriting: Sarah Charlesworth Museum of Modern Art, New York. In February 1980, Charlesworth created Stills, a series of harrowing, six-and-a-half-foot- tall photographs depicting bodies falling from buildings.Sarah Charlesworth: Stills, September 18, 2014 - January 4, 2015 Art Institute of Chicago. When Stills was first shown in 1980 in Tony Shafrazi's East Village apartment, it consisted of seven images. To create the series, Charlesworth scoured news wires and the archives of the New York Public Library for images of people plunging through the air, having jumped out of a windows to commit suicide or because of a catastrophe like fire. After appropriating the photograph, she would crop or tear it, often leaving the edges ragged so that it appeared to be haphazardly torn like a homemade clipping. She would then rephotograph the image and enlarge it. Charlesworth later expanded the series, printing an eighth work from her original source material in 2009 and – as a commission of the Art Institute of Chicago – creating a set of six new ones from the original transparencies that were never printed. Each gelatin silver print was made and mounted to the exact specifications of those she created in 1980.Carol Vogel (September 12, 2014), Hurtling Bodies, Frozen in Time: ‘Stills,’ by Sarah Charlesworth New York Times. In her \\"Objects of Desire\\" series (1983–1988), Cibachrome prints of appropriated images – typically a cutout picture of a single object, including a gold bowl and a statue of a Buddha – are photographed against bright, laminated monochrome backgrounds that match their lacquered frames.Deborah Solomon (June 26, 2015), Recalling Sarah Charlesworth’s Photographs New York Times. In the series Renaissance Paintings and Renaissance Drawings (both 1991), Charlesworth combined imagery from disparate Italian Renaissance paintings and drawings to make new, often ironic paintings and drawings. Charlesworth began to photograph actual objects only in the early 1990s. Her series The Academy of Secrets is Charlesworth's attempt to convey her emotions through using abstracted images of objects that have symbolic associations. She illustrated how the way light falls on objects affects our perceptions of them as the subject of her own 2012 solo exhibition Available Light. Charlesworth held various teaching positions at New York University, the School of Visual Arts, and Hartford University. Before her death she taught Master Critique in the MFA Photography, Video and Related Media Program and The School of Visual Arts. A major influence on a new generation of artists, including Sara VanDerBeek and Liz Deschenes, she was appointed to the faculty of Princeton University in 2012.Sarah Charlesworth, Lewis Center for the Arts Princeton University. Death She lived and worked both in New York City and in Falls Village, Connecticut, at the time of her death. Charlesworth died of a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2013, at the age of 66. Exhibitions Charlesworth's work was the subject of more than 40 solo exhibitions at venues including the Centre d'art contemporain, Geneva (1977), the Queens Museum of Art, New York (1992), and the Art Institute of Chicago (2014). A 1998 survey organized by SITE Santa Fe in Santa Fe, New Mexico, toured to four additional museums. Her work was included in the Whitney Biennial (1985) and the Venice Biennale (1986). In 1995, she cocurated Somatogenies at New York's Artists Space with fellow artists Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons.

Published by ImpreMedia, the paper covers local, national and international news with an emphasis on Latin America, as well as human- interest stories, politics, business and technology, health, entertainment, and sports. El Diario Nueva York currently has 294,769 daily readers and 676,570 unique readers each week. Online, it reaches over 5 million users monthly, and it has more than 800,000 followers in social networks. The paper's offices are located on the 7th floor of 15 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, New York City. History The newspaper was created in 1963 through the merger of El Diario de Nueva York (established 1947) and La Prensa (established as a weekly in 1913 by Rafael Viera and converted into a daily in 1918 when acquired by José Camprubí) when both were purchased by O. Roy Chalk. In 1981, Chalk sold the newspaper to Gannett Company, in a deal valued at $10 million. The paper's publisher, Carlos D. Ramirez, and his investment group El Diario Associates, purchased the paper in 1989 from Gannett for a price just over $20 million. The paper had been unprofitable for two or three years and circulation had declined from a peak of 80,000 to under 70,000. With the addition of new technology and improved journalism, Ramirez was able to increase circulation to 68,000 by the time of his death in 1999 and to return the paper to profitability. Under his leadership, the paper won as Best Hispanic Daily from the National Hispanic Publishers Association. El Diario Associates joined in 1995 with Latin Communications Group, a firm that operates 18 radio stations, with Ramirez running the business's print division and serving on the board. El Diario Nueva York merged with the Los Angeles- based La Opinión in 2004 to form ImpreMedia. La Opinión is the largest Spanish-language newspaper publisher in the United States. The newspaper has won many awards from the National Association of Hispanic Publications. In 2005, its awards included first place for editorial writing, political and cultural reporting, and feature writing. El Diario's chief competitor is Hoy, a Spanish-language daily with 180,000 readers in New York. However, on February 12, 2007, ImpreMedia announced its purchase of the Hoy New York edition from the Tribune Company. In 2010, long-term journalist Vicky Peláez, whose writings were critical of United States foreign policy and supportive of Latin American leaders Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro, was arrested for working for Russia. The \\"Illegals Program\\" was a part of Russian influence operations. In 2013, it celebrated its 100 years with a party at Grand Central Station in New York City.

This storied organization was founded in 1967 when the local teams were struggling to find talented kids to play football. Since 1967, this organization has taken part in 35+ provincial championship games and won 37 of them. About North Shore football The North Shore Football League plays host to teams for children aged 6–13. The different age groups are Atom (6-9 year olds), Mosquito (10-11 year olds), PeeWee (12-13 year olds), Bantam (14-15 year olds) and Midget (16-17 year olds). The first three (Atom, Mosquito and PeeWee) are hosted through a series of parks. The Bantam Lions play in Quebec Bantam Football League's (QBFL) Bill Allan division which is the Bantam AAA first division. The Midget Mustangs play in Quebec Midget Football League's (QMFL) Bruno Heppell division which is the Midget AAA division. Team history In the early to mid-1960s, the North Shore Football League was still in its infancy and at the time there were four bantam teams that played amongst themselves in a house-league system. The names that were chosen for these teams were taken from the western teams in the CFL. These were the Eskimos, Stampeders, Bombers, and Lions, who, at the time, were playing their home games at Rive Boisée park. As it was becoming increasingly difficult to find enough players to make four bantam teams, a decision was made in 1966 to disband the four-team system and to create one elite team that was going to compete the following year at the inter-city level in the fledgling Metropolitan Bantam Football League (MBFL). They still needed to come up with a name for the team so it was decided that whichever of the four existing teams won what would be the last North Shore championship that year, their name would be used for the new inter-city team that was to begin competing the following year in 1967. As it happened, the Lions won that last championship and this was the creation of the team that we now know today. In their inaugural season, under the guidance of their first head coach, Ron Hutchison, they began what was to become a winning streak of 42 straight games without a loss and their first of many provincial championship titles. In 1980, the MBFL fell into the jurisdiction of the Quebec Amateur Football Federation (QAFF) and changed to what we now know as the Quebec Bantam Football League (QBFL). The original MBFL championship trophy was retired and was presented by Bill Allan, then president of the MBFL and founding father of the North Shore Football League, to the Lions for having won the most championships during the time the MBFL existed.

The history of Quebec City extends back thousands of years, with its first inhabitants being the First Nations peoples of the region. The arrival of French explorers in the 16th century eventually led to the establishment of Quebec City, in present-day Quebec, Canada. The city is one of the oldest European settlements in North America, with the establishment of a permanent trading post in 1608. French rule Jacques Cartier's meeting with the indigenous people of Stadacona in 1535. Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, was the first European to ascend the St. Lawrence Gulf, claiming \\"Canada\\" for France (and the coming addition of a newly founded \\"Acadie\\" – known today as the Province of Nova Scotia) to create a dominion known as New France. Cartier and his crew first visited in the 1535 an Iroquois settlement of 500 persons called Stadacona, in a site located in present-day Quebec City.Bumsted, J. M. Canada's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. 35. He came back in 1541 with some 400 persons to establish Fort Charlesbourg-Royal, the earliest known French settlement in North America (whose site is located in the former town of Cap-Rouge, which merged into Quebec City in 2002). The fort was abandoned a year later in large part due to the hostility of the natives combined with the harsh winter. After 1543 there were still fur trading activities in the area but it was only 60 years later, on 3 July 1608, that Quebec City (intended as a permanent trading post) was established, on the top and on the foot of Cape Diamant by Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua de Mons. By the time Champlain came to this site, the Iroquois population had disappeared and been replaced by Innu and Algonquins. Champlain and his crew built a wooden fort which they called \\"l'habitation\\" within only a few days of their arrival.. One of the strategic advantage of the site was its relative isolation from the competition of other traders active downstream in the Gulf area, as well as its promontory from which could be observed any vessel going further upstream into the continent The word \\"Kebec\\" is an Algonquin word meaning \\"where the river narrows.\\"Conrick, Maeve, and Vera Regan. French in Canada: Language Issues. Oxford: Peter Lang, 2007. 11-12. In 1620, Champlain built Fort Saint- Louis on the top of Cape Diamond, near the present location of the Chateau Frontenac. The town was briefly taken by English troops during the surrender of Quebec, from 1629 to 1632, after which it was returned to France. When the French returned, they noticed that most buildings had been destroyed. The reconstruction started a year later, and Charles de Montmagny, the first governor, was eventually dispatched in the town to oversee the development of the colony =Demographics and population= Samuel de Champlain overseeing the construction of the Habitation de Québec, in 1608. After the settlement of Port Royal in Acadia (1605), the next colonization effort by the French occurred in 1608. Samuel de Champlain built \\"l'Habitation\\" to house 28 people. However, the first winter proved formidable, and 20 of 28 men died. By 1615, the first four missionaries arrived in Quebec. Among the first successful French settlers were Marie Rollet and her husband, Louis Hébert, credited as \\"les premier agriculteurs du Canada\\" by 1617. The first French child born in Quebec was Helene Desportes, in 1620, to Pierre Desportes and Francoise Langlois, whose father was a member of the Hundred Associates. The population of Quebec City arrived at 100 in 1627, less than a dozen of whom were women. However, with the invasion of Quebec by David Kirke and his brothers in 1628, Champlain returned to France with approximately 60 out of 80 settlers. When the French returned to Quebec in 1632, they constructed a city based on the framework of a traditional French \\"ville\\" in which \\"the 17th century city was a reflection of its society.\\" Quebec remained an outpost until well into the 1650s. As in other locations throughout New France, the population could be split into the colonial elites, including clergy and government officials, the craftsmen and artisans, and the engagés (indentured servants). Quebec was designed so that the inhabitants of better quality lived in the upper city, closer to the centers of power such as the government and Jesuit college, whereas the lower town was primarily populated by merchants, sailors and artisans. The city contained only about thirty homes in 1650, and one hundred by 1663, for a population of over 500. Jean Bourdon, the first engineer and surveyor of New France, helped plan the city, almost from his arrival in 1634.Serge Courville and Robert Gagnon, Québec, ville et capital, Sainte-Foy: Université de Laval, 2001. 52. However, despite attempts to utilize urban planning, the city quickly outgrew its planned area. Population continually increased, with the city boasting 1300 inhabitants by 1681. The city quickly experienced overcrowding, especially in the lower town, which contained two- thirds of the population of the city by 1700. The numbers became more evenly distributed by 1744, with the lower town housing only a third of the population, and the upper town containing almost half the inhabitants. By the 18th century, Quebec also saw a rise in the number of rental dwellings, to help accommodate a mobile population of seamen, sailors, and merchants, aptly described by historian Yvon Desloges as \\"a town of tenants.\\" Thus, Quebec followed a pattern common throughout New France, of immigrants arriving for several years, before returning home to France. As a whole, approximately 27,000 immigrants came to New France during the French regime, only 31.6% of whom remained. Despite this, by the time of British occupation in 1759, New France had evolved to a colony of over 60,000 with Quebec as the principal city. =Military and warfare= batteries of Quebec fire on English ships in the 1690 Battle of Quebec.

In 1662, to save the colony from frequent Iroquois attacks during the Beaver Wars, Louis XIV dispatched one hundred regulars to the colony. Three years later, in 1665, Lieuitenant-General de Tracy arrived at Quebec City with four companies of regular troops. Before long, troop strength had risen to 1,300.W.J Eccles: Essays on New France, page 111 In 1690, Admiral Phipps' Anglo-American invasion force failed to capture Quebec City during King William's War. Under heavy French artillery fire, the English fleet was considerably damaged and an open battle never took place. After having used most of their ammunition, the English became discouraged and retreated.History of the USA, access online at http://www.usahistory.info/colonial-wars/King-Williams-War.html In 1691, Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac constructed the Royal Battery. In 1711, during Queen Anne's War, Admiral Walker's fleet also failed in its attempt to besiege Quebec City, in this case due to a navigational accident. Walker's initial report stated that 884 soldiers perished. This number was later revised to 740.Chronicles of America, access online at http://www.chroniclesofamerica.com/new-france/queen_annes_war.htm During the Seven Years' War, in 1759, the British, under the command of General James Wolfe, besieged Quebec City for three months. The city was defended by French general the Marquis de Montcalm. The very short battle of the Plains of Abraham lasted approximately 15 minutes and culminated in a British victory and the surrender of Quebec. =Seat of government= Quebec City served as the hub of religious and government authority throughout the French period. From 1608 until 1663, Quebec City was the main administrative center of the Company of New France (see Company of One Hundred Associates). During this period, Quebec City was the home of the company's official representative, the Governor, along with his lieutenant and other administrative officials, and small number of soldiers.Dube, Jean Claude, and Elizabeth Rapley. The Chevalier De Montmagny (1601–1657): First Governor of New France. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 2005. 127. Le Marquis de Beauharnois was the 14th Governor General of New France. New France's administration was centred in Quebec City. Following the Royal Takeover of 1663 by King Louis XIV and his minister Jean Baptiste Colbert, Quebec City became the seat of a reformed colonial government which included the Governor General of New France, responsible for military and diplomatic matters, and an intendant responsible for administrative functions involving law and finance. Both the governor and the intendant were directly answerable to the Minister of the Navy (Ministres Francais de la Marine et des Colonies) and were appointed by the king of France.\\"Quebec, a New French Colony (1608-1755).\\" Ville De Quebec. http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/EN/apropos/portrait/histoire/1608-1755.aspx. The first Governor to arrive in Quebec City directly appointed by the King was Augustin de Saffray de Mésy in 1663. Moreover, Quebec City became the seat of Sovereign Council which served legislative and legal functions in the colony through its role in the ratification of royal edicts and as final court of appeal. The Council contained the twin heads of the colonial government: the governor and the intendant (also the chair), along with the bishop of Quebec. Moreover, the council contained a number of colonial elites, usually merchants from Quebec City. Noteworthy is the fact that, under the French regime, Quebec did not have a municipal government; the centralizing Bourbon monarchy was determined to prevent the emergence of autonomous centers of power in the colony, even local city councils. Furthermore, Quebec City was also the focal point of religious authority in New France and had been since the arrival of the first Recollets missionaries in the city in 1615. Working closely with the State, the Church ensured that the colony remained a well regulated Catholic colony. Quebec City became seat of the bishop in the colony upon the creation of the diocese of Quebec in 1674, with François de Laval as the first bishop. Moreover, Quebec City was home to the Seminaire de Quebec, founded by Laval in 1663 when he was Vicar apostolic before becoming bishop. Laval's experience in the role of Vicar Apostolic highlights the complex nature of relationship between Church and State in New France; while allied with the authority of Rome and the Jesuits on account of his position as Vicar Apostolic, Laval also required the approval from a royal government suspicious of Papal power.Monteyne, J. \\"Absolute Faith, or France Bringing Representation to the Subjects of New France.\\" Oxford Art Journal 20, no. 1 (1997): 12-22. . Although the State and Church based in Quebec City worked closely together, the dominance of the Crown was retained through the responsibility of the Crown of nominating of the bishop and of supplying a large portion of Church funds.Eccles, W. J. Essays on New France. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1987. 33. =Economics= As Quebec was settled for its location on the St. Lawrence River with a deep-water harbor, shipping and import/exports dominated the economy. As a port city, Quebec ran a flourishing trade with the French West Indies and with ports in France. However, trade was restricted to French vessels only trading in officially French ports. In trade with France, Quebec received wine, textiles and cloth, metal products such as guns and knives, salt, and other small consumer and luxury goods not manufactured in the colony. From the French West Indies, Quebec received sugar, molasses, and coffee. In order to offset its debts, Quebec City exported furs to France, as well as lumber and fish to the West Indies. From 1612 to 1638, 15–20,000 beaver pelts were shipped to France, valued at 75,000 livres. The peace experienced in the early 1720s caused a spike in shipping, with 20 to 80 ships arriving annually at the port of Quebec, with an average of 40 a year. However, Quebec was constantly faced with a trade imbalance, debt, and a certain amount of financial insecurity. As with other colonial societies, there was little hard money throughout the colony. To merchants in Quebec, such a situation proved a particular challenge, as they lacked hard specie, or currency, with which to trade. At one point, the colony began the use of playing cards as money in order to reimburse soldiers and other government employees for services rendered when shipments of hard currency failed to arrive. Contentions that the residents of Quebec were poor merchants have, in recent years, been refuted, as historians describe a sharp business acumen, severely circumscribed by a lack of finances and excessive distance from external markets. Jesuit College in 1761. The College was forced to close in 1759 with the beginning of British-rule. =Religion= The Catholic faith played a significant role in the settling and development of Quebec City. With the first missionaries arriving in 1615, Quebec was, almost from its founding, a Catholic city. Although those of other faiths were permitted to practice their faith in private, the city embraced Catholicism as an integral part of daily life.« Reglements généraux du conseil souverain pour la police…, 11 mai 1676, » Pierre Georges Roy, ed., Inventaire des jugements et délibérations du conseil supérieur de la Nouvelle-France de 1717 à 1760, 7 vols. (Beauceville: L'\\"Eclaireur,\\" 1932), 1: 190-205. The Recollets were the first religious order to arrive in 1615, followed by the Jesuits in 1625, who would found a college in Quebec City by 1635. Female religious orders arrived by 1639, with the Ursulines providing education, and the Augustinians servicing the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec. The granting of seigneuries to religious orders helped solidify their place as a facet of society. Indeed, much of the upper town of Quebec came to be held by religious orders. The arrival of Francois de Laval as the vicar apostolic to Quebec in 1658 cemented the place of religion in Quebec City. The city would become a formal parish in 1664, and a diocese by 1674. The Catholic faith not only played a large role in the government and legislation, but also in the social lives of residents. As Quebec City was the seat of religion throughout New France, inhabitants followed the strict schedule of fasting, holy days, and celebrating sacraments, in addition to the censorship of books, dancing, and theatre. After the English invasion of Quebec, the residents were permitted to continue practicing Catholicism under the Act of Quebec in 1774. British rule British regulars and Canadian militia engage the Continental Army in the streets of the city. The Americans' failure to take Quebec in 1775 led to the end of their campaign in Canada. The British and French had co-existed in North America, but the threat of French expansion into the Ohio Valley caused the British to attempt to eradicate New France from the map completely. In the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), the city was permanently lost by the French. In 1763, France formally ceded its claims to le Canada, and Quebec City's French-speaking Catholic population came under the rule of Protestant Britain. The Quebec Act, passed in 1774, allowed 'les Canadiens' (today, also referred to as the Québécois) to have religious and linguistic freedoms, to openly practice their Catholicism and use their French. The Canadiens were therefore not unhappy enough with British rule to choose to participate in the American Revolution. Without Canadian cooperation against the British, the 13 colonies instead attempted to invade Canada. The city was therefore once again under siege when the Battle of Quebec occurred in 1775. The initial attack was a failure due to American inexperience with the extreme cold temperatures of the city in December. Benedict Arnold refused to accept the defeat in the Battle of Quebec and a siege against the city continued until May 6, 1776, when the American army finally retreated. The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided Canada into an \\"Upper\\", English-speaking colony, and a \\"Lower\\", French-speaking colony. Quebec City was made the capital of Lower Canada and enjoyed more self-rule following the passage of this act. The city's industry began to grow, and by the early 19th century it was the third largest port city in North America. Lumber was the largest export of the city at this time. The business boom continued for most of the century and Quebec City began welcoming thousands of immigrants. Mackenzie King, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Earl of Athlone (left-to-right) at the First Quebec Conference, a secret military conference held in World War II. 20th century In 1917, the construction of the Quebec Bridge, connecting the north and south banks of the St. Lawrence River, was finished. To this day, it is the longest cantilever bridge in the world, though two collapses of the centre of the bridge during construction cost over 80 workers their lives. During World War II, two Allied Forces conferences were held in the city. The first, held in 1943, assembled Franklin Delano Roosevelt, president of the United States of America; Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada and T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs. The second conference was held in 1944 and Churchill and Roosevelt participated. The conferences were held at the Citadel and nearby Château Frontenac. Modern Quebec City In 1984, Opération Nez rouge was founded in Quebec City. It has been imitated in many European countries. In April 2001, Quebec City played host to the Summit of the Americas where the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was discussed. This conference was expected to be filled with confrontations between the police and anti-globalization groups, which meant that the location of walled Quebec City was vital for security reasons. On January 1, 2002, surrounding towns were incorporated into the existing city. The \\"New Quebec city\\" includes 11 former municipalities: Sainte-Foy, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sillery, Loretteville, Val-Bélair, Cap- Rouge, Saint-Émile, Vanier, and Lac-Saint-Charles, in addition to the original Quebec City. In 2005, Capitale-Nationale played host to a major world sporting event, the World Police and Fire Games, which was a success for the city, with as many as 11,000 athletes and 14,000 persons accompanying them, making 25,000 persons in total. The city also experienced higher than average temperatures with an average of 30 degrees Celsius.

In Saxony, the network peaked shortly after World War I with over of tracks. At first, it was primarily created to connect the small towns and villages in Saxony – which had formed a viable industry in the 19th century – to already established standard-gauge railways. But even shortly after 1900, some of the railways would become important for tourism in the area.  History  = Beginnings = The Dohna station of the Müglitz Valley Railway Around 1875, the Royal Saxon State railway network, unlike other states in Germany, had already expanded to cover most of the territory of Saxony. Due to the mountainous terrain, any further expansion was met with a disproportional cost increase. In order to keep costs down, most new track projects were then planned and executed as branch lines, with smaller radii for curves, simpler operating rules and unsupervised stations and yards as the primary means to save costs. However, to connect the small towns and villages in the deep and narrow Ore Mountain valleys with their diverse industry, standard-gauge tracks were only feasible with an enormous amount of technical and financial investment. Therefore, the directorate of the Royal Saxon State Railways, given the example of the existing Bröl Valley Railway and Upper Silesian Railway, decided in favor of narrow-gauge railways. The first narrow-gauge railway in Saxony opened in 1881 between Wilkau-Haßlau and Kirchberg. In addition, the Weißeritztalbahn and the Mügeln railway network were already under construction. Many additional narrow-gauge railways, such as the Thumer Netz, were built in short order, almost all of them using a standardized track gauge. In the meantime, standard-gauge projects in Saxony were scaled back to tracks that connected already existing standard-gauge railways, or where the transfer of goods between the standard and narrow tracks was not feasible or profitable. = Expansion before World War I = Switch tower in Zittau Within 20 years, the Saxon narrow-gauge railway network had almost reached its final size. After 1900, only few additional railways were added. Most were just additions to existing lines that brought operational advantages. Although the narrow-gauge network made very little profit, it was very important for the industrial development of Saxony. Without the narrow-gauge tracks – that permitted industrial sidings to small companies in narrow and steep valleys – an industrial development in the poor Ore Mountain area of Saxony would have hardly been possible. However, it was soon evident that the narrow-gauge railways were not always up to task for all cargo demands. Mainly, the transloading of freight between the breaks of gauge was time-consuming and expensive. To avoid additional cargo handling on the Dresden- Klotzsche–Königsbrück line, a container system was tested (\\"Umsetzkästen\\") in which the whole cargo box of a freight car was transferred between standard and narrow-gauge frames. Since this railway was converted to standard gauge shortly after, the tests were abandoned. Instead, roll-block traffic was now favored. However, it was soon evident that piggy-backing standard-gauge freight cars onto the narrow-gauge tracks did not meet the initial goals of operating the narrow-gauge railways on a very small budget: The railways needed large investments to reinforce the tracks, increase the structure gauge to accommodate a larger loading gauge and to acquire stronger steam locomotives. = Between world wars = Rail network expansion came to a halt on the outbreak of World War I; only projects on which work had already begun, such as the extension of Müglitz Valley Railway and the Klingenberg- Colmnitz–Oberdittmannsdorf Railway, were completed. The Pöbel Valley Railway was stopped, and later abandoned altogether. In the 1920s, most Saxon narrow- gauge railways experienced a first crisis. Even though cargo and passenger traffic was up, the cost exceeded the operational income. Reason was foremost the 1920s German inflation as well as higher cost for the personnel. In addition, the Reichspost had started a bus service, which for marginally higher cost was faster and hence was drawing passengers away from the railway. The Deutsche Reichsbahn tried to counter that trend with more modern passenger cars, higher-powered locomotives and more trains. Some railways were planned to be converted to standard gauge, but only the Müglitz Valley Railway was converted in 1938. In the 1930s, a few of the railways were scheduled to end their service, but this did not happen until much later. Starting in 1928, there were a large number of technical and equipment upgrades. The rail network acquired higher capacity, four-axle bogie passenger cars with steam heating and electrical lighting, which brought passenger comfort up to par with standard gauge. Vacuum brakes and Scharfenberg couplers were introduced across the board, and superheated locomotives like the Saxon VI K were brought into service. Flood damage in Glashütte A severe flood in July 1927 affected many of the railways in Saxony, especially the Müglitz Valley Railway tracks, which were destroyed to a large degree. They were rebuilt soon afterwards. In the 1930s, more improvements were made to the railways. Modern signal towers were built for the Zittau–Oybin–Jonsdorf railway and the Weißeritztalbahn. The Kipsdorf and Oberwiesenthal stations were rebuilt and extended; the Weißeritztalbahn and the Fichtelberg Railway could now accommodate over-length trains with up to 56 axles. Technical development stagnated during World War II. More and more personnel was drafted into the Wehrmacht, and the railways were maintained less and less. At the same time, the cargo volume rose in support of the war effort. The railways were not directly affected by military action, but with the fronts drawing near in April and May 1945, the railways ceased operations. = After World War II = Steam locomotive 99 561 of the Pressnitz Valley Railway in Niederschmiedeberg After the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945, operations of the Saxon narrow-gauge railways started back up in relative short time. Problems were primarily caused by the relatively desolate condition of the rolling stock, which was compounded by the largely destroyed Ausbesserungswerk in Chemnitz no longer being in a position to repair narrow-gauge locomotives. As an example, this caused service of the Schwarzbach Railway to be interrupted whenever the only operational locomotive was in need of repair. This situation grew worse as part of the more modern and powerful rolling stock had to be surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Two railways in Upper Lusatia, the Herrnhut–Bernstadt Railway and the Taubenheim–Dürrhennersdorf Railway, were completely dismantled in 1945 and – as war reparations – shipped east. In addition, traffic increased enormously for some railways in the Ore Mountains when the SDAG Wismut started mining uranium and thousands of miners required transportation on shift change. Overall, the transport volume was still well below the levels of the 1930s, because of the lack of locomotives. In May 1947, 467 out of a total of 521 passenger cars were parked and not needed. This only changed after the new Neubaulokomotive DR Class 99.77-79 was put into service in 1953, and the transport volume reached the 1930s levels again. It would not last long, as history repeated itself when newly created bus services again drew passengers from the railway. Trucks did the same for the cargo volume. = Service termination in the 1960s = With the beginning of the 1960s, the situation for the narrow-gauge railways grew worse. Due to lack of maintenance since World War II, most tracks were in a dire state of repair, as only small sections of the tracks had been rebuilt on the more important railways. In addition, a part of the rolling stock, especially the Saxon IV K locomotives, were then at the end of their service life. Due to a lack of alternatives, the Ausbesserungswerk in Görlitz started the reconstruction (literally) of the Saxon IV K and Saxon VI K locomotives. However, a fundamental decision of the faith of the narrow-gauge railways had to be made. In 1963 and 1964, the government of East Germany conducted an efficiency study. This study found that only if a complete overhaul of the tracks and rolling stock were to take place would it make sense to keep the narrow-gauge railways operational. It concluded that due to a lack of resources to rebuild the tracks and lack of capacity to construct and build new diesel locomotives, the closing of the narrow-gauge railways was not just a technical, but primarily an economic requirement. On May 14, 1964, the Ministerrat decided that all narrow-gauge railways of East Germany were to cease operations by 1975. This shutdown program first started relatively slowly, since neither buses nor trucks were available in the required quantities. The first railways were shut down in 1966 and 1967, with some of the last train runs having country fair character. By 1970, protests started against the shutdown of the Bimmelbahn railways, with the result that no or only very short official notice was given when a rail section was shut down and there were no more celebrations. Partly due to the protests, in 1974 a decision was made to keep a total of seven narrow-gauge railways in East Germany as tourist and heritage railways. For Saxony, they were: * Fichtelberg Railway: Cranzahl–Oberwiesenthal * Radebeul–Radeburg railway: Radebeul- East–Moritzburg–Radeburg * Weißeritztalbahn: Freital-Hainsberg–Kipsdorf * Zittauer railway: Zittau–Oybin/Jonsdorf = Development since 1975 = Transporter wagon train of the Mügeln railway network near Oschatz By the beginning of 1975 – the year of the planned shutdown – there were still six narrow-gauge railways in operation in Saxony. The Thum–Meinersdorf section of the Thumer Netz still had cargo service, and a part of the Wilkau- Haßlau–Carlsfeld Railway was still operational. Two small tracks were used as industrial siding for paper mills. The condition of the rolling stock was good, since the shutdown of other railways freed up additional rolling stock. However, the tracks were in disrepair and required many slow zones. The remaining operations at the Thumer Netz ceased at the end of 1975, and passenger service was also terminated between Oschatz and Mügeln. At the four railways that were to be kept, the necessary repairs and renewal of tracks and rolling stock made only slow progress. By 1977 the first modernized passenger car – the so-called REKO car – was put into service. The reconstruction of the remaining cars was progressing slowly, by the end of the 1980s only half of the existing passenger cars were updated. A complete change in direction came in 1981, when the Soviet Union cut their oil exports to East Germany. With oil (and hence diesel) in high demand, the direction was changed to move all freight and passenger transports back to rail service. In addition, any planned railway service terminations of the DR were scrutinized, and – as a first reaction – it was decided to keep the railway between Oschatz and Mügeln of the Mügeln railway network. The tracks of this segment were rebuilt by 1984. However, the Pressnitz Valley Railway was still to be dismantled, and in 1986 operations ceased. Until 1989, about one-half of the still existing tracks had been rebuilt. By 1987, the last of the rolling stock with Heberlein brakes was retired – after more than 100 years in service – since the shutdown of the Pressnitz Valley Railway freed enough rolling stock with vacuum brakes. By 1989, almost all Saxon rolling stock was converted to air brakes. By the end of the 1980s, the first Einheitslokomotiven and Neubaulokomotiven were retired due to frame and boiler damage. As a replacement of the aging fleet of steam locomotives, the DR in 1989 announced plans to import diesel locomotives from Romania by 1995. = New beginnings after 1990 = The German reunification in 1990 placed the narrow-gauge railways in Saxony, which were at that point still operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, into a new situation. A working group was tasked to find answers on how to operate the railways under the new conditions. a train of the Zittau–Oybin/Jonsdorf railway heritage railway in 2008 Without government regulations holding them back, a group of enthusiasts formed in 1990, with the goal of rebuilding the upper part of the Pressnitz Valley Railway as fast as possible. Smiled upon at first, the group indeed managed to get segments of the railway operational, and within a few years, a recognized heritage railway had been created. By 1992, the direction was to either privatize or abandon the narrow-gauge railways. A first victim was the Oschatz–Kemmlitz railway. Only the intervention of citizen groups and local government saved the railway, which was privatized as Döllnitzbahn. For all other narrow-gauge railways, freight service was terminated. In the mid-1990s, the government of Saxony started to discuss concepts for the conservation of the narrow-gauge railways in the state. At first, the idea was to have an organization owned by the state of Saxony operating the railways; this concept was shelved. Instead, a privatization led by municipalities and their districts was the preferred solution. This was first put into practice in the district of Zittau, which at the end of 1996 together with track-side municipalities took over operations of the Zittau–Oybin–Jonsdorf railway. For the 100 year anniversary of the Fichtelberg Railway in 1997, a fest week was organized, which was unlike any other event involving narrow-gauge railways in Germany. With the success of that celebration, local politicians and Deutsche Bahn manager started to think in a new direction, and the local district and communities took over operations of this railway as well.

It is based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor but shares many features with the contemporary Sun-3 series systems.  Hardware  Unlike the Sun-3 models, the Sun386i has a PC-like motherboard and \\"mini- tower\\"-style chassis. Two variants were produced, the Sun386i/150 and the Sun386i/250 with a 20 or 25 MHz CPU respectively. The motherboard includes the CPU, 80387 FPU, 82380 timer/DMA/interrupt controller and a custom Ethernet IC called BABE (\\"Bus Adapter Between Ethernet\\"). Floppy disk, SCSI, RS-232 and Centronics parallel interfaces are also provided, as are four ISA slots (one 8-bit, three 16-bit) and four proprietary 32-bit \\"local\\" bus slots. The latter are used for RAM and frame buffer cards. Two type of RAM card are available, a 4 or 8 MB card, and the \\"XP Cache\\" card, incorporating up to 8 MB with an 82385 cache controller and 32 KB of cache SRAM. Up to two memory cards can be installed, to give a maximum RAM capacity of 16 MB. Mass storage options are either 91 or 327 MB internal SCSI hard disks and a 1.4 MB 3.5 in floppy drive. A storage expansion box that holds two more disks can be mounted to the top of the chassis. Frame buffer options include the 1024×768 or 1152×900-pixel monochrome BW2 card, the 8-bit color CG3 with similar resolutions, or the accelerated 8-bit color CG5, otherwise known as the Roadracer or GXi framebuffer. This uses the TI TMS34010 graphics processor and had a resolution of 1152x900. In addition, a \\"SunVGA\\" accelerator card can be installed in the ISA expansion slot that allows a DOS session to display a full VGA window on the desktop. The 386i introduced the Sun Type 4 keyboard, a hybrid of the earlier Type 3 and PC/AT layouts. This was later used for the SPARCstation line of workstations.  Software  The Sun386i's firmware is similar to the Sun-3's \\"PROM Monitor\\". A 386 port of SunOS is the native operating system of the 386i. SunOS releases 4.0, 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 support the architecture. A beta version of SunOS 4.0.3 for the 386i also exists but was not generally available, except possibly to the U.S. government. Included with SunOS are the SunView GUI and VP/ix MS-DOS emulator. This runs as a SunOS process and thus allows multiple MS-DOS session to be run simultaneously, a major selling point of the Sun386i. Unix long file names are accessed using a mapping to DOS 8.3 filenames, Sun 386i manual for DOS command the file names being modified to include a tilde and to be unique as far as possible. This system is similar to, but predates, that used for long file names in Microsoft's VFAT. Special drive letters are used including H: for the user's home directory and D: for the current working directory when the DOS shell is started. The C: drive corresponds to a file in the Unix file system which appears to DOS as a 20 MB hard disk. This is used especially for the installation of copy-protected software; files in this virtual drive are inaccessible to Unix programs. The Sun386i version of SunOS includes many features not found in the versions then shipped with Sun-3 workstations (and later with then-new SPARC workstations), in addition to VP/ix. These additions focus on ease of use for end users who are likely not to be UNIX experts, and includes enhanced desktop tools (which, for the first time at Sun, used color by default) and an \\"out of box experience\\" that was painless and administrator-free, targeted to bring a system onto the network (\\"box to mail\\") in fifteen minutes. It uses the pioneering Dynamic RARPRFC 1931 Dynamic RARP Extensions for Automatic Network Address Acquisition network protocol. At the time, and for a few years afterwards until DHCP later became standard, no other vendors' workstations (or PCs) were as easy to install on TCP/IP networks.  Sun486i  An upgraded model, the Sun486i (codename Apache) was designed, incorporating a 25 MHz 80486 CPU and improved SCSI interface. A small pre-production batch was built but the product was canceled in 1990, before its official launch.

Built between 1992 and 2004, it was developed by the Del Webb Corporation as an \\"active\\" community for people 55 years of age and older called Sun City Palm Springs. Despite its name, it was located from Palm Springs, and its postal address was in the Unincorporated community of Bermuda Dunes. As it neared completion, its residents joined with the nearby city of Palm Desert to have their mail handled through that post office and renamed the community Sun City Palm Desert. The community remains in an unincorporated area, however, and has no voice in the city politics of Palm Desert itself. Sun City Palm Desert is no longer managed by Del Webb and today is governed by its own community association. In 2008, according to Riverside County officials the community was renamed Desert Palms by the county government. The Del Webb Company trademark name was dropped when it went out of business and the country club operations went to Indio, California-based Pulte Homes Inc., who also developed Sun City Shadow Hills.http://www.scshca.com/ However, the retirement community remains called Sun City Palm Desert for commercial purposes.

The film was made by Hammer Film Productions but performed unsuccessfully at the box office. Plot The film opens in Victorian London on a December night in 1900. The first night of the season at the London Opera House finds the opening of a new opera by Lord Ambrose D'Arcy (Michael Gough), a wealthy and pompous man who is annoyed and scornful when the opera manager Lattimer (Thorley Walters) informs him the theatre has not been completely sold out. No one will sit in a certain box because it is haunted. Backstage, despite the soothing efforts of the opera's producer, Harry Hunter (Edward de Souza), everyone, including the show's star, Maria, is nervous and upset as if a sinister force was at work. When the body of a murdered stagehand swings out of the wings during Maria's first aria, pandemonium ensues. With the show postponed and Maria refusing to perform again, Harry frantically auditions new singers. He finds a promising young star in Christine Charles (Heather Sears), one of the chorus girls. Lord Ambrose lecherously approves of the selection and invites Christine to dinner. In her dressing room, Christine is warned against Lord Ambrose by a Phantom voice. That night, Lord Ambrose attempts to seduce her, but as they are about to leave for his apartment, Harry saves her. On the ride back home, Christine tells Harry about the voice she heard. Intrigued, Harry takes Christine back to the opera house, wherein her dressing room, the same voice tells Harry to leave her there and go. At the same time, the rat-catcher (Patrick Troughton) is murdered by the Phantom's lackey, a dwarf (Ian Wilson). Investigating the murder, Harry leaves Christine by herself, where she is approached by a man dressed in black, wearing a mask with only one eye, The Phantom of the Opera. He tells her she must come with him, but she screams, and The Phantom flees. Harry comforts her and takes her home. The next day Lord Ambrose sends a dismissal to Christine for refusing to come back to his apartment. Lord Ambrose chooses a more willing but less talented singer to take Christine's place. When Harry refuses to accept this, he is also dismissed by Lord Ambrose. Visiting Christine at her boarding house, Harry finds some old manuscripts that he recognizes as a rough draft of the opera he has produced. Questioning Christine's landlady Mrs. Tucker, he learns that it was written by a former boarder named Professor Petrie, who had been killed in a fire at a printing press that was to print his music. Making further inquiries, he learns that Petrie did not actually perish in the fire, but was splashed with Nitric Acid while apparently trying to extinguish the blaze, had run away in agony and was drowned in the River Thames. This is confirmed by the policeman who was in the area at the time, but the body was never recovered. Harry and Christine have a romantic day together. While having a moonlight carriage ride, Harry tells her about Petrie, and that he is convinced that Lord Ambrose stole Petrie's music. He leaves it at that, as he believes that the Professor is long since dead. When Christine gets home, she is confronted by the dwarf and faints from fright and is carried off. When she wakes, she is in the Phantom's lair deep in the cellars of the opera house, and the Phantom (Herbert Lom) is playing a huge organ. He tells the frightened girl that he will teach her to sing properly and rehearses her with fanatical insistence until she collapses from exhaustion. Meanwhile, Harry, reinstated as the opera producer, is worried about Christine's disappearance. Pondering the story of the mysterious Professor, he checks the river where he had last been seen. At that same moment, he hears the echo of Christine's voice emanating from a storm drain and soon finds himself following the voice through one of London's water-filled sewers. The faint sound of the organ playing draws him down a tunnel where the dwarf attacks him with a knife. Harry subdues him and finds himself facing the missing Professor as Christine looks on from a bed (where she'd been sleeping). Harry asks the professor what had happened in his past. In a flashback, the Phantom says that five years before, as a poor and starving composer, he had been forced to sell all of his music, including the opera, to Lord Ambrose for a pitifully small fee with the thought that his being published would bring him recognition. When he discovered that Lord Ambrose was having the music published under his own name, Petrie became enraged and broke into the printers to destroy the plates. While burning the music that had already been printed, Petrie unwittingly started a fire, then accidentally splashed acid on his face and hands in an effort to put it out, thinking it was water. In terrible agony, he ran out, jumped into the river, and was swept by the current into an underground drain, where he was rescued and cared for by the dwarf. The Phantom says that he is dying, but he wishes to see his opera performed by Christine. They both agree to allow him time to complete her voice coaching. Several weeks later, on the eve of a performance of \\"Saint Joan,\\" the Phantom confronts Lord Ambrose in his office. He rips off The Phantom's mask and runs out screaming into the night after seeing his terrifying face. The Phantom then watches Christine sing from the \\"haunted\\" box. Her performance brings him to tears as he hears his music finally presented. Listening enraptured to the music, the dwarf is discovered in the catwalks by a stage-hand, and in the chase, he jumps onto a huge chandelier poised high above the stage over Christine. As the rope begins to break from the weight, the Phantom spots the danger. He rips off his mask, leaps from his box to the stage, and pushes Christine safely from harm. The chandelier impales him before the eyes of the horror-stricken audience.

Production Based upon the interest generated by the Phantom of the Opera sequence in the Lon Chaney biopic Man of a Thousand Faces, and the success of the 1943 remake, Universal was interested in revisiting the story again. The first plans for remake were in-studio, with William Alland producing and Franklin Coen writing.\\"'Phantom of the Opera' to be Remade by U-I.\\" BoxOffice Magazine. 2 February 1957. Page 33. Plans for this remake fell through, but upon the success of the distribution of Dracula for Hammer, Universal decided to let the British outfit tackle the project instead and announced the project in February, 1959.\\"Foreign Films Gaining Favor in US.\\" BoxOffice Magazine. Page 50. Two months later, Hammer Pictures struck a five- year deal with Columbia Pictures to produce five films a year. On these terms, Hammer's previous arrangements (such as The Mummy for Universal Studios and The Hound of the Baskervilles for United Artists) could be fulfilled, but thereafter could produce only two pictures a year for other studios. Phantom of the Opera was among those announced for Universal.\\"Hammer, Columbia Pact: 25 Films in Five Years\\". BoxOffice Magazine. 23 March 1959. Page 15. Over the next two years, the project fell on and off the charts. In 1960, the project was connected with Kathryn Grayson, although she had not been in pictures for some years.Boxoffice Barometer. 29 February 1960. Page 159. According to author Wayne Kinsey's interpretation of a quote from producer Anthony Hinds, the romantic lead (Harry Hunter) was written for Cary Grant .Wayne A. Kinsey Hammer Films: The Bray Studio Years, Reynolds & Hearn, 2002 Grant had expressed his interest in doing a Hammer horror film, at a time when it was common for American actors to be featured in British films. Actually, what Hinds said repeatedly in interviews was, \\"I wrote the script for Cary Grant,\\" which makes it far more likely Grant was to play the title role, not a subordinate leading man. Production for the film started in November 1961. As with most of the Hammer productions, the film was shot at Bray Studios on a modest budget. Lom recalled in one interview how the producers at Hammer expected actors to throw themselves into their work: \\"For one of my scenes, the Hammer people wanted me to smash my head against a stone pillar, because they said they couldn't afford one made of rubber,\\" Lom reveals. \\"I refused to beat my head against stone, of course. This caused a 'big crisis', because it took them half a day to make a rubber pillar that looked like stone. And of course, it cost a few pennies more. Horror indeed!\\" Many of the exterior sets utilised were on the studio's backlot and had already been used for many Hammer productions previously.

All of the flashback scenes showing how Professor Petrie became the Phantom were filmed with \\"Dutch angles,\\" meaning the camera was noticeably tilted to give an unreal, off-kilter effect: a time-honored method in film of representing either a flashback or a dream. The Phantom of the Opera opened in New York City on 22 August 1962 at the RKO Palace Theater. In person was Sonya Cordeau, who played \\"Yvonne\\" in the picture. Cordeau later went on tour with the film for Universal.\\"Broadway Report.\\" BoxOffice Magazine. 20 August 1962. Page E-5. When the film had its American TV premiere on NBC, additional footage of Scotland Yard police inspectors (played by Liam Redmond and John Maddison) looking for the Phantom was filmed to increase the running time. This footage was shot at Universal Studios, and Hammer Productions had no input at all. The Kiss of the Vampire and The Evil of Frankenstein also had American-shot footage added to their television showings as well. This was a common practice when it was thought that parts of the film were \\"too intense.\\" These scenes were edited out, and more acceptable scenes replaced them or extended the running time. In common with Hammer's usual practice, when shown in British cinemas in 1962, the film was paired with Captain Clegg, another of the studio's films. Music The music in this movie features Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, arguably the most famous piece of organ music ever composed, and one that has become commonly associated with horror films.  Critical reception  The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \\"The absurd, much-filmed story crumbles—at any rate here—once the ingénue is reconciled to The Phantom as her mentor; but its Gothic elements are rich enough to defy time ... Surprisingly tasteful for a Hammer film, the production is also quite imaginative (The Phantom's rocky, water-lapped lair, complete with organ and double-bed) and careful.\\" Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film \\"a real disappointment ... In the hands of the British, with Herbert Lom as the opera ogre, the result is ornate and pretty dull. Whatever happened, chaps?\\" Variety wrote that the film \\"still provides a fair measure of goose pimples to combat some potential unwanted yocks. In the shadow of its predecessors the current 'Phantom' seems a reasonable booking for average houses, without doing anything to erase oldtimers' memories of the earlier versions.\\" Harrison's Reports gave the film a grade of \\"Fair\\", writing, \\"The story of creative fakery, revenge and danger is not only loosely woven together, but its believability is weak. Its dénouement is thin and vaporish.\\" The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films wrote of the film: \\"Although distinguished by some fine acting, sets and music, The Phantom of the Opera seems decidedly half-baked.\\" The author(s) called Terence Fisher's direction \\"misguided\\", and noted that distributor J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors' \\"emasculation of the British print sealed its fate.\\" The film also takes away much of the Phantom's dark, morbid side, making him a tragic hero. Home video release In North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films on the 4-DVD set The Hammer Horror Series (ASIN: B0009X770O), which is part of MCA-Universal's Franchise Collection.

It was formed in 1999 by the merger of Karstadt Warenhaus AG, founded in 1920, with Quelle AG, founded in 1927. In 2005, the corporation had about 68,000 employees and annual sales of €15.5 billion. Its stocks were traded on the Mid Cap DAX until September 2009. The company's largest store was Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe) in Berlin, and the largest store operated by Karstadt was in Frankfurt. Arcandor requested financial assistance from the German government, which was rejected by the European Commission on 3 June 2009. On 6 June 2009, the company announced it was no longer able to pay rent for its department stores, which the company had previously sold and leasebacked. Three days later, the company filed for bankruptcy. History The first Karstadt department store opened in 1881 in Wismar. On 14 May 1881, Rudolph Karstadt founded his first store Tuch-, Manufaktur- und Konfektionsgeschäft Karstadt (Karstadt fabric, factory outlet and ready-to wear store) in Wismar. In 1884, a second store was opened in Lübeck. Soon, 24 stores had been opened in all of Northern Germany. In 1920, the business was turned into a joint stock company. In 1984, Karstadt acquired the mail-order business Neckermann Versand. In 1994, it acquired the department store chain Hertie, to which KaDeWe belonged. In 1999 it merged with Quelle AG to become KarstadtQuelle AG. On 1 July 2007 the company was renamed Arcandor AG. On 5 June 2009, investigations started into possible breach of trust offenses by Arcandor's former CEO Thomas Middelhoff. In June 2009, Arcandor filed for bankruptcy protection after its request for loan guarantees of up to €650 million was rejected by the German government. The German government subsequently agreed on 30 June to provide a €71 million loan to Quelle. The company's holding in the Thomas Cook Group was sold by Arcandor's creditor banks in September 2009. The administrators of Arcandor chose in October 2009 to liquidate the Quelle mail order business, following unsuccessful attempts to find a buyer. In September 2010 the American investor Nicolas Berggruen bought the Karstadt business to save it from insolvency. Business segments Arcandor was active in the following business segments: * Brick-and-mortar operations: **Department stores: Karstadt, KaDeWe, Wertheim, Alsterhaus, Oberpollinger, WoM (World of Music), Schaulandt, LeBuffet, Fox Markt **Specialty stores: KarstadtSport (athletic equipment, etc.) * Mail-order: **General: neckermann.de (until 2005 known as Neckermann Versand), Quelle **Specialty assortments: Walz, Hess Natur, Fritz Berger, Madeleine, BON'A PARTE, clinic+job-dress, DK Berufsmoden, Simon Jersey * Services: **Tourism: Bucher Reisen, Thomas Cook Group (52% ownership) **Financial services: KarstadtQuelle Bank, KarstadtQuelle Finanz Service **Other services: Customer loyalty scheme (HappyDigits), Itellium, KarstadtQuelle Information Services Arcandor's websites, when taken together, put Arcandor easily in the top 20, and maybe in the top 10, in the rankings of all web properties ranked by numbers of unique visitors per month, among internet users in Germany.In July 2008 Arcandor AG's combined websites ranked number 9 on the list of all websites ranked by unique visitors per month, among German internet users, according to data compiled by Comscore. See Most of this traffic was shoppers at online stores branded with the company's brick-and-mortar store brands or its mail-order catalog brands. Quelle Company right Quelle Ag, which merged with Karstadt, was founded on the 26th of October 1927 by Gustav Schickedanz. =Nazi Period= In 1932 Schickedanz joined the NSDAP and therefore was able to acquire several major companies in the region by Aryanization from their former jewish owners. 1939 Quelle had around two million regular customers and made 40 million Reichsmark. =Restart= After the second World War the Allies banned Schickedanz from exercising his profession, his properties were confiscated and he was sentenced to imprisonment with labour. In 1948 he was released, during him serving his sentence, his sister, Liesl Kießling, managed Quelle. His wife opened the first Quelle store after the war, in 1946. Since 1948 the delivery business of Quelle was being rebuilt. As the Denazification Process on Gustav Schickedanz began, it was noted that of Gustav Schickedandanz’s past capital of 9 Million Deutsche Mark about 7 Million were of former jewesh ownership.

Lévy coined the phrase les arts incohérents as a play on the term les arts décoratifs (i.e. arts & crafts, but above all, a famous art school in Paris, the National School of Decorative Arts). The Incoherents presented work which was deliberately irrational and iconoclastic, used found objects, was nonsensical, included humoristic sketches, drawings by children, and drawings \\"made by people who don't know how to draw\\". Lévy exhibited an all-black painting by poet Paul Bilhaud called Combat de Nègres dans un Tunnel (Negroes Fight in a Tunnel). The early film animator Émile Cohl contributed photographs which would later be called surreal. The Mona Lisa Smoking a Pipe by Sapeck, in Le Rire, 1887. Although a small and short-lived movement, the Incoherents were well-known. The group sprang from the same Montmartre cabaret culture that spawned the Hydropathes of Émile Goudeau and Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi. The October 1882 show was attended by two thousand people, including Manet, Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Richard Wagner. Beginning in 1883 there were annual shows, or masked balls, or both. In an 1883 show, the artist Sapeck (Eugène Bataille)(French) contributed Le rire, an \\"augmented\\" Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, that directly prefigures the famous Marcel Duchamp 1919 \\"appropriation\\" of the Mona Lisa, L.H.O.O.Q.. The movement wound down in the mid-1890s. History The Incoherents were born in the late nineteenth century, a period that was rich in scientific discoveries and social innovations. Cheeky and inventive, this time also marks a turning point in the field of art. The official art traditions were even being questioned in the newspapers through satirical images which implied it was a dying craft. It was in this creative lull that Jules Levy - former member of the literary club Hydropathes - decided to organize \\"an exhibition of drawings made by people who can not draw.\\" This charitable carnival helped victims of a recent gas explosion to have an opportunity to present their works. The first \\"Incoherent arts\\" get-together, which took place on July 13, 1882 on the Champs Elysées hosts many curiosities. Taking advantage of a power outage, and lit only by candlelight, they created a jumble of rebellious works, using all types of materials and any inspiration with the ultimate goal of making people laugh. On October 2, 1882, Jules Lévy decided to repeat the experience at home. He gathered his friends under the pretense of having an \\"unusual evening\\". In his tiny apartment they worked under the phrase \\"Death to clichés, to us young people!\\" They received unexpected success and much newspaper coverage. As a result, the Incohérents arts movement became ingrained into the Parisian cultural landscape. In October 1883 the Paris had its first official exhibition of Incoherent art, ran by local Galerie Vivienne. The purpose was charitable as with all Incoherent exhibits thereafter. A regulation 13-point proclamation was that \\"All the works are allowed, the serious works and obscene excepted\\". The exhibition adopts a true catalog, including a piece by Levy Orville in which he reverses an inkwell for the sake of aesthetics. The tone of the exhibition was set by an abundance of parodies and pictorial puns. More than 20,000 visitors took part over a month. A year later, the Incoherents returned to haunt the Galerie Vivienne with their cheeky pranks. They hoped this occasion would see the image of the \\"Chief pipes Poyle sand without number, on a silver field,\\" an ancient statue carving chisel of an academician who does not lead wide. A catalog accompanied the exhibition with luxury engraved reproductions of most of the significant works. On its cover, a dancer brandishes a broom and scares away the gloom of black birds. The journalists accompanied the event with enthusiasm. The artists were increasingly familiarizing themselves with the pictorial map and the pun, both of which helped to establish this kind of \\"Incoherent\\" art. In 1886 the Incoherents at the Eden Theatre unveiled their new exhibit. Jules Chéret's poster included Levy going through the moon like a paper hoop. At the entrance, the rules regarding the event were framed prominently: \\"One goal you propose, laugh and cheer you frankly.\\" The room was also full of visitors that worked in high, medium or low relief. Everything was recorded in catalog records which are decorated with \\"striking\\" portraits of exhibitors and zany references. 1886 In 1886 Jules Levy began to be the target of criticism. He was accused of using the Incoherent Arts for its own interests. He had in fact opened a publishing house in 1886 and published the works of his friends (Goudeau, Leroy, Monselet, etc..), illustrated by artists such as Boutet, Somm or Gray. He lost the support of the satirical weekly magazine Le Courrier français who had declared him \\"the official unofficial Incoherent\\" in 1884. Meanwhile, others began taking advantage of the Incoherent movement by opening Incoherent cafés or magazines, that the founders of the movement had nothing to do with. In 1887 Jules Levy promised the end of Inconsistency would be on April 16 of that year. A costume party was organized for the occasion with a Folies Bergère funeral procession. However, Incoherence has a brief renaissance on March 27, 1889 at a new dance held at the Eden Theatre. Levy wanted this event to remind the good memories of the Incoherent arts and to announce the return of his exhibitions. But in the spring of the 1889 exhibition he organized, while the Expo was in full swing in Paris, it was a fiasco. The press hardly covered the event, and even the Le Courrier français remained silent. The Incoherent arts had lost its novelty value. Jules Levy, refusing to give up, created the magazine Folies Bergère in January 1891. Poorly organized, not repeated, the show is considered too long and the ball too short. The last gasp of the inconsistency, his exhibition of 1893 had a brand new premise at Olympia, and passed almost unnoticed. Jules Blois of the French Mail wrote: \\"All that is outdated, outmoded. Inconsistency joined decadence, decay and other jokes with or without handles in the bag of old fashioned chiffes\\" Despite that, Levy still pulled on the Incoherent string until 1896 when it was met with massive indifference from the press. 1899  See also  * Anti-art * Alphonse Allais * Found object References  External links  * Arts Incoherents (in French) archive copy * Parisian cabarets and the avant-garde, 1875-1905 * Eugéne Bataille at French Wikipedia French art movements Art movements French art ","title":"Incoherents"},{"id":"4029804","text":"Logo of Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof since March 25th 2019 Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH is a German department store chain whose headquarters are in Essen.

HBC CEO Helena Foulkes said the two companies were excited to bring together two \\"iconic banners to create Germany's leading retail business.\\" History The first Karstadt department store opened in Wismar in 1881. On 14 May 1881 Rudolph Karstadt opened his first store in Wismar under the name “Tuch-, Manufactur- und Confectionsgeschäft Karstadt”. Karstadt's strategy of offering fixed low prices in place of the still normal haggling was successful from the start as a result of which he had soon opened branches in 24 towns across Northern Germany. The second Karstadt store opened in Lübeck in 1884. The first customers included Thomas Mann and his brother Heinrich. Further branches opened in Neumünster (1888), Braunschweig (1890), Kiel (1893), Mölln (1895), Eutin (1896) and Preetz (1897). In 1900 Rudolph Karstadt took over 13 stores from his highly indebted brother Ernst Karstadt in Anklam, Dömitz, Friedland, Greifswald, Güstrow, Hamburg (Röhrendamm), Ludwigslust, Neubrandenburg, Schwerin, Stavenhagen, Wandsbek (Lübecker Straße) and Waren (Müritz). Further branches opened in Bremen (1902), Hamburg-Eimsbüttel (1903), Altona (1903), Hanover (1906) and Wilhelmshaven (1908). An early highpoint was the opening in 1912 of the branch in Hamburg's Mönckebergstraße which, with a sales area of around , was the first such department store in a major German city. Karstadt also moved increasingly into the in-house production of clothing, opening a large material store in Berlin in 1911 and a clothing factory in the following year. In addition to this, a factory for the production of men's clothing was opened in Stettin in 1919. In 1920 Karstadt took over the company Althoff from Theodor Althoff of Dülmen and transformed the entire group into a limited company. This meant that the Karstadt Group was now also represented by the Althoff stores in Dülmen (opened 1885), Rheine (1889), Borghorst (1889), Bottrop (1893), Bocholt (1893), Recklinghausen (1893), Essen (1894), Münster (1896), Duisburg (1899), Gladbeck (1901), Lippstadt (1901), Coesfeld (1902), Remscheid (1901), Dortmund (1904) and Leipzig (1914). It was only much later however (1963) that the Althoff stores were given the Karstadt name. The branch network had now expanded to 44 and this number grew further to 89 by 1931. After the First World War, Karstadt expanded rapidly and in July 1926 it established the EPA-Einheitspreis-Aktiengesellschaft with which it created a network of low price department stores. By 1932 there were 52 EPA stores. In addition to this, Karstadt acquired further production facilities in order to reduce further its dependency upon suppliers. These facilities included weaving mills, furnishers, printers and abattoirs. Karstadt department store on Hermannplatz, 1936 In 1929 one of the then-largest department stores in the world was opened on Hermannplatz in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The nine-storey building with around of usable space (at that time KaDeWe had less than initially offered work to 4,000 employees. The monumental building also had two towers, a roof terrace and several truck lifts as well as its own entrance from the underground railway. It soon became clear, however, that the building was over-dimensioned and, in 1932, a number of floors were empty due to the economic crisis. In 1945 the building was blown up by members of the SS. In 1932 Rudolph Karstadt stepped down from the management of the company following the dramatic decline in sales which accompanied the global economic crisis. A restructuring plan included a reduction in the share capital and the closure of numerous branches and production facilities; Epa AG was sold. In the 1930s the company suffered under the ideological reservations about department stores held by National Socialism. Such stores were generally perceived as a “Jewish invention” and were subject to widespread repression. Karstadt AG had to dismiss 830 Jewish employees, including four board members and 47 branch managers. = After the Second World War = After the Second World War, the stores to the east of the Oder and the Neiße, in Königsberg (East Prussia), Cranz (East Prussia), Neustettin (Pomerania), Stettin (Pomerania) and Guben (East Brandenburg) were expropriated – as were those in the Soviet Occupation Zone (including Schwerin, Leipzig, Potsdam, Halle and Görlitz). More than 30 of the remaining 45 stores in the West – including the then “flagships” in Berlin-Kreuzberg (Hermannplatz) and Hamburg (Mönckebergstraße) – had been destroyed or severely damaged. The “economic miracle” of the post-war years enabled the company to recover and in the early 1950s it began to expand. A number of takeovers followed, including that of the Grimme department stores in Schleswig-Holstein in 1970. In 1977 Karstadt acquired a majority share in Neckermann Versand AG and, with an annual turnover of 10.62 billion DM, became the Federal Republic's largest retailer. In the same year, it was decided to close the low-price chain Kepa. In 1984 Neckermann was taken over completely and integrated into the structure of the group. Following German reunification, former Centrum department stores were taken over in Brandenburg an der Havel, Dresden, Halle, Magdeburg, Wismar and Görlitz. In 1994 Karstadt took over the Hertie department stores (which also included KaDeWe). These Hertie department stores initially continued to operate in parallel but they were then progressively transformed into Karstadt stores or closed. The takeover of Hertie also left Karstadt as the owner of a number of properties which the National Socialists had expropriated from the Jewish department store founder Wertheim. In 2005 the Berlin Administrative Court ordered KarstadtQuelle AG to compensate the heirs. In 1999 Karstadt AG and the mail-order company Quelle merged to form KarstadtQuelle AG. =Karstadt department stores after the merger with Quelle= Following the merger with Quelle, the department stores of the former Karstadt AG were operated by Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH (known until 2006 as Karstadt Warenhaus AG), a fully owned subsidiary of KarstadtQuelle and Arcandor AG. In October 2004 it emerged that Karstadt Warenhaus AG and the entire KarstadtQuelle group were in a dramatic financial situation. Karstadt was facing both the difficulties being faced by the entire retail sector and its own home-made problems. The company was continuing to ignore market trends by offering a wide assortment of goods while critics complained that the interiors were outdated and the goods on offer not customer-orientated. Since 1 January 2005, the food departments in currently 67 (and initially 72) of the 90 Karstadt branches have been run by a Cologne-based joint venture known as Karstadt Feinkost GmbH & Co. KG, of which Karstadt owns 74.9% and the Rewe Group 25.1% and of which each company appoints one managing director. Karstadt contributed goods and properties worth around 50 million euros to the company and Rewe the same amount of new capital. Initially, Karstadt Feinkost had around 3,700 employees, most of whom had come from KarstadtQuelle, and generated an annual turnover of around 500 million euros. Until 2007 the joint venture reported annual pre-tax losses in the tens of millions. Ever since the founding of Karstadt Feinkost the departments have been gradually refurbished and repositioned with a modified product range under the new brand Perfetto. The ongoing crisis situation led in August 2005 to the sale of 74 Karstadt branches with sales areas below (Karstadt Kompakt – which was later known as Hertie GmbH and then closed following insolvency), 51 SinnLeffers clothing stores and the specialist retail chain Runners Point. The Karstadt department store properties still owned by KarstadtQuelle were sold in 2006 to the Highstreet consortium of which the group itself owned 49% and Whitehall Funds 51%. In 2008 KarstadtQuelle AG sold its 49% share to a consortium including the Borletti Group, the Generali Group, Pirelli RE and RREEF Alternative Investments. In 2006, in order to mark its 125th anniversary, Karstadt published a celebratory book entitled , which presented the history of the company. Karstadt's book departments have been operated since April 2008 as “shops-in-shops” by DBH Warenhaus (Verlagsgruppe Weltbild/Hugendubel). In Karstadt's premium stores (such as KaDeWe and Karstadt's Hermannplatz store in Berlin) these book departments operate under the “Hugendubel” name and in all others as Weltbild. Further companies who are Karstadt tenants and operate independently while renting Karstadt's checkout/payment system include WMF, Rosenthal Porcelain and the drugstore brand Müller. In October 2007 the Handelsblatt reported that Karstadt was considering taking over the Kaufhof department stores from Metro AG, a deal which would have made the company Europe's second-largest department store group after Spain's El Corte Inglés. In 2008 Gravis announced the abandonment of its unprofitable cooperation with Karstadt in two pilot stores in Düsseldorf and Lübeck which had originally been envisaged for all 90 stores. In the same year Karstadt started cooperating with the fashion designers Kaviar & Gauche and Kostas Murkudis. In May 2009 it was announced that the Metro Group's Kaufhof AG wanted to take over 60 of Karstadt's 90 department stores. In addition to this, liquidity problems meant that the Karstadt parent company Arcandor was no longer able to make rental payments to the Highstreet consortium, the owners of the department store buildings. = Insolvency proceedings and the sale to Berggruen = Karstadt department store in Berlin Karstadt department store in Kiel Arcandor filed for bankruptcy on 9 June 2009. On 12 April 2010 the board of creditors agreed to the insolvency plan proposed by the insolvency administrator Klaus Hubertus Görg which envisaged a sale of the Karstadt department stores as a single entity to an investor and the waiver by the creditors of a large part of their demands. Some municipalities initially refused to agree to the required waiver of business tax payments. Four parties expressed interest in purchasing the Karstadt stores: the German-Swedish investor group Triton, Whitehall together with the Borletti Group and the German financial investor Nicolas Berggruen. Metro AG also expressed interest, but only in the acquisition of certain lucrative and strategically interesting Karstadt stores, which it intended to combine with its own Kaufhof stores into the “Deutsche Warenhaus AG”. On 7 June 2010 nine out of eleven votes were cast by Karstadt's board of creditors in favour of the Berggruen Holding – although the vote was subject to the closing conditions that the Highstreet consortium waived its demand for rental payments. Berggruen signed the purchase contract – primarily conditional upon an agreement with the principal landlord Highstreet – on 8 June 2010. €70 million was named as the purchase and investment price with a further €240 million to be invested in the following three years, for which Berggruen required no external capital. On 30 June 2010 the Federal Cartel Office approved the takeover of the department store chain. After tough negotiations, agreement with the Highstreet consortium regarding rental payments was reached in early September 2010. Berggruen announced the legal division of Karstadt into a parent company and three subsidiary companies in the sectors of sports, premium and other stores. Smaller business divisions were seen as easier to manage and could react more quickly. In addition to this, each division would find it easier to find strategic partners and cooperative ventures. Following an adjustment of the labour agreement covering the restructuring process, Berggruen's Plan was approved by the trade union Verdi. The logistics division of the company, KarstadtQuelle Beschaffungslogistik, continues to operate under the name Corporate Service (Germany) GmbH (CSG). The company offers international purchasing and, in particular, supply-chain solutions. The managing directors of CSG are Marc Baeuerle and Stefan Graetz and the headquarters are in Düsseldorf. Between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012 the group generated losses of €249.6 million, €121 million of which resulted from restructuring measures and, in particular, severance payments to 2,000 employees. In the first seven months of the subsequent trading year sales fell by 7.9%. All general, sports and premium stores were below projections. In May 2013 the company announced a “wage freeze” and, hence, a temporary suspension of the labour agreement until 2015. In September 2013 it was made known that Berggruen was selling 75.1% of both the premium and the sports stores to the Austrian Signa Holding of the investor René Benko. The revenue of 300 million euros was to be used to modernise the Karstadt stores. 150 million euros were available for the general Karstadt stores, of which 15 million should be invested within five years and the further 135 million euros as required. 100 million euros of this revenue from the sale were earmarked for the premium stores and 50 million euros for the sports stores. The 300 million was only to be paid in full within 18 months but half should be paid before the end of the year. In February 2014 Eva-Lotta Sjöstedt became the new managing director and successor to Andrew Jennings, who had been with Karstadt since the beginning of 2011. On 7 July 2014 the company announced the immediate resignation of Sjöstedt. In justifying her move she explained that \\"detailed checks, the experiences of the past few months and a closer knowledge of the economic situation have led me to conclude that the pre-conditions for the path chosen by me no longer exist\\". = Sale to Signa Holding = On 15 August 2014 it was announced that the Vienna-based Signa Holding was taking over the troubled department store chain for one Euro. Signa Holding also acquired the minority shares which had been retained by Nicolas Berggruen in Karstadt Sports GmbH and the Karstadt Premium GmbH, which owns stores including KaDeWe in Berlin, Alsterhaus in Hamburg and Oberpollinger in Munich. Four years ago the Chairman René Benko successfully opened an Austrian chain of department stores which could serve as an example for Karstadt. On 19 August 2014 an ad-hoc statement from Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH announced that the company's former Labour Relations Director and Head of Personnel Kai-Uwe Weitz who, together with the Finance Director Miguel Müllenbach, had been provisionally managing Karstadt since the departure of Eva-Lotta Sjöstedt in July, was also immediately leaving the company “by mutual agreement”.  Company headquarters  The company headquarters was initially located in Wismar before moving to Kiel in 1893 and, in 1912, from Kiel to Steinstraße in Hamburg. From here it moved again in 1932 to Berlin, initially in a new building in the then Königstraße (near Alexanderplatz) and later, in 1936, to a new “tailor-made” headquarters on Fehrbelliner Platz. After the end of the war parts of the administration were transferred to Hamburg, Recklinghausen and Limbecker Platz in Essen. In 1969, after three-years of construction, the headquarters was transferred to its current location in Essen-Bredeney (alongside the A 52).  Competitors  Karstadt's most significant competitor -in terms of department stores- is Kaufhof, owned by Hudson's Bay Company, which it announced in September 2018 plans to merge with. Earlier direct competitors were Hertie and Horten department store chains. Bricks-and-mortar competitors include as C&A;, Peek & Cloppenburg and Saturn. Since the 1960s and 70s competition has increased on “green-field” sites – sites on the edge of cities or in the suburbs. Self- service department stores such as Real, Famila, Plaza and other specialist stores (Adler, Vögele, Vobis, Media Markt) have experienced particularly strong growth. Attempts in the 1970s to establish an in-house self-service division were unsuccessful.  Branches  At the beginning of 2009 there were 90 Karstadt stores in Germany and the company also owned two branches of Schaulandt. The most important stores included KaDeWe (around 60,000 m²) in Berlin, Oberpollinger (around 33,000 m²) in Munich and Alsterhaus (around 24,000 m²) in Hamburg. The original store in Wismar is, with around 3,100 square metres, the smallest. The 180 Fox markets, in which remaindered goods from Karstadt and Quelle were sold, were closed at the end of 2007. These goods were then sold in \\"\\"Karstadt-Schnäppchencenters\\"\\". The closure of Karstadt’s branches in Dortmund (Kampstraße), Munich (am Dom) and in Hamburg’s Elbe Shopping Centre was announced on 10 November 2009. A Schaulandt store in Braunschweig, a branch of WOM in Stuttgart and the Karstadt multimedia store in Berlin-Biesdorf also closed. On 1 October 2011 KaDeWe Berlin, Alsterhaus Hamburg and Oberpollinger Munich and all branches of Karstadt Sports were absorbed into Karstadt Premium GmbH and Karstadt Sports GmbH respectively. This meant that the three premium stores and the sports shops were no longer part of Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH. As part of Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH’s “Karstadt 2015” restructuring programme it was decided to reorient the company's online sales approach. In November 2012 Karstadt announced the relaunch of its online stores in cooperation with Demandware and SinnerSchrader. The branch with the highest sales is the one located next to Munich main station which offers 300,000 products and covers 40,000 square metres. As of 30 July 2016 the company had 114 stores in Germany.  Films  * Mitarbeiter feiern Karstadt-Rettung.

It is situated west of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway, near the Monte Cristo area, on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Debris piles on the mountain's northern flank form as a result of avalanche activity. These fields of disturbed snow are able to remain year round in the shadow of the mountain. During the summer months snow-melt streams flow beneath the debris piles and cause caves to form in the ice. The caves vary in size from season to season and are unpredictably dangerous. The mountain is open to the public and a large snowfield can be reached by a short trail, but the snowfield itself is off-limits due to cave-ins and slides which have killed hikers in incidents in 1998, 2010, and 2015.  History  Big Four is not named for the five peaks on its top. Possible origins for its name include a figure four that is visible in one of its snowfields and a group of four brothers who were known to prospect and trap in the valley. The snow accumulation at the location of the ice caves was known as \\"Rucker's Glacier\\" (not actually a glacier), and is considered the lowest elevation permanent ice in the Cascades. Big Four Inn was a resort near the base of the mountain built by the Rucker Brothers in 1921 until it was destroyed by fire in 1949. The first ascent of Big Four was made July 19, 1931, by Forest Farr and Art Winder via the northwest ridge. Climate Big Four Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross-section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Immediately popular after the poem's publication in 1845, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Some consider it the best poem ever written.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 237 As such, modern references to the poem continue to appear in popular culture. Print * Writer James Russell Lowell, a contemporary of Poe's, references \\"The Raven\\" and its author in his poem, A Fable for Critics: \\"Here comes Poe with his Raven, like Barnaby Rudge, / Three fifths of him genius, two fifths sheer fudge.\\" This mention alludes to the belief that Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty inspired Poe to write \\"The Raven\\". * In Edmund Clerihew Bentley's Trent's Own Case (1913), Trent, standing at an open French door and reciting the fifth stanza to himself, receives an unexpected reply: :\\"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, :Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; :But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, :And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ...\\" :\\"Guv'nor!\\" Will Elder's absurd illustrations of \\"The Raven\\", from Mad Magazine #9, March 1954. * In the magazine Mad issue 9 (March 1954), \\"The Raven\\" is reprinted in full with absurd illustrations by Will Elder. Another parody appeared in a Mad collection, We're Still Using That Greasy MAD Stuff (1959). It was titled as \\"The Spaniel.\\" Rather than \\"Nevermore,\\" the author was bombarded with famous commercial taglines. A more recent parody in Mad by Frank Jacobs, titled \\"The Reagan\\", appeared in issue 265 (September 1986). Even more recently, the poem was used to parody horror movies, and how successful ones often have sequels made that are of low quality. The recurring line is, \\"Quoth Wes Craven, let's make more!\\"Original issue unknown, source: \\"Greasy Mad Stuff\\"; compilation of various pieces from Mad, published by Signet, 1962. pp 132-133. * In the Donald Duck 10-pager \\"Raven Mad\\" by Carl Barks, published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #265 in 1962, Huey, Dewey and Louie play with a raven who can only say \\"Nevermore.\\" As in the poem, the raven often repeats the word throughout the story. * Sections of \\"The Raven\\" are quoted in Hubert Selby Jr's 1964 novel Last Exit to Brooklyn. In the story entitled \\"The Queen is Dead\\" the lead character, Georgette, reads the poem aloud to her acquaintances. * \\"The Raven\\" has been the subject of constrained writing. Georges Perec's novel A Void (1969), written entirely without the letter 'E' in French and subsequently translated into English by Gilbert Adair under the same constraint, contains a full-length \\"translation\\" of \\"The Raven\\" entitled \\"Black Bird.\\" It is attributed to \\"Arthur Gordon Pym.\\"Perec, Georges. A Void. Translated by Gilbert Adair. London: The Harvill Press, 1995. p.108. * Mathematician Mike Keith has also referenced the poem in three examples of constrained writing: **\\"Near a Raven\\" is a reworking of Poe's poem in which the length of words correspond to the first 740 digits of pi (1995) **Cadaeic Cadenza, a longer work under the same constraint, begins with the full text of \\"Near a Raven\\" (1996) **\\"Raven-Two\\", a poetic anagram of the original (1999) * In Joan Aiken's novel Arabel's Raven (1972), as well as further books from the Arabel and Mortimer series, a young girl named Arabel has a pet raven named Mortimer who often says the word \\"Nevermore!\\" Aiken won an Edgar Award in 1972. * The Calvin & Hobbes collection \\"The Essential Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury\\" (released September 1988) contains an original illustrated poem, \\"A Nauseous Nocturne,\\" which is clearly patterned after \\"The Raven.\\" * In Stephen King's novel Insomnia (1994), Ralph compares an omen to the raven of the poem. The novel Black House (2001), written by King and Peter Straub, also features a talking crow reminiscent of the raven in Poe's poem. Part III of the novel is entitled \\"Night's Plutonian Shore.\\" * In Robin Jarvis's Tales from the Wyrd Museum trilogy (1995–1998), Woden has two raven servants named Thought and Memory.

At one point in the series, he flaps his wings and screams, \\"Nevermore!\\", only to explain that he was \\"being Peter Lorre in that one Roger Corman movie\\". * Level Ground Press and artist Bill Fountain published an illustrated re-imagining of \\"The Raven\\" in 2005. The book incorporates raven myths and legends from around the world into the visual interpretation of the story. *Holly Black quotes the poem in her 2005 novel Valiant: A Modern Tale of Faerie, alluding to it as the source for the name of the drug called 'Nevermore'. However, this is later contradicted, when one of the characters asserts that the name comes from the limitations of its use: \\"Never more than once a day, never more than a pinch at a time, and never more than two days in a row.\\" *The fantasy novel The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde features a villainous character named Jack Schitt who is ultimately trapped inside a copy of \\"The Raven\\". *The first of the books based on the hit TV series Supernatural is called Nevermore. Poe is also very important for the rest of the book, as the murders that the main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester are investigating are reenactments of \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" and \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", respectively, and it all turns out to be part of a ritual to bring Poe back to life. *Terry Pratchett's Discworld series contains a talking raven named Quoth, named by a wizard who \\"thought he was funny.\\" Quoth's first injunction to new acquaintances is that he \\"won't say the N-word.\\" * James Patterson's and Chris Tebbet's Middle School: Get Me Out of Here! has a Raven on the cover atop a building screaming \\"Nevermore!\\" Film *\\"The Raven\\" was recreated as a hallucination of Poe's in the 1915 silent film The Raven. A fictionalized biography, it starred Henry B. Walthall as Poe. *The 1935 film The Raven has Bela Lugosi as a Poe-obsessed doctor and costars Boris Karloff. The film has an interpretive dance of \\"The Raven\\". *In 1942, Fleischer Studios created A Cartoon Travesty of The Raven. A two-reel Technicolor cartoon based upon \\"The Raven\\" which turned the story of the poem into a lighthearted comedy. *A Bugs Bunny cartoon, No Parking Hare, has Bugs reading a few lines from the poem, starting with the words, \\"While I nodded nearly napping\\". The comic he reads them from is stated as \\"Poe's Kiddie Comics\\". *In 1963, Roger Corman directed The Raven, a comedy with Boris Karloff and Vincent Price, very loosely based on the poem. *In the 1967 stop-motion film Mad Monster Party, Baron von Frankenstein tests his new potion on a raven, and lets it fly until it lands on a tree branch. Watching the resulting explosion, he says with a chuckle, \\"Quoth the raven... nevermore. Ah, I've done it – created the means to destroy matter!\\" *The stop-motion short film Vincent (1982), by Tim Burton, features a protagonist named Vincent Malloy, whose \\"favorite author is Edgar Allan Poe.\\" As Vincent lies, seemingly dying, at the end of the film, he quotes the final couplet of \\"The Raven\\". *In the 1983 film The Dead Zone, Christopher Walken (as a school teacher Johnny Smith) quotes \\"The Raven\\" to his class during a lesson. *In the 1986 film Short Circuit, the robot Number 5 (voiced by Tim Blaney) makes the comment \\"nevermore\\" in reference to a pet raven of Stephanie Speck's (portrayed by Ally Sheedy). *In the 1989 film Batman, Jack Nicholson (as The Joker) quotes \\"The Raven\\" to Kim Basinger's Vicky Vale when he says, \\"Take thy beak from out my heart.\\" *Hannes Rall directed an animated, German- language version of The Raven (Der Rabe) in 1998. *In the 1994 film The Crow, Eric, the tragic main character, references \\"The Raven\\" after breaking down the door to Gideon's pawn shop: \\"'Suddenly, I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.' You heard me rapping, right?\\" *In the film The Pagemaster, when Richard and his books enter Dr. Jekyll's mansion and the door closes behind them, a raven flies down past them and says \\"Nevermore\\" as it does so. * In the 2001 sequel Dr. Dolittle 2 starring Eddie Murphy, when Dolittle holds a meeting with all the animals about how Archie the bear can help save their forest, most of the animals walk away because Archie seems like an idiot who won't be of much help. An irritated raven flies away saying \\"Nevermore\\". * The poem was translated to film by Trilobite Pictures and director Peter Bradley in 2003. The short film was released on DVD in 2005 by Lurker Films. As of 2012, the full film can be viewed online. *The film Nightmares from the Mind of Poe (2006) adapts \\"The Raven\\" along with three Poe short stories: \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" and \\"The Premature Burial\\". * In the 2005 film The Crow: Wicked Prayer the third sequel to The Crow, during the final battle between Jimmy and Luc, Jimmy tauntingly shouts \\"Quoth the raven nevermore, motherfucker!\\" * In the 2010 film The Expendables, numerous references are made to ravens and, obliquely, to \\"The Raven.\\" The character played by Sylvester Stallone is in the process of getting a tattoo completed which features a raven, and the seaplane which his team travels in also features an oversize picture of a raven. *A film entitled The Raven, which stars a fictionalized Poe, was released in March 2012. Television The Simpsons version of \\"The Raven\\" (3rd segment of the first Treehouse of Horror special): Homer cries out \\"Be that word our sign of parting.\\" *The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" parodies the poem in its third segment as Lisa reads the story to Bart and Maggie. In the animated segment, Homer serves as the protagonist, Bart takes the raven's form, Marge appears in a painting as Lenore and Lisa and Maggie are angels. Bart complains that the poem is not scary, and at one point the raven says his catchphrase \\"Eat my shorts\\" instead of \\"Nevermore.\\" Homer provides the spoken dialogue for the narrator, while James Earl Jones voices his thoughts. Much of the story is cut for time for this segment. The story culminates (after the last two lines of stanza 17 are repeated again) with Homer chasing the Bart-raven around the study before the last stanza (before said last stanza is told, the Bart-raven drops books of other stories by Poe onto Homer). Poe and \\"The Raven\\" are also referenced in the episode \\"Saturdays of Thunder\\", when Dr Nick Riviera appears in an infomercial promoting a cleaning product that will clean dirty grave stones. Troy McClure responds to Riviera with: \\"Quoth the raven, 'What a shine'.\\" *Night Gallery, hosted by Rod Serling, featured a brief, humorous story entitled \\"Quoth the Raven.\\" It featured Poe, portrayed by Marty Allen, being constantly maligned by a talking raven (voiced by uncredited Mel Blanc) on a bust of Pallas as Poe is trying to write the original \\"Raven\\" poem. *Garfield and Friends parodied the poem in the form of a U.S. Acres short titled \\"Stark Raven Mad\\", in which Orson narrates, to the tune of the poem, guarding the harvest against Roy's attempts to steal it. *The Histeria! episode \\"Super Writers\\" featured a sketch in which a Peter Lorre-esque Poe attempts to pitch his poem to Sammy Melman, who wants a brighter poem with a happy narrator and a bunny instead of a raven. This frustrates Poe to no end and eventually drives him to publish the poem independently. Later in the episode, in a sketch featuring Poe as a villain, the raven serves as his sidekick. *Tiny Toon Adventures parodies the poem, with the character Sweetie Pie playing the role of the raven while Vincent Price does the voice-over for the narrator. * The Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain episode \\"The Ravin!\\" parodies the poem, with the Brain narrating and Elmyra using a phrase repetitively. *In the TV show The Addams Family, Morticia uses \\"The Raven\\" as a bed-time story to her son Pugsley, reciting it as a nursery rhyme. (Episode 1.2 \\"Morticia and the Psychiatrist\\", original air date: 25 September 1964) *The 1960s sitcom The Munsters featured a cuckoo clock with a wise-cracking raven (who had named himself \\"Charlie\\") instead of a cuckoo, which would emerge and say, \\"Nevermore, Nevermore\\" – usually as a comic foil for Herman Munster. *The animated series Beetlejuice 4th-season episode \\"Poe Pourri\\" featured Poe as one of the eccentric residents of the Neitherworld who comes to Beetlejuice's Roadhouse searching for his lost Lenore, and with him comes a talking raven who does his verse rapper-style. *An episode of Teen Titans entitled \\"Nevermore\\" follows two of the main characters, Beast Boy and Cyborg, as they use a magical mirror to enter the mind of their friend Raven. *In the Gilmore Girls episode, \\"A Tale of Poes and Fire,\\" \\"The Raven\\" is recited by two men dressed like Edgar Allan Poe for a Poe convention. *In episode 3 of season 4 of Alton Brown's Good Eats (\\"Fry Hard II: The Chicken\\") on Food Network, Brown's prologue to the episode shows him rummaging through his cookbooks (\\"forgotten lore\\") looking for chicken recipes accompanied by a voice-over of him reciting a parody of the first few stanzas of the poem, during which a plastic chicken, taking the raven's place, perched on the bust of Julia Child and repeatedly says \\"Fry some more\\". *The DuckTales character Poe De Spell is a raven who often says \\"nevermore\\". *The Muppet Babies episode \\"Quoth the Weirdo\\" is featured around poetry. Gonzo found much appeal in the spooky atmosphere of \\"The Raven\\". *The Gothic cartoon series Ruby Gloom based on the apparel franchise of the same name features three ravens named Edgar, Allan, and Poe, with Poe being the most prominent. * In one episode of \\"Bullwinkle's Corner\\" from The Bullwinkle Show, the poem parodied is \\"The Raven\\". The bird which comes into Bullwinkle's \\"chamber spooky\\" is a woodpecker instead of the expected raven. Bullwinkle pursues the imposter bird with a fireplace poker and ends up hitting himself on the head. The narration concludes \\"Now the room is round me wavin'/ feels like I've been in a cave-in/ When will next I read \\"The Raven\\"?/I can tell you...nevermore!\\" * In the 11th episode (called \\"Nevermore\\") of television series Warehouse 13, many Poe poems feature, including \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" and, of course, \\"The Raven\\". *In the Star Trek episode \\"Charlie X\\", a youth with strange powers forces Mr Spock to recite the first verse of \\"The Raven\\", after he had moments previously recited the first verse of William Blake's poem \\"The Tyger\\". *In The Following the message \\"Neverwhere\\" is found in multiple murder scenes and the murders are strongly connected to Poe's work. Additionally, Joe Carroll, the series' primary antagonist and an admirer of Poe, says \\"Quoth the raven... Nevermore.\\" as his last words, just prior to his execution by lethal injection. *In the show Mama's Family, the local high school was named for Edgar Allan Poe (Edgar Allan Poe High School), with their team nickname being the Ravens. In an early episode, Vint and Naomi recall their days at EAPHS by singing the school fight song: \\"GO! GO! GO! EDGAR ALLAN POE! We will leave'em weak and weary, we will give'em midnight dreary, will they ever top our score? Quoth the raven, NEVERMORE!\\". *In Teen Wolf, season 6 references it on multiple occasions. The first time shows ravens flying alongside the Wild Hunt in a painting, symbolizing the Wild Hunt's ability to steal souls and take them into the state between life and death. The poem is more obviously referenced in episode 6 (\\"Ghosted\\") with a character named Lenore who refuses to let go of her own past, hallucinating much like the narrator in the poem, bemoaning the loss of someone she loved. *In The 100, season 3 episode \\"Fallen\\", Raven Reyes recites stanza 85-90 in an attempt of sensory overload to block A.L.I.E. from her brain. Also in season 3 is an episode titled \\"Nevermore\\", in which Raven Reyes succeeds in removing A.L.I.E. from her brain. *In Altered Carbon, the AI proprietor of The Raven Hotel is called Poe, whose appearance is similar to Edgar Allen Poe. In the second series, Poe manages The Nevermore Hotel. Music * In 1974, English rock band Queen recorded the song \\"Nevermore\\" based on \\"The Raven\\" for their second album Queen II. *The psychedelic band The Glass Prism released an album in 1969 entitled Poe Through the Glass Prism, with the lyrics coming entirely from various poems by Poe. \\"The Raven\\" was the single from the album. * The band Kennelmus released the song \\"The Raven\\" on their 1971 album Folkstone Prism with lyrics derived from the poem. *The Alan Parsons Project album Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976) includes a song based on \\"The Raven\\" and entitled the same, but with only two verses. * A musical variation of \\"The Raven\\" was performed by the Grateful Dead during Space on April 19, 1982. *The black metal band Carpathian Forest used the first two verses of the poem for \\"The Eclipse / The Raven\\" on their EP Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods (1995). *The gothic metal band Tristania released a track titled \\"My Lost Lenore\\" on Widow's Weeds (1998). It is clearly inspired by this poem, but does not incorporate the poem as part of the lyrics. The entire album is in fact reminiscent of \\"The Raven\\". \\"The Ravens\\" is another song inspired by the poem, although its main theme is terrorism. *The German black metal band Agathodaimon quotes \\"The Raven\\" in the song \\"Les Posédes\\" on their 1999 album Higher Art of Rebellion. *A song based on \\"The Raven\\" appears on the Grave Digger album The Grave Digger (2003), alongside other songs based on the work of Edgar Allan Poe. *Blues Traveler's 1995 hit \\"Run-Around\\" opens with an allusion to the opening line of \\"The Raven\\": \\"Once upon a midnight dreary\\". *Lou Reed's 2003 album The Raven is based on Poe's work, including his own version of The Raven in a song by the same name. *The song Kremlin Dusk, from Japanese pop star Utada Hikaru's English-language album Exodus (2004), begins \\"All along, I was searching for my Lenore/In the words of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe/Now I'm sober and \\"Nevermore\\"/Will the Raven come to bother me at home.\\" It also refers to the \\"dying ember\\" line in the poem. *Seattle, Washington metal band Nevermore got its name from the repeated refrain in \\"The Raven\\". The band also referenced it in the title track from their 2005 album This Godless Endeavor. *The Dutch neoceltic pagan folk band Omnia put a slightly edited version of the poem to music as the second track on their 2007 album Alive!. *The American gothic horror band Nox Arcana released a CD entitled Shadow of the Raven in 2007. Three songs – \\"Midnight Dreary\\", \\"The Raven\\" and \\"Nevermore\\" – as well as the album's title, are direct references to the poem. *The German symphonic metal band Xandria included the quote \\"Thus spoke the raven, 'Nevermore'\\" in their song \\"Ravenheart\\", which is inspired by the poem as well. *The Christian third-wave ska band Five Iron Frenzy quotes many of Poe's lines in \\"That's How The Story Ends\\", from The End Is Near, and alludes ironically to the mysterious and somber mood of \\"The Raven\\". *The song \\"Campanas en la Noche\\" (\\"Bells in the Night\\") by the Argentine rock band Los Tipitos, the tale of a man wishing for the return of his lover, is loosely based on the poem. This relationship is even more evident in the song's video, which features the bust of Pallas and the titular raven itself. *Rapper MC Lars released the track \\"Mr. Raven\\" on The Laptop EP, quoting some lines directly from the poem and modifying others (e.g. \\"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I kicked it weak and weary\\"). *The Canadian artist Nash the Slash included an instrumental track called \\"Lost Lenore\\" on his vinyl album The Million Year Picnic. *Jean Sibelius based an early conception of his fourth symphony on \\"The Raven.\\" *The Devil Wears Prada used a track of a man reading a part of \\"The Raven\\" as a part of an introduction to concerts during a 2008 tour with Underoath. The piece led into the ending breakdown in the song \\"Goats on a Boat\\". *The Dutch based hardstyle artist DJ Pavo released a track entitled \\"Raven\\", which quotes various lines from the poem. *Buddy Morrow and His Orchestra recorded an album of songs based on Poe's works. The album, Poe for Moderns, includes a condensed, jazzy version of \\"The Raven\\". *The hip hop group Cyne included a track called \\"The Raven\\" on their 2009 album Water for Mars. The group paraphrases Poe's famous line in a few cynical lines (e.g. \\"Nevermore said the raven, goodbye to innocence\\"). *Recording artist Natalia Kills released a Halloween inspired, abridged reading of the poem with backing from Space Cowboy for 2009. She then released a version with the full poem for 2010, with no backing from Space Cowboy or vocal effects, instead, there were sound effects to reflect the poem. *Swiss folk metal band Eluveitie released a track titled \\"Quoth the Raven\\" on their 2010 release Everything Remains (As It Never Was) portraying the Raven as the harbinger of death. *A song written by Darren Criss entitled \\"High School Rock Out\\" made a reference to \\"The Raven\\" with the line \\"And you think he might be waiting but behind him is your raven singing 'Nevermore' I'm laying him down\\".http://darren-criss.com/lyrics/highschool.php *The Band known as \\"Circus Contraption\\" had the lyric \\"Nevermore the raven said and then he fell upon his head the poor bird lost his balance in flight\\" in their song \\"We Are All Mad\\". *In his song \\"Now Is Now\\", Reverend Flash uses the line \\"Vainly, I had sought to borrow\\" in a verse which ironically addresses purported plagiarism in the song itself. *Spoken at the end video for the Thirty Seconds to Mars song \\"Hurricane\\" are the lines \\"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before\\". * In 2013, English musician Steven Wilson released The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories), featuring songs based on Edgar Allan Poe's works, with the title track \\"The Raven That Refused to Sing\\" based directly off the poem. *In 2014, the Oregon Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps performed their program entitled \\"Nevermore\\", using selected stanzas from the original poem and using musical selections by Zack Hemsey, Kevin Walczyk, Paul Bissell, Vienna Teng and Samuel Barber. * In 2018, American composer/violinist Edward W. Hardy composed a solo violin piece called \\"Nevermore\\" which was inspired by The Raven. *The Greek Black Metal band Rotting Christ released a track titled \\"The Raven\\" on their 2019 album The Heretics. The song's lyrics feature excerpts from the poem. * Russian Goth Rock band \\"Raven Said\\", whose name and oeuvre are inspired by this and other works of Edgar Allan Poe. Other An 1890 political cartoon from Puck Magazine depicts The Raven as Secretary of State James G. Blaine watching President Benjamin Harrison. *The video game Eternal Darkness for the GameCube opens with a quote from \\"The Raven\\": \\"Deep into that darkness peering/Long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting...\\" A large theme of the game is the characters' slowly collapsing sanity. It sets up the games \\"sanity meter\\" mechanic where things in the game itself make less and less sense as your sanity depletes: walls start to bleed, screams are heard. Sometimes the game will make the player think the game itself has reset and will show you the quote again appearing to show that the player lost all his or her progress only for the screen to flash and put you right back where he or she was were as if nothing happened. *In the interactive fiction game by Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging, Part II begins with a line from the poem: \\"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, / Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before...\\" *Lord Buckley recorded a \\"hipsemantic\\" version of \\"The Raven\\" in 1956 (\\"It was a real drugged midnight... dreary.\\"). *Computer scientist Guy L. Steele, Jr. wrote a parody entitled \\"The HACTRN\\" about a hacker haunted by a phantom process.Computer songs and poems: The HACTRN *The Raven Society, founded in 1904, is the University of Virginia's most prestigious honor society, combining requirements of high-level scholarship, service, leadership, and \\"promise of further advancement in the intellectual field.\\" New members must supply a parody of the poem for initiation, which takes place in the room where Poe lived when studying at the University, now under the curatorship of the Society. The Society also maintains several other Poe sites, including the grave marker of his mother Eliza Poe in Richmond, Virginia.Raven Society *Professional wrestler Raven (Scott Levy) has used the stage name Raven from the title of the poem since he joined ECW, and often quotes from the poem in interviews, ending with \\"...Quoth the Raven...Nevermore...\\" *The comic strip Shoe ran a strip in which a large, strange, black bird was sitting at Roz's bar, uttering random words starting with \\"never-\\" or ending in \\"-more\\" (e.g., \\"Livermore!\\"; \\"Nevertheless!\\"), when one of the regular characters announced that the raven was bombed. *Poe lived in Baltimore for a time and is buried there. Residents of the city elected to honor Poe by naming their National Football League team the Baltimore Ravens after the poem. Furthermore, the three mascots for the team are three ravens, appropriately named \\"Edgar\\", \\"Allan\\" and \\"Poe.\\" For many years, pre-game introductions of the Ravens' starting lineup would be preceded by a stanza from the poem, usually one which ended with the word \\"Nevermore,\\" referring to the opposing team's putative inability to score when facing the powerful Raven defense. In 2000, when the Ravens were on their way to winning their first Super Bowl primarily on the strength of that record-setting defense, Chris Berman of ESPN's NFL PrimeTime would often punctuate highlights of the team's results that day by saying, \\"Quoth the Ravens, Never score!\\". Another example is the all-haiku 2008 NFL season preview of ESPN.com columnist Gregg Easterbrook (who often calls the team the \\"Nevermores\\" in his column), which reads: \\"Awk! No offense. Awk! / Quoth the raven: \\"No offense.\\" / Bal-a-mer Ravens\\". *In another PC game, Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships, if you find pieces of paper in the bottles while sailing, they will be automatically pieced together to form a passage from \\"The Raven\\", the one just before the raven appears. Certain letters in red will tell you to go to and dive to one of the sunken ships where the sharks are, and, using the metal detector from Johnny Rolle, you will find an Easter egg. This is also a reference of the next game, Warnings at Waverly Academy, as Corine mentions that she is a Poe fan, as well as Leela having the missing Poe book, \\"The Black Cat and Other Stories\\", which includes \\"The Raven\\" and other works, as well as the pendulum challenge, a reference of \\"The Pit and The Pendulum, which is also in Leela's book. *RavenCon, an annual science fiction convention in Richmond, Virginia, was named in honor of Poe, who grew up in Richmond. *In the video game mod Defense of the Ancients, a hero is named Nevermore, after the word the raven sequentially spoke. Nevermore the Shadow Fiend is a demon who collects and traps the souls of his enemies and his ultimate ability Requiem of Souls, releases the souls collected into an area to damage his enemies in a line. In the stand-alone sequel Dota 2, his description is reminiscent of the poem; his background story says Nevermore has the soul of a poet, as well as warriors, criminals, slaves, and priests. *In the game League of Legends, the champion Swain uses ravens for his attacks. He carries a raven on his shoulder that attacks his enemies. He can turn himself into a giant raven surrounded by smaller ones for a short time. He also has a spell called Nevermove which immobilizes his enemies. *The original version of Epcot's Journey Into Imagination included an open book with the shadow of the raven in the \\"Tales of Terror\\" sequence. *Variations using the DOS error message \\"Abort, Retry, Ignore?\\" were written in the 1980s and 90s and were quite popular, distributed by bulletin board and email. The original and best known version has been credited to Cleveland poet Marcus Bales. It has been adapted numerous times, attributed to Anonymous, Lucy Blades, Rob Collins, and others. *A Penny Arcade comic parodies the poem by making the raven say \\"Jersey Shore\\" as a comment on the ad supported Amazon Kindle. * The webcomic xkcd parodies the poem by playing on the term \\"rapping\\", showing the first stanza followed by a picture of popular rapper Eminem * A parody of the poem appears upon the poker forum operated by Two Plus Two Publishing in the Bing Bland Blaow thread. The parody was subsequently made into a YouTube video. *In the universe of Warhammer 40.000, Corvus Corax, the primarch of the Raven Guard legion of the Space Marines, says \\"Never more\\" as his last words before he goes into the Eye of Terror and never returns. *A style of parody on messageboards involves mimicking the style of the poem to some degree, with the line \\"quoth the raven 'never more' replaced by \\"quoth the server, '404'\\", referencing a commonly seen http error code *A parody by John A.

All division rings, and thus all fields, are quasifields. Definition A quasifield (Q,+,\\\\cdot) is a structure, where + and \\\\cdot \\\\, are binary operations on Q, satisfying these axioms : * (Q,+) \\\\, is a group * (Q_{0},\\\\cdot) is a loop, where Q_{0} = Q \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\, * a \\\\cdot (b+c)=a \\\\cdot b+a \\\\cdot c \\\\quad\\\\forall a,b,c \\\\in Q (left distributivity) * a \\\\cdot x=b \\\\cdot x+c has exactly one solution \\\\forall a,b,c \\\\in Q, a eq b Strictly speaking, this is the definition of a left quasifield. A right quasifield is similarly defined, but satisfies right distributivity instead. A quasifield satisfying both distributive laws is called a semifield, in the sense in which the term is used in projective geometry. Although not assumed, one can prove that the axioms imply that the additive group (Q,+) is abelian. Thus, when referring to an abelian quasifield, one means that (Q_0, \\\\cdot) is abelian. Kernel The kernel K of a quasifield Q is the set of all elements c such that : * a \\\\cdot(b \\\\cdot c)=(a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c\\\\quad \\\\forall a,b\\\\in Q * (a+b) \\\\cdot c=(a \\\\cdot c)+(b \\\\cdot c)\\\\quad \\\\forall a,b\\\\in Q Restricting the binary operations + and \\\\cdot to K, one can shown that (K,+,\\\\cdot) is a division ring. One can now make a vector space of Q over K, with the following scalar multiplication : v \\\\otimes l = v \\\\cdot l\\\\quad \\\\forall v\\\\in Q,l\\\\in K As a finite division ring is a finite field by Wedderburn's theorem, the order of the kernel of a finite quasifield is a prime power. The vector space construction implies that the order of any finite quasifield must also be a prime power. Examples All division rings, and thus all fields, are quasifields. The smallest quasifields are abelian and unique. They are the finite fields of orders up to and including eight. The smallest quasifields which are not division rings are the four non-abelian quasifields of order nine; they are presented in and . Projective planes Given a quasifield Q, we define a ternary map \\\\scriptstyle T\\\\colon Q\\\\times Q\\\\times Q\\\\to Q \\\\, by T(a,b,c)=a \\\\cdot b+c \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b,c\\\\in Q One can then verify that (Q,T) satisfies the axioms of a planar ternary ring. Associated to (Q,T) is its corresponding projective plane. The projective planes constructed this way are characterized as follows; the details of this relationship are given in . A projective plane is a translation plane with respect to the line at infinity if and only if any (or all) of its associated planar ternary rings are right quasifields. It is called a shear plane if any (or all) of its ternary rings are left quasifields. The plane does not uniquely determine the ring; all 4 nonabelian quasifields of order 9 are ternary rings for the unique non- Desarguesian translation plane of order 9. These differ in the fundamental quadrilateral used to construct the plane (see Weibel 2007). History Quasifields were called \\"Veblen-Wedderburn systems\\" in the literature before 1975, since they were first studied in the 1907 paper (Veblen-Wedderburn 1907) by O. Veblen and J. Wedderburn.

Modern winter guard is a competitive, performance-based activity which incorporates choreographed staging, dance, and manipulation of equipment such as flags and prop rifles and sabres (also known as \\"spinning\\"). Unlike traditional color guard, winter guard performances and contests are held indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances typically last 3 to 7 minutes and are accompanied by recorded soundtracks rather than live music. However, the use of live instrumentation (acoustic and electronic) and vocalization have grown in popularity. Winter guard is most present in the United States; independent units have also been formed in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Winter guard ensembles often perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by Winter Guard International, host of the annual Winter Guard International World Championships in Dayton, Ohio. The World Championships event purportedly attracts in 60,000 visitors to the event annually. Scoring attempts to rank units on the repertoire and achievement of aspects of each performance such as unity, quality, range, precision, skill, design, and effect. Team roles A winter guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement choreography in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director. A winter guard team usually has one or multiple captains who serve as leaders as well as performing members. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies. Most regional color guard circuits adopt the minimum and maximum performer requirements set by WGI, which varies by division. The Independent World classification has no maximum number of performers. Performance conventions The duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time. Unlike traditional color guard teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a marching band or drum corps, winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music. In competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves. Judges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn. Equipment Three primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres. Flags may appear in a variety of sizes and formats. Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity. =Flags= Winter guard show at Center Grove High School in Greenwood, Indiana, 2012 Arguably, the foundational equipment in color guard or winter guard is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot metal, fiberglass, or plastic pole with a 36 inch tall by 54 in wide silk, often including custom sewn or digitally printed designs. Flags with shorter poles and larger silks, called \\"swing flags\\", are popular for creating large visual impact as performers can manipulate two flags at once. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material. =Rifles= Shaped similar to actual rifles, the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2-5 pounds (about 1-2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30-39 inches (about 76-99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts: # The neck of the rifle. The neck is where the trigger would be on a firearm rifle. Right-handed drop-spins are performed using the neck of the rifle as the axis for the spin, and the neck is also used in common tosses. # The bolt is a long silver or black strip of metal or plastic connected to the body of the rifle by screws, made to look like the bolt on a firearm. # The body of the rifle is the middle section and the majority of the mass of the rifle. # The strap, a long leather strap that reaches from the butt end of the rifle to about two-thirds of the way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has functional and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling. # The swivel or clip is the metal piece that attaches the strap to the body of the rifle. This is the most common location for left-hand placement when executing a regular left-handed toss. # The final part of the rifle is the butt, the heavier, back end of the rifle. # The \\"tip\\" is at the end of the thin, long part of the rifle and is located on the opposite side of where the \\"butt\\" is. Rifles can be made out of both wood and plastic. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.  Plastic rifles  Plastic rifles tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the user's hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture's guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called polyethylene, this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performer's hands.  Wooden rifles  Wooden rifles can be more challenging to use because each rifle is slightly different and may not be weighted precisely the same. Most wooden rifles are made of either poplar or aspen wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. Electrical tape is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time. =Sabres= Sabres are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30-39 inches (about 76-99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade. These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive. Sabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a \\"spotter\\", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members. Dance Guard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dances are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows. Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show. Winter Guard International Winter Guard International is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly. Because this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every winter guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi- finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area. The phrase \\"Sport of the Arts\\" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying \\"it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format.\\" Divisions and classes Because not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this. There are two divisions, Scholastic and Independent. These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World, Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class. Guard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or \\"bumped\\", to the class above its current position, even mid-season. The Scholastic division is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding. In the Scholastic division, there are three classes: Scholastic A, Scholastic Open, and Scholastic World. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called Cadet. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams. The Independent division is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender- specific or to only have certain numbers of members. In the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: Independent A, Independent Open and Independent World. The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year. Winter guard circuits Although the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the Mid-York Colorguard Circuit, established in 1965. Another is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007.MidWest Color Guard Circuit They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as Cadet, Novice, B, Regional AAA, Regional AA, Regional A, and Regional Open. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not. In addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the European Indoor Arts Alliance (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.

He was Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command from 1949 to 1953. Early life and career Basil Embry was born in Gloucestershire, England, in 1902 and as a young boy at Bromsgrove School he developed an avid interest in aviation. In 1921 he joined the Royal Air Force with a short service commission as an Acting Pilot Officer. In 1922 he was sent to Mandatory Iraq, serving under future Air Marshals Arthur Harris and Robert Saundby. By 1926 Embry's enthusiasm, professional application, boundless energy and flair for the unconventional had put him on the fast track for promotion within the RAF, and he was rewarded with the Air Force Cross in that year's New Year Honours, and appointment to a permanent commission. Promoted to flight lieutenant, Embry returned to Britain in 1927 and soon became an instructor at the Central Flying School, Uxbridge. \\"Air Chief Marshal Sir Basil Embry (09252)\\", 3 August 2019, Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation In 1934 he was posted to India to serve in the Indian Wing on the North West Frontier. He was promoted Squadron Leader in 1935, and served in the Second Mohmand Campaign of 1935. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for operations in Waziristan in 1938. He was further promoted in 1938 to wing commander. After five years' service he returned to Britain in 1939. On the outbreak of the Second World War Embry was Commanding Officer of No. 107 Squadron flying the Bristol Blenheim bomber. Second World War The energetic Embry led his squadron from the front, and he saw extensive action during the campaigns in Norway and France, often in the face of heavy losses and overwhelming opposition. On 25 September 1939 Embry led a 3-plane formation on a reconnaissance sortie into Germany. Intercepted by German fighters, Embry's aircraft suffered serious damage to wings and fuselage and he carried out a one-wheel forced landing on returning to RAF Wattisham in Suffolk. Throughout the remainder of 1939 and into early 1940 the unit made numerous attacks by day and night on a variety of targets, including U-Boats. On 6 April 1940 RAF photo-reconnaissance revealed that a German naval force, including the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, was at anchor off Wilhelmshaven. Embry and his 107 Squadron crews were soon involved in a series of attacks on these ships. With the German invasion of Norway, 107 Squadron were detached to Scotland, and there carried out ten raids in just eight days on Stavanger and airfields in the area, often in treacherous weather conditions. Embry suffered from frostbite during this time. In April 1940 Embry was awarded a Bar to his DSO. The German invasion of France and the Low Countries began on 10 May 1940 and Embry's Squadron flew intensively against the German advance, each crew flying two or three sorties daily across the English Channel to France. His leadership and personal gallantry resulted in the award of a second Bar to his DSO. On 12 May he led No. 107 Squadron and No. 110 Squadron RAF in an attack on two heavily defended bridges across the Albert Canal at Maastricht; the formation was savaged by ground fire and intercepted by numerous Messerschmitt fighters, losing seven Bristol Blenheims from the original force of 24. Two No. 107 Squadron aircraft crash-landed at Wattisham, and every surviving Blenheim had suffered some damage. Due to the tremendous pressure of his operational flying in recent months Embry was then ordered to take an operational 'rest' and was given command of RAF West Raynham, with a promotion to Group Captain. He was to fly one more sortie before relinquishing command. On 27 May 1940, Embry was shot down from by anti-aircraft fire over Saint-Omer during a low-level bombing mission against advancing German Army columns. His aircraft crashed at Eperlecques. Of his crew, observer Pilot Officer T.A. Whiting was made prisoner while Air Gunner Corporal G.E. Long was killed. Captured by the German Army, Embry was being marched away in column of Allied prisoners when he saw a road sign Embry, 3 km. Taking this as a good omen, he rolled down a bank unnoticed by the column's guards and made his escape. He successfully evaded recapture for two months in occupied France before eventually getting back to England via Spain and Gibraltar. His adventures while on the run are detailed in the book Wingless Victory by Anthony Richardson and originally published in 1950.See Bibliography After two months' sick leave, Embry was posted to No. 6 Group as Senior Air Staff Officer with the rank of Group Captain. After only three weeks he was offered command of a night-fighter wing in RAF Fighter Command, which was accepted, although he reverted to the rank of wing commander. The wing disbanded in December 1940 and Embry became AOC RAF Wittering, returning to the rank of group captain in March 1941. Embry kept his hand in operationally by flying radar-equipped night-fighters with No. 25 Squadron. In July 1941 Embry was given the ceremonial title of an Air Aide-de-Camp to the King, and was Mentioned in Despatches in September. In October 1941 he was seconded to the Desert Air Force as an adviser and saw action in the North Africa campaign. Embry returned to Britain in March 1942 and served as AOC Wittering again and as AOC No. 10 Group, Fighter Command. In June he was again Mentioned in Despatches, but he was passed over as the prime candidate for leading RAF Bomber Command's newly formed Pathfinder Force in July 1942, before being given command of No. 2 Group Bomber Command, which was about to join the Second Tactical Air Force (2AF), in June 1943. Although he was now an Air Vice Marshal, Embry continued to fly on operations where possible, usually as a 'wingman' in a formation and flying under the name of \\"Wing Commander Smith\\". By piloting each type of aircraft in his service, he felt better able to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the tools available to his aircrews. This ensured that the men under Embry's command were aware that he was willing to take the same risks they were taking, and he was well liked by them. However, within the Air Ministry's hierarchy his frank, unguarded criticisms made few friends. He pushed fervently for 2 Group's re-equipment with the high-speed De Havilland Mosquito FB VI, which became the highly potent workhorse of the group by 1944. By October 1943, Embry's efforts had made 2 Group highly effective, with its precision daylight bombing and serviceability rates among the best in the Allied Air Forces. The group bombed V-1 flying bomb launch sites in France and transport targets before the Allied landings in Normandy June 1944. In December 1944, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Embry's Mosquitoes undertook further bombing operations such as the attack on Amiens jail in February 1944. On 31 October 1944, Embry took part in a successful low-level attack by Mosquitoes of Nos. 21, 464 and 487 Squadrons in the Aarhus Air Raid targeting the Aarhus University, Denmark, which housed the Gestapo HQ for the whole of Jutland. In March 1945, Embry's command carried out Operation Carthage on the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen, and in April those in Odense. The three operations led to Embry being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for \\"...(pressing) home his attacks with a skill and gallantry in keeping with his outstanding reputation..\\" He was also honoured after the war by the Danish Government for his part in these operations, being awarded the Commander 1st Class of the Order of Dannebrog. On 20 July 1945 he was awarded a third Bar to his DSO. Other nations to honour Embry included the Netherlands (Grand Officer with Swords of the Order of Orange Nassau) and France (Croix de guerre, Commander of the Legion of Honour). Post-war career and later life Shortly after the end of the war Embry was knighted with his appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was later to receive further knighthoods with higher precedence: in 1952 he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and in 1956 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. He was Commander-in-Chief Fighter Command from 1949 to 1953. Embry was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Allied Air Forces Central Europe. His outspoken criticism of the NATO chain of command and organisation framework ensured however that he was retired early from the Royal Air Force in 1956. In 1956 Embry briefly relocated to New Zealand where he wrote his autobiography, titled Mission Completed. In March 1956, accompanied by his wife Hope, he emigrated to Western Australia and began a new life as a sheep farmer, purchasing a property at Chowerup. He also acquired land at Cape Riche, east of Albany, and moved there in the late 1960s. Embry became active in the politics of agriculture through the Farmers' Union of Western Australia. He was elected General President in 1971 and held office for two years. In 1972 he led a delegation through South-east Asia and instigated the establishment of the Rural Traders Co-operative (W.A.) Ltd. He was the president of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society and worked himself at a punishing pace until he became ill in 1975. Embry died in Boyup Brook, Western Australia in 1977, and was survived by his wife, daughter, and three of his four sons. \\"He was both charming and rude, prejudiced and broad-minded, pliable and obstinate, dedicated and human.\\" (Group Captain Peter Wykeham, No 2 Group 1944–45) On 19 April 2007 Spink auctioned the medal group of Air Chief Marshal Sir Basil Embry, selling for £155,350 to Michael Naxton, an agent.Medals of Unremitting R.A.F.

It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting. Method The three color dyes in typical color film emulsions are largely transparent to infrared light, so the infrared image is almost uniformly clear, unlike the RGB images. On the other hand, dust absorbs and scratches scatter the infrared. Any dust spots or scratches appear as dark marks in the infrared, making them easy to find and compensate for. Pixels that are partially occluded (for example, the dust only obscures a small portion of the pixel) may be corrected by scaling. The infrared pixel value indicates the fractional amount of the occlusion, and RGB values can be scaled appropriately. If most or all of a pixel is occluded, scaling is not feasible. Instead, the pixel value may be interpolated from nearby good pixels (inpainting). Infrared cleaning is not possible with media which are not transparent to infrared. In particular the silver particles in silver halide black-and-white film respond equally to visible and infrared light, with no difference between dark pixels and dust, and infrared cleaning is not possible. Infrared cleaning does work with chromogenic black-and-white films, which do not contain silver particles. Some film dyes also block infrared to a considerable extent; infrared cleaning works with Ektachrome slide film, but it is more difficult to find dust spots with the infrared-blocking dyes used in Kodachrome. Some software algorithms, such as the latest ICE implementation (Nikon Super Coolscan LS-9000 ED with Digital ICE ProfessionalCreativePro - Bit by Bit: New Scanner Gives Life to Old Film by Brian P. Lawler (Photographer)), VueScan'shttp://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/vuescan.htm and SilverFast's,http://www.silverfast.com/highlights/isrd/en.html claim to use infrared cleaning to find dust spots even when scanning Kodachrome. Infrared scanning Scanners use three different techniques for doing this: * Nikon film scanners use four colored light-emitting diodes which are pulsed on and off, one at a time. These LEDs are pulsed on and off at each scan position, the light is gathered by a linear array and then the CCD is moved to the next scan line. * Minolta film scanners use a constant visible light source with a pulsed infrared light source. At each scan position, the scanner uses an RGB linear array to scan the film in RGB and RGB+Infrared. This is as fast as the Nikon approach, since only one physical pass over the film needs to be done. * Flatbed scanners and some film scanners have two different light sources, an RGB light source and an infrared light source. These scanners make two passes over the film - once for RGB and once for infrared. This is slower than the Nikon or Minolta approach, since two passes need to be made over the film. It also produces lower quality since software methods need to be used to align the two passes. In addition, the two light sources usually have a different focus position and produce images that are stretched in the CCD direction, which results in another source of lower quality. History IBM originally developed and patented infrared cleaning, and subsequently licensed this patent to Applied Science Fiction (ASF). Canon had a patent cross-licensing agreement with IBM, and thus was able to use IBM's infrared cleaning patent. Canon could not use the trademarked Digital ICE name, so instead called it Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement (FARE). Other companies, including Hamrick Software and LaserSoft Imaging, independently developed infrared cleaning algorithms which are completely different from IBM's patented algorithm. ASF subsequently went out of business, having spent all their money trying to develop dry film development in a kiosk at a time when digital photography was replacing film. Kodak purchased the assets of ASF, but did not use any of its technologies. References * . IR dust removal patent.

Under the present definition of a planet, Jupiter is counted as the fifth.  Hypotheses  There are three main ideas regarding hypothetical planets between Mars and Jupiter. = Asteroids = During the early 19th century, as asteroids were discovered, they were considered planets. Jupiter became the sixth planet with the discovery of Ceres in 1801. Soon, three more asteroids, Pallas (1802), Juno (1804), and Vesta (1807) were discovered. They were counted as separate planets, despite the fact that they shared an orbit as defined by the Titius–Bode law. Between 1845 and 1851, eleven additional asteroids were discovered and Jupiter had become the twentieth planet. At this point, astronomers began to classify asteroids as minor planets. Following the reclassification of the asteroids in their own group, Jupiter became the fifth planet once again. With the redefinition of the term planet in August 2006, Ceres is now considered a dwarf planet. = Disruption theory = The disruption theory suggests that a planet which was positioned between Mars and Jupiter was destroyed, resulting in the asteroid belt between these planets. Scientists in the 20th century dubbed this hypothetical planet \\"Phaeton\\". Today, the Phaeton hypothesis, superseded by the accretion model, has been discarded by the scientific community; however, some fringe scientists regard this theory as credible and even likely. = Planet V theory = Based on simulations, NASA space scientists John Chambers and Jack Lissauer have proposed the existence of a planet between Mars and the asteroid belt, going in a successively eccentric and unstable orbit, 4 billion years ago. They connect this planet, which they name Planet V, and its disappearance with the Late Heavy Bombardment episode of the Hadean era. Chambers and Lissauer also claim this Planet V most probably ended up crashing into the Sun. Unlike the disruption theory's fifth planet, \\"Planet V\\" is not credited with creating the asteroid belt.  Fifth planet in fiction  The concept of a fifth planet which had been destroyed to make the asteroid belt, as in the Disruption Theory, has been a popular one in fiction.

He is prominent for being one half of the now reunited hip-hop duo the Cali Agents and is currently a member of the groups Gold Chain Military and Durag Dynasty. He is also well known for his vast discography of mixtapes. History Originally from Fresno, California, Planet Asia moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1998 and began working with local producer, Fanatik. Between 1997 and 2001, Planet Asia released several 12\\" singles, including \\"Definition of Ill\\" (Stones Throw) and \\"Place of Birth\\" (ABB Records). He reached full acclaim in 2001 when The Source gave him the First Round Draft Pick and Independent Album of the Year awards for How the West Was One. How The West Was One was recorded with fellow rapper Rasco under the group name Cali Agents and landed him a deal with Interscope Records. While signed to Interscope Records, Planet Asia was not promoted much and stayed with Interscope until 2003 without releasing an album. He was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2002 for the song \\"W\\" by Mystic. In 2003, Avatar Records signed Planet Asia and in 2004 released Planet Asia's debut album, The Grand Opening, to positive feedback. It earned him another Independent Album of the Year award from The Source. Avatar also released 12\\" vinyl records including \\"Summertime In The City\\" b/w \\"G's & Soldiers\\" featuring Kurupt produced by J. Wells, \\"Its All Big\\" b/w \\"Right or Wrong\\", and \\"Real Niggaz\\" featuring Ghostface. His record \\"G's & Soldiers\\" featuring Kurupt was prominently featured in John Travolta's 2005 film Be Cool released by MGM. After leaving Avatar, Planet Asia started his own record label, Gold Chain Music, with Walt Liquor. His next album, The Medicine, was released on October 3, 2006, on ABB Records and produced by Evidence of Dilated Peoples, along with co-production credits from The Alchemist, Nucleus and Bravo.

U6 The Pebl U6 was announced in early 2005. Pebl is named for its small and sleek appearance, as well as to evoke comparisons to a \\"pebble,\\" which has been worn smooth over time. The U6 sold in the millions of units. =Design and appearance= Motorola U6 (Open) The body of the Pebl U6 is primarily made out of metal, although everything other than the hinge has a colour coating which makes it matte rather than shiny. The external texture is polished but not quite smooth, resisting finger prints and smudges. Buttons and connectors are kept flush in order to maintain the phone's smooth appearance. In contrast to many other products with a one line external display, the external screen is mounted vertically, rather than horizontally. The unit is held closed by magnets, and can be opened with a single hand by pushing the lid of the phone away from the hinge mechanism. The hinge itself is spring-loaded, so that when cracked it actively swings fully open. Initially, the product was available only in black, but in the second quarter of 2006, Motorola launched four additional colours. It was produced in black, blue, green, red, orange and pink, although the exact colour selection varied per country. Shortly before the new colors became available, Motorola commissioned photographer David LaChapelle to capture the new Pebl phones in a colourful photo shoot. =Additional features= * Java ME MIDP 2.0 compatible * MMS, Wireless Village instant messaging and e-mail * Motorola SCREEN3 push technology for dynamic news and content * MPEG-4 video and JPEG still image capture * Speaker-independent voice dialing * WAP 2.0 web browser * Integrated speakerphone (handsfree) U9 Three years later, the U9 was released.

Lambeg (historically Lanbeg, )Placenames NI is a small village and civil parish in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Located between Belfast and Lisburn, it was once a small rural village, but is now within the Greater Belfast conurbation. Lambeg is also an electoral ward of Lisburn Council. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 60 people. The civil parish of Lambeg covers areas of County Down as well as County Antrim. History Lambeg was originally one townland, but was split into Lambeg North (188 acres, in the barony of Belfast Upper) and Lambeg South (187 acres, in the barony of Massereene Upper). The old village of Lambeg was in the northern half.Ordnance Survey Ireland: Online map viewer (choose \\"historic\\" to see townland boundaries) The River Lagan flows alongside the village and it was because of the river and the damp climate of the Lagan Valley, that flax was first grown there. This resulted in Lambeg becoming a centre for the Linen industry in the area. The fertile land of the Lagan Valley was part of the manor granted in 1611 to Sir Fulke Conway. English tenants, mainly from the north of England according to Rankin, were brought over by Conway to settle on his estate. It is suggested that they also brought experience of textile making with them. The earliest documentary evidence of the textile industry in Lambeg records the setting up of a bleach green in 1626. alt=A low, stone arch bridge with eight consecutive arches in view. By 1760, Mr John Williamson owned most of the village and played a prominent role in the development of the linen trade, through ownership of the Lambeg bleach green. The Wolfendens were another foreign family who went into exile in Lambeg and assisted in the establishing of the manufacture of linen cloth in the village. The bridge over the River Lagan is still referred to as Wolfenden's Bridge. The Wolfenden family are buried in Lambeg graveyard. Lambeg church itself is generally accepted to be on the site of an early monastic settlement.Watson (2008), pp. 45–46 A church is recorded as being present here in 1598, but it has been rebuilt at least twice, including in 1737 (to which the current tower still dates) and in 1849, when most of the current Church of Ireland building was built. Also buried in the graveyard are the Reverend John Johnson and his wife Dorothea Johnson, who both led the Methodist Chapel that was on Market Street in Lisburn.alt=A stone church, with a square tower, and a field of cows in the foreground. Aberdelghy was a mid-19th century two storey house in Lambeg. It was the seat of Alexander Airth Richardson, the son of Jonathan Richardson (MP), of Lambeg, and his wife, Margaret Airth. Leigh's New Pocket Road-Book of Ireland, published 1827, states: In 1920 the Government of Northern Ireland set up a \\"Linen Industry Research Association\\" (LIRA) in Glenmore House, a 17-18th century manor house,Watson (2008), pp. 11–12Watson (2008), p. 26 for the scientific and technical research of textiles, especially linen. Due to the decline of the industry the centre closed in 1993, although its library of books and journals are now housed in the Lisburn Museum. Glenmore House has been converted into residential apartments. Other locally significant buildings include Lambeg Old National School (1849), which is now converted to a dwelling and is a listed building. The Lambeg drum is named after Lambeg.

A hardcover edition of Eos is published once each year and contains the articles, news, and editorials from the tabloid issues. Eos accepts both display and classified advertising.  History  Transactions of the American Geophysical Union began publication as proceedings of the organization's meetings. In 1920, the first volume was reprinted from volume 6, number 10 of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as National Research Council Reprint and Circular Series, number 11, and appeared under the title Scientific papers presented before the American Geophysical Union. It compiled papers from the AGU's second annual meeting. AGU's fourth and sixth through ninth annual meetings were also published as bulletins of the National Research Council. The third and fifth annual meetings were devoted to discussion and no scientific papers presented. These transactions were not printed but were mimeographed for limited distribution only. The current name of the publication is taken from Eos, the Greek goddess of dawn, representing for AGU the new light continually being shed by basic geophysical research on the understanding of Earth and its environment in space. The name was added in 1969. Abstracting and indexing Eos is indexed by GeoRef, GEOBASE, Scopus, PubMed, and several other databases. It is a GeoRef priority journal.

However, this episode focuses less on Disneyland itself and more on the many celebrity singers at the different sections of the park, including the Osmond Brothers, former Mouseketeers Annette Funicello and Bobby Burgess, teen heartthrob Bobby Rydell, Monette Moore, and Louis Armstrong. In a running gag, Walt Disney introduces but is unable to attend these attractions and performances, being pinned down by an endless supply of autograph seekers (including a repeat customer) throughout the program.

A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat and sometimes electronic warfare while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft. Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in aerial warfare and dogfighting (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an ace.  Recruitment  Fighter pilots are one of the most highly regarded and desirable positions of any air force. Selection processes only accept the elite out of all the potential candidates. An individual who possesses an exceptional academic record, physical fitness, healthy well-being, and a strong mental drive will have a higher chance of being selected for pilot training. Candidates are also expected to exhibit strong leadership and teamwork abilities. As such, in nearly all air forces, fighter pilots, as are pilots of most other aircraft, are commissioned officers.  Fitness  Female USAF fighter pilots heading to their jets before takeoff (2006) Fighter pilots must be in optimal health to handle the physical demands of modern aerial warfare. Excellent heart condition is required, as the increased \\"G's\\" a pilot experiences in a turn can cause stress on the cardiovascular system. One \\"G\\" is equal to the force of gravity experienced under normal conditions, two \\"G\\"s would be twice the force of normal gravity. Some fighter aircraft can accelerate to up to 9 G’s. Fighter pilots also require strong muscle tissue along the extremities and abdomen, for performing an anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM, see below) when performing tight turns and other highly accelerated maneuvers. Better-than-average visual acuity is also a highly desirable and valuable trait.  Tactics  =Offensive= Modern medium and long range active radar homing and semi- active radar homing missiles can be fired at targets outside or beyond visual range. However, when a pilot is dogfighting at short-range, his position relative to the opponent is decidedly important. Outperformance of another pilot and that pilot's aircraft is critical to maintain the upper-hand. A common saying for dogfighting is \\"lose sight, lose fight\\". If one pilot had a greater missile range than the other, he would choose to fire his missile first, before being in range of the enemy's missile. Normally, the facts of an enemy's weapon payload is unknown, and are revealed as the fight progresses. Some air combat maneuvers form the basis for the sport of aerobatics: *Basic **Split S **Immelmann turn **Thach Weave **The Scissors **Chandelle *Complex **Pugachev's Cobra **Herbst maneuver = Defensive = Pilots are trained to employ specific tactics and maneuvers when they are under attack. Attacks from missiles are usually countered with electronic countermeasures, Flares and chaff. Missiles like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, however, can actively home in on jamming signals. Dogfighting at is considered \\"close\\". Pilots perform stressful maneuvers to gain advantage in the dogfight. Pilots need to be in good shape in order to handle the high G-forces caused by aerial combat. A pilot flexes his legs and torso to keep blood from draining out of the head. This is known as the AGSM or the M1 or, sometimes, as the \\"grunt\\". = Defense against missiles = Many early air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles had very simple infrared homing (\\"heat seeking\\") guidance systems with a narrow field of view. These missiles could be avoided by simply turning sharply, which essentially caused the missile to lose sight of the target aircraft. Another tactic was to exploit a missile's limited range by performing evasive maneuvers until the missiles had run out of fuel. Modern infrared missiles, like the AIM-9 Sidewinder, have a more advanced guidance system. Supercooled infrared detectors help the missile find a possible exhaust source, and software assists the missile in flying towards its target. Pilots normally drop flares to confuse or decoy these missiles by creating more multiple heat signatures hotter than that of the aircraft for the missile to lock onto and guide away from the defending aircraft. Radar homing missiles could sometimes be confused by surface objects or geographical features causing clutter for the guidance system of either the missile or ground station guiding it. Chaff is another option in the case that the aircraft is too high up to use geographical obstructions. Pilots have to be aware of the potential threats and learn to distinguish between the two where possible. They use the RWR (radar warning receiver) to discern the types of signals hitting their aircraft. = G-force = When maneuvering fiercely during engagements, pilots are subjected to high G-force. G-forces express the magnitude of gravity, with 1G being equivalent to Earth's normal pull of gravity. Because modern jet aircraft are highly agile and have the capacity to make very sharp turns, the pilot's body is often pushed to the limit. When executing a \\"positive G\\" maneuver like turning upwards the force pushes the pilot down. The most serious consequence of this is that the blood in the pilot's body is also pulled down and into their extremities. If the forces are great enough and over a sufficient period of time this can lead to blackouts (called G-induced loss of consciousness or G-LOC), because not enough blood is reaching the pilot's brain. To counteract this effect pilots are trained to tense their legs and abdominal muscles to restrict the \\"downward\\" flow of blood. This is known as the \\"grunt\\" or the \\"Hick maneuver\\". Both names allude to the sounds the pilot makes, and is the primary method of resisting G-LOCs. Modern flight suits, called G-suits, are worn by pilots to contract around the extremities exerting pressure, providing about 1G of extra tolerance.

It is located on Fenham Hall Drive in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. General Information The school educates around 1,400 girls between the ages of eleven and eighteen on the site which has had a near £10 million makeover. The school consists of the main building, a technology and art building, a P.E. block, a maths and modern foreign languages building, a geography building, the sixth form centre, a small pottery and a dance studio. The uniform is currently (2015) a navy blue blazer and jumper, and a Douglas Tartan kilt or trousers(dark blue, light blue, green and white). History A private college was founded in Fenham Hall in 1903 becoming a Government-recognised boarding and day school in 1905, taking ex-pupil-teachers, scholarship and fee-paying pupils. The college initially opened with 60 pupils and was under the sponsorship of the Society of the Sacred Heart nuns. It went through a number of changes until 1926 when it obtained Direct Grant status and became a grammar school. The grammar school lasted until 1977 when it became the Sacred Heart Comprehensive School, taking girls from 11 – 18 years old. In 1998 it was renamed the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic High School. In 2007 the school signed up to the Building Schools for the Future initiative.

An assembled portaledge is a fabric-covered platform surrounded by a metal frame that hangs from a single point and has adjustable suspension straps. A separate cover, called a stormfly, covers the entire system in the event of bad weather.  History  Hammocks were used by climbers before portaledges were developed. Lying on the 1986-2016 portaledge design The 2017 D4 Portaledge re-invention supersedes the prior state of the art as published in the 1996 \\"Simply Stormproof\\" sketch. D4 Delta2p, the 2020 Middendorf design = 1950–1960 = Warren Harding slept on natural ledges during his first ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite in 1958. = 1960–70 = The multiple day routes on El Capitan pushed climbers to invent structures for sleeping. They began securing traditional two point hammocks to cliff walls. Warren Harding invented the first hammock suspended from a central point, which he called a B.A.T. (Basically Absurd Technology) Tent. Central suspension facilitates deployment, prevents the tipping that occurs with two point hammocks, and has since been integrated into every significant big wall sleeping structure. Harding almost died during his 1968 attempt on Half Dome in Yosemite after being trapped in a three-day storm, where his B.A.T Tent filled with freezing rain and snow. Single point hammocks allowed little sleep because they offered no weather resistance and crushed climber's shoulders. = 1970–1980 = During the early 1970s, climbers Billy Westbay and Bruce Hawkins created the first portaledges by re-appropriating steel and canvas cots stolen from park lodges in Yosemite. These were a vast improvement from single point hammocks with regard to comfort, but they were not collapsible and weighed up to thirty kilograms (almost three times the weight of today's models). During this period climbers also used Submarine Ledges, made from U.S. Navy aluminum tube cots that had been purchased from army surplus stores. In 1972 the climber brothers Gregg and Jeff Lowe designed the LURP, a highly innovative portaledge prototype. The design's collapsible frame allowed the Lowes to climb without the bulk of a cot. Every significant portaledge since the LURP has had a collapsible frame. Another pioneering feature of this design was its nylon fly tent, which provided an enclosed shelter from the elements. Fly tents quickly became a standard element of portaledges. Jeff Lowe used the LURP on the first winter ascent of Yosemite's Half Dome. Although the prototype was never sold to others, the brothers included it in their catalogue of climbing products, which circulated widely among climbers. By the late 1970s the term \\"portaledge\\", which combines the words \\"portable\\" and \\"ledge\\", had become the common name for the typology. The originator of the term remains unknown to this day. Mike Graham, a famous American climber, founded his climbing gear company Gramicci in 1977. Over the next five years Graham sold over five hundred of the first commercially available portaledges, called Cliff Dwellings, to climbers in California and Europe. Graham made his Cliff Dwellings using equipment that he carried in his truck, and would set up his shop in friend's garages and basements. Graham's frame tubes slotted into each other at their corners, which allowed the frame to collapse into the smallest bag possible. His minimal corner connections were an important innovation, but they also made the Cliff Dwelling vulnerable to structural failure under extreme forces of nature. For an expedition to Patagonia in 1979 Graham designed the Fortress, the first portaledge large enough for two people. This model was constructed with ballistic nylon, a fabric strong enough to deflect small pieces of falling ice and rock. During the same year Graham made, but never tested, a prototype of a Windshield: a tent, suspended below the Cliff Dwelling that would deflect upward winds away from the portaledge. = 1980–1986 = The first portaledges used in Yosemite were non-collapsible cots purloined from Housekeeping Camp, a Yosemite Valley campground that featured primitive metal framed bunks for the campers. These heavy cots were used on multi-day climbs on granite monoliths like El Capitan, and then sometimes tossed off the summit for later retrieval. Mike Graham is credited with the first collapsible portaledge models available for retail purchase under the name of his company, Gramicci Products based in Ventura, California. The Gramicci Portaledge appeared in the very early 1980s and revolutionized multiday big wall comfort. There were a few minor manufacturers that also dabbled in portaledge design in the early 1980s but could not get any traction in this niche market and soon faded from sight. In late 1984 a small California based company called Fish Products started to manufacture one person single portaledges, designed by Russ Walling, the company founder. Fish Products is still manufacturing these portaledges some 25 years later. Other early Portaledge manufacturers were Fig, Lowe (never commercially available), and C&S; Engineering. = 1986–1998 = In 1986, John Middendorf, a Stanford- trained mechanical engineer, founded A5 Adventures. Previously, Middendorf and his companions Steve Bosque and Mike Corbett had nearly died due to portaledge failure during a three-day storm on the 2000 foot South Face of Half Dome, prompting Middendorf to redesign the modern portaledge. A5 portaledges were constructed of highly weatherproof fabrics and engineered to be structurally stable and strong. The company produced three models: the Single, the Alpine Double, and the Cliff Cabana. The A5 portaledges were the first that could withstand the severe weather conditions in remote areas such as the Himalayas and the Karakoram, enabling climbers to expand their horizons to the largest rock faces in the world. Middendorf himself used A5 portaledges on some of the hardest and remote big walls of the world, including during the first ascent of The Grand Voyage on the Great Trango Tower in 1992, the longest vertical big wall (1350m) in the world. The A5 Portaledge was sold worldwide. = 1998–2016 = The North Face (TNF) acquired the assets of A5 Adventures, including the A5 portaledge design, in 1998. Middendorf continued to steer the product for an additional two years at TNF before moving on to other pursuits outside of the climbing industry. The A5 portaledge designs were subsequently transferred to Black Diamond Equipment of Salt Lake City, Utah, who continue to produce the A5 designs with many added features. As of 2016, there were four major commercial suppliers of portaledges, making the following popular models: *Black Diamond Single (81\\" x 31.5\\", 21.7 pounds with fly, modified clone of the A5 Single). *Black Diamond Double (84\\" x 51\\", 28.4 pounds with fly and spreader bar, modified clone of the A5 Cliff Cabana). *Runout Customs Double (75\\" x 42.25\\", 15 pounds with fly and haulsack, clone of the A5 Alpine Double). *Metolius Single (84\\" x 30\\", 18.5 pounds with fly, haulsack, similar to the A5 block corner design.). *Metolius Double (84\\" x 45\\", 21.5 pounds with fly, haulsack and spreader bar, similar to A5 design). *Fish Single/Double (77\\" x 42\\", 13/16 pounds with fly; rigid corner ledge design, steel frame). = 2017 = In 2017, John Middendorf introduced a new portaledge design, called the D4 Portaledge (82\\" x 47\\", 16.5 pounds with haulsack, fly, and flypole). Instead of block corners, which has been the de facto standard since they were first introduced, the new D4 Portaledge has rounded curved tubing corners, which offer more rigidity and are lighter than the traditional block corners. The D4 portaledge brings many more innovations, including a newly engineered hybrid diameter tube design, which provides strength and rigidity without the need for a spreader bar, a new integrated haulsack/deployment system, and a completely simple but new concept for the stormfly--a single vertical zipped opening which enables the quickest deployment while also allowing full opening between storms. Also around this time, Middendorf introduces the D4 \\"bullet-joiner\\" which is a simple yet effective way to create a joint with overlapping tube strength, and rounded nose for quick self-assembling joints. The D4 has been produced in several sizes and besides being lighter and stronger, pack smaller (29” x 10” for the full size D4) than previous designs of portaledges. = 2020 = Middendorf continues new portaledge innovations with the \\"Delta2P\\" portaledge, the first \\"back to the wall, foot-out\\" design, based on years of tinkering in his shop. Named for its delta shape and 2-person design, this design solves many longstanding issues with portaledges, including improved ergonomics and thanks to its rigid six- piece frame design, using the D4 curved corners and bullet-joiner design innovations. Photos and full design notes available online.  Other uses  Portaledges have been used by tree-sitters during anti-logging civil disobedience protests , enabling them to remain aloft in trees for weeks, months, or sometimes years. They are also used in recreational tree camping.

The World Passport is similar in appearance to a genuine national passport or other such authentic travel document. In 1979 the World Passport was a 42-page document, with a dark blue cover, and text in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, and Esperanto. It contained a five-page section for medical history and a six-page section for listing organisational affiliation. The fee charged at that time was US$32 plus postage for a three-year World Passport that could be renewed for a further two years.'World' passport termed advisable, an article by John Brannon Albright in the Bangor Daily News, (26 October 1979) The version of the World Passport current was produced in January 2007. It has an embedded \\"ghost\\" photo for security, covered with a plastic film. Its data page is in the format of a machine-readable passport, with an alphanumeric code bar in the machine-readable zone (MRZ) enabling it to be scanned by an optical reader. However, in place of a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code in the MRZ \\"issuer\\" and \\"nationality\\" fields, it uses the non-standard code \\"WSA\\". According to the WSA website, the fee is $55 for a three-year World Passport, $75 for five years, and $100 for ten years. A \\"World Donor Passport\\" valid for fifteen years with a special cover is issued gratis to donors of at least $400 which, according to the WSA, is used to provide free documents to refugees and stateless persons. In addition, the customer can choose between two World Passport covers: \\"World Passport\\" or \\"World Government Passport\\". The WSA recommends their customers to purchase the second option. A potential customer must provide as proof of identity a notarized certification of the details on the form, a copy of their national identity papers, or a fingerprint from their right index finger.

As a travel document  The appearance is so similar to a genuine passport that in 1974 a criminal case was lodged against Garry Davis in France regarding his sale of World Passports.World Citizen, by Mark Blackburn, The Leader-Post, Regina, 31 May 1974, p30 According to the WSA, the version of the document introduced in 2007 was filed as a Machine Readable Travel Document (MRTD) with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, ICAO documents on MRTDs cite the World Service Authority and its World Passport as an example of \\"Fantasy Documents\\". = Notable acceptances = Success in crossing a border using a World Passport is generally attributable to the whim or ignorance of individual immigration officers, not official recognition of the document. The World Service Authority website has scans of letters dating from many decades ago from six countries (Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Mauritania, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia) which the WSA claims is legal recognition of the World Passports. These letters of recognition are several decades old (i.e., 1954 for Ecuador, 1972 for Burkina Faso, 1975 for Mauritania, 1995 for Tanzania, 1983 for Togo, 1973 for Zambia) and reasonable doubt exists about today's acceptance. According to the World Service Authority website, some World Passports have reportedly been accepted on a case-by-case basis by over 180 countries (i.e., they have been stamped with a national visa or entry or exit stamp), and according to the World Service Authority some countries in the past accorded the document legal recognition. The World Passport came under increased international scrutiny in 1996, after the hijacking of the MS Achille Lauro. In the aftermath of the incident, one of the captured hijackers, Youssef Majed al-Molqi, escaped imprisonment in Italy and used a World Passport which he had purchased in 1988 to leave the country and travel to Spain before he was recaptured.Achille Lauro killer likely fled to Algeria: Furloughed terrorist used documents from U.S. to escape, Peggy Polk, The Washington Times (22 March 1996)Private 'authority' issues passports: Escaped terrorist among recipients, Paige Bowers, The Washington Times (22 March 1996) = Notable rejections = Many countries and territories say they do not recognize the World Passport because it is not issued by a competent government authority, and thus does not meet the definition of a passport. By 1975, Garry Davis had already been detained twenty times for his attempts to cross international borders with a World Passport.Oddities in the news, article in The Calgary Herald (5 May 1975)  Commonwealth of Independent States  The Russian government states that it does not recognise the World Passport. In a 1995 interview with Kommersant, a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Consular Services stated that the World Passport is not an acceptable document for proving identity or citizenship status at Russian border crossings; only a diplomatic passport, official passport, seaman's passport, or general civil passport are accepted.Лучший Способ Потерять Деньги , an article by Svetlana Branitskaya (18 June 1995) in Kommersant However, one Russian media report claims that some members of the House of Romanov, travelling to Saint Petersburg for the reburial of the remains of one of their ancestors, were permitted by Russian authorities to obtain visas in their World Passports, in light of the special situation.Паспорт, который только в Африке паспорт , an article by Valeriya Mozganova on Travel.ru (22 January 1997) In December 2008, a man claiming to be a Russian citizen attempted to cross the border from Latvia into Belarus at the Urbany checkpoint using a World Passport; he stated he lost his Russian documents while in Sweden. He was arrested by the Belarusian border guards. A spokesman for Belarus' State Border Committee in an interview with a local newspaper stated that Belarus does not accept the World Passport at border crossings. He also claimed it was the first known case of its kind in the country.Белорусские пограничники задержали гражданина мира , an article from Lenta.ru (23 December 2008)Полоцкие пограничники поймали гражданина мира , an article from Naviny.by (23 December 2008)  United States  The United States Department of State's official position on the World Passport is that it is a booklet produced by a private organisation upon payment of a fee, and not a passport. As early as 1991, the US Air Transport Association specifically included the World Passport in a training film as an example of unacceptable travel papers. In 2012, a Belizean man attempted to enter the U.S. through the Veterans International Bridge at Los Tomates using a World Passport. The man in question had prior felony convictions for drug trafficking and immigration offences, and had previously been deported from the United States multiple times. He claimed that he wanted to speak with President Obama about genocide in Belize. In a bench trial, Judge Andrew S. Hanen found the man guilty of felony attempted re-entry after deportation.'World Passport' didn't work on bridge, an article from The Brownsville Herald (February 21, 2012)  Other countries  Peace activist Kenneth O'Keefe tried to travel to Iraq using a World Passport in 2003, but was rejected transit rights by Turkey, and had to apply for an American passport to continue his journey.Electing to leave: A reader's guide to expatriating on November 3 , article by Bryant Urstadt in Harper's Magazine (October 2004)Ken O'Keefe - On Being a World Citizen , article by Tim King in Salem News (10 May 2011) In 2004, two men from China on board Cathay Pacific Flight 302 from Hong Kong to Guangzhou attempted to pass through immigration at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport using World Passports. The officers at the airport arrested them for illegal entry. Also, though Garry Davis claims to have traveled to India using a World Passport and to have given one personally to Jawaharlal Nehru,'World Passport' Given to Nehru by Garry Davis , a Chicago Daily Tribune article (9 June 1956)Excludable alien with world passport , a Times of India article (10 December 2002) in May 2007 an Indian citizen was arrested for attempting to leave India at Begumpet Airport using a World Passport. The man, intending to travel to the United States, had purchased what he believed was a genuine passport and visa. His travel agency and Air India staff both accepted his World Passport, but Indian immigration did not. The Times of India called it a clear case of \\"internet fraud\\" and stated that the man had been \\"duped\\".'World passport' to nowhere , The Times of India article (24 May 2007) The Council of the European Union has a table of travel documents entitling the holder to cross external borders of Schengen states and which may be endorsed with a visa; the World Passport is listed as a fantasy passport to which a visa may not be affixed. In February 2013, both Panama and Costa Rica rejected the use of the World Passport by Sage Million, a fugitive from Hawaii.American Fugitive Expat Sage Million Hiding in Volcan , Panama Guide article (4 April 2013) Hip-hop artist and actor Yasiin Bey (Mos Def) was arrested in South Africa on January 15, 2016 for attempting to leave the country using a World Passport. He had entered the country using an American passport and had lived in Cape Town since May 2013. South Africa's Department of Home Affairs released a statement saying that Mr. Bey would be allowed to appeal the immigration action and possibly seek permanent residency. = Use by refugees and stateless persons = The World Service Authority sells World Passports to refugees and other people who are unable to obtain valid, authentic travel documents. According to the WSA, refugees in camps are given free World Passports. WSA reports that it \\"has [given out] more than 10,000 free World Passports to refugees residing in camps throughout the world\\" and that it \\"has documentary evidence that the issuance of such passports may permit refugees to leave such camps to seek asylum elsewhere or to claim other rights often denied to refugees\\". However, many of those refugees have found World Passports to be useless.Documents for Refugees Criticized as Passports to Heartbreak, article by Karlyn Barker in The Washington Post (10 December 1991) According to statements by Garry Davis in the mid-1970s, major users of World Passports at the time included persons in Southeast Asia fleeing from wars, as well as holders of Rhodesian passports who were otherwise unable to travel internationally as no other country accepted their documents besides South Africa.U.S. Native advocates borderless world, an article in The Southeast Missourian (27 August 1975) Many East African refugees arriving in Nordic countries in the early 1990s had World Passports.'People Smugglers' Send New Tide of Refugees Onto Nordic Shores , article by Henry Kamm in The New York Times (15 February 1993) In July 2011, a Georgian citizen attempted to pass through Latvian border control with a World Passport, though he also had a valid Georgian passport in his possession; after presenting his World Passport, he requested asylum in Latvia.Georgian citizen presents World Passport to Latvian border guards , an article by Alla Petrova in The Baltic Course, 27 July 2011 Another category of users of World Passports are stowaways on ships. Vessel owners are legally responsible for the stowaways until they can find a country to let them ashore, but countries are often reluctant due to questions over the validity of the stowaways' documents. From 1992 to 2006 the WSA sold their document to such individuals on five occasions.Stowaway: A man with no country. From port to port, he is trapped on a ship. , article by Gaiutra Bahadur in The Philadelphia Inquirer (30 January 2006) As an identity document The World Service Authority promotes the World Passport not just as a document for international travel, but a \\"neutral, apolitical document of identity\\". Investor Doug Casey, himself a World Passport customer, has suggested that a World Passport is useful at hotels and other non-governmental institutions where security is uncertain; if one is asked to hand over one's real passport in such situations, one can provide the World Passport instead of a genuine national passport. Governmental authorities do not share this assessment. The Criminal Records Bureau of the United Kingdom Home Office states that registered bodies should not accept the World Passport as a proof of identity, warning that \\"a fake 'World Passport' can be purchased online by members of the public and should not be confused with a genuine passport\\". The Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission, which regulates the isle's banks and company formation agents, states that the World Passport is not an acceptable document to prove either the nationality or identity of the bearer. Specifically, it classifies it as a spurious or fantasy passport, a term which it defines to mean as documents which \\"have the appearance of a passport, but are issued by organisations with no authority and to which no official recognition has been given\\". The United States Social Security Administration will also not accept any World Service Authority document (including the World Passport and World Donor Passport) as evidence of identity, age, citizenship, alien status, or marital status for either claims or enumeration purposes. The Virginia Department of Social Services explicitly classifies all World Service Authority documents as \\"unacceptable documents\\" for verification of identity.Virginia Department of Social Services; Auxiliary Grant Program, NOn Financial REquirements, Volume II, Part III, Chapter C , page 6 The United States Department of State instructs all U.S. embassies and consulates not to provide any notarial, apostille, or other authentication services in respect of World Passports, whether regarding the World Passport itself or documents relating to the purchase of a World Passport. They warn that such documents could be used for fraudulent or criminal purposes.7 FAM 890 UNUSUAL NOTARIAL REQUESTS .

He was convicted of fraud on a financial institution. As a political statement Regardless of its almost universal lack of acceptance, an individual may also seek to obtain a World Passport as part of a political statement. A number of Russian citizens have obtained the World Passport as a form of protest against the \\"red tape\\" imposed by the Russian government on their own citizens aiming to travel abroad.Зачем россияне становятся Гражданами Мира? , an article in Abakan Gazeta (17 September 2009) In 1977, two mayors of West Bank towns bought World Passports during a visit by Garry Davis.World Citizen Makes Offer To Arabs, an article in the Observer-Reporter (January 22, 1977) Sale by third parties Old version of World Passport Despite its limited acceptance, other entities have also sought to manufacture and sell the fantasy travel document, without the consent of the WSA. The Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission reports that they have identified counterfeit World Passports. Also, the first cross-jurisdictional fake passport case ever found in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China involved counterfeit World Passports. In February 1981, the local Public Security Bureau identified some Hong Kong criminals who were charging World Passport customers HK$18,000 plus CN¥50-100 (roughly US$3,300 at the official exchange rate at that time) in processing fees, and misrepresenting to them that World Passport customers could settle in any country in the world.警界纵横 , on the website of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, gzjd.gov.cn As mentioned above, Russia does not accept World Passports, but in the 1990s, many company formation agents in Russia sold the World Passport together in a package-deal with the setup of an offshore company (international business company), and falsely claimed that all countries of the world accept it as an identity document. In some cases, such companies charged up to US$1,000 for the document alone.Осторожно: стантия лоховская.

It is located on near Hendersonville, North Carolina, with scenic Kanuga Lake at its center. Yearly, more than 35,000 guests utilize the facilities, which include the Conference Center, Camp Kanuga (for Boys and Girls), Camp Bob, and the Mountain Trail Outdoor School. The word Kanuga is of Cherokee origin referring to both a former place of a Cherokee settlement in South Carolina and to a Cherokee tool resembling a short comb with seven teeth used in preparation of players in a Cherokee ritual stick ball game. The description 'gathering place' also came to be associated with the term, which led to its selection as the name of a new vacation colony in 1909. History =Kanuga Lake Club= Kanuga began in 1909 as \\"Kanuga Lake Club,\\" the dream of George Stephens, a Charlotte banker, real estate developer, and newspaper publisher. Kanuga Lake Club was designed to be a place for families from the \\"low country\\" of South Carolina and North Carolina to take vacation. Stephens employed John Nolen as his planner, and Richard Sharp Smith as his architect. After were purchased, a dam was built over Mud Creek, creating a lake (much larger than the current Lake Kanuga). Thirty-nine cottages, an inn with dining rooms, and a lakeside pavilion were built, usable only during the summer months. Utilizing his successful businesses, American Trust Company (now Bank of America and his newspapers, the Charlotte Observer, and the Asheville Citizen, Stephens attracted people to Kanuga. In 1916, tragedy struck. After heavy rains, the dam to Lake Kanuga broke, sending water through Hendersonville and Asheville. Modern innovations such as the automobile also made single destination vacation sites increasingly obsolete. Subsequently, Kanuga went broke and was closed. A new dam that shortened the lake to its present size would eventually be built, but over the following 12 years four attempts at reorganizing the facility ended with four bankruptcies. =Kanuga, an Episcopal Center= In 1928 Bishop Kirkman George Finlay of the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina spearheaded the effort to purchase the land and open a camp and conference center for the North Carolina and South Carolina Episcopal dioceses. Money was raised for the operation, and with the support and backing of the neighboring Episcopal dioceses, the property was purchased and in that summer six weeks of youth and clergy conferences were followed by six weeks of guest period. Church services were held in outdoor chapels or inside the lounge of the inn until 1940, when the Chapel of the Transfiguration was dedicated in the memory of Bishop Finlay who had died two years earlier. Scottish architect S. Grant Alexander was commissioned to design and build the Chapel out of yellow pine wood harvested on the property. The soft wood was not as strong a wood as Alexander had hoped, so support beams were added to prevent the walls from collapsing. By the 1960s, age and decay were catching up with the original buildings and the inn was torn down and replaced in 1968 by a modern inn and dining area which allowed Kanuga to operate year-round. The original 39 cottages were kept and eventually winterized in the 1990s while retaining their original appearance. Nearly all of the original cottages and the outdoor Chapel of St. Francis are on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Kanuga Lake Historic District. The district encompasses 40 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site. From its earliest days Kanuga has also operated separate overnight summer camps for boys and girls. In 1931, a summer camp facility for boys was built near the inn. A new boys camp facility was built on another part of the property in 1962, allowing the first facility to be used as a girls' camp. In the 1970s the boys' and girls' camps were combined on the second campus, and the first campus was first rented to the National Wildlife Federation and eventually redesigned as the Bob Campbell Youth Campus for underprivileged children in the summer and as an outdoor education facility throughout the rest of the year. Camp Kanuga currently has 9-day and 13-day sessions for boys and girls ages 7–15. The Trailblazers program is offered to ages 15–17 which includes off-campus rafting and an 8-day hiking adventure on the Appalachian Trail. Kanuga has continued to grow, adding many buildings for meetings and recreation to the campus facility. Conferences held during the year are sponsored by Kanuga and outside groups, and churches from many denominations within a few hours drive will use the campus for Parish weekends in the non-summer months. The House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church have used Kanuga as a multi-day meeting site as have the Primates of the Anglican Communion. The seven weeks of Summer Guest Period in July and August attract visitors to capacity each year, including multi- generational families attending since Kanuga's beginning. Guest periods in the Fall, Thanksgiving weekend and at Christmas have also proved to be popular.

It was one of the UK's larger shipowning and operating companies, and as such had a significant role in the country's overseas trade and in the First and Second World Wars. Its seafarers later went to fill various roles in the British maritime shore based establishment, including Malcolm Machlachlan, a lecturer in Glasgow and a popular author of books on Maritime business. History = Foundation and expansion = Alfred Holt founded the business on 16 January 1866. The main operating subsidiary was the Ocean Steam Ship Company, which owned and operated the majority of the company's vessels. A Dutch subsidiary, the Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschappij Oceaan, was founded in 1891, as was the East India Ocean Steam Ship Company, operated from Singapore. This latter was sold in 1899 to Norddeutscher Lloyd. The company acquired the competing China Mutual Steam Navigation Company in 1902, keeping it as a subsidiary company but operating it as part of Blue Funnel Line. Ships of the Blue Funnel fleet all had names from classical Greek legend or history. The majority were cargo ships, but most of the Ocean SS Co cargo ships also had capacity for a few passengers. The line also had a small number of purely passenger vessels. passenger liner . sank her in 1942 but all 290 people aboard survived. , launched 7 December 1912, and , launched 5 July 1913, are examples of large cargo/passenger vessels entering the line's service at the time. Both ships were built in Belfast by Workman, Clark and Company with a length of and 14,500 gross tons. Passenger accommodations were for first class only and seven cargo holds, one and a 'tween decks space fitted for refrigerated meat, dairy and fruit cargoes, provided accommodation of the largest consignments. Painting of the approaching Hong Kong. sank her in 1942 with the loss of 87 lives. The painting is in the Museum of Liverpool; the artist is unknown. In the 1920s, Blue Funnel became the first British shipping company to employ a woman marine engineer. Victoria Drummond served with the company three times: firstly as Tenth Engineer on the liner 1922–24, then as refrigeration engineer on the refrigerated cargo ship in 1943 and finally as resident engineer at Caledon Shipbuilding in Dundee supervising the completion of and in 1946. These were two of the first new ships built for Blue Funnel to replace its Second World War losses. The company expanded in 1937 through acquisition of the Glen Line in 1935, that provided cargo and passenger service to the Far East from eastern English ports such as London. The overall managing director, C. E. Wurtzburg, brought Herbert Gladstone McDavid to London from the company's Liverpool office as director of the new acquisition and profits increased. Eight new Glenearn class ships were ordered, four from UK shipyards and four from abroad but not all were delivered when the Second World War started. = Outward Bound = The first Outward Bound school was opened in Aberdyfi, Wales in 1941 with the support of the Blue Funnel Line.Outward Bound International (2004). Birth of Outward Bound . Retrieved 9 December 2007. Outward Bound's founding mission was to improve the survival chances of young seamen after their ships were torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic. Capt. J. F. 'Freddy' Fuller of the Blue Funnel Line took over the leadership of the Aberdyfi school in 1942 and served the Outward Bound movement as senior warden until 1971.James, David, (1957) \\"Outward Bound\\" Routledge and Kegan Paul, London. Fuller was seconded following wartime experience during the Battle of the Atlantic of surviving two successive torpedo attacks and commanding an open lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for thirty-five days without losing a single member of the crew. =Post World Wars= Blue Funnel lost 16 ships in the First World War and 30 in the Second. After each war it restored its fleet with new ships. After the Second War it regained tonnage rapidly by buying six Victory ships from the United States Maritime Commission in 1946 and eight \\"Sam-\\" ships from the Ministry of War Transport in 1947. Six of the eight new ships ordered by Glen Line in 1938 were reacquired, resulting in a fleet of 15 ships by September 1948. The twice-monthly fast service and a slower secondary service to the Far East resumed. Two Blue Funnel ships, MS Agapenor and MS Melampus were trapped by the Six-Day War of 1967 and became part of the Yellow Fleet in the Great Bitter Lake, remaining there until 1975. =Decline= From 1947 to 1970, as Britain's empire began to shrink, so did its trade. Simultaneously, companies from other parts of the world began to operate more competitively. Cabotage regulations prevented British flag companies from trading on routes that were previously their monopolies. Several factors resulted in a decreased number in the Blue Funnel's fleet. The company finally came to an end in 1988 when Ocean Group withdrew from the Barber Blue Sea Service, its last shipping line.

Postmodernists believe that many situations which are considered political in nature can not be adequately discussed in traditional realist and liberal approaches to political science. Postmodernists cite examples such as the situation of a Benedictine University “draft-age youth whose identity is claimed in national narratives of ‘national security’ and the universalizing narratives of the ‘rights of man,’” of “the woman whose very womb is claimed by the irresolvable contesting narratives of ‘church,’ ‘paternity,’ ‘economy,’ and ‘liberal polity.’Richard K. Ashley and R. B. J. Walker, \\"Introduction: Speaking the Language of Exile: Dissident Thought in International Studies\\" in International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1990), pp. 259-268 In these cases, postmodernists argue that there are no fixed categories, stable sets of values, or common sense meanings to be understood in their scholarly exploration. In these margins, postmodernists believe that people resist realist concepts of power which is repressive, in order to maintain a claim on their own identity. What makes this resistance significant is that among the aspects of power resisted is that which forces individuals to take a single identity or to be subject to a particular interpretation. Meaning and interpretation in these types of situations is always uncertain; arbitrary in fact. The power in effect here is not that of oppression, but that of the cultural and social implications around them, which creates the framework within which they see themselves, which creates the boundaries of their possible courses of action. Postmodern political scientists, such as Richard Ashley, claim that in these marginal sites it is impossible to construct a coherent narrative, or story, about what is really taking place without including contesting and contradicting narratives, and still have a “true” story from the perspective of a “sovereign subject,” who can dictate the values pertinent to the “meaning” of the situation. In fact, it is possible here to deconstruct the idea of meaning. Ashley attempts to reveal the ambiguity of texts, especially Western texts, how the texts themselves can be seen as \\"sites of conflict\\" within a given culture or worldview. By regarding them in this way, deconstructive readings attempt to uncover evidence of ancient cultural biases, conflicts, lies, tyrannies, and power structures, such as the tensions and ambiguity between peace and war, lord and subject, male and female, which serve as further examples of Derrida's binary oppositions in which the first element is privileged, or considered prior to and more authentic, in relation to the second. Examples of postmodern political scientists include post-colonial writers such as Frantz Fanon, feminist writers such as Cynthia Enloe, and postpositive theorists such as Ashley and James Der Derian.

He headed the Sarmi fashion design house in New York City. Early years Sarmi was born into a wealthy Italian family and raised in Trieste. He expressed interest in fashion as a youth but was discouraged from pursuing a design career by his father. Sarmi stated in a 1965 interview with Time, \\"in Italy, when the oldest son tells his father he wants to be a dress designer, it's like a woman saying she intends to be a prostitute\\". His father sent him to study at the University of Siena, where he received a doctor of law degree. Despite his professional training, he desired a career in fashion. He became a costume designer and created costumes for two Italian films: Musica Proibita (released as Forbidden Music in the US) in 1942 and Cronaca di un Amore (released as Story of a Love Affair in the US) in 1950. It was his first and only known on-screen performance. He left Italy in 1951 to work in New York fashion. New York From 1951–1959, Sarmi was head designer for Elizabeth Arden. He then opened his own high quality ready-to-wear salon in New York in 1959, using the label Sarmi. In 1960, he won a Coty Award. It was during this time that he developed a reputation as a top designer, wooing an influential clientele that included celebrities, New York socialites, and foreign dignitaries. Pat Nixon wore a Sarmi for Arden gown to her husband's second Inaugural Ball in 1957. He was best known for his opulent evening looks, and for his use of extravagant fabrics such as swansdown. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 12 January 1959. Sarmi left Arden and opened his own Seventh Avenue boutique in 1959. In 1960, he was awarded the prestigious Coty Award for fashion design. His collection included haute couture and ready-to-wear apparel that set the pace for 1960s fashion in New York. His designs commonly featured intricate embroideries, vivid colors, and racy hemlines as well as hand-silkscreened silks and the first-ever tie-dyed silk chiffons used in haute couture, designed and produced by Tzaims Luksus. During the late 1960s, the house fell upon financial difficulties. In 1972, his business was renamed Ferdinando Sarmi, but it closed shortly thereafter.

Though the public face of the agency is generally associated with the construction and maintenance of the state's immense state highway system, the agency is also responsible for overseeing aviation, rail, and public transportation systems in the state. At one time, TxDOT also administered vehicle registration; but this function transferred to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, a state agency which began operations in November 2009. The agency has been headquartered in the Dewitt C. Greer Building at 125 East 11th Street in Downtown Austin, Texas, since 1933. History The Texas Legislature created the Texas Highway Department in 1916 to administer federal highway construction and maintenance. In 1975, its responsibilities increased when the agency merged with the Texas Mass Transportation Commission, to form the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation.Texas Highway Department: An Inventory of Highway Department Records at the Texas State Archives, 1920s–1930s, 1962–1975. http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tslac/20021/tsl-20021.html In 1986, the department started using \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" as its slogan to reduce littering on Texas roadways, as part of a statewide advertising campaign. The phrase was prominently shown on road signs on major highways, as well as in television, radio, and print advertisements. The slogan is still in use and remains very popular. In 1991, the Legislature combined the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, the Department of Aviation, and the Texas Motor Vehicle Commission to create the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). In 1997, the pre-existing Texas Turnpike Authority (TTA) was divided into two successor agencies: the North Texas Tollway Authority took responsibility for TTA assets in four North Texas counties, while the Turnpike Authority Division of Texas DOT was given jurisdiction over toll facilities in the rest of the state. In 2009, the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles was created by the state legislature, taking over some functions from TxDOT. Administration With approximately 12,000 employees, The executive director is currently James Bass. Previously Bass served as chief financial officer since 2005. He is assisted by one deputy director and four assistant executive directors. The current interim Deputy Executive Director is Marc Williams. The department is organized into 25 geographical districts and 34 divisions. =Districts= TxDOT districts map TxDOT is one of the state's largest departments in terms of the number of subordinate offices – it maintains 25 geographical districts throughout the state. The large number of departments is needed due to the large size of the state, the widely varying climate and soil conditions affecting public roads, and the differing needs of the local populace (urban vs. suburban vs. rural). In 2010, TxDOT was reorganized into four regions, North, South, East, and West. The regions are designated as Regional Support Centers. The number of districts remained the same. Each district, managed by a district engineer, is responsible for the design, location, construction, and maintenance of its area transportation systems. Local field offices within districts are known as area offices, and many districts also have separate maintenance offices, usually on a county-by-county basis. Functional divisions and offices headquartered in Austin provide administrative and technical support to the districts. {style=\\"width:90%;\\" * Abilene * Amarillo * Atlanta * Austin * Beaumont * Brownwood * Bryan * Childress * Corpus Christi * Dallas * El Paso * Fort Worth * Houston * Laredo * Lubbock * Lufkin * Odessa * Paris * Pharr * San Angelo * San Antonio * Tyler * Waco * Wichita Falls * Yoakum |} =Divisions= {style=\\"width:90%;\\" * Aviation * Bridge * Civil Rights * Communications * Compliance * Construction * Contracts and Purchasing * Design * Environmental Affairs * Financial Management * Fleet Operations * General Counsel * General Services * Government Affairs * Human Resources * Information Technology * Internal Audit * Maintenance * Maritime * Occupational Safety * Professional Engineering Procurement Services * Project Finance and Debt Management * Public Transportation * Rail * Real Estate Management and Development * Research and Technology Implementation * Right of Way * Strategic Contract Management * Strategic Planning * Support Services * Toll Operations * Traffic Operations * Transportation Planning and Programming * Travel Information |} Publications The 1956 edition of the Texas Official Travel Map: The Transportation Department has been publishing an official state road map since 1917.

It is also called sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling. When a text file with a shebang is used as if it is an executable in a Unix-like operating system, the program loader mechanism parses the rest of the file's initial line as an interpreter directive. The loader executes the specified interpreter program, passing to it as an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script, so that the program may use the file as input data. For example, if a script is named with the path path/to/script, and it starts with the following line, \`#!/bin/sh\`, then the program loader is instructed to run the program /bin/sh, passing path/to/script as the first argument. In Linux, this behavior is the result of both kernel and user-space code. The shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter, because the \\"#\\" character is a comment marker in many scripting languages; some language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to begin comments still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of its purpose. Syntax The form of a shebang interpreter directive is as follows: #!interpreter [optional-arg] in which interpreter is an absolute path to an executable program. The optional argument is a string representing a single argument. White space after **#!** is optional. In Linux, the file specified by interpreter can be executed if it has the execute right and contains code which the kernel can execute directly, if it has a wrapper defined for it via sysctl (such as for executing Microsoft .exe binaries using wine), or if it contains a shebang. On Linux and Minix, an interpreter can also be a script. A chain of shebangs and wrappers yields a directly executable file that gets the encountered scripts as parameters in reverse order. For example, if file /bin/A is an executable file in ELF format, file /bin/B contains the shebang #!/bin/A optparam, and file /bin/C contains the shebang #!/bin/B, then executing file /bin/C resolves to /bin/B /bin/C, which finally resolves to /bin/A optparam /bin/B /bin/C. In Solaris and Darwin derived operating systems (such as macOS) the file specified by interpreter must be an executable binary and cannot itself be a script.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45444823/python3-shebang-line-not- working-as-expected Examples Some typical shebang lines: * \`#!/bin/sh\` – Execute the file using the Bourne shell, or a compatible shell, assumed to be in the /bin directory * \`#!/bin/bash\` – Execute the file using the Bash shell * \`#!/usr/bin/env python3\` – Execute with a Python interpreter, using the program search path to find it * \`#!/bin/false\` – Do nothing, but return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure. Used to prevent stand-alone execution of a script file intended for execution in a specific context, such as by the \`.\` command from sh/bash, \`source\` from csh/tcsh, or as a .profile, .cshrc, or .login file. Shebang lines may include specific options that are passed to the interpreter. However, implementations vary in the parsing behavior of options; for portability, only one option should be specified without any embedded whitespace. Further portability guidelines are found below. Purpose Interpreter directives allow scripts and data files to be used as commands, hiding the details of their implementation from users and other programs, by removing the need to prefix scripts with their interpreter on the command line. A Bourne shell script that is identified by the path some/path/to/foo, has the initial line, #!/bin/sh -x and is executed with parameters bar and baz as some/path/to/foo bar baz provides a similar result as having actually executed the following command line instead: /bin/sh -x some/path/to/foo bar baz If /bin/sh specifies the Bourne shell, then the end result is that all of the shell commands in the file some/path/to/foo are executed with the positional variables $1 and $2 having the values bar and baz, respectively. Also, because the initial number sign is the character used to introduce comments in the Bourne shell language (and in the languages understood by many other interpreters), the whole shebang line is ignored by the interpreter. However, it is up to the interpreter to ignore the shebang line; thus, a script consisting of the following two lines simply echos both lines to standard output when run: #!/bin/cat Hello world! =Strengths= When compared to the use of global association lists between file extensions and the interpreting applications, the interpreter directive method allows users to use interpreters not known at a global system level, and without administrator rights. It also allows specific selection of interpreter, without overloading the filename extension namespace (where one file extension refers to more than one file type), and allows the implementation language of a script to be changed without changing its invocation syntax by other programs. Invokers of the script need not know what the implementation language is as the script itself is responsible for specifying the interpreter to use. Portability = Program location = Shebangs must specify absolute paths (or paths relative to current working directory) to system executables; this can cause problems on systems that have a non-standard file system layout. Even when systems have fairly standard paths, it is quite possible for variants of the same operating system to have different locations for the desired interpreter. Python, for example, might be in /usr/bin/python3, /usr/local/bin/python3, or even something like /home/username/bin/python3 if installed by an ordinary user. A similar problem exists for the POSIX shell, since POSIX only required its name to be sh, but did not mandate a path. A common value is , but some systems such as Solaris have the POSIX-compatible shell at /usr/xpg4/bin/sh. In many Linux systems, /bin/sh is a hard or symbolic link to /bin/bash, the Bourne Again shell (BASH). Using bash-specific syntax while maintaining a shebang pointing to sh is also not portable. Because of this it is sometimes required to edit the shebang line after copying a script from one computer to another because the path that was coded into the script may not apply on a new machine, depending on the consistency in past convention of placement of the interpreter. For this reason and because POSIX does not standardize path names, POSIX does not standardize the feature. Often, the program can be used to circumvent this limitation by introducing a level of indirection. is followed by , followed by the desired command without full path, as in this example: #!/usr/bin/env sh This mostly works because the path is commonly used for the utility, and it invokes the first found in the user's $PATH, typically . This still has some portability issues with OpenServer 5.0.6 and Unicos 9.0.2 which have only and no . = Character interpretation = Another portability problem is the interpretation of the command arguments. Some systems, including Linux, do not split up the arguments; for example, when running the script with the first line like, #!/usr/bin/env python3 -c That is, will be passed as one argument to , rather than two arguments. Cygwin also behaves this way. Complex interpreter invocations are possible through the use of an additional wrapper. FreeBSD 6.0 (2005) introduced a option to its as it changed the shebang- reading behavior to non-splitting. This option tells to split the string itself. The GNU utility since coreutil 8.30 (2018) also includes this feature. Although using this option mitigates the portability issue on the kernel end with splitting, it adds the requirement that supports this particular extension. Another problem is scripts containing a carriage return character immediately after the shebang line, perhaps as a result of being edited on a system that uses DOS line breaks, such as Microsoft Windows. Some systems interpret the carriage return character as part of the interpreter command, resulting in an error message. =Magic number= The shebang is actually a human-readable instance of a magic number in the executable file, the magic byte string being ', the two-character encoding in ASCII of . This magic number is detected by the \\"exec\\" family of functions, which determine whether a file is a script or an executable binary. The presence of the shebang will result in the execution of the specified executable, usually an interpreter for the script's language. It has been claimed that some old versions of Unix expect the normal shebang to be followed by a space and a slash ('), but this appears to be untrue; rather, blanks after the shebang have traditionally been allowed, and sometimes documented with a space (see the 1980 email in history section below). The shebang characters are represented by the same two bytes in extended ASCII encodings, including UTF-8, which is commonly used for scripts and other text files on current Unix-like systems. However, UTF-8 files may begin with the optional byte order mark (BOM); if the \\"exec\\" function specifically detects the bytes 0x23 and 0x21, then the presence of the BOM () before the shebang will prevent the script interpreter from being executed. Some authorities recommend against using the byte order mark in POSIX (Unix-like) scripts, for this reason and for wider interoperability and philosophical concerns. Additionally, a byte order mark is not necessary in UTF-8, as that encoding does not have endianness issues; it serves only to identify the encoding as UTF-8. Etymology An executable file starting with an interpreter directive is simply called a script, often prefaced with the name or general classification of the intended interpreter. The name shebang for the distinctive two characters may have come from an inexact contraction of SHArp bang or haSH bang, referring to the two typical Unix names for them. Another theory on the sh in shebang is that it is from the default shell sh, usually invoked with shebang. This usage was current by December 1989, and probably earlier. History The shebang was introduced by Dennis Ritchie between Edition 7 and 8 at Bell Laboratories. It was also added to the BSD releases from Berkeley's Computer Science Research (present at 2.8BSD and activated by default by 4.2BSD). As AT&T; Bell Laboratories Edition 8 Unix, and later editions, were not released to the public, the first widely known appearance of this feature was on BSD. The lack of an interpreter directive, but support for shell scripts, is apparent in the documentation from Version 7 Unix in 1979, which describes instead a facility of the Bourne shell where files with execute permission would be handled specially by the shell, which would (sometimes depending on initial characters in the script, such as \\":\\" or \\"#\\") spawn a subshell which would interpret and run the commands contained in the file. In this model, scripts would only behave as other commands if called from within a Bourne shell. An attempt to directly execute such a file via the operating system's own exec() system trap would fail, preventing scripts from behaving uniformly as normal system commands. In later versions of Unix-like systems, this inconsistency was removed. Dennis Ritchie introduced kernel support for interpreter directives in January 1980, for Version 8 Unix, with the following description: > From uucp Thu Jan 10 01:37:58 1980 >From dmr Thu Jan 10 04:25:49 1980 remote > from research The system has been changed so that if a file being executed > begins with the magic characters #! , the rest of the line is understood to > be the name of an interpreter for the executed file. Previously (and in fact > still) the shell did much of this job; it automatically executed itself on a > text file with executable mode when the text file's name was typed as a > command. Putting the facility into the system gives the following benefits. > 1) It makes shell scripts more like real executable files, because they can > be the subject of 'exec.' 2) If you do a 'ps' while such a command is > running, its real name appears instead of 'sh'. Likewise, accounting is done > on the basis of the real name. 3) Shell scripts can be set-user-ID. 4) It is > simpler to have alternate shells available; e.g. if you like the Berkeley > csh there is no question about which shell is to interpret a file. 5) It > will allow other interpreters to fit in more smoothly. To take advantage of > this wonderful opportunity, put > > > #! /bin/sh > > at the left margin of the first line of your shell scripts. Blanks after ! > are OK. Use a complete pathname (no search is done). At the moment the whole > line is restricted to 16 characters but this limit will be raised. Kernel support for interpreter directives spread to other versions of Unix, and one modern implementation can be seen in the Linux kernel source in fs/binfmt_script.c. This mechanism allows scripts to be used in virtually any context normal compiled programs can be, including as full system programs, and even as interpreters of other scripts. As a caveat, though, some early versions of kernel support limited the length of the interpreter directive to roughly 32 characters (just 16 in its first implementation), would fail to split the interpreter name from any parameters in the directive, or had other quirks. Additionally, some modern systems allow the entire mechanism to be constrained or disabled for security purposes (for example, set-user-id support has been disabled for scripts on many systems). Note that, even in systems with full kernel support for the #! magic number, some scripts lacking interpreter directives (although usually still requiring execute permission) are still runnable by virtue of the legacy script handling of the Bourne shell, still present in many of its modern descendants. Scripts are then interpreted by the user's default shell.

The group's lead singer was 17-year-old Lynne Nixon, a soprano who had had formal operatic training. The Aqua-Tones had a single Billboard Hot 100 hit, entitled \\"You\\", for the Fargo label. Their subsequent releases all failed to reach the Hot 100. They were issued into the early '60s and finally on an album that gathered together most of their songs, which was issued three years after their hit single and just before their final Fargo release in July 1961, a remake of The Heartbeats' \\"Crazy For You\\". That song was not on the original album, but was included in the reissue in the 1980s. In the late 1990s the group reformed with a new lead singer, Colette Delaney. They released a number of CDs on the Debra label of remakes and new material, including a Christmas album in 2006. Sound The Aquatones were a four-part harmony group with a female lead vocalist, Lynne Nixon (22 March 1941 - 9 January 2001). The group began in 1956 as three guys from Valley Stream, New York, called the Rhythm Kings; the members were Dave Goddard, Larry Vannata and Gene McCarthy. They came together to record a song written by Dave for their junior class play at Valley Stream Central High School. All of the guys played instruments as well as singing vocals--Gene on the clarinet and tenor sax, Larry the alto and tenor sax and Dave the piano. Bob Boden would play drums when they performed live. A classmate's father, a record distributor, heard the group and suggested that they add a high falsetto voice. Shortly thereafter Larry met Lynne Nixon at a dance and asked Gene and Dave to give her an audition. Upon hearing her voice they agreed to add her to the group. At first Lynne only sang backgrounds, until Larry wrote the song \\"You\\" for her to sing. The group later changed its name to the Aquatones (as Dave describes it. \\"so the guys could wear a 'cool' shirt from the 1950s--aqua with a black velvet 'V' down the front\\"). In 1957 the three original members decided to add Lynne as a fourth member to give the group some versatility. It was not long after the group became a foursome that they found themselves performing at a talent contest at Malverne High School. The contest, entitled \\"Stairway to the Stars\\", was just that for the group, as local real estate mogul-turned-music-promoter Lou Fargo heard them and liked what he saw and heard. In December 1957 he signed the group and off to the studio they went to record on Fargo's own label. First record Their first song was \\"You\\" (Fargo 1001 b/w \\"She's the One For Me\\"). It was a group harmony recording. The record hit on the Billboard chart in April 1958. \\"You\\" gained attention again in 1973 when it was used in the crime thriller Mean Streets, written and directed by Martin Scorsese. Such classics as \\"I Met Him on a Sunday\\" by The Shirelles, \\"Zoom Zoom Zoom\\" by The Collegians and \\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\" by Chuck Berry were out at the same time. While \\"You\\" did very well in the East, it only managed to hit #21 across America. More recently the song was featured in the TV series Mad Men, in the episode \\"Five G\\", during a scene where Don meets his younger brother at a diner, offering him money and telling him he doesn't want to have anything to do with him. Later the brother commits suicide. Previously, the song was used in a very similar context on the TV series The Sopranos, in the episode \\"Everybody Hurts\\", accompanying a disturbing dream sequence in which a character, Gloria Trillo, commits suicide. \\"You\\" is also featured in the television series Vampire Diaries, season 5, episode 7 (\\"Death and the Maiden\\"). The character Silas is sitting at a bus stop talking to a young couple. He is telling them the truth about himself, which makes them believe he's crazy. He then makes the man in the couple very ill and the woman runs away. Silas then gets on a bus going to Virginia. The song plays out over opening title card. Follow up Their follow-up record, \\"Say You'll Be Mine\\" b/w \\"So Fine\\" (Fargo 1002), again came out at a time when there were more big records being pushed by big-name artists. Their third record--\\"Our First Kiss\\" b/w \\"Drive In\\" (Fargo 1003)--was also lost in the rush. Their next release in October 1958 was \\"My Treasure\\" b/w \\"My One Desire\\" (Fargo 1005) but, while a terrific group harmony recording, it received little interest. \\"My Darling\\" b/w \\"For You, For You\\" (Fargo 1111) followed, as did \\"Crazy For You\\" b/w \\"Wanted\\" (Fargo 1016) in 1961. \\"Crazy For You\\" was a cover of the original Heartbeats' tune. Fargo would later release an album of the group's material in 1964 but their time had come and gone, not unlike the era of doo-wop itself. The Aquatones went their separate ways. Lynne Nixon died January 2001. Colette Delaney In 1998 Goddard heard a young lady sing who sounded similar to Nixon. A year later he approached the girl, Colette Delaney, about singing in a new Aquatones group. Colette had had a career in musical comedy and was interested in singing with the group. They started making \\"demo\\" recordings of some of the Aquatones' old music. The result was a new CD, released on Debra Records. The CD includes performances from the original Aquatones--Dave Goddard, Gene McCarthy and Larry Vannata.

History  The name NorduGrid first became known in 2001 as short for the project called \\"Nordic Testbed for Wide Area Computing and Data Handling\\" funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers via the Nordunet2 programme. That project's main goal was to set up a prototype of a distributed computing infrastructure (a testbed), aiming primarily at the needs of the High Energy Physics researchers in the ATLAS experiment. Following evaluation of the then existing Grid technology solutions, NorduGrid developers came up with an alternative software architecture. It was implemented and demonstrated in May 2002, and soon became known as the NorduGrid Middleware. In 2004 this middleware solution was given a proper name, the Advanced Resource Connector (ARC).ARC v0.4 Release Announcement Until May 2003, NorduGrid headquarters were in the Niels Bohr Institute; at the 5th NorduGrid Workshop it was decided to move them to the Oslo University.NorduGrid meeting notes The present-day formal collaboration was established in 2005 by five Nordic academic institutes (Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, Helsinki Institute of Physics in Finland, Oslo University in Norway, and Lund and Uppsala Universities in Sweden) with the goal to develop, support, maintain and popularize ARC. Deployment and support of the Nordic Grid infrastructure itself became the responsibility of the NDGF project, launched in June 2006. This marked clear separation between Grid middleware providers and infrastructure services providers. To further support ARC development, NorduGrid and several other interested partners secured dedicated funding through EU FP6 project KnowARC. NorduGrid Collaboration is based upon a non- binding Memorandum of Understanding and is open for new members.  Goals  The NorduGrid Collaboration is the consortium behind the ARC middleware, and its key goal is to ensure that ARC is further developed, maintained, supported and widely deployed, while remaining a free open-source software, suitable for a wide variety of high-throughput Grid computational tasks. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable, scalable, portable and full-featured solution for Grid infrastructures, conformant with open standards, primarily those developed in the framework of the Open Grid Forum. While ARC software development may and does often take place outside NorduGrid, the Collaboration coordinates contributions to the code and maintains the code and software repositories, as well as a build system, an issue tracking system and other necessary software development services. NorduGrid defines strategical directions for development of ARC and ensures financial support for it.  ARC Community  The term \\"ARC Community\\" is used to refer to various groups of people willing to share their computational resources via ARC. A tit-for-tat user group is formalized as a virtual organisation (VO), allowing the mutual use of such community resources.ARC Community Virtual Organisation Contrary to the popular belief, NorduGrid members are not required to provide computing or storage resources; neither offering such resources grants an automatic membership. Still, ARC community as a whole owns a substantial amount of computing and storage resources. On a voluntarily basis, and for the purpose of the open-source development process, community members may donate CPU cycles and some storage space to the developers and testers. Such resources constitute the testbed for the ARC middleware. Other than such donated community resources, NorduGrid does not provide or allocate any computational resources and does not coordinate worldwide deployment of ARC. Actual deployment and usage of ARC-based distributed computing infrastructures is coordinated by the respective infrastructure projects, such as e.g. NDGF, Swegrid (Sweden), Material Sciences National Grid Infrastructure (M-grid) (Finland), NorGrid (Norway) etc.. Apart from contributing computational resources, many groups develop higher-level software tools on top of ARC (e.g.Lunarc Application Portal). This kind of development is not coordinated by NorduGrid, but assistance is provided by the Collaboration upon request.  NorduGrid Certification Authority  NorduGrid Certification Authority (CA) is currently the only major infrastructure service provided by the NorduGrid. This Authority issues electronic certificates to users and services, such that they can work in Grid environments. Present day Grid implementations require X.509 certificates to validate identity of Grid participants. NorduGrid CA provides such certificates to individuals and machines associated with research and/or academic institutions in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The NorduGrid Certification Authority is a member of the European Policy Management Authority for Grid Authentication (EUGridPMA).

Its readership peaked in the early 1970s. Predecessors Pif has its origins in Le Jeune Patriote, a youth magazine published by French Communists during the German occupation of France during World War II. It was published illegally from January 1942 but became legal from 1944. In 1945 it was renamed Vaillant, Le Jeune Patriote. In 1946 its title was shortened to Vaillant, with the tag, \\"le journal le plus captivant\\" (The Most Captivating Magazine). For the April issue of 1965, the title was changed to Vaillant, le journal de Pif, due to the popularity of its character Pif, a dog character created by José Cabrero Arnal. Until 1969, Vaillant had, like its competitors, serialized some stories over several issues, but the magazine in this incarnation ended with issue number 1238 on February 23, 1969. Publication history Pif Gadget started again as a weekly magazine with issue number 1, released on February 24, 1969, but retained the old number relative to Vaillant. The magazine was called Pif et son gadget surprise for the first few months. The gadget was a 'free gift' toy with each issue, including Pifises (brine shrimp in stasis, which readers could raise as minuscule pets - known in English as sea monkeys). The cover of Pif Gadget had the strapline Tout en récits complets (all in complete stories) indicating that all the none of the comic strips were serialized over multiple issues. Its featured comics included: *Rahan *Doc Justice *Hugo Pratt's Corto Maltese *Marcel Gotlib's Gai-Luron *Nikita Mandryka's Les Aventures potagères du Concombre masqué *Raymond Poïvet and Roger Lecureux's Les Pionniers de l'Espérance *Le Grêlé 7/13, Nasdine Hodja, Arthur le fantôme justicier, Les Rigolus et les Tristus, Corinne et Jeannot, Dicentim le petit Franc. Documentary filmmaker Fredric Lean created a series based on 'Docteur Justice' for French TV network M6. Pif Gadget's record print run was one million copies, first on April 6, 1970, and again in September 1971. This set a record for a European comic strip that still stands. The paper also benefited from being able to reach the newly industrialized countries, and was one of the select few Western magazines allowed to be sold behind the Iron Curtain due to its left-wing credentials. It went into rapid decline at the same time as the Soviet Union faded, with content thinning and stories extended over several issues.

Built in 1954, it is located on Naval Station Mayport in the Mayport area. It was erected to replace a lightship, which itself replaced the still-standing Old St. Johns River Light. It is the fourth lighthouse built at the mouth of the St. Johns since 1830. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History The St. Johns Light was erected in 1954 on the grounds of Naval Station Mayport, about south of the mouth of the St. Johns River. It is the fourth lighthouse to have stood at Mayport. The first lighthouse was erected in 1830, after the U.S. purchase of Florida, but it was built too close to the water and had to be demolished just three years later. A second lighthouse was erected about a mile upriver in 1835. However, shifting sand dunes often made the light difficult to discern from sea, and by 1853 its foundation had been so affected by erosion that plans were made to replace it. It was abandoned, but its ruins could still be seen in the early 20th century.Wood, p. 326. In 1858 the Old St. Johns River Light was erected. In order to avoid the problems of its predecessors, it was constructed away from the shoreline and was substantially taller. It was in service for over 70 years until finally being decommissioned in 1929. That year it was replaced by the St. Johns Lightship (LV-84), moored about offshore of the river's mouth. The oldest surviving building in Mayport, the Old St. Johns River Lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and restored in 1980.Duval County listings at National Register of Historic Places. In 1954 the current St. Johns Light was built to replace the lightship. It was automated in 1967. The structure is made of concrete, poured in one continuous operation. It has never had a traditional lantern, but had an airway-beacon style light from the beginning until 1998 when it was replaced by a Vega VRB-25 system. The structure is tall and can be seen for . The east wing was renovated by the United States Coast Guard Northeast Florida Chapter of the Chief Petty Officers Association (CPOA). On September 26, 2014 it was dedicated to retired BMCM John G.

It was directed by Ward Kimball and narrated by Paul Frees. This episode discusses the possibility of life on other planets, especially Mars. The show was also released in theaters in 1957. Plot The film begins with an introduction by Walt Disney and his robot friend Garco, providing a brief overview of the episode. The overview starts with an animated presentation about mankind seeking to understand the world in which he lives, first noticing patterns in the stars, and developing certain beliefs regarding the celestial bodies. Theories from scientists and philosophers are discussed, including Ptolemy's inaccurate, but formerly-accepted geocentrism-related theories, as well as those of Copernicus's accurate and, now, confirmed heliocentric model. Life on other planets is considered, soon focusing on Mars. Ideas from science-fiction authors H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs are brought to life with more colorful animation, and, as done before, science fiction comics of the time are parodied. This segment also features Kimball's comic tone and a cameo appearance by Donald Duck. Later on, the program adopts a serious tone as it profiles each of the planets in the Solar System, explaining what would happen if a human were to live on each of them. The program claims that, whereas most of the planets are either too cold or too hot for life as we know it, life on Mars could almost be normal. This importance becomes the main focus of the rest of the film. Dr. E.C. Slipher then discusses the possibility of life currently on Mars. An extended sequence speculates at what the conditions on Mars might be like given sufficient water: cannibalistic plants, a trilobite-like creature which eats the dust left behind by dust storms, silicon-based lifeforms which rely solely on minerals for nutrition, leaving behind amazing and strange if ephemeral formations, and a slew of predators, including one that has radial symmetry and magnifies the Sun's rays to burn its hapless prey, and another which stuns with ultrasonics. The program wraps up with what a trip to Mars would entail for a space crew and its vessels. Contributor/spacecraft designer Ernst Stuhlinger (accompanied by Wernher von Braun) presents his design and details regarding a unique umbrella-shaped Mars Ship: The top portion would be a revolving outer quarters ring providing artificial gravity for the crew of 20 under 'parasol' coolant tubes. At the other end, a sodium-potassium reactor would provide power to the midsection electric/ion drive. Attached upright would be a chemically-fueled winged tail-lander. The mission shown involves six Mars Ships with top speeds up to that take a 400-day spiral course to Mars. There, a crew would spend 412 days on the surface before returning to Earth. Additional releases An educational film titled Cosmic Capers was edited out of this episode in 1979. It was shorter than the original and ran 18 minutes. In 2003, with the cooperation of Disney, a 35mm five-minute excerpt from Mars and Beyond was restored and presented in Don Hertzfeldt's Animation Show theatrical tour. Two clips from the episode is shown as part of a movie loop at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant at Disney's Hollywood Studios, with the clips being the introduction with Garco and the science fiction parody. This episode was released on DVD in 2004 as part of the Walt Disney Treasures line. It was added to Disney+ in June 2020.

She is one of the most prolific performers in the pop-folk music genre in Bulgaria.  Biography  Ivana was born on January 31, 1969 in Aytos, Bulgaria. A Svishtov University of Economics graduate, she then briefly studied at the Bourgas Free University, before dropping out. Meanwhile, Ivana was married and had a daughter named Teodora (Теодора).  Career  Ivana's father worked along the Black Sea coast with his orchestra. One night during a concert, after their lead singer had gotten sick, she was offered to substitute for her, singing several Bulgarian folklore songs. Ivana had great response from the audience and she was immediately offered to perform with the orchestra for the summer. She was 14 years old at the time and really liked being on stage. Later on she formed a band called \\"Prima +\\", consisting of herself, Stoyana and Rumen Radoinov. The group was invited to sing at the hotel estate \`Prikazkite\`, where Ivana’s talent was noticed by Payner music company owner – Mitko Dimitrov (), who shortly after offered her to sign a contract with the studio. Vanya Todorova Kaludova adopted the stage name Ivana and it didn't take long before she started making hits. Her first single was \`Idol\`. The second single - a duet with Kosta Markov, called \`Darvo bez koren\`(A tree without roots) - was released soon after. Her third single – \`100 patrona\` (100 bullets), which also served as her debut album title, became one of the biggest hits in the pop-folk genre in Bulgaria and still one of the biggest hits in pop-folk to date. The album was released in 2000, making her one of the hottest names in the music industry in the country. The following 8 years with her work and hits Ivana proved to be one of the biggest Bulgarian stars. Often cited \\"the people's singer\\" by the media and her fans, she is loved by many, not only for her music, but also for her cheerful persona and easy communication with her fans.

Exhibit in Sejny (Poland) in July 2009 Elio Ciol (born 1929) is an Italian photographer and publisher who was born in Casarsa della Delizia in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the region where he has principally lived and worked. His father was a photographer who kept a studio in their hometown and Elio was fascinated by the technical aspects and worked in the darkroom as a boy. A formative experience was when, during the Nazi occupation, a German doctor brought in films with photographs of the countryside rather than of people, \\"photographs that I myself should have been able to do and which I had not done or even imagined.\\"Italia Black and White, pp. xxv-xxvi. He began practising photography at fifteen, worked full-time in the studio from nineteen, and spent an increasing amount of his free time taking photographs for his own interests. A trip to Assisi in 1951 made a great impression; Ciol subsequently spent much time there, taking many photographs. Dissatisfied with the conventions demanded in Italian photographic contests, Ciol ambitiously entered contests abroad; in 1955 and 1956 he was encouraged by favorable mentions in the American magazine Popular Photography. Ciol was greatly influenced by the ideas of Luigi Crocenzi, emphasizing sequence rather than single images when illustrating a book or other story (an example had been Crocenzi's Conversazione in Sicilia, with text by Elio Vittorini). Ciol moved to Milan in 1963 to work on projects for the firm of Altimani; this soon ran into financial difficulties and Ciol returned to Casarsa, but invigorated with new ideas for the illustration and layout of books. He has illustrated dozens of books since that time. Ciol has concentrated on creating a photographic record and archive of Italian works of art, architecture, landscapes, and archaeological sites and artefacts, particularly in Friuli. His works are black and white, sometimes employing infrared-sensitive film. Some of his photographs show people so close as to be recognizable, but more often people appear as small figures within landscapes. More often still the landscapes are devoid of people.

Its harbor is one of only two on the island, together with that of Hilo. Description Aerial view of Kawaihae Harbor The town's harbor includes a fuel depot, shipping terminal and military landing site. Outside of the man- made breakwall of the harbor is a popular surf spot and the Pua Kailima o Kawaihae Cultural Surf Park. The small town features a handful of restaurants and art galleries. To the north of the harbor is the Kawaihae Canoe Club and a small boat ramp. To the south is Puukoholā Heiau national historic site, built by King Kamehameha I in 1791. Also to the south is the smaller Mailekini Heiau and the Hale o Kapuni Heiau (shark heiau), which is submerged. History Kawaihae served as the seat of kingdom of Hawaii island during the reign of the usurper king Alapainuiakauaua, whose family, the Mahi's, hailed from the Kohala district; he was the king that sought to kill the infant Kamehameha at his birth. His successor Kalaniʻōpuʻu, who overthrew Alapai's son Keaweopala, moved the capital back to the Kona district where his family originated. In the late 1700s, Kawaihae's naturally sheltered bay was considered one of the more suitable commercial harbor for western ships on the Big Island. Its harbor and proximity to the fertile uplands of Waimea ensured its status as an important stopover for many early European voyagers and merchantmen needing to make repairs and resupply their ships during the early period of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kawaihae or \\"Too-yah-yah\\" was first sighted by James King, serving under Captain Cook, on February 6, 1779, after departing from Cook's initial visit to Kealakekua Bay. Failure to find anchorage prompted them to return to Kealakekua Bay, where Cook met his demise. King returned a few months later after Cook's death, but was not impressed with the area he deemed \\"little cultivated\\" or the people, whom he called \\"of the lowest class that inhabited [the islands]\\". =Residence of King Kamehameha I= It became the principal residence of King Kamehameha I from 1790 to 1794 where he built the Puukoholā Heiau and sacrificed Keōua Kuahuula, his last opponent on the Big Island, and where he plotted out his conquest of the remaining islands in the archipelago. He lived in the royal compound of \\"Pelekane\\" on the shoreline northwest of Mailekini Heiau, which he named after the Hawaiianized name for Britain. Kamehameha's British advisor John Young also resided in the vicinity of Kawaihae with his family, and the ruins of their homestead, the remains of what is believed to be the first western-style house in Hawaii, could still be seen today near the Puukoholā Heiau.http://www.nps.gov/puhe/historyculture/homestead.htm Another British explorer, George Vancouver, the first to successfully anchor off Kawaihae Bay on February 14, 1793, paid a visit to King Kamehameha and John Young and gave the king cattle, introducing the species for the first time to Hawaii. After the development of Parker Ranch by John Palmer Parker, Kawaihae served as the main center for loading and shipping cattle and beef in Hawaii. It was in Kawaihae, on April 1, 1820, that the first company of American missionaries to Hawaii led by Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston, who later founded Mokuaikaua Church in Kailua Kona, arrived aboard the Thaddeus and set foot on the islands. Kawaihae thrived for the duration of the sandalwood trade, which depleted its forest, and the whaling age. Whalers and merchant ships annually visited its harbor, where they would stock up on agricultural products and beef from the region. But by the late 1800s, Kawaihae had declined in importance due to the end of whaling, the decimation of its population by foreign diseases and migration of its people to other parts of Hawaii; it became a sleeping and forgotten village serving mainly as a cattle landing. =Construction of harbor= The United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor and built the breakwall between 1957 and 1959 and brought the village back from obscurity. In 1970, construction of a small boat harbor began to the south of the main harbor entrance by several institutions under the name of Project Tugboat. It was designed as a test of the use of high explosives to create harbors in hard substrate and as a proof of the concept that small nuclear charges could be used for civil works projects. Over 100 tons of conventional explosives (roughly equivalent to the smallest nuclear charge that could be built at that time) were buried in the Kawaihae reef and detonated to clear the basin and the entrance. It is the home of Kawaihae Canoe Club. It also served as the launching point for the film Waterworld with Kevin Costner. The artificial reef or floating island was just off the coast with headquarters for the movie at the harbor.

The player can choose to play either of two storylines: that of Bradwen the Celt or that of Christian Bradwen. In both storylines, he is the illegitimate son of the dying King Cadfanan, leader of the Atrebates tribe shortly following the Roman occupation. Bradwen's goal is to foil the evil attempts of his half-brother Morganor (heir to the throne) at securing a malevolent kingship for himself through which enactment of his evil intentions will be made possible. It was released on October 2000 in North America, and on November 2000 in Europe. Gameplay Plot Bradwen has two alternate paths that can be played through in Arthur's Knights: Tales of Chivalry. Prior to choosing which path shall be followed, the game opens with the player in control of a young page (newly a squire) who trots off to converse with a gentleman by the name of Master Foulque, who, it would appear, is a librarian and historiographer. After some discourse with Master Foulque, the player is presented with the choice of deciding between a red book and a white book (determining which story, Celtic or Christian, respectively, of Bradwen shall be told). Both stories take place shortly after the departure of the Romans from Britain. This epoch marks a time in which Christianity has been somewhat imposed upon the native populace of Britain thus majorly extinguishing what in the game is described as \\"an age of Kings and Queens, Monsters and Magic\\" (not to mention fairies and otherwise traditionally Celtic and pagan concepts). Controversy erupts when the decampment of the Romans leaves the British tribes in conflict over political power (thus leaving them disunited and therefore vulnerable to their common enemies, the Saxons). The barbaric Saxons pose a particular threat to reestablishing a semblance of order in the land. Bradwen's role in all this is to embark on a series of missions when his half- brother informs him of the necessity for a cure for Cadfanan, their father and king. Ultimately, both Bradwens encounter fairies, dragons, King Arthur, Merlin, and even the Devil during travels through Camelot, the mystical realm of Avalon, and a plethora of other lands. Bradwen also, regardless of the religion to which he cleaves, eventually seek justice against the treacherous actions of his half-brother which develop during gameplay. Throughout the game are interspersed some historical facts about Roman Britain, post-Roman Britain, tidbits on the legend of King Arthur, and several allusions to Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel The Mists of Avalon. Development Reception Sequel Arthur's Knights: Tales of Chivalry was followed in 2002 by Arthur's Knights II: The Secret of Merlin.

Besides from the transmissions received by Karmapa, Rinpoche received high transmissions from various great masters within the other 3 lineages (Gelug, Sakya, Nyingma) of Tibetan Buddhism.https://buddhism-today.org/teachers/lopon- tsechu-rinpoche/  Activity  From his base in Kathmandu, Nepal Lopon Tsechu was a key figure in nurturing the development of Buddhism in Nepal following the occupation of Tibet by China. He exerted a formidable influence throughout the diverse Buddhist community in Nepal and was respected both as a great lama and also a skilled politician. In the 1980s the Nepalese king, and government appointed Rinpoche as responsible for the Buddhist activity in Nepal. Thereby Rinpoche sought to share the government donations between 2,000 monasteries in Nepal. Further Rinpoche used much time and energy to help the existing monasteries and giving advice on new projects. Rinpoche had this position for more than 20 years. Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche first came to the West in 1988 to give teachings and transmissions to many students. Over the next fifteen years Lopon Tsechu ministered to thousands of people in Europe, Russia and America.The Life of Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche In 1997 Rinpoche established the Buddha Dharma Centre, a monastery near the Swayambhunath in Kathmandu. Lopon Tsechu built many stupas, monuments symbolising the Enlightened mind of the Buddha, in both the East and the West. The crown jewel of his career, and one of his greatest legacies, is Benalmádena Stupa, located in Benalmádena, Spain. Inaugurated in 2003, it stands at 33 metres (or 108 feet) tall, making it the largest stupa in the Western world.Largest Buddhist Stupa Rises in Spain Lopon Tsechu became the first teacher of Ole Nydahl, the founder and leader of Diamond Way Buddhism in the West. Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche died on June 10, 2003. He was one of the last of his generation of Lamas trained in the old Tibet.

It starts at Avenue D as East 4th Street and continues to Broadway, where it becomes West 4th Street. It continues west until the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), where West 4th Street turns north and confusingly intersects with West 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Streets in Greenwich Village. Most of the street has the same width between curbstones as others in the prevailing street grid, striped as two curbside lanes and one traffic lane, with one-way traffic eastbound. The portion from Seventh to Eighth Avenues is westbound (northbound geographically) and is approximately wide, a legacy of the original Greenwich Village street grid. The section of four short blocks from MacDougal Street to University Place which forms the southern border of Washington Square Park is called Washington Square South.\\"Washington Square South\\" Google Maps The north/south portion (from Sixth Avenue to 13th Street) was formerly called Asylum Street, after the Orphan Asylum Society, which stood on Asylum Street between Bank Street and Troy Street (now West 12th Street). The asylum was demolished in 1833 and the street was renamed West 4th Street. Later, the cross streets (Amos, Hammond, and Troy) were renamed West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets, causing the current confusion.

The field of view has a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 16–35mm, which is analogous to the EF 16–35mm 2.8L on a full-frame camera. The 10–22mm is an internal focusing lens. Of the 13 elements, one is of Canon's Super Ultra-Low Dispersion glass and three are aspherical elements. Reception =Praise= The 10–22 is considered to have good image quality (sharp and low distortion) and build. The optical construction is similar to L-series lenses, but it is not designated as L-series (as reflected in the build quality), which some have argued is for marketing reasons, as with the 17–55. * \\"This is an extremely sharp lens, at all three tested focal lengths.\\" * \\"There is moderate barrel distortion at 10mm, a negligible amount at 15mm, and only a tiny amount of pincushion distortion at 22mm. Overall, exemplary performance in this measure.\\" * \\"This lens is small, light and solidly built. Sometimes Canon's non-L series lenses can feel a bit cheap, but not this one. … there is little to fault about it with regard to either fit or finish.\\" =Criticism= Cost is the biggest criticism; until fairly recently, the 10–22 cost as much as many L-series lenses, but is only usable on APS-C cameras, and thus is questionable as a long-term investment. Others think this less of a concern. Chromatic aberration is somewhat high at 10mm, and vignetting is measurable at 10mm and maximum aperture (0.85 EV units), but not terribly noticeable in normal use. Use Optimal aperture (for sharpness and to reduce vignetting) is 5.6 to 8; 8 is particularly recommended at 22mm. Filters exacerbate vignetting, hence thin filters are recommended at 10mm, and stacking filters is discouraged. Similar lenses In May 2014, Canon announced a less expensive alternative wide-angle zoom for APS-C bodies, the EF-S 10–18mm. The new lens, which is being sold alongside the 10–22, is slower than the 10–22 (maximum aperture range of 4.5–5.6) and also lacks a USM motor, but adds both image stabilization and Canon's stepping motor technology. It is also smaller and lighter than the 10–22. Sigma offers two ultra-wide angle lenses for APS-C sensors—the 8–16 DC and 10–20 DC. Tamron also offers a 10–24mm ultra-wide zoom lens for APS-C cameras as well as an older 11–18mm lens.

It features actor Bruce Willis, who provides the main character's likeness and voice. It was the first original game by Neversoft, prior to launching their Tony Hawk franchise. Plot A brilliant evil scientist named \\"The Reverend\\" has created a powerful theocracy based on the idea of a rapidly approaching apocalypse. He uses his expertise to create four powerful \\"Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\", War, Plague, Beast and Death, in order to ensure this comes to pass. His former colleague, Trey Kincaid (voiced by Bruce Willis), is the only man with the know-how to stop the Reverend, but is locked up in jail and must escape in order to save the world. Gameplay The player is fighting a tank. The display in the top-right shows that the player is using the rocket launcher, and the blue bar coming down from it indicates how much ammunition is remaining for that weapon. Apocalypse is a 3D multidirectional shooter. The character is moved using the DualShock controller's left analog stick, and shooting is handled independently by pressing the right stick in a given direction, which automatically fires the current weapon in said direction. Alternately, movement may be controlled through the directional pad and shooting performed by using the four face buttons on a typical PlayStation controller (which lack analog sticks), where the buttons' placement on the controller correspond with the fire direction. Using the shoulder buttons it is also possible to duck or jump, and a selection of different weapons are available. Development The game engine for Apocalypse was completed in January 1996. Initially, the player character was a mercenary accompanied by an AI-controlled partner, Trey Kincaid, in an effort to create the video game equivalent of a buddy film. Activision later signed a multi-million-dollar deal for Bruce Willis to provide Trey Kincaid's voice and likeness, using \\"cyber-scanning\\" and motion capture. Trey Kincaid's role was eventually changed to that of the main playable character, thus reducing the necessity for him to have as much spoken dialogue as was originally intended as the scope of Bruce Willis' involvement decreased as development went on. In the finished game, Willis' vocal contributions are limited mostly to the occasional one-liner and a few brief lines of dialogue in story sequences. Willis' face was photo-mapped onto Trey Kincaid's character model. His motion capture performance was recorded at House of Moves, a film studio in Venice, CA. The sessions were held in mid-January 1997 and took two days. During voice recording, Willis made a number of suggestions of changes to the dialogue, which the developers agreed to. Poe was cast as the character Plague using the same combination of cyber-scanning, motion capture, and voice recording as done with Willis. Apocalypse features several songs from various artists, including Poe and System of a Down. Technology developed for the game allowed live-action music videos from these artists to be projected on large screens within the game's environments. A three-level \\"buddy AI\\" was developed for Kincaid, enabling Kincaid to take up aggressive or defensive approaches and attempt to get power-ups before the player character. The game was demonstrated at the June 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo, with Willis present to help promote it. At this time the AI-controlled partner mechanic was still in place, and the game was set to release in September 1997. However, the game had been delayed to a later release date of November 17, 1998. The Apocalypse game engine was reworked for use on Neversoft's next title, the seminal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Already having in mind that they were going to begin work on Tony Hawk following completion of Apocalypse, the team said they had developed rough in-house playable demos of Trey Kincaid skateboarding around Apocalypses game environments in order to experiment with the way they wanted Tony Hawk to feel. Even though Neversoft continued to develop and evolve the engine primarily to suit the needs of the Tony Hawk series, it was also put to use in another action title by the team, the popular Spider-Man game they released in 2000. The aspect of the engine that allowed for the live-action music videos to be displayed within Apocalypses game world was also utilized in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater as well as other subsequent Neversoft titles. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised the game's gameplay as a shooter while criticising the voice acting for lacking any feeling and variety the game had. Next Generation called it \\"an action title that is average at best. There really is nothing new or innovative here. And in this fourth generation of PlayStation games, this is simply not acceptable.\\" In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Success on September 22, 1999, Famitsu gave it a score of 22 out of 40.

It is part of Lika region. Geography Josipdol is situated in the Ogulin-Plaški valley which together with Lika and Gorski Kotar forms Mountainous Croatia. The town is located at the crossroads of state roads D-23, which connects Karlovac and Senj (Jozefin road), and D-42, which connects Vrbovsko and Plitvice. Josipdol is located 10 km southeast from Ogulin, 14 km northwest from Plaški and 45 km southwest from Karlovac. Demographics According to the 2011 census, the town had a population of 879 with a total municipality population of 3,773, of which 90% were Croats and 9% were Serbs. Serbs form the majority in the village of Trojvrh. History Scarce archaeological remains near Oštarije village show that the area was settled in the Neolithic. Remains from the Copper Age show that the area was the southernmost part of Lasinja culture. The first known inhabitants of the area were the Illyrian tribe of Japods, which lived here from the late Bronze Age. In this area the Japods had two strongholds, Tetrapones, east of today's town Josipdol and Metulum, north of the town. On the north the Japods bordered with Celts and random remains of Celtic coins were found in the area. In the period 35-33 B.C. future Roman Emperor Octavian conquered the Japod areas and incorporated them into the Roman Empire. Although no physical remains of any Roman road has been found it is believed that through this area passed the Yantar road, which connected the Baltic with the Adriatic. During this period Metulum had municipality status which is proved by a script from Diocletian's time. In the 7th century Slavs came to colonize the Balkan area and founded a settlement Modruš in the Josipdol area. In the 9th century, Modruš is mentioned as the site of the Borna and Ljudevit Posavski confrontation. In 1102 Croatia joined personal union with Hungary and the Hungarians formed new territorial units called Župas; Modruš became the seat of one of these Župas and soon became the seat of the Krbava-Modruš episcopacy. In the 12th century, Modruš became a possession of the Frankopan family. Because it was on a road that connected the interior with the coast, Modruš became an important traffic and trade center. This was the golden age for Modruš, which lasted until wars with the Ottomans in the 15th century, when it was raided several times. As Croatia became part of the Habsburg empire Modruš became part of the Military Frontier and a new population settled the area. In 1775, emperor Joseph II visited Josipdol.http://www.ogulin.hr/kultura-2/sakralni-objekti/josipdol In 1776, Austrian authorities began to build the road that would connect Karlovac with Senj and Josipdol was founded as a traffic and trade center on the road. The road was named Josephina and it is still in use today. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a railway from Ogulin to Split was built which passed Josipdol. The railway accelerated the industrial growth of the town and a wood industry was founded. The Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995) affected the south- eastern part of the municipality, which led to depopulation of the area. In the 21st century it was one of the centers where the Zagreb-Split motorway was built and many locals found jobs in constructing it. In 2003 the first part of the road was opened on the Bosiljevo-Josipdol part. Economy Economy is mostly based on agriculture, harvesting potatoes, mushrooms and fruit. There also couple of smaller sawmills. In 2003 municipality experienced economic boom because of building motorway Zagreb-Split nearby. Josipdol was one of the construction centers and many locals found job in construction of motorway.

He was also a barrister and judge, who served briefly as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Career He was the son of William Napier and Rosetta MacNaghten of Ballyreagh House, County Antrim, and was born in Belfast, Ireland, where his father was a prosperous brewer. He attended the Belfast Academical Institution and Trinity College, Dublin, before being called to the Irish Bar in 1831. He built up a very large practice, and acquired an impressive reputation for learning, especially in the area of pleading.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 London John Murray 1926 p.295 He became a Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1844. He was MP for Dublin University from 1848 to 1858, after failing to be elected in 1847. He became Attorney General for Ireland from March to December 1852. He was also made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland 1852. He received a Doctorate of Civil Law in 1853. Napier was a staunch Tory in politics, and exceptionally diligent in attending to his political duties.Ball p.295 He left the House of Commons when he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1858, an office he held until 1859. His appointment caused some surprise, since he had made his reputation in the courts of common law, although he also did some chancery work.Ball p.295 He was created a Baronet in 1867 and appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1868, which entitled him to sit on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Despite his obvious wish to return to office, he never became Chancellor again: even in the Tory party his strong Evangelical views had made him enemies, while the Bar complained that his deafness made it impossible for him to conduct business efficiently. He accepted the position of Lord Justice of Appeal, but the reaction from the Bar was so unfavourable (his deafness rather than his religious beliefs seems to have been the issue) that he withdrew. His publications include educational, mathematical and legal works. In 1880 he retired to St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex and died there on 9 December 1882. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin with a tablet to his memory placed in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Reputation  He was remembered as a learned jurist and a diligent Parliamentarian, but above all as a devout Protestant with a deep devotion to the Church of Ireland, whose disestablishment he fiercely opposed. When young he was an extreme Evangelical, and strongly opposed to Catholic Emancipation, but it is said that his views mellowed as he grew older. His early views led to a clash with Daniel O'Connell, who nicknamed him \\"Holy Joe\\". Family He married Charity (Cherry) Grace, daughter of John Grace of Dublin (from an old Kilkenny family), on 20 August 1831 and had 2 sons: William John Napier and Sir Joseph Napier, 2nd Baronet, and 3 daughters: Grace, Rosetta and Cherry. Lady Napier died 4 March 1901. One of his sisters, Rosetta Napier, married James Whiteside, Attorney General for Ireland and later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and another sister, Mary Napier, married Echlin Molyneux who later became a Professor of English Law at Queen's University Belfast; she died young in 1831.

It is also called 'reddish one-pot dish' and varies in these countries. Geographical range, history and origin Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients, for example, in Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu jën or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is \\"mutually intelligible\\" across the regions had become the best known African dish outside the continent.. Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire. Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \\"linguistic, historical or political patterns\\". Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \\"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\\" as well as the religion of Islam. Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. It may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tijāniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually. Ingredients Fried rice, jollof rice and salad, served with grilled chicken Jollof rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil, vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and scotch bonnet. To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (purée) is added. As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used. To complement the dish, red and white meats (I.e. chicken, turkey, beef), and fish are often served with the dish. =Nutrition= The main ingredients of jollof rice are rice and tomatoes; neither has any saturated fat or cholesterol. The addition of palm oil does add saturated fat. Jollof is primarily carbohydrates, as it is a rice dish. Since jollof is often served with chicken, beef, and/or turkey, it is complemented by the protein from those accompanying dishes. Fish is sometimes used as an accompaniment, and can provide the dish with omega-3 fatty acids, as well as protein. Nigerian and Ghanaian rivalry Due to the differences in regional recipes, the various regions where jollof rice is common are competitive over which variant tastes the best. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana. These differences have brought about the \\"Jollof Wars\\" between Nigeria and Ghana. =Nigerian jollof= Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice and there are variations of the classic jollof rice; including coconut jollof rice, fisherman jollof rice (made with prawns, periwinkles, crayfish), mixed vegetables jollof rice, and rice and beans. More economical versions of jollof rice are popularly referred to among Nigerians as “concoction rice,” the preparation of which can involve as little as rice and pepper. =Ghanaian jollof= Ghanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked. The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste,tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables. Jollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.

The Coalition was formed in June 2005 by a group of undergraduate students frustrated with the University's tuition hikes and meager financial aid packages.  Background  In 2005, Princeton Review ranked New York University No. 1 in the category of \\"Students Dissatisfied with Financial Aid\\". Since 2000, the cost of tuition at NYU has increased by $6,000 and the average per-borrower cumulative debt grew by $10,633. A 2006-graduating senior receiving no grants will end up paying an extra $10,342 in aggregated tuition hikes from the original price tag NYU presented him/her as an incoming student. NYU also routinely raises tuition as much as 3 times the inflation rate. As a result, students at NYU graduate with one of the largest debts in the country. The Tuition Reform Action Coalition's reform platform was formed in response to these circumstances.  Platform  Almost 2,200 students and community members and over 30 student organizations have endorsed TRAC's platform, calling on the University to: #Guarantee a stabilized tuition rate for undergraduate students by aligning any tuition increases to the annual inflation rate.

Service One of eight regiments raised by Maine in the fall of 1862 under the call for men to serve nine-month terms, the 27th Maine was formed primarily of volunteers from York County, Maine. They went into camp at Portland, Maine, on 10 September, with the officers being mustered into service on the 19th and the enlisted men on the 30th. After a short furlough home, and the addition of a few later enlistments to complete the regiment, they left for Washington, D.C. on 20 October 1862. The unit was attached to the XXII Corps, first belonging to Casey's Division and later to the division of General John Joseph Abercrombie. They served as pickets in the defenses of the capital through their entire term. First encamped on East Capitol Hill upon their arrival in Washington, they soon moved to Arlington Heights, Virginia and afterward to Hunting Creek, where they went into winter quarters until March 1863. In the spring, they relocated along with the 25th Maine to Chantilly, Virginia and were there until 25 June, when they were transferred into the Army of the Potomac and ordered to report to General Slocum and the XII Corps at Leesburg, Virginia.1863 Adj Rep, pg 101 This order was quickly changed, as it had not been known that the 1st Brigade (25th Maine and 27th Maine) were only nine-month units and their terms were about to expire, so they were instead sent to Arlington Heights for preparations to their mustering out and subsequent return to Maine. Volunteer service and the Medal of Honor On the request of President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton sent letters on 28 June 1863 to the commanding officers of the 25th Maine and 27th Maine regiments, asking for them to remain beyond their contracted service due to the invasion of Pennsylvania by Robert E. Lee and his army. Declined first by the 25th Maine, the 27th was then asked, and over 300 men volunteered to remain beyond their service time in the defenses of Washington during what became the Gettysburg Campaign. When Colonel Wentworth delivered the message to Secretary Stanton, he was informed that \\"Medals of Honor would be given to that portion of the regiment that volunteered to remain\\".Pullen, pg 72. At this time of this action, the Medal of Honor (via Acts of Congress on 12 July 1862 and 3 March 1863) could be presented to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves for the gallantry in action and other soldier-like qualities during the present insurrection With the battle soon over, they left Washington for home on 4 July, reuniting with the rest of the regiment in Portland for their mustering out on 17 July 1863. Following the end of the war, when the promise to award medals to the volunteers was fulfilled, there was a lack of an agreeable list of those who stayed behind in Washington. This resulted in some 864 medals being made, and it was left up to Wentworth to distribute them to those members he remembered staying behind with him. The MOH awarded to George Washington Emmons can be seen at Old Gordon Gravestones These medals were later purged by Congress in 1917 as the actions of the regiment did not meet the criteria for receiving such a medal.Pullen, pg 139 Commanders With Colonel Rufus Tapley leaving the regiment in January 1863, Lieutenant Colonel Mark F. Wentworth resumed command of the unit. He was formerly of the Kittery militia, and stationed at Fort McClary during the early part of the Civil War. Following his service in the 27th Maine, he became commanding officer of the 32nd Maine Infantry Volunteers in February 1864, but had to resign on October due to being seriously wounded at the Battle of the Crater in July. Complement and casualties There were a total of 949 men listed on the muster rolls for the 27th Maine. During their service, the regiment lost nineteen men by disease and one was killed by the accidental discharge of his musket.1863 Adj Rep, pgs 748-772 See also * Medal of Honor * List of Maine Civil War units * Maine in the American Civil War Bibliography *Hodsdon, John L, Adj Gen (1863).

It is common throughout its range, which extends from eastern central Nicaragua through Costa Rica and northwestern Panama. The species is often found in humid lowlands and premontane forest, but large populations are also found in disturbed areas such as plantations.Savage, J. M. 2002. The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica. University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London. The strawberry poison frog is perhaps most famous for its widespread variation in coloration, comprising approximately 15-30 color morphs, most of which are presumed to be true-breeding. O. pumilio, while not the most poisonous of the dendrobatids, is the most toxic member of its genus. Diet The diet of O. pumilio causes the skin of the amphibian to become toxic in nature when certain subspecies of mites and ants are ingested. Alkaloid toxins are organic in nature and contain nitrogenous bases that react with carbon and hydrogen groups. Pumiliotoxin 251D is the specialized toxin that is sequestered by this species of frog. This toxin has a negative stimulating effect on cardiac function and is a severe disruptor of the sodium potassium ion channels within cells. Upon ingestion of Pumiliotoxin 251D, organisms preying on O. pumilio experience convulsions, paralysis, and death. It has been found that once O.pumilio reaches sexual maturity, their granular glands significantly increase in size and their diet shifts. In females, it is common to find about 53% more alkaloids than adult males. Oribatida mites belonging to the glandulate suborder Brachypylina are an important origin of pumiliotoxins in O. pumilio. Hexane-extraction techniques indicate presence of alkaloid toxins in Brachypylina. Toxins appear to be biosynthesized in adult mites, as nymph and larval stages of the arachnid do not carry the toxins. Experimental analysis of this species of mite show alkaloid toxins are found almost exclusively in the opisthonotal glands of mites of the Scheloribatidae. Oil glands of the mite contain the toxins and are then released internally as the amphibian digests the arthropod. O. pumilio can also attribute its cutaneous toxicity to its rich diet of formicinae ants. Species of the formicine genus Brachymyrmex contain pumiliotoxins which the frogs incorporate and accumulate poison from. There is a variability of alkaloid profiles among populations and individuals of O. pumilio, which is indicative of varying levels of available prey within their infraspecific habitats. Research and physical analysis reveal that maternally derived alkaloids exist in young tadpoles. The increase in alkaloids in tadpoles suggests that the females are providing more chemical defenses to their more vulnerable young. This being one of the first found examples of provisioning that occurs after hatching. During tadpole-rearing, mother frogs feed their young an unfertilized egg from their ovaries after dropping each individual tadpole into a repository of water usually found in a bromeliad.Forsyth, A., Fogden, M., Fogden, P., Wilson, E. O., 2008. Nature of the Rainforest: Costa Rica and Beyond. Cornell University Press. Ithaca, New York, USA. Tadpoles lacking the obligate nutritive egg diet do not contain the alkaloid. This step is crucial for the tadpoles to sequester the alkaloid from their mother; without such, young tadpoles become susceptible to predation by arthropods and other frogs.  Behavior  Oophaga pumilio is diurnal and primarily terrestrial, and can often be found in leaf litter in both forested and disturbed areas.Studies have shown that the optimal habitat is determined by the male, considering the resource benefits and defense costs. Males tend to expend more energy defending smaller but higher quality areas. There has also been evidence that the better competitors and fighters are the males guarding smaller sites with higher female density. In most Anura the louder the vocalization when competing usually means they are larger in size and in better health. However, in the O. pumilio species researchers have determined that these frogs call out at a lower rate to limit their energetic expenditures. Females, on the other hand, simply distribute themselves according to tadpole rearing sites. Though brightly colored and toxic, these frogs are relatively small, growing to approximately in standard length.  Reproduction and parental care  Oophaga pumilio is an external breeder, and other species of the genus Oophaga are notable in the amphibian world for exhibiting a high degree of parental care. The strawberry poison frog has dual parental care. The males defend and water the nests, and the females feed the oophagous tadpoles their unfertilized eggs. Although both male and female contribute to parental care, females invest more heavily in terms of energy expenditure, time investment, and loss of potential reproduction. When choosing a partner for mating, females will choose the closest calling male rather than the highest quality male. Females provide unfertilized eggs to the tadpoles for 6–8 weeks (until metamorphosis), remains sexually inactive during tadpole rearing, and care for only one clutch of four to six tadpoles at a time. The males, contribute via the act of watering and protecting the eggs for a relatively short period (10–12 days), and can care for multiple nests at one time. The extreme maternal investment in their offspring is believed to be the result of high egg mortality. Only 5-12% of the clutch develops into tadpoles, so the female's fitness may be best increased by making sure those few eggs that form tadpoles survive. The la gruta morph from Colón Province, Panama After mating, the female lays three to five eggs on a leaf or bromeliad axil. The male then ensures the eggs are kept hydrated by transporting water in his cloaca. After about 10 days, the eggs hatch and the female transports the tadpoles on her back to some water-filled location. In captivity, on rare occasions, the male is observed transporting the tadpoles, though whether this is intentional, or the tadpoles simply hitch a ride, is unknown. Bromeliad axils are frequently used tadpole deposition sites, but anything suitable can be used, such as knots in trees, small puddles, or human trash such as aluminum cans. Tadpoles are deposited singly at each location. Once this has been done, the female will come to each tadpole every few days and deposit several unfertilized food eggs. In captivity, tadpoles have been raised on a variety of diets, ranging from algae to the eggs of other dart frogs, but with minimal success. O. pumilio tadpoles are considered obligate egg feeders, as they are unable to accept any other form of nutrition. After about a month, the tadpole will metamorphose into a small froglet. Generally, it stays near its water source for a few days for protection as it absorbs the rest of its tail.  Taxonomy  Oophaga pumilio belongs to the genus Oophaga, although the name Dendrobates pumilio is still sometimes used. There is evidence that the species of Oophaga (previously classified as the \\"female parental care group\\" of Dendrobates) are a monophyletic evolutionary group. Due to the low level of genetic divergence between the species analyzed in this genus, it is estimated that they speciated relatively recently, after the formation of the current Panamanian land bridge in the Pliocene (3-5 million years ago). Oophaga pumilio is believed to be most closely related to Oophaga arborea. Evolution Strawberry poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, shows extreme variation in color and pattern between populations that have been geographically isolated for more than 10,000 years. When populations are separated by geographic distances and landscape barriers, they frequently experience restricted gene flow, which can enable phenotypic divergence between populations through selection or drift. Their variety in warning coloration is used for their visibility, toxicity and resistance to predators. When divergent phenotypes are mostly restricted to separate islands, the biogeography of color polymorphism suggests a major role for neutral process. However, Summers et al. (1997) provide evidences that neutral divergence alone is unlikely to have caused the variation in color patterns. As shown by Lande, rapid evolution in sexually selecting species is led by the interaction of random genetic drift with natural and sexual selection such as random genetic drift in female mating preferences. Color is known to play a role in male–female signaling, mate attraction, and male–male signaling in anurans. Based on Tazzyman and Iwasa's study that involved collections of samples from main islands in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, its results proved that female preference on male calls led to call divergence and therefore divergence was driven by sexual selection. Mate choice plays a critical role in generating and maintaining biodiversity. Furthermore, spatial variation in predators or habitat features could exert divergent natural selection on coloration in response to its subjection to predator selection. It is still unclear to what extent sexual selection has driven the evolution of color morphs rather than reinforcing the reproductive isolation of morphs. In an aposematic organism such as Oophaga pumilio, we cannot attribute a phylogenetic signal of selection to female mate choice alone but is quite possible that genetic drift would interact with female color preferences to trigger divergence Researchers Maan and Cummings had also found that in some cases female Oophaga Pumilio preferred male mates that had very different coloration than their own phenotype. In nature the equality of color through evolution is very unlikely considering the various sensory biases of predators and the different background colors of the environments these frogs habitat. Due to this variability in color evolution, it is unlikely to say there is superiority of aposematic purpose of color selection in the OophaSpecies such as Oophaga Pumilio have been known to thrive and compete very well on disturbed and converted land. With temperatures rising in many different biomes, the success of many species is going to be determined by its ability to acclimate and adapt. In the study done by Rivera and Nowakowski, they discovered that in many cases O.pumilio is experiencing greater temperature stress in converted habitats than forestsga Pumilio species.  Habitat Niche  . These frog species utilize scattered structures throughout these disturbed lands to relieve some of the thermal stress, yet it was found that O. pumilio is still warmer than any other species in the forested areas, being exposed to temperatures up to 27 degrees Celsius. These findings suggest that this species of dart frog acts as an ecological buffer and is predicted to be more successful than other species as land use changes and temperatures rise.  Captivity  Oophaga pumilio is a popular frog in captivity, due to its striking colors and unique life cycle. They have been imported in vast quantities to the United States and Europe since the early 1990s, when they would typically be available for around US$75 each. However, these shipments have since stopped, and O. pumilio is much less common and available in reduced diversity. In Europe, O. pumilio is much more diverse and available due to an increased frequency of smuggling and the resulting offspring of smuggled animals. Smuggling of dart frogs is less common elsewhere, but still problematic as it kills large numbers of animals and frequently degrades or destroys viable habitat. \\"Blue jeans\\" color morph Recently, O. pumilio has been exported from Central America again in small numbers from frog farms. Because of this, they have seen a huge increase in numbers in the dart frog community and are regularly available. = Common color morphs in captivity = One example of a color morph is the blue jeans morph. It is most common throughout the species range, but is relatively rare in the United States pet trade. Most of these animals came from imports during the 1990s, or are their descendants. As of 2003, it was observed that this morph could be found throughout Costa Rica, as well as in mainland Panama.

The First Hungarian Republic was founded by Mihály Károlyi during the Aster Revolution in 1918. In March 1919, the republic was overturned by another revolution, and the Hungarian Soviet Republic (also known as Hungarian Republic of Councils) was created. The unresolved conflicts led to wars between Hungary and its neighbor states (Kingdom of Romania,David Parker, Revolutions and the revolutionary tradition in the West, 1560-1991, Routledge, 2000, p. 170. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and SlovenesPriscilla Mary Roberts, World War I: A Student Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 1824Miklós Lojkó, Meddling in Middle Europe: Britain and the 'Lands Between, 1919-1925, Central European University Press, 2006, p. 13 and the evolving Czechoslovakia) in 1919. The Hungarian Soviet Republic ceased to exist after the Romanian occupation. The Treaty of Trianon in Versailles chilled the conflicts and beneficiaries for this event were Romania, the newly formed states of Czechoslovakia, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Background With the volatile and politically unstable atmosphere of Central Europe in the inter-war years, the establishment of independent governments of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire in November 1918 would see the struggle to regain territories of the former empire. However, the Hungarian President of the Hungarian Democratic Republic, Mihály Károlyi, resigned within four months (on March 20, 1919) in favor of Béla Kun, a pro- Bolshevik who had been sent by Lenin, quickly seizing power and establishing a revolutionary government. Military conflicts During the war, the Hungarian red army fought separate battles against troops from Czechoslovakia and Romania, while France was also highly involved diplomatically in the conflicts, too. By its final stage, more than 120,000 troops on both sides were involved. Appealing to Hungarians with promises of regaining the land lost to neighboring countries within a week of his rise to power, Kun declared war upon Czechoslovakia as Hungarian forces invaded Upper Hungary on May 20, capturing southern territories within weeks. In the face of advancing Hungarian troops, the Allies began to put pressure on the Hungarian government and, within three weeks with Kun's assurances of Russian support failing to materialize, Hungary was forced to withdraw from the just proclaimed Slovak Soviet Republic after given an ultimatum from France, together with a guarantee that Romanian forces would retreat from Tiszántúl. The Romanians disregarded the guarantees of the French leadership and remained on the eastern banks of the Tisza River. The Hungarian government claiming to impose the will of the Allies on Romania, and seeing that diplomatic solutions would not compel them, resolved to clear the threat by military force once and for all. They planned to throw the Romanians out of Tiszántúl, destroy the Romanian army, and even retake Transylvania. However, the Hungarian offensive was defeated by the Romanian army, and despite all previous pledges, agreements, and guarantees, the Romanians crossed the river Tisza and quickly advanced towards Budapest. The Hungarian capital fell on August 4, only three days before Kun's escape to Vienna. The destruction of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the Romanian occupation of parts of Hungary proper, including its capital Budapest in August 1919, ended the war. Romanian troops withdrew from Hungary in March 1920, after seizing large amounts of goods from Hungary, which they regarded as war reparations. Consequences Romanian artillery marching through Budapest Due to the Hungarian–Romanian War, the country was totally defeated. In the name of what they considered to be war reparations, the Romanian government requested the delivery of 50% of the country's rolling stock, 30% of its livestock, twenty thousands carloads of fodder, and even assessed payment for their expenditures. By the beginning of 1920, they had seized much from Hungary, including food, trucks, locomotives and railroad cars, factory equipment, even the telephones and typewriters from the government office.Cecil D. Eby, Hungary at war: civilians and soldiers in World War II, Penn State University Press, 2007, p. 4 The Hungarians regarded the Romanian seizures as looting. The Romanian occupation lasted for nearly six months.Louise Chipley Slavicek, The Treaty of Versailles, Infobase Publishing, 2010, p. 84 After the Romanian occupation, Miklós Horthy's \\"White Terror\\" was carried out in response to the previous \\"Red Terror\\".

A flag protocol defines the proper placement, handling, use, and disposal of flags. Some countries have added certain protocols into their legal system while others prefer to have \\"guidelines\\" without civil or criminal consequences attached. General guidelines General guidelines are accepted practically universally. =On a mast or pole= The flag of honor, which is the nation's flag in most cases, is flown on the center mast if possible. It is also correct to fly the flag on its own right. To an observer it would be on the far left. If more than three flags are used, the proper position is as far left from the point of view of an observer. An additional flag may be placed on the right side, but is not necessary. When two poles are crossed, the position of honor is the flag that ends on the left side from the point of view of an observer (the pole will therefore end on the right). In a semicircle, the position of honor is the center. If a full circle is used outside an entrance to an arena or stadium, the position of honor is directly over the entrance. If used to line the walls of the arena, the flag should be placed directly opposite the entrance. =Hanging= When flown horizontally, as from a flag pole, the flag should be oriented so that the canton is closest to the top of the pole. If hung against a wall, the canton should be placed in the upper-left corner from the point of view of the observer. When hung vertically, flags should be rotated so the canton is again closest to the top of the pole. If the flag is displayed against a wall, the canton should again appear in the upper-left corner, which requires that the flag be both rotated and \\"flipped\\" from its horizontal orientation. =Other places= On a vehicle the flag should be put on a window or affixed securely to the front of the chassis, on the nearside of the vehicle, i.e. the one opposite the driver. (In other words, in countries that drive on the right hand side of the road, a flag is on the right of the vehicle.) On a vehicle where a visiting Head of State or Government is sharing a car with the host Head of State or Government, the host's flag takes the nearside position, the guest's flag on the offside. When placed with a podium or at a place of worship, the flag should hang directly behind or on a pole to the right of the speaker, from the point of view of the flag. When carried in single file, the flag of honor leads. https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian- heritage/services/flag-canada-etiquette/position-honour.html=Multiple flags= When flags of many nations are flown the flag of the hosting country should be placed on the left with the rest following in alphabetical order in the language of the host country. The flag of any sovereign nation should not be displayed over that of another, except when the nations are at war with each other.4 U.S. Code § 7(g) =On a helicopter= Sometimes in a ceremonial flypast, a flag is flown from a weighted rope dangling from beneath a helicopter. By country =Brunei= Members of the royal family and the nobility each have their own flags. The Standard of the Sultan must be flown only over Istana Nurul Iman. Only the Standard of the Sultan, the Crown Prince, the 'Viziers' and 'Cheterias' (royal nobles) will be flown everyday at their respective residents. Other personal royal flags of the Pengirans and personal flags of the non-royal nobles (such as Pehin Manteris) will only be flown during a ceremonial period announced by the Prime Minister's Office such as Sultan's Birthday, Royal Wedding and National Day. The public generally will fly the national flag during these periods. As in many other countries, Bruneians consider it taboo for the flag to touch the ground. =France= When a French vessel meets another French ship, it is to lower and raise its ensign as a greeting. A merchant ship meeting a ship of the French Navy will greet three times. =India= The flag of India has a very distinctive protocol. It is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002; the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Insults to the national flag are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both. Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form. Disposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole and in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag. =Saudi Arabia= Because the flag of Saudi Arabia bears the Shahada, it is never flown at half-mast. =United Kingdom= The Department for Communities and Local Government in November 2012 released the Plain English guide to flying flags for England, a \\"summary of the new, more liberalised, controls over flag flying that were introduced on 12 October 2012\\".gov.uk: \\"Plain English guide to flying flags\\" Nov 2012 In England, the statute governing the flying of flags are The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2007http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/contents/made and 2012.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2372/contents/made =United States= When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. The flag should be to the speaker's right (also described as the flag's own right or audience's left), that is to the left of the podium or pulpit as the speaker is facing the audience. Old guidelines had a distinction whether the flag was at the level of the speaker on a stage or the level of the audience. That distinction has been eliminated and the rule simplified. When the flag is displayed at half-staff, it is customary to raise it briskly to the top the flag pole, then lower it slowly to the half-way mark. This is also done when lowering the flag. The flag is only displayed at half-staff by presidential decree or act of Congress, except on two days: On Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, the flag can be displayed at half-staff until sundown.; on Memorial Day, the flag is flown at half-staff until noon, and then raised to full staff for the remainder of the day. When displaying the US flag, it is customary for it to be above a state's flag when flown on the same pole. When flown separately, a state's flag may be at the same height as the US flag, with the US flag to the left of the state flag, from the perspective of the viewer. When flown with several state flags, the US flag should be at the same height and to the flag's own right (viewer's left), or at the center of and higher than a grouping of state flags. The idea that only the Texas and Hawaii flags—having been the national flags of the Republic of Texas and the Kingdom of Hawaii—may be flown at an equal height to the US flag is a legend. In fact, any other flag may be flown at an equal height to the US flag provided the US flag is at the leftmost staff from the perspective of the viewer. The flag of the United States is used to drape the coffins of deceased veterans of the armed forces. When it is so used, the Union (white stars on blue background) is placed above the deceased's left shoulder. According to United States Code found in Title 4, Chapter 1 pertaining to patriotic customs and observances: These laws were supplemented by executive orders and presidential proclamations. =Uruguay= National flags cannot be adulterated on any way, nor be used with other intention than as national symbols as stated by law. It is also prohibited for buildings to raise flags other than national flags.

It is a protein-rich food that is a staple in Nigeria. In Ghana, it is commonly known as 'Alele' or \\"Olele'. It is usually taken with Hausa koko.  Preparation  Moin-Moin is prepared by first soaking the beans in cold water until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel. Then they are ground or blended (using a blender) until a fine paste is achieved. Salt, bouillon cube, dried crayfish, vegetable oil (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste. Some add sardines, corned beef, sliced boiled eggs, or a combination of these and other 'garnishes' to liven up Moin-Moin. Such is referred to as having 'x' number of lives, 'x' representing the number of garnishes added. The most touted is Moin-Moin elemi meje, which translates to Moin-Moin with seven lives. Moin-Moin usually comes in a slanted pyramid shape or a cylindrical shape, owing to the mold it is poured into prior to cooking. The pyramid shape comes from the traditional broad \\"ewe eran\\" (Thaumatococcus daniellii) or banana leaves fashioned into a cone in one's palm, then the seasoned and garnished liquid is poured into the leaves, which is then folded. The cylindrical shapes come from empty cans of milk or tomato sauce used in preparation of other dishes. Once placed in its mold, it is placed in a large pot about a tenth filled with water. The water is the source of steam that cooks the Moin-Moin. Moin-Moin is eaten alone or with bread as a snack, with rice as a meal or with ogi for breakfast or supper. it can also be taken with garri in the afternoon.

She co-owned the Newark Eagles baseball franchise in the Negro leagues with her husband Abe Manley from 1935 to 1948.Effa Manley Throughout that time, she served as the team's business manager and fulfilled many of her husband's duties as treasurer of the Negro National League. In 2006, she posthumously became the first (and, to date, only) woman inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, chosen by the Special Committee on Negro Leagues for her work as an executive.Effa ManleyEffa Manley Early life Manley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she attended school. In 1916, she graduated from Penn Central High School, completing vocational training there in cooking, oral expression and sewing. She entered the hatmaking business. Manley's racial background is not completely known. Her biological parents may have been white but she was raised by her black stepfather and her mother . The racial background of Manley's mother Bertha (maiden name: Ford) Cole Brooks is contested. Most books say Bertha was German, Effa claimed her maternal grandfather was Native American, but her maternal grandfather was German. Bertha is listed as black on many censuses and documents, however, this could have been due to census takers and biases, no African ancestry has been proven conclusively . Most assumed Manley's stepfather was her biological father and therefore classify her as black. However, according to the book The Most Famous Woman in Baseball by Bob Luke, Effa was born through an extramarital union between her seamstress mother, Bertha Ford Brooks, and Bertha's white employer, Philadelphia stockbroker John Marcus Bishop. Daryl Russell Grigsby wrote, \\"...some insist she was a white woman exposed to black culture, who identified as black. Regardless of her ethnic origins, Effa Manley thought of herself as a black woman and was perceived by all who knew her as just that.\\" Author Ted Schwarz wrote, \\"She was a white woman who passed as a black...She could stay in any hotel she desired.\\" In an interview she gave, she seemed to enjoy the confusion her skin color created. She related a story of when her husband, Abe Manley took her to Tiffany's in New York for an engagement ring. She picked out a huge five-carat stone. She remarked at how every salesgirl in the store was on hand to get a glimpse of this \\"old Negro man buying this young white girl a five-carat ring\\" and how she got a kick out of it. In 1977, Manley was interviewed for an oral history project which is archived at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries. Newark Eagles She married Abe Manley in 1935 after meeting him at a New York Yankees game, and he involved her extensively in the operation of his own club, the Newark Eagles in Newark, New Jersey. She displayed particular skill in the area of marketing and often scheduled promotions that advanced the Civil Rights Movement. Her most noteworthy success was the Eagles' victory in the Negro League World Series in 1946. She worked to improve the condition of the players in the entire league. She advocated better scheduling, pay, and accommodations. Her players traveled in an air-conditioned Flxible Clipper bus, considered extravagant for the Negro leagues. She took over day-to-day business operations of the team, arranged playing schedules, planned the team's travel, managed and met the payroll, bought the equipment, negotiated contracts, and handled publicity and promotions. Thanks to her rallying efforts, more than 185 VIPs—including New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who threw out the first pitch, and Charles C. Lockwood, justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York—were on hand to watch the Eagles' inaugural game in 1935. Among the Eagles players during her ownership were future major league stars such as Larry Doby, who in 1947 was the first player to integrate the American League, Monte Irvin, and Don Newcombe. Manley was critical of Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey, who signed Jackie Robinson to a minor league contract in 1945. She felt Negro league teams were justified in requesting compensation for players who were signed to major league contracts (Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck did pay her $10,000 compensation for Doby's contract, with another $5,000 when he stayed on the Indians roster). Manley was also critical of Negro league fans who supported Rickey because they felt he was integrating the major leagues due to civil rights causes rather than her summation of Rickey seeking business opportunity for his motivation. She also was critical of Robinson when he talked of the disorganization of the Negro leagues, asking him to not forget his beginnings and the contributions the Negro leagues had made to the game. Activism Tribute to Manley at the Baseball Hall of Fame (2014) Her influence extended beyond baseball; she was active in the Civil Rights Movement and a social activist. Before the civil rights movement, Manley supported \\"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\\" boycotts. As part of her work for the Citizens' League for Fair Play, Manley organized a 1934 boycott of stores that refused to hire black salesclerks. After six weeks, the owners of the store (Blumstein's Department Store) gave in, and by the end of 1935 some 300 stores on 125th Street employed black clerks. Manley was the treasurer of the Newark chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and often used Eagles games to promote civic causes. In 1939 she held an \\"Anti-Lynching Day\\" at Ruppert Stadium, selling buttons that read “Stop Lynching” to support efforts to pass federal anti-lynching legislation. During World War II she arranged for entertainers to perform for segregated Black troops stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey when they were barred from segregated USO clubs and canteens. At this time most blacks were barred from practicing medicine. The Booker T. Washington Community Hospital, which offered training for black doctors and nurses, opened due in a large part to money raised from the Newark Eagles. They played numerous benefit games to raise money for new medical equipment. They also raised money for black Elks lodges, a major part of urban black social life. The Eagles worked especially hard for groups that promoted the welfare of Newark's black population. In an exhibit honoring the Negro leagues at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, there is a banner given to the team by the Newark Student Camp Fund in recognition of their efforts to help the community. Another example of the relationship Effa helped forge with the community was copying a practice of another team which allowed the city's youth to attend games for free. Some children could afford the ten-cent fare for the bus ride while others jump on the back of a moving bus to take advantage of the free ballgames. Because of Effa Manley, the Newark Eagles were as important to black Newark as the Dodgers were to Brooklyn. Death By the spring of 1981, her health had deteriorated to the point that she could no longer live in her apartment. She moved into a rest home run by former Negro league player Quincy Trouppe. She told Trouppe that she would go to the hospital to get checked out. She had cancer of the colon, which progressed into peritonitis after surgery. She had a heart attack and died on April 16, 1981, having never returned to the rest home. She died just four days after boxer Joe Louis, her sports idol, who had been one of the most influential black athletes of that time. She was buried in Culver City at the Holy Cross Cemetery. Book Manley and Leon Hardwick wrote Negro Baseball ... Before Integration. In addition to covering the Negro League from 1935 to 1960, parts of the book are autobiographical. Legacy She was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in February 2006. She was the first woman named to the Hall of Fame. In 2010, her life was the subject of a children's book, She Loved Baseball: The Effa Manley Story, written by Audrey Vernick and illustrated by Don Tate.

His song Ilgaz (lyrics also belong to him) has become a household tune in Turkey, and is popular even in China. Early life Bilgen studied and practiced law professionally, but has also been an active musician, particularly in his youth.

He attended Seyfeddin Asal's violin class in Istanbul Municipal Conservatory. While he was a law student, he started playing the violin professionally, first with Istanbul City Orchestra directed by the well known Turkish composer Hasan Ferit Alnar. Later, from 1930 to 1935, he played the first violin with Istanbul Conservatory Orchestra directed by Cemal Reşit Rey, also one of the top Turkish composers of the Republican era. In 1933, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder and President of the Turkish Republic, attended a performance of Bilgen's operetta Othello in Ankara, and expressed his admiration for the work. In 1935, two of his songs won prizes in a composition contest (organized by the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, where Dmitri Shostakovich and Paul Hindemith were among the jury members.

It was also released in Japan on November 25 of the same year, where it was instead distributed by Mumin Corporation. One of the first games written for the platform, it was one of the launch titles that were released along with the system in North America. Set on a futuristic interpretation of Washington, D.C. in the year 2069, players assume the role of the titular robot created by MegaCorp who must infiltrate into the Steel Complex fortress in an attempt of rescuing the President of the United States' first daughter under a time limit from The Criminal Brain, who kidnapped her for a ransom and threats to kill her if his demand is not met. Conceived by Greg Omi, who also developed the Lynx hardware alongside Chip's Challenge creator Chuck Sommerville, Electrocop began its development prior to the existence of any functional Lynx hardware. Electrocop has received mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release, who unanimously praised the pseudo-3D visuals and sound department, but some criticized the repetitive nature of the gameplay and convoluted graphics. A version of the game was developed and completed by ICC for the Atari 7800 but never released.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Electrocop is a third-person shooter game in which players starts off with a countdown clock of one hour to complete the task of rescuing the president's daughter. You have to make your way through different levels coming up against different foes.Electrocop game manual (Atari Lynx, US) These foes are robots that go by, Walker, Python, Mine, Wall Cannon, Virus and Stringray. To get between each level you have to hack through different doors through a computer interface. While in this interface there are directories of Information where you can learn more about the robots, Programs that disable robots and help hack through codes. Games where you can pass the time by playing games of Meteors, Letter Puzzle and Out Break. Along with Med-pack which heals you and weapon repair to help repair your damaged weapons. There are also different weapons to choose from to help you out during the course of the game.  Development and release  Electrocop began development prior to the existence of any functional Atari Lynx hardware. Electrocop was conceived by Greg Omi when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer alongside Chuck Sommerville. In an online interview with website The Atari Times, Omi recounted about the development process of the game, stating that work on the project began before any functional Atari Lynx hardware existed and the team were working on an emulator of the console on the Amiga microcomputer at a slow frame rate, in addition of also using a video camera to scan the image in order to test how the graphics would look like once the hardware was finalized, although an early revision of the Lynx capable of displaying raster graphics was made later during development. Omi also stated that he initially had a lack of knowledge of 3D computer graphics and matrices, as he needed a graphical perspective for his project and consulted Blue Lightning programmer Stephen Landrum in how to write it, as the system could not perform sprite rotation. A long-running rumor was that Electrocop initially started as a 3D sequel to Dennis Caswell's Impossible Mission. However, when asked about this rumor, Omi said \\"it's funny, but I can't remember if it was supposed to be a sequel to Impossible Mission or not. I remember writing a story and basic game design and pitching it to RJ [Mical], but I don't remember if they were asking for a sequel.\\" Despite being a fan of Impossible Mission and knowing Caswell personally, Omi could not recall if he was still a member of Epyx. Atari composer Alex Rudis was also involved during the production of the project and created the music for it. The introductory sequence was created by Sommerville, who developed an animation engine that would be re-used on other titles for the hardware such as Blue Lightning and Todd's Adventures in Slime World, in addition of the minigame sequences. Electrocop was one of the original launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989, along with the aforementioned Blue Lightning, California Games and Gates of Zendocon. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an instruction manual in Japanese. The game was first showcased to the public during the International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989 along with the system, though early previews showed the title under the earlier name Net Runner. = Atari 7800 version = Level artwork from the unreleased Atari 7800 version of Electrocop by Hennig before being transposed to pixel art graphics. A version of Electrocop was in development by ICC for Atari Corporation on the Atari 7800, focusing on action and platforming instead of the third-person shooter gameplay style from the original Lynx version and was also showcased during an exhibition at the Consumer Electronics Show in a complete state. The 7800 version is notable for being one of the first titles where director and writer Amy Hennig was involved, creating the artwork using Atari ST and Macintosh computers as a freelancer. However, despite Hennig stating that work on the project was completed, this version would never be released due to Atari cancelling its release late during the official life span of the system. In a 2007 forum post at AtariAge, former MicroProse UK employee Steve Goss revealed artwork of the cancelled conversion that was given to him by Hennig herself.  Reception  Electrocop garnered mixed reception. In a capsule review for STart, Clayton Walnum praised the game's graphics and variety of challenges. Robert A. Jung reviewed the game which was published to IGN Entertainment. In his final verdict he wrote \\"This cart was a brilliant concept that didn't completely click; the race against the clock and the real-time exploration/combat elements are hampered with uninspired gameplay and little variety. Electrocop's stunning visuals and sounds make it fun to watch, but whether you'd buy a game for its razzle-dazzle is a personal decision.\\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.  Legacy  In recent years, Greg Omi has stated that no sequel was ever planned to be in development. In 1993, Atari Corp. requested several Epyx titles in order to be converted and release to the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar, with Electrocop among the list of selected titles, although no actual development on a Jaguar version was ever started.

Several newer editions have been published.  Setting  Dark Conspiracy is set in the United States of the early 21st century after a \\"Greater Depression\\" has destroyed the global economy and left many countries isolated and bankrupt. Many American cities have expanded to form massive metroplexes, in some cases covering entire states. Outside of the metroplexes the majority of the country has become known as \\"Out-Law\\" where there is virtually no federal or state protection and the road network joining metroplexes is poorly maintained. Scattered throughout the Out-Law and even in the darker and more forbidding areas of the Metroplexes, zones known as \\"Demonground\\" are spawning mysterious \\"dark minions\\": monsters armed with deadly weapons. Players typically assume the roles of \\"Minion Hunters\\", people who have stumbled across this \\"Dark Incursion\\" and have taken up arms against it. Publication history =First edition= Game designer Lester Smith created Dark Conspiracy, a near-future game of dark horror, which was subsequently published as a 366-page softcover book by GDW using a rules system derived from Twilight: 2000. Seventeen artists contributed artwork, including Larry Elmore (cover art), Earl Geier, Tim Bradstreet, Janet Aulisio and Elizabeth Danforth. The following year, a trilogy of Dark Conspiracy novels by Michael Stackpole was published. The first edition also had numerous expansion volumes such as Empathic Sourcebook, Dark Races I, Protodimensions, PC Booster Kit, and Darktek; as well as several adventure modules, and a boardgame. The first edition was also well-supported in GDW's own gaming magazine Challenge, and occasionally in several other gaming publications such as Dragon and White Wolf. The UK magazine Role Player Independent also carried several articles about the first edition game. The first edition uses the same skill-based rule system as Twilight 2000, using a d10 based system for determining success at skill use. Character creation is achieved through a multi-step process in which the player selects various career terms for their character. Each career term specifies either a pre- determined set of skills that the character gained, or allows a certain number of points to be distributed among a set skill list. Each skill is governed by an attribute, either randomly rolled or set using a point distribution method. Each career term also grants the character a fixed number of contacts. As a limit to the number of terms a character can take, each term ages the character four years. Once a certain age limit is reached, the player has to make rolls to prevent the loss of physically oriented attributes due to aging. The rules also include an expansive illustrated list of equipment for use in the characters' fight, and pictures of many of the items, weapons and vehicles mentioned. Game designer Lester Smith explained, \\"Some people want lots; others want little... [P]eople that don’t want them can ignore them, but people who do want them will be glad they’re there. It doesn’t work the other way ‘round... As a role-player myself, I want to be able to see what something looks like, if my character is going to be carrying it. I hate picking something for its stats and having no idea of what it looks like.\\" =Second edition= The Dark Conspiracy product line was discontinued in 1993 due to the declining customer interest. When GDW went out of business in 1995, Dark Conspiracy Enterprises picked up the rights to Dark Conspiracy and later licensed a second edition to Dynasty Presentations. This was published in 1997 as two folio-sized volumes, a book for players, and a book for gamemasters. Both books were published as shorter \\"Basic\\" editions and long \\"Master\\" editions. The second edition used the d20 based system under the Open Game License (OGL). =Third edition= Dark Conspiracy Enterprises licensed The Gamers' Conglomerate to publish a third edition, but this did not happen. In 2010, the option for a third edition was granted to Kinstaff Media. Kinstaff created a division called 3 Hombres Games, which published the PDF of a third edition in 2012 that uses a new rules system with revised character generation and combat rules. A supplement titled Conspiracy Rules and other material were under development when 3 Hombres Games went out of business.

Its long and very complete rules offer much value to players who want a fair shot (or multiple autofire shots) against the monsters. This game is a giant step forward for GDW in size, presentation, and imagination.\\"\\" In a 1996 reader poll by Arcane magazine of readers to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Dark Conspiracy was ranked 43rd. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"Players take on the roles of people who have learnt of the evil forces at work in the world, and are struggling to defeat them. The evil forces have infiltrated what remains of the government and powerful corporations. A great blend of cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu and conspiracy paranoia.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #29 (Oct./Nov., 1991) *Shadis #52 (Oct., 1998)  References  External links *Dark Conspiracy fan website and forum *Demonground Magazine website *Protodimension Magazine archive *Far Future Enterprises website *Dark Conspiracy at Clockwork Publishing Science fiction role-playing games Horror role- playing games Game Designers' Workshop games Role-playing games introduced in 1991 ","title":"Dark Conspiracy"},{"id":"4030626","text":"Heceta Head Light is a lighthouse on the Oregon Coast 13 miles (21 km) north of Florence, and 13 miles (21 km) south of Yachats in the United States. It is located at Heceta Head Lighthouse State Scenic Viewpoint, a state park, midway up a 205-foot-tall (62 m) headland. Built in 1894, the 56-foot (17 m)-tall lighthouse shines a beam visible for 21 nautical miles (39 km; 24 mi), making it the strongest light on the Oregon Coast. The light is maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD), while the assistant lighthouse keepers' house, operated as a bed-and-breakfast inn, is maintained by the U.S. Forest Service. The lighthouse is from Sea Lion Caves. History and construction Closeup view of the Heceta Head Light tower Heceta Head is named after the Spanish explorer Bruno de Heceta, who explored the Pacific Northwest during the late 18th century. Before him, Heceta Head was a spot of frequent fishing and hunting by the American Indian tribes that populated the area. Heceta Head is part of the Siuslaw Indians' traditional lands, known in their language as ɫtúwɪs.Harrington, John Peabody. 1942.

Coos notes. University of Washington, Seattle WAFrachtenberg, Leo. 1913. Coos Texts. Columbia University, Contributions of Anthropology, No. 1, New York In 1888, white settlers moved into the area and claimed of the surrounding land. That same year, the United States Lighthouse Service approved the building of the lighthouse, and the government bought , out of the previously purchased, for the lighthouse structures. In 1892, a crew of 56 began construction the light. Because of the site's seclusion, building materials were either shipped in if the weather and tide permitted, or brought from Florence by wagon, the latter usually taking four or five hours. Stones were brought from the Clackamas River and bricks came from San Francisco. The lens system was made by Chance Brothers. Completed in August 1893, the entire project cost $80,000 and consisted of: *The lighthouse *Houses for the head lightkeeper, the two assistant lightkeepers and their families *A barn *Two kerosene oil storage buildings — if one had caught fire, there was a secondary source Heceta Head Light and Keepers Quarters was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 for its architectural and engineering significance. The site originally included several other buildings — farm buildings and the single- family head lighthouse keeper's house, which was demolished in 1940, and was very similar in size and design to the remaining house. Due to electrification, the head lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the house was bought for $10 and dismantled for its lumber, which was used to build Alpha Bit bookstore-cafe in Mapleton, still standing today. The remaining keepers' house was a duplex that housed the first and second assistant lighthouse keepers and their families. After the light was automated in 1963, the last keepers moved away, and the remaining house was leased to Lane Community College in 1970 by the U.S. Forest Service, which had taken over management of the building. The porch of the Queen Anne-style house underwent restoration in 1981. Restoring the lighthouse, February 2012 The Heceta Head Lighthouse closed to the public in August 2011 for restoration and repairs. Under the supervision of OPRD preservation architect Sue Licht, a team of more than 100 subcontractors and craftsmen, the majority of whom were from Oregon, removed cement stucco that had sealed in moisture so that the lighthouse could air out in the damp coastal environment. They also replaced and restored the tower's historic metalwork and masonry, installed new windows, and repaired the lens rotating mechanism. The interior and exterior of the lighthouse were repainted and the original wood floor of the workroom was uncovered and reconditioned. The lighthouse has been returned as much as possible to the way it would have looked in 1894. It was open again after two years on June 8, 2013, when the OPRD welcomed a group of nearly 100 supporters to Heceta Head State Scenic Viewpoint to celebrate the reopening.

Playing career Hodgkinson signed for Sheffield United from Worksop Town on 1 August 1953, and made 675 first-team appearances (576 in the league) for the Blades between 1953 and 1971, his first being a friendly game against Clyde on 6 April 1954. Hodgkinson made his league début in Division One in a 2–1 away victory against Newcastle United on 28 August 1954 but, despite showing his undoubted potential, the presence of number one goalkeeper Ted Burgin until 1957 and National Service limited his opportunities for the first team. The arrival of Joe Mercer as manager established Hodgkinson's place as first-choice goalkeeper in the side behind the defensive line of Cec Coldwell, Graham Shaw, Brian Richardson, Joe Shaw and Gerry Summers. In 1966–67, he won the Sheffield United Supporters player of the year award. His brilliance and reliability made sure of his place until the signing of John Hope in 1971. His final appearance was, like his first, in a friendly, on 23 January 1971 against Chesterfield. Hodgkinson was also an England International at full and under-23 levels, making his debut for both during the 1956–57 season. His first full England cap came against Scotland in 1957 and he also played against Denmark, and Republic of Ireland (twice in World Cup qualifying games). He was in England's squad for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden but did not feature in any of their games. Two years after his final cap, he returned to the England squad for the 1962 World Cup in Chile as backup to Ron Springett, but once again was not selected for any of the matches. Coaching career Hodgkinson moved on to professional coaching and worked at numerous clubs, including Rangers, Everton, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Sheffield Wednesday, Gillingham, Oldham Athletic, and Birmingham City, and is credited with bringing Peter Schmeichel to Manchester United. Hodgkinson worked at United for seven years before becoming Scotland goalkeeping coach, where he tutored players such as Jim Leighton and Andy Goram. He also had a spell as a youth goalkeeping coach at Rangers and Watford. After a spell with Coventry City, Hodgkinson moved to Rushden & Diamonds and worked with goalkeeper Billy Turley, who then later joined Hodgkinson when he moved to Oxford United. Turley left Oxford in 2010 but Hodgkinson remained to coach first-team keeper Ryan Clarke and later also Max Crocombe. Hodgkinson's retirement from football, at the age of 76, was announced in August 2012. Managing career Hodgkinson spent six years as assistant manager of Gillingham between 1975 and 1981, working as assistant to Gerry Summers, with whom he played at Sheffield United. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.

Gangaur is colourful and one of the most important festivals of people of Rajasthan and is observed throughout the state with great fervour and devotion by womenfolk who worship Gauri, the wife of Lord Shiva during March–April. It is the celebration of spring, harvest, marital fidelity and child bearing.. Gana is a synonym for Lord Shiva and Gaur which stands for Gauri or Parvati who symbolizes Saubhagya (marital bliss). The unmarried women worship her for being blessed with a good husband, while married women do so for the welfare, health and long life of their husbands and for a happy married life. People from Rajasthan when migrated to Kolkata in West Bengal started celebrating Gangaur. This celebration is now more than 100 years old in Kolkata. The 2018 date for the festival is 20 March.http://www.festivalsdatetime.co.in/2016/05/2018-gangaur- hindu-festival-date-time-in-india.html#axzz57fcGnpvP Rites and Rituals The festival commences on the first day of chaitra, the day following Holi and continues for 16 days. For a newly-wedded girl, it is binding to observe the full course of 18 days of the festival that succeeds her marriage. Even unmarried girls fast for the full period of the 18 days and eat only one meal a day. Festivity consummates on 3rd day of Shukla paksha of Chaitra Month. Fairs (Gangaur Melas) are held throughout the 18-day period. Numerous folklores are associated with Gangaur which makes this festival deeply ingrained into the hearts of Rajasthan, and parts of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana & Gujarat. Images and Paintings Images of Isar and [Parvati|Gauri are made of clay for the festival. In some Rajput families, permanent wooden images are painted afresh every year by reputed painters called matherans on the eve of festival. A distinct difference between the idols of Teej and Gangaur is that the Idol will have a canopy during the Teej Festival while the Gangaur idol would not have a canopy. Mehandi The ladies decorate their hands and feet by drawing designs with Mehndi (myrtle paste). The figures drawn range from the Sun, Moon and the starts to simple flowers or geometrical designs. Ghudlias are earthen pots with numerous holes all around and a lamp lit inside them. On the evening of the 7th day after Holi, unmarried girls go around singing songs of ghudlia carrying the pots with a burning lamp inside, on their heads. On their way, they collect small presents of cash, sweets, jaggery, ghee, oil etc. this continues for 10 days i.e. up to the conclusion of the Gangaur festival when the girls break their pots and throw the debris into the well or a tank and enjoys a feast with the collection made.  Vrat katha  Once upon a time, Lord Shiv, along Goddess Parvati and Narad Muni went out to take a small trip. When they reached a nearby forest, the news of their arrival spread like wild fire. As the women were busy preparing a gorgeous spread for the Gods and Goddess, the women of the low class came with their offerings. Lord Shiv and Goddess Parvati happily ate the food and Goddess sprinkled the \\"suhagras\\" on them. After a certain time, the women of the high classes came with the food they had prepared. When they had finished eating Lord Shiv asked his wife that with what was she going to bless the women as she had already finished every bit of the \\"suhagras\\" on blessing the women of lower classes. To this, Goddess Parvati replied that she intended to bless these women with her own blood. Saying so, she scratched the tip of her finger and sprinkled the blood on these women. Gauri's Departure The festival reaches its climax during the last three days. The images of Gauri and Isar are dressed in new garments especially made for the occasion. Unmarried girls and married women decorate the images and make them look like living figures. At an auspicious hour in the afternoon, a procession is taken out to a garden, bawdi or johad or well with the images of Isar and Gauri, placed on the heads of married women. Songs are sung about the departure of Gauri to her husband's house. The procession comes back after offering water to the first two days. On the final day, she faces in the same direction as Isar and the procession concludes in the consignment of the all images in the waters of a tank or a well. The women bid farewell to Gauri and turn their eyes and the Gangaur festival comes to an end.

The park is located on the north side of South King Street between 6th and Maynard avenues, east of Union Station and the Historic Chinatown Gate. It was built in 1973 and includes a pavilion, community games, and two gateways. The park is a noncontributing property within the Seattle Chinatown Historic District described in 1986. Both are within the Seattle Chinatown International District established by City Ordinance 119297 in 1988. Features and events After its expansion, the park occupies the south half-block north of S. King Street, between 6th Avenue S. (on the west) and Maynard Avenue S. (on the east). The original portion of the park occupies the quarter block at the corner of S. King Street and Maynard Avenue S. The original park has an authentic pavilion in the center, along with benches and chess tables. Placed on a diagonal in the southeast corner is a small hanging bulletin board with its own tiled roof. One side contains an outdated map of the district and the other is for community news. Its placement is according to principles of feng shui. Parallel placement would have blocked the qi from flowing into the businesses on the opposite side of the street. There is a large mural dominated by a dragon and featuring scenes of railroad construction, the Kingdome, and the King Street Station clock tower on the wall of the neighboring Bush-Asia Center, painted by John Woo in 1977. In addition, the park features a memorial cenotaph for ten Chinese-American veterans who were killed during World War II. The local American Legion Cathay Post No. 186 holds an annual Memorial Day ceremony there. Tai chi classes and free music are presented in the summer. The annual Dragon Fest also centers on Hing Hay Park. History Aerial view of the block containing what would become Hing Hay Park (1969), facing northeast. The tall E-shaped Bush Hotel is on the northeast corner; the three small buildings that would be demolished to clear the land for Hing Hay Park are in the southeast corner, and the post office (demolished decades later to expand the park) is in the southwest corner. Funds to purchase the buildings and land at the corner of Maynard and King were made available by the Forward Thrust bond initiative, approved by voters in 1968. During the planning phase, the proposed park was generically named the International District Mini Park. The original park space was designed by the landscape architecture firm of Sakuma, James, and Peterson, led by S.K. Sakuma; the land was previously occupied by the Specie Bank of Seattle, built in 1911, and the park, originally , was completed in 1973. The pavilion and furniture were donated by the then Mayor of Taipei after a visit to Seattle in the early 1970s. He met with then King County Council member Ruby Chow, who explained to him that the city had purchased and torn down the condemned buildings on the land, proposing a park instead, but it needed to be as care free as possible because the city could not afford on going maintenance costs. After discussions with Ruby Chow, the mayor of Taipei offered to donate the brickwork, pavilion and bulletin board from his own private funds. He sent over a crew of trained workers to aid in its construction; the pavilion was completed in 1975. Bush Hotel and expanded Hing Hay Park (March 2018) =Expansion= Using funds from a voter-passed parks levy, the city Parks Department purchased the former post office on the west side of the existing park in 2007, intending to demolish it to nearly double the size of Hing Hay Park, adding . The landmark feature of the design proposal was an artistic gateway for the new entrance on the southwest corner of the expanded park. Other features of the new design included seating, landscaping inspired by terraced rice paddies, and performance spaces (including the landmark gateway). The Friends of Hing Hay Park, formed in 2012, met regularly with the internationally known design team of SvR (from Seattle) and Turenscape (based in Beijing). Construction of the expansion project began on January 6, 2016 shortly after the contract was awarded to WS Contractors; the old post office was demolished by February. The Hing Hay Park Expansion opened on June 29, 2017. Although the park was largely complete by April, the artistic gateway and light poles caused the park's opening to be delayed. The large artistic gateway, constructed of perforated red metal and measuring , was designed and fabricated offsite by StudioFifty50. It was installed in February 2018. A celebration was held on March 24, 2018 to mark the completion of the expansion project.

During the bridge, Frusciante plays sparsely in a reggae style, only strumming on the up-beat. Following the bridge, Frusciante utilizes a fuzz (Big Muff Pi by Electro Harmonix) in his solo. He also makes extensive use of a tone-bend.Can't Stop Guitar Commentary; John Frusciante Lyrically, \\"Can't Stop\\" is a prime example of the band's occasional use of writing lyrics to an established rhythm, rather than rhythms to established lyrics.Spin Magazine Interview. August 13, 2002. Kiedis writes in his typical circumlocutory style. Nonetheless, the predominant theme of cultivating an inner, personal energy (evidenced in the title and the final line: \\"This life is more than just a read-through.\\") can be understood in almost every line. The verses are addressed to the listener (or perhaps to himself), in an instructional tone, with references to Kiedis's own life, as well as citing the inspiration of Defunkt (\\"Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for\\") and Julia Butterfly Hill (\\"J. Butterfly is in the treetops\\"). The bridge marks a slight departure, as Kiedis suggests he had temporarily forgotten this philosophy, and looks to a new girlfriend to help himself back on his feet.  Music video  The Mark Romanek-directed music video for the single features all four of the band members doing seemingly random and excessively abstract actions such as holding many water bottles or attempting to balance buckets on their heads. It begins with the camera swooping through a yellow tube to Anthony Kiedis, wearing glasses, and is subsequently followed by the foursome running through a hall with light fixtures attached to their backs. The band engages in various activities, such as wearing a giant purple hippopotamus mask, playing with rubber balls, jumping, abstract scenes with boxes, buckets, water bottles, trash cans, flying through the air, pink foam peanuts, plants, playing guitar in a room full of empty blue chairs/room with lamps turning on and off. At certain segments of the video, one can see guitarist John Frusciante playing an orange Toronado and a silver Fender Stratocaster,https://www.groundguitar.com/john-frusciante-gear/john- frusciantes-1999-fender-custom-shop-silver-sparkle-stratocaster-cant-stop- music-video/ which is unlike his style due to the fact that he only plays vintage guitars (both guitars being under five years of age). Frusciante later explained he was instructed to play the guitars by director Mark Romanek since they blended well with the color scheme used in the video; he also noted that he was never actually playing the guitars.The Making of Can't Stop: The Video – Red Hot Chili Peppers Greatest Hits Inspiration for the video was attributed to Austrian artist Erwin Wurm, as indicated by the sign at the end of the video.Red Hot Chili Peppers 'Can't Stop' video; interview with Director of Photography, Jeff Cuttler. . The lighting was positioned in order to provide a clean-cut, contemporary atmosphere which would integrate with the video's concept. Orange was chosen to be the backsplash color by Romanek. His creative hand attempted to mirror Wurm's abstract \\"One Minute Sculptures\\", by having the band perform random scenes, which seem to fit no purpose. However, in retrospect, they were not intended to be anything more than arbitrary actions, fitting with the ideas expressed in Wurm's work.  Reception and chart performance  The song itself is distinct, especially when in comparison to the various other tracks on By the Way. Some consider the song to be among the only true punk/funk sounds on the entire album, along with \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". Rolling Stone Magazine; By the Way Review – Tom MoonPopMatters; By the Way Review – Kimberly Mack \\"Can't Stop\\" was considered to be \\"energetic\\" and melodically encompassing, by combining textured, melodic, and funky themes together into one. The song was the Chili Peppers' seventh number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and second from the album By the Way. It also peaked at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. Regardless of the moderate recognition it received on the Billboard Hot 100, the song is a live performance staple.

From 1589 he was the owner of the ground lease of the Theatre. Best known for his central role in the construction of the Globe Theatre, he was for four decades a significant agent in the success and endurance of Shakespeare's company, the King's Men. Family The Burbage family is now thought to have come to London from Bromley in Kent. Cuthbert Burbage, baptized 15 June 1565 at St. Stephen Coleman Street near the London Guildhall, was the elder of the two surviving sons of James Burbage (c.1531–1597) and Ellen Brayne (c.1542–1613), the daughter of Thomas Brayne (d.1562), a London tailor, and his wife, Alice Barlow (d.1566). His younger brother was the renowned actor, Richard Burbage. He had two sisters, Ellen (baptized 13 June 1574, buried 13 December 1596) and Alice (baptized 11 March 1576). The Theatre in Shoreditch Burbage's father found employment for him with Sir Walter Cope, a second cousin of Lady Burghley, and gentleman usher to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. According to Wallace, Cuthbert Burbage's position as 'servant' to Cope was likely as a clerk in the Treasury. In June 1586 he reached the age of majority, and joined his father in an ongoing legal dispute over the Theatre in Shoreditch. In August of that year the London grocer John Brayne, his father's brother-in- law, died, allegedly as a result of blows at the hands of his partner in the building of the George Inn in Whitechapel, the London goldsmith, Robert Miles, who was 'tried for murder' at a coroner's inquest. James Burbage and Brayne had originally financed the building of the Theatre in Shoreditch together; it was later claimed that Brayne had bankrupted himself in so doing. However they had no written agreement governing the terms of their partnership, and had earlier fallen out. Brayne, who was childless, had failed to revise his will to leave his interest in the Theatre to James Burbage's children, as he had promised to do, and Burbage had failed to grant Brayne a half interest in the 21-year ground lease which he had signed with Giles Allen on 13 April 1576, and had kept it solely in his own name. On 9 August 1577 an assignment of lease had been drawn up, and on 22 May 1578 Burbage signed a bond in the amount of £400 requiring him to assign a half interest in the ground lease to Brayne, but this was never done. Brayne accused Burbage of double-dealing, and in the following month the partners submitted their dispute to arbitration by two friends, in the course of which Burbage struck Brayne and they fell to fisticuffs. On 12 July 1578 the arbitrators submitted the articles containing their decision, and both Burbage and Brayne signed bonds in the amount of £200 as a guarantee of performance. To further complicate matters, in order to evade his creditors, not only with respect to the Theatre but also in connection with the building of the George Inn with Robert Miles, Brayne signed various deeds of gift of his property, and on 26 September 1579 Burbage borrowed £125 8s 11d from the London grocer John Hyde, in return for which he mortgaged the ground lease of the Theatre for a one-year term. Hyde was not repaid, and the ground lease was forfeited to Hyde on 27 September 1580. Hyde allowed Burbage to continue operating the Theatre and extended the lease, but it was again forfeited to Hyde for non-payment. Hyde had Burbage arrested for debt in June 1582, and tried to put Brayne out as part owner of the Theatre. In the same year, 1582, Edmund Peckham sued Giles Allen over ownership of the ground on which the Theatre stood, and their dispute escalated to the point that, as Cuthbert Burbage later deposed in 1600, his father was forced to hire men to guard the Theatre both day and night. Performances were stopped, and Leicester's Men, who had been playing there, disbanded as a company. James Burbage then became Lord Hunsdon's man, and from 1583 on Hunsdon's Men, known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men from 1585, performed at the Theatre. Thus, at the time of Brayne's death in August 1586, the only legal documents which established that Brayne had had any financial interest in the Theatre were the two bonds which he had managed to get Burbage to sign. James Burbage allowed Brayne's widow, Margaret (née Stowers), a share of the profits for a short time, but then cut her off. At about the same time Hyde, as legal owner of the forfeited ground lease, falsely represented that he had sold his interest to his father-in-law, George Clough, and tried to remove James Burbage from the Theatre and replace him with Clough. In early 1587 Margaret Brayne, with financial backing from Robert Miles, sued James Burbage at common law in an attempt to either recover on the bonds or obtain a half interest in the ground lease and the profits of the Theatre. In the same year the executors of Robert Gardner, to whom Brayne had made one of his deeds of gift, also sued Burbage. In the autumn of 1588 Burbage brought an action of his own against Margaret Brayne in Chancery, and Margaret Brayne then counter-sued in Chancery. The legal battles between Burbage and the widow Brayne continued for a decade, with Burbage always emerging the victor. While these lawsuits were ongoing, both James Burbage and Margaret Brayne sought to obtain an assignment of the ground lease from Hyde. In June 1589 both James and Cuthbert Burbage sought help from Cuthbert's employer, Walter Cope, who accordingly wrote to Hyde suggesting that he, Cope, might be of service to Hyde with the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, on some future occasion if Hyde would assign the ground lease of the Theatre to Cuthbert Burbage. With some reluctance Hyde complied, and on 7 June 1589 assigned his interest in the ground lease of the Theatre to Cuthbert Burbage. According to Wallace, James Burbage continued to manage the Theatre, and business went on much as before, 'but the Theatre itself was Cuthbert's'. Hyde said later that he would not have made the assignment had it not been for Cope's letter. Cuthbert Burbage was equally dissatisfied with the arrangement. He later deposed that he agreed only to save his father from debt, and was of the view that he could have used his influence with Cope to better personal advantage. He was forced to borrow money to pay Hyde, and although the amount is not known with certainty, a statement by Hyde himself indicates that it was almost the entire original debt of £125 8s 11d plus interest. Through his ownership of the ground lease, Cuthbert Burbage was drawn further into the ongoing battles between his father and the widow Brayne. On 4 November 1590 she obtained a court order sequestering the Theatre property until the hearing of the case; however on 13 November Cuthbert succeeded in having that order stayed, and obtained an order for performance of the 1578 arbitration. On 16 November Margaret Brayne, Robert Miles and his son Ralph, and a friend, Nicholas Bishop, took a copy of the order to the Theatre to enforce its terms by taking half the profits from the gallery that day. They arrived just as playgoers were flocking in for a performance. James Burbage, after initial argument through a window of the Theatre, came down into the yard and called Robert Miles a knave and a rascal, and the widow Brayne a 'murdering whore'. James Burbage's wife and her son Richard Burbage, then only about nineteen, came into the yard and beat Robert Miles with a broomstaff. Richard Burbage, after 'scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose', threatened to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with 'great and horrible oaths'. They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, and for the next two or three years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died in late April 1593. In her will dated 8 April she made Robert Miles her sole executor and left him all her property, including her half interest in the Theatre, and he thereby inherited the litigation in which he had already been active as her financial backer. Miles filed a bill of reviver near the end of the year and continued the suit in Chancery until 28 May 1595, when the court finally adjudged that he should attempt to collect on the bonds in the common law courts, which he appears not to have attempted. James Burbage died in February 1597, and two months later the ground lease on the Theatre expired, Giles Allen having refused to renew it. At this point Miles brought an action against Cuthbert Burbage in the Court of Requests, the outcome of which is not known as the relevant documents are no longer extant. The Globe in Southwark Cuthbert Burbage was left to execute the matter of finding the Lord Chamberlain's Men a new home after the lease of the Theatre expired. James Burbage's attempt to bring his company to the Blackfriars Theatre had been stymied by opposition from Blackfriars' wealthy residents; Burbage and company were faced with an imminent crisis. After a last futile attempt to renew the lease, Burbage took action. He leased the Blackfriars to impresario Henry Evans, whose intended use of it for performances by children did not attract opposition. The situation regarding the Theatre was more problematic. The lease, however, gave him the right to use the framing timber of the building, if he did so before the expiration of the lease. When he did not do so, Alleyn announced his intention to use the timber for his own purposes. Looking for a place for his new theatre, Burbage made a verbal agreement with Nicholas Brend for a lease on a stretch of land on Maid Lane in Bankside, near Philip Henslowe's Rose Theatre. Burbage hired Peter Streete to take down the old Theatre and to build the new one from as much of the salvaged material as possible. On the night of 28 December 1598, Cuthbert, Richard, a certain William Smith \\"of Waltham Cross, in the County of Hertford, gentleman\\", Streete, and twelve others took down the Theatre, carried all the wood and timber across the River Thames and built it again there. This new theatre was renamed the Globe. It opened by September 1599. (The Chamberlain's Men, in the interim, appear to have performed at the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch). The Globe provided a stable home for the Chamberlain's Men and their successors, the King's Men, for the next four decades. Cuthbert and his brother had financed the new venue by making five actors (William Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, and William Kempe) as a group, half-sharers in the profits of the house: this arrangement seems to have solidified the structure of the group, helping cement the position of the Chamberlain's Men as the preeminent troupe in London. Together with Richard Robinson and Winifred (d.1642), his wife, William Heminges, Joseph Taylor and John Lowin, Burbage filed a Bill of Complaint on 28 January 1632 in the Court of Requests against the owner of the Globe, Sir Matthew Brend, in order to obtain confirmation of an extension of the 31-year lease originally granted by Sir Matthew Brend's father, Nicholas Brend.. Death Burbage remained one of the keepers of the Globe until his death, aged seventy-one years, in 1636, and the position appears to have been lucrative for him; he lived in a house in a fashionable district, St Giles Cripplegate, and owned another estate in Middlesex.

Early years Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Stein studied under Dale Gutzman \\"Dale Gutzman: Kiss, kiss, bang, bang The founder of Off The Wall Theatre talks about the company's new 'Sweeney Todd'\\" at Whitefish Bay High School, in suburban Milwaukee. Stein appeared in productions of Peer Gynt, Dracula, The Great Sebastians and Gutzman’s own original musical Flash Gordon. Stein also starred in Gutzman’s original musical tragedy The Gods, a multimedia production based on the life of Jean-Gaspard Deburau, the 19th century French mime who performed in pantomime blanche, so called because of the whiteface the artist wore. Stein also competed in high school forensic interpretive poetry reading competitions. Professional career Stein has taught throughout the world at institutions such as the Juilliard School of Drama, and The Institute of Dramatic Arts, Tokyo. He had his own school in Paris for 15 years. In 2007-08, Stein was a Visiting Guest Artist in Dramatic Arts at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. From June 2009 until May 2016, he was the Director of Movement and Physical Theatre for the Brown University/Trinity Rep MFA Program in Providence, Rhode Island. \\"NEW WORKS\\", California Chronicle, February 27, 2009 Since March 2016, Stein has been a senior lecturer SOE and Director of the BFA Actor Training Program in the Department of Theater and Dance at UC Santa Barbara. Stein holds dual American and French citizenship. Performance history His first solo performance, Timepiece, which deals with the passage of time in the life of a man, and how conflict and power, and subsequently, joy and love emerge from time's progression, has been widely viewed as ushering an era of movement performance into corporeal mime. In Timepiece, the objects on stage are translated from their everyday uses into idealistic symbols. A chair, for example, is no longer just to sit on, but rather also an image of support and strength. This performance is visual music with a beginning, middle and end. Barton Wimble of the New York Daily News wrote of Timepiece: \\"Perhaps a handful of times can a critic sit in a theatre and in the space of a mere hour see a performer change the entire course of an established art form, but that is precisely what happened when Daniel Stein opened the Dance Theatre Workshop's 'New Mime Series.'\\" Sylvie Drake of the Los Angeles Times hailed Timepiece as: \\"One of those rare revelatory experiences one waits for in the theatre.\\" Critical attitude Stein has said this about \\"physical theater\\": \\"I think physical theater is much more visceral and audiences are affected much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theater is a live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I know of. Painting, writing, music happen in a mostly interpretive way, which is to say that somebody sits down and writes something and then somebody else interprets it, often in front of a camera. Live theater, where real human beings are standing in front of real human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else that we partake of in our lives. I don’t think we could do it the same way if we were doing literary-based theater.\\" Awards Stein has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States/Japan Commission, the Pew Charitable Trust and has been named a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow.

The program has had 10 to 40 students in each class, which has recently been changed to a max of 30 per class, and the curriculum consists largely of courses related to engineering, science, and high level mathematics. The program is heavy on Advanced Placement (AP) courses, which can provide college credit with appropriate scores(3,4, or 5). A member of the Freehold Regional High School District, the learning center serves an enrollment of no more than 100 students at any time in the school. Applicants, drawn from the communities in the Freehold Regional High School District, take an entrance exam in the eighth grade that tests their abilities in mathematics and English. In addition, there is also a personal statement portion of the application which allows students to write an essay on why they wish to go to the school as well as telling of their extracurricular activities or awards. Parents have been known to move into the district just so their children may have a chance to be accepted into S&E.; The program has an impressive entourage of knowledgeable and helpful teachers. Most students score very highly on standardized tests (the AP, the SAT, the ACT Exam, the PSAT/NMSQT, the High School Proficiency Assessment - HSPA).

But in 1931, he was involved in a \\"rule-bending\\" match against Yorkshire at Sheffield in which, after two rain-ruined days, he and the Yorkshire captain agreed to declare their counties' first innings after one ball had been bowled to bring about a result on the second innings. The rules were changed for the following season to allow for a one-innings match in similar circumstances. Lyon brought Gloucestershire greater success than the county had seen since the days of W. G. Grace. In 1929 and 1930, they won more matches than any other county; in 1930 and 1931, they finished second. Lyon was aided, no doubt, by having Wally Hammond, perhaps England's finest batsman of the time in the side. And the three years of success coincided as well with the last truly effective years of the great slow left-arm bowler Charlie Parker and the first effective years of Parker's successor, the off break bowler Tom Goddard. But the captaincy of Lyon was regarded as a vital factor, and he was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931. The citation in Wisden suggested that he might be a future captain of England, but that did not happen. Lyon's Gloucestershire career began in 1921; he also won a Blue at Oxford in 1922 and 1923. He resigned from the Gloucestershire captaincy after three more moderate years from 1932 to 1934, but played intermittently until 1947. He had also played Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire in 1920. Lyon's older brother, Malcolm Douglas Lyon, known as Dar, played for Cambridge University and Somerset. The brothers were on opposing sides in the 1922 Varsity match. And in 1930, in the match between Somerset and Gloucestershire at Taunton, Dar scored 210 after being dropped twice by Goddard, but Bev replied with a century of his own and led his side to victory by eight wickets.

Two configurations are discussed below, a string resistor ladder and an R–2R ladder. An R–2R ladder is a simple and inexpensive way to perform digital-to-analog conversion, using repetitive arrangements of precise resistor networks in a ladder-like configuration. A string resistor ladder implements the non-repetitive reference network. String resistor ladder network (analog to digital conversion, or ADC) A string of many, often equally dimensioned, resistors connected between two reference voltages is a resistor string ladder network. The resistors act as voltage dividers between the referenced voltages. Each tap of the string generates a different voltage, which can be compared with another voltage: this is the basic principle of a flash ADC (analog-to-digital converter). Often a voltage is converted to a current, enabling the possibility to use an R–2R ladder network. * Disadvantage: for an n-bit ADC, the number of resistors grows exponentially, as 2^n resistors are required, while the R–2R resistor ladder only increases linearly with the number of bits, as it needs only 2n resistors. * Advantage: higher impedance values can be reached using the same number of components. R–2R resistor ladder network (digital to analog conversion) Figure 1: n-bit R–2R resistor ladder A basic R–2R resistor ladder network is shown in Figure 1. Bit an−1 (most significant bit, MSB) through bit a0 (least significant bit, LSB) are driven from digital logic gates. Ideally, the bit inputs are switched between V = 0 (logic 0) and V = Vref (logic 1). The R–2R network causes these digital bits to be weighted in their contribution to the output voltage Vout. Depending on which bits are set to 1 and which to 0, the output voltage (Vout) will have a corresponding stepped value between 0 and Vref minus the value of the minimal step, corresponding to bit 0. The actual value of Vref (and the voltage of logic 0) will depend on the type of technology used to generate the digital signals.Logic Threshold Voltage Levels. For a digital value VAL, of a R–2R DAC with N bits and 0 V/Vref logic levels, the output voltage Vout is: : V_o = V_r \\\\times \\\\tfrac{\\\\text{Value}}{2^N} For example, if N = 5 (hence 2N = 32) and Vref = 3.3 V (typical CMOS logic 1 voltage), then Vout will vary between 0 volts (VAL = 0 = 000002) and the maximum (VAL = 31 = 111112): : V_o = 3.3\\\\,\\\\text{V} \\\\times \\\\tfrac{31}{2^5} = 3.196875\\\\,\\\\text{V} with steps (corresponding to VAL = 1 = 000012) : \\\\Delta V_o = 3.3\\\\,\\\\text{V} \\\\times \\\\tfrac {1}{2^5} = 0.103125\\\\,\\\\text{V} The R–2R ladder is inexpensive and relatively easy to manufacture, since only two resistor values are required (or even one, if R is made by placing a pair of 2R in parallel, or if 2R is made by placing a pair of R in series). It is fast and has fixed output impedance R. The R–2R ladder operates as a string of current dividers, whose output accuracy is solely dependent on how well each resistor is matched to the others. Small inaccuracies in the MSB resistors can entirely overwhelm the contribution of the LSB resistors. This may result in non-monotonic behavior at major crossings, such as from 011112 to 100002. Depending on the type of logic gates used and design of the logic circuits, there may be transitional voltage spikes at such major crossings even with perfect resistor values. These can be filtered with capacitance at the output node (the consequent reduction in bandwidth may be significant in some applications). Finally, the 2R resistance is in series with the digital-output impedance. High-output-impedance gates (e.g., LVDS) may be unsuitable in some cases. For all of the above reasons (and doubtless others), this type of DAC tends to be restricted to a relatively small number of bits; although integrated circuits may push the number of bits to 14 or even more, 8 bits or fewer is more typical. = Accuracy of R–2R resistor ladders = Resistors used with the more significant bits must be proportionally more accurate than those used with the less significant bits; for example, in the R–2R network discussed above, inaccuracies in the bit-4 (MSB) resistors must be insignificant compared to R/32 (i.e., much better than 3%). Further, to avoid problems at the 100002-to-011112 transition, the sum of the inaccuracies in the lower bits must be significantly less than R/32. The required accuracy doubles with each additional bit: for 8 bits, the accuracy required will be better than 1/256 (0.4%). Within integrated circuits, high-accuracy R–2R networks may be printed directly onto a single substrate using thin-film technology, ensuring the resistors share similar electrical characteristics. Even so, they must often be laser-trimmed to achieve the required precision. Such on-chip resistor ladders for digital-to-analog converters achieving 16-bit accuracy have been demonstrated.http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dac161s055.pdf On a printed circuit board, using discrete components, resistors of 1% accuracy would suffice for a 5-bit circuit, however with bit counts beyond this the cost of ever increasing precision resistors becomes prohibitive. For a 10-bit converter, even using 0.1% precision resistors would not guarantee monotonicity of output. This being said, high resolution R-2R ladders formed from discrete components are sometimes used, the nonlinearity being corrected in software. One example of such approach can be seen in the Korad 3005 power supply.  Resistor ladder with unequal rungs  Figure 2: 4-bit linear R–2R DAC using unequal resistors It is not necessary that each \\"rung\\" of the R–2R ladder use the same resistor values. It is only necessary that the \\"2R\\" value matches the sum of the \\"R\\" value plus the Thévenin-equivalent resistance of the lower-significance rungs. Figure 2 shows a linear 4-bit DAC with unequal resistors. This allows a reasonably accurate DAC to be created from a heterogeneous collection of resistors by forming the DAC one bit at a time. At each stage, resistors for the \\"rung\\" and \\"leg\\" are chosen so that the rung value matches the leg value plus the equivalent resistance of the previous rungs. The rung and leg resistors can be formed by pairing other resistors in series or parallel in order to increase the number of available combinations. This process can be automated.

History =Forming Iamonia= Lake Iamonia's base was established during the Early Pleistocene through submergence of land during the various glacial retreats (a warming period) and emergence from the sea during glacial stadial advancement (a cooling period). Though the ice sheet was further north, it affected Iamonia's appearance and significant changes began to take shape during the Okefenokee terrace and shoreline period and was complete by the end of the Wicomico terrace and shoreline event thousands of years later. See: Leon County Pleistocene coastal terraces =Ancient fauna= Lake Iamonia area is known to have supported a variety of megafauna from as far back as 23.6 Ma. Fossils of the bear-dog Amphicyon and the dog-like Temnocyonines have been uncovered at nearby sites. The Griscom Plantation Site, once located on Luna Plantation, and on the south shore of Iamonia has produced fossils of the ruminant Leptomeryx, the horse relatives Merychippus and Parahippus leonensis, and the ancient camel Oxydactylus.

Lake Iamonia is pronounced \\"I-monia\\" and is named after a Seminole town “Hiamonee,” which was located on the banks of the Ochlockonee River. Location The lake is located in the Red Hills Region and is approximately 5,757 acres (23 km2) in size and is long and up to wide. It has a drainage basin of roughly 101 square miles (260 km).Wagner, J. R. and P. E. Musgrove. 1983. Hydrological Assessment of Lake Iamonia and. Iamonia Sink, Leon County.

The flooding of this river re-filled the entire body of the dried lake within 3 days in February 2008. Thunderstorms which hit the Florida panhandle and southwest Georgia on April 2 and 3 brought the level of the Ochlockonee River to , above flood stage raising the lake level substantially. Lake Iamonia at flood stage from Bull Headley Landing on April 3, 2009 =Dams and dikes= In 1910, a dam was constructed across the western end sloughs with two small bridges separated by of fill dirt. The dam separated Lake Iamonia from the Ochlockonee River to keep out the river's water so that the lake would dry for agricultural purposes. In 1940 a long, wide earthen dike was constructed around the sink basin to keep water in the lake. A concrete spillway was constructed for overflow with metal pipes of diameter and sluice gates built into the earthen dikes at the sink. Just before 1950 additional earthen dams were built across Cromartie Arm (to the south) and Strickland Arm (to the north) and bordering Horseshoe Plantation. The purpose of these dams was to keep water in Cromartie and Strickland Arms for the plantations. Cromartie Arm (southeast end) and Strickland arm, northeast end of Lake Iamonia By the 1970s aquatic plants had increased in the lake. In 1978 the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission constructed draw down structures in the sink basin on the north end and under the bridge on N.

West African kaftan/boubou In West Africa, a kaftan or caftan is a pull-over woman's robe. In French, this robe is called a boubou, pronounced boo-boo. The boubou is the traditional female attire in many West African countries including Senegal, Mali and other countries. The boubou can be formal or informal attire.

Today, words such as housecoat and bathrobe (US) or dressing gown (UK) are usually employed instead. Informal fabrics A woman wearing a blouse and skirt set, right. * Batik—created with hot wax and dye. * Fancy print—created by printing patterns on cloth. Unlike expensive wax prints, the design is printed on one side of the cotton fabric. Fancy prints are made in Europe, India, and West Africa. The most popular fancy print is known as the traditional print. * Kente—traditionally woven by men. Kente is an informal fabric for anyone who is not a member of the Akan people. For Akans and many Ewes, kente is a formal cloth. * Mudcloth—created by making mud drawings on cotton. * Tie-dye—made by resist tying cotton then dipping in dye. In Nigeria, tie-dye is known as adire cloth. Formal fabrics * Aso Oke fabric—Woven by men, see Yoruba people. * Cotton brocade—most brocade is produced in Guinea. Brocade is a shiny and polished cotton fabric. * George cloth—George cloth originated in India, where it was used to make saris. The fabric became popular among African royal and noble families. The Ijaw people are known for their George wrappers. * Lace—also known as shain-shain cloth'. * Linen—linen kaftans are a formal style. * Satin—satin fabrics are suitable for formal wear. * African wax prints—traditional cloths in Africa. Most of them are printed in West Africa and China. Some African waxprints are made in the Netherlands, known as Dutch wax. In earlier times these were also produced in Great Britain. In a wax print, the pattern or design is printed on both sides of the cotton fabric. Waxprints are more expensive than fancy prints. Famous manufacturers are Vlisco in the Netherlands, Akosombo Textiles Limited in Ghana and Hitarget in China. Some smaller companies still produce genuine African wax prints. A well known brand is ABC Wax from Manchester, UK. Today ABC Wax is part of Akosombo Textiles Limited and printed in Ghana. There are many companies in Africa and China which use the wax print design for similar looking and much cheaper fancy textiles. Wedding attire A group of women wearing kaftans, also known as boubous, in Senegal, West Africa in 1974. The kaftan is always worn with a headscarf or head tie. During a wedding ceremony, the bride's kaftan is the same color as the groom's dashiki. The traditional color for West African weddings is white. The most popular non-traditional color is purple or lavender, the color of African royalty. Blue, the color of love, is also a common non-traditional color. Most women wear black kaftans to funerals. However, in some parts of Ghana and the United States, some women wear black-and-white prints, or black and red. The kaftan is the most popular attire for women of African descent throughout the African diaspora. African and African-American women wear a wide variety of dresses, and skirt sets made out of formal fabrics as formal wear. However, the kaftan and wrapper are the two traditional choices. It is not uncommon for a woman to wear a white wedding dress when the groom wears African attire. In the United States, African-American women wear the boubou for special occasions. The kaftan or boubou is worn at weddings; funerals; graduations; and Kwanzaa celebrations. The men's robe is also called a boubou, see Senegalese kaftan for further information. Buba A buba (pronounced boo-bah) is a top or blouse. Buba is a Yoruba word that means the upper clothing. For women, the buba is worn with the iro which means wrapper and gele which means head tie. For men, it worn with sokoto which means trousers and fila which means hat. The buba, sokoto/iro and fila/gele set is the traditional costume of the Yoruba people in South Western Nigeria.

Fictional character biography Hauptmann Deutschland is part of a team called the Schutz Heiliggruppe, which was a national superteam protecting Germany. He first appeared in a backup story in Captain America where the Schutz Heiliggruppe captured the Red Skull and abducted him back to Germany in an attempt to put him on trial for war crimes. Although they captured the Skull and subsequently his Skeleton Crew, they later surrendered the Skull to a false Thor, Iron Man and Captain America, who were actually shapeshifting \\"bioplastoid\\" androids created by the Skull's lackey Arnim Zola.Captain America Vol. 1 #393 Realizing the deception, Hauptmann Deutschland followed the Skull back to America. After the obligatory brawl between heroes, he then teamed up with Captain America to track the Skull. They gave up the hunt when confronted with a false corpse of the Red Skull. The false Skull had been shot through the head, and appeared to have been killed by the Scourge of the Underworld, who left his trademark \\"Justice Is Served\\" scrawled on the wall. Captain America Vol. 1 #393 Vormund's next appearance was in a somewhat convoluted tale where he set out with Zeitgeist, another member of the Schutz Heiliggruppe, in order to investigate the slaying of their partner Blitzkrieger, who had himself been slain while investigating the murders of multiple South American local superheroes. Although Vormund was framed for the murders, it was eventually discovered that Zeitgeist was actually a somewhat obscure American villain known as the Everyman. While fleeing Captain America, Zeitgeist tried to stab Vormund with his sword. Vormund redirected the force of Zeitgeist/Everyman's stab and killed him. Captain America Vol. 1 #442 Hauptman Deutschland is later seen aiding Blue Marvel against an organization called The Terror-Hives of W.E.S.P.E.Mighty Avengers Vol. 2 #4 Naming controversy When the issues of Captain America containing Hauptmann Deutschland and the rest of the Schutz Heiliggruppe were to be published in Germany by licensee Condor Interpart, the names of the team were changed in accordance with the German taboos on references to Nazism, despite the team being distinctly anti-Nazi in behavior and the fact that Hauptmann Deutschland's name (literal translation: \\"Captain Germany\\") contains no actual reference to Nazism. In Germany, Hauptmann Deutschland was renamed Freiheitskämpfer (Freedom Fighter). Due to a lack of coordination, when Hauptmann Deutschland next appeared in American comics, he was renamed Vormund, which means \\"legal guardian\\", \\"warden\\" or \\"custodian\\". Per Markus Raymond, a submitter to the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Vormund actually should be used only in reference to a \\"legal guardian for a child or somebody else who can't talk legally for himself\\".. Powers and abilities Hauptmann Deutschland has the power to absorb and redirect kinetic energy. He can project this energy into an opponent, use it to repel attacks, or increase his own strength and endurance. The origin of these powers is unknown. He is also a highly trained soldier and hand-to-hand combatant. He is also known to carry a variety of tactical gadgets in his belt, such as nets, oiled ball bearings, and a cable gun.

The Board of Trade invests in the cultural infrastructure of the area and promotes the construction and maintenance of public venues, including for professional sports, civic meetings, conventions, arts, and cultural events. The organization is composed of membership levels that range from \\"Business Member\\" to \\"Chairman's Council\\". Notable organizations and companies that are currently a part of the Board of Trade include KPMG, Hilton Hotels, The Washington Post, and the Calvert Group. History Before the creation of the Board of Trade, the District of Columbia did not have a cohesive method of organizing and supporting its cultural infrastructure. Therefore, on November 27, 1889, the Greater Washington Board of Trade was founded after the local paper, The Washington Post, ran an advertisement. The board came into existence as a legal entity on December 2, 1889. Known as the Board of Trade for the District of Columbia at the time of its creation, the organization was referred locally to as the Washington Board of Trade. During the 70th annual meeting on October 20, 1959, the organization welcomed its first female members when 188 businesswomen were added to the 7,200 total enrollment. The name of the organization was changed to the Metropolitan Washington Board of Trade. At the 90th annual meeting in 1979, the members approved a name change to the Greater Washington Board of Trade. During that meeting, the Board adopted the logo that is still being used today: three interlocking circles that symbolize the unity of Northern Virginia, the District of Columbia, and suburban Maryland. On November 3, 1992, the Greater Washington Board of Trade challenged the Washington, D.C. law that required employers to provide their at-work employees health insurance to continue to offer the equivalent health insurance coverage for disabled employees who are eligible for workers compensation insurance. On December 14, 1992, the legal decision that the Supreme Court ruled was that states cannot require employers to provide disabled employees the same health insurance with they provide active employees.

Throughout their history, the group's core writers and performers have been Doctor Fun (vocals, saxophones, keyboards, flute, lyrics and songwriting) and Roy Weäsell (electric and acoustic guitars, vocals, keyboards, trombone, roto-vibe, mandolin, lyrics and songwriting). The Weasels have released seven LPs and one EP of original material, along with an early career retrospective compilation, and have played approximately 40 concerts, though they have not performed live since October 2000. They have been compared in reviews to Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention and Steely Dan, based on their melodic jazz and blues based music, elaborate arrangements, deployment of highly regarded session players, open-ended and suspended compositional style, exacting recording standards, and intelligent use of sardonic, sarcastic, historic, political, surrealist and scatological themes in their lyrics. Early history The group was founded after Fun responded to a newspaper advertisement placed by Weäsell and producer-engineer-performer Chris Graf, who were attempting to find a keyboard and saxophone player for a planned live band. For the first several years of their existence, however, the founding trio remained home-bound, writing and recording tracks that would later appear on the discs Meat the Weasels Volume I: Fondue Cabaret and GenerationXcrement. In 1992, The Weasels submitted a tape to the local alternative newsweekly's annual unsigned artists' showcase concert, and were selected as one of four finalists, despite the fact that no live version of the band existed. Fun, Graf and Weäsell quickly assembled and rehearsed a stage presentation of their material, and won generally positive audience and critical reviews for their performance, despite losing the contest to a defunct industrial metal band. Meat the Weasels Volume 1: Fondue Cabaret Inspired by the response to their first live performance, the expanded band polished their basement tapes and released Meat the Weasels: Volume 1, Fondue Cabaret in 1993. The album’s opening cut, “Let the Killing Begin,” is the first in a series of Weasels songs about notorious killers, in this case Henry Lee Lucas. It incorporates a tongue-in-cheek adaptation of the closing soliloquy from the Doors’ “The End”. In addition to Fun, Weäsell and Graf, the record featured Jon Cohen (bass guitar and slide whistle), Rocky Petrocelli (drums) and David Maynard (guitar); Maynard had been a member of the New York Rubber Rock Band, whose 1975 single \\"Disco Lucy\\", was named \\"Worst Single of the Year\\" by Billboard. Following Meat the Weasels' release, the group continued to perform live, though with continued instability in the drummer's seat, which was occupied for various dates by Petrocelli, Jordan Cohen (later of Powerman 5000 and Blue Man Group), Dave King, Doug Klein, Dan Roberts, Steve Scoons, Dave Berger and Steve Candlen; the latter two emerged as drummers of choice for The Weasels' middle recording period. Meat the Weasels Volume I: Fondue Cabaret included the following songs: # “Let the Killing Begin” # “Amway Man” # “Red Meat” # “Might As Well Try You” (Sometimes listed as “Might As Well Try Ewe”) # “Plastic Plant” # “Dancing On Your Grave” # “Have A Nice Day” # “Never Been to Jersey” # “Maybe You’re Dead” # “Put Your Finger in My Brain” # “When the Fat Lady Sings” # “Little Town Ashtray Disaster” Leon’s Mystical Head In 1995, the Weasels undertook their first formal studio experience at New Music Studios in Albany with production and engineering support from Ted Malia, who had also worked with R.E.M., Bobby Brown and others. Maynard, Candlen and Jon Cohen returned to perform with Weäsell, Fun and Graf on the New Music sessions. The initial sessions were creatively fruitful, yet tense; Cohen left the group and was replaced by Alan Okey for subsequent sessions. Leon’s Mystical Head (a title inspired by a Firesign Theatre sketch) featured “Paging Larry Storch,” the first installment of \\"The Larry Trilogy,\\" a series based on the premise that the purest essence of contemporary American comedy was to be found in the film and television work of Larry Fine, Larry Hovis and Larry Storch. The Weasels continued their homages to notorious killers with “A Fish,” about infamous cannibal Albert Fish. After the release of Leon’s Mystical Head, the band's core members decided that all subsequent albums would be recorded and engineered under their own direct supervision, with Graf taking a prominent creative role in the increasingly elaborate productions of Fun and Weäsell's compositions. Live shows from this period occasionally featured “Weasel Vision,” a multimedia visual presentation created by artists Michael Oatman and John J.A. Jannone. In July 2006, \\"Bar-B-Q Baby\\" was selected for regular broadcast on Doctor Demento's internationally syndicated radio show. Leon’s Mystical Head included the following songs: # “Leon’s Mystical Head” # “A Fish” # “Bulldoze the Moon” # “Klaus Barbie and Ken” # “Bang My Head” # “Poor Blind Sheehan” # “Bitch Is All Business” # “Paging Larry Storch” # “Bar-B-Q Baby” # “Murder of Crow” # “Ahab” # “The Short Song” (hidden track) Uranus Or Bust The next Weasels album, Uranus or Bust, took three years to write, record and release. Behind original cover art by Michael Oatman, Fun (billed as Racer Fun), Weäsell (billed as Chairman Wow) and Graf (now Sir Mixalot of Ice-T) offered 16 new compositions (one hidden) produced and engineered at Graf's Big Saucy Sound Studio. Berger, Maynard and Okey returned to the band, and were joined by keyboardist Adrian Cohen, brother of Weasel emeriti Jordan and Jon, the latter of whom guests on Uranus, as do drummers Candlen, Petrocelli and Larry Levine, Amy Abdou (violin), Rena Graf (vocals), Mike Pauley (bass) and “some Russian friend of Candlen’s” (voices). Two of Uranus’ songs were commissioned as part of multimedia art installations created by Oatman. “Hall of Pain” (about this album's representative Notorious Killer, nineteenth-century Troy, New York's Andress Hall) was composed as part of “Awful Disclosures: The Life and Confessions of Andress Hall,” while “Monument Road” appeared in conjunction with “Henry Perkins and the Eugenics Survey of Vermont.” Maynard composed the music for one song on the album, “Dumber Than Me,” while the Larry Trilogy continued with “Ou Est Monsieur Crane?”, which was also performed live by the Clown Punchers, a side project featuring Weäsell and Mike Goudreau, VH1 staff writer for such programs as I Love the '80s and Before They Were Rock Stars. In May 2006, \\"Mr. Yamamoto\\" (a.k.a. \\"Jimmy's Talking Pants\\") was selected for broadcast on Doctor Demento's internationally syndicated radio show. Uranus or Bust included the following songs: # “Harvey Loped Along” # “Something Wicked” # “Onan Spilled His Seed” # “Small Engine Repair” # “MacNeice” # “Alison Wonderbread” # “Ou Est Monsieur Crane?” # “Monument Road” # “Lemons” # “A Million Vacations” # “Dumber Than Me” # “Crogolin Grange” # “Jimmy’s Talking Pants” (sometimes listed as “Mr. Yamamoto”) # “Hale-Bopp (Recorded Live at the Village Gate, NYC, November 23, 1961)” # “Hall of Pain” # “Rachel” (a hidden track) GenerationXcrement Originally conceived as the bonus disc for a planned four-record box set retrospective, GenerationXcrement was released in 2000 and provided an assortment of alternate takes and unreleased tracks from the group's first decade, including some of the earliest “basement tapes” from their pre-live incarnations. On October 28, 2000, the band played what is, to date, their last live show at Valentine's Music Hall in Albany to support this disc's release. Fun and Weäsell were joined onstage by Jon Cohen (bass), drummer Scott Appicelli and hired hands Steve Watson (keyboards) and Nathaniel Ward (guitar). Graf no longer performed onstage with the Weasels, but provided sound mix and supplements from the engineer's booth. GenerationXcrement featured performers from throughout the band's history, including the following musicians not credited elsewhere in their recorded canon: Mike Sheehan (keyboards), Andy Manion (guitar) and Mary Panza (voice). The album included the following songs: # \\"Man On the Moon” # “Fluffy Wuffy Bunnies” # “Billy Boy” # “Let the Killing Begin” # \\"Have A Nice Day” # “Old Spot Old Stain” # “Amway Man” # “Gawdzilla” # “A Fish” # “Fat Lady Sings” # “Part On the Square” (written for an art installation by Oatman, and sometimes listed as \\"Hard On the Square\\") # “Generation Excrement” Axis of Weasel The first release of The Weasels' studio-only era was Axis of Weasel, released in January 2006. Produced and engineered by Graf at Big Saucy Sound, the album's 12 songs feature Fun, Weäsell, Graf, Jon Cohen (bass and Chapman Stick), Adrian Cohen (keyboards), Appicelli (drums), and new guitarist Matt Pirog. Guests on the record include stalwart guitarist Maynard on lead and slide guitars, Rena Graf and Mike Pauley (backing vocals), Dud Hennessey (mouth harp), Nathaniel Ward (guitar) and J. Eric Smith (theremin). Axis of Weasel was originally titled It Takes A Village to Raise a Village Idiot and is referenced as such in news articles and reviews from this period. The Larry Trilogy continued with closing track “Everything’s Fine.” Album opener “Hey Joey Doyle” takes film masterpiece On the Waterfront as its launching point. An edit from “Dirtnap” was broadcast nationally in January 2006 as part of National Public Radio’s “A Word to the Wise” segment, dealing with coffins, caskets and undertakers. Axis of Weasel included the following tracks: # \\"Hey Joey Doyle” # “Where Cheese Is King” # “Flergen, A Swede” # “Suckling” # “Transparent” # “Whither Goest the Waitress” # “1973” # “Officer Gerbils” # \\"Cosmic Rays” # “Under A Cheddar Moon” # “Dirtnap” # “Everything’s Fine” Little Big Man In Spring 2006, a new Weasels song called \\"Little Big Man\\" was featured in \\"Model Citizens\\", an exhibition and series of documentary videos spanning four Northeast communities and featuring the work of over 25 model makers and curated as part of the Public Art/Moving Site Project; the show also involved longtime Weasels collaborator Michael Oatman. \\"Little Big Man\\" featured Fun, Graf, Weäsell and Pirog from the Axis of Weasel band, joined by returning Leon/Uranus bassist Alan Okey and Al Kash, an internationally recognized veteran drummer whose first recordings were with Australian band, Blackfeather on their 1971 album At the Mountains of Madness. Kash also played drums in Florida for Tiger Tiger, a Miccosukee Indian band in the 1970s before returning to the Albany area to form regional '80s new wave legends Fear of Strangers (originally known as the Units), a band that also featured Aimee Mann collaborator Todd Nelson (guitar), with whom Kash later played in the Rumdummies. # \\"Little Big Man\\" AARP Go The Weasels Graf, Pirog and Okey left The Weasels after the completion of \\"Little Big Man,\\" with Jon Cohen returning as bassist. In September 2010, The Weasels released a single and video, \\"Do The Teabag,\\" featuring a new core line-up of Fun (Vocals, keyboards, saxophone), Weäsell (guitar, vocals), Kash (drums) and Jon Cohen (bass). The full-length AARP Go The Weasels was released on February 14, 2013 (Valentine's Day), and included \\"Do The Teabag\\" in its 15-track playlist. Fun, Weasell, Jon Cohen and Kash are joined on the album by guitarists Chuck D’Aloia (Nick Brignola, Happy Rhodes) and Eric Finn, saxophone player Brian Patneaude, vocalist Sarah La Duke, keyboardists Adrian Cohen and Mike Kelley and percussionist Scott Apicelli, who also co-produced the album with Fun and Weäsell. AARP Go The Weasels includes the following tracks: # \\"Father Weasel\\" # \\"A Friend in Tweed\\" # \\"1-800-MORON\\" # \\"Zucchini Park\\" # \\"Do The Teabag\\" # \\"Driving Albert's Brain\\" # \\"What Says Creep\\" (re-make of \\"Billy Boy\\" from Generation Xcrement) # \\"Timmy's in Trouble\\" # \\"Freemason Reese\\" (re-make of \\"Part on the Square\\" from Generation Xcrement) # \\"Last Supper on Lark Street\\" # \\"Invasion of the Body\\" # \\"Trotsky in the Bronx\\" # \\"Drink Your Tea\\" # \\"Wailing Song\\" # \\"Doubting Thomas\\" Also Sprach Larrythustra In May 2015, the Weasels released a five-track EP titled Also Sprach Larrythustra, which continues the group's homage to the Trilogy of Larry by featuring a cover image of Larry Fine as the Egyptian Sphynx. Fun, Weäsell and D'Aloia return from the AARP Go The Weasels band, with session professional and instructional writer Art Bernstein replacing Al Kash on drums. Songs include: # \\"Spin\\" # \\"Ding Ding\\" # \\"Where Is The Polar Bear\\" # \\"Diamond Blue Gremlin\\" # \\"Saffron Nearly\\" The Man Who Saw Tomorrow The Weasels' seventh full-length album, The Man Who Saw Tomorrow, was released in November 2018, featuring a core band of Fun (vocals, keyboards, guitar, jazz flute), Weäsell (guitars, vocals), D'Aloia (lead guitar, bass) and Bernstein (drums), supplemented by guest bassists Charles Berthoud and Baba Elefante, and guest keyboardists Joshua Hegg and Mike Kelley.

Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non- breeder becomes the breeding male. Description A. sandaracinos is one of the smaller anemonefish, which grows up to 11 cm as a female and 3 to 6.5 cm as a male. Its body has a stock appearance, oval shape, compressed laterally and with a round profile. Its coloration is bright orange, with a white stripe on the dorsal ridge from the superior lip, passing between the eyes and ending at the caudal fin base. All the fins have the same coloration as the body except the dorsal fin which is partially white. Its iris is bright yellow. Distribution and habitat A. sandaracinos is found in the center of the Indo-Pacific area, known as the Coral Triangle, from the Philippines to Indonesia and New Guinea.It is also found in north western Australia, Christmas Island, Melanesia and to the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan. A. sandaracinos typically lives in small groups on outer reef slopes or in lagoons at a maximal depth of . =Host anemones= The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure. A. sandaracinos is a specialist, being hosted primarily by 1 out of the 10 host anemones: *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone (rarely) *Stichodactyla mertensii Mertens' carpet sea anemone (usually) On the northern coast of New Guinea, male A. sandaracinos occasionally breed with the significantly larger female A. chrysopterus and their offspring is the hybrid anemonefish A. leucokranos. In 2011 3 individuals of A. sandaracinos and a pair of A. clarkii were observed to coexist within one host anemone of Stichodactyla mertensii. A. clarkii was not aggressive towards the A. sandaracinos but was aggressive towards all fish approaching the anemone. The anemonefish didn't divide the host into separate territories. Feeding Like all anemonefish, A. sandaracinos is omnivorous and its diet is based on zooplankton, small benthic crustaceans and algaes. Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. The other threat to anemonefish is collection for the marine aquarium trade where anemonefish make up 43% of the global marine ornamental trade, and 25% of the global trade comes from fish bred in captivity, while the majority are captured from the wild, accounting for decreased densities in exploited areas. While bleaching is a significant threat to anemonefish and their host anemones, there is evidence suggesting that collection compounds the localised impact of bleaching. A. sandaracinos was the only species of anemonefish that was evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List and it was listed as being of least concern as the threats are mainly of a localised nature and do not pose a significant threat to the global population of this species. In aquaria A. sandaracinos along with their host anemones are collected for the aquarium trade, and the anemonefish has been bred in captivity.

Javad is most remembered for writing the words of the National Anthem of Azerbaijan, which was used during the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan between 1918–1920, and which has been reinstated now that Azerbaijan has regained its freedom, since 1991, and another poem named Çırpınırdı Qaradəniz.  Biography  Ahmad Javad Akhundzade was born on May 5, 1892, in the village Seyfali of Shamkir rayon. He got his primary education at home, learnt Turkish, Persian, Arabic languages and Eastern literature. In 1912, after graduating from religious seminary in Ganja, he worked as a teacher and took part in the literary and socio-political life of the city. During the Balkan war he fought on the side of Turkey in the part of \\"Caucasian detachment of volunteers\\". Being a member of the Charity Society he helped orphans and refugees in Kars, Erzurum and in other cities. In 1916, a collection of Ahmad Javad's poems \\"Goshma\\" and in 1919, \\"Dalga\\" (Wave) were published.The period Ahmad Javad's activity, who was famed as the poet of independence is related to Mammed Amin Rasulzade. On the proposal of Rasulzade, the poet joined the party \\"Musavat\\" . The peak of poet's poetry is related to ADR. Ahmad Javad welcomed the declaration of ADR in the poem \\"Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan!\\". He glorifies three-coloured flag of Azerbaijan in the poem \\"To Azerbaijan's flag\\". After the declaration of ADR the poet continued teaching and helped the minister of ADR-Nasib bey Yusifbeyli in the enlightenment of cultural sphere. He actively took part in the establishment of Azerbaijan University. In the poem \\"O, soldier!\\" he glorified Turkish Army, which came to the aid of Azerbaijani people in 1918. After the establishment of Soviet authority Ahmad Javad continued pedagogical activity. In 1920, he worked as the school headmaster and the teacher of Russian and Azerbaijani languages in the village Khulug of Gusar rayon, but from 1920 to 1922 he was Quba rayon's public education branch's manager. In 1922–1927 he studied in the history and philology department of Azerbaijan's Pedagogic Institute, and simultaneously taught at the technical scholl named after Nariman Narimanov. In 1924–1926 he worked as the senior secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers of Azerbaijan. In 1925, Ahmad Javad was arrested for the poem \\"Goygol\\". In 1930 he moved to Ganja. From 1930 to 1933 he was a teacher, then the associate professor and the head of a chair of Russian and Azerbaijani languages of Ganja Agricultural Institute. In 1933, Ahmad Javad was conferred on the title of professor. Afterwards he headed a literary department of Ganja Drama Theater. In 1934, Ahmad Javad returned to Baku, worked as an editor of translation department of \\"Azernashr\\" Publishing House. In 1935–1936, he headed the department of documentary films at \\"Azerbaijanfilm\\" film studio. In March 1937 Ahmad Javad was awarded the first premium for translation of Shota Rustaveli's \\"The Knight in Tiger Skin\\" into Azerbaijani language. Such works had been translated by Ahmad Javad into Azerbaijani language: A.S.Pushkin's \\"Copper Rider\\", M. Gorky's \\"Childhood\\", I.Turgenev's proses. European works, such as Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\", F. Rabelais's \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel\\", K. Gamsun's \\"Hunger\\". He was later arrested by the Soviet regime and executed on October 13, 1937, accused of trying to infuse the Musavat spirit of nationalism and independence into young Azerbaijani poets.Sharifov, Azad (1998)\\"Reviving the Memory of Silenced Voices, Ahmad Javad - Poet,\\" Azerbaijan International, 6(1), Spring 1998. He became a member of Musavat Party in 1918, and from 1920 to 1923 he was a member of the Central Committee Musavat, for which he was arrested in 1923 and later freed. He was a leader of the Musavat Literature Union called Yashil Galamlar (Green Pens). Ahmad Javad was the victim of Soviet regime of 1937 was one of the many Azerbaijani artists and writers who was imprisoned and killed for having idea that were considered to be dangerous to Soviets. Yellowed official documents vividly recount the tragedy of his case. From the archives of the former Azerbaijan People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs (KGB) come many cases that are absolutely impossible to read without feeling pain in one's heart. Case No. 12493 is the file of Ahmad Javad Akhundzade, poet, public figure, author of numerous esseys, translator of the world’ classic writers – Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Gorky. On the first page of the case document, there is a reference to May 27, 1937, entered by two officials of the Force Department of the State Security Office-Tsinman and Klementsitsem (both of whom were later convicted for beating, torturing and killing many of Azerbaijan's intellectuals. In his case, there is a photo of prisoner Ahmad Javad, number 1112. The last sentence reads: “The death sentence of Ahmad Javad was executed on October 13, 1937, in Baku”. The KGB held that he was the member of the Communist Party as well as the government of Azerbaijan Republic and its counterrevolutionary positions. His family was exiled, too. His wife Shukriya Khanum was questioned in the infamous “ inner jail “ for the first and last time. She separated from her children and sentenced to eight years in a Siberian Labor camp. As many Azerbaijani women – the wives of progressive minded writers and poets, she didn't know why her husband was sentenced to death. Along with Ahmad Javad many other talented literary critics, poets, writers, such as Huseyn Javid, Mikayil Mushfig, Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, Ali Sabri, Khulufly, Hanafi Zeynally, Hajibaba Nazarli, Bekir Chobanzade, Kazym Alekberli and many intelligencia were repressed in their efforts to spread “strange” and “politically harmful” works. In December 1955, Ahmad Javad got rehabilitation. His works, such as \\"Poems\\" (1958), \\"Don't cry, I will do\\" (1991), translations: F. Rabelais's \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel\\" (1961), tragedies: Shakespeare's \\"Otello\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliett (1962), poem: Rustaveli's \\"The Knight in tiger skin\\" (1978). The documents charged that in addition to being a member of the Musavat Party, Ahmad Javad was a friend of M.A.Rasulzade, the founder of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, as well as the poets Mushfig and Javid. Ahmad Javad was a very talented poet who glorified patriotic ideas, ideas of independence in his poetry. He artistically described the beauty of his motherland's nature. {border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\" English Translation Let me explain to those Who ask who I am, I am a voice which belongs to the tormented country The screams \\"Justice!\\" It is true that I am a poet, But I have different wishes, desires!

Law was later excommunicated for apostasy from the church and was founder of the short-lived True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In this capacity, he published a single edition of the Nauvoo Expositor, the destruction of which set in motion a chain of events that eventually led to Smith's death. Biography Law was born in County Tyrone, Ireland, to Richard Law and Ann HunterBiography of William Law, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed August 15, 2013). as the youngest of five children. His older brother was Wilson Law. The Law family moved to the United States around 1820.

In 1839, he led a group of Canadian saints to Nauvoo, Illinois, and in 1841, Joseph Smith chose him to be a member of the First Presidency.Jessee, Dean C., editor The Papers of Joseph Smith Vol. 2, p. 565. As time progressed, Law became troubled by certain practices of Smith. He felt Smith was confusing church and state roles in Nauvoo, by evading extradition to be tried for crimes in Missouri. He also thought Smith used his church authority to sway political outcomes. However, it was Smith's covert practice of polygamy (and his advances towards Law's wife, Jane) that caused Law to completely separate himself. Rumors circulated that Smith had made several proposals to Jane under the premise that she would enter a polyandrous marriage with Smith.\\"Polygamy, Persecution And Power\\", Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 1996, paragraph 16, 17. Law and his wife confirmed these rumors were partly true. However, according to Alexander Neibaur, Jane Law had actually asked to be sealed to Smith after he had refused to seal her to William. According to the rumor, Smith had denied the couple because William was guilty of adultery (William had confessed his actions to Smith), though he did not tell Jane his reasons.Neibaur Journal, May 24, 1844. In committing the sin, Law felt like he had transgressed against his own soul.Neibaur, Journal, May 24, 1844; Council of Fifty, “Record,” [290], in JSP, CFM:192; see also 192, note 596; and Cook, William Law, 25–27, note 84. Years later, according to Ann Eliza Young (nineteenth wife of Brigham Young and later a critic of polygamy and Mormonism), Jane stated Smith visited her at night when he knew Law would not be home and proposed to her, suggesting it was God's will that she enter into a polyandrous marriage with him. \\"Wife no. 19\\", Ann Eliza Young, 1875, p, 61, Young's account states that Jane Law stated that Smith had \\"asked her to give him half her love; she was at liberty to keep the other half for her husband.\\" \\"Wife no. 19\\", Ann Eliza Young, 1875, p, 61, [These allegations from Ann Eliza Young can only be hearsay; Young was not even born until after Joseph Smith's death.] She refused Smith's request to marry him as a polyandrous plural wife. In contrast to her claim, Smith stated Jane had \\"thrown her arms around his neck\\" and requested to be sealed to Smith if she could not be sealed to William Law. Smith turned down the request.Neibaur, Journal, May 24, 1844; Council of Fifty, “Record,” [290], in JSP, CFM:192; see also 192, note 596; and Cook, William Law, 25–27, note 84. Law still believed Mormonism to be true, but he viewed Smith as a fallen prophet. On January 8, 1844, Law was informed that he was no longer a counselor to Smith in the First Presidency. He was shocked and frustrated. He demanded a rehearing of his case, because the procedures for removal from the First Presidency had not been followed. The rehearing was granted and on April 18, 1844, he was tried again. However, this time he was tried as if he were a private member and not a high-ranking church official. Once again he felt this went against church protocol. The following day he was informed of his excommunication on grounds of apostasy. At this point, he felt Smith was beyond saving, and that it was his duty to expose him to the rest of the Mormon community. Law met privately after his excommunication with other opponents of Smith and formed a group. Shortly thereafter, Law created the True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and became its President. On June 7, 1844, Law and his followers published the Nauvoo Expositor, a newspaper that outlined Law's contentions against Smith, including the then- secret practice of plural marriage. The reaction to the newspaper was not what Law expected, and after two days of consultation, the printing press was ordered destroyed by Smith and the Nauvoo city council. It was destroyed later that day. Smith was later arrested and taken to nearby Carthage, Illinois, on charges relating to the destruction of the Expositor.Supplement to the Millennial Star, August 1844 p. 2. (This document can be found online by doing a key word search at http://www.lib.byu.edu/online.html?tab=4) On June 27, 1844, Smith was killed by a mob.Doctrine and Covenants () For many years, Law was accused of being a member or a leader of the mob that killed Smith.An unnamed witness said he saw Law at the jail at the time of the killing: Naked Truths About Mormonism, 1 (April 1888). Willard Richards, who was present with Smith in Carthage Jail at the time of the killing, included Law on his list of murderers of Smith: History of the Church 7:146. It is unknown whether Richards meant that he saw Law in the mob, or whether he merely suspected Law of being a behind-the-scenes organizer. However, Law's diary shows that he was not in Carthage at the time of the murder, though he had been present there earlier in the day.Diary of William Law, 12–13. Although Law expresses outrage and remorse at Smith's death in his private journal, he goes on to say that it was Smith's goal \\"to demoralize the world, to give it to Satan, his master..... He claimed to be a god, whereas he was only a servant of the Devil, and as such he met his fate.\\"Diary of William Law, 13–14. In 1887, Law agreed to be interviewed reflecting on his experience with Mormonism.http://www.mrm.org/law-interview This interview, along with three letters by Law, were published in the Salt Lake Tribune.http://www.mazeministry.com/mormonism/newsletters_articles/newsweek/newsweek/lawint2.htm Law eventually moved to Shullsburg, Lafayette County, Wisconsin, where he died in 1892.

It provides a common interface for submission of computational tasks to different distributed computing systems and thus can enable grid infrastructures of varying size and complexity. The set of services and utilities providing the interface is known as ARC Computing Element (ARC-CE). ARC-CE functionality includes data staging and caching, developed in order to support data-intensive distributed computing. ARC is an open source software distributed under the Apache License 2.0.http://download.nordugrid.org/  History  ARC appeared (and is still often referred to) as the NorduGrid middleware, originally proposed as an architecture on top of the Globus Toolkit optimized for the needs of High-Energy Physics computing for the Large Hadron Collider experiments. First deployment of ARC at the NorduGrid testbed took place in summer 2002, and by 2003 it was used to support complex computations. The first stable release of ARC (version 0.4) came out in April 2004 under the GNU General Public License.ARC 0.4 Release Notes The name \\"Advanced Resource Connector\\" was introduced for this release to distinguish the middleware from the infrastructure. In the same year, the Swedish national Grid project Swegrid became the first large cross-discipline infrastructure to be based on ARC. In 2005, NorduGrid was formally established as a collaboration to support and coordinate ARC development.NorduGrid Web site In 2006 two closely related projects were launched: the Nordic Data Grid Facility, deploying a pan-Nordic e-Science infrastructure based on ARC, and KnowARC, focused on transforming ARC into a next generation Grid middleware. ARC v0.6 was released in May 2007, becoming the second stable release.ARC 0.6 Release Notes Its key feature was introduction of the client library enabling easy development of higher-level applications. It was also the first ARC release making use of open standards, as it included support for JSDL. Later that year, the first technology preview of the next generation ARC middleware was made available, though was not distributed with ARC itself. The new approach involved switching to a Web service based architecture, and in general a very substantial re-factorisation of the core code. In 2008, the NorduGrid consortium adopted the Apache License for all ARC components. The last stable release in the 0-line was ARC v0.8, shipped in September 2009.ARC 0.8 Release Notes It eventually included a preview version of the new execution service - the A-REX' - and several other components, like Chelonia, ISIS, Charon' and the arcjobtool GUI. In parallel to ARC v0.8, the EU KnowARC project released in November 2009 the conceptual ARC NOX suite, which was a complete Grid solution, fully based on Web service technologies.ARC NOX Release Notes The name NOX actually indicates the release date: November of the Year of the Ox. In May 2011, NorduGrid released ARC v11.05 (adopting Ubuntu versioning scheme this time). This release marked the complete transition from the old execution service to A-REX and accompanying services. For backwards compatibility with the existing infrastructures, old interfaces for the execution service and the information system were retained. ARC 6 was released in May 2019ARC 6 Release Notes and while having same interfaces it features a completely redesigned configuration and a new management tool. Components * Hosting environment: ** HED - hosting environment for Web services (WS) * Execution services: ** Grid Manager - server providing computing capability ** A-REX - next generation of Grid Manager, WS-based * Information services: ** Classic information server - local service information publishing ** Classic information index - distributed information indexing * Accounting: ** JURA - job record publisher for A-REX * Clients: ** arc* job and data CLI - next generation command-line interface for job and data management, interoperable with other middlewares like gLite and UNICORE ** arcproxy - universal Grid proxy generation utility ** Grid Monitor - graphical interface to the classic information services * Libraries and API: ** libarcclient - job management and information ** libarcdata2 - data management ** HED security API Availability ARC is free software available from the NorduGrid public repository, both as binary packages for a variety of Linux systems and source. Source code is also openly available from the NorduGrid SVN repository. Development The open source development of the ARC middleware is coordinated by the NorduGrid collaboration. Contributions to the software, documentation and dissemination activities are coming from the community and from various projects, such as the EU KnowARC and EMI projects, NDGF, NeIC and various national infrastructure and research projects. Versioning Between 2011 and 2018 ARC used an Ubuntu-like versioning schema for bundled releases consisting of individual components. Individual components have own versioning, corresponding to code tags.ARC releases table Version of the core ARC packages is often used instead of the formal release number in everyday communication. Starting with ARC6 (2019) version number of the release coincides with that of the tag. Standards and interoperability ARC implements several Open Grid Forum standards, in particular, JSDL, Glue2, BES, UR/RUS and StAR.  ARC in various projects and initiatives  = European Middleware Initiative = In 2010-2013, several key ARC components - most notably, HED, A-REX, clients and libraries - were included in the European Middleware Initiative (EMI) software stack. Through EMI, ARC became a part of the Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD) of the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI). = Nordic DataGrid Facility and NeIC = ARC is the basis of the computing infrastructure of the Nordic Data Grid Facility (NDGF). In 2006-2010 NDGF actively contributed to ARC development, and since 2010 provides ARC deployment expertise within EGI. Since 2012, NDGF became a part of the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration.NeIC Web site = KnowARC project = Grid-enabled Know-how Sharing Technology Based on ARC Services and Open Standards (KnowARC) was a Sixth Framework Programme Specific Targeted Research Project, funded under Priority IST-2005-2.5.4 \\"Advanced Grid Technologies, Systems and Services\\" from June 2006 to November 2009.KnowARC fact-sheet, EU IST database In many ways it was the project that shaped ARC. The main goal was to make ARC based on open community standards, and among the key results was creation of the standardized Hosting Environment for ARC services (HED).

It stars Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart and Jack Mullaney, and features Fred Clark. It is a parody of the then-popular spy film trend (the title is a spoof of two James Bond films: the 1962 film Dr. No and the 1964 hit Goldfinger), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films. Despite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain cult statushttp://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=600547%7C473995 for the appearance of horror legend Vincent Price and AIP's beach party film alumni, its in-jokes and over-the-top sexuality, the claymation title sequence designed by Art Clokey, and a title song performed by The Supremes. The movie was retitled Dr G. and the Bikini Machine in England: urban legend has it that this was because there were two doctors in the country called Doctor Goldfoot, but it was more likely due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond movies. The success of the film on its 1965 release led to a sequel, made the following year, entitled Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. Plot Price plays the titular mad scientist who, with the questionable assistance of his resurrected flunky Igor, builds a gang of female robots who are then dispatched to seduce and rob wealthy men. Avalon and Hickman play the bumbling heroes who attempt to thwart Goldfoot's scheme. The film's climax is an extended chase through the streets of San Francisco.

Frankie Avalon lifts her head, then looks at the camera and says, \\"It can't be!\\" Pregnant with her first child at the time, Funicello was placed in the stocks in order to hide her stomach. * Harvey Lembeck also makes a cameo appearance as his Eric Von Zipper character, enchained along with his motorcycle in Goldfoot's lair. Lembeck also appeared as Goldfoot's assistant, Hugo, in the TV special The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot. * Among the girls who play Goldfoot's robots are Deanna Lund, three years before joining the cast of Irwin Allen's science fiction series Land of the Giants; China Lee, a former Playboy Playmate married to Mort Sahl; Luree Holmes and Laura Nicholson, the daughters of James H. Nicholson; and Alberta Nelson, who was also in all seven of AIP's Beach Party films as a member of Eric Von Zipper's motorcycle gang, The Rat Pack. Production =Development= The original idea for this motion picture came from James H. Nicholson, the President of American International Pictures, who wanted to showcase the versatile talents of AIP contract player Susan Hart. Nicholson provided the story, and is credited as \\"James Hartford.\\" He hired Robert Kaufman to write the first draft. Director Norman Taurog hired Elwood Ullman to do a rewrite, and Taurog remained intimately involved with the content. Deke Heyward later claimed, without substantiation, that he completely rewrote Robert Kaufman's script.Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas, \\"Louis M. Heyward\\" Science Fiction Stars and Horror Heroes: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Producers and Writers of the 1940s through 1960s McFarland (1991) pp.157–158, 166 The original title was announced as Dr Goldfoot and the Sex Machine, and the film was to be directed by William Asher. Taurog shortly thereafter assumed the helm as director, and Dwayne Hickman joined the cast. Filming began in late summer 1965, with one of AIP's largest-ever budgets. It was the first AIP movie to cost over a million dollars. Vincent Price stated in a 1987 interview with David Del Valle that the original script was a camp musical, comparing it to Little Shop of Horrors. Price stated, \\"It could have been fun, but they cut all the music out\\", though he is not clear whether the footage was actually shot or the idea was abandoned during production. According to Susan Hart: > One of the best scenes I've seen on film was Vincent Price singing about the > bikini machine – it was excellent. And I was told it was taken out because > Sam Arkoff thought that Vincent Price looked too fey. But his character was > fey!

This apparently disappointed Vincent Price, who > had been looking forward to singing. =Shooting= The film is notable for its scenic photography of San Francisco. The streetcar scene was filmed at the West Portal tunnel. Filming went for over 30 days, taking place on location in San Francisco and on the backlots at the Producers Studio and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. The day after the company returned from San Francisco, rioting broke out in Watts in South Los Angeles. On August 30, the unit moved to MGM Studios Lot 2 to shoot on their \\"New York Street\\" set for a couple of days before returning to the Producers Studio. The climactic chase sequence was filmed in the Bay Area. The stuntmen included Carey Loftin, Paul Stader, Troy Melton, Jerry Summers, Ronnie Ron-dell, Bob Harris, Louis Elias, David Sharpe, Harvey Parry, and Bill Hickman.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 When designing Goldfoot's lair, Daniel Haller re-used some of his designs from 1961's The Pit and the Pendulum.

Susan Hart's hair was done by Jon Peters.pp. 138-139 Weaver =Accident= During filming in Los Angeles, the city was gripped by a heatwave. Sometimes temperatures on one of the sound stages reached over by mid-afternoon. On the afternoon of August 15, 1965, the company was returning from lunch when one of the electricians, Roy Hicks, passed out from the heat and fell to his death from a catwalk. =Theme song= The theme song was recorded by The Supremes as a single-sided unreleased promotional single.Ribowsky, M.

Price is splendid.\\"Harford, Margaret. \\"'Goldfoot' Sparkling Comedy\\" Los Angeles Times (November 13, 1965) Sequel AIP Television produced a musical TV special episode promoting Doctor Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine that appeared for one night in temporary place of the ABC scheduled show Shindig! This show, called The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot, starred Vincent Price, Tommy Kirk and Susan Hart, and featured many songs that may have been cut from the cinema release.The title of the television show may have been inspired by the November 1965 The Incredible World of James Bond designed to give publicity to the upcoming release of Thunderball. Louis M. Heyward and Stanley Ross wrote the 30-minute short comedy musical TV special which aired Nov 18, 1965 on the ABC network. In July 1965 it was announced a sequel would be made the following year called Dr. Goldfoot for President, to begin filming May 14, 1966 for a September 14 release.\\"AIP to Discontinue Second Features\\", Box Office (July 5, 1965) Vincent Price returned for the 1966 sequel, Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs, directed by Mario Bava.

Like all anemonefish it is usually found living in association with sea anemones. While the common name of Heteractis crispa, the sebae anemone, suggests an association, it is normally found with the Stichodactyla haddoni or saddle anemone. A. sebae, like all anemonefish, lives in a symbiotic relationship with the host anemone where the fish is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the anemone. In a group of clownfish, Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, changing from male to female, with a strict dominance hierarchy and only the largest fish being female. Description The body of A. sebae is blackish or dark brown with a yellow snout, breast and belly. It has two broad white bars., with the mid-body bar angled backwards. The tail is yellow or orange. They have 10–11 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 14–17 dorsal soft rays and 13–14 anal soft rays. They can grow to . =Color variations= There is a melantistic variation where the fish lacks the yellow snout, breast and belly. It is not known whether this variation is associated with a species of anemone. =Similar species= A. polymnus (Saddleback anemonefish) is similar, but can be distinguished by its characteristic black or dark wedge shape on the tail. There are reports of A. sabae being incorrectly labeled in the aquarium trade as A. clarkii, however the similarities are superficial in that, while a melanistic variation of A. clarkii has similar color, A. clarkii lacks the characteristic sloping mid- band.

The male starts courting the female a week before they spawn. The male initiates maintenance of the site chosen for habitation. The female enters the nest to lay her eggs. About 300 to 600 eggs are laid. The males usually guard the eggs, which hatch after six to eight days. The yolk sac of the larvae was small. Between the third and fourth day they fed and their body shape changed. On days fifteen to eighteen in their life cycle they enter metamorphosis. Eggs When A. sebae eggs are recently fertilized, they are transparent (yellow/clear) with oil droplets. Amphiprion sebae eggs mature, they become bright yellow to orange color, the size of the eggs can range from length: 1.7- 2.6 mm and width: 0.8-1.3 mm.

(Latin: vasa, \\"vessels\\"; recta, \\"straight\\"). They lie parallel to the loop of Henle. These vessels branch off the efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary nephrons (those nephrons closest to the medulla). They enter the medulla, and surround the loop of Henle. Whereas the peritubular capillaries surround the cortical parts of the tubules, the vasa recta go into the medulla and are closer to the loop of Henle, and leave to ascend to the cortex. Terminations of the vasa recta form the straight venules, branches from the plexuses at the apices of the medullary pyramids. They run outward in a straight course between the tubes of the medullary substance and join the interlobular veins to form venous arcades. These in turn unite and form veins which pass along the sides of the renal pyramids. The descending vasa recta have a non-fenestrated endothelium that contains a facilitated transport for urea; the ascending vasa recta have,on the other hand,a fenestrated endothelium.  Structure  =Microanatomy= On a histological slide, the straight arterioles can be distinguished from the tubules of the loop of Henle by the presence of blood. Function Each straight arteriole has a hairpin turn in the medulla and carries blood at a very slow rate – two factors crucial in the maintenance of countercurrent exchange that prevent washout of the concentration gradients established in the renal medulla. The maintenance of this concentration gradient is one of the components responsible for the kidney's ability to produce concentrated urine. On the descending portion of the vasa recta, sodium chloride and urea are reabsorbed into the blood, while water is secreted. On the ascending portion, sodium chloride and urea are secreted into the interstitium, while water is reabsorbed. Clinical significance The slow blood flow in the straight arterioles makes them a likely location of thrombosis from thrombophilia, or tissue loss due to red blood cell sickling in sickle cell disease. Ischemia that results may lead to renal papillary necrosis.  Nomenclature  According to Terminologia Anatomica, the term \\"vasa recta renis\\" is an alternate name for \\"arteriolae rectae renis\\", and a separate term, venulae rectae renis, is used to identify the venous portion. However, other sources consider \\"vasa recta\\" to refer to both the arterial and venous portions.

He was the wealthiest person in Maine from 1850 to 1878, and is considered to have introduced both the Efficiency and Taylorism movements to the economy of Maine. Bates was born to a large family in Mansfield, Massachusetts; he moved to Bristol, Maine, for a working residency at B. T. Loring Company before creating the Davis, Bates & Turner–a craft goods and service firm in the early 1830s. After entering the milling business, he built the Bates Mill in 1852 which launched the larger Bates Manufacturing Company in Lewiston, Maine. His company quickly became the largest per capita employer in Maine and the largest in Lewiston, for three decades. Contracted by the Maine State Legislature, Bates founded the Lewiston Water Power Company: a large mill- based enterprise that built the first canal in the city. At the start of the American Civil War, Bates correctly anticipated that the talk of secession in the Southern States would lead to a shortage of cotton. By buying up an unprecedented amount prior to the Battle of Fort Sumter, he cornered the market. The resulting shortage created an absolute monopoly and skyrocketing prices, which drove dozens of New England businesses to close due to the inability to compete. Growing economic inequality in the city culminated to 1861 Lewistown cotton riots which led Bates to loosen his expansionary business tactics and increase philanthropic spending. Like other business magnates at the time, such as J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, Bates supported capitalism and anti-competitiveness. The public's opinion of Bates was highly polarized throughout his life with some citing his economic impact as critical, while others criticized his business tactics as socially detrimental. Early life and education Benjamin Edward Bates IV, was born in Mansfield, Massachusetts, on July 12, 1808, to Hannah Copeland and Elkanah Bates as their third child (of seven). His father, Elkanah Bates, was a cotton manufacturer and prominent merchant. Both of his parents were religious and belonged to the Congregational Church of Mansfield. In 1838, the new denomination split from the church to create a theologian association that questioned the divinity of Christ, Elkanah Bates was picked to lead the movement. His paternal grandfather fought in the American Revolution as a Captain, and later became a brigadier general for the Massachusetts state militia. He is the great-great grandson of Benjamin Bates II, Commander of the Devonshire Forces, and member of the Hell Fire Club. When Bates was a younger boy, his brother recounts him being dragged by two horses across a \\"considerable distance\\" which left him badly cut and bruised, he pulled the horses down and eventually halted their movement, a considerable task considering Bates was only 14 years old at the time. Bates attended various private schools and enrolled at the age of 15 to the Wrentham Academy, and studied there from 1823 to 1825, before moving to Boston, Massachusetts in 1829, at age 21. Bates entered the dry goods business with Barnabas T. Loring on Washington Street. At age 24, he made a public profession of Christian faith, and he was a lifelong Congregationalist and temperance supporter. Bates taught Sunday school at several churches in Boston including Park Street Church and was later an active member of Central Congregational Church in Boston. Business pursuits =B. T. Loring & Co.= John G. Davis met Benjamin Bates in the early 1830s and the two later became business partners. They met while Bates was a clerk for Barnabas T. Loring on Washington Street after a mutual friend offered \\"a firm with respected work.\\" At the time with Bates' net worth was at $700, which was considered lower-middle class at the time. The firm subsequently organized as the B. T. Loring Company. The firm's market expanded widely throughout Maine and went on to depart from retail and focus on whole sale, which was made possible by the connections Bates had made throughout his career in Bristol, Maine. One year later, they moved \\"downtown\\" from Washington Street to Central Street, and continued operations. Barnabas T. Loring died prompting the group to dissolve B. T. Loring & Co., and create Davis, Bates, & Turner. Lewiston, in the late nineteenth century =Davis, Bates & Turner= With the conclusion of B. T. Loring & Co., Bates co-founded the firm of Davis, & Bates, which existed from 1833 until 1847. The firm enjoyed financial success as its previous deals garnered high standing among the mercantile community of Maine. With the firm on stable footing, John N. Turner developed an interest and discussed furthered involvement. As a mutual friend of Bates, and his background in law, he was tasked with bookkeeping and legal relations. The firm amassed tens of thousands of dollars within years and the firm continued to grow. Turner was officially brought in on February 13, 1833, and the firm was officially renamed Davis, Bates & Turner. Efficiency movement Bates was known for his part in integrating the early manifestations of Taylorism in industrial Maine. His management style required high levels of managerial control and power over aggregated output which subsequently strained work practices. His firms were known for long work hours, poor working conditions and high output. He tended to his businesses \\"compulsively and incessantly\\" and often disregarded pressures to start a family, however did leave them with a considerable fortune at his death. Financial panic of 1837 In 1837, the firm experienced low levels of revenue and output due to the external effects of panics involving financial security and credit in New York City. Considered the \\"greatest financial panic the country has ever seen\\", the Panic of 1837 caused numerous firms all over New England to fail, and Davis, Bates & Turner, often had trouble assessing market value and withdrawing loans from the banks. The firm remained active and even put up positive net return on some years during the panic due to their good credit and lack of debt. Due to the overall speculative markets involving whole sale goods, Bates' firm remained cautious when selling and taking out loans for restructuring. News from New York was delivered to Maine stating further banking regulation and overall stabilization of market prices, which brought the state out of a recessive period into a sustained growth. The news was received by Bates personally when George Bond, declared that loans would be issued by the New York Banks once again. Tompkins square riot in the 1870s, due to lack of credit stability of Manhattan banks During the recovery consultations between Maine and Massachusetts business leaders, a prominent banker, Homer Bartlett was quoted as famously saying, > Who was the strongest man in that meeting [referring to the financial > panics]? To which the crowd overwhelmingly replied, > Bates! Bates was the strongest man there. This quote would go on to largely shape Bates' minor celebrity status and fed the growing reputation of producing the best results in times of uncertainty. The crowd included, Lyman Nichols, George L. Ward, Alexander De Witt, Francis Skinner, Homer Bartlett, and St. John Smith. In 1840, the firm moved to Water Street, and five years later moved to Milk Street, where Davis withdrew from the firm due to poor health. =Bates, Turner & Co. and Union Pacific= Siles Bascom replaced Davis and the firm was renamed Bates, Turner & Co. The firm enjoyed financial success and began to conclude its practice with the closing of markets in March 1847. After the dissolution of the firm, Bates served as president and on the board of several banking, manufacturing, and railroad corporations, including First National Bank of Commerce in Boston. Due to his activities during the financial panic of 1837, he was asked to be the founding successor president of the Union Pacific Railroad on August 1, 1849; he served in this capacity until May 3, 1850, when Alexander De Witt spoke to him about opportunities in Lewiston, Maine prompting his immediate resignation. Life in Lewiston Alexander De Witt advised Bates on development strategy in Lewiston. Bates travel to Lewiston regularly while living in Boston and other Maine towns, to \\"interact with the people, give guidance to the businesses, and support its economy.\\" After the closing of Bates, Turner & Co., and a quick stint as president of the Union Pacific Railroad, he moved to Lewiston, Maine upon the advisement of his close friend and confidant Alexander De Witt who went on describe Lewiston as a \\"city full of hope and innovation.\\" He was escorted to the town secretly with De Witt, to meet with the city council and Mayor to discuss major developments in the town. =Bates Manufacturing Company= Bates quickly began developing companies, acquiring smaller ones under his Manufacturing Company, and subsequently brought in sixteen million dollars in revenue for the town, the largest circulation of currency in the history of Lewiston at the time. His businesses provided employment for thousands of people from Maine and Canada, which made him the single largest employer in the city, and the largest per capita of Maine. His businesses garnered millions of dollars for the city and with all assets accounted for in Maine and Massachusetts, he was considered the wealthiest man in Maine via his net worth. His principle accomplishment during his early business career was the establishment of Bates Manufacturing Company. The company went on to be the largest manufacturing company in the state of Maine and provided two- thirds of all textile output for the state. It employed approximately five thousand people from Canadian and Irish descent. He served as the president of the company from its founding on January 3, 1850 until he appointed a successor to overtake the company as he left for Lewiston, Maine on February 20, 1862. =Lewiston Water Power Company= One of the primary goals of other business leaders in Maine and Bates was to improve the water quality of Lewiston. Bates went on to found the Lewiston Water Power Company, which built the first canal in the city. It employed hundreds of people and established the town as a \\"paragon of water quality.\\" During this development Lewiston was the fastest growing city in Maine, in terms of growth rate. =Bates Mill= Bates Mill and Canal The Bates Mill was a textile factory company founded in 1850 and located at 35 Canal Street in Lewiston, Maine. Much of the capital generated from this mill was used in the foundation of Bates College. Since conception, Bates' practices with the mill dominated the mill industry and was one of the first great U.S. business trusts. He initially gained wealth and influence from manufacturing textiles and estate development with correspondence to the mills. His mills extended from the Androscoggin River to northern Lewiston. On August 16, 1850, Maine Governor John Hubbard signed the incorporation act and the mill was completed 1852. Bates positioned the mill in Lewiston due to the location of the Lewiston Falls which provided the mill with power. Under Bates' supervision, during the Civil War, the mill produced textiles to the Union Army. His mills generated employment for thousands of Canadians, and immigrants from Europe. The mill was Maine's largest employer for three decades. 1861 Lewistown cotton riots Like numerous factories in Maine, Bates' mill was receiving cotton from the South, where it was grown and cultivated by slave labor. Correctly anticipating that the increasing talk of secession in the Southern States might eventually lead to a shortage of cotton, Bates bought an unprecedented amount of cotton prior to the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the War, Bates was able to produce uniforms for the Union Army as well as other textiles. His capitalization of this, saw to great levels of profit for his firms and companies, and caused dozens of mills to be closed due to overwhelming competition. After a rumor was spread around Lewiston that Bates held more money than the city, riots broke out in 1861, that decried the concentration wealth presented by Bates. Due to pressure from the public, he lessened his business tactics and created the philanthropic arm of the Bates Manufacturing Company tasked with giving out thousands to the people of Lewiston. During the riots his public image was tarnished and was advised by DeWitt to employ more people in his Mills. The Lewiston Sun Journal called him \\"the supplier of the cause,\\" after he spoke at a town hall meeting detailing his employment of thousands of New Englanders and Canadians. Later life and wealth =Economic panic of 1873= A bust of Bates sculpted by Franklin Simmons in 1872, held at the Boston Commonwealth Museum Bates pledged another $100,000 to be paid to the Maine State Seminary after his death, but due to the economic recession in the 1870s, known as the Panic of 1873, Bates' Lewiston assets were lessened. During this financial crisis many of his properties lessened in value and he was forced to refinance. Due to the dependence of Lewiston on Bates many citizens suffered financially in the personal losses of Bates. After the stabilization of his properties and business contracts he began a further expansion into Lewiston's economic environment, and regained considerable wealth. He built Bates Mill No.5 which became his fastest growing Mill within years and provided the city with substantial employment. =Wealth= By his death in 1878, Bates had amassed a total net worth of approximately $79.4 million (worth $1.84 billion in 2017). This includes assets held in Maine, New York, and Massachusetts that encompassed the non-operational value of B. T. Loring & Co., Bates, Turner & Co., his holding company the Bates Manufacturing Company, his stake in the Lewiston Water Company, Bates Mill, and miscellaneous banking endeavors in New York. He donated a total of $100,000 to the endowment, and approximately $250,000 to Bates College, indirectly and left a trust of $3.3 million to his family. In his will he pledged $50,000 to his wife Sarah Gilbert along with his 2.8 million dollar estate, $10,000 to his brother William, $10,000 to his brother Elkanah Bates II, $10,000 equally divided among the children of his sister, Charlotte, $10,000 to Edward Atkinson, and $10,000 to George Fabian. He left each of his children, Benjamin Edward V, Lilian, Sarah, and Author $250,000 in the form of a trust. However, Bates had $200,000 in outstanding debt and a pledged $100,000 to Bates College after his death. His family was required expend the $100,000 pledged but due to conditions placed on the inheritances, restricted distribution, and familial debt, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts eventually ruled that Bates' heirs did not have to pay Bates College the pledged $100,000. After a period of recession the college began to financially recuperate to a larger endowment, independently. Over the next couple of years Bates College's endowment has grown slowly and steadily. =Philanthropy= 248x248px Bates was the largest of the early donors to Maine State Seminary through the Lewiston Power Company. He was known by the people of Lewiston for having a \\"deep and profound love\\" for the town and the college, and its early founder mentioned his affection by noting: \\"I have frequently heard him say that he would not knowingly do anything against the interests of the people; and that he would sooner invest ten dollars in Lewiston than one dollar in any other place. 'I love Lewiston', 'I love the College', he was accustomed to say, 'Say to the Trustees that I love the College.'\\"Oren Burbank CheneyIn 1852, he personally pledged another $6,000 to the school. In 1853, Oren Burbank Cheney appointed him as a Trustee of the College and in 1854 subsequently became Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the college due to his considerable donations. He went onto donate $25,000 for the foundation of agriculture department and moved a subscription of $75,000 for campus expansion. On February 21, 1873, he donated $100,000 on the condition that the amount was met by third-party donors, within five years. Although he placed conditions on his donations, he realized his donations regardless of the conditions being met. The college remained a source of worry for Bates as much of the subscriptions to the college remained unfilled, donors were giving half of their donations and not fulfilling the other half, which left the endowment of the college in a speculative state. Bates served as the treasurer for the college in the early days and condemned the business strategy Cheney developed when interacting with potential donors advocating for a more aggressive procedure for funding. His work with the college prompted fellow business magnate, Andrew Carnegie, to donate a considerable amount to the formation of the college and subsequently had the college's science building named after him. Bates played an integral role in the expansion of the college, moving from town to town and state to state spreading the institutions name. This brought in tens of thousands of dollars from the politically elite and wealthy who donated more on a favor to Bates than love of the college, as Bates had graduated little alumnus who went on to amass wealth. By his death in 1878, Bates' donations to the college totalled over $100,000, and overall contributions valued at US$250,000 (worth US$6.2 million in March 2017 dollars). On March 16, 1864, the founder of the Maine State Seminary, Oren Burbank Cheney, renamed his institution of higher learning, \\"Bates College,\\" in honor of Bates. However, when hearing that the college was renamed after him, he expressed his disappointment. He thought that he was not worthy of a college of \\"[such] inception and history,\\" later noting his guilt for raising money for the college because donors might have thought he was raising money for himself. Death and legacy Maine State Seminary led the founder of the college to rename the college in his honor in 1864. Bates' grave at the 233x233pxBenjamin Bates died on January 14, 1878 at age 69, in Boston, Massachusetts. His body was entombed at the Mount Auburn Cemetery on Fir Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts two days later. Bates Street, West Bates Street, and East Bates Street in Lewiston and Auburn, Maine, respectively, are named in his honor. His death was attended by Lewiston, Boston, and New York City elite, and the Mayors of numerous cities gave speeches on his life. His funeral was held in the Lewiston City Hall, and clergymen gave speeches on his commitment to the college and God. He was survived by his wife, Sarah Chapman Gilbert (his second wife and daughter of Joseph Gilbert, niece of Abijah Gilbert) who lived from 1832 to 1882 and his four children: * Josephine Bates Hammond (1839–1886) * Benjamin Edward Bates V (1863–1906) * Sarah Frances Bates Herschel (1867–1937) * Lillian Gilbert Bates (1872–1951) * Arthur Hobart Herschel (1870–1953) Bates College's inaugural president, Oren Burbank Cheney said the following of Bates delivering his eulogy: > Bates wanted labor for our laborers, education for our children, places of > worship for our worshipers, light for our streets, water for our houses, and > a hospital for our sick and our dying.

The T puzzle is a tiling puzzle consisting of four polygonal shapes which can be put together to form a capital T. The four pieces are usually one isosceles right triangle, two right trapezoids and an irregular shaped pentagon. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is a surprisingly hard puzzle of which the crux is the positioning of the irregular shaped piece. The earliest T puzzles date from around 1900 and were distributed as promotional giveaways. From the 1920s wooden specimen were produced and made available commercially. Most T puzzles come with a leaflet with additional figures to be constructed. Which shapes can be formed depends on the relative proportions of the different pieces. Origins and early history =The Latin Cross= The Latin cross puzzle (left) and the T puzzle (right). The Latin cross puzzle consists of a reassembling a five-piece dissection of the cross with three isosceles right triangles, one right trapezoids and an irregular shaped six-sized piece (see figure). When the pieces of the cross puzzle have the right dimensions, they can also be put together as a rectangle. From Chinese origin, the oldest examples date from the first half of the nineteenth century.The Jerry Slocum Mechanical Puzzle Collection holds a carved ivory cross puzzle dated 1820–1850: Image collection of the Slocum puzzles at The Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. Accessed August 18, 2013. One of the earliest published descriptions of the puzzle appeared in 1826 in the 'Sequel to the Endless Amusement'. Many other references of the cross puzzle can be found in amusement, puzzle and magicians books throughout the 19th century. The T puzzle is based on the cross puzzle, but without head and has therefore only four pieces. Another difference is that in the dissection of the T, one of the triangles is usually elongated as a right trapezoid. These changes make the puzzle more difficult and clever than the cross puzzle. =Advertising premiums= The Lash's Bitters T-puzzle, the earliest known version of the puzzle The T-puzzle became very popular in the beginning of the 20th century as a giveaway item, with hundreds of different companies using it to promote their business or product.

Solving the puzzle \\"I know of no polygon- dissection puzzle with as few pieces that is so intractable.\\" – Martin Gardner With only four pieces, the T puzzle is deceitfully simple. Studies have shown that few people are able solve it under five minutes, with most people needing more than half an hour to solve it. A common response of subjects is to conclude that the puzzle is impossible to solve. The main difficulty in solving the puzzle is overcoming the functional fixedness of putting the pentagon piece either horizontally or vertically; and related to this, the tendency of trying to fill up the notch of the pentagon. In one study participants were found to spend over 60% of their attempts on such misguided placements of the pentagon piece. And even when the pentagon piece happened to be placed properly, it was mostly not recognized as part of the solution, as a match with the T is not easily seen. The puzzle is easily solved when the insight is reached that the pentagon is part of both the horizontal and vertical stem of the T and that the notch in the pentagon constitutes an inside corner.

The school has had a recent expansion, and also shares the building with Fanshawe College. History In September 1925, a new addition was built onto Holy Angel's Elementary School consisting of two classrooms, a chemistry laboratory in the basement, a Board Room and a library. Sister Fideles Fortune was appointed as principal and St. Joseph's High School was born. In September 1929, Sister Grace Gleeson became the new principal and in order to accommodate a growing enrolment was aided by Sister St. Catherine. Embracing the age of modern technology, a manual typewriter was purchased by the Board exclusively for school use but residing in the convent. The girls of St. Joseph's wore a blue and white uniform that remained the standard of school fashion until 1970, when it was replaced by a plaid kilt with brown blazer. The school crest and blue and gold colours were established at this time and remain a tradition to this day. Father Remi Durand introduced boys' basketball and softball in 1929, and the St. Joseph's Saints were born. This would begin a long history of athletic success at St. Joe's. During the 1930s and '40s St. Joseph's stayed abreast with administrative and curriculum changes initiated by the Ontario Department of Education, such as adding grade 13 to the curriculum. This expansion of the school program allowed students to graduate directly to University from the Parish school system. For those students who were entering the world of business after high school, a Special Commercial program was also added to the curriculum at this time. World War II called thousands of Canadians to service including many from St. Thomas. Hugh Cassidy, Walter McManus and Donald Udell, students of St. Joseph's, sacrificed their lives in the service of their country and are remembered by generations of students to this day. Car pools and buses brought students to St. Joseph's from Port Stanley, Rodney, Shedden, Sparta, Wallacetown, Glanworth, West Lorne, Aylmer and Tillsonburg during the 1940s and '50s. In order to meet this growth in enrolment, two new classrooms were added particularly for grade eleven and twelve students. In 1953, a new gymnasium was added, providing an alternative to the use of outside facilities at the YMCA and St. Thomas Collegiate. The girls' basketball teams won consecutive WOSSA basketball championships and the boys' football team contended in the WOSSA final. Students performed in musicals and operettas. School functions were often followed by informal gatherings at the White Palace or Gettas Restaurant. In 1955, a new science lab, principal's office; library and two additional classrooms were added to the school building. Significant to the growth of St. Joe's sporting tradition was the addition of Tommy White to the school staff in 1956. White was a renowned local and semi-professional baseball player and manager, intercollegiate basketball referee, and basketball player. He was known locally as owner of Tommy White's Sport Shop, a sporting goods outlet. Items purchased from the establishment retained White's distinctive cigars long after their purchase and use. Tommy White served as coach for basketball, football, volleyball, soccer and golf for over 24 years. Despite a fiery competitive spirit, White endeavoured to provide all interested young athletes with an opportunity to participate. White's memorial plaque adorns the entrance to the St. Joe's gymnasium, which has been named in his honour. In September 1965, it became necessary to introduce tuition fees to help cover the rising cost of modern education. Fees continued to be charged until the completion of Catholic Education in 1986. Throughout the history of St. Joseph's, fundraising activities provided necessary support to the school. Spaghetti dinners, Bingo, rummage sales, days of apple picking, and other events provided necessary funding to the school. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Catholic community contributed financial assistance for renovations at the school. The Knights of Columbus, Catholic Women's League, St. Anne's Festival Board, St. Joseph's Board of Governors, and the Friends of St. Joseph's have made contributions to sustaining the viability of the school. St. Joseph's continued to offer a co-curricular program in the era following the extension of full funding. While the school population in the classrooms grew beyond the capacity of the White St. school building, a dynasty emerged in girls' basketball. The St. Joe's senior girls were provincial champions in 1986, '87, '88, '91, '92, '93, and '95 and finalists in 1996 and '98. The senior boys' teams were provincial champions in 1994 and 1998 and finalists in 1995 and '96. The impact of full funding was realized on May 4, 1990, when the Ministry of Education announced the allocation of $7,036,000 to build Phase I of the New St. Joseph's Catholic High School. On February 4, 1994, the new school was opened to welcome five hundred students. The new school building provided students with an expanded academic and co-instructional program including Instrumental and Vocal Music, Drama, Physical Education and Fitness, Environmental Science and Technological Studies. The school was designed with a particular focus on environmental science and that continues to be an emphasis at the school to the present. With access to a sports field, St. Joseph's instituted a football program in 1997. Starting with a junior program in the first year and adding a senior in the second, the St. Joe's Rams have quickly become competitive in the local football conference and the football program has provided a focus for school spirit at the beginning of the school year. St. Joseph's continues to enjoy the support of the Elgin County community as reflected in the growing enrolment. In 2002, some 640 students were enrolled and nine portable classrooms have been added to the site over the past few years. Plans for a reorganization of the technology area have been proposed and have received support in principle from the London District Catholic School Board. However, in 2008, the student body population reached a nearly 900 students that daily try to fit themselves in the school built for 500 students. The Rams football team won the TVRAA South-East football championship five years in a row following a loss in the league finals in 2003.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, after learning that he finally has been accepted into Starfleet Academy, Wesley Crusher welcomes Picard's invitation to accompany him on an away mission that could resolve a mining dispute on an arid world. But following a shuttle crash and a near disastrous search for water that leaves the captain near death, Wesley finds himself charged with the weighty responsibility of keeping both himself and Picard alive until a rescue team can locate them. Plot The Enterprise has traveled to the Pentarus system where Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must mediate a dispute among some miners on the fifth planet. Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) receives word that he has been accepted to Starfleet Academy and, for his final mission, he will accompany Picard on his shuttle trip to Pentarus V. A distress call comes in from Gamilon V, where an unidentified vessel has entered orbit and is giving off lethal doses of radiation. Picard orders Riker to take the Enterprise to resolve that situation while he and Wesley travel in a shuttle sent by the miners, commanded by Captain Dirgo. En route, Dirgo's shuttle malfunctions and they are forced to crash-land on the surface of a harsh, desert-like moon. Though they are unharmed, the shuttle is beyond repair, and its communication systems and food replicators are disabled. Dirgo admits he has no emergency supplies on board, so they are forced to search for shelter and water. With his tricorder, Wesley identifies some caves and a potential source of water some distance away, and the three set out across the desert. Reaching a cave, they find a fountain-like water source, but it is protected by a crystalline force field. Dirgo attempts to use a phaser to destroy the field, but this activates a burst of energy from the fountain which encases the phaser in an impenetrable shell and causes a rock slide; Picard pushes Wesley out of the way but is severely injured in doing so. Meanwhile, the Enterprise has arrived at Gamilon V, finding the unidentified ship is an abandoned garbage scow filled with radioactive waste. Their initial attempt to attach thrusters to the barge to propel it through an asteroid belt into the Gamilon sun remotely fails, and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) is forced to attempt to tow the barge themselves using the tractor beam, exposing the crew to the lethal radiation. As Wesley continues to analyze the forcefield, Dirgo becomes impatient and attempts to breach the field again, but this time the energy burst encases him as well, killing him. Picard, weak from his injuries, gives Wesley advice about the academy, and tells him he is proud of him. Wesley refuses to give up. Meanwhile, the Enterprise, despite the rising radiation levels on board, which are nearing lethal, manages to get the barge headed into the sun and speeds off to help in the search for the shuttle. Wesley continues to study the fountain, and devises a plan to disable the force field. He fires his phaser at the fountain to attract the energy defense mechanism, but reprograms it using his tricorder to disable the field instead, and is finally able to access the water. Shortly thereafter, the Enterprise locates the wreckage of the mining shuttle, and Picard and Wesley are rescued. As Picard is carried from the cave, he tells Wesley that he will be missed.

The film tells the story of a centuries old vampire, Simon Molinar (Jason Carter) who gets captured by a government group calling themselves The Delphi Project. The team of scientists and government officials proceed to study the vampire in captivity. It's only one member of the team, a Dr. Joe McKay, who starts to treat the vampire captive like an actual person rather than as an experiment. Dr. Mckay is forced to see the humanity of their monster captive and the ruthless cruelty of his own team and raises the question of what defines a monster? Plot Someone has been killing women in LA and leaving the bodies drained of blood. The police planned a sting using a female officer, Detective Gwen Taylor (Denise Alessandria Hurd) however the killer was instead intercepted and captured by a group calling itself The Delphi Project. The Delphi Project is a secret government group intent on capturing and studying a live vampire and as it turns out the killer that they are after is actually a thousand year old vampire going by the name Simon Molinar (Jason Carter). During the attempted capture Dr. Hirsch (James Kiberd) is killed by the vampire. A replacement doctor, Dr. Joe McKay (Garett Maggart) takes his place in the group. Out of the entire group Dr. Joe McKay is the first to treat the vampire like a person and not just as something to be studied. The group sets about a series of tests and experiments to study the vampire. As the experiments become crueler Dr. Joe McKay is left to wonder who is the true monster? The vampire or the very people he works for? Unbeknownst to Dr. Mckay is that one of his superiors, Dr. Bassett (Jack Donner) has found out that Dr. McKay is one of the rare few who has the genetic predisposition to being able to be turned into a vampire. Dr. Bassett (without the rest of the team's knowledge) even provides Simon Molinar with a live victim. Dr. Bassett, himself, discarded the body. When the body is found this gains the attention of the local police. The group decides to destroy Simon Molinar once their experiments are finished but Dr. Bassett thinks it might be best to create a new vampire, one that has never killed before, to replace the vampire they intend to destroy. Bassett locked Dr. McKay in a room with the vampire but Simon escaped instead of turning Dr. McKay into a vampire. During his escape Simon ripped the caduceus necklace from Dr. McKay's neck. It's a necklace that Dr. McKay never takes off and wore as a sign of healing and his Hippocratic oath. Simon Molinar stole this as a memento because of his growing fondness for Dr. McKay despite having been his prisoner. Novel differences The novel for Demon Under Glass, written by Deborah L. Warner (as D. L. Warner), was published the same year as the film's release. About two thirds of the novel is the same story as the film however the novel continues after Molinar's escape. After Simon Molinar escaped Dr. McKay is reassigned. Two years pass. Dr. McKay lives a normal life and even has a fiance. One evening Simon Molinar comes to retrieve Dr. McKay, bypassing his new high tech security system and risking his own life. Simon reveals to Dr. McKay that The Delphi Project is not dead. They were monitoring Dr. McKay for two years before deciding to proceed in an experiment using a serum created from Simon's blood samples. Their plan was to transform Dr. McKay into a vampire. Dr. McKay's whole life for two years had been a lie. Even his fiance had been a government agent involved in the project without him knowing it. Simon Molinar and Dr. McKay go on the run together in a desperate bid to stop the evil plan to create laboratory-made vampires.

Narrows Dam was authorized as a flood control and hydroelectric power project by the Flood Control Act of 1941. The dam is a feature of the comprehensive plan for the Ouachita River Basin. Lake Greeson is operated for hydroelectric power, recreation, and flood control. The powerhouse of the dam is located adjacent to the east abutment, and it has a total length of 151 feet. The equipment of the powerhouse is three 8,500 kW·h generating machines. The powerhouse originally had two generators, but a third was placed in 1969. The average annual output is 28,000,000 kW·h. The dam is named due to its location on the river, The Narrows. During the dam's construction many cemeteries and graveyards had to be removed due to the creation of the new lake. Narrows Dam is located by the Swaha, or Narrows Dam recreational area. Lake Greeson is divided into three layers so Narrows Dam can work and operate properly. The bottom portion of the lake always remains full so the powerhouse has enough pressure to operate. The middle layer or \\"Power Storage\\" portion is used to regulate the flow of water running into the generators of the dam. The top portion or \\"Flood Storage\\" is usually empty unless holding floodwater. A spillway at the top of the dam is used to regulate the top portion of the dam, the spillway contains walls to maneuver the flow of the water, and a stilling basin is placed at the foot of the spillway to dissipate erosion from the spillway water hitting the base of the dam. The spillway is not used frequently because flooding can be regulated by other means, such as the flood control conduits. Because of heavy rains during the first two weeks of May 2009, water poured over the spillway for the first time since 1968. Construction on the dam by the United States Army Corps of Engineers began on April 1947. The first bucket of concrete was poured in June 1948. The dam was finished in 1950, and dedicated in July 1951.

The phrase derives from the common catbird's habit of making mocking calls from a secluded perch. Source According to Douglas Harper's Online Etymological Dictionary, the phrase refers to the gray catbird and was used in the 19th century in the American South. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first documented use occurred in a 1942 humorous short story by James Thurber titled \\"The Catbird Seat\\", which features a character, Mrs. Barrows, who likes to use the phrase. Another character, Joey Hart, explains that Mrs. Barrows must have picked up the expression from the baseball broadcaster Red Barber, and that \\"sitting in the catbird seat\\" meant \\"'sitting pretty', like a batter with three balls and no strikes on him.\\" The phrase \\"in the catbird seat\\" was among the numerous folksy expressions used by radio sports broadcaster Red Barber. According to Barber's daughter, after her father read Thurber's story, he began using the phrase \\"in the catbird seat\\". This seems to reverse events, however, as the passage of story quoted above clearly references Barber. According to \\"Colonel\\" Bob Edwards's book Fridays with Red, Barber claimed that Thurber got this and many other expressions from him, and that Barber had first heard the term used during a poker game in Cincinnati, during the Great Depression. Barber also put forth this version of events in his 1968 autobiography, Rhubarb in the Catbird Seat. On sailing ships, the catbird seat is the crow's nest, a lookout.

It has a wingspan of approximately one inch and the antennae form a hook. The male’s wings are a tawny-orange to brown on the forewings with a prominent mark and dusty yellow on the lower part of the wing. The female wing is a darker brown orange and white spots on the forewing margin. Reproduction The adult Dakota skippers are active for only three weeks in June and July which is their total lifespan. Their eggs, which are laid on the underside of leaves, are hatched in July and the caterpillar larvae feed on native grass until they go dormant in late summer. The caterpillar larvae then winter in shelters very close to the ground. In spring they come out of dormancy in their adult form. They are found in healthy natural tall grass and prairie grass from Minnesota to Saskatchewan. They are now considered extirpated from Illinois and Iowa. The largest most stable population is now found in North Dakota.

Biography Gilliss was born on September 6, 1811 in Georgetown, District of Columbia. His parents were George Gilliss, a federal employee, and Mary (Melville) Gillis. In 1827 at the age of fifteen he joined the navy as a midshipman. He made several training cruises on the Delaware, the Java, and the Concord. In 1833 he passed his examinations and was advanced to passed midshipman.Gould (1866) In 1833 Gilliss requested a leave of absence and began his studies at the University of Virginia. Poor health forced him to leave after six months. He went to Paris for further studies in 1835 and was recalled to Washington to serve as an assistant at the Depot of Charts and Instruments in 1836. In late 1837 he married Rebecca Roberts of Alexandria, D.C. (now Va.). The Depot of Charts and Instruments was headed by Charles Wilkes. The depot was responsible for the navy's chronometers, charts, and other navigational instruments and provided Gilliss with an opportunity to practice astronomy. Astronomical observations were necessary to determine the accuracy of the Navy's chronometers. Gilliss proved himself to be an excellent astronomical observer. In 1837 he was named officer-in-charge of the depot and began an extensive series of observations of the moon and stars for the purpose of longitude determination. In February 1838 he was promoted to lieutenant.Dick (2000) In 1838 Wilkes left the depot to lead the U.S. Exploring Expedition and Gilliss replaced him as head of the organization. Gilliss began a series of celestial observations that were published in 1846 as Astronomical Observations made at the Naval Observatory, Washington. This reference listed some 1,248 stars and was the first star catalog published in the United States.Sterling (1997) Gilliss is most noted for his successful efforts to establish the U.S. Naval Observatory, the first national observatory in the United States. In 1841 he first proposed a new depot and personally lobbied congress for the funds. In 1842 Congress passed an authorization for $25,000 for a new depot and \\"a small observatory\\". Gilliss used the funds to equip the new building with astronomical instruments, including a 9.6-inch achromatic refracting telescope, a 5.5-inch transit instrument, a 4-inch meridian circle, and a 5-inch prime vertical telescope. He traveled to Europe to purchase the necessary instruments and books and by October 1844 the observatory was ready. However, because of internal politics Gilliss was not appointed director; that position went instead to Matthew Fontaine Maury (the secretary of the navy was from Maury's home state, Virginia). Santa Lucia Hill, site of Gilliss' observatory in Santiago, Chile. Gilliss continued working at the observatory, completing publication of his celestial catalog and providing support to the Office of Coast Survey. In 1848 he obtained $5,000 from Congress for a naval astronomical expedition to Chile in order to more precisely measure the solar parallax. Gilliss headed the expedition from August 1849 until his return in November 1852. In Chile the expedition enjoyed the support of the government, the University of Chile, the Military School plus a wide array of individuals. They successfully completed the planned astronomical observations and also made valuable observations of the earth's magnetic field, earthquakes, geography, politics and natural science. The specimens of fauna and flora brought back from Chile formed the earliest part of the Smithsonian collection from Latin America. The wide- ranging results of the expedition were published in as six-volume treatise, the United States Astronomical Expedition to the Southern Hemisphere, published 1855-1896. The observatory and staff he left in Chile became the nucleus of Chile's astronomical program, previous to this there was no astronomical tradition in Chile.Hidalgo Hermosilla (2017) Under the direct influnce of the expedition from 1850 onward the journal Anales de la Universidad de Chile begun to publish content on astronomy. Gilliss later led two expeditions to observe the solar eclipses in Peru in 1858 and Washington Territory in 1860. At the onset of the Civil War, Maury resigned to join the Confederate Navy and Gilliss was placed in charge of the observatory in 1861. He also became a founding member of the National Academy of Sciences and was promoted to captain in July 1862. During his four-year tenure, Gilliss reduced the backlog of scientific work that had gone unpublished, encouraged the manufacture of American-made astronomical equipment, and worked closely with other American observatories. His organization also played a crucial role in providing charts and navigation instruments to the rapidly expanding the Union navy.Dick (1996) Gilliss died unexpectedly on February 9, 1865. He had been looking forward to seeing his son who had just been released from a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp. That morning he collapsed and died from a stroke at the age of 53.

It was founded in 1626. Its first decades were very troubled as a result of the Thirty Years' War: the sisters often had to flee from enemy troops and the abbey was looted several times. The nunnery was able to evade destruction during the secularisation of 1802 by turning itself into a girls' school. During the Kulturkampf, the sisters went into exile in France from 1875 to 1887. In 1898, the nunnery was elevated to the status of abbey. In 1942, although most religious houses in Germany were commandeered by the National Socialists, the nuns were able to avoid eviction by offering the use of most of the premises to the Wehrmacht. After becoming closer in their way of life over a period of many years to the Beuronese Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation, the abbey finally became a member in 1982. The nuns engage in various handicrafts, run the abbey shop and have built a compost activator.

A color garden has a variety of colors in it so that it is more attracting. In the first sense, a color garden is a garden specially planted in order to display a wide variety of colors, often in a particular season (for example a fall color garden). In the second sense, a color garden may more accurately be labeled a single-color garden. Single color gardens Such a garden is planted so that it overwhelms the observer with a single color. While this may seem a rather bland approach at first, such gardens were made popular by the work of famous garden designers such as Gertrude Jekyll and Vita Sackville-West. Sackville-West, for example, created what may have been one of the most famous single-color gardens, the White Garden room of the Sissinghurst Castle Garden. White garden White Garden at Kensington Palace A white garden is a feature garden composed of plants that produce white flowers and spathes as well as plants with a white or silvery cast to their foliage. The white garden is a variant of the color garden. The most essential feature of the white garden is its unity of colour. The white garden is an informal gardening style that is similar in design to the English cottage garden. The open and informal design creates associations with romance, peace, and elegance. The white flowers are not usually placed in clusters, but spread throughout the garden's green areas, creating a natural look and feel. The mildly dense placement of white flowers creates a luminescent sight that is especially powerful in the twilight.

Located at Steele Barracks, Canadian Forces Base Edmonton, 1 Svc Bn is composed of the Battalion Headquarters and four functional companies: Transportation, Supply, Maintenance, and Administration. Administration Company is unique in that it provides first-line support to the battalion itself, while the remaining companies provide second- and limited third-line support to units across the 3rd Canadian Division. 1 Svc Bn generates forward support groups (FSGs) formed of personnel from each company in order to support domestic and international operations. 1 Svc Bn is a force generation unit that is capable of providing two company-sized FSGs to support operations at any given time. The battalion is composed of an integrated and cohesive team of active military members and public servants. Soldiers must maintain their soldiering and war-fighting skills to a high degree of proficiency, while concurrently developing expertise in their respective trades. The battalion's primary focus is on conducting and training for operations; however, the unit also provides combat service support on a daily basis to 1 CMBG and the 3rd Canadian Division. 1 Svc Bn has earned a reputation for providing outstanding support and has, over the past two decades, regularly generated, trained, and deployed the National Support Element (NSE) for several Canadian deployments. The unit motto is John D. Conrad, Officium Super Omnia – The History of 1 Service Battalion, Calgary, 1993 which translates to \\"duty above all\\". The current commanding officer is Lieutenant-Colonel Guillaume Grenier-Lachance and the regimental sergeant major is Chief Warrant Officer Scott Wilson.  History  1 Service Battalion (1 Svc Bn) was officially formed on 1 September 1968, however, the unit's roots can be traced back to around the start of the 20th century through the history of its functional companies: Transportation, Supply and Maintenance. These three companies are descendants of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC), the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC), and the Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) respectively. = Royal Canadian Army Service Corps = Until the formation of the service battalions in September 1968, all transportation service was provided by the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC). The RCASC was established, by General Order No. 141, as the Canadian Army Service Corps (CASC), on 1 November 1901. The CASC was modelled directly off the British Army Service Corps to provide all transportation and supply services to the Army. Initially, the CASC consisted of four companies to support the Active Militia units. The Corps grew quickly, doubling the number of units by 1903, and growing by another three companies by 1905. By the summer of 1914 the CASC had a strength of 3000 personnel in eighteen companies.Arnold Warren, Wait for the Waggon. The Story of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps. McClelland and Steward Limited, 1961. During World War I, the CASC provided a support element for each Canadian division, and later on, for the Canadian Corps. With the introduction of motorized vehicles, the CASC carried commodities of a greater range and of greater weights. Motorized transportation also resulted in expanded responsibilities such as driving ambulances and engineer pontoon vehicles, carrying all natures of ammunition, and mobile repair and recovery. In recognition of the services rendered during World War I, King George V authorized the designator \\"Royal\\" in 1919. The RCASC, along with the rest of the army, underwent a rapid expansion as Canada mobilized for the Second World War. The RCASC provided support to Canadian soldiers wherever they went; training in Canada and Great Britain, the campaign in north-west Europe, and in the campaign in Italy. The RCASC moved supplies from the rear areas to the front-lines. They delivered all rations, ammunition, petroleum products, and all other essentials. They did so with a variety of vehicles ranging from 3- to 10-ton trucks, and 40-ton tank transporters.Warren, Wait for the Waggon. During the 1950s, the RCASC committed No. 1 and No. 2 Movement Control Groups, 54 Canadian Transport Company, 28 Motorized Ambulance Company, and 58 General Transport Company to the Korean War. In 1952, 23 Transport Company relieved 54 Transport Company, which was in-turn relieved by 56 Transport Company. 3 Transport Company was the last to serve in Korea in 1954. 4 Transport Company (previously known as 56 Transport Company and then 5 Transport Company) moved from Winnipeg to Calgary in August 1967. In June 1968, 4 Transport Company combined with elements of the static 13 Transport Company. Three months later that organization became the Transport Company of 1 Svc Bn. = Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps = The Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC) can trace its roots back to the Canadian Stores Department. Formed in 1871, the Canadian Stores Department was a civil department of the Canadian Government. This civil service was charged with control of forts, ammunition, stores, buildings and an ordnance depot left by the departing British Military. On 1 July 1903, the responsibilities of the Canadian Stores Department were transferred to the Ordnance Stores Corps. In 1907 it was renamed the Canadian Ordnance Corps (COC).William F. Rannie, To the Thunderer, His Arms The Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps, W.F. Rannie Publisher, Lincoln, ON. During the First World War, the COC, in conjunction with the CASC, was supporting 400,000 men, 150,000 French civilians, and 25,000 horses. In 1919, for recognition of outstanding service during the War, King George V authorized the \\"Royal\\" designation.Rannie, To the Thunderer, His Arms. In the Second World War, the RCOC had a strength of 35,000 military personnel, not including the thousands of civilian personnel employed at RCOC installations. They procured all the material goods required by the Army, from clothing to weapons. Up until 1944, the RCOC was responsible for maintenance and repair. Ordnance Field Parks, that carried everything from spare parts to spare artillery, supported the Divisions and Corps. In 1960, 1 Ordnance Field Park moved from Edmonton to Calgary and in 1968 merged with the Base Supply organization to become the Supply Company of 1 Svc Bn. = Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers = The Corps of RCEME was formed on 15 May 1944 as an amalgamation of elements of the RCOC, the RCASC, and the Royal Canadian Engineers. It was modelled after the British Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). It was born out of lessons learned during the Second World War. It became apparent that due to the increasing complexity of military equipment, technical expertise needed to be pooled to be most effective.Colonel Murray Johnston, Canada's Craftsmen. The History of the RCEME Corps, 1983. After the Second World War, the RCEME contributed units to Canadian commitments overseas. RCEME units that served in the Korean War included No. 25 Canadian Support Workshop, No. 191 Canadian Infantry Workshop, No. 23 Infantry Workshop (renamed No. 40 Infantry Workshop), and No. 42 Infantry Workshop.Johnston, Canada's Craftsmen, 1983. No. 43 Infantry Workshop, which had gone to Germany as No. 195 Workshop, returned from service in Germany to Barriefield in 1955. In 1958, the unit was re-designated again as 1 Field Workshop. In mid-1958, the unit was moved to Calgary to support 1 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group. In September 1968, No. 1 Field Workshop merged with No. 215 Workshop and became Maintenance Company, 1 Svc Bn. = Formation to present day = As previously mentioned, the unit was officially stood up 1 September 1968. Initially, it was composed of a small headquarters, Transport Company, Supply Company, Maintenance Company, Construction Engineer Company, and Military Police Platoon. The battalion's tasks were: to deploy as a service support unit on order; to assist Canadian Forces Base Calgary with the provision of administrative support to local units; and, to provide a field logistics capability to support 1 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group. In 1975, the Military Police Platoon was removed from the organization to become 1 MP Platoon, and the Construction Engineer Company left and became part of CFB Calgary's Technical Services Branch. In 1976, the Administration Company was added to provide integral service support to the unit so that the unit could better concentrate on providing close and general support to the brigade group. The Administration Company consisted of the unit's headquarters, Transport Platoon, Supply Platoon, and Maintenance Platoon, as well as messing, personnel administration, and medical services.Canadian Forces Organization Order 3.80, 1 Service Battalion, Calgary, Alberta, 20 February 1969. In late 1978 and early 1979, a band was formed and took part in its initial training phase during rehearsals at a shack in Sarcee Barracks. Unlike others at the time, it was an unauthorized Canadian military band. Each member was issued band heraldry in the spring of the year and consisted of the following musicians at that time: the band sergeant, a band administration officer, a drum major, four snare drummers, two side drummers, a bass drummer, three glockenspiel players, three buglers, and two baritone buglers.https://milart.blog/2014/11/16/badges-of-the-1st-service-battalion- band/amp/ On 24 April 1982, in recognition of its support to and close association with the City of Calgary, 1 Svc Bn was awarded the freedom of the city. As part of the ceremony, the battalion marched to Calgary City Hall where Mayor (and later Alberta Premier) Ralph Klein presented the honour.Conrad, Officium Super Omnia, 1993. As a result of the government's decision to close CFB Calgary, 1 Svc Bn moved to Steele Barracks in Edmonton on 23 September 1996. In July 1999, as part of the army's combat service support core restructure, part of the battalion was removed to form 1 General Support Battalion (1 GS Bn). This relieved 1 Svc Bn of its static or base responsibilities. The smaller unit was then composed of Administration Company, Maintenance Company, and Supply and Transportation Company. On 28 June 2003, the City of Spruce Grove granted 1 Svc Bn freedom of the city. The honour was marked with a parade through the city and several static displays of vehicles and equipment. On 6 February 2006, 1 Svc Bn and 1 GS Bn were reunited as a single unit, 1 Svc Bn. On 3 April of the same year, 1 Svc Bn was transferred from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to 1 Area Support Group. On 11 September 2011, the Town of Morinville granted 1 Svc Bn freedom of the city. The honour was marked with a parade through the city and several static displays of vehicles and equipment. On 23 April 2012, 1 Svc Bn returned to the command of 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in accordance with the Canadian Forces Force 2013 laydown. The event was marked with a transfer of command authority parade to formalize the transfer from 1 Area Support Group to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. = Current order of battle = The Unit Headquarters is responsible for command and control of the unit, planning and coordinating support operations and training, issuing direction to the companies, and maintaining liaison with supported and supporting organizations. The unit headquarters includes the Operations Cell, Training Cell, Battalion Orderly Room, and the command team of the commanding officer, the regimental sergeant major, the deputy commanding officer, the adjutant and the battalion administration coordinator. Transportation Company is responsible to provide second- and limited third-line transport and movements support. The second-largest company, it is organized into four platoons: Headquarters Platoon, Field Platoon, C Platoon, and Movements and Postal Platoon. Support tasks executed by the company include the provision of the general cargo and personal transport, refuelling services, snow and ice control operations at CFB Edmonton, multi-modal movements planning and control, aerial resupply and postal services. Additionally, the company provides specialist transportation-related training and manages the conduct of the Canadian Forces Mobile Support Equipment Safety Program in the Edmonton Garrison.LCol (ret) W.P. Dixon, The History of 1 Area Support Group Supply Company is the third-largest company in the battalion. The company is organized with a headquarters and five platoons: the Systems Control Platoon, Stocks Platoon, Garrison Support Services Platoon, Laundry, Bath, and Decontamination Platoon, and Combat Supply Platoon. Supply Company provides a variety of essential stores and services to supported units both in garrison and while on deployed operations. The current Supply Company facility, located within the Edmonton Garrison, was originally conceived and designed in 1996 by officer commanding Supply Company Captain Stewart Campbell. Maintenance Company is the largest of the companies in the battalion. The company provides second- and limited third-line repair and recovery services to assigned dependencies both in garrison and on deployments, as well as providing integral-level support to specified units that do not possess their own integral Land Equipment Management System resources. Maintenance Company consists of the Headquarters, Vehicle Platoon, Artisan Platoon, and Garrison Maintenance Platoon. Administration Company is the smallest in the battalion and is composed of the Headquarters Platoon, Maintenance Platoon, Transport Platoon, Quartermaster Platoon, Signals Troop, and Finance Platoon. The role of Administration Company is to provide efficient and effective first-line support to the other companies of 1 Svc Bn and any external elements that are attached to the unit. This includes the provision of transportation, maintenance, supply, signals, administrative, and food services support that the members of the other companies need in order to successfully carry out their assigned tasks.

The official colours of the unit flag are Marine Corps scarlet and oriental blue with an intervening gold stripe and the number one emblazoned in the centre. These colours have a history of association with army services. The oriental blue colour of the flag is reminiscent of the old RCOC flag while the gold colour can be found on the former banners of the RCASC, the RCEME Corps, and the Royal Canadian Army Pays Corps (RCAPC).  Unit badge  The badge of 1 Svc Bn (seen above) was selected after many years of discussion in 1978. The badge depicts a Dall ram's head against the battalion flag oriented diagonally inside a ceremonial Canadian Forces unit badge. The Dall sheep is indigenous to Alberta and it was selected to represent the \\"Army of the West\\" many years ago by Major General F.F. Worthington.  Unit building  On 15 November 2017, 1 Service Battalion finalized the exterior naming of building 179 with \\" Bell/Slumkofske Building\\". The building is named after two distinguished soldiers: Colonel Bell was a logistician of the First World War and Sergeant Lawrence Albert Slumkofske a RCEME soldier who served in the Second World War. The official naming of building 179 occurred with the unveiling of a dedication plate in the foyer of the building on 20 October 1996 by Major-General M.D. Jeffries CD.

The story begins with Darren Shan and his best friend Steve \\"Leopard\\" Leonard visiting an illegal freak show where an encounter with a vampire and a deadly, unique spider forces them to make life-changing choices that neither of them could have ever thought possible. Throughout the novels Darren is put through sticky situations, trials and tribulations while adjusting to his new life. Darren had no clue what to expect but somehow managed to become an essential character in a world that he just stepped into. As time passes for the young Darren Shan he must learn to live with his new body, appetite, long life span, and world of unknown that he will soon come to discover. The 13 novels are packed with thrilling stories and can appeal to audiences of any age. A feature film adaptation of the novel, directed by Paul Weitz and starring Chris Massoglia, John C. Reilly, Ken Watanabe, Salma Hayek, Josh Hutcherson and Willem Dafoe was released on October 23, 2009. This film was not able to live up to the popularity of the best selling novels but did well in some aspects. It certainly sparked interest to a wider audience but was not able to capture the attention of the diehard fans. A second film was never announced but some are hopeful for a reinstallment of the film to create a movie grounded and true to the novels.

It is located at the square of Mombasa Road, Langata Road and the Aerodrome Road. It is approximately two kilometers from the City Center, directly opposite Nairobi Mega Mall, formerly known as Nakumatt Mega. The stadium was built in 1983 for a capacity of 30,000. It is currently used mostly for football matches. The popular AFC Leopards football club plays most of its home games at Nyayo stadium. The stadium is also used for athletics , swimming and various ceremonies most common of which are National Holiday celebrations. Other facilities at the Nyayo Stadium include a gymnasium and a 50-metre swimming pool. Rugby union club Mwamba RFC used the Nyayo National Stadium for home games. The completion of the Nyayo Stadium gave Kenya the opportunity to be placed in the category of nations that were invited to bid for the 4th All- Africa Games in 1987, a bid that was awarded to Kenya, giving it International status. In essence, the Nyayo Stadium \\"gave birth\\" to Moi International Sports Centre. The Nyayo Stadium was the host venue of the 2010 African Championships in Athletics. The stadium was renamed to the Coca-Cola National Stadium after the multi-national company won the naming rights to the stadium in February 2009. The deal was worth US$1.5 million and would have seen the beverage company do branding, marketing and naming to the whole stadium for three years. Three months later, however, Coca-Cola withdrew from the contract, because the Kenyan government wanted to have the stadium branded as Coca-Cola Nyayo National Stadium. but was renamed again to the Nyayo National Stadium, as the Government of Kenya wanted it branded. This decision has been widely criticised by many Kenyan citizens, because they believe that Coca-Cola would have heavily improved and popularised the stadium. The stadium houses headquarters for the Football Kenya Federation and Athletics Kenya.

Many of the maps of southern Asia which he compiled remained standard for the rest of the 19th century. In 1835, aged twenty-two, he commanded the first steamboat to paddle up the Indus River and surveyed the river as he went.

In addition to the stadium capacity of 36,761 people, there is an auditorium for 200 people, 120 hospitality suites, a gymnasium and a conference centre.Soweto's field of dreams, South Africa.info, 25 June 2009 History The stadium was originally built for the Johannesburg Bantu Football Association and it had a seating capacity of 24,000 and cost £37,500 to construct. It was opened by the Minister for Bantu development, MC de Wet Nel, and Ian Maltz who was then Mayor of Johannesburg on 2 May 1959. Although intended for football the stadium has been used for concerts by the Jazz musicians Molombo and by the O'Jays. Boxing matches were also staged including the 1975 victory of Elijah ‘Tap Tap' Makhathini over the world welterweight and middleweight champion Emile Griffith. On 16 June 1976 thousands of black students marched to Orlando Stadium to protest at having to learn the Afrikaans language. It was intended to be a rally and although it was organised some of the students only joined the protest on the day. It was planned to be a peaceful protest by the Soweto Students’ Representative Council’s (SSRC) Action Committee. The marchers got as far as their last meeting point when the police and tear gas arrived. The day ended in deaths and this was the start of the Soweto Uprising. In 1978 the Orlando Pirates took on Phil Venter who had been the first White National Football Association player to play for a black side. He was soon joined by another white player Keith Broad. In 1995, the stadium played host to the funeral of African National Congress stalwart, Joe Slovo, as well as that of Walter Sisulu in 2003 where Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and Pakalitha Mosisili of Lesotho were among the mourners., Orlando Stadium History, Joburg.org.za, accessed 6 June 2013 In 2011 the stadium hosted the funeral of Albertina Sisulu where Jacob Zuma, Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia were among the mourners, and also hosted the funeral of Winnie Mandela in 2018 where Cyril Ramaphosa, former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe, Jacob Zuma; Hage Geingob of Namibia, Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo-Brazaville and Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana; and Naomi Campbell of Britain were amongst the mourners. In 1994 South Africa became democratic and on the anniversary of the Soweto Uprising Nelson Mandela gave a speech at this stadium where he committed the country to look after its children. From 2008 to 2010 the stadium was rebuilt with a steel frame and this increased the capacity to 36,761 at a cost of 280m Rand. The stadium hosted a Super 14 Rugby union semi-final in 2010, as well as the 2010 Super 14 Final, a week later. This was due to the Bulls' usual home ground Loftus Versfeld Stadium being unavailable, due to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

The band has several releases on the American record label, Metropolis Records. They are named after two Marvel Comics characters. Biography The Dassing brothers first began experimenting with music by the means of more traditional rock music instruments, such as guitar and drums. However, by the time the two formed their first band Benestrophe with vocalist Richard Mendez, the instruments of choice became synthesizers and samplers. Most of the two tapes worth of material they recorded subsequently became available as the releases Sensory Deprivation and Auric Fires on Ras Dva Records. After parting ways with Mendez, the two brothers began work as Mentallo & The Fixer. A friend of Gary's brought the name \\"Mentallo & The Fixer\\" to his attention while still working on Benestrophe. After Benestrophe went dormant, the name resurfaced and, after Gary realized the names referred to two lesser-known comic book characters, the name grew on him. Their first album release No Rest for the Wicked saw a limited 500-copy run on vinyl and a CD by the Portuguese label Simbiose records, and also gained the attention of Talla 2XLC from Zoth Ommog records. Zoth Ommog released their next two major albums, Revelations 23 and Where Angels Fear to Tread. As an American band, working with European labels proved difficult and frustrating due to poor communications and, in the case of the Simbiose releases, a lack of a formal contract. Mentallo & The Fixer soon after began their long-term relationship with the American industrial music record label Metropolis Records with a domestic re-release of their second and third albums as well as a CD of unreleased back catalog material, Continuum. Meanwhile, in 1994, the Dassing brothers formed a side project with vocalist Michael Greene called Mainesthai. Mainesthai's two releases, Out to Lunch and Mentallo & The Fixer Meets Mainesthai were also both released on Metropolis Records, but not until 1998. Michael also participated in Mentallo's first U.S. tour in 1996, joining the band to perform Mainesthai tracks during their live sets. In 1997 Mentallo & The Fixer toured the U.S. for the second time, Europe for the first time, and released their next album Burnt Beyond Recognition, along with two EPs, Centuries and False Prophets. The band's second US tour was initially cut short due to difficulties because of the long duration and because show revenue was unexpectedly low, but the missed tour dates were rescheduled after a break. The European tour in October that year proved to be a much better experience for the band. By 1999, Dwayne and Gary agreed to split in order to pursue their own musical directions. After the departure of Dwayne from the band (aside from some live show support through 2002), Gary continued to use the Mentallo & The Fixer name and released several albums including Algorythum, Love Is the Law, Return to Grimpen Ward, and Vengeance is Mine, along with the EP Systematik Ruin to accompany Alogrythum. After \\"Grimpen\\", Mentallo's album output slowed somewhat, resulting in two albums: Enlightenment Through a Chemical Catalyst in 2007 and Music From the Eather in 2012, both released by Alfa Matrix. In September 2014, Mentallo & the Fixer released a 3 CD box titled Zothera on Alfa Matrix. It contained two remastered albums from their Zoth Ommog era, namely Revelations 23 and Where Angels Fear to Tread, and a third bonus CD Apocrypha with unreleased material including remixes. Another intervening period of dormancy followed, compelled by the crash of Gary's music computer, which he took as a sign to give music a break for a while. After a several year break and a new Apple computer, Gary found the motivation to revive works in progress from data backups and record a new album, Arrange The Molecule, released by Alfa Matrix in 2017. Updates posted to the band's official Facebook page in 2019 showed Gary in the studio, joined by brother Dwayne and occasional collaborator Jon (Jonni) Pyre, working on new material for an as yet unnamed project. The apparent inspiration for this live performance-only project is Tangerine Dream's first live recording from 1975, Ricochet.

Their first song - \\"Pig Butcher\\" - was recorded in the Summer of 1988. Gary and Dwayne composed the music and Rich wrote the lyrics and provided vocals. Benestrophe went idle in 1990 as the Dassing brothers moved to Austin, TX, but reactivated for a time after 1995 with new material and re-releases on RAS DVA records. * Sensory Deprivation – Cassette, Self-released * Red Kross – Cassette (1990) Self-released * Sensory Deprivation – CD Ltd.

Gary answered an ad that Mike had put in a local paper which led to an interview and one-song demo performance that led to a formal collaboration. As was the case with Benestrophe, Gary and Dwayne produced the music and Mike contributed the lyrics and vocals. Mainesthai's sound was similar to Mentallo, but the subject matter was explicitly more political in nature and the music was made with an effort to sound more melodic and, in their words, \\"tribal\\". * Out to Lunch - CD (1994) Zoth Ommog Records * Mentallo & The Fixer Meets Mainesthai – CD (1994) Zoth Ommog Records • CD (1998) Metropolis Records * Body Rapture Vol. 4 – V/A CD track #2 \\"Dollars and Sins\\" (1994) Zoth Ommog Records * We Came to Dance - Indie Dancefloor Vol. VI – V/A CD track #10 \\"Exit (Stage Left)\\" (1994) Sub Terranean * There Is No Time – V/A 4xCD disc #2 track #9 \\"Y (Mama's Crazy Kitchen Mix)\\" (1995) Ras Dva =Parking Lot in Drug Form= This is a Gary Dassing and Ric Laciak project recorded while Ric stayed with Gary during a two-week visit to Austin, TX. * There Is No Time – V/A 4xCD disc #4 track #15 \\"Step Away\\" (1995) Ras Dva * AP: The Contest – V/A CD track #14 \\"So Cold\\" (1995) Zoth Ommog Records =Shimri= Gary Dassing solo project. * Lilies of the Field – CD (2000) Artoffact Records =Reign of Roses= Dwayne & Gary Dassing with vocals and lyrics by Scott Berens * In Bourbon and in Blood – CDr (2006) Self- released =Kitty Kosmonaut= Dwayne Dassing with John Bustamante of Fektion Fekler * Kitty Kosmonaut - CD, Digital (2015) Re:Mission Entertainment References External links * Mentallo & The Fixer's Metropolis Records Page   Musical groups established in 1988 1988 establishments in Texas American electro-industrial music groups Musical groups from San Antonio Metropolis Records artists Zoth Ommog Records artists ","title":"Mentallo and the Fixer"},{"id":"4031686","text":"Stade Mohamed Hamlaoui () is a multi-use stadium in Constantine, Algeria.

He is from Stratford, Connecticut and has a 649-437 career record. As a college athlete, Penders played both basketball and baseball for the University of Connecticut, and is one of the few players to have competed in both the NCAA Tournament as well as the College World Series.http://www.uhcougars.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/penders_tom00.html Prior to his last job as Houston's head coach, Penders was a sports analyst for ESPN and Westwood One Radio.http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5018573 He also has been the head coach for Tufts, Columbia, Fordham, Rhode Island, Texas, and George Washington. Coaching career =High school= Penders posted a 59-10 record as a high school coach at Bullard-Havens Tech and Bridgeport Central High School in Connecticut. He led Bullard-Havens to a 14-6 record in his first season as a head coach. The next year, he guided Bridgeport Central to a 23-2 record and a number two ranking in the state. The following year, he was named the New York Daily News Coach of the Year after leading Bridgeport to a 20-1 mark and Number one ranking. =Tufts, Columbia, Fordham= Penders began his collegiate coaching career at Tufts University in 1971, and compiled a 54-18 record in three seasons. On October 6, 2006, Penders and his 1972-73 Tufts team were inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame. Next Penders coached for four seasons at Columbia University. In his final two years there, Penders led the school to back-to- back winning seasons. After Columbia, Penders moved to Fordham University where he remained for eight years and compiled a 125-114 record. In 1980-81, Penders was named the New York Metropolitan Area Coach of the Year after leading Fordham to a 19-9 record. On January 26, 2013, Penders was inducted into the Fordham Athletic Hall of Fame. =Rhode Island= Penders took over Rhode Island’s program on October 4, 1986, two weeks before the regular season began. He was named the Atlantic 10 Conference Co-Coach of the Year after guiding the Rams to a 20-10 record and a berth into the NIT his first year. In 1988, Penders led the Rams to the 1988 NCAA Sweet 16 with wins over Missouri and Syracuse before eventually losing to Duke. =Texas= In his 10 seasons at the University of Texas, Penders compiled a 208-110 record. During his time there, he became the winningest basketball coach in school history (although now passed by former Texas and now Tennessee coach Rick Barnes). He led the Longhorns to three Southwest Conference championships and eight NCAA Tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight in 1990, and the Sweet 16 in 1997. His teams at Texas averaged 20.8 wins per season, 87.2 points per game, and forced 19 turnovers per contest. When Penders was hired in 1988, he inherited a team that won 16 games the year before; the Erwin Center (the Longhorns' home court) averaged 4,028 fans per game (in a 16,231-seat arena). Immediately after his arrival, Penders switched to a more uptempo offense, and called his team the \\"Runnin' Horns.\\" His first team finished second in the Southwest Conference and earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Longhorns also set 22 school and SWC records while more than doubling their attendance average to 10,011 per game, the largest increase in NCAA Division I. In his final year at Texas, Penders underwent heart surgery and was unable to coach the first few games of what would end up being a tumultuous season.https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/sports/plus-college-basketball- texas-penders-recovering-after-heart-surgery.html His tenuous departure from Texas was the subject of a book, Burned Orange by Kyle Dalton.Amazon.com =George Washington= Penders served as head coach at the George Washington University from 1998–2001, where he compiled a 49–42 record and led the Colonials to the NCAA Tournament. =Houston= Penders came to Houston after spending three years as an analyst for ESPN and Westwood One Radio. In his first season at the University of Houston, Penders guided the Cougars to the nation’s fourth-best turnaround with an 18–14 overall record and Houston led the nation in turnover margin and set both team and individual school records for most three-point field goals made in a season. In his second season, Penders led the Cougars to their first 20-win season, first back-to-back winning seasons, and first back-to-back postseason tournament appearances since 1992–93. He also led Houston to back-to-back wins over nationally ranked teams for the first time since the 1984 NCAA Midwest Regional Tournament and their first postseason tournament victory since 1988 in his first two years at the school, in the NIT. Houston finished the 2005-06 campaign with a 2–2 record against nationally ranked teams after beating No. 25 LSU on November 29 and 13th-ranked Arizona December 3 in a nationally televised game on ESPN2. Houston’s postseason tournament victory was against BYU in the first round of the 2006 NIT. It also was Penders’ first career victory in the NIT. Houston led the nation in steals with a 12.4 average, and the Cougars finished second in turnover margin with an average margin of +7.5. Penders led the Houston Cougars to the Conference USA championship game in 2010 where they defeated UTEP for their first NCAA Tournament berth in 18 years. This made him only the 8th coach to take 4 different schools to the NCAA tournament. Penders resigned as coach of Houston on March 22, 2010 following a first round loss to Maryland in the NCAA tournament.  College playing career Penders played both baseball and basketball at the University of Connecticut, where he starred as a center fielder for the baseball team and a point guard for the basketball team from 1964-67. Family In addition to Tom and Tommy, Jr. serving as basketball coaches, his father was a longtime baseball coach at Stratford High School from 1931–68, and led the school to four state championships. His brother, Jim, is the baseball coach at East Catholic High School, and was named the national high school Coach of the Year in 1996. Like his father, Jim Penders won four state championships. His two nephews also are collegiate baseball coaches. Jim was named the head coach at Connecticut in 2003 after serving seven years as an assistant coach and playing four years for the Huskies. Rob serves as the head baseball coach at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas.

Nevelson grew up in Florence, Italy, and began painting at the age of two. She spent her childhood in Florence and New York City, and as a teenager moved to New York, to live at her grandmother's studio. She has lived in Coconut Grove in Southern Florida, since 1977. Nevelson studied briefly at the Accademia di Belle Arti, in Florence, Italy. As a student she concentrated on subjects she eventually became known for rather than the standard curriculum of still life drawings and landscapes, and was eventually expelled. Her first exhibition was in 1974 at the Galleria Nuova in Florence. Her last was in 1994; the catalog and exhibition were entitled, \\"Neith Nevelson: In the Middle of the Night\\", by Wendy Blazier.American Artist Neith Nevelson She was influenced by Cubism, Surrealism, and Expressionism. Some art-critics have labeled Nevelson as “Outsider” artist. Nevelson's early work, which she has continued to experiment and embellish on to the present day, take the form of line drawings. Her style developed into complex paintings based on the gestural fluidity of drawing, underscored by her larger art-works which tend to combine elements of all her three major themes. As described in \\"Neith Nevelson: In the Middle of the Night,\\" Neith's paintings are visions from her imagination, and explore the figurative, symbolic and narrative. As described by the Miami Herald's lackluster review of the same 1994 exhibition, the form of her art reflects the conflicts and contradictions of her life, living in the world of her famous grandmother and the New York art world of the 1960s, hardship and isolation from family, and remembering and longing for childhood. She is the illustrator a forthcoming book of poems tentatively titled, \\"Day's Night\\" by Jorge Reyes.The Art of Neith Nevelson Outside of her artistic endeavors, Nevelson is notable for political involvement in the area of abortion advocacy, for which she was jailed in Florence Italy in 1977 along with a group of advocates from the Radical Party, a left wing activist group still active in Europe. In 2009, Neith's life was the basis of the TV show \\"Caso Cerrado\\" with Ana María Polo, broadcast daily in the US by the Telemundo Network.

About the same age as Piazzetta, and an elder contemporary of Tiepolo, he represents a late version of the vigorous and luminous Cortonesque style of grand manner fresco painting. The Adoration of the Kings, 1726 (Royal Collection) The Prodigal Son The Miraculous Draught of Fishes, c. 1695–97, oil on canvas, The Detroit Institute of Arts 1687 Palazzo Farnese, Piacenza He was the uncle of Marco Ricci (1676 – 1730), who trained with him, and became an innovator in landscape painting. Medoro and Angelica (circa 1716) Brukenthal National Museum Triumph of the Marine Venus left  Early years  He was born in Belluno, the son of Andreana and Livio Ricci. In 1671, he was apprenticed to Federico Cervelli of Venice. Others claim Ricci's first master was Sebastiano Mazzoni. In 1678, a youthful indiscretion led to an unwanted pregnancy, and ultimately to a greater scandal, when Ricci was accused of attempting to poison the young woman in question to avoid marriage. He was imprisoned, and released only after the intervention of a nobleman, probably a Pisani family member. He eventually married the mother of his child in 1691, although this was a stormy union. Following his release he moved to Bologna, where he lived near the Parish of San Michele del Mercato. His painting style there was apparently influenced by Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. On 28 September 1682 he was contracted by the \\"Fraternity of Saint John of Florence\\" to paint a Decapitation of John the Baptist for their oratory. On 9 December 1685, the Count of San Segundo near Parma commissioned from Ricci the decoration of the Oratory of the Madonna of the Seraglio, which he completed in collaboration of Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena by October 1687, receiving a payment of 4,482 Lira. In 1686, the Duke Ranuccio II Farnese of Parma commissioned s Pietà for a new Capuchin convent. In 1687-8 Ricci decorated the apartments of the Parmense Duchess in Piacenza with canvases recounting the life of the Farnese pope, Paul III. Turin and return to Venice Venus and AdonisApparently in 1688, Ricci abandoned his wife and daughter, and fled from Bologna to Turin with Magdalen, the daughter of the painter Giovanni Peruzzini. He was again imprisoned, and nearly executed, but was eventually freed by the intercession of the Duke of Parma. The duke employed him and assigned him a monthly salary of 25 crowns and lodging in the Farnese palace in Rome. In 1692, he was commissioned to copy the Coronation of Charlemagne by Raphael in Vatican City, on behalf of Louis XIV, a task he finished only by 1694. The death of the Duke Ranuccio in December, 1694, who was also his protector, forced Ricci to abandon Rome for Milan, where by November 1695 he completed frescoes in the Ossuary Chapel of the Church of San Bernardino dei Morti. On 22 June 1697, the Count Giacomo Durini hired him to paint in the Cathedral of Monza. In 1698, he returned to the Venetian republic for a decade. By 24 August 1700, he had frescoed the chapel of the Santissimo Sacramento in the church of Santa Giustina of Padua. In 1701, the Venetian geographer Vincenzo Coronelli commissioned a canvas of the Ascension that was inserted into the ceiling of sacristy of the Basilica of the Santi Apostoli in Rome. In 1702, he frescoed the ceiling of the Blue Hall in the Schönbrunn Palace, with the Allegory of the Princely Virtues and Love of Virtue, which illustrated the education and dedication of future emperor Joseph I. In Vienna, Frederick August II, the elector Saxony, requested an Ascension canvas, in part to convince others of the sincerity of his conversion to Catholicism, which allowed him to become the King of Poland. In Venice in 1704 he executed a canvas of San Procolo (Saint Proculus) for the Dome of Bergamo and a Crucifixion for the Florentine church of San Francisco de Macci. Florentine frescoes In the summer of 1706, he traveled to Florence, where he completed a work that is by many considered his masterpieces. During his Florentine stay he first completed a large fresco series on allegorical and mythological themes for the now-called Marucelli-Fenzi or Palazzo Fenzi (now housing departments of University of Florence). After this work, Ricci, along with the quadraturista Giuseppe Tonelli, was commissioned by the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici to decorate rooms in the Pitti Palace, where his Venus takes Leave from Adonis contains heavenly depictions that are airier and brighter than prior Florentine fresco series. These works gained him fame and requests from foreign lands and showed the rising influence of Venetian painting into other regions of Italy. He was to influence the Florentine Rococo fresco painter Giovanni Domenico Ferretti. In 1708 he returned to Venice, completing a Madonna with the Child for San Giorgio Maggiore. In 1711, now painting alongside his nephew, Marco Ricci, he painted two canvases: Esther to Assuero and Moses saved from the Nile, for the Taverna Palace. Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs, circa 1705. (High Museum of Art) London and Paris The apse of the chapel, Royal Hospital Chelsea, showing Ricci's painting of the Resurrection c.1710-15 Diana and Her Dog He ultimately accepted foreign patronage in London, when he was provided a £770 commission by Lord Burlington for eight canvases, to be completed by him and his nephew Marco, depicting mythological frolics: Cupid and Jove, Bacchus meets Ariadne, Diana and Nymphs, Bacchus and Ariadne, Venus and Cupid, Diane and Endymion, and a Cupid and Flora. Bacchus and Ariadne He decorated the chapel at Bulstrode House near Gerrards Cross for Henry Bentinck, 1st Duke of Portland with a cycle of wall-paintings depicting scenes from the life of Christ. George Vertue described the scheme as \\"a Noble free invention. great force of lights and shade, with variety & freedom, in the composition of the parts\\". The chapel was demolished in the 19th century, but oil modelli still exist. Ricci also designed stained glass for the Duke of Chandos' chapel at Cannons. In c.1710-15 Ricci painted the apse in the chapel at the Royal Hospital Chelsea of the resurrection. By the end of 1716, with his nephew, he left England for Paris, where he met Watteau, and submitted his Triumph of the Wisdom over Ignorance in order to gain admission to the Royal French Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which was granted on 18 May 1718. He returned to Venice in 1718 a wealthy man, and bought comfortable lodgings in the Old Procuratory of St. Mark. That same year, the Riccis decorated the villa of Giovanni Francesco Bembo in Belvedere, near Belluno. In 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned to contribute a painting on canvas of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme at the church of St Stae in Venice. The other artists involved included Tiepolo, Piazetti, and Pellegrini. Vision der Hl. Therese von Avila Kunsthistorisches Museum Last years From 1724–9, Ricci worked intensely for the Royal House of Savoy in Turin: In 1724 he painted the Rejection of Agar and the Silenus adores the Idols, in 1725, the Madonna in Gloria, in Turin in 1726, he completed the Susanna presented to Daniel and Moses causes water to gush from the rock. In October 1727 he was admitted to the Clementine Academy of Venice. Ricci's style developed a following among other Venetian artists, influencing Francesco Polazzo, Gaspare Diziani, Francesco Migliori, Gaetano Zompini, and Francesco Fontebasso (1709–1769). He died in Venice on 15 May 1734. Veronese copies Fake portrait of Palladio attributed to Veronese, frontispiece to The Architecture of A. Palladio, 1715, engraved by Bernard Picart after Ricci Ricci made many copies from the works of Paolo Veronese, both of individual heads and of whole compositions. Some of these copies of heads were bought by George III. The king also bought a painting of the Finding of Moses which his agent, Joseph Smith, claimed was a Veronese, although this too had been painted by Ricci, either as a pastiche of Veronese's style, or a copy of a work now lost. Ricci painted a supposed portrait of Andrea Palladio, attributed to Veronese and engraved by Bernard Picart for the frontispiece of the first English edition (1715) of Palladio's Four Books of Architecture. According to Rudolf Wittkower, it does not depict Palladio, but rather is entirely the invention of Ricci.Nash 1999, pp. 1347–1349; Wittkower 1974, p. 82, cited by Nash. Critical assessments \\"Ricci, leaning at first on the example of splendid art of the Veronese, made a new ideal prevail, one of clear and rich coloristic beauty: in this he paved the way for Tiepolo. The painting of figures of the Roccoco to Venice remains incomprehensible in its evolution without Ricci... Tiepolo germinated the work started by Ricci to such a richness and splendor that it leaves Ricci in the shadows... although Sebastiano is recognized in the combative role of forerunner \\"(Derschau). \\"He is the master of a resurrected-fifteenth century style, whose painterly features are enriched with nervous express and, typically 17th century\\" (Rudolf Wittkower). Wittkower in his Anthology, contrasts the facile luminous style of Ricci with the darker, more emotional intense painting of Piazzetta. Like Tiepolo, Ricci was an international artist; Piazzetta was local. \\"We perceive in him that synthesis of the baroque decorativeness and individualized and substantial painting, that we will see later again in Tiepolo. On one side the influence of Cortona, directed and indirect, and on the other the observant painting of the hermit Magnasco; more intense, substantial and freed academic impulses, the airy, shining influences become, to the open air, magical coves, as well as gloomy corners. A new synthesis that opened wide new painting horizons, even if the scene is not that of a ballet, it is felt like bing in the wonders of the color, in more vibrating, acute, agile accents \\"(Moschini). \\"At the start of the Baroque..Venetians remained isolated from the outside…from the great ideas of the baroque painting… The Ricci are the first traveling Venetian painters... and succeed to inaugurate the so-called roccoco rooms of Pitti and Marucelli palaces.\\"(Roberto Longhi). Ricci \\"brought back in the Venetian tradition a wealth of chromatic expression resolved in a new vibrating brilliance brightness…by means of the intelligent interpretation of the Veronese chromatics and of the brushstrokes of a Magnasco-like touch, from the 16th century impediments, he takes unfashionable positions against \\"tenebrous styles\\", is against the new Piazzetta – Federico Bencovich. He supplied a valid painterly idiom for ... Tiepolo to use after his defection from the Piazzettism \\"(Pallucchini). \\"Venice, still more than Naples, collects the Ricci inheritance of the prodigioso trade of Luca Giordano... Sebastiano throws again it, widens he then, refines it for the school of Sebastiano Mazzoni \\"(Argan) thumb Venus and Satyr (between 1659 and 1734) Allegory with Figures of Hope, Time, and Death (between 1659 and 1734) Works *Portrait of a Bishop, Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum, Insbruck *Mercy (1686), New Church of the Capuchins, Parma *Frescoes in collaboration with Bibiena, (1687) Sacristy of the Fallen in Church of Santo Segundo, Parma *History and Apotheosis of Paul III (1687–1688), Farnese Palace, now Pinacoteca Civica, Piacenza *Guardian Angel (1694), Chiesa del Carmine, Pavia *Frescoes (1695), Church of San Bernardino alle Ossa, Milan *Ecstasy of St Francis (ca 1695–96), Tweed Museum of Art, Duluth, Minnesota *Last Supper (ca 1720), Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas *Frescoes(1697), Duomo of Monza *Communion of St Maria Egiziaca (1698), Archconfraternity of the Duomo of the Santa Sindone, Milan *St Gregory the Great intercedes with Madonna (1700), Church of Santa Giustina, Padua *Frescoes (1700), Church of Santa Giustina, Padua *Ascension (1701), Santi Apostoli, Rome *Allegory of the princely virtues (1702), Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna *Assumption of Virgin (1702) Gemäldegalerie, Dresden *Crucifixion with Virgin, John the Evangelist and Carlo Borromeo (1704), Uffizi, Florence *Procolo, Peasant Detention (1704), Duomo, Bergamo) *Vision of St. Bruno (1705) *Frescoes (1706–1707), Palazzi Fenzi Marucelli & Pitti, Florence *Madonna with Child (1708), San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice) *Family of Darius before Alexander & Continence of Scipio (ca 1709), North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh *Liberation of Saint Peter (1710), Trescore Balneario, Bergamo, church of Saint Peter)(San Stae) *Christ giving the keys to St Peter & Call of St Peter (1710), San Pietro, Bergamo *Assumption (1710), Santa Maria Maggiore, Bergamo) *Esther before Ahasuerus (1711), Palazzo Taverna, Rome *Moses saved from the waters (1711) *Sacred Family with Elizabeth and John (1712), Royal Collections, London *Frescoes for Burlington House (1712–1714), London **Cupid before Jove; Encounter of Bacchus and Ariadne; and Triumph of Galatea *Frescoes for Chiswick House (1712–14), London **Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery) **Venus and Cupid, Diana and Endymion, Cupid and Flora, and Diana and Nymphs *Selene & Endymion (1713), London *The Resurrection (1714), Royal Hospital Chelsea, London *Triumph of Wisdom over Ignorance (1718), Louvre, Paris *Head of Woman (1718), fresco fragment, Civic Museum, Belluno *Bathsheba at her Bath (1724), Szépművészeti Múzeum, Budapest *Sabauda Gallery, Turin **Repudiation of Agar and Solomon adores the Idols (1724) **Madonna in Glory with archangel Gabriel and Saints Eusebio, Sebastiano & Rocco (1725) **Susanna in front of Daniel and Moses make water gush from the rock (1726) **Magdalen applies ointment to Christ's feet (1728) *Apotheosis of Saint Sebastian (circa 1725), Musée des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg *St Cajetan heals the Sick (1727), Brera Gallery, Milan *Ecstasy of St. Teresa, (1727, Church of St Jerome (now St Mark), Vicenza) *Royal Palace, Turin **Hagar in the desert; Jacob blesses the sons of Joseph; Moses saved from waters; and Rebecca and Eliazer at the well (1727) *Christ and the Centurions and Wedding at Cannae, (1729), Capodimonte Museum, Naples *Communion and Martyrdom of St Lucia (1730), Church of Santa Lucia, Parma *Immaculate Conception (1730), Church of San Vitale, Venice *Madonna in Glory with Child and Angel Guardian, (1730) Scuola of the Guardian Angel, Venice *Prayer in Garden, (1730), Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna *Self-portrait (1731), Uffizi Gallery *Pope Gregory the Great intercedes with Virgin (1731), Sant'Alessandro della Croce, Bergamo *Pope Gregory the Great intercedes for souls in Purgatory, (1733), Saint Gervais, Paris *Pope Pio V, Saints Thomas Acquinus, & Peter Martyr (1733), Gesuati, Venice *St Francis from resuscitates child Paola and St Helen discovers True Cross, San Rocco Church, Venice *Baldassarre and Ester before Ahasuerus (1733), Quirinal Palace, Rome *Assumption (1734) Karlskirche, Vienna References Sources *Free translation from Italian Wikipedia entry  Nash, Paul W.; Savage, Nicholas (1999).

This brought the total number of schools offering free education to the city's children to seven, as the Freedman's Bureau had established two schools for black children in 1866. = Integration = On August 30, 1961, nine students – Thomas Franklin Welch, Madelyn Patricia Nix, Willie Jean Black, Donita Gaines, Arthur Simmons, Lawrence Jefferson, Mary James McMullen, Martha Ann Holmes and Rosalyn Walton – became the first African American students to attend several of APS's all- white high schools. On September 8, 1961, Time magazine reported: > Last week the moral siege of Atlanta (pop. 487,455) ended in spectacular > fashion with the smoothest token school integration ever seen in the Deep > South. Into four high schools marched nine Negro students without so much as > a white catcall. Teachers were soon reporting \\"no hostility, no > demonstrations, the most normal day we've ever had.\\" In the lunchrooms, > white children began introducing themselves to Negro children. At Northside > High, a biology class was duly impressed when Donita Gaines, a Negro, was > the only student able to define the difference between anatomy and > physiology. Said she crisply: \\"Physiology has to do with functions.\\" In a 1964 news story, Time would say, \\"The Atlanta decision was a gentle attempt to accelerate one of the South’s best-publicized plans for achieving integration without revolution.\\" By May 1961, 300 transfer forms had been given to black students interested in transferring out of their high schools. 132 students actually applied; of those, 10 were chosen and 9 braved the press, onlookers, and insults to integrate Atlanta's all-white high schools. Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka had established the right of African American students to have equal opportunities in education, but it was not until 1958, when a group of African American parents challenged the segregated school system in federal court, that integration became a tangible reality for students of color in Atlanta. Adding to the accolades for the students and the city, President Kennedy publicly congratulated residents during an evening address and asked other cities to \\"look closely at what Atlanta has done and to meet their responsibility... with courage, tolerance and above all, respect for the law.\\" In 2012, Atlanta Public Schools produced a documentary to honor the 50th anniversary of the district's desegregation efforts. In January 1972, in order to settle several federal discrimination and desegregation lawsuits filed on behalf of minority students, faculty, and employees and reach satisfactory agreement with Atlanta civil rights leaders who had worked over a decade for a peaceful integration plan. Atlanta Public Schools entered into a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, with approval and oversight from the U.S. Department of Education, in an attempt to desegregate Atlanta Public Schools. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a majority of Atlanta Northside public schools had either token integration, or none at all. Faculty and staff assignments to schools had remained mostly segregated as well. The justice department allowed the school system to create and use a plan consisting of partial district busing; voluntary and \\"M to M\\" (minority to majority) transfers; redrawing attendance zones; closing outdated and underutilized schools; building new schools; and mandating and implementing equal employment opportunity guidelines for hiring, training, promotion, assignment, vendor selection, bidding, contracting, construction, procurement and purchasing. The school system was also converted from a K-7 elementary and 8-12 high school grade system into a middle school 6–8 grade program beginning with the 1973/1974 school year. The curriculum was also updated to have studies more balanced, inclusive, and diverse, with content culturally and historically significant to racial minorities. With strict guidelines, oversight and timeline implementation of the voluntary desegregation plan, the federal courts agreed not to order and enforce system- wide a mandatory busing desegregation program for APS that had been federally enforced in other cities up to that time, most notably Boston and Philadelphia which resulted in widespread anti-busing violence in 1973-74 that Atlanta civil rights leaders desired to avoid. Along with this program for racial balance, the school system's first African American Superintendent, Dr. Alonzo A. Crim, took over leadership of Atlanta Public Schools in August 1973. He remained superintendent until his retirement in 1988. =21st century= The City of Atlanta, in 2017, agreed to annex territory in DeKalb County, including the Centers for Disease Control and Emory University, effective January 1, 2018. In 2016 Emory University made a statement that \\"Annexation of Emory into the City of Atlanta will not change school districts, since neighboring communities like Druid Hills will still be self-determining regarding annexation.\\" By 2017 the city agreed to include the annexed property in the boundaries of APS, a move decried by the leadership of the DeKalb County School District as it would take taxable property away from that district. In 2017 the number of children living in the annexed territory who attended public schools was nine. The area ultimately went to APS; students in the area will be rezoned to APS effective 2024; they will be zoned to DeKalb schools before then. Cheating scandal During the 11-year tenure of former superintendent Beverly Hall, the APS experienced unusually high gains in standardized test scores, such as the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test. In 2009, Hall won the National Superintendent of the Year Award. Around this time, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution began investigating the score increases and suggested evidence of cheating. A state report found numerous erased answers in an analysis of the 2009 test scores. Tests were administered under much higher scrutiny in 2010, and the scores dropped dramatically. The state of Georgia launched a major investigation as cheating concerns intensified. The investigation's report, published in July 2011, found evidence of a widespread cheating scandal. At least 178 teachers and principals at 44 APS schools were alleged to have corrected students' tests to increase scores, in some cases holding \\"cheating parties\\" to revise large quantities of tests. Hall, who had retired in June 2011, expressed regret but denied any prior knowledge of, or participation in, the cheating. The new superintendent, Erroll Davis, demanded the resignation of the 178 APS employees or else they would be fired. The revelation of the scandal left many Atlantans feeling outraged and betrayed, with Mayor Kasim Reed calling it \\"a dark day for the Atlanta public school system.\\" The scandal attracted national media coverage.

Career Buckley's broadcasting career began in 1982. While working as a newspaper reporter in his native West Midlands, he was chosen from thousands of hopefuls to present the consumer programme, That's Life!, on BBC1 with Esther Rantzen. His mother had entered him for the job without his knowing. After three years, he left That's Life! to become a reporter for the BBC's Holiday programme, and spent the next six years travelling the world. Other TV appearances include Call My Bluff, Blankety Blank, All Star Secrets, Songs of Praise, Children in Need, and a variety of regional work in the south for Meridian Television on subjects as diverse as consumer affairs, politics and amateur film-making. From 1989, he has also presented daily radio shows for numerous commercial and BBC stations in the South, The Midlands, London, Manchester and now in Plymouth. Buckley's acting experience includes playing Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat at Leatherhead. He also toured in the black comedy Widow's Weeds, and starred in numerous pantomimes, playing King in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal, Brighton. He was also an extra in the Birmingham-based soap opera Crossroads. On hearing of the sacking of one of the programme's leading cast members Noele Gordon, Bill led a campaign outside the studios of Crossroads' producer ATV in Birmingham demanding her reinstatement and performed a protest song entitled \\"Meg is Magic\\". The song was soon launched as a record. He also provided the words and music for Su Pollard's number two hit single, \\"Starting Together\\" which featured as the signature tune for the BBC Television documentary The Marriage in 1986 Beginning in 1997, Buckley was senior continuity announcer for Channel 5 Television from its launch for five-and-a-half years. He became well known for his commentary over the closing credits of the channel's late-night/early- morning run of Prisoner: Cell Block H, on which he read out viewers' letters and made comments about the episode just broadcast.

It is derived from the prepronociceptin protein, as are a further 2 peptides, nocistatin & NocII, which inhibit the N/OFQ receptor function. Nociceptin itself acts as a potent anti-analgesic, effectively counteracting the effect of pain-relievers. The gene coding for prepronociceptin is located on Ch8p21 in humans. Nociceptin acts at the Nociceptin receptor (NOP receptor) formerly known as ORL1. Nociceptin is the first example of reverse pharmacology; the NOP receptor was discovered before the endogenous ligand which was discovered by two separate groups in 1995.  Roles of Nociceptin  Since its discovery, nociceptin has been of great interest to researchers. Nociceptin is a peptide related to the opioid class of compounds (ex. morphine and codeine), but it does not act at the classic opioid receptors (namely, mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) which typically act as pain relievers. Nociceptin is widely distributed in the CNS; it is found in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and forebrain, as well as in the ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord. The NOP receptor is also widely distributed throughout areas of the brain, including the cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, central gray, pontine nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, raphe complex, locus coeruleus, and spinal cord. = Pain = The N/OFQ-NOP system is found in central and peripheral nervous tissue, where it is well placed to modulate nociception, or the body's sensation of pain. Unlike morphine and other opioids that are used to alleviate pain, nociceptin's role in nociception is not straightforward. Administration of N/OFQ in the brain causes increased sensations of pain (hyperalgesia). This makes it unique from classic opioid peptides, which typically act as analgesics (pain relievers), as it means that nociceptin can even counteract analgesia, thus acting as an antiopioid. Additionally, blocking the nociceptin receptor can lead to an increased pain threshold and a decreased tolerance development to analgesic opioids. As such, nociceptin has a lower risk of addiction than many pain relievers that are currently used. Recent studies have proposed that this anti-analgesic function of nociceptin stems from the inhibition of the periaqueductal grey, which controls pain modulation from the central nervous system. This effect of nociceptin may lead to its future use as a method to reduce morphine dosage and decrease the development of tolerance and dependence. When administered to the spinal cord, nociceptin produces similar analgesic effects to classical opioids. =Mood Disorders= There are various studies on animals that suggest that the N/OFQ- NOP system has a part to play in both anxiety and depression. It appears that nociceptin is an anxiolytic (anxiety inhibitor) but also seems to perpetuate depression, since preventing N/OFQ from binding to NOP seems to improve depression. = Drug Abuse Medications = The NOP receptor has shown potential as a target for medications designed to alleviate the effects of substance abuse disorders. Areas in the hypothalamus and amygdala that correlate to the reward process of drug abuse have been found to contain NOP receptors. Nociceptin has also been found to inhibit dopamine production related to the reward process. Specifically, nociceptin acts to inhibit neural rewards induced by drugs such as amphetamines, morphine, cocaine, and especially alcohol in animal models, though the exact mechanism of this has not yet been proven. Additionally, nociceptin may have lower tolerance development than drugs such as morphine. This was shown when nociceptin compounds were used as a pain medication substitution for morphine. Nociceptin also has therapeutic capabilities for addictions to multiple drugs, potentially playing a role in compounds that have decreased withdrawal tendencies (such as muscle aches, anxiety, and restlessness). = Learning and Memory = In animal studies, the N/OFQ-NOP receptor pathway has also been found to play both positive and negative roles in both learning and memory. For example, malfunctions in this pathway are linked to altered fear learning in brain disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As such, the receptor pathway maintains homeostatic responses to fear and stressful situations. Nociceptin could also play an inhibitory role in memory function, as some studies show that it impairs spatial learning in vivo, while inhibiting long term potentiation and synaptic transmission in vitro. =Cardiovascular System= The N/OFQ-NOP system has also been implicated in control of the cardiovascular system, as nociceptin administration has led to high blood pressure and bradycardia. Nociceptin has significant effects on cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate that vary by species, as it is excitatory for rodents yet inhibitory for sheep. = Renal System = In the renal system, nociceptin plays a role in water balance, electrolyte balance, and arterial blood pressure regulation. It has also shown potential as a diuretic treatment for alleviating water-retaining diseases. = Immune System = Additional research suggests that nociceptin may be involved in the immune system and sepsis. A study at the University of Leicester looked at patients who were critically ill with sepsis and found that blood N/OFQ levels were significantly higher in patients who died within thirty days in comparison to survivors. = Digestive System = In the gut, nociceptin has been found to have varying effects on stomach and intestinal contractility while also stimulating the increased consumption of food. Additional studies have shown that nociceptin may have an effect as an anti- epileptic drug component.

With a high level of social inhibition, situations are avoided because of the possibility of others disapproving of their feelings or expressions. Social inhibition is related to behavior, appearance, social interactions, or a subject matter for discussion. Related processes that deal with social inhibition are social evaluation concerns, anxiety in social interaction, social avoidance, and withdrawal. Also related are components such as cognitive brain patterns, anxious apprehension during social interactions, and internalizing problems. It also describes those who suppress anger, restrict social behavior, withdraw in the face of novelty, and have a long latency to interact with strangers. Individuals can also have a low level of social inhibition, but certain situations may generally cause people to be more or less inhibited. Social inhibition can sometimes be reduced by the short-term use of drugs including alcohol or benzodiazepines. Major signs of social inhibition in children are cessation of play, long latencies to approaching the unfamiliar person, signs of fear and negative affect, and security seeking. Also in high level cases of social inhibition, other social disorders can emerge through development, such as social anxiety disorder and social phobia. Background Social inhibition can range from normal reactions to social situations to a pathological level, associated with psychological disorders like social anxiety or social phobia. Life events are important and are related to our well-being and inhibition levels. In a lab study conducted by Buck and colleagues, social inhibition in everyday life was reviewed. Researchers observed how individuals interacted and communicated about different stimuli. In this study, there were female participants called \\"senders\\" who viewed twelve emotionally loaded stimuli. There were also participants in the study called \\"received\\" who had to guess which stimuli was viewed by the senders. The senders were either alone, with a friend, or with a stranger while viewing the slides. The results of the study revealed that being with a stranger had inhibitory effects on communication, whereas being with a friend had facilitative effects with some stimuli and inhibitory effects with others. The results show how anyone can be inhibited in daily life, with strangers or even friends. Inhibition can also be determined by one's sensitivity levels to different social cues throughout the day. Gable and colleagues conducted a study in which they examined different events participants would record at the end of their day. Participants were also measured on the behavioral activation system and the behavioral inhibition system. The results revealed that individuals with more sensitivity on the behavioral inhibition system reported having more negative effects from daily events. Expression can also be inhibited or suppressed because of anxiety to social situations or simple display rules. Yarczower and Daruns' study about social inhibition of expression defined inhibition of expression as a suppression of one's facial behavior in the presences of someone or a perceived anxious situation. They addressed the display rules we all learn as children; we are told what expressions are suitable for what situations. Then as age increases we are socialized into not expressing strong facial emotions. However, leaving the face with a reduced expression hinders communication. In turn this makes the face a less reliable social cue during social interactions. Friedmen and Miller-Herringer bring these nonverbal expressions to the next level by studying individuals that have a greater level of emotional suppression. They state that without proper emotional expression social interactions can be much more difficult because others may not understand another individual's emotional state. This being said, there are also four commonly seen irrational cognitive patterns involved in social inhibition. The first pattern centers on self-esteem and perfectionism. In these cases, an individual would inhibit themselves though self-criticism; they want to do everything the \\"right\\" way. The second pattern deals with unrealistic approval needs; here individuals want to gain the approval of others and will fear rejection if they express too much. In the third pattern, unrealistic labeling of aggressive and assertive behavior depicts how many individuals that inhibit themselves may feel as though aggression or assertiveness is bad. They believe if they express these behaviors they will receive a negative label. The last pattern discusses criticism of others, this pattern is a spin-off from the first. They will be highly critical of others much like they are to themselves. Shyness is another factor that is a part of social inhibition. Shyness is associated with low emotional regulations and high negative emotions. In many cases shy individuals have a greater change of social inhibition. Although social inhibition is a common part of life, individuals can also have high levels of inhibition. Social Inhibition on higher levels can sometimes be a precursor to disorders such as Social Anxiety Disorder. Essex and colleagues found that some early risk factors may play a role in having chronically high inhibition. In this study, mothers, teachers, and the child reported on the child's behavioral inhibition. The factors that were found to be contributors to social inhibition were female gender, exposure to maternal stress during infancy and the preschool period, and early manifestation of behavioral inhibition. In severe cases, clinical treatment, such as therapy, may be necessary to help with social inhibition or the manifesting social disorder. Over the lifespan Social inhibition can develop over a lifespan. Children can be withdrawn, adolescents can have anxiety to social situations, and adults may have a hard time adjusting to social situations which they have to initiate on their own. To be inhibited can change and be different for many. In many cases, inhibition can lead to other social disorders and phobias. =Infants and children= In infants and children, social inhibition is characterized by a temperament style that will have children responding negatively and withdrawing from unfamiliar people, situations and objects. In addition to cessation of play, inhibited children may display long latencies to approaching an unfamiliar person, signs of fear and negative affect, and security seeking. Avoiding behavior can be seen at a very young age. In one study, Fox and colleagues found that even at four months of age some infants had negative responses to unfamiliar visual and audio stimuli. The study was longitudinal; therefore, follow ups revealed that half the infants who had high negative responses continued to show behavioral inhibition through the age of two. Fox's longitudinal study reported that the expression of behavioral inhibition showed a small degree of continuity. Over time, the toddlers who were quiet and restrained continued the trend into childhood by being cautious, quiet, and socially withdrawn. The uninhibited control group of the same ages continued to interact easily with unfamiliar people and situations. There has also been a link between inhibition at childhood age with social disorders in adolescents and adulthood. Schwartz and Kagan found that in a longitudinal study from ages two to thirteen, sixty- one percent of teens who had inhibitor traits as toddlers reported social anxiety symptoms as adolescents, compared to twenty-seven percent of adolescents who were uninhibited in earlier life. However, not every child that has some withdrawn or inhibited behavior will be inhibited as an adolescent or manifest a social disorder. The caregiver alone is not solely responsible for inhibition in children; however, in some cases it can be a factor. Caregivers can affect the inhibition levels of their child by exposing the child to maternal stress during infancy and the preschool period. In addition, in some situations the child may simply have early manifestation of behavioral inhibition. There seems to be no parenting style that researchers agree on to be the best to combat social inhibition. Park and Crinic say that a sensitive, accepting, overprotective parenting is best to reduce the negative behaviors because it will allow the child to be themselves without judgment.Park S, Belsky J, Putnam S, Crnic K. 1997. Infant emotionality, parenting, and 3-year inhibition: exploring stability and lawful discontinuity in a male sample. Dev.Psychol. 33:218–27 However, Kagan hypothesized that firm parenting styles are better suited for socially inhibited children.Kagan J. 1994. Galen's Prophecy. New York: Basic Books Researchers supporting sensitive parenting believe that too firm of a parenting style will send a message to children that says they need to change. =Adolescence= Social inhibition has been widely studied in children; however, research on how it develops through adolescence and adulthood is not as prevalent,Gladstone, G. (2004). Behavioral inhibition: Measurement and assessment of aetiology and outcome in adults Dissertation Abstracts International 65, although anxiety-related social problems are most commonly seen in adolescents. Many of the behavioral traits are the same in adolescence as they are in childhood: withdrawing from unfamiliar people, situations and objects. However, it has been tested that adolescents are more aware of their social situations and are more likely to be inhibited in public settings. Researchers found younger individuals to be more likely to differentiate between public and private settings when inquiring about potentially embarrassing issues. It is also thought that inhibition is in many ways addressed in childhood and adolescence simply because schools facilitate interactions with others. As an adult, the same facilitating circumstance may not occur unless the individual prompts them on their own. Gest states that adults do not have as may casual peer interactions and friendship opportunities that guide and support relationships unless they facilitate them on their own. Adolescent research has also shown that social inhibition is associated with a more negative emotional state in young men than women. This is in contrast to a study that measured inhibition levels through self reports from the adolescent and their parents. West and Newman found that young American Indian women and their parents reported higher levels of inhibition than young American Indian men; in addition, the parental reports also predicted social anxiety in young American Indian women over young American Indian men. In this same study, relationship development with peers was investigated over time. West and Newman stated that low levels of behavioral inhibition had an association with early social and school situations and that were related to greater levels of socially mediated anxiety, especially negative evaluation of fear by peers. This study then speculates about the possibility that adolescents and children who have a generally positive social experience will be more aware of the status of these positive relationships, therefore more anxious about failure in their social domain. Other studies also discussed how in many cases, early behavioral inhibition is a risk factor for the development of chronic high school-age inhibition and possible social anxiety disorder. Although social inhibition can be a predictor of other social disorders there is not an extremely large portion of adolescents who have developed an anxiety disorder and also had a history of inhibition in childhood. Besic and Kerr believes that appearance can be a factor for social inhibition. In their study they hypothesized that a way to handle difficult situations with behavioral inhibition was to present an off-putting appearance. They examined \\"radical\\" crowds, such as those labeled as goths and punks and if their appearances fulfilled a functions for their inhibition. They state that a radical style could be used to draw away the social boundaries and relieve them of pressures or expectations to interact in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar peers. Another possibility is that an individual may be self-handicapping to ensure that they will not have to interact with unfamiliar peers. The results revealed that radicals were significantly more inhibited than other groups. However, there are other inhibited individuals in other social classifications. The highest inhibited radical was no more inhibited than the highest inhibited individual in other groups. =Adulthood= Adult cases of social inhibition are hard to come by simply because many see it as something that happens through development. Although research is lacking, developmental considerations suggest there may be a stronger association between behavioral inhibition and peer relations in adulthood. One researcher says this lack of information may be because adults are not put in as many socially interactive situations that would guide them through the situation. It would seem that adults have an increased responsibility to initiate or structure their own social peer relationships; this is where social inhibition could have a more problematic role in adulthood than in childhood. One study that did contribute to adult research used questionnaires to study both clinical and nonclinical adults. Like in adolescence, behavioral inhibition was also found to be associated with anxiety disorders in adulthood. In addition the study found that childhood inhibition was specifically a factor in a lifetime diagnosis of social phobia. Gest also measured adult peer relations, and to what degree they had a positive and active social life. For example, researchers wanted to know if they participated in any recreational activities with others, how often they met with others, and if they had any close confiding relationships. The participants were rated on a 5-point scale on each peer relationship they disclosed. The results revealed that social inhibition had nothing to do with popularity, however it was correlated with peer relations in both genders and emotional stress in only men. A similar study found that some shy men had a low occupational status at age forty because they entered their career later in life. However, another researcher has commented on this giving this example, perhaps remaining at home longer allows young adults to accumulate educational and financial resources, before moving out and becoming more independent. Additionally it was found that young adults who were inhibited as children were less likely to move away from their families. There is also some discussion of the inhibition through generations and children mirroring their parents. Results indicated that children whose birth mothers met criteria for the diagnosis of social phobia showed elevated levels of observed behavioral inhibition. Social inhibition can decrease with age due to cognitive deficits that can occur in old age. Age-related deficits have an effect on older adults' ability to differentiate between public and private settings when discussing potentially embarrassing issues, leading them to discuss personal issues in inappropriately public situations. This suggests that deficits in inhibitory ability that lead to inappropriateness are out of the individual's control. In different contexts =In schools= Schools can be a place for children to facilitate different social interactions; however, it can also uncover social and school adjustment problems. Coplan claims that Western children with inhibition problems may be at a higher risk of developmental problems in school. Although social inhibition may be a predictor of social and school adjustment problems in children, Chen argues that the effect of social inhibition on school adjustment differs between Western cultures and Chinese culture. Chen found that in Chinese children, behavioral inhibition was associated with greater peer liking, social interaction, positive school attitudes, and school competence and fewer later learning problems, which is also different from western cultures. In other studies, researchers such as Oysterman found there to be difficulties in adjustment in children that were experiencing inhibition. In Western cultures, these difficulties are seen more because of the emphasis on social assertiveness and self-expression as traits that are valued in development. In other cultures children are sometimes expected to be inhibited. This does not contrast with other cultures in which children are socialized and assert themselves.Maccoby, E. E., & Martin, C. N. (1983). Socialization in the context of the family: Parent–child interaction. In E. M. Hetherington (Ed.), Handbook of child psychology: Vol. 4. Socialization, personality and social development (pp. 1–102). New York: Wiley. Despite these differences there are also similarities between gender. Boys were more antagonistic in peer interaction and seemed to have more learning problems in school. Girls were more cooperative in peer interaction and had a more positive outlook on school. They formed more affiliations with peers, and performed more completely in school.Eisenberg, N., Fabes, R. A., & Spinrad, T. L. (2006). Prosocial development. In N. Eisenberg (Ed.), Handbook of child psychology: Vol. 3. Social, emotional, and personality development (pp. 646–718). New York: Wiley. Other researchers like Geng have looked to understand social inhibition, effortful control, and attention in school. In Geng's study, gender came in to play with high socially inhibited girls being extremely aware of their surroundings, possibly paying too much attention to potentially anxious situations. It is well known in a large number of research studies social inhibition had been linked to other anxiety disorders. However Degnan and colleagues believe that being able to regulate your effortful control may serve to reduce the anxiety the comes from inhibition. Nesdale and Dalton investigated inhibition of social group norms in school children between the ages of seven and nine. In schools there becomes an increase in social in-groups and out-groups as children increase in age. This study created different in-groups or exclusive groups and out-groups or inclusive groups. The results showed that students in the inclusive group liked all students more, while students in the exclusive group like their group over other groups. This study could help in the future to facilitate school peer groups more efficiently. =In the workplace= Social inhibition can manifest in all social situations and relationships. One place that we can see the effects of social inhibition is in the workplace. Research has shown that social inhibition can actually affect the way that one completes a given amount of work In one experiment, participants completed a task in a laboratory setting, varying whether or not another individual was present in the room with the participants while they attempted to complete the task. The results showed that when another individual was present in the room the person focused on completing the experimental task decreased their body movements, hand movements, and vocalization, even though the other person did not speak to or even look at the participant. This suggests that just the mere presence of another person in a social situation can inhibit an individual. However, although the individual in charge of completing the experimental task was socially inhibited by the presence of another person in the laboratory, there were no significant links between their social inhibition when completing the task and improved performance on said task. These findings suggest that an individual may socially inhibit themselves in the work place if another person is also in the room, however, such inhibition does not suggest that the inhibited individual is actually performing the duties assigned to them with more accuracy or focus. In psychological disorders =Depression= Links between social inhibition and depression can be found in individuals who experienced social inhibited behaviors during childhood. Researchers from the United Kingdom conducted a study in an attempt to explain possible links between social inhibition in infancy and later signs of depression. The researchers based their study on previous information from literature acknowledging that there are social and non-social forms of inhibition, and that social inhibition is significantly related to early social fears. The researchers hypothesized that social inhibition in childhood would be linked to higher levels of depression in later years. Participants completed a number of questionnaires about their experiences of social inhibition in childhood and their current levels of depression. Results showed a significant relationship between depression and recalled social fears, or, social inhibitions during childhood. Furthermore, the researchers related their findings to another study conducted by Muris et al., in 2001 which found that there is an association between social inhibition and depression in adolescents. The study compared adolescents who were not inhibited to those who are, and found that \\"adolescents experiencing high levels of behavioral inhibition were more depressed than their counterparts who experienced intermediate or low levels of behavioral inhibition\\". Another study set out to examine the link between social inhibition and depression, with the basis for their study being that social inhibition (which they explain as a part of type D personality, or distressed personality) is related to emotional distress The researchers explain that a major factor related to social inhibition is the inhibited individual not expressing their emotions and feelings, a factor that the researchers cite in relation to the link between social inhibition and depression. Overall, the results of the study show that social inhibition (as a factor of type D personality) predicts depression, regardless of the baseline depression level of the individual. Significantly, this study was conducted with young, healthy adults, as opposed to working with those in self-help groups or with individuals who have a preexisting medical or psychological condition. =Fear= Social inhibition can be affected by fear responses that one has in the early \\"toddler years\\" of their life. In 2011, researchers Elizabeth J. Kiel and Kristin A. Buss examined \\"how attention toward an angry-looking gorilla mask in a room with alternative opportunities for play in 24-month-old toddlers predicted social inhibition when children entered kindergarten\\". In the study, the researchers specifically looked at the toddlers' attention to threat and their fear of novelty in other situations. The researchers paid special attention to these two factors due to previous research suggesting that \\"sustained attention to putatively threatening novelty relates to anxious behavior in the first 2 years of life\\". Also, it has been found in earlier research conducted by Buss and colleagues that no matter the differences, individual responses to novelty during early childhood can be related to later social inhibition. These results already link fear responses, particularly in children, to social inhibition, mainly such inhibition that manifests later on in the individual's life. Overall, the researchers based their experiment on the notion that the more time a toddler spends being attentive towards a novel potential threat the greater the chance that they will experience issues with the regulation of distress, which can predict anxious behavior such as social inhibition. Through a study intended to further connect and understand links between fear and late social inhibitions, the researchers conducted a study where they worked with 24-month-old toddlers. They placed the toddlers in a room called the \\"risk room\\" which is set up with a number of play areas for the toddlers to interact with, with one of those areas being a potentially threatening stimulus, in this case, an angry looking gorilla mask. The children are left alone, with only their primary caregiver sitting in the corner of the room, to explore the play areas for three minutes, and then the experimenter returns and instructs the toddler to interact with each of the play areas. The purpose of this was to allow for other experimenters to code the reactions of the toddler to the stimuli around him or her, paying special attention to their attention to threat, their proximity to the threat, and their fear of novelty. The results of this study indicate that attention to threat (attention given, by the toddler to the feared stimuli) predicts social inhibition in kindergarten. Further, if the child approaches the feared stimuli, the relation to later social inhibition is not significant. When a child's behavior is to keep more than two feet away from the threatening stimulus, their behavior can be seen as linked to later social inhibition. Another important factor that the researchers found when looking at the prediction of social inhibition is the child paying a significant amount of attention to a feared or threatening stimuli in the presence of other, enjoyable activities. Mainly, if the child's duration of attention to the threatening stimuli is significant even when there are other enjoyable activities available for them to interact with, the link to later social inhibition is stronger due to the fact that \\"toddler-aged children have increased motoric skill and independence in exploring their environments; so they are capable of using more sophisticated distraction techniques, such as involvement with other activities\\" (Kopp, 1982 PG 199). In another study looking at social inhibition and fear, the researchers made the distinction between different forms of inhibition. Mainly looking at behavioral inhibition the researchers separated the category into two subcategories, social behavioral inhibition and non-social behavioral inhibition. The researchers cite an experiment conducted by Majdandzic and Van den Boom where they used a laboratory setting to attempt to elicit fear in the children. They did this by using both social and non-social stimuli. What Majdandizic and Van der Boom found was a variability in the way that fear was elicited in the children when using either the social or non-social stimuli. Essentially, this study realized that there is a correlation between social stimuli producing fear expressions in children, whereas non-social stimuli is not correlated to fear. This can be evidence of social inhibition due to the social stimuli that result in fear expressions in children. The researchers of the current study took the results from the Majdandizic and Van der Boom study and expanded on their work by looking at variability in fear expressions in both socially inhibited children and non-socially inhibited children. What they found was that mainly socially inhibited children have effects such as shyness and inhibition with peers, adults, and in performance situations, as well as social phobia and separation anxiety. The stronger link with fear reactions comes mainly from those children who were non-socially behaviorally inhibited. While these results go against previous findings, what the researchers were eager to stipulate was that \\"the normative development of fear in children have indicated that many specific fears (e.g., fear of animals) decline with age, whereas social fears increase as children get older\\". =Social phobia= Social inhibition is linked to social phobia, in so much as social inhibition during childhood can be seen as a contributing factor to developing social phobia later on in life. While social inhibition is also linked to social anxiety, it is important to point out the difference between social anxiety and social phobia. Social anxiety is marked by a tendency to have high anxiety before a social interaction, but not experience the avoidance of the social activity that is associated with social phobia. Social phobia and social inhibition are linked in a few different ways, one being physiologically. When one is experiencing extreme levels of inhibition they can suffer from symptoms such as accelerated heart rate, increased morning salivary cortisol levels, and muscle tension in their vocal cords. These symptoms are also reported by those with social phobia, which indicates that both social inhibition and social phobia interact with the sympathetic nervous system when the individual encounters a stressful situation. Further, it is suggested throughout literature that social inhibition during childhood is linked to later social phobia. Beyond that research has indicated that continuity in inhibition plays an important role in the later development of social phobia. Continuity of social inhibition means someone experiencing social inhibition for a number of year continuously. The research explains work done with young teenagers, which found that the teenagers who had been classified as inhibited 12 years earlier were significantly more likely to develop social phobia than young teenagers who were not classified as inhibited. This research pertains to the link between social inhibition and generalized social phobia, rather than specific phobias. When looking at continuity in social inhibition some research offers reasoning as to why the social inhibition may continue long enough to be a predictor of social phobia. Researchers have suggested that if the early childhood relationships are not satisfactory they can influence the child to respond to situations in certain inhibitory ways. When this happens it is often then associated with poor self- evaluation for the child, which can lead to increased social inhibition and social phobia. Also, if a child is neglected or rejected by their peers, rather than by their caregiver, they often develop a sense of social failure, which often extends into social inhibition, and later social phobia. The link between social inhibition and social phobia is somewhat exclusive, when testing for a possible link between non-social inhibition and social phobia no predictive elements were found. It is particularly social inhibition that is linked to social phobia. The research also suggests that social inhibitions can be divided between different kinds of social fears, or different patterns of inhibition can be seen in individuals. The researchers suggest that certain patterns, or certain social fears, can be better predictors of social phobia than others. Mainly, the researchers suggest that there can be different patterns of social inhibition in relation to an unfamiliar object or encounter. These specific patterns should be looked at in conjunction with motivation and the psychophysiological reaction to the object or encounter to determine the specific patterns that are the better predictors of social phobia. Another study aimed to examine the link between social inhibition and social phobia also found that social phobia is linked to the social phobic being able to recall their own encounters with social inhibition during childhood. The social phobic participants were able to recall social and school fears from their childhood, but they also were able to recall sensory- processing sensitivity which indicates that the social phobic participants in the study were able to recall having increased sensitivity to the situations and behaviors around them. Another study explains that social phobia itself has a few different ways it can manifest. The study aims at understanding the link between social inhibition and social phobia, as well as depression in social phobia. What the study found was an important link connecting the severity of social inhibition during childhood to the severity of social phobia and factors of social phobia in later years. Severe social inhibition during childhood can be related to lifetime social phobia. Further, the researchers point out that inhibition during childhood is significantly linked to avoidant personality disorder in social phobia as well as childhood inhibition linked with major depressive disorder in social phobia that spans across the individual's lifetime. A major suggestion related to the results of the study suggested that while inhibition can be a general predictor of risk factors related to social phobia, it may not be a specific predictor of social phobia alone. =Social anxiety disorder= Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a fear of scrutiny or disapproval from others. Individuals believe this negative reaction will bring about rejections. Individuals with social anxiety disorder have stronger anxious feeling over a long period of time and are more anxious more often. In many cases, researchers have found that social inhibition can be a factor in developing other disorders such as social anxiety disorder. Being inhibited does not mean that an individual will develop another disorder; however, Clauss and colleagues conducted a study to measure the association between behavioral inhibition and social anxiety disorder. The results of the study discovered that 15% of all children have behavioral inhibition and about half of those children will eventually develop social anxiety disorder. This is why behavioral inhibition is seen as a larger risk factor. That being said, Lim and colleagues researched the differences between early and late onset of social anxiety disorder and its relation to social inhibition. Through the duration of their study, they found those diagnosed as early onset had complaints other than ones about social anxiety symptoms. Early onset individuals would frequently have more severe symptoms and higher levels of behavioral inhibition. Additional behavioral inhibition was more severe especially in social and school situations with only the early onset cases. Lorian and Grisham researched the relationship between behavioral inhibition, risk-avoidance, and social anxiety symptoms. They found that all three factors correlated with each other and risk avoidance is potentially a mechanism linked to an anxiety pathology. Reduction =Alcohol consumption= Social inhibition can be lowered by a few different factors, one of them being alcohol. Alcohol consumption can be seen to lower inhibitions in both men and women. Social inhibitions generally act to control or affect the way that one conducts themselves in a social setting. By lowering inhibitions alcohol can work to increase social behaviors either negatively or positively. Importantly, one must remember that the higher the dosage of alcohol, the greater the damage it will cause to inhibitory control. By lowering inhibitions, alcohol can cause social behaviors such as aggression, self disclosure, and violent acts. Researchers have suggested that situational cues used to inhibit social behaviors are not perceived the same way after someone consumes enough alcohol to qualify them as drunk: \\"interacting parties who are impaired by alcohol are less likely to see justifications for the other's behavior, are thus more likely to interpret the behavior as arbitrary and provocative, and then, having less access to inhibiting cues and behavioral standards, are more likely to react extremely.\\" This idea of increased extreme social behaviors is believed to come as a result of lowered inhibitions after consuming alcohol. Alcohol can lower inhibitions for a number of reasons, it can reduce one's self-awareness, impair perceptual and cognitive functioning, allows for instigator pressures to have more influence over an individual, and can reduce one's ability to read inhibitory social cues and standards of conduct. When attempting to examine the effects that alcohol consumption has on social inhibition researchers found that after being provoked sober individuals used inhibiting cues, such as the innocence of the instigator and the severity of the retaliation to control their response to the aggressive provocation. However, the researchers found that an intoxicated individual did not have these same inhibitions and, as a result, exhibited more extreme behaviors of retaliated aggression to the provocation without processing information they would normally consider about the situation. On average, drunken individuals exhibited more aggression, self-disclosure, risk taking behaviors, and laughter than sober individuals. Extreme behaviors are not as common in sober individuals because they are able to read inhibitory cues and social conduct norms that drunken individuals are not as inclined to consider. These negative social behaviors, then, are a result of lowered social inhibitions. Alcohol consumption also has the ability to lower inhibitions in a positive way. Research has been conducted looking at the way an intoxicated person is more inclined to be helpful. Researchers were of the same opinion that alcohol lowers inhibitions and allows for more extreme behaviors, however, they tested to see if this would be true for more socially acceptable situations, such as helping another person. The researchers acknowledged that, generally, an impulse to help another is initiated but then inhibitions will cause the potential helper to consider all factors going into their decision to help or not to help such as, lost time, boredom, fatigue, monetary costs, and possibility of personal harm. The researchers suggest that while one may be inhibited and therefore less likely to offer help when completely sober, after consuming alcohol enough damage will be done to their inhibitory functioning to actually increase helping. While this suggestion differs from socially negative behaviors that are seen after social inhibitions have been lowered, it is consistent with the idea that alcohol consumption can lower inhibitions and, as a result, produce more socially extreme behaviors when compared to a sober counterpart. Alcohol consumption can lower social inhibitions in both men and women, producing social behaviors not typical in the individuals' day- to-day sober lives. For example, in social settings women will tend to be uncomfortable with sexual acts and provocations as well as feeling uncomfortable in social settings that are generally male dominated such as strip clubs or bars. However, consumption of alcohol has been seen to lower these inhibitions, making women feel freer and more ready to participate socially in events and behaviors that they would normally feel inhibited from participating in if they were sober. As an example, women participating in bachelorette parties generally consume copious amounts of alcohol for the event. As a result, the females feel less inhibited and are more likely to then engage in behavior that they would normally view as deviant or inappropriate. In an examination of bachelorette parties it was found that when those attending the party consumed only a couple of drinks behavior minimally reflected any alcohol consumption, assuming that the party guests were still socially inhibited and less inclined to perform deviant behaviors. Similarly, \\"levels of intoxication were correlated with the atmosphere of the party, such that parties with little or no alcohol were perceived as less 'wild' than parties a lot of alcohol consumption.\\" Conceivably, the bachelorette parties show tendencies of \\"wild\\" behavior after excessive alcohol consumption, which consequently lowers the inhibitions of the consumers. When surveyed a number of women who had attended a bachelorette party, or had one in their honor, in the past year reported that their behavior when under the influence of alcohol was different from their behavior when sober. One party guest reported: \\"People drink … to lose inhibitions and stuff that is done… I would never do sober. It lowers inhibitions - that is the main point of it.\\" These reports suggest that \\"alcohol was used to lower inhibitions about being too sexual, about the risk of being perceived as promiscuous, or about being sexual in public. Women commented that they felt freer to talk about sex while under the influence of alcohol, to flirt with male strangers, or to dance with a male stripper.\\" The research collected surrounding women and their alcohol consumption in these settings provide examples of the reduction of social inhibitions in relation to excess alcohol consumption =Power= Social inhibitions can also be reduced by means unrelated to an actual substance. Another way that social inhibition can be decreased is by the attainment of power. Research has examined the way that having either elevated or reduced power effects social interactions and well- being in social situations. Such research has shown a relationship between elevated power and decreased social inhibitions. This relationship of those with elevated power and those with reduced power can be seen in all forms of social interactions, and is marked by elevated power individuals often having access to resources that the reduced power individuals do not have. Decreased social inhibition is seen in those with elevated power for two main reasons, one being that they have more access to resources, providing them with comforts and stability. The second reason is that their status as a high power individual often provides the powerful individual a sense of being above social consequences, allowing them to act in ways that a reduced power individual may not. The elevated power individuals will experience reduced social inhibition in various ways, one being that they are more likely to approach, rather than avoid, another person. Also, with the reduced inhibition associated with high power individuals, they are more likely to initiate physical contact with another person, enter into their personal space, and they are more likely to indicate interest in intimacy. High power people tend to be socially disinhibited when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual concepts. Consistent with this expectation, a study working with male and female participants found that when the male and female felt equally powerful they tended to interact socially with one another in a disinhibited manner. Further, the research suggests that as a result of their reduced social inhibition, powerful individuals will be guided to behave in a way that fits with their personality traits in a social situation in which they feel powerful. Similarly, in a laboratory study it was found that when one person in a group feels powerful their reduced social inhibition can result in decreased manners. The study found that, when offered food, the powerful individual is more likely to take more than the other individuals in the room. This can be seen as the powerful individual exhibiting reduced social inhibitions, as they reduce their attention to common social niceties such as manners and sharing. Increase =Power= Certain factors can increase social inhibition in individuals. Increased inhibitions can occur in different situations and for different reasons. One major factor that contributes to the increase of social inhibition is power. Reduced power is linked to an array of negative affect, one of which being increased social inhibitions. Power, in this instance, can be defined as a fundamental factor in social relationships that is central to interactions,Russell, B. (1938). Power: A new social analysis. London: Allen and Unwin influencing behavior and emotional display.Clark, C. (1990). Emotions and micropolitics in everyday life: Some patterns and paradoxes of \\"place.\\" In: T. D. Kemper (Ed.), Research agendas in the sociology of emotions (pp. 305-333). Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. Further, power is such an essential factor in social relationships because power determines who is the giver and who is the receiver in the exchange of rewards and resources. Power is present in all social relationships, not just typical hierarchical establishments such as in employment or school settings. Power, then, is related to increased social inhibitions when an individual feels that they are in a powerless or diminished power position. Those who are deemed to be high in power are generally richer in resources and freedom, as well as decreased levels of social inhibition, whereas those who are deemed to be low in power are generally low in resources, constrained, and prone to experiencing increased social inhibition. Research shows that individuals who are considered to be low in power experience more social threats and punishments, and generally have less access to social resources. As a result of this these individuals are prone to developing more sensitivity to criticism from others, and are more susceptible to accepting when someone constrains them. These factors contribute to increasing social inhibition in those individuals. Similarly, studies have shown that the absence of power can heighten the processes associated with social inhibition. Experiments on the interaction between power and inhibition have shown that when participants are in a situation where they perceive more punishments and threats their cognition and behavior will show more signs of social inhibition related affect. Environments which distinguish the differences between the powerful and the powerless can lead to the social inhibition of the power reduced individuals as a response to their social interactions with the heightened power individuals. Some of the social inhibited behaviors that a low-power individual will experience in these social situations will be embarrassment and fear and they may even go on to feel guilt, sadness, and shame (C. Anderson, Langner, & Keltner). Further, low power individuals can be seen socially inhibiting themselves in ways that can, in the end, favor the high-power individuals. These can include inhibiting themselves from providing input on ideas, hesitating in normal speech, and even increasing their facial muscle actions in order to keep themselves from displaying emotions. When the low-power individuals are in a social situation with a high-power individual they will also commonly exhibit social inhibition by inhibiting their postural constriction and reducing their gestures (Ellyson & Dovidio). Researchers have generalized these suggestions of interaction between a high-power individual and low-power individuals to say that these expressions of social inhibition are expected to carry over into all areas of social interaction for the low-power individual. That is to say that low-power individuals will not only exhibit social inhibition when in the presence of a high-power individual. They will continue to be socially inhibited in all social aspects of their lives as a result of their low-power status. Further, low-power individuals tend to devote increased attention to the actions and behaviors of others. =Biological factors= Another possible explanation for increased social inhibition has to do with biological factors. A study of brain activity in those who rate high on the scale for social inhibition showed a number of brain areas that are related to the heightened inhibitions. In their study the researchers aimed to find the link between socially inhibited individuals and an over activation of the cortical social brain network. The researchers did this by examining the brain activity of individuals who rate high in social inhibition as they respond to video clips of facial and bodily expressions that were potentially threatening. What the researchers found was that those who rate high in social inhibition show an overactive orbitofrontal cortex, left temporo-parietal junction, and right extrastriate body area. When the threat -related activity was being presented to the participants, these areas of the brain showed increased activity in comparison to those who do not rate high for social inhibition. What the researchers speculate is that, in this instance, hyperactivity in these brain structures does not mean better functioning. Further, \\"the orbitofrontal cortex is connected with areas that underlie emotional function and empathy\\". This relates to one's ability to stimulate how another person feels in their own facial displays. The over activity and decreased function of these brain structures can affect individuals by increasing social inhibition and behaviors related to social inhibition. =Personality traits= Further, there is speculation that social inhibition can also be increased by the type of personality an individual has and behaviors that those individuals inherently display. Namely, those who are dependent and reassurance seeking are more commonly likely to display increased social inhibition.The Effect of Behavioral Inhibition and Approach on Normal Social Functioning. (2010). Individual Differences Research, 8(4), 246-256. Clinical levels Although social inhibition can occur as part of ordinary social situations, a chronically high level of social inhibition may lead some individuals to develop other social or anxiety disorders that would also need to be handled clinically. Through childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, clinical levels of social inhibition can be measured. Social inhibition can be a precursors for other social disorders that can develop in adolescence or adulthood. =Measures= There are many implications for the diagnoses of social inhibition, however there are many cost-efficient ways to measure and treat this social disorder. One measure that has reliably assess the traits of social inhibition is the seven-item inhibition scale of the Type D Scale–14. Another measure is the Behavioral Inhibition Observation System (BIOS). In clinical trials this measure is to be used for children completed by parents, teachers, and clinicians. Other scales are the Behavioral Inhibition Questionnaire (BIQ), Behavioral Inhibition Instrument (BII), the Behavioral Inhibition Scale (BIS), The Preschool Behavioral Inhibition Scale (P-BIS), and the Behavioral Inhibition Scale for children ages 3–6. There are also many versions of these scales that are specifically for parents, teachers, or even the child or possibly an inhibited individual to take. There are also times when these measures are grouped together; in many cases the Behavioral Inhibition System scale and Behavioral Activation System scale are used together. These two measure are the most widely used and together they consist of behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation scales that deal with reward response and fun seeking. The Behavioral Paradigm System is an observation system that allows measurements of behavioral inhibition in systematic natural environments. With this system researchers will observe cessation of play and vocalization, long latencies to approaching the unfamiliar person, signs of fear and negative affect, and security seeking in environments such as classrooms, playgrounds, and in home settings. This paradigm was followed by many adaptations, one specifically was the adaptation of the Observational Paradigm. In an additional study by Ballespi and colleagues the paradigm was changed to be more suitable for a school environment. The adapted paradigm met three important criteria, the tests were suitable for a school environment, there had to be materials for the test that could be transported easily, and the observation of behavioral inhibition signs had to have the potential to be seen in a short period of time. Ballespi and colleagues discussed one of the most recent measurement systems in the Behavioral Inhibition Observation System. This new system will allow clinicians to provide a quick measure for behavioral inhibition. This system is used during the first meeting with the child. In this first meeting, the child will be exposed to a strange, unfamiliar situation. The scale will then be completed after the therapist has time to observe the child in an interview setting. Researchers want to find a way to have an actual measure for inhibition, however this is difficult. There is a difference in observations, a parent or teachers is going to observe the child over long periods of time in several natural situations. The parents do not actually observe the child but instead rate the behavior inhibition on the ideas they have formed about the child. The clinician will not have all this information and will base his or her first measure on observation alone; they measure state while parents and teachers measure traits. This is where the differences come up in measure however after several visits the measures of the clinicians, teachers, and parents become more similar. =Treatments= Treatments used for social inhibition are primarily assertive trainings introduced by therapies. These treatments are about teaching the inhibited individual to express and assert their feeling instead of inhibiting them. Assertiveness training is an important operation for behavioral therapist because it can help with behavioral issues, as well as interpersonal inadequacies, and anxiety in adults. In some cases this training can go by a different name because assertiveness is sometimes categorized by aggression therefore it can also be called appropriate expression training. In one study discussing assertive training Ludwig and Lazarus found irrational cognitive patterns that inhibited individuals have to deal with and how to overcome them. The four patterns are self-criticism/Perfectionism, unrealistic approval needs, unrealistic labeling of aggression/assertive behavior, and criticism of others. There are three different phases that work to combat the irrational cognitive patterns and inhibitory actions during social situations. These phases are meant to be actively practiced. The individual will receive homework assignments, and have to do role-playing exercises to overcome their inhibitions. The first phase discussed was about talking more. Ludwig states that there cannot just be an increase in talking but also an increase in expressing and talking about how one feels. The point of this phase is to get an individual talking no matter how ridiculous or trivial it may seem. Phase two is about dealing with the responses that come from talking more. When an inhibited individual starts talking more they may become embarrassed. However, with positive reactions from others they will learn that being embarrassed about some of the comments made is not devastating, and in turn the individual may talk and act more freely. In addition to the positive feedback the individual will review particularly embarrassing moment to assess why they were embarrassed to help combat those thoughts. If the inhibited person can understand the irrational thoughts they will eventually feel less embarrassed and act more freely. Role playing is also a way to help the individual understand different social behaviors. Mirroring is a way some therapist will show the client their own behavior. The last phase deals with additional strategies that can help through social situation such as expressing disagreement, dealing with interruptions, initiating more conversations topics, and more self-disclosure. Ludwig and colleagues also make sure to explain that no one should compulsively apply these behavioral techniques in all situations. An individual should not go over board using them; additionally there are times when initiating some conversation topics and talking more are inappropriate. Group therapies are also used in the treatment using assertiveness. Hedquist and Weinhold investigated two group counseling strategies with socially anxious and unassertive college students. The first strategy is a behavioral rehearsal group, which aims to assist members to learn more efficient responses in social situations. This was to be accomplished by rehearsing several difficult social situations. The second strategy was a social learning group that was about honesty about everything; any withholding behaviors were seen as being dishonest. Another rule was every individual had to take responsibility for everything that said. The results of this study showed that both strategies helped significantly in treating the anxiety and unassertiveness.

The village is often just called Fingal. The headland and the small off-shore Island (Cook Island) were first sighted by James Cook about 17:00 on 16 May 1770 (log date and time). At the time of the 2016 census, Fingal Head had a population of 592 people. Geography Tweed River viewed from Fingal, New South Wales, 2009 The Tweed River, (named by John Oxley in October 1823) on the north coast of New South Wales runs northwards close to the coast for about 6 km before reaching its mouth just south of present-day Point Danger. A spit about 500–800 metres wide called \\"Letitia Spit\\" (named after the first ship to enter the river in July 1840) runs south for 2 km to Fingal Head. The headland itself was made from a lava flow from the now extinct Tweed Volcano. The rock composition in the area is mainly basalt or andesite. There are walking tracks all over this area. About 500 metres offshore from the headland is Cook Island, a rocky uninhabited island first charted by James Cook in 1770. The stretch of water to the island is called the \\"Giants Causeway\\", named after the famous Giants Causeway between Northern Ireland and Western Scotland. Cook Island was made a marine reserve in 1998 and as such fishing is prohibited in the waters nearby. History View from Fingal Head, circa 1934 There has been controversy over the naming of Fingal Head by James Cook in May 1770 for many years. Strong evidence suggests that Fingal Head was, in fact, the point James Cook named Point Danger. In 1823, John Oxley took shelter from Southerly winds, while sailing North from Port Macquarie. John Uniack and later Oxley went onto the island, where they found some sea turtles and called the island \\"Turtle Island\\". In 1828 Henry John Rous (Captain of HMS Rainbow) surveyed Oxley's Tweed River, the name used today. A chart published in 1831 by the Master of the \\"Rainbow\\" showing the island as \\"Cook's Isle\\" and the river named the \\"Clarance River\\" - the unnamed headland, North of the river was also named Point Danger. However the off-shore reefs East of the Island were not marked. Fingal Head would be named as such by Surveyor Robert Dixon who mapped the coastal districts between Brisbane Town and the Brunswick River in the winter months of 1840. It first appears on a map published By Dixon in Sydney in 1842. Dixon's party was also assisted at that time by the master and crew of the schooner Letitia, which they found had entered the Tweed. Hence the naming of Letitia Point. There is also every suggestion that Dixon made reference to the Giant's Causeway. It is highly probable that \\"Fingal Head\\" was named after Fingal's Cave on the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland because of the similarity in appearance due to naturally formed Columnar Basalt outcrops which extend above the ocean surface. The local aboriginal people were the Minjungbal, but white settlement significantly impacted the population in the late 19th to early 20th century.James Cook's hand-written manuscript dated 16 may 1770 held at the National LibraryJohn Oxley's hand-written note book, dated Fri.31 Oct [1823] (Archives Office of NSW location 2/8093) In 1933, the last female full-blood Aborigine on the Tweed was laid to rest in Fingal's Aboriginal cemetery following a service conducted at the mission church. Fingal Head Post Office opened on 15 March 1912, uprated from a telegraph office opened in October 1911. Demographics In the , Fingal Head recorded a population of 544 people, 48% female and 52% male. The median age of the Fingal Head population was 42 years, 5 years above the national median of 37. 77% of people living in Fingal Head were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 3.1%, New Zealand 2.8%, Hong Kong 0.6%, Germany 0.6%, Czech Republic 0.6%. 88.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.6% Bandjalang, 0.6% Italian, 0.6% Gumbaynggir, 0.6% Czech. Lighthouse Fingal Head Light with keeper, circa 1906 A provisional light station was established on the head in 1872 and in 1878 a proper lighthouse, built as a sandstone construction in a round design, was inaugurated. It was part of a series of five such lighthouses established between 1878 and 1880. The tower stands only seven metres high, but that suffices since the headland itself adds additional height. Thus the focal plane of the lightsource is situated 24 m above sea level. In 1920 the lightsource was changed from kerosene to acetylene and became automated. It was electrified in 1980. The light characteristic is a single flash every five seconds. Depending on the bearing, red light is shown in the east sector while the other sectors show white. Surfing Since 1996 Fingal has hosted an annual surfing competition for indigenous surfers. The first year attracted 90 surfers from across Australia. In 1999, SBS television commissioned a documentary called Surfing the Healing Wave about that competition, as part of an Unfinished Business - Reconciling the Nation series. It won Best Australian Documentary at the 2000 Real Life on Film Festival. Fingal is not particularly noted as a surf spot as such. The headland does not form a point break on either side, so it is just beach breaks that occur there, but the southern side is one of the few places near the Gold Coast with any protection from northerly winds.Surfing the Healing Wave at the Australian Film CommissionSurfing the Healing Wave at Ronin Films  References  External links * Fingal Head page at Geoscience Australia * Fingal Head travel, in The Age newspaper 8 February 2004 * Northern Rivers Geology Blog - Fingal Head Headlands of New South Wales Suburbs of Tweed Heads, New South Wales Tweed Volcano Surfing locations in New South Wales Coastal towns in New South Wales ","title":"Fingal Head, New South Wales"},{"id":"4031847","text":"Ellen Browning Scripps (October 18, 1836 – August 3, 1932) was an American journalist and philanthropist who was the founding donor of several major institutions in Southern California. She and her half-brother E. W. Scripps created America's largest chain of newspapers, linking Midwestern industrial cities with booming towns in the West. By the 1920s, Ellen Browning Scripps was worth an estimated $30 million (or $3.5 billion in 2016 dollars), most of which she gave away. In 1924, she founded the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, CA. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine after founding Scripps College in Claremont, California. She also donated millions of dollars to organizations worldwide that promised to advance democratic principles and women's education. She never married. Family history Ellen Browning Scripps was born on October 18, 1836, on South Molton St. in St. George Parish, London. Her father, James Mogg Scripps (1803–1873), was the youngest of six children born to London publisher William Armiger Scripps (1772–1851) and Mary Dixie (1771–1838). He was apprenticed to Charles Lewis, the leading bookbinder of London where he learned the trade. James married his cousin Elizabeth Sabey in 1829 and had two children, only one of whom lived to maturity, Elizabeth Mary (1831–1914). Elizabeth Sabey Scripps died the day after the latter's birth. Two years later, James Mogg married Ellen Mary Saunders. They had six children, five of whom lived to adulthood: James E. Scripps (1835–1906), Ellen Browning (1836–1932), William Arminger (1838–1914), George Henry (1839–1900) and John Mogg (1840–1863). Ellen Mary Scripps died of breast cancer in 1841. After the failure of his bookbinding shop and the death of his second wife, James Mogg emigrated to the United States with his six children in April 1844. They headed to Rushville, Illinois, where other members of the Scripps family owned property. James Mogg married his third wife Julia Osborn in November 1844. They had five children: Julia Anne (1847–1898), Thomas Osborn (1848–53), Frederick Tudor (1850–1936), Eliza Virginia (1852–1921), and Edward Wyllis or E.W. Scripps (1854–1926), the well-known newspaper tycoon and founder of The E.W. Scripps Company. Biography =Early life= Old Main Knox CollegeBorn in London and raised on the Illinois prairie, Ellen Browning Scripps was the only one of her ten siblings to attend college. She studied science and mathematics at Knox College in Galesburg, IL, one of the few educational institutions to admit women, even if it did not yet grant college degrees. She graduated in 1859 with a certificate from the Female Collegiate Department. Afterwards, she returned to Rushville, Illinois, to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. =Newspaper journalist= After the American Civil War, Scripps gave up her job as a schoolteacher and headed to Detroit, at that time a burgeoning industrial center in the West. She joined her brother James E. Scripps in publishing The Detroit Evening News, a short, inexpensive, and politically independent newspaper pitched to the city's working class. This was to be the start of the Scripps family fortune. She wrote a daily column, nicknamed \\"Miss Ellen's Miscellany,\\" that reduced local and national news to short sound bites. According to Gerald Baldasty, \\"Her columns of \\"Miscellany\\" and other topics became the inspiration for the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a news features service that Edward Scripps established in 1902.\\" In the 1870s and 1880s, the Scripps papers expanded to include The Cleveland Press, The Cincinnati Post, and the St. Louis Chronicle. A shareholder, Ellen Scripps played an important role in Scripps councils. She gave business advice to her younger half-brother E.W. and sided with him in family financial disputes. He credited her with saving him from financial ruin in more than one instance. In the 1880s, E.W.'s attempt to seize control of the Scripps Publishing Company failed, resulting in a divisive lawsuit and a break with his half-brother James. =Travels= In 1881, Ellen and E.W. travelled to Europe so that the latter could take a break from work and recover his health. They took the railroad through France to the Mediterranean Sea, crossed by ship to Algeria, then headed north into Italy, Austria, and Germany. Ellen wrote letters back to The Detroit Evening News about their travels, describing her impressions of people and places. When Ellen returned to her job at the News, she found that she was no longer needed at the copy desk. She began a decade of travel, heading to the American South, New England, Cuba, and Mexico. In 1888–1889 she made a second trip to Europe that included a visit to L'Exposition Universelle in Paris and three months in Spain. A decade later, she toured France, Belgium, and England. =California= In 1887, Ellen's sister Julia Anne moved to Alameda, California, to seek a remedy for crippling rheumatoid arthritis. She found a home at the Remedial Institute and School of Philosophy, one of the many utopian communities founded in the late nineteenth century. Concerned about her sister's welfare, Ellen made her first trip to California in the winter of 1890. Soon afterwards, Ellen and E.W. bought land in San Diego and established Miramar Ranch with their brother Fred. Miramar Ranch encompassed what is now Scripps Ranch, a suburban community, and the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The ranch house was torn down in 1973. Ellen lived, on and off, at Miramar until 1897 when she moved into a seaside cottage that she had built in La Jolla. She named it South Molton Villa (sometimes spelled South Moulton Villa) after the street on which she had been born. Ellen gradually stepped out of her intimate family circle and began to acquire a large set of female acquaintances. La Jolla had a growing number of summer and year-round residents, many of whom were unmarried women or widows. She remarked that in the early days, \\"It was a woman's town.\\" She was a founding member of the La Jolla Woman's Club and became involved in a wide variety of progressive causes. In 1909, she and her sister Virginia helped Joseph H. Johnson, the bishop of the Los Angeles Diocese of the Episcopal Church, to establish The Bishop's School as a preparatory school for girls. Ellen Browning Scripps's house South Molton Villa II designed by architect Irving J. Gill. South Molton Villa, located on Prospect St. in La Jolla, was located next to Wisteria Cottage, a bungalow owned by Virginia Scripps. Wisteria Cottage was renovated in 1910 by architect Irving J. Gill a pioneer in the modernist movement. It now serves as the gallery and exhibition space of the La Jolla Historical Society. After South Molton Villa was destroyed by fire in 1915, Ellen Scripps commissioned Gill to build a new, fireproof concrete structure in the same modern architectural language as The Bishop's School, the La Jolla Woman's Club, and the La Jolla Recreational Center. It has been described as one of Gill's \\"masterworks.\\" In 1941, Ellen's trustees donated her house to The Art Center, later the Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla. The structure was altered beyond recognition. In 1996, a renovation by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown exposed the original facade. The Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, in La Jolla =Wealth= Ellen Browning Scripps made a fortune by investing in E.W. Scripps's growing chain of newspapers in the West. In 1894, E.W. formed a partnership with Milton A. McRae, who had risen through the ranks to become one of Scripps's top lieutenants. George H. Scripps joined the partnership in 1895. The group managed The Cincinnati Post, The Cleveland Press, The St. Louis Chronicle, The Toledo News-Bee, and the Kansas City Star. They also acquired newspapers in Memphis, Oklahoma City, Evansville, Terre Haute, Columbus, Denver, Dallas, and Houston. In the late 1890s, E.W. began to acquire papers in California, including The Los Angeles Record, The San Diego Sun, and The San Francisco News. In the Pacific Northwest, the growing profitability of working-class newspapers led to the development of The Seattle Star, The Spokane Press, The Tacoma Times, and The Portland News, all pitched to dock workers, miners, lumbermen, and cannery workers. By 1905, E.W. estimated that profits on \\"my little Western papers\\" were many times greater than those of his Eastern ones. George H. Scripps died in 1900, leaving behind a will described as \\"a legacy of hate.\\" He gave his shares of Evening News stock to E.W., whom James E. Scripps considered his nemesis. Ellen, meanwhile, received George's shares of the Scripps Publishing Co. This led to an eleven-year legal battle that E.W. and Ellen ultimately won. =Philanthropy= Interested in science and education, Ellen Browning Scripps donated the bulk of her fortune to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Bishop’s School in La Jolla, and the Scripps College in Claremont, California.The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Ellen Browning Scripps She also financed the construction of the La Jolla Women's Club, the La Jolla Recreational Center, Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, and the La Jolla Children's Pool, and she was an important early supporter of the San Diego Zoo. After a stay in the hospital due to a broken hip, Ellen helped to found the Scripps Memorial Hospital and funded the Scripps Research Clinic. These organizations eventually became The Scripps Research Institute, and two of the core providers now comprising Scripps Health—Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla and Scripps Clinic. The New York Times estimated that, during her lifetime, she gave gifts and donations to charitable causes that totaled more than $2 million, a conservative estimate dollars. =Death= Ellen Browning Scripps died in her La Jolla home on August 3, 1932, a few weeks before her ninety-sixth birthday. Shortly thereafter, the leading newspaper trade journal Editor & Publisher praised her contributions to American journalism: \\"Many women have contributed, directly and indirectly, to the development of the American press, but none more influentially and beneficently than Ellen Browning Scripps.\\" The New York Times, meanwhile, recognized her as \\"one of the pioneers in modern American journalism.\\" Her obituary described her as a woman who had perfected \\"the art of living\\" as well as the art of giving. Legacy La Jolla Woman's Club The Old Scripps Building at UC San Diego Scripps was nominated and inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2007 hosted by the Women's Museum of California; Commission on the Status of Women; University of California, San Diego Women's Center; and San Diego State University Women's Studies. Scripps College Kelp tank (Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 2007) From the 1920s, Scripps was the major benefactor of the San Diego Natural History Museum, financing its building and education programs. In 1933, the Scripps estate donated over 1,000 watercolor paintings of California wildflowers by A. R. Valentien to the San Diego Natural History Museum.

In statistics, a Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. First, the set of intervals for the quantiles is chosen. A point on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (-coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the number of the interval for the quantile. If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on the line . If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line . Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions. A Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model.Gnanadesikan (1977) p199. This can provide an assessment of \\"goodness of fit\\" that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary. Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other. Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal. The term \\"probability plot\\" sometimes refers specifically to a Q–Q plot, sometimes to a more general class of plots, and sometimes to the less commonly used P–P plot. The probability plot correlation coefficient plot (PPCC plot) is a quantity derived from the idea of Q–Q plots, which measures the agreement of a fitted distribution with observed data and which is sometimes used as a means of fitting a distribution to data.  Definition and construction  Q–Q plot for first opening/final closing dates of Washington State Route 20, versus a normal distribution. Outliers are visible in the upper right corner. A Q–Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other, or a plot based on estimates of the quantiles. The pattern of points in the plot is used to compare the two distributions. The main step in constructing a Q–Q plot is calculating or estimating the quantiles to be plotted. If one or both of the axes in a Q–Q plot is based on a theoretical distribution with a continuous cumulative distribution function (CDF), all quantiles are uniquely defined and can be obtained by inverting the CDF. If a theoretical probability distribution with a discontinuous CDF is one of the two distributions being compared, some of the quantiles may not be defined, so an interpolated quantile may be plotted. If the Q–Q plot is based on data, there are multiple quantile estimators in use. Rules for forming Q–Q plots when quantiles must be estimated or interpolated are called plotting positions. A simple case is where one has two data sets of the same size. In that case, to make the Q–Q plot, one orders each set in increasing order, then pairs off and plots the corresponding values. A more complicated construction is the case where two data sets of different sizes are being compared. To construct the Q–Q plot in this case, it is necessary to use an interpolated quantile estimate so that quantiles corresponding to the same underlying probability can be constructed. More abstractly, given two cumulative probability distribution functions and , with associated quantile functions and (the inverse function of the CDF is the quantile function), the Q–Q plot draws the -th quantile of against the -th quantile of for a range of values of . Thus, the Q–Q plot is a parametric curve indexed over [0,1] with values in the real plane .  Interpretation  The points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right. If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line . If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line . If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line , the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis. Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line , the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis. Q–Q plots are often arced, or \\"S\\" shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other. Although a Q–Q plot is based on quantiles, in a standard Q–Q plot it is not possible to determine which point in the Q–Q plot determines a given quantile. For example, it is not possible to determine the median of either of the two distributions being compared by inspecting the Q–Q plot. Some Q–Q plots indicate the deciles to make determinations such as this possible. The intercept and slope of a linear regression between the quantiles gives a measure of the relative location and relative scale of the samples. If the median of the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is 0, the intercept of a regression line is a measure of location, and the slope is a measure of scale. The distance between medians is another measure of relative location reflected in a Q–Q plot. The \\"probability plot correlation coefficient\\" (PPCC plot) is the correlation coefficient between the paired sample quantiles. The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the closer the distributions are to being shifted, scaled versions of each other. For distributions with a single shape parameter, the probability plot correlation coefficient plot provides a method for estimating the shape parameter – one simply computes the correlation coefficient for different values of the shape parameter, and uses the one with the best fit, just as if one were comparing distributions of different types. Another common use of Q–Q plots is to compare the distribution of a sample to a theoretical distribution, such as the standard normal distribution , as in a normal probability plot. As in the case when comparing two samples of data, one orders the data (formally, computes the order statistics), then plots them against certain quantiles of the theoretical distribution.  Plotting positions  The choice of quantiles from a theoretical distribution can depend upon context and purpose. One choice, given a sample of size , is for , as these are the quantiles that the sampling distribution realizes. The last of these, , corresponds to the 100th percentile – the maximum value of the theoretical distribution, which is sometimes infinite. Other choices are the use of , or instead to space the points evenly in the uniform distribution, using . Many other choices have been suggested, both formal and heuristic, based on theory or simulations relevant in context. The following subsections discuss some of these. A narrower question is choosing a maximum (estimation of a population maximum), known as the German tank problem, for which similar \\"sample maximum, plus a gap\\" solutions exist, most simply . A more formal application of this uniformization of spacing occurs in maximum spacing estimation of parameters. = Expected value of the order statistic for a uniform distribution = The approach equals that of plotting the points according to the probability that the last of () randomly drawn values will not exceed the -th smallest of the first randomly drawn values. = Expected value of the order statistic for a standard normal distribution = In using a normal probability plot, the quantiles one uses are the rankits, the quantile of the expected value of the order statistic of a standard normal distribution. More generally, Shapiro–Wilk test uses the expected values of the order statistics of the given distribution; the resulting plot and line yields the generalized least squares estimate for location and scale (from the intercept and slope of the fitted line).Testing for Normality, by Henry C. Thode, CRC Press, 2002, , p. 31 Although this is not too important for the normal distribution (the location and scale are estimated by the mean and standard deviation, respectively), it can be useful for many other distributions. However, this requires calculating the expected values of the order statistic, which may be difficult if the distribution is not normal. = Median of the order statistics = Alternatively, one may use estimates of the median of the order statistics, which one can compute based on estimates of the median of the order statistics of a uniform distribution and the quantile function of the distribution; this was suggested by . This can be easily generated for any distribution for which the quantile function can be computed, but conversely the resulting estimates of location and scale are no longer precisely the least squares estimates, though these only differ significantly for small. = Heuristics = Several different formulas have been used or proposed as affine symmetrical plotting positions. Such formulas have the form for some value of in the range from 0 to 1, which gives a range between and . Expressions include:  .. The plotting of observations on probability paper.

For large sample size, , there is little difference between these various expressions. = Filliben's estimate = The order statistic medians are the medians of the order statistics of the distribution. These can be expressed in terms of the quantile function and the order statistic medians for the continuous uniform distribution by: : N(i) = G(U(i)) where are the uniform order statistic medians and is the quantile function for the desired distribution. The quantile function is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (probability that is less than or equal to some value). That is, given a probability, we want the corresponding quantile of the cumulative distribution function. James J. Filliben uses the following estimates for the uniform order statistic medians: : m(i) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 - 0.5^{1/n} & i = 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{i - 0.3175}{n + 0.365} & i = 2, 3, \\\\ldots, n-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.5^{1/n} & i = n.\\\\end{cases} The reason for this estimate is that the order statistic medians do not have a simple form.

She served during the French Revolution and was promoted to Leutnant (lieutenant) in 1800. In 1801 she left the army and was granted a pension by Kaiser Franz II, when he learned of her story. Life Born in Milan in 1776, which was then under Austrian rule, Scanagatta dreamt of joining the Imperial Austrian army. Fortunately, she was said to be \\"ugly and small, with a moustache that had developed through repeated shaving.\\" Born with a rather weak body, she did exercises throughout her childhood to develop her muscles. She also read widely and went to an excellent convent school - apparently, all this exercising of her mind and body made her feel \\"like a man.\\"\\"Europe and Me Magazine\\" No.33, article by Lucy Duggan =Military studies= Scanagatta's brother Giacomo was very different from her; he had always been quite effeminate. He was supposed to go to Vienna and train to become a soldier, but he confided in her that this was the last thing he wanted. Francesca made the most of a great opportunity: in 1794, dressed as a man, she travelled with Giacomo to Vienna and on 1 July, she joined the Theresian Military Academy in his place as a \\"externer Hörer\\" (external student - new to the army). When he realized what had happened, Francesca's father was flabbergasted and intended to go to Wiener Neustadt to bring her home, but she was so ardent in her wish to be an officer that he relented and allowed her to remain at the academy, where she gained excellent grades and graduated on 16 January 1797 as a Fähnrich (cadet/ensign).Militär-Zeitung 23 January 1865 =Military service= In that rank, Scanagatta joined the 6th composite Battalion, Warasdin Grenz District (combined Infanterie Regimenter No. 65 & 66), leading a reinforcement troop from Hungary to the battalion at Kehl on the Rhine just as the war ended in April 1797. In December, she marched with them to winter quarters in Troppau, Silesia and then to Klagenfurt in Styria. Always taking great care not to be discovered and trying to be amongst new people, she took the opportunity to take up a fellow cadet's posting to Infantry Regiment No.56 'Wenzel Graf Colloredo' in the autumn of 1798. She also fulfilled her wish to see various parts of the Empire, as she first visited the regiment's base in Moravia before joining the 'Aushilfsbezirk' (supplementary recruiting area) for the regiment in Galicia, where she arrived in September. She would regularly frequent the casino in Sandomir, where local society would gather, and was almost discovered when challenged by a local young man, who told her that some women thought Scanagatta was a woman. Her response was that she was glad to be judged by his wife, which was enough to persuade him to disbelieve the gossip.Militär-Zeitung 23 January 1865 In February 1799, she marched with her company to the War of the Second Coalition, but en route suffered a severe attack of rheumatism. After two months' ill health and recuperation, she was transferred to the Deutsch-Banater Grenz Regiment No.12 and travelled to its base at Pancsova in the area, which is now northern Serbia. With GR12, Scanagatta marched to Italy, where she continued to show her determination and endured exhausting marches, relying on her motto: \\"Una verace risoluta virtù non trova impresa impossibile a lei\\" (Real strength of mind finds nothing impossible.) When one of Francesca's army comrades teased her for being small, she challenged him to a duel and wounded him. In December 1799, she led the attack on the French trenches at Barbagelata. Over the winter, she spent time with her family and they tried to persuade her to leave the army. Promoted to Leutnant in March 1800, Francesca returned to the siege of Genoa in April, but her father informed the Austrian authorities of his daughter's presence in the army. She was obliged to resign on the very day Genoa fell, 4 June 1800. Her commander, Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim held a party in her honour, where she was still treated as an ordinary officer. =Later life= Back in Milan, Scanagatta met Lieutenant Spini of the Italian Presidential (later Royal) guard, whom she married on 16 January 1804. They had four children, two boys and two girls, and when the boys were old enough, they were allowed to wear their mother's medals, which she wasn't allowed to wear. She died aged 89.Militär-Zeitung 23 January 1865 Her painting hangs in the Neustadt Academy 'The Austrian Officer at Work and at Play' Dorothea Gerard 2001 p.187 See also * Johanna Sophia Kettner * Eleonore Prochaska * Marie Schellinck References * \\"Gendered War and Military\\", last accessed February 10, 2006 * \\"Austria's Military Academy Founded By Maria Theresa\\", last accessed February 10, 2006 * \\"Women Soldiers: The Historical Record\\", last accessed March 10, 2006 * \\"Europe and Me Magazine\\" No.33, article by Lucy Duggan, last accessed August 11 2016 * Militär-Zeitung 23 January 1865 Female wartime cross-dressers Italian military personnel in Austrian armies Women in 18th-century warfare Women in 19th-century warfare 18th-century Italian women 19th-century Italian women Italian people of the French Revolutionary Wars Austrian Empire military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Women in European warfare 1776 births 1865 deaths ","title":"Franziska Scanagatta"},{"id":"4031882","text":"Single-loss expectancy (SLE) is the monetary value expected from the occurrence of a risk on an asset.

Name The rendering of his name Danske Bo (\\"Bo the Dane\\") into Medieval Latin as Boetius de Dacia stems from the fact that the toponym Dania, meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with Dacia during the Middle Ages. Life and accomplishments Boetius was born in the first half of the 13th century. Not much is known of his early life. The attempt to connect him to known persons from Denmark or Sweden has been unsuccessful.Boethius de Dacia, Verdens evighed, Det lille forlag, 2001, p. 8 (in Danish) All that is known is that he went to France to teach philosophy at the University of Paris. At the university, he associated with Siger of Brabant. He continued to teach for some time as arts masters rather than quickly moving on to study in the theology faculty or finding non-academic employment. He shared this unusual career path with Siger and others like Roger Bacon and Jean Buridan. He was condemned by Stephen Tempier in 1277 for being a leading member of the Averroist movement. Boetius fled Paris with Siger and appealed to Pope Nicholas III. He was detained at the pontifical curia at Orvieto. He went on to join the Dominicans in Denmark. Boetius was a follower of Aristotle and Averroes. He wrote on logic, natural philosophy, metaphysics, and ethics, though some of his works have not survived. His central position was that philosophy had to follow where the arguments led, regardless of their conflict with religious faith. For him, philosophy was the supreme human activity, and in this world only philosophers attained wisdom. In his book On the Highest Good, or On the Life of the Philosopher he offers a fervently Aristotelian description of man's highest good as the rational contemplation of truth and virtue. Among the controversial conclusions that he reached are the impossibility of creation ex nihilo, the eternity of the world and of the human race, and that there could be no resurrection of the dead. Despite his radical views, Boetius remained a Christian; he attempted to reconcile his religious beliefs with his philosophical positions by assigning the investigation of the world and of human nature to philosophy, while to religion he assigned supernatural revelation and divine miracles. He was condemned for holding the doctrine of \\"double truth\\", though he was careful to avoid calling philosophical conclusions that ran contrary to religion true simpliciter: in each branch of knowledge, one must be careful to qualify one's conclusions. The conclusions that the philosopher reaches are true \\"according to natural causes and principles\\" (De Aeternitate Mundi, p. 351).

It consists of two ABWRs each of 1,300 MWe net. It is owned by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower). It was intended to be the first of these advanced Generation III reactors built outside Japan. In 2014 construction of the plant was deferred. The preceding four reactors in Japan were completed in four to five years. Taipower, however, did not award the contract as a turnkey plant, but hired General Electric to build the reactors, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to supply the turbines and the generators, and other contractors for the rest, making the project very difficult to manage. In addition, the project was canceled in 2000 by the government when it was 10-30% complete, only to restart the following year. All these have resulted in significant cost overruns, while in 2011 the Taiwan Atomic Energy Council (AEC) criticized Taipower's management of the project. The construction has been delayed by legal, regulatory and political delays. The proposed 2014 national referendum to decide the fate of the power plant was rejected from the ballot for contradictory and confusing language, despite gathering more than 120,000 signatures. In 2018, Taipower started shipping unused fuel rods back to the US. Taipower aims to remove all fuel rods from the plant by 2020. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party plans to shut down all nuclear plants in Taiwan by 2025. The removal of the fuel rods may mean that the plant's construction will never be restarted.http://m.focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201809050007.aspxhttp://m.focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201807040018.aspx History The Fourth Nuclear Power Plant was first proposed in 1978, and Taipower selected the ABWR in 1996 after a competitive bidding process. The reactor is designed by General Electric, but is supported by Hitachi, Shimizu Corporation, Toshiba, and other American, Taiwanese, and other Chinese and international companies. =Construction= Construction of the plant began in 1999 and was expected to be completed in 2004. Delays in construction (some for political reasons) have increased the cost of the project. Costs have also increased from increases in the costs of raw materials from 2003. The 921 earthquake in 1999 prompted three legislators to inspect construction progress; they cited rusty rebar and potential seawater seepage into the plant's foundation as potential issues. President Chen Shui-bian was elected along with other Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators in March 2000 on an anti-nuclear platform which included stopping plant construction. DPP legislators called for a halt to the project in April 2000, which led to the suspension of construction in October 2000 by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung. Contractors were idled for 111 days from 2000 October 27 to 14 February 2001. This delay caused a 576-day delay towards commercial operation. Taipower constructed a wharf in 2003 to accommodate delivery of heavy components, such as the reactor vessel. The wharf was beset with construction delays and may have contributed to local beach erosion, prompting further protests. Each reactor vessel delivery was greeted with activist protests and construction delays resulted in the vessels being stored longer than expected, with Unit 1's reactor vessel not installed until 2005. Design of the plant was carried out by Stone & Webster (S&W;), but Taipower canceled its contract with S&W; in 2007, leading to protracted litigation from 2007 to 2011. In 2010, aboriginal artifacts were found at the construction site, prompting calls to halt construction again. Taipower was fined by the AEC twice, in 2008 and 2011, for completing design changes without first obtaining approval from the plant's designer, General Electric. Taipower later stated the changes were executed to stay on schedule, and approval was later obtained from GE for 97% of the changes. The temporary cancellation by the Government and other project management difficulties caused significant delays, pushing the price tag of the plant to more than US$7.5 billion in 2009. , the total price tag was close to US$10 billion, or NT$300 billion. In August 2014, the plant completed its safety tests required before operation can begin. 126 systems were tested including cooling, shutdown, containment, control and power generation. Minister of Economic Affairs Chang Chia-juch said, \\"Passing the rigorous review illustrates the high standards of care invested in the design and construction of the facility.\\" The reactor will be closed until the status is decided by referendum. In the meantime, the reactor costs 1.3 billion NT Dollars a year to maintain in a mothballed state. Construction of Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant =2013 and 2014 referendums= Environmental groups called for a national referendum in April 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. By obtaining the signatures of a certain percentage of registered voters, or by legislative action, a referendum may be referred to the national ballot for voter action. However, due to the politically sensitive nature of the Fourth Nuclear Plant issue, legislatively-referred and voter-referred referendums have failed to enter the national ballot. Because of the controversy over the plant, in February 2013 the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government proposed that a referendum should be issued, which would allow the people of the country to decide the fate of the plant. The proposed referendum was sponsored by 32 KMT lawmakers led by Lee Ching-hua and asked \\"Do you agree that the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should be halted and that it not become operational?\\" Referendums must have good voter turnout (greater than 50% of registered voters must participate in the referendum vote), and a majority of participating voters must vote yes in order for the referendum to become binding, meaning that poor voter turnout would ensure referendum defeat (and in the case of the Lee referendum, continued construction). The opposition DPP claimed that getting better than 50% voter turnout in a non-Presidential election year was too difficult, and barricaded the legislative chamber to prevent a vote to place the Lee referendum on the national ballot. This led to a scuffle when KMT legislators attempted to break through the barricade, and the Lee referendum was not voted on. In the following legislative session, protesters called on the government to withdraw the Lee referendum, and it was subsequently withdrawn. Annette Lu used the local referendum process to debate the plant's fate as early as 2012. Her petition for a local referendum gathered 50,000 signatures by March 2013, but the proposed referendum was rejected by the Executive Yuan Referendum Review Committee in May 2013, ruling the issue was of national importance, and could not be decided by local referendum. She launched another local referendum in June 2013 in opposition to the KMT-authored Lee referendum. Meanwhile, Lu filed suit in 2014 in the Taipei High Administrative Court over the Executive Yuan's rejection of the earlier referendum. The court's decision is expected in August 2014. A competing referendum was launched in 2012 by National Taiwan University professor Kao Cheng-yan, initially as a local referendum and then a national one in July 2014, once sufficient signatures had been gathered. The language of the Kao referendum was formulated to require positive action: \\"Do you agree to allow Taiwan Power Co to insert fuel rods into the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City for a test run\\" so poor voter turnout would result in referendum defeat, and thus create binding opposition to starting the plant. In April 2014, the government decided to halt construction. The first reactor was sealed after the completion of safety checks, and construction of the second reactor was halted. A final decision on whether to proceed with construction would be subject to another referendum. The ruling KMT stated the purpose of a new referendum was to have the people decide the plant's fate while weighing the consequences of not bringing a major power source on-line. Electricity prices are estimated to rise by 14–40%, and electricity rationing could be imposed as early as 2021. Completely cancelling the plant would force Taipower to book the construction budget as a total loss and force it into insolvency. Meanwhile, also in April 2014, the opposition DPP planned to introduce special legislation to bypass the provisions of the Referendum Act, allowing a simple majority vote (with no threshold of participation) to decide the plant's fate. Premier Jiang Yi-huah cited the prior 2000 precedent when construction was interrupted by executive order which was later ruled unconstitutional as the reason why he rejected the proposed special legislation. The Executive Yuan stated the plant could start operations if the referendum on halting construction was not held, assuming safety tests were passed first. Former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung went on a hunger strike for two weeks to oppose continued construction, reflecting a popular poll, which favored lowering the threshold of participation and opposed continued construction. The proposed Kao referendum was rejected by the Executive Yuan Referendum Review Committee in August 2014, citing the language as confusing and contradictory, since the reason given for the referendum is in opposition to nuclear power, while the referendum itself asks to start a nuclear reactor. Undaunted, supporters of the Kao referendum vowed in October 2014 to initiate another referendum. Past polls in Taiwan have showed more support for nuclear power among educated than uneducated people. The China Times poll taken in 2000 showed 60% support among those with higher degrees, and only 40% among those with only primary education. =Proposed 3 year construction deferment= The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed in August 2014 that construction be halted for three years until a national referendum could be held, with Taipower estimating the three-year cost of sealing Unit 1 as less than 2 billion. In September 2014 Taiwan Power Co. submitted its plan to the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) to mothball Unit 1 and halt construction on Unit 2 of the No. 4 nuclear power plant for three years, beginning in 2015. The plan, written in accordance with the April 2014 government directive to halt construction, underwent several revisions until its final submission in January 2015; the AEC approved Taipower's final plan in February, and it will take effect in July 2015 and run through 2017. Of the 126 systems which passed safety testing, 80 will remain in operation, 14 require periodic testing to ensure they can support their safety functions and 32 will be kept in low-humidity storage. In September 2015 GE started International Court of Arbitration proceedings over withheld payments. Safety A Generation III nuclear reactor has a 72-hour capability of passive cooling to prevent damage to its core should the plant face a total blackout after an emergency shut down. If core overheating and meltdown became unavoidable, these reactors have core catchers that will trap the molten fuel and stop the nuclear reaction (although Lungmen, as other ABWR does not have a core catcher but rely on passive cooling of the corium). Finally, a tight containment ensures that no evacuation zone is required around a Generation III nuclear power plant. The ABWR was designed to a 0.3G earthquake acceleration standard with the Lungmen units seismic hardening increased to 0.4G. =Reliability= Some custom made power plants have lower reliability in the first few years of operation. Some parts may prove unsuitable and need replacement or modifications may be necessary. ABWR uses standardized parts to avoid this, but the 3rd and 4th units displayed low reliability (45% - 70%). It is believed this experience provided knowledge that will give better results in future units. The first two units built, Kashiwazaki Kariwa 6 & 7 fared much better than the following two, Hamaoka 5 and Shika 2.

This technique has two different applications in the earth and environmental sciences. The analysis of 'stable isotopes' is normally concerned with measuring isotopic variations arising from mass-dependent isotopic fractionation in natural systems. On the other hand, radiogenic isotope analysis involves measuring the abundances of decay-products of natural radioactivity, and is used in most long-lived radiometric dating methods. Introduction Schematic of an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer for measuring CO2 The isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) allows the precise measurement of mixtures of naturally occurring isotopes. Most instruments used for precise determination of isotope ratios are of the magnetic sector type. This type of analyzer is superior to the quadrupole type in this field of research for two reasons. First, it can be set up for multiple-collector analysis, and second, it gives high-quality 'peak shapes'. Both of these considerations are important for isotope-ratio analysis at very high precision and accuracy. The sector-type instrument designed by Alfred Nier was such an advance in mass spectrometer design that this type of instrument is often called the 'Nier type'. In the most general terms the instrument operates by ionizing the sample of interest, accelerating it over a potential in the kilo-volt range, and separating the resulting stream of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Beams with lighter ions bend at a smaller radius than beams with heavier ions. The current of each ion beam is then measured using a 'Faraday cup' or multiplier detector. Many radiogenic isotope measurements are made by ionization of a solid source, whereas stable isotope measurements of light elements (e.g. H, C, O) are usually made in an instrument with a gas source. In a \\"multicollector\\" instrument, the ion collector typically has an array of Faraday cups, which allows the simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes. Gas source mass spectrometry Measurement of natural variations in the abundances of stable isotopes of the same element is normally referred to as stable isotope analysis. This field is of interest because the differences in mass between different isotopes leads to isotope fractionation, causing measurable effects on the isotopic composition of samples, characteristic of their biological or physical history. As a specific example, the hydrogen isotope deuterium (heavy hydrogen) is almost double the mass of the common hydrogen isotope. Water molecules containing the common hydrogen isotope (and the common oxygen isotope, mass 16) have a mass of 18. Water incorporating a deuterium atom has a mass of 19, over 5% heavier. The energy to vaporise the heavy water molecule is higher than that to vaporize the normal water so isotope fractionation occurs during the process of evaporation. Thus a sample of sea water will exhibit a quite detectable isotopic-ratio difference when compared to Antarctic snowfall. Samples must be introduced to the mass spectrometer as pure gases, achieved through combustion, gas chromatographic feeds, or chemical trapping. By comparing the detected isotopic ratios to a measured standard, an accurate determination of the isotopic make up of the sample is obtained. For example, carbon isotope ratios are measured relative to the international standard for C. The C standard is produced from a fossil belemnite found in the Peedee Formation, which is a limestone formed in the Cretaceous period in South Carolina, U.S.A. The fossil is referred to as VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and has 13C:12C ratio of 0.0112372. Oxygen isotope ratios are measured relative the standard, V-SMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). Isotope-ratio mass spectrometer used to measure stable isotope ratios, with gas bench in foreground It is critical that the sample be processed before entering the mass spectrometer so that only a single chemical species enters at a given time. Generally, samples are combusted or pyrolyzed and the desired gas species (usually hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), or sulfur dioxide (SO2)) is purified by means of traps, filters, catalysts and/or chromatography. The two most common types of IRMS instruments are continuous flow and dual inlet. In dual inlet IRMS, purified gas obtained from a sample is alternated rapidly with a standard gas (of known isotopic composition) by means of a system of valves, so that a number of comparison measurements are made of both gases. In continuous flow IRMS, sample preparation occurs immediately before introduction to the IRMS, and the purified gas produced from the sample is measured just once. The standard gas may be measured before and after the sample or after a series of sample measurements. While continuous-flow IRMS instruments can achieve higher sample throughput and are more convenient to use than dual inlet instruments, the yielded data is of approximately 10-fold lower precision. Static gas mass spectrometry A static gas mass spectrometer is one in which a gaseous sample for analysis is fed into the source of the instrument and then left in the source without further supply or pumping throughout the analysis. This method can be used for 'stable isotope' analysis of light gases (as above), but it is particularly used in the isotopic analysis of noble gases (rare or inert gases) for radiometric dating or isotope geochemistry. Important examples are argon–argon dating and helium isotope analysis. Thermal ionization mass spectrometry Several of the isotope systems involved in radiometric dating depend on IRMS using thermal ionization of a solid sample loaded into the source of the mass spectrometer (hence thermal ionization mass spectrometry, TIMS). These methods include rubidium–strontium dating, uranium–lead dating, lead–lead dating and samarium–neodymium dating. When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.Dickin, A.P., 2005. Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 21-22. There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization potential, such as Strontium (Sr), and Lead (Pb). The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500 degrees Celsius, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization potential, such as Osmium (Os), and Tungsten (Hf-W). Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization potential can be analyzed more effectively with MC-ICP-MS.

This type of ion- microprobe analysis normally works by focusing a primary (oxygen) ion beam on a sample in order to generate a series of secondary positive ions that can be focused and measured based on their mass/charge ratios. SIMS is a common method used in U-Pb analysis, as the primary ion beam is used to bombard the surface of a single zircon grain in order to yield a secondary beam of Pb ions. The Pb ions are analyzed using a double focusing mass spectrometer that comprises both an electrostatic and magnetic analyzer. This assembly allows the secondary ions to be focused based on their kinetic energy and mass-charge ratio in order to be accurately collected using a series of Faraday cups.Dickin, A. P. (2005). Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press. A major issue that arises in SIMS analysis is the generation of isobaric interference between sputtered molecular ions and the ions of interest. This issue occurs with U–Pb dating as Pb ions have essentially the same mass as HfO2+.Hinton, R.W. and Long, J.V.P. (1979). High resolution ion microprobe measurement of lead isotopes: variations within single zircons from Lac Seul, Northwestern Ontario. Earth Planet. Sci. lett. 45, 309-325., In order to overcome this problem, a sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) can be used. A SHRIMP is a double-focusing mass spectrometer that allows for a large spatial separation between different ion masses based on its relatively large size. For U-Pb analysis, the SHRIMP allows for the separation of Pb from other interfering molecular ions, such as HfO2+. Multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry An MC-ICP- MS instrument is a multiple collector mass spectrometer with a plasma source. MC-ICP-MS was developed to improve the precision achievable by ICP-MS during isotope-ratio measurements. Conventional ICP-MS analysis uses a quadrupole analyser, which only allows single-collector analysis. Due to the inherent instability of the plasma, this limits the precision of ICP-MS with a quadrupole analyzer to around 1%, which is insufficient for most radiogenic isotope systems. Isotope-ratio analysis for radiometric dating has normally been determined by TIMS. However, some systems (e.g. Hf-W and Lu-Hf) are difficult or impossible to analyse by TIMS, due to the high ionization potential of the elements involved. Therefore, these methods can now be analysed using MC-ICP-MS. The Ar-ICP produces an ion-beam with a large inherent kinetic energy distribution, which makes the design of the mass- spectrometer somewhat more complex than it is the case for conventional TIMS instruments. First, different from Quadrupole ICP-MS systems, magnetic sector instruments have to operate with a higher acceleration potential (several 1000 V) in order to minimize the energy distribution of the ion beam. Modern instruments operate at 6-10kV. The radius of deflection of an ion within a magnetic field depends on the kinetic energy and the mass/charge ratio of the ion (strictly, the magnet is a momentum analyzer not just a mass analyzer). Because of the large energy distribution, ions with similar mass/charge ratio can have very different kinetic energies and will thus experience different deflection for the same magnetic field. In practical terms one would see that ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at different points in space. However, in a mass-spectrometer one wants ions with the same mass/charge ratio to focus at the same point, e.g. where the detector is located. In order to overcome these limitations, commercial MC-ICP-MS are double-focusing instruments. In a double-focusing mass-spectrometer ions are focused due to kinetic energy by the ESA (electro-static-analyzer) and kinetic energy + mass/charge (momentum) in the magnetic field. Magnet and ESA are carefully chosen to match the energy focusing properties of one another and are arranged so that the direction of energy focusing is in opposite directions. To simplify, two components have an energy focus term, when arranged properly, the energy term cancels out and ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at the same point in space. It is important to note, double-focusing does not reduce the kinetic energy distribution and different kinetic energies are not filtered or homogenized. Double-focusing works for single as well as multi- collector instruments. In single collector instruments ESA and magnet can be arranged in either forward geometry (first ESA then magnet) or reversed geometry (magnet first then ESA), as only point-to-point focusing is required. In multi-collector instruments, only forward geometry (ESA then magnet) is possible due to the array of detectors and the requirements of a focal plane rather than a focal point. Accelerator mass spectrometry For isotopes occurring at extremely low levels, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) can be used. For example, the decay rate of the radioisotope 14C is widely used to date organic materials, but this approach was once limited to relatively large samples no more than a few thousand years old. AMS extended the range of 14C dating to about 60,000 years BP, and is about 106 times more sensitive than conventional IRMS. AMS works by accelerating negative ions through a large (mega-volt) potential, followed by charge exchange and acceleration back to ground. During charge exchange, interfering species can be effectively removed. In addition, the high energy of the beam allows the use of energy- loss detectors, that can distinguish between species with the same mass/charge ratio. Together, these processes allow the analysis of extreme isotope ratios above 1012. Moving wire IRMS Moving wire IRMS is useful for analyzing Carbon-13 ratios of compounds in a solution, such as after purification by liquid chromatography. The solution (or outflow from the chromatography) is dried onto a nickel or stainless steel wire. After the residue is deposited on the wire, it enters a furnace where the sample is converted to CO2 and water by combustion. The gas stream finally enters a capillary, is dried, ionized, and analyzed. This process allows a mixture of compounds to be purified and analyzed continuously, which can decrease the analysis time by a factor of four. Moving wire IRMS is quite sensitive, and samples containing as little as 1 nano-mole of Carbon can yield precise (within 1‰) results.

From Harvest Cottage, near the East Coast main railway line, the southern boundary of the parish is also the boundary of Bassetlaw. It meets Weston and follows Goosemoor Dyke. To the south, in Newark and Sherwood, is Egmanton, on the opposite side of Goosemoor Dyke. At the point where the boundary crosses the railway to Ollerton, it meets Kirton. At Priors Park Farm where it crosses the A6075, it meets Walesby (in Newark and Sherwood). At Willoughby Hill next to the British Telecom mast, on south of Farleys Wood, the parish boundary leaves the district boundary of Bassetlaw, and it meets West Markham. Directly south of West Markham, the boundary meets East Markham and to the east is Fledborough. Tuxford in Bassetlaw The Great North Road runs through the village (now B1164), though the majority of traffic now uses the modern A1 trunk road, which splits the village in two. The village was bypassed in July 1967, opened by Stephen Swingler. The section of road, known as Carlton to Markham Moor, or the Sutton-on-Trent, Weston and Tuxford Bypass, was built by Robert McGregor & Sons, with concreting aggregates supplied by Hoveringham Gravels (later bought by Tarmac). The eight-mile section was authorised by Tom Fraser with a contract for £2.7 million, but ended up costing £3.4 million. The section is notable for the first use in British construction of the slip form paver using pervious concrete. The bridge sections came from Boulton & Paul Ltd in Norwich. The A6075 passes through east–west and connects the A57 to Ollerton and Mansfield. The East Coast Main Line passes close to the east. The A611 previously went east–west through the village; this is now the A6075; the A611 now goes from Mansfield to Hucknall. History Tuxford is listed in the Domesday Book as Tuxfarne, and was also historically known as 'Tuckers Ford'. In Daniel Defoe's eighteenth century work, A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, Tuxford is referred to as 'Tuxford in the Clays'; Defoe writes: 'Passing Newark Bridge, we went through the lower side of Nottinghamshire, keeping within the River Idle. Here we saw Tuxford in the Clays, that is to say, Tuxford in the Dirt, and a little dirty market town it is, suitable to its name.'

Edward Bishop Elliott, a distinguished theologian who, while in residence at Tuxford, authored an authoritative and widely read commentary on the biblical Book of Revelation, titled Horae Apocalypticae. Tuxford also has a Methodist church, whose current building was erected for another Free church in 1841. Tuxford's local library is housed in a 17th-century building that was originally the Read Grammar School. The school was founded in 1669 by the bequest of Charles Read (1604–1669), who was born at Darlton about from Tuxford, and became a wealthy shipper in Hull. Students at the Free Grammar School were drawn from the local parish, and their education was free. Read also founded grammar schools at Corby Glen in Lincolnshire and Drax in Yorkshire. Read Grammar School in Tuxford closed in either 1912http://www.ceramike.com/tuxford/thesis.html or 1915. The building served for a time as a child welfare centre before becoming the local library. Tuxford Lock Up Tuxford has a village lock-up: one of only three in Nottinghamshire. Built in 1823 it stands on the village green in Newcastle Street. It has two separate cells, one each for men and women, each with its own earth closet. Ventilation to each cell is via two circular holes, with iron bars on the front and back walls. In 1884 an extension was added to the back of the lock-up to house Tuxford's fire engine. Early maps show that also behind the lock-up was the village pinfold, which remained in use until the 1920s. Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (Dosco) make mining equipment in the village. Tuxford Windmill is a tower windmill, built in 1820 and restored to working order between 1982 and 1993. It is open to visitors daily except Tuesdays throughout the year. The mill with its large white sails dominates Tuxford's skyline. The mill produces flour which is sold from the mill shop. The mill bakery produces cakes, soups & rolls. A wooden post mill once stood close by. It was moved from Grassthorpe in 1874, continued working until about 1926 and was demolished in 1950. Stone Road End Mill was a brick-built four- storey tower windmill, built before 1840. The mill was out of use by 1906 and now only the 38-foot high tower remains.Shaw, T. (1995). Windmills of Nottinghamshire. Page 39. Nottingham: Nottinghamshire County Council. In January 1454, Tuxford was the site of a meeting between the Duke of Exeter and Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, in order to make a sworn confederation in furtherance of their common aims against the Neville family and Lord Cromwell. This was a critical alliance and event in ramping up the violence and tension of the period, which would help lead to the outbreak of the Cousins War (Wars of the Roses) in 1455. =Railway stations= Former railway stations Despite its small size, Tuxford had three railway stations but all are now closed. The Great Northern Railway opened the East Coast Main Line through Tuxford in 1852. The GNR's station at Tuxford was served by local trains between Newark- on-Trent and Retford. In 1897 The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway opened its line through Tuxford, linking Sheffield and Chesterfield with Lincoln. The LDECR called its station Tuxford Town, and the GNR renamed its station Tuxford North. In 1907 the Great Central Railway took over the LDECR and renamed Tuxford Town Tuxford Central. Dukeries Junction station was built where the two railways cross, and was a split-level affair with platforms on both lines, existing solely as an interchange point surrounded by open fields with no proper road access. Its name was taken from The Dukeries district of Nottinghamshire. In March 1950 British Railways closed Dukeries Junction station. It had had minimal use throughout its life. In July 1955 BR closed Tuxford North and withdrew passenger services from the former LDECR line in September of the same year, resulting in the closure of Tuxford Central. The former LD&ECR; railway line has since been reopened by Network Rail in 2009 as the High Marnham Test Track for testing trains between Thoresby Jn and High Marnham at speeds of up to 75 mph, with extensive sidings and mock OHL electrification being built at Tuxford approximately 5 miles away from the former Tuxford Central Station.

Education Tuxford Academyhttp://www.tuxfordschool.com/ opened as a County Secondary School (secondary modern school) in 1958 and became a comprehensive in 1976. It performs very well compared with most of Nottinghamshire, and especially with most of Bassetlaw. Tuxford School recently underwent a full re-build, completed in March 2007. A company called Transform Schools (mainly represented by building company Balfour Beatty) spent millions of pounds re- building six secondary schools within the Bassetlaw area as part of a PFI funded project. The new Tuxford School is located on what used to be the old school field along with a field next to it which has been bought over. The site where the old school stood has now been converted into the new school playing field and nature areas. Former grammar school Tuxford Academy has, surprisingly, only had four head teachers during its lifetime to date: Bernard Woodward, Keith Atkinson, Geoff Lloyd, and Chris Pickering and current principal, David Cotton. The school has steadily increased in size (now 1450 students) and reputation, and is one of the highest performing state secondary schools in Nottinghamshire, having gained an OfSTED grade of 'outstanding' in May 2009 and in May 2012. It has been designated as a National Support School, is a specialist Technology College and Training School, and leads loose federations of secondary and primary schools in Nottinghamshire. It is well known for its welcoming atmosphere and innovative practices in education. Tuxford also has a community primary school.http://www.schoolsnet.com/uk- schools/school-details-reviews/nottinghamshire/tuxford-primary-school-early- years-centre/16180339/0/205047.html Sport Tuxford has four youth football teams. Tuxford Gladiatorshttp://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/tuxfordgladiators are an U9s team and Tuxford YFC are under 14s both teams compete in the Newark Youth League. These two teams are managed by a local firefighter and police sergeant. Tuxford YFC under 15s also play in the Mansfield League and the under 12s play in Newark. The footballer Craig Disley comes from Tuxford. He played for Mansfield Town 1999–2004 and now plays for Alfreton Town.

He is most well known as Mr. Peppermint, a role he played for 30 years as the host of one of the longest-running local children's shows in television, the Dallas-based Mr. Peppermint (1961-1969), which was retitled Peppermint Place for its second run (1975-1996). He also had a long career in local and regional theater and appeared in more than 50 films. A 1944 graduate of Dallas' Woodrow Wilson High School, he was the father of Butthole Surfers frontman Gibby Haynes.\\"The Candy Man,\\" by Joe Nick Patoski, Texas Monthly July 1996 Early life He was born in Dallas, Texas to Louise Schimmelpfennig Haynes and Fred Haynes.Jerome Martin Haynes, \\"Texas, Birth Index, 1903-1997\\". FamilySearch. Retrieved 2013-09-04. In 1990, Haynes was inducted into Woodrow Wilson High School's Hall of Fame. Jerry graduated from Southern Methodist University after attending Louisiana State University and Yale. Family Jerry was father of Butthole Surfers frontman, Gibby Haynes, and his brother was Major General Fred E. Haynes Jr., USMC. Acting career =The \\"Mr. Peppermint\\" years= Haynes began his most famous role in 1961, playing a character who wore a red- and white-striped jacket and straw hat and carried a candy-striped magic cane. The original show ran for nine years as a live show, with Mr. Peppermint talking with a variety of puppet characters and including everything from cartoons to French lessons. Early in the run of his show, an accident of fate made Haynes the first to report the Kennedy assassination on local news, together with his program director, Jay Watson. During lunch on the day of the shooting, the two men watched the Presidential motorcade pass on Main Street, and less than a minute later heard the deadly shots after the limousine turned onto Elm Street. The men quickly located and interviewed eyewitnesses, going on the air shortly later: During these early years, the show began at 7:30 AM and ran for one hour, competing in its last half-hour with the national CBS broadcast of Captain Kangaroo but usually winning its time slot. National trends shifted, however, and in 1970, the show was replaced by a talk program for the adult audience. After the Federal Communications Commission called in 1975 for more educational programming for children, the show was retooled as \\"Peppermint Place,\\" a taped half-hour magazine-style program. The show continued in that format for over 20 years, eventually being syndicated to 108 markets nationwide before ending its run in 1996. =Other television and film work= Haynes in the 2007 Red River, New Mexico Fourth of July parade, riding in his trademark Jeep Wrangler painted with candy stripes Most of Haynes' film career was in made-for- television films, especially those set in his native Texas. His first film role was in the 1981 docudrama Crisis at Central High, about the integration of Little Rock's Central High School, filmed in Dallas. Texas-themed films in which he has appeared -- mostly based on true stories -- include Houston: The Legend of Texas (1986), A Killing in a Small Town (1990, aka Evidence of Love), Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story (1992), Texas Justice (1995), Don't Look Back (1996), and It's in the Water (1997). His chief feature film roles included 1984's Places in the Heart, as Deputy Jack Driscoll, and in the 1985 Patsy Cline biopic Sweet Dreams as Owen Bradley, Cline's record producer. He also played minor roles in RoboCop (1987) and Boys Don't Cry (1999). He also appeared as himself, partly through archive footage, in four documentary films discussing the Kennedy assassination: Rush to Judgment (1967), 11-22-63: The Day the Nation Cried (1989), Stalking the President: A History of American Assassins (1992), and Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film (1998). In 1996 the Lone Star Film & Television Awards honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. He regularly appeared in the Red River, New Mexico, Fourth of July parade in a candy-striped Jeep. Health Haynes was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in early 2008, and then was later diagnosed with a heart condition for which he received an artificial pacemaker. His doctors later revised their opinions to determine that he had a less aggressive form of Parkinson's. Haynes died on September 26, 2011, from complications due to the diseases. He was 84.

Polk Cultural Center at 505 Deaderick Street in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, occupying an entire city block between 5th and 6th Avenues North and Deaderick and Union Streets. The cultural center adjoins the 18-story James K. Polk State Office Building. History In the early 1800s, the site was where the fourth mayor of Nashville, Joseph T. Elliston, lived with his wife Louisa and their son William R. Elliston until they moved to Burlington, their plantation in mid-town Nashville. The idea for a large-scale performing arts facility developed in 1972 when Martha Rivers Ingram was appointed to the advisory board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. She proposed a similar center for her home city of Nashville. Ingram's proposal involved a public-private partnership that would operate within a state-owned facility. Her idea met with considerable resistance, but she persevered—for eight years and during the terms of three governors. The result was the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, a three-theater facility located beneath a state office building across the street from the Tennessee State Capitol. In 1980, TPAC opened as the state's premier theater venue. Among its many operations, TPAC presents a series of touring Broadway shows and special engagements, and administers a comprehensive education program. Martha Rivers Ingram and her supporters also raised an endowment to defray operating losses and to fund a program that grooms future audiences for TPAC performances. The endowment goal was $3.5 million, and they surpassed it, raising $5 million. Today, the endowment has grown to $20 million. Each year, more than 100,000 students, from kindergarten through 12th grade, are brought to Nashville for performances by Nashville Ballet, the Nashville Opera, and the Tennessee Repertory Theatre, which are all resident performing arts groups of TPAC and provide year-round programming. Other companies also use TPAC's facilities for plays, dance performances, concerts and other cultural programs. The Tennessee Performing Arts Center Management Corporation is governed by a 27-member Board of Directors. Directors serve for a term of three years. Performance venues The performance venues are named for the three Presidents of the United States who hailed from Tennessee: =Andrew Jackson Hall= Andrew Jackson Hall is the largest of TPAC's multi-purpose theaters with a seating capacity of 2,472 seats, including 47 pit seats. The stage is more than 130 feet wide by 53 feet deep. The stage has a proscenium opening of more than 57 feet by 36 feet. Up to 112 performers can be accommodated in 14 dressing rooms, including a star suite, two onstage quick change rooms, and high- capacity choral spaces. Expansive wings, fly space, rigging and catwalks provide for productions of every kind - from Broadway's biggest tours to award shows, stylish television specials, and major concerts. =James K. Polk Theater= TPAC's Polk Theater James K. Polk Theater is amazingly intimate for its size, with a seating capacity of 1,075 seats, including 44 pit seats. The stage is more than 87 feet by 50 feet, with a proscenium opening of nearly 47 feet by 30 feet. The theater features spacious wings and expansive fly space. Up to 86 performers can be accommodated in 10 dressing rooms, including one quick change room and two high-capacity choral spaces. =Andrew Johnson Theater= TPAC's Johnson Theater Andrew Johnson Theater is TPAC's smallest theater, ideal for adventurous and experimental art and entertainment. The 59 feet by 54 feet center open floor performing space is surrounded by three sides with banks of theater seating. With seating up to 256 configurable seats, this theater can host a variety of seating arrangements. Wing and storage space adjoin the theater, which features a 22-foot catwalk. Two dressing rooms can accommodate up to 24 performers. Designed for live theater and intimate performances, Johnson Theater has hosted a variety of acoustic concerts, \\"in the round\\" performances, readings, lectures and video shoots. =War Memorial Auditorium= TPAC also governs the War Memorial Auditorium (1,661 seats), a historic building that anchors the War Memorial Plaza, adjacent to Nashville's capitol building and across 6th Avenue from the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.

It has a number of space flight simulators. Space Center logo The center, named for educator Christa McAuliffe, killed in Challenger disaster, was started in 1990 by Victor Williamson, an educator at Central Elementary School. It is a building added onto Central Elementary. It aims to teach astronomy and social studies through the use of simulators; the first, Voyager, proved itself popular. As the years passed, the demand for flights expanded and new ships were commissioned. In October 2012, the space center was temporarily closed at Central Elementary,http://voyagerslog.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-school-district-has- released.html but re-opened following several district-mandated upgrades, closures, and maintenance procedures in Spring 2013. The original simulators, along with the school that housed them, was demolished on May 5, 2020 to make way for a new space center built behind the original property. The simulators employed by the center have included the following (in order of original construction): *The Voyager (Original 1990) (Decommissioned 2012/2013, New 2018) The Voyager appears as the USS Enterprise-D. It held from nine to eleven people. *The Odyssey (Original 1995, New 2013) The Odyssey's appearance was created by Paul S. Cargile, an independent sci-fi artist. It takes on the appearance of the Banzai-class fighter. It holds six to eight people. *The Galileo (Original Mark-5: 1998, New Mark-6: 2009) The Galileo is a shuttlecraft. It differs from the other simulators because it can physically be seen from the outside. It can hold five to six people. *The Magellan (Original Space Station: 1998, Renovated: 2006, Starship: 2012) – The Magellan had the appearance of Deep Space 9. The Magellan has been transformed into a starship with the appearance of a Daedalus-class starship from Stargate. The bridge crew can be anywhere from ten to thirteen people. *The Falcon (2000) (Decommissioned) – The Falcon showed students what space travel might be like in the future. *The Phoenix (2005) – The Phoenix is a Defiant-class escort, like DS9's USS Defiant. It is the Space Center's only battleship. It can hold five to six crew members. Each simulator also has its own plaque. The plaque displays the ship's names and other things about that specific simulator. Some are inside the simulator, and some of them are hidden out of plain sight. Most missions are based on, or at least contain aspects similar to the Star Trek universe. The Simulators themselves are replicas of Star Trek ships and various races (like the Romulans) are often involved in missions. The center, and its founder were honored in a ceremony in its 15th year by many individuals, including Gary Herbert, the Lieutenant Governor of Utah. At that time, with its five spaceship simulators, it was educating 16,000 students a year. The center's mission statement is A Utah Arts, Sciences, Technology Education Initiative. We Practice the Discipline of Wonder. https://spacecenter.alpineschools.org/  Teaching method  The Space Center uses it simulators in order to create interactive stories, usually applicable to historical events, in which the students are involved. Students also learn and apply different aspects of astronomy and science in missions. They get the chance to learn about black holes, nebulae, asteroids, planets, planetary systems, moons, and a variety of other phenomena. Students who attended the Space Center 15 years ago are now pursuing fields in science, technology, space exploration, programming, and electrical engineering. Students at the local Brigham Young University have the opportunity to develop consoles and equipment for the Space Center; gadgets such as Tricorders, touch panel equipment, fiber optics systems, ships, and digital/analog control interfaces all help to give a more realistic effect to the experience. The center's staff hopes that its visitors are tomorrow's scientists. Technology The Space Center employs technologies and equipment to achieve its simulations. In each ship, there is a powerful sound system (including a powerful bass response to simulate the feeling of the reactor core) hooked up to an industry standard mixing board which combines input from a combination of sound sources heard through the main speakers, such as, sound effects, music, DVD players, CD players, microphones, and voice distorters. The video system is just as complex. Each mission available has a story DVD with clips compiled for scenes in a story and other visual effects. These video sources are all controlled by a video switcher so that it appears to be a seamless video. In addition to movie clips, the Space Center also makes its own tactical screens. Tactical screens are in essence complex power points that can be networked to display real time information about the ship. This information may include information about things related to the current story such as ship systems while others may be maps or other mission information. Various programs have been used to create these screens including HyperCard and Runtime Revolution. Each simulator is also equipped with a lighting system allowing both red and white lights to be displayed; red during alerts and white during normal alert levels. Each set of lights is attached to a dimmer in the control room allowing the lights to manually fluctuate in different events during a mission, such as a torpedo impact or power failure. The most advanced set of lights at the Space Center is installed in the Galileo. The lighting system in the Galileo is capable of being controlled via computer making effects seem more realistic. In order to ensure that campers are safe, a network of closed circuit cameras is also installed at key points on the set to monitor their positions. Each simulator has part of the bridge and connected areas of the set monitored at all times. The most complex part of each simulator is the computer systems. Each ship has several computers installed. The smallest set, the Galileo, has five, while the largest set, the Magellan, has 16. Each one of these computers (excluding sound effect computers and tactical [main viewer] computers) is connected to a network allowing communication between computers. In this way, the programs on each of the computers are also able to communicate with each other, allowing the control room to monitor the simulation and for computers on the bridge to update each other with information sent from the control room. The programming on each of the computers used to be programmed in HyperCard, which was in use on the USS Voyager until the simulator was decommissioned. Later however, the Space Center switched to Revolution by Runtime Revolution. The next generation of programs at the Space Center were programmed in Cocoa, Apple Inc's own programming language for their Macintosh computer platform. Since 2018, the space center has used the Thorium open-source starship simulator platform, developed by a former volunteer. Private donations paid for the simulators, while the school district pays the salary of the center's director. 181 volunteers and part-timers help to operate the simulators. Staff The Space Center's full-time employee are the Director, Flight Directors, and Bridge Supervisors. The volunteering organization is divided into guilds and classes of volunteers as follows: *The Flight Directors --- (Dark Blue Collared Shirts) The Flight Directors (FD's) \\"run\\" the mission, --- giving cues to the actors, telling the staff when to do certain things, assigning roles, etc. The FD also is the voice of the Main Computer and the Main Engineer (whom the crew cannot see), giving them hints and tips along the way. Besides the center's director, they have the most authority, along with the Set Directors. *The Set Directors --- There are four Set Directors (One for each of the simulators). The Set Directors pretty much \\"own\\" the simulators that they are Set Director of. They are usually the main FD for that ship. *The Supervisors --- (Bright Blue Collared Shirts) The Supervisors supervise the mission. They are the FD's right-hand men and women. They relay orders, help get the story moving, etc. They are second in command, but are only used on missions in Magellan, and previously in the Voyager. They usually are sometimes also FDs. *The Volunteers --- (Black T-shirts) The Volunteers are the arms and legs of the Flight Directors. They can be assigned by the Flight Director to be the ship's doctor character, be an alien actor, be Second Chair (The Second Chair switches the lights on and off, respond to sensor scans, change what is showing on the viewscreen, send messages, etc.), or pretty much anything else the FD wants them to do. =The Guilds= (Note: All of the classes of Volunteers above except for the regular Volunteers have their own guild ((e.g. The Flight Director's Guild))) *The Programming Guild --- The Programming Guild (Light Blue Collared Shirts) programs the ship's controls and all they other computer programs used at the Space Center. (See above) *The Maintenance Guild --- The Maintenance Guild creates the simulators, does repairs, installs new features, and pretty much holds the simulators together. *The Acting Guild --- The Acting Guild is a special set of volunteers that are trained in the \\"prestigious\\" art of acting at the Space Center. Programs and Camps The Space Center offers a variety of programs that provide varying mission lengths and experiences. Continuing the educational aim of the Space Center, there are programs for school classes that provide education about science, space and teamwork/leadership. These programs also offer educational experience missions on the simulators. For the general public, there are also private missions, overnight camps, \\"Super Saturdays\\" and summer camps. Private missions are available to be reserved in 2 lengths: 2.5 hour and 5 hour missions. These time blocks include time for briefing and training in preparation for the actual mission on the simulator. Overnight camps used to start on Friday nights and end on the following morning: all missions are 'paused' for the night, campers sleep at the Space Center overnight, and then missions are resumed in the morning. These missions however, are no longer available. Super Saturday camps provide the same missions as overnight camps, but occur during the day on Saturdays. These camps are only offered from August to May. The Leadership Camp is made for an older audience of ages 15–17. It differs from the other summer camps in the way that the whole camp is a campaign and every mission is part of a bigger picture. Summer camps usually happen over 3 days with campers returning home to sleep. These are the longest available camps.

The park is the site of the Kamehameha V Cottage which used to be the home of Prince Lot Kapuāiwa, who would later become King Kamehameha V. It is also the site of the annual Prince Lot Hula Festival, and the home of a large monkeypod tree that is known in Japan as the Hitachi tree. The Kamehameha V cottage, later used by Samuel Mills Damon The gardens The gardens are located just off Interstate H-201 in the Moanalua district near Tripler Army Medical Center at . Once owned and operated by the estate of local businessman and landowner Samuel Mills Damon (1841–1924), the garden was bought by Kaimana Ventures, whose president John Philip Damon is a great-grandson of Samuel Damon. =Kamehameha V Cottage= The Kamehameha V Cottage, located at the western end of the garden, was originally built in the 1850s by Prince Lot Kapuāiwa, who would later become King Kamehameha V. The three separate units of the cottage (a kitchen and dining room unit, a living room/bedroom unit, and an entertainment unit) are connected via a series of roofed porches. Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop willed the cottage, along with the rest of the ahupuaa (traditional land division) of Moanalua to Damon when she died in 1884. Damon renovated the cottage and used it as a residence. The cottage was moved to its present location in 1960; it had been in three different locations in Moanalua before then. =Hitachi tree= The Hitachi tree The Hitachi tree, a large monkeypod tree with a distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy, grows in the middle of a grassy area in the middle of the park. The tree is registered as an exceptional tree by the City and County of Honolulu and cannot be removed or destroyed without city council approval. Japanese electronics manufacturer Hitachi, Ltd. has used the tree as a corporate symbol since 1973. An agreement between the Damon Estate and Hitachi gave Hitachi exclusive worldwide rights to use the tree's image for promotional purposes in exchange for annual payments of US$20,000. The status of the agreement was called into question when the Damon Estate was dissolved after the last remaining grandchild died in 2004. Hitachi negotiated with the new owner and reached an agreement with Kaimana Ventures in December 2006 where Hitachi would pay US$400,000 annually for promotional rights until 2016. The revenue from Hitachi is expected to only partially defray the US$600,000 annual expenses for the park.

It was announced by Canon in 1994, and was the professional model in the range, superseding the original EOS-1. The camera was itself superseded by the EOS-1v in 2000. The original EOS-1 had been launched in 1989, two years after the company had introduced their new EOS autofocus system. It was the company's first professional-level EOS camera and was aimed at the same photographers who had used Canon's highly regarded, manual focus professional FD mount SLRs, such as the Canon New F-1 and the Canon T90.Canon EOS-1N Series AF SLR camera On a physical level the EOS-1 resembled the T90, which had been designed for Canon by Luigi Colani. The EOS-1N was a revision of the EOS-1, with five autofocus points spread across the frame rather than a single centrally-mounted autofocus point, plus more effective weather sealing, a wider exposure range, and numerous other improvements.Photonotes : EOS 1, EOS 1N, 3 and 1V In common with the EOS-1, the 1N used Canon's A-TTL automatic flash system, and does not support the more modern E-TTL. Features At the time of its creation, The Canon EOS-1N was placed at the top of Canon's EOS camera line. The camera featured polycarbonate external construction with weather-resistant seals around buttons, dials and its Canon EF lens mount. The fixed eye-level pentaprism viewfinder has 100-percent vertical and horizontal coverage, has dioptric viewfinder adjustment from –3 to +1 diopter and has as a viewfinder eyepiece blind to block stray light when on a tripod. For automatic focusing, the camera used a 5-point BASIS auto focus system with the sensors arranged horizontally across the middle of the viewing area. The center point is a cross-type, which detects horizontal and vertical lines, while the outer four detect vertical lines only. Metering modes include a 16-zone evaluative, center-weighted average, partial, selectable spot, and fine central spot metering mode. Film speeds can be set from ISO 6-6400 either manually or automatically by DX codes on the film canisters. The camera allows variable Program autoexposure, as well as aperture-priority and shutter- priority automatic exposure and manual exposure. Another option is Depth-of- field AE (DEP), an automatic mode that selects the focusing distance and aperture f-number to place the depth of field between two user-specified near and far points. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 of a second in all exposure modes. A non-timed bulb speed is available. Flash X-sync is available up to a shutter speed of 1/250 of a second. There are 14 custom functions to change the way the camera operates, which set options like exposure steps and mirror lock-up. The camera has user-interchangeable focusing screens, interchangeable with those out of other EOS-1-series cameras, and a now-discontinued interchangeable Canon Command Back E1. Power comes from one 2CR5 battery, an optional BP-E1 Battery Pack housing four AA alkaline or lithium batteries or the PB-E1 Power Booster drive housing eight AA batteries and allowing for 6 frames per second to be photographed, depending on the type of battery and the shutter speed selected. The camera weighs in at 855 grams, or 1 lb and 14.15 oz. Background There were several versions of the EOS-1N available. The base model EOS-1N consisted of the standard camera body with significant upgrades over the EOS 1, launched in 1989. The EOS-1N DP comprised the standard body and the BP-E1 pack (see below) and the EOS-1N HS comprised the standard body plus booster (see below). One feature the EOS-1N (and previous/subsequent '1' models) lacks, which lower models in the range have, is built-in flash, intentionally omitted to provide an overall very rigid camera body able to withstand severe treatment by professionals. Weather sealing was incorporated after feedback from working professionals. Other notable omissions are the eye-controlled focus feature of the EOS 5 and the bar code reader of the EOS 10, neither of which are professional-level cameras. Another feature of the EOS-1N, and other professional models in the range, is the provision for a precise viewfinder indication of exposure in manual mode. This had previously been provided in fully manual cameras such as the F-1, but older Canon cameras with automatic exposure modes merely provided a recommended exposure reading in manual mode, leaving the user to accept the offered settings or not. The EOS-1N provides a viewfinder readout similar to the old F-1's needle display, but in electronic LCD form showing steps in 0.3, 0.5 or 1 stops. Like the EOS 5, the internal displays of the EOS 1N self-adjust in brightness in response to the brightness level of the subject. The optional Power Booster PB-E1 or Battery Pack BP-E1 attach to the base of the camera. The booster (PB-E1) holds 8 AA batteries or an optional Ni-Cad pack, and boosts the standard drive from 3 frames per second to 6(AI Servo AF: 5). The Power Booster E1 has its own shutter release and input dial for use when shooting in the vertical format. The battery pack (BP-E1) is a lighter and simpler accessory. This holds 4 AA cells and a lithium battery, and the user can select between the two power sources with a switch. It provides a grip for vertical shots but no additional controls. The major appeal of the Battery Pack BP-E1 is that is lighter and less expensive than the power booster. There is also a PB-E2 (has AF-field-button, a wheel around the shutter-button). ATT: Statement about input dial on PB-E1 is wrong. PB-E1 has 2 buttons (shutter button, AE-lock) and vertical control switch (on/oFF) and nothing else. Input Dial is then only on PB-E2!Also called Power Drive Booster PDB. AA-Lithium -Batteries only if AE-Lock-button has a star * imprinted. In addition to the standard EOS-1N there was another, specialised model in the range — the EOS-1N RS, introduced in 1995, with a permanently attached power drive booster. This camera has a fixed pellicle mirror so there is no viewfinder black-out at the moment of exposure. The fixed mirror allows high-speed continuous shooting at a top speed of 10 frames per second, with a shutter release lag as low as 6 ms. There is a cost to this however: slightly less light reaches the film, as some is always being directed up to the viewfinder and optical quality loss. By the time of the release of the next generation EOS 1V, considerable technical improvements to the standard camera design meant that Canon no longer offered RS model variants. The EOS 1N was discontinued in 2001 with the arrival of the EOS 1V. Digital A Kodak DCS 560, part of the second generation of digital SLRs derived from the EOS-1N During the late 1990s, Canon and Kodak collaborated on a range of professional digital SLRs which combined Canon EOS-1N bodies with Kodak digital sensors and electronics. They were Canon's first ventures into the digital SLR marketplace and divided into two distinct generations. The first generation was the Kodak EOS DCS series of 1995, which encompassed the 6 mp EOS DCS 1, the 1.5 mp DCS 3, and the 1.3 mp DCS 5. The EOS 1N camera bodies were almost unmodified from stock configuration, and were mounted on a removable Kodak digital back.Photography in Malaysia: Part III - DCS-1, 3 , 5 Series The relationship continued with the Kodak DCS 500 series, which fully integrated the EOS-1N body with Kodak's imaging components. The range consisted of the 2 mp DCS 520 and the 6 mp DCS 560. The two cameras were also sold by Canon, as the Canon EOS D2000 and D6000 respectively.Photography in Malaysia:DCS-500 Series with Canon EOS-1n body Chassis Canon's subsequent professional digital SLRs were produced independently of Kodak, and were initially based on the Canon EOS-1V, before moving to custom-designed digital bodies.

To accomplish this, the software maps complex musical concepts to intuitive visual representations. Color, shape, and texture are used to convey high-level musical features such as timbre, melodic contour, and harmonic tension. Hyperscore has received international media attention and awards. It has been featured in numerous news and journal publications, including the New York Times,Matthew Mirapaul, \\"From a Few Colored Lines Come the Sounds of Music,\\" New York Times May 27, 2002. as well as television programs such as Scientific American Frontiers. Composing Users of Hyperscore compose music by first creating simple melodies or sequences of notes. A library of predefined elements is also provided. These melodies are assigned unique colors. The user then creates a musical sketch composed of colored lines, where each line instances the notes from the corresponding melody. The contour and position of the line alters the pitch at which notes are played back. The software can optionally use different classes of automated harmonization to organize the given notes, in order to easily generate more pleasing results. The effects of the harmony algorithms can be controlled by contours in a special line presented throughout the sketch. Modulations and sections of harmonic tension and resolution can be introduced in this manner, adding interest and variation to the music. Hyperscore also provides users with control over tempo and dynamics. MIDI synthesis is used for audible output from within the application and all General MIDI voices are available for use. History Hyperscore was developed by Morwaread Farbood in Tod Machover's Opera of the Future group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab. Early versions of the software allowed users to generate novel compositions from predefined motives by sketching lines indicating patterns of musical tension. The application evolved to play a prominent role in the Toy Symphony. During an international tour of this project, children were given the opportunity to compose orchestral pieces using Hyperscore, which were then performed in concert along with other works utilizing traditional and technologically enhanced instruments and approaches. Current applications Hyperscore has since become a commercial product and is currently maintained and developed by Harmony Line, Inc. The software continues to serve a pedagogical role in music education. It has also become a key component of the H-Lounge, an online music and ring tone-oriented social networking community. H-lounge.com is a website dedicated to music makers who can upload mp3's or songs they have created with Hyperscore. However, Hyperscore is no longer free and has a download charge of $79.

The original music score was composed by James Horner based on a song composed by Loreena McKennitt. The film was marketed with the tagline \\"Some fantasies go too far.\\" Plot San Francisco Assistant District Attorney David Corelli (Caruso) is called to the murder scene of prominent businessman Kyle Medford, found bludgeoned to death in his home by an antique hatchet. Police detectives Bob Hargrove and Petey Vesko find photographs in Medford's safe of Governor Lew Edwards (Crenna) having sex with a prostitute, later identified as Patrice Jacinto. During questioning, Patrice reveals that other women and she were paid by Medford to have sex with wealthy men at his beach house in Pacifica. She also informs them that the most desired prostitute among the clients was a woman known only as \\"Jade\\". In a private meeting with Governor Edwards and aide Bill Barrett, Corelli is warned not to make the photographs public. Corelli is then almost killed when his brake line is deliberately cut and his vehicle goes out of control while driving down a steep hill. The detectives find fingerprints on the hatchet belonging to Katrina Gavin, a clinical psychologist and former lover of Corelli's who eventually married his close friend, defense attorney Matt Gavin. When interviewed, Katrina explains that Medford gave her a tour of his antique collection on the day in question, but claims to have nothing to do with his death. At Medford's beach house, Corelli and the detectives find various drugs, alcohol, and sex toys, as well as hidden video cameras. They conclude Medford was recording the sex sessions to blackmail the men. Corelli is shocked to discover Katrina on one of the tapes; the revelation renews the detectives' interest in her as a suspect. Patrice arranges to meet Corelli at a restaurant to discuss Jade's identity, but she is murdered in a hit-and-run attack by an unknown assailant driving a black 1993 Ford Thunderbird. Corelli, witnessing the murder first-hand, chases the assailants' vehicle in vain. The detectives discover the Gavins own a similar Thunderbird, so suspect Katrina of killing Patrice, but when they find the actual vehicle used in the hit-and-run abandoned, someone appears to be trying to frame Katrina. Katrina is again brought in for questioning and this time is shown the sex tape. Matt, in his capacity as her attorney, ends the interrogation before she fully explains her involvement. When confronted at their home, Katrina admits to her husband that she did have sex with the man on the tape, due in part to her knowledge of Matt's many affairs. Katrina visits Corelli at his apartment and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him. She admits having felt sexually liberated by sleeping with several men at the beach house. Meanwhile, the only witness to identify Katrina at the Pacifica beach house, a man named Henderson, is found murdered. Corelli informs the detectives at the crime scene that Katrina could not have killed him because Corelli and she were together at the time. Back at his apartment, Corelli is met by Matt, who holds him at gunpoint and angrily accuses him of having sex with Katrina. He denies it and persuades Matt that his wife's life is in danger. They hurry to the Gavin home, where Det. Hargrove, Pat Callendar and governor's aide Barrett have come to kill Katrina and search for the incriminating photos of the governor. Callendar is shot by Matt, but Barrett manages to escape. At the mean time, Hargrove is trying to rape and kill Katrina, but Corelli and Matt arrive and Hargrove is shot by Matt. Corelli goes to the governor for a guarantee of Katrina's safety by leveraging his possession of the photographs. The governor denies any knowledge of Hargrove or Callendar's actions, but insinuates they were both acting on his behalf. As she gets ready for bed at home, Katrina finds photographs laid out in her bathroom of her having sex at the beach house. Matt admits to Katrina that he killed Medford, certain that Medford eventually would blackmail them both. He then tells Katrina to \\"introduce me to Jade\\" the next time they \\"make love\\".

After his sudden departure from NYPD Blue, David Caruso was hoping to break through with a film career and accepted the role. The part of Matt Gavin was offered to Kenneth Branagh, before Chazz Palminteri was eventually cast. Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone were considered to play Katrina Gavin, but both rejected it. Linda Fiorentino was then asked, but she originally turned it down because she did not want to play a prostitute, but changed her mind once her character was changed through rewrites. According to Joe Eszterhas' autobiography, Hollywood Animal, William Friedkin changed the script so much that Eszterhas threatened to remove his name from the credits. He claimed Paramount settled by giving him a \\"blind script deal\\" worth $2–4 million. In an interview in Linda Ruth Williams' book The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema, Friedkin admitted that he had virtually rewritten the script. Friedkin also said that Jade was the favorite of all the films he had made. He later wrote the movie had \\"a terrific cast. A wonderful script. Great locations. How could it miss?\\"Friedkin p 413 Release A year prior to the film's release, Caruso decided that his popularity as star of the hit ABC TV series NYPD Blue would provide enough momentum to successfully make the risky jump from television to feature-film leading man. Although he did play an assistant district attorney, this film was a departure from his more heroic role on TV. Despite a large marketing campaign, moviegoers did not seem to accept Caruso in this character, or the dark and overtly sexual themes of the film. Comeback roles in television failed until he landed the lead role in CBS' 2002 spin-off series, CSI: Miami. Reception The film, with an estimated production budget of $50 million, earned $9,851,610 at the North American domestic box office, taking in $4,284,246 in its opening weekend and ranking number five in the box-office charts.Jade (1995). Box Office Mojo (1995-11-07). Retrieved on 2014-05-22. The film received negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 29 reviews and gave the film an approval score of 14%, with an average rating of 4.04/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"An ostensible erotic thriller that's largely neither erotic nor thrilling, Jade marks one of several unfortunate low points for aggressively sexual mid-'90s cinema\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Gene Siskel singled the film out as the worst one he saw in 1995. It earned two Golden Raspberry Award nominations, for Worst Screenplay and Worst New Star (for Caruso, who was nominated for both Jade and Kiss of Death), but lost both categories to Showgirls, also written by Joe Eszterhas. Friedkin admitted the film was \\"a critical and financial disaster\\", although it \\"contained some of my best work. I felt I had let down the actors, the studio, and most of all, Sherry (Sherry Lansing, his wife, an executive at Paramount). I went into a deep funk. Was it the Exorcist curse, as many have suggested, a poor choice of material, or simply that whatever talent I had was ephemeral? Maybe all of the above.\\"Friedkin p 414 Michael Biehn was not fond of the film: \\"Well, on Jade, I had no idea what I was doing. I don’t think anybody had any idea what they were doing. It was a Joe Eszterhas script. To me, none of it ever really made any sense. I didn’t realize until the read-through that I was the bad guy in it. It was like a jumbled mess. And the movie came out a mess, too. It had great people on it, though. It had William Friedkin directing, it had Chazz Palmenteri, who was nominated that year for an Academy Award, it had Linda Fiorentino, who had just come out with that famous movie she did The Last Seduction, and it had David Caruso, who's a brilliant actor when given the right material, and a very smart guy. So a great cast, great director… everything but a script.\\"https://film.avclub.com/michael-biehn-on-the-victim- william-friedkin-and-his-1798233922 Director's cut An unrated \\"director's cut\\" version featuring additional scenes and more explicit sexual footage with an additional 12 minutes was later released to VHS, though it is now out of print; the theatrical cut was used for the subsequent DVD and Blu-ray editions. The planned unrated versions for DVD, LaserDisc, and Blu-ray were cancelled, due to poor sales of the unrated VHS version. The unrated version was available on the streaming service Hulu in 2010. In one alternate version of Jade, rather than having Gavin get away with murder, Corelli returns to the house, clearly planning to place him under arrest. Cable channels USA, Cinemax, and WGN air the director's cut, including some scenes originally cut to avoid a possible NC-17 rating and for length.

Life =Birth= In the biography of the saint in the Acta Sanctorum which was preserved at the Abbey of Fécamp in NormandyAfter the Norman Conquest this abbey had acquired Cuthmann's church at Steyning – by then dedicated to him – turning it into a minster church, administered by a college of secular canons, and taking his relics to Fécamp. This college was dissolved in 1260 and the church was rebuilt, rededicated to St Andrew and became a standard parish church, with vicars appointed by the Abbey. it is said that he was born about 681, either in Devon or Cornwall, or more probably at Chidham, near Bosham, about 25 miles from Steyning.This would make his journey from his birthplace to Steyning of a more rational length. A birth in Chidham at that date would place him in the right time and area to be preached to by Saint Wilfrid, the Apostle of Sussex (680–685), and would probably make Wilfrid the man who converted and baptised Cuthmann and his parents.Some authorities give him a date later than this. =Travels to Steyning= His legend states he was a shepherd who had to care for his paralysed mother after his father's death. When they fell on hard times and were forced to beg from door to door, he built a one-wheeled cart or wheelbarrow (with a rope from the handles over his shoulders taking part of the weight) in which he moved her around with him. They set out east, towards the rising sun, from his home and, even though the rope broke, he improvised a new one from withies, deciding that when that rope broke he would accept it as a sign from God to stop at that place and build a church.Some haymakers who were watching laughed at him, but a heavy rainstorm ruined their hay and taught them a lesson. Later versions of the story say that, from that moment onwards, it always rained in that particular field during the haymaking season. The withy rope broke at the place now called Steyning, upon which (according to his biography) he prayed: :\\"Father Almighty, you have brought my wanderings to an end; now enable me to begin this work. For who am I, Lord, that I should build a house to name? If I rely on myself, it will be of no avail, but it is you who will assist me. You have given me the desire to be a builder; make up for my lack of skill, and bring the work of building this holy house to its completion.\\" After building a hut to accommodate his mother and himself, he began work on the church (now St Andrew's, Steyning, which in the 20th century instituted a Cuthmann chapel in his honour), with help from the locals. As the church was nearing completion and Cuthmann was having difficulty with a roof-beam, a stranger showed him how to fix it. When Cuthmann asked his name, he replied: :\\"I am he in whose name you are building this church.\\"i.e. Christ, who had been a carpenter before his ministry Whatever date is ascribed to Cuthmann, this church was in existence by 857, when King Æthelwulf of Wessex, the father of Alfred the Great, was buried there. =Other legends= According to one legend, Chanctonbury Ring near Steyning was created by the Devil who became so angry at the conversion of England thanks to 'apostles' like Cuthmann that he decided to dig a channel by night to let in the sea and drown the Christians of Sussex. Fortunately, Cuthmann found out the Devil’s plan and tricked him by holding a candle behind a sieve and knocking the local cock off its perch. When the Devil saw the light and heard the cock crow, he fled the scene, leaving his great plan unfinished and giving us a complex of hills (the mounds of earth from his digging), including Chanctonbury Ring and the nearby ‘Devil's Dyke.’ According to another, whilst he was a shepherd, one day he drew a line around his sheep with his staff so that he could get away to collect food. On his return, he found that the flock had not left the invisible boundary. This miracle may have taken place in a field near Chidham, which for centuries was known as ‘St Cuthman’s Field’ or ‘St Cuthman’s Dell.’ It was said that a large stone in the field, ‘on which the holy shepherd was in the habit of sitting,’ held miraculous properties. Veneration Cuthmann was venerated as a saint in the Steyning area before the Norman Conquest. In charters of William the Conqueror, Steyning is sometimes called \\"St Cuthman's Port\\" or \\"St Cuthman's Parish\\". The translation of his relics to Fécamp led to his becoming well known on the continent and even to his feast being celebrated at many of the religious houses of Normandy. This can be seen most clearly in a German engraving of him with his \\"cart\\" by Martin Schongauer, and the inclusion, transcription (from an anonymous source) and printing of his Life in the saints' lives collected in 1658 in the Bollandist Acta Sanctorum, giving his feast day as 8 February. There is also a choir seat carving at Ripon Cathedral dating from a few decades after 1450 (with him and a three-wheeled wheelbarrow) and at his birthplace of Chidham there was a Guild of St Cuthman, subject to a tax in 1522 under Henry VIII. Though the church he founded at Steyning was later re-dedicated to Andrew not Cuthmann, moves began in January 2007 within the parish to have it rededicated to \\"St Andrew and St Cuthman\\", giving the apostle Andrew precedence but reincluding Cuthmann – these moves succeeded and the church is now dedicated to \\"St Andrew and St Cuthman\\". The church also has a Cuthmann chapel and a statue of him outside by artist Penny Reeve, while a picture of him with his wheelbarrow also continues to be Steyning's logo on its town sign.

Before his NFL career, he played for University of Wisconsin–Madison and was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 1987 NFL Draft. Odomes was one of the top defensive backs in the NFL during the early 1990s, assisting the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and making the Pro Bowl twice (1992 and 1993). One of his more memorable plays was in a 1992 playoff game known as The Comeback, where he intercepted a pass from future Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon to set up Buffalo's game-winning field goal. In the following season, Odomes led the NFL with 9 interceptions, and made a key interception in the second quarter of Super Bowl XXVIII to help his team build a 13–6 halftime lead. However, his team still lost the game 30–13. After the 1993 season, Odomes signed with Seattle and spent two injury-plagued years with the Seahawks. He never suited up for Seattle.

The film is about three suburban 11-year-old boys who find themselves behind in \\"the battle of the sexes,\\" believing they would regain the upper hand if they could just see a real, live naked lady. Shot in various locations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cincinnati and Lebanon, Ohio, the story is set in an Ohio suburb named \\"Middleton\\", outside of an unnamed city (for which Pittsburgh was used). The screenplay sold to Paramount Pictures by John Mattson in 1992 for $1.1 million, a record for a romantic comedy spec script. The film was originally set up with Joe Dante to direct and his frequent partner, Michael Finnell, to produce, but they left the project over disputes regarding the budget and their fees. Plot Three junior high school boys—Brad (Adam LaVorgna), Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and Kevin (Brian Christopher)—travel from their bedroom suburb of Middletown to the city, bringing money with hopes of seeing a woman naked. They find a hooker named V (Melanie Griffith) who is willing to show her breasts. However, when they decide to head home, they find their bikes have been stolen, leaving them broke and stuck in the city. V speaks with her friend, Cash (Casey Siemaszko), and another hooker, Betty (Anne Heche). Cash has been skimming money that he sends to mob boss Waltzer (Malcolm McDowell), who in turn steals from his own boss, Jerry (Philip Bosco). V notices the boys outside in the rain and offers them a ride back home in Cash's car. After they arrive at Frank's house, V's car suddenly breaks down so she goes inside to use the phone. Tom (Ed Harris), Frank's father, comes home and is surprised to find a woman in the house. Unbeknownst to V, Frank tells Tom that V is a math tutor and that she's giving lessons to Brad. Tom offers to repair her car in a few days when he is free from his science classes at school. With no other option, she accepts Frank's offer to stay in his tree house without Tom's knowledge. Frank begins a close friendship with V, hoping to set her up with his father. He tells her Tom has no problem with her \\"job,\\" meaning the tutoring ruse, but she thinks he means her prostitution. V learns from television that Cash has been murdered by Waltzer. She phones Betty only to discover that Waltzer is looking for her - Cash told him that she stole the money. She realizes that he is overhearing the conversation and hangs up. With V's car still broken down, she gets Tom's old bike from the garage and rushes to find him. He is on a field trip to the town's wetlands, undeveloped natural land that he is attempting to save from development. He is unable to repair her car any sooner, but she realizes that she is probably safer in Middleton, since Waltzer doesn't know where she is. At school, Frank flunks a biology test about sex education and must give his class an oral presentation. He decides to use V as a mannequin and through a ruse distracts his teacher long enough to draw a relatively accurate female reproductive system on her skin-colored bodysuit. Tom and V go out on a date and both realize they are developing feelings for each other. While walking through town on their date, Tom and V run into Kevin's family. V recognizes Kevin's father, who is a client, but he initially says she has him mixed up with someone else before admitting to remembering her and says she was a dance teacher. Tom is impressed with how busy V is being a tutor and dance teacher; V then realizes that Frank had actually lied about Tom knowing about her prostitution. V explains herself to Tom, and their relationship grows. She reveals that her real name is Eve, which she thought was too biblical so she removed the “e”s. Kevin's father unwittingly calls her home phone number, which he had in his pocket notebook, in an attempt to purchase her services again. He talks to Betty and Waltzer, who happens to be there also, learns from Betty about the trip to Middleton, thus finding out where V is hiding. V is terrified that Waltzer will find her so she decides to leave town but attends a school dance to say goodbye to Frank. Waltzer shows up to spoil their fun. A chase ensues, with Waltzer finally being eliminated. Anxious about her status and afraid to return to her old job, V goes to Waltzer's boss and relates how he has been cheating him. She asks to be \\"forgotten\\" by them. The older crime boss succumbs to her charms and he tells her he'll take care of things and that she doesn't need to be afraid anymore, while also allowing her to walk away from prostitution for good. V finds the stolen money in a backpack and uses it to buy the wetlands in Tom's name; it is also revealed that she purchased the ice cream parlor in town, so she can carry on with her new relationship.

Originally intended to be a class of two ships specifically designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), only Vittorio Veneto entered into service in 1969, its sister ship Italia being cancelled. Vittorio Veneto was decommissioned in 2003. This ship has the same general layout as the smaller helicopter cruisers, but with two elevators in the flight deck and the hangar below, rather than with the hangar as part of the superstructure. It was named for the decisive Battle of Vittorio Veneto which ended World War I on the Italian front. History Though the Andrea Doria-class helicopter cruisers proved a useful addition to the fleet, it was judged that a larger ship was necessary. Such a vessel would be able operate a larger airwing and provide helicopter support in bad weather conditions. These considerations led to the Vittorio Veneto class, of which two ships were originally planned, though only one was actually built. The second ship of the class, Italia, was cancelled. The ship was laid down on 10 June 1965 and launched on 5 February 1967.Gardiner & Chumbly, p.205 The cruiser was completed on 12 July 1969 at the Italcantieri plant of Castellammare di Stabia. It entered in service in the October of the same year, at the naval base of Taranto. Vittorio Veneto remained the flagship of the Italian Navy until the aircraft carrier was commissioned in 1985. Design Vittorio Veneto has a displacement of 7,500 tons standard and 8,850 tons fully loaded. Unlike the Andrea Dorias, which had separate funnels, it has two combination mast/funnels. The second major difference in design is the location of the helicopter facilities. Vittorio Veneto has a raised rear deck to accommodate a hangar beneath the helicopter platform, rather than a frigate/destroyer style hangar in the superstructure. There are two elevators to transfer the helicopters between the hangar and the deck. Originally the ship carried armament similar to the Andrea Dorias comprising a Terrier anti-aircraft system situated in front of the bridge, which could also be used to launch ASROC antisubmarine rockets. Compared to the Andrea Dorias, Vittorio Venetos missile magazine has a third drum, increasing magazine capacity by a half to sixty rounds The secondary armament comprised eight dual-purpose guns in a ring around the superstructure, similar to the Andrea Dorias. Finally, the vessel was armed with two triple 324 mm torpedo launchers. Vittorio Veneto could operate up to nine light helicopters, of the types Agusta-Bell AB-204 or later AB-212 or six heavy helicopters of the type AB-61, which could be housed in the hangar beneath the long rear deck. The electronics were rather advanced for the time, comprising a three- dimensional AN/SPS-52 B radar and an SPS-768 (RAN 3L) air search radar. For anti-submarine warfare an AN/SQS-23 sonar set was installed. Vittorio Veneto was propelled by two steam turbines providing , for a maximum speed of . Like the previous class, the cruiser had a set of stabilizing fins to improve stability for helicopter operations. Upgrades The ship underwent an extensive update between 1981 and 1984. The electronics were updated, and launchers for Otomat missiles were installed, together with three OTO Melara twin DARDO CIWS compact gun mounts for AA defence and Standard SM-1ER SAM missiles to replace the Terrier SAM. The engine feeding system was shifted from nafta to diesel fuel for standardisation and environmental reasons. Accidents Vittorio Veneto ran aground in bad weather off the port of Vlorë on 22 April 1997. At the time she was acting as the flagship of a multinational task-force that protected aid deliveries to Albania. It took four tugboats to pull her free. No damage to the ship or injuries to the crew were reported by the Italian navy. Decommissioning After 1995 Vittorio Veneto served mainly as a training ship. She was decommissioned in 2003. At the time, she was the second to last cruiser in service with any Western European fleet, leaving only the , which remained in service until 2010. Her air coverage capability is now supplied by the V/STOL aircraft carrier . See also  * References Sources * Gardiner, Robert; Chumbley, Stephen & Budzbon, Przemysław (1995).

In 1956 WDR broadcaster established the first shortwave transmitter near Mersch, and in subsequent years this site was expanded. On 1 September 1961 this site was handed over to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Federal Post) to establish the German foreign broadcasting service, \\"Deutsche Welle\\". In time 10 transmitters of 100 kilowatts were installed. These were transmitting antennas with enormous dipole arrays between free-standing steel framework towers which were installed. Today these transmitters are rented predominantly to non-German broadcasting organisations. In the 1990s a mediumwave transmitter was installed on the site, using a long wire antenna which is spun at a tower on the transmitter site. It was intended to be used for transmission of the programmes of \\"Radio Viva\\" on 702 kHz, but it never went into regular service for this broadcaster. Since 6 December 2004, the mediumwave transmitter has been used to broadcast the programme of the German commercial broadcaster \\"TruckRadio\\" on 702 kHz. In 2006, the British multi-millionaire Bob Edmiston from West Bromwich, acquired the entire transmitter. The car dealer and founder of the Christian missionary vision is regarded as creationist and had, amongst other things, bought a radio transmitter in Darwin, Australia 6 years ago. In January 2008 the broadcasting facility was sold by T-Systems to the religious broadcaster CVC / Christian Vision.

It has also been released on DVD as a film series. The show is based on the Spawn character from Image Comics, and won an Emmy in 1999 for Outstanding Animation Program (longer than one hour). Plot The series centered around the story of an ex-Marine Lieutenant Colonel named Al Simmons, who fought as a commando and government assassin in covert black ops. He was betrayed and killed by a man whom he believed to be his close friend (the man, later to be revealed as Chapel, burned him alive with a flamethrower during a mission). Upon his death, Simmons vowed revenge on Chapel and hoped that he would one day return to his beloved wife Wanda. Because of his life as an assassin, Simmons' soul goes to Hell. In order to accomplish his vow, he makes a pact with the devil Malebolgia (who was the overlord on the eighth plane of Hell). The pact was a simple one: Simmons would become a soldier in Malebolgia's army (known as a \\"Hellspawn\\" or \\"Spawn\\" for short) in return for the ability to walk the earth once again in order to see Wanda. However, Simmons was tricked by Malebolgia: his body was not returned to him and he is returned to Earth five years after his death. He had been given a different body which was a festering, pungently cadaverous, maggot-ridden walking corpse that had a massive living red cape attached to it. Because his new body had been rotten for some time and was in an advanced state of decay, his face had become heavily malformed, to the point that he barely appeared human, which led to Simmons donning a mask in order to cover its grotesque appearance. Upon his return to \\"life\\", Spawn seeks out Wanda, who had apparently got over the grief of having lost Al and married another man, Al's best friend Terry Fitzgerald with whom she seemingly had a daughter, Cyan. Terry, a respectable man, works as an analyst for a man named Jason Wynn. Wynn is a powerbroker in the CIA and secretly a black-market arms dealer, amongst other things (such as the head of secret government organizations within the NSA and National Security Council ). Wynn is revealed to be the man responsible for the death of Al Simmons due to a disagreement that the two had between each other concerning their \\"work.\\" Jason's actions would also prove dangerous to the lives of Terry, Wanda and their daughter as well. Realizing that he is no longer the man in Wanda's life, Al swears to protect her and her new family. The series depicts Spawn nesting in the dark alleyways, killing any who invade his new-found territory. Rejecting these actions as unworthy of Spawn's time and power, Malebolgia then dispatches another of his minions (a demonic creature known as the Violator that assumes the form of a short, obese clown) to try to persuade Spawn to commit acts of violence and savagery in the name of Hell. Spawn struggles to fight the lure of evil, as well as seeking to escape being hunted by not only the forces of Hell, but by assailants from Heaven, who have a need to destroy the Hellspawns in order to cripple the forces of Hell so that they do not gain an edge in the escalating war between the two spiritual hosts. As the war intensifies, the line between the forces of good and evil become increasingly blurry. Spawn finds help along the way in the form of a disheveled old man named Cogliostro who was once a Hellspawn that overcame the demonic powers resting within, amongst a number of other characters. In the last episodes of the series, Spawn learns how to shapeshift and, appearing as Terry, makes love to Wanda, impregnating her. It is revealed that there is a prophecy that the child of a Hellspawn will play the deciding factor in Armageddon, and may be the real reason Spawn was allowed to return to Earth.

Variety stated in 1997 that \\"It’s as dark and complex as anything HBO has attempted in the live-action arena. And visually, it’s quite the stunner. HBO wanted different, and it surely got it.\\" A more mixed review at the time in 1997 came from The Dallas Morning News, they questioned why anyone would \\"want to subject themselves to such a relentlessly grim, gruesome dehumanizing experience.\\" =Legacy= Todd McFarlane's Spawn was ranked 5th on IGN's list of \\"The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time\\", and 23rd on IGN's list of \\"Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time\\" (despite the fact the show was aired at midnight on HBO). Series producer Eric Radomski reflected in a retrospective interview that \\"Spawn TAS was a personal triumph for me. Very rarely do artists get the opportunity to have as much uncensored creative freedom as I did at HBO on Spawn.\\"http://spawn.popgeeks.com/tas/backstage/interviews/radomski.php Music The score and opening theme was handled by Shirley Walker, who also composed background music for Batman: The Animated Series. While Batman: The Animated Series featured traditional movie orchestra-type music, the producers of Todd McFarlane's Spawn requested that Walker give the series a more organic and subtle electronic soundtrack, with only minimal usage of orchestral sounds. Home video All three seasons have been released separately on DVD and VHS as three two-hour movies, under the titles Todd McFarlane's Spawn, Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2, and Todd McFarlane's Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle after editing these seasons into movies. On July 24, 2007, HBO Video released a 4-disc 10th-anniversary signature collector's edition on DVD with all 18 episodes and multiple bonus features. When the show's first and second seasons were released on video they were released in two formats. The first format was called the \\"Uncut Collector's Edition\\", which is the version that was shown on TV and held a TV-MA rating, and the other was a special edited version called the \\"Special Edited Edition\\" which held a PG-13 rating by toning down the violence and sexual content. The first movie was also released in the UMD format for Sony's PSP handheld video game system, but the other two movies were not. On July 5, 2016, HBO added all three seasons to its streaming services, HBO GO and HBO NOW.

His shrine is at Merv, Turkmenistan. Life Born in Buzanjird near Hamadan in 1062, he moved from Hamadan to Baghdad when he was eighteen years of age. He studied the Shafi'i school of fiqh under the supervision of the master of his time, Shaykh Ibrahim ibn Ali ibn Yusuf al-Fairuzabadi. He kept association in Baghdad with the great scholar, Abu Ishaq ash-Shirazi, who gave him greater deference than to any of his other students although he was the youngest. But he adhered to the Hanafi school unlike his teachers. According to Ibn Khallikan, he began his religious career with the cultivation of the religious sciences, becoming both a respected scholar of hadith and fiqh and a popular preacher in Baghdad. He was so brilliant a jurisprudent that he became the Marja of his time for all scholars in that field. He was known in Baghdad, the center of Islamic knowledge, in Isfahan, Bukhara, Samarqand, Khwarazm, and throughout Central Asia. Later he abandoned these pursuits, adopting an intensely ascetic way of life and travelled east, first settling in Herat and later in Merv, where his tomb is still reputed to exist. He became an ascetic and engaged in constant worship and mujahada (spiritual struggle), instructed by Shaykh Abu 'Ali al- Farmadhi. He associated with Shaykh Abdullah Ghuwayni and Shaykh Hasan Simnani.

Politics Jagjit Singh grew up in Tanda in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, about 180 km from Chandigarh. He was a dentist. Chohan was first elected to the Punjab Assembly from the Tanda as a candidate of the Republican Party of India in 1967. He became Deputy Speaker when the Akali Dal-led coalition Government took office in Punjab. When Lachhman Singh Gill became Chief Minister, Chohan was made Finance Minister. In 1969, he lost the Assembly election. Activity Overseas Two years after losing the Punjab Assembly elections in 1969, Chohan moved to the United Kingdom to start his campaign for creation of Khalistan. In 1971, he went to Nankana Sahib in Pakistan to attempt to set up a Sikh government. Chohan was invited by Pakistani army dictator Yahya Khan and was proclaimed as a Sikh leader. Certain Sikh relics that were in Pakistan were handed down to him and taken to UK. The relics had helped Chohan to gather Sikh supporters and followers. He then visited the United States at the invitation of his supporters among the Sikh diaspora. On 13 October 1971, he placed an advertisement in the New York Times proclaiming an Independent Sikh state. Advertisement of Khalistan enabled him to collect millions of dollars from the Sikh diaspora. He was charged with sedition and other crimes in connection with his separatist activities in India. In later part of 1970s, Chohan was in touch with the Pakistani diplomatic mission in Pakistan with objective of encouraging Sikh youths to travel to Pakistan for pilgrimage and indoctrination for separatist propaganda. On 12 April 1980, he declared the formation of a \\"National Council of Khalistan\\", at Anandpur Sahib. He declared himself the President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General. In 1977, he returned to India.

A similar announcement was made by Balbir Singh Sandhu, in Amritsar, who released stamps and currency of Khalistan. Operating from a building termed \\"Khalistan House\\", he remained in contact with the Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who was campaigning for a Sikh theocratic homeland. Chohan also maintained contacts among various groups in Canada, the USA, and Germany. He visited Pakistan as a guest of leaders like Chaudhuri Zahoor Elahi. Chohan declared himself president of the \\"Republic of Khalistan\\", named a Cabinet, and issued symbolic Khalistan \\"passports\\", \\"postage stamps\\", and \\"Khalistan dollars\\". Embassies in Britain and other European countries were opened by Chohan. It is reported that with the assistance of a wealthy Californian supporter, a peach magnate, he opened an Ecuadorian bank account to support his operation. Operation Blue Star and later In June 1983, Bhindranwale was asked: \\"If Jagjit Singh Chohan attacks India with assistance from England, America, and Canada, whom will you help?\\" Bhindranwale hedged and did not indicate his support. On 12 June 1984, in London Chohan was interviewed by BBC. The interviewer asked: \\"Do you actually want to see the downfall of Mrs Gandhi's Government?\\" Chohan answered: \\"..within a few days you will have the news that Mrs Gandhi and her family have been beheaded. That is what Sikhs will do..\\". After this interview, the Thatcher government curtailed Chohan's activities. The British government also instructed him to confine his activities within the bounds of democracy and laws of the land. On 13 June 1984, Chohan announced a government in exile. On 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Chohan visited Punjab in 1989 and hoisted the flag of Khalistan at a gurdwara in Anandpur Sahib. Chohan's Indian passport was cancelled on 24 April 1989. India protested when he was allowed to enter USA using the canceled passport. Vancouver fundamentalists Talwinder Singh Parmar and Surjan Singh Gill were at one time aligned with Chohan. The Khalistan movement gradually lost the popular support. By the early 1990s the Sikhs' separatist campaign was crushed. Softening and return Chohan gradually softened his stance. He supported India's attempts to defuse the tension by accepting surrenders by the militants. Other organizations, mainly in UK and North America, continue to work for a Khalistan. Indian government first permitted his wife to return. He was pardoned by the Atal Bihari government, and was allowed to return to India in June 2001, after an exile of 21 years. The government decided to overlook his past activities. After his return, in an interview Chohan said he would keep the Khalistan movement alive democratically and pointed out that he has always been against violence. Khalsa Raj Party After Chohan returned to India, he started a political party in 2002 named the Khalsa Raj Party and became its president. The stated aim of the political party was to continue his campaign for Khalistan. Chohan could not attract the support from the new generation of Sikhs. The Pioneer (newspaper) stated that his party was a 'Letterhead organization'. The office of the “Khalsa Raj Party” was located in the premises of the Chohan Charitable Hospital being run by him in Tanda. On 9 March 2006, the police booked Chohan in a case of creating lawlessness and pulled down 'controversial flag' hoisted on the building. The police also sealed the office and took into possession some objectionable documents, certain flags, some pamphlets and a computer into possession. Chohan's wife disclosed that the currency notes, passports and other documents related to Khalistan were stored in England. Police claimed that Chohan was booked for creating lawlessness by making anti-national statements on Khalistan. A case under Sections 121, 124-A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Chohan. Police also investigated Chohan's links with other Khalistani outfits in the World. Death Chohan withdrew himself from the public life in his later years.

She is best known for identifying the active agent in the antigen tuberculin as a protein, and subsequently for isolating a pure form of tuberculin, purified protein derivative (PPD), enabling the development and use of a reliable TB test. Seibert has been inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the National Women's Hall of Fame. Early life and education Seibert was born on October 6, 1897, in Easton, Pennsylvania, to George Peter Seibert and Barbara (Memmert) Seibert. At age three, Florence contracted polio. She had to wear leg braces and walked with a limp throughout her life. As a teenager, Seibert is reported to have read biographies of famous scientists which inspired her interest in science. Seibert did her undergraduate work at Goucher College in Baltimore, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1918. She and one of her chemistry teachers, Jessie E. Minor, did war-time work at the Chemistry Laboratory of the Hammersley Paper Mill in Garfield, New Jersey. Seibert earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Yale University in 1923. At Yale she studied the intravenous injection of milk proteins under the direction of Lafayette Mendel. She developed a method to prevent these proteins from being contaminated with bacteria. She was a Van Meter Fellow from 1921 - 1922 and an American Physiological Society Porter Fellow from 1922 - 1923, both at Yale University. Professional achievements and awards In 1923 Seibert worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Otho S.A. Sprague Memorial Institute at the University of Chicago. She was financed by the Porter Fellowship of the American Philosophical Society, an award that was competitive for both men and women. She went on to work part-time at the Ricketts Laboratory at the University of Chicago, and part-time at the Sprague Memorial Institute in Chicago. In 1924, she received the University of Chicago’s Howard Taylor Ricketts Prize for work she began at Yale and continued in Chicago. At Yale she reported a curious finding: intravenous injections often caused fever in patients. Seibert determined that the fevers were caused by toxins produced by the bacteria. The toxins were able to contaminate the distilled water when spray from the boiling water in the distillation flask reached the receiving flask. Seibert invented a new spray- catching trap to prevent contamination during the distillation process. She published her pyrogen-free process in the American Journal of Physiology. It was subsequently adopted by the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and various pharmaceutical firms. She was further recognized in 1962 with the John Elliot Memorial Award from the American Association of Blood Banks for her work on pyrogens. Seibert served as an instructor in pathology from 1924-28 at the University of Chicago and was hired as an assistant professor in biochemistry in 1928. In 1927, her younger sister Mabel moved to Chicago to live and work with her, employed variously as her secretary and her research assistant. During this time, she met Esmond R. Long MD PhD, who was working on tuberculosis. In 1932 she agreed to relocate, with Long, to the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. He became professor of pathology and director of laboratories at the Phipps Institute, while she accepted a position as an assistant professor in biochemistry. Their goal was the development of a reliable test for the identification of tuberculosis. The previous tuberculin derivative, Koch's substance, had produced false negative results in tuberculosis tests since the 1890s because of impurities in the material. With Long's supervision and funding, Seibert identified the active agent in tuberculin as a protein. Seibert spent a number of years developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) and enabling the creation of a reliable test for tuberculosis. Her first publication on the purification of tuberculin appeared in 1934. Some sources credit her with successfully isolating the tuberculosis protein molecule during 1937–38, when she visited the University of Uppsala, Sweden, as a Guggenheim fellow to work with Nobel-prize winning protein scientist Theodor Svedberg. She developed methods for purifying a crystalline tuberculin derivative using filters of porous clay and nitric-acid treated cotton. In 1938, she was awarded the Trudeau Medal of the National Tuberculosis Association. In the 1940s, Seibert's purified protein derivative (PPD) became a national and international standard for tuberculin tests. In 1943, Seibert received the first Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. She remained at the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania from 1932 to 1959. She was an assistant professor from 1932-1937, an associate professor from 1937-1955, a full professor of biochemistry from 1955-1959, and professor emeritus as of her official retirement in 1959. She and her sister Mabel then moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where Florence continued to research the possible relationships between bacteria and types of cancers, working with Mound Park Hospital and with the Bay Pines V.A. Research Center. She continued to publish scientific papers until 1977. Theories relating bacteria to cancer continue to be controversial. In 1968, Seibert published her autobiography - Pebbles on the Hill of a Scientist. Siebert received the Trudeau Medal from the National Tuberculosis Association in 1938, the Francis P. Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society in 1942, and induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1990. A historic marker was placed in her honor in Easton in 1993. She died at the Palm Springs Nursing Home in St. Petersburg, Florida on August 23, 1991. Dr. Florence Seibert Historical Marker in Easton, PA.

This historic building was created to replace an old grain exchange near the city's river. The name Alhóndiga translates roughly from both Arabic and Spanish as grain market or warehouse. It is equivalent to the regional grain exchange. Its construction lasted from 1798 to 1809, by orders of Juan Antonio de Riaño y Bárcena, a Spaniard who was the quartermaster of the city during the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla helped build it. The building received World Heritage listing as part of the Historic Town of Guanajuato in 1988.  Architecture  The Grain Exchange is an example of Neoclassical ideas. The original design was drafted in 1796 by Josė Alejandro Durán y Villaseñor, who was the master of public works. Josė de Mazo y Avilés modified the plans later. It measures 72 by 68 metres, with a height of 23 metres, and occupies an area of 4,828 square metres. It is constructed on the side of a hill and two of its sides are surrounded by elevations. There are no ornamental facets on the exterior, except for a few windows at the top of each storage room. It has cornices built in a Doric style, constructed with two types of regional stone--reddish and greenish. This gives it a curious appearance, resembling a stronghold or a castle, which it has come to be called by the people of Guanajuato. In the interior, there is a porch that leads to a spacious central patio. The porch contains Tuscan columns and adornments. There are two staircases that lead to the upper floor. The Grain Exchange building has only two access doors, a small one facing the east, adorned by two columns, and a large door of the same basic style, facing the north. The edifice was used for the buying and selling of wheat, corn, and other grains. Prior to the Mexican independence from Spain, it was used as a warehouse, military barracks, and prison. Currently it serves as a regional museum. History = Battle for Grain Exchange at Granaditas = The corner of the Grain Exchange where Hidalgo's head used to hang. A part of one of the two murals in the Grain Exchange When Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's insurgent troops threatened to take over this city during the Mexican War of Independence, Riaño secured himself in the Grain Exchange on 28 September 1810, along with many other Spaniards and some rich criollos. There were about 300 loyalists who took refuge from 20,000 rebels led by Hidalgo. Riaño believed that the strength of the building, its ample supplies and its positioning would make it easy to repel the insurgents' attacks. In addition to the corn the building already held, other provisions and twenty-four women were brought in to \\"make tortillas.\\" At first the building held, but soon the insurgents surrounded the building and began throwing rocks. Riaño died in this attack. His death caused \\"division and discord among the defenders of the Grain Exchange.\\" The insurgents decided to burn down the eastern door to be able to enter and attack those that were inside. According to a popular tradition the man chosen to perform this task was Juan José Martínez \\"El Pípila\\", an extraordinarily strong local miner. He is said to have tied a large flat stone to his back to protect himself from the bullet and rock storm expected once he entered. He poured petroleum on the door and lit it using a torch. When the door burnt down, the attackers stormed into the Grain Exchange, led by Martínez. Everyone inside the Grain Exchange was killed and the building sacked. Reportedly, blood stains from the attack could still be seen on the pillars of the building and the main staircase as late as 1906. At the end of the day, hundreds of bodies were buried, and the whole city of Guanajuato pillaged. This event would encourage Hidalgo not to attack Mexico City, afraid his followers would repeat the massacres and looting of Guanajuato. These first insurgents eventually fell. The four main participants - Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama, and José Mariano Jiménez - were shot by Spanish firing squads, and their bodies decapitated. The four heads were hung from the corners of the Grain Exchange, to discourage other independence movements. The heads remained hanging for ten years, until Mexico achieved its independence. They were then taken to Mexico City and eventually put to rest under el Ángel de la Independencia in 1910. In 1867, during the French Intervention in Mexico, the Emperor Maximilian ordered the Grain Exchange building to be converted into a prison. It remained a prison for nearly a century. Between 1955 and 1966, artist José Chávez Morado painted murals on the building reflecting the historical significance of the place. In 1958, the Grain Exchange opened officially as a museum. Public venue Attached to one side of the Grain Exchange is a large plaza with a set of wide steps that rise to meet the edge of the building. During the annual International Cervantino Festival, this space is converted into a large open air auditorium for live performances. The shows (often music and dance by groups of worldwide acclaim) are free to the general public, with reserved seats directly below the stage. Inside of the museum are exhibits and art honoring heroes of the Independence. The museum also holds a collection of Pre-Columbian art donated by Morado and his wife in 1975.
