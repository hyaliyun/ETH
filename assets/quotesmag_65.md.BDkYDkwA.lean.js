As of the 2010 census the population of Pancoastburg was 87. History Samuel Pancoast established a carding mill at Pancoastburg in the 1820s. It was a stage coach stop along the Chillicothe-Urbana line. The land was then owned by Isaiah Pancoast, who platted the town. The settlers of the area split into two groups, one group stayed in Pancoastburg, and the other settled Yankeetown a short distance away. About this time, the name of the community was changed to Waterloo. Yankeetown was short lived, and the settlers that had split off returned to the original site. By 1860, the name of the community was changed back to Pancoastburg. The Pancoastburg post office was originally established as \\"Pancoastburgh\\" on August 19, 1847.

He was also one of the chief architects who rebuilt Eaton Square in London's Belgravia district between 1945 and 1949 as part of the Temporary Housing Programme. Early life Raglan Squire, the eldest son of the poet and critic J C (later Sir John) Squire, was born in London and educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and at St John's College, Cambridge to read Architecture. Upon graduation Rag spent a year working on building sites, followed by four years working in architects' offices and studying part-time for his RIBA exams at the Regent Street Polytechnic's evening classes in the early 1930s. In 1937 Squire set up in practice and during World War II he served with the Royal Engineers and helped establish the RIBA Reconstruction Committee, many of whose recommendations were put into practice during the rebuilding of London after the war. Later career In 1948 Squire founded Raglan Squire & Partners; their early commissions including educational and industrial buildings. He was also involved in the redevelopment of Eaton Square in Belgravia, working for the Grosvenor Estate, in charge of the conversion of 100 houses in Eaton Square. In 1952 Squire embarked on his first major overseas project when he was commissioned to design the Engineering College at Rangoon University in Burma. He regarded this project as the high point of his career, and it opened the door to commissions all over the world. He was particularly proud of his design for the assembly hall at Rangoon. His other foreign work included a town planning scheme for Mosul in Iraq, and a report for Baghdad airport, both in 1955. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Raglan Squire & Partners was involved in several British projects, including large office blocks in Croydon and a notable factory at Farnborough. Squire was also much in demand abroad, particularly in Singapore and the Middle East, and had a long and fruitful relationship with the Hilton Hotel chain, including the Royal Tehran Hilton, the Tunis Hilton, the Cyprus Hilton in Nicosia, the Bahrain Hilton and the 400-room Jakarta Hilton. In the 1970s he worked in the Netherlands, Jamaica (where he designed the beachside Inter-Continental Hotel at Ocho Rios) and Malta; he also designed the spectacular Bank of America building in Singapore. Squire retired from active practice in 1981. The architect Michael Squire, of Squire and Partners, is his son, and is probably best known for redesigning the Chelsea Barracks.

It was opened in the 1660s and closed in 1960. Location HMS Clyde (left) and a sheer hulk (right) off Sheerness Dockyard at the time of the Nore Mutiny, 1797. In the Age of Sail, the Royal Navy would often establish shore facilities close to safe anchorages where the fleet would be based in home waters. This was the case when, around 1567, a Royal Dockyard was established at Chatham, Kent, on the bank of the River Medway. At that time, HM Ships would often lay at anchor either within the river, on Chatham Reach or Gillingham Reach, or beyond it, around The Nore. Chatham Dockyard had its disadvantages, however. The vagaries of wind and tide, coupled with the restricted depth of the river, meant that vessels entering the river, for repairs or to replenish supplies at Chatham, could be delayed for considerable lengths of time. What was an inconvenience at times of peace became a serious impediment at times of war; and for this reason, warships based in the Nore would tend if possible to avoid entering the river, and would try to do all but the most serious repairs while afloat and at anchor. At the same time, those who were responsible for supplying warships with their weapons, victuals and equipment were obliged to ferry items to and from The Nore using small boats. In order to operate more effectively, the Navy Board began to explore options for developing a new dockyard at the mouth of the Medway, able to be accessed by ships directly from the North Sea and Thames Estuary. Possible locations were explored on both the Isle of Grain and the Isle of Sheppey; the Board decided on a location at the north-west tip of Sheppey alongside a 16th- century blockhouse (built to supplement the Henrician defences of the Thames): Sheerness. The first dockyard The Dockyard c.1750, showing (left to right) the Henrician blockhouse (with flag), the mast house, a ship under construction on the slip, the tall white garrison gatehouse and various storehouses. Origins In 1665 Samuel Pepys, who was Clerk of the Acts of the Navy Board, recorded visiting Sheerness to measure out the site for the new dockyard. The situation was overtaken, however, by the escalating Anglo- Dutch conflict: in order to make the ships in The Nore battle-ready, temporary buildings were hastily erected. Work continued, but in 1667 the still- incomplete dockyard was easily captured, together with the adjacent fort, by the Dutch Navy and used as the base for a daring raid on the English ships at anchor in the Medway. Both fort and dockyard were left in flames, along with a significant number of the ships moored in the river. Early fortification Remnant of de Gomme's indented line on the eastern shore of Sheerness. In 1666 Sir Bernard de Gomme had been engaged to strengthen the blockhouse on the northern tip of the promontory. After the Dutch raid the following year, an expanded fort was planned. The blockhouse (which became the Governor's residence) was strengthened, and encircled by a semi-circular gun battery to the north, while to the south a line of fortification was constructed, which cut off the northernmost part of Sheerness behind a flooded ditch. A stone lion from the demolished 17th-century garrison gatehouse sits in front of Dockyard House. The garrisoned fort, enclosed by walls to the west and east, took up most of this fortified area, leaving the dockyard to occupy the remaining small parcel of land north of the ditch, on the Medway side of the fort (outside its western wall). A gateway through this wall, accessed from the dockyard, provided the main entrance to the fort; the gatehouse was a prominent feature and contained a chapel on its first floor. Eighteenth- century developments Sheerness Dockyard initially functioned as an extension to that at Chatham and it was overseen by Chatham's resident Commissioner for much of its early history. It was conceived primarily for the repair and maintenance of naval ships; with one small exception, no shipbuilding took place until 1691. Low quality housing, the poor water supply near the dockyard and a likelihood of contracting ague from the surrounding marshland all led to a lack of workers and caused construction delays. The first dry-dock was not completed until 1708; a second was added in 1720. Access to the two dry docks was by way of a tidal basin, tellingly known as the Mud Dock; there was a small shipbuilding slip to its north and an ordnance wharf to the south, with timber stores and a mast pond beyond. The constricted area of land available to the dockyard caused problems for its operation and development. Several hulks were positioned on the foreshore close to the dockyard, initially to serve as breakwaters, but soon they served to accommodate both personnel and dockyard activities. The space between the hulks (and, as they began to rot, the hulks themselves) were progressively infilled with soil, with new hulks then being added as part of the process. In this way, the land occupied by the dockyard began to expand (as is clearly seen in a surviving model of the dockyard, created in 1774 and now in the National Maritime Museum) By this time two more dry docks had been added, and over the next ten years living conditions were substantially improved by the sinking of a well to provide drinking water (which had previously had to be ferried in). By 1800 the Dockyard filled all available space and in addition was making use of several buildings within the walls of the Garrison Fort. Workers' housing There was no established settlement in the vicinity of Sheerness, so most of the workers were initially housed in the hulks. By 1738, dockyard construction workers had built the first houses in Sheerness, using materials they were allowed to take from the yard. The grey-blue naval paint they used on the exteriors led to their homes becoming known as the Blue Houses. This was eventually corrupted to Blue Town (which is now the name of the north-west area of Sheerness lying just beyond the current dockyard perimeter). The modern town of Sheerness has its origins in Mile Town, which was established later in the 18th century at a mile's distance from the dockyard (Blue Town having by then filled the space available). Outer fortifications In 1796, following the development of Blue Town, a wider area of land (including the new houses) was enclosed behind a bastioned trace, which was further strengthened during the Napoleonic Wars of the following century. In addition, a defensive straight canal had been dug south of Mile Town in 1782, two miles in length, stretching from the Medway to the Thames. The Great Rebuilding HMS Minotaur - receiving hulk), Admiralty House, covered Slip, (a schooner), flagstaff, the Dockyard Offices, the entrance to the Small Basin and part of the Victualling Store; in the foreground a naval picket boat. By the early nineteenth century, the old hulks underpinning the reclaimed land of the Dockyard were seriously decaying and the site was becoming increasingly unstable. The Dockyard, however, was getting busier, since it (unlike the nearby Chatham, Woolwich and Deptford yards) was not prone to silting. By 1810, designs had been submitted to the Controller of the Navy by both Samuel Bentham and John Rennie the Elder for a relatively modest rebuilding of the yard. Over the next three years, both Bentham and Rennie produced far more ambitious schemes: first, in 1812, Bentham drew up a radical panopticon-inspired proposal for the site, with docks, slips and storehouses all radiating from a central hub, which was occupied by a six-storey hexagonal office block; but it was Rennie's 1813 plan that gained approval. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the old Sheerness Dockyard was closed in 1815 and work began to Rennie's meticulous designs. The principal architect was Surveyor of Buildings to the Navy Board, Edward Holl, assisted by William Miller. After Holl's death in 1823, George L. Taylor (an established architect with a practice in London responsible for some of London's most fashionable squares) took over as principal. The plan was for an entirely new dockyard, at 56 acres more than double the size of the old one. The site's quicksand and mud banks provided a substantial civil engineering challenge; thousands of wooden piles had to be put in place to support the inverted arch foundations of the docks, wharves, basins and buildings. A scale-model created at the time shows in great detail the original design (foundations included) of each element. In all the project cost ¬£2,586,083 and was largely complete by 1830. Sheerness was unusual among Dockyards in the unity and clarity of its design, having been built in one phase of construction, of a single architectural style according to a unified plan (rather than developing piecemeal over time).Sheerness Dockyard's entry on the Buildings at Risk register. Layout The southern part of the rebuilt Dockyard as seen from the river, c.1835: (l-r) part of the Dockyard Offices, the Victualling Store, Quadrangle Storehouse, covered No.2 Dock, Working Mast House, the new Town Pier, Blue Town. The site was approximately triangular in shape when viewed from the air: Rennie's perimeter wall (1824-31) was built south-east from the Boat Basin (at the northernmost tip of the yard) running parallel with the Thames Estuary foreshore as far as the main gate, after which the wall (as can still be seen) turned southwards past the officers' houses, before turning sharply and continuing in a westerly direction as far as the river (though deviating south again at one point to accommodate the mast houses at the southern end of the site); the river then made up the third side of the triangle. The principal buildings and structures were laid out along the bank of the Medway; from north (i.e. Garrison Point) to South, these were: *The Ordnance Store and Wharf (a self-contained compound with its own basin, accessed via the Boat Basin). *The Boat Basin, providing access to: **No.1 (Building) Slip 200ft long **No.5 (Frigate) Dock (1819) 176ft long (but converted from a 'frigate dock' to a 'graving dock' in 1825) **No.4 (Frigate) Dock (1819) 177ft long *The Working Boat House (with boat slip giving access to the basin) *The Dockyard Offices (1821) *The Small Basin (used by supply craft), providing access to: **The Quadrangle Storehouse (1824-29; a landmark five-storey building topped by a clock tower) *The Victualling Storehouse (1826; facing the Offices across the entrance to the Small Basin) *The Great Basin (its entrance placed off-centre leaving room for a sizeable set of masting sheers), providing access to: **No.3 Dock (1819) 225ft long **No.2 Dock (1819) 225ft long **No.1 Dock (1819) 225ft long *A pair of Mast Houses (1826) with a Mast Pond between them. HMS Trafalgar, with her upper masts and spars removed, in the Great Basin at Sheerness (sketch by Henry Moses, 1824). The Great Basin, with its three dry docks, formed the Dockyard's centre of operations; they were designed to accommodate First Rate Ships of the Line. It was the first area of the yard to be completed and was formally opened by the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV) on 5 September 1823. (The next areas to be completed were the Small Basin and the Boat Basin, with its smaller pair of docks; construction of major buildings continuing for several years afterwards.) As part of Rennie's co-ordinated plan, all the dry docks were connected by a single culvert to the pump house in the south of the yard. Behind the three larger dry docks (Nos.1-3) were a pair of suppling kilns (1828), beyond which a long two-storey building (known today as the Archway Block, 1830) was built to Holl's design; it consisted of five interlinked blocks, each of five bays, housing saw pits and seasoning stores on the ground floor, with mould lofts, joiners' shops and other stores accommodated above. Its eponymous archway spanned a main east-west road in the Dockyard, at the far end of which stood the Dockyard Chapel (1828).Heritage At Risk listing Behind the Quadrangular Storehouse, and equal to it in length, the Smithery was built (begun in 1822). Further north, another suppling kiln and a smaller saw-pit building (1828) served the other docks (Nos. 4 & 5); there was also a pitch house (1829) nearby, designed by Taylor. Further south, behind the mast houses, there was a small foundry; it was destined to grow significantly in later years as use of metal in shipbuilding vastly increased. Dockyard Terrace Naval Terrace and the Dockyard Church. At the east end of the site, near the chapel, were grouped the main residential buildings pertaining to the senior officers of the Dockyard: *Dockyard House (1825) for the Captain Superintendent; *Dockyard Terrace (1827) for the Commander of the Dockyard and other senior officers; *Naval Terrace (1833) for more junior offices; *Boatswain's House (1826) for the boatswain. The Chapel (and the Naval Terrace alongside it) were placed outside the perimeter wall of the Dockyard. The area between the residences at the east end and the basins and docks to the west was initially kept clear, in large part, to allow for storage of timber; though the artesian well (dated, on the Well House, to 1800) which had so transformed life in the old Dockyard, was located here in relative isolation. In addition, the yard's Pay Office with its strong room (1828) was placed in this area, not too far from the main gate. The Garrison and fortifications The land to the north of the rebuilt Dockyard, lying between the perimeter wall and the Estuary foreshore, was almost entirely given over to the Garrison, which had been displaced by the rebuilding. On a long narrow strip of land was built officers' accommodation, guard houses, barrack blocks, a parade ground and (within the bastion at the southern end of the site) a gunpowder magazine. Along the estuary foreshore, a further line of fortification was constructed, connecting de Gomme's defences at the northern end with those south of Blue Town. All along the foreshore, a series of guns were placed; and in 1850 a new gun battery was installed in the Centre Bastion, designed to work in tandem with the new Grain Tower gun emplacement on the opposite side of the river. Ten years later, work began on replacing the old semi-circular gun battery on the promontory with a new casemated fort to replace the old blockhouse: Garrison Point Fort. Further south, the defensive canal (now known as Queenborough Lines) was also strengthened with a gun battery at either end. Admiralty House Between what became known as Garrison Point and the Garrison itself stood Admiralty House, a large residence built in 1829 for the Port Admiral. In May 1827, the Duke of Clarence, newly appointed to the office of Lord High Admiral, had ordered its construction on land purchased from the Board of Ordnance. The Duke himself did not make use of it (despite persistent rumours that he planned to move in); instead, Vice-Admiral Sir John Beresford took up residence and it went on to accommodate him and his successors as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore until 1907 (after which it housed the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet). Mechanisation The Engine House, seen over the perimeter wall in 1824. As here, steam power was first used in the Royal Dockyards to drain the dry docks. Before the rebuilding of Sheerness was complete, the Admiralty was beginning to invest in steam propulsion for warships, with the opening of its first Steam Factory at Woolwich Dockyard in 1831. This marked the start of an era of fast-paced technological change, and in the 1840s massive expansion took place at Portsmouth and Devonport to provide new basins and docks, which were served by factories, foundries, boiler-makers, fitting-shops and other facilities for mechanical engineering. The Royal Navy was still for the most part a sailing Navy at this stage, with steam providing auxiliary power rather than the main means of propulsion; this was to change over the course of the next thirty years. The rebuilt Sheerness, which had been designed primarily for the repair and maintenance of sailing ships, soon found itself having to adapt to the changing demands of steam technology. Most particularly, because Chatham Dockyard was not expanded and adapted for steam until the 1860s, Sheerness found itself under pressure to provide interim facilities for repair and maintenance of steam-powered ships based in the Nore. This became an immediate priority with the outbreak of the Crimean War: so in 1854, a new Steam Factory was built 'in haste' at Sheerness by Godfrey Greene, with the second mast house being converted into an engineering foundry and fitting shop. By 1868 just under 500 men and boys were employed in the factory; sited in the south part of the Dockyard, it was served by its own entrance (later called the South Gate) in the perimeter wall. Also in 1854, No.1 Dock and No.3 Dock were both lengthened to accommodate the larger ships now coming in for repair. The main Smithery, which stood behind the Quadrangle Store, had been provided with steam-powered hammers in 1846, and steam technology began to be used in various other parts of the yard; for instance, in 1856-8 a new steam- powered saw mill was built, to Greene's designs, replacing the manual saw pits built just 25 years earlier. Greene built a second Smithery in 1856, alongside the first, this time with an all-metal frame; a technique he took to new heights in 1858-60 with the building of a four-storey Boat Store (behind the Working Boat House), remarkable for its size, for its 'efficient storage and handling arrangement' and above all for its remarkable structural innovations: 'The all-metal frame was made rigid by portal bracing, subsequently adopted by the skyscraper pioneers in Chicago, and universal for modern steel-framed building'. The introduction of ironclad warships after Crimea led to further new buildings in and around the Dockyard. An assortment of mechanical workshops - fitting shops, bending shops, boiler shops - began to fill available space around the basins and docks, and by the end of the century the old Working Mast House had become a Shipwright's Machine Shop, nestled among foundries and factories. Shipbuilding at Sheerness HMS Atlanta, 'Built in his Majesty's Yard, at Sheerness, and Launched the 12th day of August, 1775'. In 1824, the Admiralty declared that Sheerness would continue to serve primarily as a refitting base, leaving Chatham Dockyard to focus on shipbuilding. Provision of a single covered slip, however, indicates that (as in the old yard) some shipbuilding was also envisaged. In the second half of the century, dry docks began to be used for shipbuilding to some extent (especially as many of the old slips became too small for the fast-expanding size of new warships). At Sheerness, No.2 Dock was designated for this purpose and (like the slip) covered with a long pitched roof. List of ships built at Sheerness Beginning with HMS Sheerness in 1677, over 100 ships were built at Sheerness Dockyard over a 225-year period, including the following: sloop HMS Gannet at Chatham Historic Dockyard, launched at Sheerness in 1878; an example of the smaller size of warship that was built in Sheerness Dockyard. *HMS Medway (1693) *HMS Newcastle (1704) *HMS Scarborough (1711) *HMS Montreal (1761) *HMS Solebay (1763) *HMS Winchelsea (1764) *HMS Carysfort (1766) *HMS Bristol (1775) *HMS Polyphemus (1782) *HMS Mermaid (1784) *HMS Daedelus (1826) *HMS Vestal (1833) *HMS Salamander (1832) - one of the first paddle steamers in the Royal Navy *HMS Calliope (1837) *HMS Acheron (1838) *HMS Rattler (1843) - the first warship to use screw propulsion *HMS Miranda (1851) *HMS Clio (1858) *HMS Diamond (1874) - the last purely wooden ship to be built at the dockyard *HMS Gannet (1878) - the only surviving Sheerness- built vessel *HMS Kingfisher (1879) *HMS Pylades (1884) - the last classic corvette built for the Royal Navy *HMS Buzzard (1887) *HMS Goldfinch (1889) *HMS Brilliant (1891) *HMS Torch (1894) *HMS Pelorus (1896) *HMS Shearwater (1900) *HMS Fantome (1901) *HMS Clio (1903) *HMS Cadmus (1903) - the last warship to be launched at Sheerness In the early 20th century, the Admiralty decided that shipbuilding should cease at Sheerness to allow the yard to focus on a new specialised role: refitting torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers. Dry docks 4 and 5 were accordingly lengthened in 1906 to enable them to accommodate the latter, and in 1912 the roof over the old shipbuilding dock (No.2 Dock) was demolished. This specialised work continued through World War I. After the war, to keep the yard from closing, it was occasionally sent vessels built by private contractors that required completion (such as HMS Thracian and the submarine HMS L27). During World War Two, when a flotilla of minesweepers was based at Sheerness, a number of motor-launches were built at the yard; but, as in the previous conflict, the main business of the yard was refit and repair of ships on active service. Education and training Barracks, Gunnery School and HMS Wildfire In 1854, a wing of the Victualling Store, which stood alongside the entrance to the Small Basin, was converted to serve as a Naval Barracks: a unique pre-20th century example of a shore building in Britain being used as a barracks for naval personnel. It seems to have been used to house very young ordinary seamen under training but awaiting posting to a training ship. Then, in 1892, the building as a whole was repurposed and reopened as a Royal Naval Gunnery School, providing specialist training in naval artillery. A training battery of 9-pounder guns was provided a few miles along the coast with a rifle range alongside. The school soon outgrew its accommodation; in 1908 it moved to new purpose-built accommodation alongside HMS Pembroke and the Victualling Store reverted to providing barracks accommodation. In 1937, the same building again found a new use, this time being commissioned as a boys' training establishment: HMS Wildfire. It remained in commission until 1950; after closure, the 'Wildfire Building' (as it had come to be known) again reverted to providing accommodation until shortly before the closure of the Dockyard. Dockyard apprentices As at other Royal Dockyards, a school for apprentices was established at Sheerness in 1842. Fifty years later it was given its own purpose-built accommodation. It was (again in common with equivalent institutions elsewhere) renamed as the Dockyard Technical College in 1952, before closing a few years later along with the rest of the yard. Closure and aftermath Main entrance in 2018: the old dockyard police station and police house (formerly linked by a colonnaded gateway, since demolished). In February 1958 it was announced in Parliament that Sheerness Dockyard would close. The garrison was decommissioned in 1959 and on 31 March 1960 the closing ceremony took place for the Dockyard; the dockyard closure led to all 2,500 dockyard employees being made redundant. Once the Royal Navy had vacated Sheerness dockyard, the Medway Port Authority took over the site for commercial use. In 1959, the First Lord of the Admiralty had announced that 'Seventeen residences and eight other buildings, including the quadrangle, the old Admiralty House and the dockyard church, [had] been listed under Section 30 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, as buildings of special architectural and historical interest.' Nevertheless, several of these very significant Dockyard buildings were demolished in the years that followed, including Admiralty House in 1964 and the Quadrangular Storehouse in 1978. The Small and Great Basins were also filled with rubble and covered over in the 1970s, along with Nos.1-3 Dry Docks, and to the east the former Garrison area was completely levelled. A high priority was placed on finding new employment for the local workforce. From 1974-1994 Olau Line operated a ferry service out of the northern part of the former Dockyard from Sheerness to Flushing. The rest of the site continued to be developed as a commercial port with much land reclamation taking place along the river bank and extending south of the former Dockyard site. A steelworks, established in 1971 on what had been military land to the south of the Dockyard, closed in 2012. Sheerness Dockyard today Navigation is controlled from a tower on the old Garrison Point Fort. The commercial port is currently operated by The Peel Group under the name London Medway.Peel Ports website As the local port authority, their Medway Ports division controls navigation on the River Medway from a headquarters in Garrison Point Fort. Legacy The former Dockyard Church in 2006 50 listed structures were destroyed at Sheerness in the 20 years following its closure; but while much of the former Dockyard has been lost, much still remains, and that has received greater recognition and attention in recent years. Historic England describes 'the whole dockyard' as 'a notable feat of marine engineering, with all the masonry carried on piles, represent[ing] the greatest piece of dock engineering by one of the great engineers of the C19'. A campaign by Save Britain's Heritage saw the former dockyard placed on the World Monuments Fund watch list in 2010, noting that: 'Despite terrible losses, the site still contains a wealth of historic buildings. The problem now is that a majority of these structures stand empty and decaying.' Much of the former residential quarter of the Dockyard had been sold to a property developer around the turn of the millennium. When planning permission was denied for its redevelopment in 2011, the Spitalfields Trust orchestrated its 'rescue and acquisition'; the area within the perimeter wall that was acquired (in the south-east corner of the former Dockyard) includes six Grade II* and four Grade II listed buildings which are now being restored and refurbished. In 2013, the trust also acquired the former Dockyard Church, which had been gutted by fire in 2001. A new charity was formed (the Sheerness Dockyard Preservation Trust) with a view to restoring the building and using it, among other things, to put Rennie's 1825 model of the Dockyard on public display. A National Lottery Heritage Fund grant in 2019 enabled the redevelopment by Hugh Broughton Architects to commence. The Grade I listed Boat Store in the heart of the commercial port Uncertainty remains, however, as to the future of other listed buildings within the former dockyard, above all: *the Grade I listed Boat Store, described as being 'of international significance in the development of modern architecture' due to its innovatory all-metal rigid frame construction. In 2015 it was placed by the Victorian Society on its top ten list of endangered buildings and it remains on the nation's Heritage at Risk Register.Heritage at Risk listing Along with the Boat Store a good number of other listed and unlisted buildings and structures survive, several of which are now also judged to have been innovatory in their use of metal as a construction material, for example: *The Grade II* listed Boat Basin with its docks and slip, including No.4 Dock: thanks to its surviving iron gates 'a uniquely complete example of early C19 dock technology, which Rennie perfected and refined'. *The Grade II* listed former Working Mast House, its cast iron frame 'part of an important strain in the early C19 development of metal and fire-proof structural systems, devised by Holl... One of the last surviving dock buildings from Rennie's planned dockyard, and one of only two examples of a once-common naval building type'. *The Grade II* listed Archway Block,'of considerable interest as a fire-proof integrated timber workshop within the elder Rennie's plan for the completely rebuilt yard. Forms a central part of a unique planned early C19 dockyard'. *The Grade II* listed North Saw Pits building, 'an example of the experimental iron construction developed by Rennie and Holl and pioneered in the dockyards. An important example of a free-standing iron frame, and forming part of a unique early C19 dockyard'. In 2016 the former Garrison Hospital of 1856, which had been threatened with demolition, was listed for being of special architectural and historic interest. Built on one of the defensive bastions outside the garrison gate, it latterly served as offices for the steelworks and is now owned by Peel Ports.

The case was important in clarifying what is meant by \\"manner of manufacture\\" in respects of patent applications in accordance with the Patents Act 1952 (Cth).. Facts The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) discovered a new method to apply known chemicals to the soil so as to kill weeds but not the crops. The chemicals were known to science but were never used in the process of eradicating weeds. NRDC applied for a patent for the new process. The Commissioner of Patents rejected the application on the grounds that it was not a \\"manner of manufacture\\" under section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies because * the invention was neither a new saleable product nor a new process for producing a saleable product * the invention involved an agricultural process which could not be a manner of manufacture * the invention was merely a new use for an existing product NRDC appealed under s. 49(4) to the Court as the Appeal Tribunal for the purposes of the Act. The case was argued before a Full Court. The complete specification in the present case contains six claims. Those numbered 4, 5 and 6 are for selective herbicidal compositions, and are not here in question. Claims 1, 2 and 3 are in these terms: # A method for eradicating weeds from crop areas containing a growing crop selected from leguminous fodder crops of the genera Trifolium and Medicago, celery and parsnip. # A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a lucerne (alfalfa) crop. # A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a clover crop. The Commissioner did not consider the new process a manner of manufacture and argued that the definition of invention is restricted to vendible products and processes for their production, and excludes all agricultural and horticultural processes. The appellant (NRDC), argued that the new process can be considered a \\"manner of manufacture\\" subject to the definition in the Patents Act 1990 and grant of privilege under s. 6 of the Statute of Monopolies if a process produces, either immediately or ultimately, an economically useful result. Issues The issue for the court was to determine if this new process of weed-killing constituted a \\"manner of manufacture\\" and could therefore be considered a patentable invention. The court had to consider whether it is enough that a process produces a useful result or whether it is necessary that some physical thing is either brought into existence or so affected as the better to serve man's purposes. Legal issues considered * NRDC brought the appeal under section 49 of the Patents Act 1952 which sets out the ground for acceptance of a patent request. * The definition of \\"manner of manufacture\\" was contained within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies * Section 6 Patents Act 1952; definition of \\"patent\\" as a \\"letters patent for an invention\\". * The Deputy Commissioner, and on the authority of Re Application by Standard Oil Development Co,Re Application by Standard Oil Development Co (1951) 68 114. LawCte records decided, in respect of each of the three claims, that the method claimed was not a manner of manufacture, his reason being that it did not result in any vendible product. * Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd,. the Commissioner alleged that NRDC's new process was merely a new use for an existing product pursuant to the precedent set in this case * G.E.C.'s Application,G.E.C.'s Application (1943) 60 1. LawCte records a test for assessing whether a method or process is a manner of manufacture was formulated in this case. It was held that a method or process is a manner of manufacture if it ::(a) results in the production of some vendible product or ::(b) improves or restores to its former condition a vendible product or ::(c) has the effect of preserving from deterioration some vendible product to which it is appliedIP Australia 2009, Patent Manual of Practice and Procedures 2.9.2.2 The outcome of the NRDC case, reduced these rules to guidelines and the notion of \\"vendible\\" and \\"product\\" should be given a broad interpretation, pursuant to the broad interpretation of \\"manner of manufacture\\" in section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. Decision (i) Processes may be patented provided that it produces a material advantage and has a new and useful effect that produces a physical product.Lexis Nexis, Australian Encyclopedia of Forms & Precedents, (at 16 September 2009), Patents, [1596‚Äì1675] (ii) NRDC's new process made use of existing chemicals that had never been used in eradicating weeds. A new use of a known substance is patentable provided the use takes advantage of a previously unknown property.IP Australia 2009 That is it must be used in a way that it has never been used or thought to use previously. Therefore, in this case, it is the process not the article that constitutes the invention. (iii) The outcome of this new process was only arrived at by scientific ingenuity and research and is considered a vendible product because it created an artificial state of affairs in respect of weeds and crops and achieved an economically useful result. (iv) Agricultural and horticultural processes are not outside the limits of patentable inventions provided they are not excluded by any other of the \\"traditional principles\\" as in the case of NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd,. and the new agricultural and horticultural processes produce a new and useful product.IP Australia 2009, 2.9.2.15 References Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:Australian property law Category:Australian patent case law Category:1959 in case law Category:1959 in Australian law ","title":"National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents"},{"id":"24698021","text":"Air Vice Marshal Andrew MacGregor, (25 October 1897 ‚Äì 24 October 1983) was a First World War flying ace credited with six aerial victories--including three scored with James Grant as his gunner‚Äîand a senior commander in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

Though independently owned by the Robert Lessenberry family of Glasgow, the line is operated under long-term lease by CSX Transportation, as corporate successor to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. As such, the company has no locomotives or operable rolling stock, and apparently has noreporting mark assigned to it. The Glasgow Railway connects its namesake city with the former L&N;'s namesake main line at Park City, which itself was formerly named Glasgow Junction. History The line began as the Barren County Railroad Company, and was built in 1856, with the intention of connecting with the L&N;, then itself under construction. According to Lessenberry, county leaders raised taxes to fund the line, which angered resident of the eastern portion of the county. That portion seceded and eventually became part of neighboring Metcalfe County. That company was sold to three local businessmen, including prominent attorney William Logan Porter, in 1868 and renamed the Glasgow Railroad Company. The men later sold the line to the Glasgow Railway Company in 1899. Current The only surviving rolling stock of the Glasgow Railway is passenger car 109, which is one of only a handful of such cars in a Jim Crow configuration remaining in existence. The car is in an advanced state of decay, despite various efforts to save it over the years, and sat on a siding near the line's terminus in Glasgow for decades. In 2011, the car was moved to The Historic Railpark and Train Museum in nearby Bowling Green, where efforts are underway to restore the car. It was used on the daily (sometimes twice-daily) mixed train that ran from Glasgow to the L&N; connection. The line is freight-only, serving numerous factories in Glasgow.

According to Secret Intelligence Service operative Captain Fred Holroyd, British Army Captain Robert Nairac was involved in Green's killing. Green's was one of the 87 killings attributed by the Pat Finucane Centre to the group of loyalist extremists known as the Glenanne gang.Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster Area in the mid-1970s. . Retrieved 15-12-10 No one was ever prosecuted for the killing.  Provisional IRA  Green was born in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland and grew up in a Roman Catholic family. He was an active member of the civil rights campaign, and later joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army. He held the rank of Staff Captain and Intelligence Officer in the North Armagh Brigade. Green was forced to \\"go on the run\\" following the introduction of internment in August 1971, but was arrested and interned on the Maidstone prison ship. Green was afterwards transferred to Long Kesh internment camp. On 9 September 1973, Green escaped from Long Kesh disguised as a priest. During a visit with his brother, Fr. Gerrard Green, a Catholic priest, the two men exchanged clothing, and Green made his escape undetected by the guards. Gerrard was later discovered tied up in one of the prison's compounds.  Killing  Following his escape, Green lived in the Monaghan and Castleblayney areas. An Irish government agent, Sean O'Callaghan, states he met Green at an IRA training camp in County Kerry at the end of 1973. During the IRA Christmas ceasefire in 1974, Green returned home to Lurgan to visit his family. While he was there the British Army arrived at his house and carried out a routine check-up, the Green family being prominent republicans. On the evening of 10 January 1975, he drove to a farmhouse in Mullyash, outside Castleblayney. When the farmer, an elderly republican sympathiser, went to tend a neighbour's cow, Ulster loyalist gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade kicked down the front door and shot Green six times in the head at close range, killing him instantly. To the Ulster Volunteer Force in mid-Ulster, Green was a high- profile target. According to journalist Peter Taylor, the killers left behind some bullets in the shape of the letters UVF. The UVF claimed responsibility for the killing in the June 1975 edition of its magazine Combat. Green's killing occurred during an IRA ceasefire, which had been declared the previous month. Allegations It was claimed by Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Special Patrol Group (SPG) officer John Weir, that the UVF killers were Robin Jackson (who was also allegedly involved in the 1974 Dublin car bombings as well as a series of sectarian killings), Robert McConnell, and Harris Boyle. The men, including Weir, were all members of the Glenanne gang, which was made up of rogue elements of the RUC, Ulster Defence Regiment, regular British Army, and the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. These allegations were published in the 2003 Barron Report, which was the findings of an official investigation of the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. In the same report, Weir claimed that he had received information from an informer that British Army captain Robert Nairac was also involved in Green's killing. The 1993 Yorkshire Television documentary The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre states that Robin Jackson and his UVF comrades were controlled by Nairac, who was attached to 14th Intelligence Company. Secret Intelligence Service operative Captain Fred Holroyd also asserted that Nairac had executed Green, who was, according to Holroyd, commander of the Provisional Battalion of North Armagh. Captain Holroyd claimed that Nairac boasted about the killing and had shown him a colour polaroid photograph of Green's corpse taken after the killing. Holroyd also told the Garda S√≠och√°na that he had received a photograph of Green some months prior to his killing. Holroyd enlarged the photograph and had it distributed. He believed from that time until Green's death, 4 Field Survey Troop, one of the three sub-units of the 14th Intelligence Company led by Captains Nairac and Tony Ball, had Green placed under surveillance.The Barron Report (2003): The murder of John Francis Green. p.20. Retrieved 31-01-11 Nairac's claim has been discounted by two Garda investigations which revealed that the polaroid was one of a series taken of Green's body by a Garda officer the morning following his fatal shooting.The Barron Report (2003): the murder of John Francis Green. pp.1‚Äì20 Years after the death of John Francis Green, journalist Peter Taylor conducted an interview with his brother, Leo, who had been a key figure in the 1980 hunger strike at the Maze Prison. When asked about John Francis' killers, Leo told Taylor he believed they had been \\"loyalists or British Army or a combination of both\\". Green went on to add that the UVF's motives for killing his brother may not have been solely on account that John Francis was a prominent IRA member. > I would suggest that it would have annoyed the loyalists that there was a > [IRA] truce with the British Government and there may well have been fear > that some sort of negotiated settlement was going on behind their backs. > Probably my brother's killing would have been designed to anger and provoke > the IRA into breaking the truce.Taylor, p.143 Aftermath A post-mortem revealed that John Francis Green had been shot six times in the head at close range, the bullets all having entered from the front.The Barron Report (2003): The murder of John Francis Green, p.4 At the time of his death, Green was married and the father of three children. After his killing, the Garda√≠ found Green's car (a Volkswagen Beetle) parked beside the house. They discovered weapons, ammunition and documents hidden behind the backseat. In the glove compartment were 26 photographs of members of the Provisional and Official IRA, all of whom were wanted by the security forces in Northern Ireland. A further search inside the house and the grounds disclosed more ammunition and bomb-making materials.The Barron Report (2003): The murder of John Francis Green, pp.2‚Äì3, 9 Green's killing was one of 87 which the Pat Finucane Centre has linked to the Glenanne gang, a group comprising rogue elements of the British Army, the RUC, SPG, UDR, and military intelligence, which together with the UVF, carried out a series of sectarian attacks in the Mid-Ulster/South Armagh area in the 1970s.Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster Area in the mid-1970s According to the Barron Report (2003), a Luger pistol used in Green's killing was linked six months later to the Miami Showband killings, which left three band members dead.The Barron Report (2003) Both Robin Jackson and Robert Nairac were allegedly behind that attack, while Harris Boyle was blown up after the bomb he and Wesley Somerville (another UVF and Glenanne gang member) had placed in the band's minibus had gone off prematurely. Martin Dillon, in his book The Dirty War, claims that Nairac was not involved in Green's killing, nor the Miami Showband attack. In his 2015 biography of Nairac, retired diplomat Alistair Kerr produced evidence that clears Nairac of involvement in both the Green killing and Miami Showband ambush. Captain Robert Nairac was abducted and killed in 1977 by the IRA. On 7 April 1977, the South Armagh Republican Action Force claimed responsibility for shooting dead Protestant man Hugh Clarke at Tullymacreeve near Forkill, County Armagh.Sutton Index of Deaths: 1977. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) The book Lost Lives says that the IRA shot Clarke. It adds: \\"the IRA claimed Hugh Clarke was involved in the killing of IRA member John Francis Green. On the night of the Green killing, he had been at the house where the IRA man's body was found\\".McKittrick, David. Lost Lives.

The film was based on a novel of same name ‡¶ù‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ written by Saradindu Bandyopadhyay, though the ending has been totally altered from that in the novel, whose base plot was adapted from the 1894 novel The Prisoner of Zenda by Anthony Hope. The book had already been adapted into English-language films in 1937 and 1952, and later, in 1979. Soumitra Chatterjee is cast, uncharacteristically, in a villainous role in the film. Sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan directs the music. Plot A person comes to meet Gauri Shankar Roy (Uttam Kumar), who lives in Kolkata. He introduces himself as a 'fauji Sardar' (Chief of the Armed Forces) of Jhind, Jhind being a small kingdom in Madhya Pradesh. He says that the to-be King of Jhind, Shankar Singh, was found missing from the kingdom right before his coronation; this is apparently a conspiracy by his own brother Udit Singh, who wants the kingdom for himself. Earlier, too, there were two occasions when coronation was arranged, but on both occasions, the King was found missing. Udit is a cruel man, unfit to be a good king. Shankar Singh has his vices too, but is a kind-hearted person who would care for his citizens and is thus worthy to be king. Now, coincidentally, Gauri looks exactly like Shankar Singh (also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, the fauji Sardar requests him to pretend to be the King for the coronation and until the real King can be found. Gauri agrees. The two set off for Jhind. Things aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The coronation however takes place successfully; moreover, the pretend King becomes engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi) on the occasion. In spite of the situation becoming more and more tense, with the life of the King at stake, a romance blooms between Kasturi Bai and Gauri. A secret agent reveals that the real King is hidden in a fortress owned by Udit, who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. The fauji Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then-Dewan of Jhind, Kali Shankar Roy. The then-king being issue less, adopted Shankar and Udit as sons. After a secret entry to the fortress where the King is being held prisoner, Gauri fights a battle with Mayurvahan, finally killing him as well as surprising and killing Udit. As he approaches his look-alike Shankar Singh, he has a momentary desire to kill the King and gain the kingdom for himself, he being as deserving by blood as Shankar Singh; but his humanity wins over and he approaches the King respectfully, addressing him as \\"Your Highness\\". He then bids a last goodbye to Kasturi Bai and mounts a horse to head back to Kolkata.

Rated as a Caporal, he was initially assigned to 2a Squadriglia for a short spell. On 28 August 1916, he was posted to a fighter squadron, 78a Squadriglia. On 1 March 1917, he was promoted to Sergente. By now, he was engaging in serious dogfights, during one of which he was seriously wounded but continued fighting. On 10 May 1917, he was awarded a Silver Medal for Military Valor for his tenacity in this engagement. Nevertheless, the wound did not prevent him from scoring his first aerial victory on 17 June, when he forced an enemy Albatros to land. On 18 July, Magistrini backed Guido Nardini on the latter's victory, but Magistrini's own victory claim for participation was denied. He would stake one more unconfirmed claim before transferring to 91a Squadriglia on 1 November. On 23 November, Magistrini shared a victory with Bartolomeo Costantini. One week later, in concert with Ferruccio Ranza and Gastone Novelli, he shot down a German two-seater, killing both members of its air crew. On 7 December 1917, Magistrini and Ranza shared in the kill of an Austro-Hungarian Hansa-Brandenburg C.I.

This time, during the May to August award period, he would be rewarded with a further Bronze Medal for Military Valor. Also in 1942, he received the Silver Medal for Aeronautical Valor to honor his two million kilometers of flight. After World War II, Magistrini was hired as a personal pilot by the King of Yemen. When he was done flying, Magistrini had logged over 22,000 flight hours. Sources of information References * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

Their performance was recorded and released by Recommended Records in 1996 on a live album entitled p53. The group reassembled in May 1997 to play at the Angelica International Festival of contemporary music in Bologna, Italy. In November 2006 an orchestral version with three soloists, Jon Rose, Zeena Parkins and Chris Cutler performed with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow, Scotland, which was recorded and broadcast by the BBC in March 2007. This version was performed again at the Opera House in Milan in 2014 with the Orchestra de Teatro Communale, with soloists Daan Vandewalle and Thomas Dimuzio. p53 was a musical improvisational project that centred on the music of two classical grand pianists, accompanied by percussion, homemade guitar, turntable scratching, and real-time sampling/processing of the pianists. History In 1994 English percussionist Chris Cutler was asked by the organisers of the 25th Frankfurt Jazz Festival in Germany as to whether he had a project for the event. Cutler said \\"yes\\" and took the opportunity to try out a new musical idea involving \\"real-time montaging\\" that he had been contemplating. He used the festival's generous budget to form a quintet of musicians from around the world. Billed as \\"The Chris Cutler Project\\" before there was time to give it its name, p53 consisted of Cutler (percussion, electronics), German classical pianist Marie Goyette (grand piano), Polish classical pianist and composer Zygmunt Krauze (grand piano), German composer and performer Lutz Glandien (samples, real-time processing), and Japanese composer and multi-instrumentalist Otomo Yoshihide (turntables, homebuilt guitar). p53's performance at the Frankfurt Jazz Festival was filmed and later broadcast several times on German television. An album of the concert called p53 was also released by Recommended Records in 1996. In May 1997 p53, with the same lineup, performed for the second time at the Angelica International Festival of contemporary music in Bologna in Italy. An extract from this performance appeared on the Angelica 1997 compilation CD. The orchestral version was first performed in November 2006, in Glasgow, with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Ilan Volkov. Volkov also conducted it in Bologna in 2014, at the Angelica Festival with the Orchestra del Teatro Communale, where the soloists were Daan Vandewalle and Thomas Dimuzio. A chamber version of the piece was performed at the Techtonics festival in Tel Aviv in November 2014, with soloists Maya Dunietz, Tim Hodgkinson and Chris Cutler, under the direction of Ilan Volkov. Music The instrumentation of the original p53 project consisted of two grand pianos, amplified turntables, a homemade electric guitar, percussion, electronics and real time processing. One of the pianists was instructed to play \\"a few small sections from the classical repertoire\\", in any way and at any tempo, while the other musicians were free to improvise around them, under certain dramaturgical rules. Glandien periodically played back amplified and distorted live samples of the pianists. Name The group's name was taken from the p53 tumour suppressing gene that was discovered in 1979 by David P. Lane and others. Because of its role in preventing cancer, the gene has been described as \\"the guardian of the genome\\" Members ;1994 and 1997 lineup *Chris Cutler ‚Äì drums, objects, low grade electronics *Marie Goyette ‚Äì grand piano *Zygmunt Krauze ‚Äì grand piano *Otomo Yoshihide ‚Äì turntables, homebuilt guitar *Lutz Glandien ‚Äì computer, samples, real-time processing ;2006 lineup *Chris Cutler ‚Äì percussion *Jon Rose ‚Äì violin *Zeena Parkins ‚Äì harp Discography Albums *p53 (1996, CD, Recommended Records, U.K.) Appears on *Various artists: Angelica 1997 (1998, CD, Dischi di Angelica, Italy) ‚Äì includes one p53 track Footnotes References External links *.

It was their debut album and was recorded at the 25th Frankfurt Jazz Festival in Germany on 1994. It was released in 1996 in the United Kingdom by Recommended Records. p53 was a musical improvisational project that involved two classical grand pianists, a percussionist, a homemade guitarist and turntablist, and a real-time sampler/processor. Music The instrumentation of the p53 project consisted of two grand pianos, amplified turntables, a homemade electric guitar, percussion, electronics and real time processing. Cutler's interest in sampling and turntablism began when it became possible to \\"play\\" them as instruments, and not just \\"run them in\\". This led to the idea of \\"real-time montaging\\", which formed the basis of p53. Cutler established p53 as a free improvisation project within a predetermined structure to investigate the notion of making \\"improvisation a compositional endeavour\\". Cutler wanted it to question the nature of music and how listening to music has changed. He wanted to \\"pit acoustic sounds and the classical music tradition\\", two grand pianos, against \\"electronic timbres and the contemporary sound world\\", amplified turntables, electric guitar, computer generated sounds and real-time processing. He also wanted to contrast the difference between \\"early 20th century concert listening and the channel-hopping aesthetic of the fin de siecle '90's\\". The pianists were instructed to play \\"a few small sections from the classical repertoire\\", in any way and at any tempo, while the other musicians were free to, according to Rick Anderson of AllMusic, \\"romp around them wreaking gleeful havoc\\". Glandien periodically played back amplified and distorted live samples of the pianists, making them, in effect, human samplers, providing raw material for him to manipulate. Reception Peter L. Herb of Wired magazine described p53 as a \\"surrealist adventure that must have been stunning to witness\\". He added that \\"the disc's transitions from sonic tranquillity to chaos and back are unpredictable and delightfully abrupt. It's comforting that someone somewhere is still ignoring musical orthodoxy.\\" Rick Anderson of AllMusic said while p53 is not the \\"stuff for everyone\\", \\"for those with ears to hear, [it] is one of the most enjoyable albums to come from the avant-garde scene in years.\\" Track listing #\\"p53\\" (Cutler, Goyette, Krauze, Glandien, Yoshihide) ‚Äì 44:08 Personnel *Chris Cutler ‚Äì drums, objects, low grade electronics *Marie Goyette ‚Äì grand piano *Zygmunt Krauze ‚Äì grand piano *Otomo Yoshihide ‚Äì turntables, homebuilt guitar *Lutz Glandien ‚Äì computer, samples, real-time processing Production and artwork *Recorded at the 25th Frankfurt Jazz Festival, Germany on 16 September 1994 *Edited by Chris Cutler and Dominique Brethes at Wolf Studios, London *Mastered by Chris Cutler and Lutz Glandien at Elsenstudio, Berlin *Cover artwork by Peter Blegvad *Graphic design by Jonathan Crossland *Liner notes by Chris Cutler References External links *.

(Elena Maugini and Luca Fabbri editors), p266, Florence, 1997 After several years of agronomic field trials and extension in Libya and laboratory research in Florence, he was appointed director of the Istituto agricolo coloniale italiano (Italian Agricultural Colonial Institute) in 1924. He worked there through the era of Italian colonial expansion, the Second World War, and the reshaping of the institute to its current form in 1953 holding the position of director until 1964, when his collaborator and friend Ferdinando Bigi was appointed as new director until 1968.AA. VV. L'Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare la sua storia, Florence, 2007 He ran the magazine L'agricoltura coloniale, later known as Rivista di agricoltura tropicale e subtropicale, and published several books and hundreds of articles on the topics dealt with by his institute.Armando Maugini 1966. \\"Sviluppo agricolo e progresso sociale nei paesi tropicali\\". IAO, Florence. 556 p. He enhanced staff technical skills and material endowments and established a net of collaborations with professionals and institutions worldwide. A shy and resolute man, pressing his resolutions with the touch of the countryside gentleman, Maugini was respected by colleagues and authorities, and enjoyed the trust of the farmers as well as of the international scientific and academic community. Trained as an agro- economist, he worked in Africa at the start of his career. He was appointed director of \\"Agricultural services\\" in the Cyrenaica colony in eastern Libya, studying the flora and agricultural traditions of the Libyan society. Back in Italy he organized the exploration and analysis of the natural and agricultural resources of tropical regions, assisting Italian agricultural colonization initiatives in Africa and in the Eastern Mediterranean islands between the two World Wars, and later the migration of Italian farmers to Latin America. His hands-on approach to the African environment and human dynamics resulted in precious advice on the valorization of ethnic and traditional knowledge and skills and the integration of indigenous dynamics in the shaping of the plantation enclave economy, thus containing the amount of metropolitan farmers settling in the Italian colonies. His legacy includes a rich archive and photographic documentation on the Italian presence and work in Africa, the Mediterranean islands and Latin America, as well as on the environment and agriculture of the tropical and sub-tropical regions, stored at the Documentation Center and the Photographic Archive of the Istituto agronomico per l'oltremare.

In the 1950s, he appeared in a number of other high-profile films, notably Les Diaboliques, And God Created Woman and Ascenseur pour l'√©chafaud. His later career was spent mainly in television, where he specialised in voiceover work. 1950s At the age of 11, Poujouly was chosen by film director Ren√© Cl√©ment for the role of Michel Doll√©, befriender of the orphaned Paulette (Brigitte Fossey), in the World War II drama Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits). The film was not greatly successful on its original release in France, but struck a chord with audiences and critics in other countries and went on to win numerous awards, including the 1952 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Forbidden Games is considered a classic of French cinema, and the spare, haunting performances of Poujouly and Fossey among the most notable of screen performances by child actors.James Travers, filmsdefrance.com In 1952, Poujouly played the role of Michel le Guen in Andr√© Cayatte's We Are All Murderers (Nous sommes tous des assassins). In 1954, he played the main character in a famous audio recording of Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, alongside G√©rard Philipe as the narrator. He played smaller parts in Henri-Georges Clouzot's celebrated 1955 suspense film Les Diaboliques and Roger Vadim's And God Created Woman (Et dieu...cr√©a la femme) in 1956. A more substantial role, as a car thief turned killer, came in 1958 in the Louis Malle-directed thriller Ascenseur pour l'√©chafaud, with Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet.Biography at Allocine.com (in French) Later career From the 1960s, Poujouly worked mainly in television, with film appearances limited to small roles in such as Vice and Virtue (1963) and Is Paris Burning? (Paris br√ªle-t-il?) (1966). He appeared in a number of TV serials and moved into voice acting. Between 1959 and 1962 Poujouly was the voice of Tintin in two animated series based on Herg√©'s books. In later years his voiceover credits included the Michael Douglas character Steve Keller in the French TV version of The Streets of San Francisco and Merry in the 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings. Death Poujouly's last-known credit is Robinson et compagnie, a 1991 animated French language film version of Robinson Crusoe. Little is known of the last years of his life.

It is an American B-movie in which the plot revolves around a modern couple who dream that they are Adam and Eve. Others of their acquaintance assume the roles of various characters from the Book of Genesis during the fantasy sequences. Plot A bus heading toward Reno, Nevada, is being driven by Doc Bayles, whose passengers include a traveling salesman (Hal Sanders) and a runaway teen (Vangie Harper). Feuding couples begin boarding. A waitress, Evie Simms, wants to go to Reno to divorce her husband Ad, having caught him kissing Lil Lewis, a neighbor. Lil wants a divorce from her own husband, casino boss Nick Lewis, who tries to catch up to the bus in a broken-down car belonging to Pinkie Parker, a beatnik. A jealous Nick commandeers the bus when Doc briefly gets off and then inadvertently drives Ad off a cliff, nearly killing him. When a raging storm heads everyone's way, they take shelter in a church. Ad and Evie fall asleep and seem to have the same dream, that they are in the original Garden of Eden, facing temptations from the Devil that could affect the future of all mankind. When they wake up, the storm has passed. The travelers pair off, Ad with Evie, and Lil with Nick, and Vangie with Pinkie, to see where the road takes them next.

Prokofiev also created an orchestral four movement suite from the ballet (Op. 41b). Origin G. Yakulov. Scene model for the ballet Le pas d'acier (1927) The ballet was commissioned by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who had been greatly impressed by the exhibition in Paris in 1925 of Russian contemporary artists at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts, and was originally intended to \\"celebrate Soviet industrialization.\\"Taruskin (2010), 776. Prokofiev wrote the score, based on a scenario by the Constructivist artist Georgi Yakulov and himself, in 1925‚Äì1926, much of it during his tour of the United States. Prokofiev wrote that his music represented \\"a move towards a Russian musical language, not that of the Fairy Tales of [the folklorist] Afanasyev, but one which could describe contemporary life. [...It] was a decisive step leading me towards chromaticism and diatonics [...] A whole series of themes is composed solely for the white keys.\\" Cited in Samuel (1971), 98‚Äì99. The original scenario was titled Ursignol, and was approved by Diaghilev in the autumn of 1925.Sayers (2000), 163‚Äì4. It appears however that over the next two years the story-line was changed, against Yakulov's wishes, as Diaghilev made preparations for the first production.Sayers (2000), 166. The original scenario was rooted in scenes of Soviet life, of which Yakulov had experience (but the √©migr√©s Prokofiev and Diaghilev did not), involving speculators, sailors and workers, and with scenes in a station, a market and a factory, centered on life in the early Soviet Union.Sayers (2000), 167‚Äì71. The factory scene features machines and sprocketed wheels as the setting for a danced romance between a sailor and a young girl worker. Premiere Although no record of the choreography of the eventual 1927 production has survived, it is clear from the comments of critics that the scenario had been altered from the original so as to include scenes of Russian folklore (which were a typical element of Ballets Russes productions.Sayers (2000), 171‚Äì5. With choreography by L√©onide Massine, the Ballets Russes premiered the work in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt on June 7, 1927.Samuel (1971), 99 n.2. Critical reaction was extremely mixed. The critic Andr√© Levinson wrote: > In this architectural decor agitates a poor drama, undecided between > enthusiasm for Bolshevism and bitter irony.

Neither one nor the > other, it seems to me, the superficial eccentricity conceals the pain of a > fundamental emptiness and a dishonest conception.Cited in Sayers (2000) > 174‚Äì5. Richard Taruskin notes that Igor Stravinsky, (from whose Rite of Spring Taruskin claims the Le pas d'acier \\"poached a bit\\"), \\"declared that it made him ill.\\"Taruskin (2010), 776. Wilhelm Furtwangler conducted a suite from the ballet in concert with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1929. Performance history Le pas d'acier was a major success for Prokofiev and Diaghilev in Paris, where it was performed for three consecutive seasons. Diaghilev was a confirmed supporter of Prokofiev's compositions, going so far as to term him \\"my second son\\" (Stravinsky being his metaphorical \\"first\\"), and Diaghilev's death in 1929 removed Prokofiev's primary source of ballet commissions and practical support in the field in Paris and the West. The ballet was performed under new choreography and cast at the Bolshoi Theatre with the help of Prokofiev's friend Boris Gusan. It was also performed in London and, in 1931, in the USA, where the Philadelphia Public Ledger commented \\"one wonders whether [the ballet] is propaganda or music.\\"Cited in Samuels (1971), 99. Revival After 1931, the next performance of the ballet was in 2005, when it was staged at Princeton University, New Jersey. This production was described as \\"faithful to the original, never-performed concept of a celebration of Soviet workers' lives, instead of a mockery of them, which was the version seen by audiences of the early 20th century.\\"Altmann (2005)  References  Sources *Altmann, Jennifer Greenstein (2005). \\"Le Pas d‚ÄôAcier: The Steel Step\\" in Princeton Weekly Bulletin, vol.94 no. 17 (February 21, 2005).

Based on the Mahabharatha, it tells the story of King Nalan and his consort Damayanthi. The play consists of four parts ‚Äì called First, Second, Third and Fourth Day ‚Äì each part being long enough to be performed over a full night. The source of the story is the tale of Nalan and Damayanthi as told in the Mahabharatha . In the 18th century, Unnayi Warrier structured the contents of this story as Nalacharitham Attakatha to suit the art-form Kathakali. Nalacharitham is a considered the most romantic work of art constructed on the classical basement of Kathakali, which has earned it the epithet of being the Shakuntalam of Malayalam literature.\\"Of heroism and romance\\" From The Hindu, Jan 14, 2016  First Day: Nalcharitham Onnam Divasam  Story line: Sage Naradan tells Nalan about Damayanthi and the need to marry her. Hamsam acts as the messenger to Damayanthi and fills her mind with love for Nalan. Scene 1 ‚Äì Nalan and Naradan Sage Naradan reaches Nalan's kingdom Nishadha and tells Nalan that in Kundinapuri, there is a beautiful damsel named Damayanthi who is sought after even by gods and he should marry her. Nala wonders what right he, as human being, had to contest with the gods to marry her. But Naradan assures him that as a king, he should endeavour to do it. The Sage wishes him all success and takes leave. Nalan indulges in thoughts about the beauty of Damayanthi. He visualises her in all splendor in every part of her body and comes to the conclusion that he will have no peace of mind until he marries her. He is so astounded by the lascivious charm of Damayanthi that he entrusts his duties as the King to his Minister and goes to the royal garden to find some peace of mind. Scene 2 ‚Äì Nalan in the royal garden In the royal garden, Nalan, aroused by the description of the beauty of Damayanthi, is further disconcerted by the breeze carrying the perfumes of flowers, the trees embraced by flowering jasmine plants, the dancing peacocks and the sound of sweet-singing birds. He sees three swans of different colours on the banks of the pond nearby, of which a golden one engrosses his attention immensely. Scene 3 ‚Äì Entry of Hamsam (the golden swan); Nalan and Hamsam On the banks of the river, the golden swan spends some time singing and dancing, eating lotus fruits and then rests on a lotus leaf. Nalan observes that swan of exquisite beauty during his wandering in the garden distraught in his thoughts about the damsel Damayanthi. He catches the bird unawares in its sleep without disturbing it. The swan, finding itself captured, starts crying loud that the king is killing it. It is worried about its fate and the thought of its old mother, wife and children becoming orphans in its absence. The King says that he had no intentions of hurting it. He only thought of possessing that virtuous and golden bird. He allows the bird to fly away freely. When the bird is gone, Nalan once again falls back into his reverie about Damayanthi. Hamsam, extremely pleased with the righteousness of the King, returns to thank the King and to do something in return for his kindness. It tells the King that it would help him to marry. The bird captures the King's heart by describing the beauty and character of Damayanthi. In addition, the bird also promises the King that it would do his best to persuade Damayanthi to marry Nalan. Nalan is extremely pleased for the favour that came unasked. He hugs the bird as his dearest and sends it as his messenger to Damayanthi. Scene 4 ‚Äì Damayanthi and her companions Damayanthi, on hearing about the virtues of Nalan and tormented by the love god Kamadeva walks around in her garden along with her consorts. To her great surprise and happiness, Hamsam flies in like lightning descending on earth. When the bird comes closer, she asks the others to keep away and approaches the bird. The bird continues to move away slowly, luring Damayanthi further and further away. Once assured that they were beyond the reach of the others, Hamsam chides her, saying that though she was grown up enough, her childishness had not lessened, and she were seen trying to embrace the bird, she would be ridiculed. She needn't catch the bird, because it could be trusted. The bird also blessed her to get a King as her husband, who was an ardent lover and her desired sweetheart. The bird earns the trust of Damayanthi by revealing that it lived in the Kingdom of Nalan, tutoring ladies to practice proper gait. Damayanthi, in turn, persuades the Hamsam to describe the beauty and virtues of Nalan. Hearing her open aside about her desire to unite with Nalan, Hamsam encourages her to speak out what she had in her mind, treating it as a friend. It learns that she had been thrust deeply by the arrows of Kamadeva. Hamsam declares its intent ‚Äì that Nalan and Damayanthi are the best suited couple. She entreats the bird to carry her message to Nalan, so far kept a secret. To confirm her intention, the Hamsam uses a ploy ‚Äì it asks her what would happen if she were given away in marriage to somebody else and she bestow her love on him. It would be a deceit if her words turned false. Hamsam insists on getting a prompt answer and Damayanthi assures the bird that none other than Nalan can attract her love, as a river will ultimately fall only in the sea. No hill, even if it tried its best, can change the course of the river. Hamsam becomes happy and gets ready to leave, when Damayanthi pleads to describe how Nalan looks like. Hamsam draws his figure on a lotus leaf. Damayanthi embraces the picture with great relief and sees the bird off. She watches the bird flying away, with her mind full of love and gratification. Second Day: Nalcharitham Randam Divasam (Story line: Nalan marries Damayanthi, a disappointed Kali sees them dethroned and exiled, suffering and separation in the forest, Damayanthi rescued from a python by a hunter.) Overcoming many hindrances, Nalan marries Damayanthi and begins to live a happy life. Nalan expresses his affection to her in the Royal garden. Scene 1 ‚Äì Nalan and Damayanthi in the Royal garden Entranced in the beauty of the garden, Damayanthi describes the pleasant sights there ‚Äî the plants that denote the arrival of spring, flowers covered by beetles, sweet songs of birds and humming of beetles ‚Äî all appear to her as praise of Kama. Nalan tells her about the troubles he had to overcome to make her his own. They spend some time in the garden, immersed in pleasant exchanges. Scene 2 ‚Äì Entry of Kali and Dwaparan When the gods return to heaven after participating in the marriage of Nalan and Damayanthi, they happen to meet Kali, escorted by Dwaparan. On enquiries, Indran comes to know that Kali is on his way to marry Damayanthi, unaware that her marriage was over. Indran tells him that his attempt was like trying to build a dam when all the water had flowed out, because Damayanthi had already married a virtuous man named Nalan. When Kali comes to know that his desire was not to be fulfilled, he becomes angry and vows that he would not allow them to live together happily and he would do all that he could to separate them. The gods try to dissuade Kali from his attempt, and proceed to heaven. Scene 3 ‚Äì Scheming the plot: Kali and Dwaparan They together plot the scheme to separate Nalan and Damayanthi. Since Nalan was very righteous, Dwaparan tells Kali that he could be trapped only through deceit in playing Dice. They together decide to persuade Nalan‚Äôs younger brother Pushkaran to challenge Nalan for a game of Dice, in which Nalan could be defeated and sent into exile. Scene 4 ‚Äì Pushkaran, Kali and Dwaparan Pushkaran welcomes the unexpected visitors and describes his pathetic life where he had no royal powers. While enquiring about the purpose of their visit, he also exposes his inferiority complex. Extremely pleased with this congenial situation, they promise Pushkaran to help him defeat Nalan in a game of Dice, send him to the forest and make Pushkaran the King of the land. Kali offers himself as the stake for Pushkaran to start the game, and on being encouraged by the two, Pushkaran challenges Nalan for a game of Dice. Scene 5 ‚Äì Nalan, Pushkaran ‚Äì game of dice, defeat of Nalan Under Kali‚Äôs influence, Pushkaran abuses Nalan and challenges him for a game of dice. Nalan, with Damayanthi, comes out of the Palace and tries to dissuade him by scolds and threats. But Pushkaran insists on playing. After a long altercation between the two, Nalan finally sits down to play. With only an ox at stake for Pushkaran, Nalan confidently puts his country and all his wealth at stake, without any fear of being defeated. One by one, Nalan loses all his wealth and the situation comes to such a pass that if he contested again, he would lose his Kingdom and would have to go to the forest. Unruffled by the attempts of Damayanthi to dissuade him from this mad game, Nalan loses everything at stake and Pushkaran wins hands down. As if this were not enough, Pushkaran drives Nalan and Damayanthi out of the country with the worst of abuses. Having lost everything except the dress they were wearing and insulted to the core, Nalan and Damayanthi walk away grief-stricken, which Pushkaran enjoys best. Scene 6 ‚Äì Nalan and Damayanthi in the forest Helpless and frustrated, Nalan and Damayanthi wander in the forest, tortured by hunger and thirst. They happen to see two birds in front of them. Without knowing that they were the same Kali and Dwaparan disguised as birds, Nalan takes off his cloth to use as a net to catch the birds. Immediately, the birds fly away with his only piece of cloth, and Kali enters Nalan, which drives him crazy and senseless. The couple continues to wander aimlessly. Scene 7 ‚Äì Nalan and Damayanthi in the deep forest While wandering through a thick forest, they reach a shelter in the midnight, extremely tired. Fully aware that all their prosperity had vanished, Damayanthi tries to console Nalan. Nalan tries to persuade her to go back to the Palace. But she reminds him of her duty as a committed wife to accompany him wherever he was. Overcome by hunger and thirst, she rests her head on her husband‚Äôs lap and sleeps. Being under the influence of Kali, Nalan is distraught by the thoughts of going through the forest along with his wife without any protection and the dangers involved. He thinks that Damayanthi might be safe if she were left alone. Suffering from an unsound mind, he decides to leave Damayanthi to her fate. He lifts her head with trembling hands and lays it down on the floor. He covers his nakedness with one half of the dress torn from Damayanthi‚Äôs and leaves her in distress, after praying to all gods to look after her. Scene 8 ‚Äì Damayanthi Waking up from deep sleep and finding herself alone in the midst of a thick forest, Damayanthi is terrified by her loneliness and sorrow. When she doesn‚Äôt find Nalan near her, she calls for him to stop hiding and appear before her. She finally realises that she had been abandoned, he might perhaps be gone in search of some cloth to cover him up. She curses Kali, the being responsible for this fate of hers, and walks away through the forest. Scene 9 ‚Äì The Entry of the Hunter A hunter, sleeping in the forest, used only to the sounds of birds and animals, suddenly wakes up hearing human cries and sits up wondering from where it could be. He arms himself with weapons and walks towards the direction from which the sound originated. He realises that it is the sound of a beautiful woman crying for help. He enjoys her beauty from behind a tree and approaches her with wrong intentions. Scene 10 ‚Äì Damayanthi and the Hunter Damayanthi finds her leg caught within the jaws of a python. She is sure that she would die and prays to her husband to remember her kindly when he hears of her death. She then observes the Hunter approaching her with bad intentions. Unaware of the plight of Damayanthi, he entreats her to hold on to his shoulder when he sees the python attempting to swallow her. He takes up his bow and arrow, kills the python and saves her. Damayanthi thus saved, the hunter continues with his amorous pleas, but she tries to dissuade him. When he persists with his demand, she has no other go but to use the boon given by Indran ‚Äì that anyone attempting to molest her chastity will turn into ashes. She finds her saviour burning into ashes, thanks the god for making his boon true and continues to walk further along the forest in search of her husband. (Synopsis of the rest of the story: Damayanthi wanders in the forest, gets rescued by a group of merchants, finds refuge in Chedi Kingdom, is detected by the Brahmanan sent by her father on that errand and is taken to her kingdom where she joins her father Bhiman.) Third Day: Nalacharitham Moonnam Divasam (Story line: Nalan bitten by serpent, changes appearance, seeks shelter at Kosalam, hears about Damayanthi‚Äôs second marriage, frees himself from Kali by learning the secret manthra) Scene 1A ‚Äì Nalan alone Having deserted Damayanthi and finding himself alone, Nalan wails to all gods why he was destined to suffer such a fate. All the good things he had done, the boons bestowed on him by the gods and the daily worship he had offered to all the Gods are of no avail now, when he swerved a little from the path of righteousness. He consoles himself by the thought that all this was a turn of Destiny. His only desire was that Damayanthi should not suffer. He should not be termed a coward, for forsaking his wife. He repents and prays for a better turn of events. Scene 1B Nalan consoles himself through some philosophical ideas, arguing that the forest was a much better place than the city to live in. The beings in the city are cruel both inside and outside; in the forest, there are pleasant rivers, beautiful trees and small huts, which give greater happiness than the gruelling emotions of the outer world. Immersed in such comforting thoughts, he feels that Fate was growing more kind towards him. Scene 2 ‚Äì Nalan and Karkotakan Involved in such confused thoughts and moving around aimlessly, Nalan hears someone calling him, crying to be rescued, from the midst of a wild fire. Since he had received the boon that fire could not burn either him or those who touch him, Nalan runs into the fire and saves the serpent that was trapped in the fire. When rescued, the serpent wants Nalan to count from one to ten. When he reaches ten, the serpent bites him and makes him unrecognisable. Flustered with anger and sorrow, Nalan asks the serpent why it did so to its saviour. The serpent reveals itself as Karkotakan, a great one among the most venomous, who was cursed by a Sage and given the reprieve that Nalan would rescue it. Karkotakan also tells him that the venom was injected into him to drive away Kali that had infested him and he would soon join Damayanthi. Nalan is gifted with a holy piece of cloth, wearing which he would return to his original appearance. He is advised to stay incognito as Bahukan in the kingdom of Kosalam, serving King Rithuparnan. When he acquires the Akshahrudaya Manthra from the King, Kali would jump out of his body and thus, Nalan would be completely relieved of all worries and join Damayanthi. Karkotakan blesses him to enjoy all prosperity and Nalan walks towards the Kingdom of Rithuparna. Scene 3A ‚Äì Kingdom of Kosalam ‚Äì King Rithuparna, Jeevalan, Varshneyan and Bahukan As directed by Karkotakan, Bahukan requests the King for a chance to serve him. The King allows him to stay there with the other two servants as a cook and chariot- driver. Scene 3B ‚Äì Bahukan‚Äôs house ‚Äì Bahukan, Jeevalan and Varshneyan While living in Kosalam in all comforts, one day when the other two servants were deep asleep, Bahukan is worried about what might have happened to his beloved. He finds consolation in the thought that the couple had been profusely blessed by gods and nothing untoward could happen. When Jeevalan overhears his wailings, he is inquisitive, but Bahukan answers that it was only a sad song that he had created. Bahukan evades continued questionings and does not reveal his real identity. (In the meantime, after reaching her father‚Äôs court, Damayathi had sent around Brahmins in search of Nalan all around the country. Of these, one named Parnadan happened to bring the news that a person befitting her clues was there in the court of Rithuparna, living in the name of Bahukan. Damayanthi consults her mother and decides on the future course of action.) Scene 4 ‚Äì Sudevan, Damayanthi Following the cue from Parnadan, Damayanthi concludes that her dear was living in hiding in Kosalam. She asks a trustworthy Brahmin named Sudevan to reach Kosalam and do his best to enable her re-union with her husband. He promises to undergo any risk to bring them together. The King of Kosalam was well known to him and he would declare in the presence of Nalan (Bahukan) that Damayanthi‚Äôs second marriage was planned for the next day, and the King was invited to take part. Assuring Damayanthi of all success, he starts on his trip towards Kosalam. Scene 5A ‚Äì Rithuparnan, Bahukan, Jeevalan, Varshneyan, Sudevan Sudevan informs Rithuparnan, in the presence of Bahukan, about the second marriage of Damayanthi taking place the next day. On hearing this, Bahukan is shocked and upset, but he doesn‚Äôt show it. The lecherous Rithuparna immediately orders Bahukan to take him as fast as possible to Kundinapuri. Scene 5B ‚Äì Bahukan‚Äôs aside The thought of the second marriage of Damayanthi appears to Bahukan as poison itself. He is further upset because he was chosen to drive the chariot. He is worried about the turn of events, but has a faint hope that she would not marry again. The King arrives there in the chariot along with Varshneyan and the three together proceed towards Kundinapuram. Both Rithuparna and Varshneya are surprised at the speed with which Bahukan drives the Chariot. The King‚Äôs upper cloth falls down and he asks Bahukan to slow down. Bahukan asks him whether the piece of cloth or attending the marriage was important. Extremely pleased with the character of Bahukan, Rithuparna show him the trick of counting the number of leaves on a tree beside the path. Bahukan insists on learning it and the King teaches him that manthra (Akshahrudaya Manthra, which has the power of driving away Kali from his body). Fourth Day: Nalacharitham Naalam Divasam When Rithuparnan escorted by Bahukan arrives at the Court of King Bhiman, quite contrary to his expectation of seeing the court crowded with Kings, he finds himself alone. Bahukan, though much agitated, maintains a calm demeanor. There were no signs of any preparations for marriage. Rithuparna decides to cover up his foolishness by pretending that he had come only to refresh his friendship with King Bhiman. Within the Queen‚Äôs chamber, Damayanthi concludes that the King could have reached there so fast only because Nalan had driven the chariot. Rithuparnan is welcomed in the Court by the King and he is hosted in the Guest house. (Story line: Damayanthi identifies Bahukan as Nalan with the help of Kesini; he regains his beauty, resolve misunder-standings, and unite again.) Scene 1 ‚Äì Damayanthi and Kesini in the Queen‚Äôs apartment Eager to see the most handsome face of her husband Nalan, Damayanthi sends her companion Kesini to watch the ugly figure that has come with Rithuparnan, with instructions to observe his manner of eating and sleeping. Scene 2 ‚Äì Guest house ‚Äì Bahukan, Kesini Kesini approaches Bahukan and asks him who he was and why he had come there. Though it was evident to Nalan that the marriage of Damayanthi was false information, Bahukan tells her the truth that they had come for the second marriage of Damayanthi. She tells him that, being separated from Nalan, Damayanthi had lost all interest in life and enquires whether he had any news about Nalan. Bahukan is a bit shaken, but tells her he never heard of Nalan and had no idea whether he was hiding somewhere or not. Once the second marriage had been fixed, she had no reason to think of Nalan and women of high origin should not be angry with their husbands whatever wrong they had done. Kesini‚Äôs doubts increased when she heard the details of the conversation with Parnadan. Bahukan sends her away because it was not proper for strangers to be seen together at untimely hours. But, Kesini hides herself there and keenly observes Bahukan, who by the powers of his boons cooks without using fire, turns dry flowers fresh with his touch, and many other strange acts of his. She goes back to Damayanthi convinced that she had discovered something important. Scene 3 ‚Äì Damayanthi, Kesini Kesini describes to Damayanthi what she observed about Bahukan. Damayanthi feels assured that Bahukan is Nalan himself, but wonders about the change in his appearance and is confused about the next step. She thinks that her husband was not angry with her and yet even if it ended up in her death, which would be better than this pain of separation, she decides to meet him and pay a wife‚Äôs obeisance. Scene 4 ‚Äì Bahukan, Damayanthi With the permission of her mother, Damayanthi goes to Bahukan. Though tense on seeing his beloved after long, he controls his emotions and becomes repentant. She asks him quite touchingly whether he had seen her loved one anywhere. Nalan is exhilarated at this meeting and doesn‚Äôt bother to listen to her tearful words. She was sure that the height, behaviour and actions of Bahukan were exactly that of Nalan, but wonders where his beautiful looks had gone. He, in the meanwhile, wears the holy cloth gifted by Karkotakan and regains his original shape. But instead of being pleased, he abuses Damayanthi more and more. Damayanthi approaches him with surprise and happiness, but Nalan drives her away, asking her to go ahead with the second marriage as planned and live with some king that she liked. Completely shattered by the abuses of Nalan, Damayanthi explains that the news of the second marriage was only a ploy to regain Nalan, as advised by her mother. Refusing to believe anything of what she says, Nalan turns away from Damayanthi, when he hears a voice from nowhere: ‚ÄúI am Vayudeva telling you that the idea of a second marriage was only a trick employed by her to bring Nalan back to her and there was no reason to doubt her!‚Äù This is followed by requests from the gods in heaven, shower of flowers from all around and sacred sounds of musical instruments. Nalan embraces her lovingly with a breaking heart in such a holy atmosphere and consoles her. Then they exchange their experiences during the period of separation and proceed towards the King‚Äôs Palace.

RNS employs a network of correspondents providing news and information on all faiths and religious movements to newspapers, magazines, broadcast organizations and religious publications. It also features commentary by Richard Mouw, Thomas J. Reese, Jana Riess, Mark Silk and other columnists, and offers a press release distribution service. RNS wire reports are distributed to secular and faith-based news outlets alike, including The Washington Post, USA Today, Christian Century and Sojourners. History Religion News Service was founded in 1934 by journalist Louis Minsky as an independent, nonprofit affiliate of National Conference of Christians and Jews. It is a secular news agency that does not endorse or promote any particular creed, faith or tradition. The United Methodist Reporter bought RNS in 1983, and in 1994, Newhouse News Service, a major publisher of daily newspapers and magazines, purchased it and changed its name to Religion News Service. In 2011, RNS was sold to the Religion Newswriters Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of the Religion Newswriters Association. RNS is owned by Religion News LLC, a nonprofit, limited-liability corporation led by CEO and publisher Thomas Gallagher, and based at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. RNS is governed by a Board of Managers, including Jerry Pattengale, in partnership with Religion News Foundation. Controversy In April 2015, the Catholic News Agency (CNA) published an article disclosing that RNS had received a grant of $120,000 from the Arcus Foundation, an LGBT‚Äìrights advocacy organization, with the stated intent ‚Äúto recruit and equip LGBT supportive leaders and advocates to counter rejection and antagonism within traditionally conservative Christian churches.‚Äù The CNA story questioned whether the grant had biased RNS's coverage of traditional religion, specifically citing an RNS article on Cardinal Raymond Burke. In response to the CNA report, RNS's then editor-in- chief Kevin Eckstrom denied that the Arcus grant had any influence over editorial decisions at RNS and noted that the grant language is ‚ÄúArcus‚Äô description of their funding, not ours.‚Äù The grant proposal to the Arcus Foundation had stressed only the need to ‚Äúincrease and improve domestic and international coverage of how religion affects a diverse range of LGBT communities.‚Äù References External links * Category:1934 establishments in the United States Category:Religious organizations established in 1934 Category:News agencies based in the United States Category:Religious mass media in the United States ","title":"Religion News Service"},{"id":"24698461","text":"Janhova () is a small dispersed settlement in the Municipality of Apaƒçe in northeastern Slovenia.Apaƒçe municipal site  References   External links  *Janhova on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Apaƒçe ","title":"Janhova"},{"id":"24698462","title":"List of mosques in Brunei"},{"id":"24698469","text":"Ivan Zelic (born 24 February 1978) is an Australian former international footballer and current writer, film-maker, actor and model. Club career Ivan Zelic was born to Croatian parents, and began to play football (Soccer) at the age of 7 for club side Canberra FC, a club known as a breeding ground for Australian Croatian footballing talent, with the likes of older brother, Australian international Ned Zelic, and Croatian international Josip Simunic also coming through the same ranks. He won a scholarship at the illustrious Australian Institute of Sport (A.I.S) at the age of 16. Known for his cultured left foot, it was here that Zelic was picked out by Sydney Olympic in the National Soccer League (NSL), where he began to ply his trade in the professional league at the age of 17, cementing a spot as a defender in David Ratcliffe's side of 1995‚Äì96. After two seasons, he then signed for Canberra Cosmos, and due to his outstanding leadership qualities, in his second year there was to become the National Soccer League's youngest ever captain at the age of 21. With a below par squad recruited by coach Rale Rasic though, the team lacked the ingredients to be seriously competitive, Rasic eventually sacked towards the end of the season as the team struggled to elevate itself from the foot of the table. He then signed for Adelaide City on a two-year deal with mixed results after succumbing to injury, and infuriating coach Zoran Matic by becoming involved with modeling, which led to him missing a training session to shoot a campaign in 2000. Halfway through the second season in Adelaide, Zelic departed for Melbourne Knights. After finishing the season, Zelic returned home to play for Canberra FC, being a stand out for the local side as a left sided midfielder as they won the minor premiership, and finally enjoying his football again. It was at his next NSL side, Sydney United, that Zelic suffered a horrific injury, a Lisfranc fracture, which involved breaking two metatarsals and tearing the ligaments in his right foot whilst playing in Auckland against the Auckland Kingz in the NSL. He was to eventually recover, and after a 9-month lay off through injury, signed for Malaysian club Johor FC, where he spent a season. Upon returning to Australia, he signed for NSW premier league sides St. George Saints and Blacktown City Demons, and was in possibly the best form of his career, leading the Demons to a minor premiership playing as an attacking left sided midfielder. With the emergence of the professional A-League on the horizon and his interests outside of football such as writing and acting becoming more prominent, he decided to retire at the age of 28, much to the dismay of coach Aytec Genc, who stated: 'Ivan was a wonderful footballer. I don't know too many guys that are 28 years old, 6-foot-3 and have the technical ability that he has; It's a shame to lose him at what I consider, to be the peak of his talent.' International career Zelic was a regular of the Australian Under 20s, or Young Socceroos, starting 11 in the lead up to, and in the World Youth Cup, which was held in Malaysia in 1997. Played out of position at left back though, he struggled to make an impact. After the World Youth Cup was over, he furthered his international career by becoming the captain of the Australian Olympic team or Olyroos in their lead up to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, but known for his lack of interest in the game due to interests outside of football, he was to eventually fall out of favor with Australian Olympic team coach Raul Blanco. Blanco eventually invited Zelic to be part of the Olympic squad for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, but true to form and uninterested in international football, Zelic declined the offer in a storm of controversy, instead opting to concentrate on his club football with Adelaide City, where he fell out with coach Zoran Matic a few months later. Acting career In 2005, Zelic was sent to an audition by his modelling agency after they decided that he should give acting a go due to his animated nature. He went along and thrilled the casting agents at Maura Faye with his natural talent, and was recalled from the audition and flown to the US to screen test for Passions, a US soap. He didn't get the role, but was fascinated by acting and decided to complement his natural ability by receiving training, subsequently graduating from Screenwise in Sydney, before furthering his studies at The Oncamera Studios, as well as studying under Anthony Brandon Wong on the Ivana Chubbuck technique. He began to write and star in numerous short films which were directed by the accomplished Simon Watts. Since then, Zelic has gone on to star in hit Australian shows such as All Saints, Home and Away and Packed to the Rafters. He most recently shot a role on the channel 10 telemovie A Model Daughter: The Murder of Caroline Byrne. In 2011, Zelic took the stage name Ivan Ford, although having previously toyed with the alias \\"Ivan Hudson\\", to further remove himself from his and his brother's past footballing career, and as a homage to one of his favourite actors, Harrison Ford. Directing career In 2008, Zelic wrote and directed his first short film, The Sin Bleeder, with accomplished cinematographer Marc Windon. Zelic's style in The Sin Bleeder became known for its long takes and smooth camera movements, the short film eventually going on to play at numerous short film festivals, as well as appearing at the Bondi Short Film Festival. His follow-up, Ruthless Days, a gritty crime story, was shot in late 2008, and also went on to appear at several short film festivals across Australia, one of them being the Melbourne Underground Film Festival. Personal life Zelic is the younger brother of former Australian international footballer Ned Zeliƒá and the older brother of Thursday FC presenter Lucy Zelic.

It is found mainly in South and Central America, from Mexico to Bolivia, and Ecuador to south-eastern Brazil. It was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1779. It is the only known Neotropical arsenurinae to exhibit a combination of strong aposematism, gregariousness, and trail-following behavior in its larval stage. The larvae are brightly colored, with bright black and yellow bands, which signal their unpleasant taste to birds. The larvae are also fatally poisonous to some species of birds. During the day, the larvae rest in large conspicuous masses on the trunks of trees, and descend at night to feed. When returning at dawn, they follow a silk-less pheromone trail to their original central place location. This social behavior is remarkable for the larvae; other members of the genus live more solitary lives. The larvae feed on Guazuma ulmifolia, Rollinia membranacea and Bombacopsis quinatum. After the larva's fourth instar, it will descend from the larval mass, excavate a small chamber in the soil and pupate. Then, shortly after the rainy season in June, the pupa will eclose (emerge). The adult form of the species are large brown moths which possess a wingspan of 100‚Äì120 mm. The adults will mate the same night they emerge, and afterwards the females will lay their eggs in large batches on the underside tree leaves. To the indigenous people of the Zongolica area of Veracruz, the larvae are also a form of sustenance; they are gathered and eaten after being cooked.  Taxonomy and naming  Arsenura armida is also known as the giant silk moth. It belongs to the subfamily Arsenurinae, consisting of approximately 57 species of Neotropical saturniids found from tropical Mexico to northern Argentina.  Morphology and identification  The young larvae exhibit aposematism through their bright yellow and black-ringed bodies and red heads. The later instars are darker and \\"duskier\\" than early instars. They possess a dark brown head, a soma covered with fine short setae, and black tentacle-like protuberances on the dorsum of the thoracic segments. The intersegmental membrane is colored with thin orange-yellow rings. The adults are large brown moths that like to rest with spread wings. They are predominantly dull colored, though some may display complex patterns. The adult wingspan is 100‚Äì120 mm.  Distribution and habitat  The giant silk moth occurs mainly in Central and Southern America, from tropical Mexico to southeastern Brazil. They can be found on Guazuma ulmifolia, Rollinia membranacea, and Bombacopsis quinatum plants. They are also found in Costa Rica in all wildland ecosystems from dry forest to very wet rain-forest.  Life cycle and behavior  Giant silk moth caterpillars are noted for their gregariousness in all phases of larval development. A peculiar phenomenon is the shift in different forms of social behavior from early to late instars. In early instars, the larvae aggregate at all times in different patches and engage in nomadic foraging. As they age, these moths display a shift to a central foraging location so that larvae feed solitarily at night but, when done feeding, ascend to the canopy at roughly the same time to rest diurnally. Hypotheses have been made to try and explain this shift in behavior. In general, caterpillar feeding behavior is shaped by the joint effects of phylogenetic history, larval nutritional ecology, size or appearance, and defensive ecology. Such behavior shifts can be found in other species. For instance, the larvae of many swallowtails begin as cryptic mimics of bird droppings but then switch to aposematism or aggressive mimicry in later instars. Predation and/or parasitism is hypothesized to have played a role in the grouping behavior and aposematism of the giant silk moth. It is known that the late instar larvae are lethally poisonous to predators such as trogon nestlings, among others, when swallowed. The bright colors, augmented by the large number of caterpillars in a larval mass, are a visible deterrent to any would-be predators.  Early instars ‚Äì first to third  The larvae hatch from large egg masses laid on the underside of leaves. Unlike their close relatives, the first-instar larvae are neither cryptic nor solitary. They hatch in groups, and feed together, side-by-side on leaves. They employ a nomadic foraging technique, moving together when resources are exhausted. During the nomadic foraging phase, the caterpillars utilize a pheromone trail to promote group cohesion, as well as mark trails between feeding sites. In the fourth instar and onwards, the pheromone trail is mainly used as a marker to convey information for relocation to the central place site.  Late instars ‚Äì fourth to prepupation  By the fourth instar the larvae begin to rest diurnally in large conspicuous masses on the lower trunk of larger branches. They adopt a new feeding behavior, called central place foraging. In this behavior, caterpillars rest during the day in large visible groups, then mobilize at dusk to forage nocturnally as solitary larvae in the canopy. At dawn, they return to the original central place using pheromone trails. To date, giant silk moth larvae are one of the few social Lepidoptera known where silk is not produced at all when foraging. The trails they follow are all pheromone based. The pheromones are deposited by caterpillars as they move to distant feed sites. These trails facilitate the re-aggregation of the group at the new feeding location and help prevent separation. At dawn, caterpillars will follow a pheromone trail to the original central place site to form bivouacs. Studies have shown that larval trail following can be elicited by wiping cuticular material collected from the venter and dorsum of the abdomen of giant silk moth caterpillars onto the host plant. Crude extracts of homogenated somatic tissue can also elicit the same response. The trail marker is hypothesized to be a component of the cuticle that is passively deposited from the posterior-ventral region of the abdomen as larvae move over the host plant. Tree architecture also plays a role in re-aggregation. Trees with a single trunk funnel aggregate returning caterpillars more quickly and more densely than those with multiple trunks. The same bivouac can be used by a particular group of caterpillars, though research has found that individual caterpillars do not exhibit strict site fidelity. An individual caterpillar may sometime shift sites when descended of the tree, depending on which pheromone trails it decides to follow on its return journey to a central site. Larvae continue this central place foraging behavior until they leave the tree as prepupates to solitarily excavate a pupation chamber in the soil, where they pupate.  Eclosion and adult life  Eclosion occurs in June, shortly after the beginning of the rainy season. The pupae eclose after spending a long dry season as solitary and dormant pupae 2‚Äì10 cm below the soil surface. In captivity, both sexes eclose about an hour after dark and mating takes place on the same night pupation occurs. The following night, females look for a suitable food plant like Guazuma ulmifolia, where they will lay their entire egg load in one mass on the underside of a leaf. Occasionally females will split the clutch into two roughly equal-sized masses, both of which may be laid on the same night or over two nights. The average egg mass contains about 300 to 400 eggs. Females live for 6 to 8 days after eclosion, just like other related saturniids. The giant silk moth differs drastically from its close relatives in terms of ovipositioning behavior. Female moths lay all of their eggs in a large cluster on the underside of a leaf, whereas females from other species of Arsenurinae lay one or two eggs at a time and at different individual trees. The caterpillars of other arsenurites are cryptic and not social, and will hence benefit more from being laid in single batches. The eggs will hatch after 12 to 14 days.  Interactions with humans  The giant silk moth is edible in its larval stage and is consumed by some indigenous peoples of Mexico. This practice is called entomophagy. The Ixcohuapa community of the Zongolica area of Veracruz, Mexico are known to gather and consume the early instar larvae. Larvae can be cooked and then eaten as an alternative source of protein. People are also known to preserve the larvae in a vinegar solution that gives them the taste of herring. Larvae are usually sold in the streets either in ambulant markets or by independent street vendors. There exist no laws to regulate the collection and commercialization of these organisms, which are consumed in enormous quantities and could be in risk of extinction.

The main characters in myths are usually gods, demigods, or supernatural humans.Simpson, Jacqueline, and Steve Roud, eds. 2003. \\"Myths.\\" In A Dictionary of English Folklore. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Stories of everyday human beings, although often of leaders of some type, are usually contained in legends, as opposed to myths. Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests or priestesses and are closely linked to religion or spirituality. Many societies group their myths, legends, and history together, considering myths and legends to be true accounts of their remote past. In particular, creation myths take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form. Other myths explain how a society's customs, institutions, and taboos were established and sanctified. There is a complex relationship between recital of myths and the enactment of rituals. The term mythology may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The study of myth began in ancient history. Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato, and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including folklore studies, philology, psychology, and anthropology. Moreover, the academic comparisons of bodies of myth are known as comparative mythology. Since the term myth is widely used to imply that a story is not objectively true, the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as true and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of Jewish mythology, Christian mythology, Islamic mythology, Hindu mythology, and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the Abrahamic religions as being the province of theology rather than mythology. Meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in Hinduism, as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of Christianity. Labelling all religious narratives as myths can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity. Definitions Arthurian mythology Myth Definitions of myth vary to some extent among scholars, though Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko offers a widely-cited definition: Scholars in other fields use the term myth in varied ways. In a broad sense, the word can refer to any traditional story, popular misconception or imaginary entity. However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as legend and folktale in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives. Some kinds of folktales, such as fairy stories, are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason. Main characters in myths are usually gods, demigods or supernatural humans, while legends generally feature humans as their main characters. However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the Iliad, Odyssey and Aeneid. Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as giants, elves and faeries. Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the Matter of Britain (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table) and the Matter of France, seem distantly to originate in historical events of the 5th and 8th-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries. In colloquial use, the word myth can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.\\"Myth.\\" Lexico. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2020.

This usage, which is often pejorative, arose from labelling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.Eliade, Mircea. 1967. Myths, Dreams and Mysteries. pp. 23, 162. However, as commonly used by folklorists and academics in other relevant fields, such as anthropology, the term myth has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.Winzeler, Robert L. 2012.

Mythology In present use, mythology usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people, but may also mean the study of such myths. For example, Greek mythology, Roman mythology, and Hittite mythology all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures. Folklorist Alan Dundes defines myth as a sacred narrative that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form.

Etymology Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song, by Francesco Hayez, 1813‚Äì15 The word myth comes from Ancient Greek Œº·ø¶Œ∏ŒøœÇ (m»≥thos), meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early 19th century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for \\"[a] traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events.\\" In turn, Ancient Greek (mytholog√≠a, 'story,' 'lore,' 'legends,' or 'the telling of stories') combines the word m»≥thos with the suffix -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± (-logia, 'study') in order to mean 'romance, fiction, story-telling.'\\"-logy, comb. form.\\" In Oxford English Dictionary (). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1903. Accordingly, Plato used mytholog√≠a as a general term for 'fiction' or 'story-telling' of any kind. The Greek term mytholog√≠a was then borrowed into Late Latin, occurring in the title of Latin author Fulgentius' 5th-century Mythologi√¶ to denote what we now call classical mythology‚Äîi.e., Greco-Roman etiological stories involving their gods. Fulgentius' Mythologi√¶ explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events. The Latin term was then adopted in Middle French as mythologie. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word mythology in the 15th century, initially meaning 'the exposition of a myth or myths,' 'the interpretation of fables,' or 'a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in John Lydgate's Troy Book (c. 1425).\\"mythology, n..\\" Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2003. Accessed 20 Aug 2014.Harper, Douglas. 2020. \\"Mythology.\\" Online Etymology Dictionary. From Lydgate until the 17th or 18th century, mythology was used to mean a moral, fable, allegory or a parable, or collection of traditional stories, understood to be false. It came eventually to be applied to similar bodies of traditional stories among other polytheistic cultures around the world. Thus the word mythology entered the English language before the word myth. Johnson's Dictionary, for example, has an entry for mythology, but not for myth. Indeed, the Greek loanword mythos (pl. mythoi) and Latinate mythus (pl. mythi) both appeared in English before the first example of myth in 1830. Meanings in Ancient Greece The term Œº·ø¶Œ∏ŒøœÇ (m»≥thos) appears in the works of Homer and other poets of Homer's era, in which the term had several meanings: 'conversation,' 'narrative,' 'speech,' 'story,' 'tale,' and 'word.'Anderson (2004), p. 61 Similar to the related term ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ (logos), mythos expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words. These can be contrasted with Greek ·ºîœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ (ergon, 'action,' 'deed,' or 'work'). However, the term mythos lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives. In the context of Ancient Greek theatre, mythos referred to the myth, narrative, plot, and the story of a play.Wiles (2000), pp. 5‚Äì6 According to David Wiles, the Greek term mythos in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance. According to philosopher Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its mythos. The term mythos was also used for the source material of Greek tragedy. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from Greek mythology, a body of \\"traditional storylines\\" which concerned gods and heroes. David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the mythos behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when adapting them for the stage. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions. Storytellers like Euripides (c. 480‚Äì406 BCE) relied on suspense to excite their audiences. In one of his works, Merope attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit filicide or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar. David Wiles points that the traditional mythos of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its oral tradition. The Greeks of this era were a literate culture but produced no sacred texts. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.Wiles (2000), p. 12 Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation. Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher Plato (c. 428‚Äì347 BCE), mothers and nursemaids narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore. Bruce Lincoln has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms mythos and logos in the works of Hesiod. In Theogony, Hesiod attributes to the Muses the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (i.e., falsehoods which seem like real things).Lincoln (1999), pp. 3‚Äì5 The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is legein, which is etymologically associated with logos. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses gerusasthai, the other mythesasthai. The latter is a form of the verb mytheomai ('to speak,' 'to tell'), which is etymologically associated with mythos. In the Works and Days, Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is mythesaimen, another form of mytheomai. Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the \\"speech of mythos\\" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the truth. While he associated the \\"speech of logos\\" with telling lies, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation). This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term logoi (the plural form of logos) elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term seductive and three times with the term falsehoods. In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists logoi among the children of Eris, the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict. Interpreting myths Comparative mythology Comparative mythology is a systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common \\"protomythology\\" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture. Functionalism A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. Eliade argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine. Honko asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present. Similarly, Barthes argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present. Pattanaik defines mythology as \\"the subjective truth of people communicated through stories, symbols and rituals.\\" He says, \\"Facts are everybody's truth. Fiction is nobody's truth. Myths are somebody's truth.\\" Euhemerism One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events. According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods. For example, the myth of the wind-god Aeolus may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds. Herodotus (fifth-century BCE) and Prodicus made claims of this kind. This theory is named euhemerism after mythologist Euhemerus (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.\\"Euhemerism.\\" The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. Allegory Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: Apollo represents the sun, Poseidon represents water, and so on. According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: Athena represents wise judgment, Aphrodite desire, and so on. M√ºller supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as \\"raging\\" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god. Personification Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the personification of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them. For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects. Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths. Myth-ritual theory According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual. In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals. This claim was first put forward by Smith, who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth. Frazer argued that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods. History of the academic discipline Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of Vico, Schelling, Schiller, Jung, Freud, L√©vy-Bruhl, L√©vi- Strauss, Frye, the Soviet school, and the Myth and Ritual School.Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii. Ancient Greece Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) The critical interpretation of myth began with the Presocratics. Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events, though distorted over many retellings. Sallustius divided myths into five categories:\\"On the Gods and the World.\\" ch. 5; See: Collected Writings on the Gods and the World. Frome: The Prometheus Trust. 1995. * theological; * physical (or concerning natural law); * animistic (or concerning soul); * material; and * mixed, which concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations. Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the Republic. His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As Platonism developed in the phases commonly called Middle Platonism and neoplatonism, writers such as Plutarch, Porphyry, Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus‚Äô Commentary on the Republic (to be found in The Works of Plato I, trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry‚Äôs analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (Select Works of Porphyry, Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation. Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with Homer. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths (Cupid and Psyche). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. Euhemerism, as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of pagan mythology following Christianization). European Renaissance This panel by Bartolomeo di Giovanni relates the second half of the Metamorphoses. In the upper left, Jupiter emerges from clouds to order Mercury to rescue Io.For more information on this panel, please see Zeri catalogue number 64, pp. 100‚Äì101 Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the Renaissance, with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the Theologia Mythologica (1532). Nineteenth century The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the 19th century‚Äîat the same time as the word myth was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages. They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and vernacular culture, associated with Romantic Nationalism and epitomised by the research of Jacob Grimm (1785‚Äì1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with Norse mythology, Finnish mythology, and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through colonialism. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the Sanskrit Rigveda and the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, and current oral narratives such as mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas or stories told in traditional African religions.Shippey, Tom. 2005. \\"A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century.\\" Pp. 1‚Äì28 in The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm‚Äôs Mythology of the Monstrous, edited by T. Shippey. Tempe, AZ: Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. pp. 4‚Äì13. The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about evolution. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages‚Äîand therefore, conceivably, stories‚Äîwere all descended from a lost common ancestor (the Indo-European language) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that cultures might evolve in ways comparable to species. In general, 19th-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a unilineal framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.  Nature mythology  One of the dominant mythological theories of the latter 19th century was nature mythology, the foremost exponents of which included Max M√ºller and Edward Burnett Tylor. This theory posited that \\"primitive man\\" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful to European Victorians‚Äîsuch as tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism‚Äîas being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.McKinnell, John. 2005. Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend. Cambridge: Brewer. pp. 14-15. Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, thus giving rise to animism. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas. M√ºller also saw myth as originating from language, even calling myth a \\"disease of language.\\" He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods. Not all scholars, not even all 19th-century scholars, accepted this view, however: Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl claimed that \\"the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind and not a stage in its historical development.\\" Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for \\"nature mythology\\" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of \\"nature mythology.\\"Dorson, Richard M. 1955. \\"The Eclipse of Solar Mythology.\\" Pp. 25‚Äì63 in Myth: A Symposium, edited by T. A. Sebeok. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.  Myth and ritual  James George Frazer saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law. this idea was central to the \\"myth and ritual\\" school of thought. According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally, humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress \\"from magic through religion to science.\\" Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth. Twentieth century Prometheus (1868) by Gustave Moreau. In the mythos of Hesiodus and possibly Aeschylus (the Greek trilogy Prometheus Bound, Prometheus Unbound and Prometheus Pyrphoros), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity. The earlier 20th century saw major work developing psychoanalytical approaches to interpreting myth, led by Sigmund Freud, who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the Oedipus complex in his 1899 The Interpretation of Dreams. Jung likewise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called archetypes. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.Boeree. The mid-20th century saw the influential development of a structuralist theory of mythology, led by L√©vi- Strauss. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges. Meanwhile, Bronislaw Malinowski developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as origin stories might provide a \\"mythic charter\\"‚Äîa legitimisation‚Äîfor cultural norms and social institutions.Birenbaum, Harvey. 1988. Myth and Mind. Lanham, MD: University Press of America. pp. 152‚Äì53. Thus, following the Structuralist Era (c. 1960s‚Äì1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted, and analyzed like ideology, history, and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that are connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches, such as those of Joseph Campbell and Eliade, which hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite. In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book Mythologies, which stood as an early work in the emerging post-structuralist approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in popular culture. The 20th century saw rapid secularisation in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the Abrahamic religions as myths; theologians such as Rudolf Bultmann argued that a modern Christianity needed to demythologize;Bultmann, Rudolf. 1958. Jesus Christ and Mythology. New York: Scribner. and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance. This, in his appendix to Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, and in The Myth of the Eternal Return, Eliade attributed modern humans‚Äô anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred. The Christian theologian Conrad Hyers wrote: Twenty-first century Both in 19th-century research, which tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in 20th-century structuralist work, which sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late 20th century, however, researchers influenced by postmodernism tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.For example: McKinnell, John. 1994. Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism, (Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni 1, edited by T. P√†roli). Rome. There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was A. K. Ramanujan's essay \\"Three Hundred Ramayanas\\".Ramanujan, A. K. 1991. \\"Three Hundred RƒÅmƒÅya·πáas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation.\\" Pp. 22‚Äì48 in Many RƒÅmƒÅya·πáas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia, edited by P. Richman. Berkeley: University of California Press. ark:13030/ft3j49n8h7/Ramanujan, A. K. [1991] 2004. \\"Three Hundred RƒÅmƒÅya·πáas.\\" Pp. 131‚Äì60 in The Collected Essays of A. K. Ramanujan. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.For example: Dowden, Ken. 1992. The Uses of Greek Mythology. London: Routledge. Modern mythology Belgian banknote, depicting Ceres, Neptune and caduceus In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of cultural studies research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in television, cinema and video games. Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film. In Jungian psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society‚Äôs goals, fears, ambitions and dreams. The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. The Walt Disney Company is well-known among cultural study scholars for \\"reinventing\\" traditional childhood myths. While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of cyberpunk action films, fantasy, dramas and apocalyptic tales. 21st-century films such as Clash of the Titans, Immortals and Thor continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as Rick Riordan, whose Percy Jackson and the Olympians series is situated in a modern-day world where the Greek deities are manifest.

Hugh Percy (29 January 1784 ‚Äì 5 February 1856) was an Anglican bishop who served as Bishop of Rochester (1827) and Bishop of Carlisle (1827‚Äì56). Life Percy was born in London, the third son of Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley by his wife, Isabella Susannah Burrell, second daughter of Peter Burrell and sister of Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr. His mother was sister of Frances Julia Burrell, who married Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland, and of Elizabeth Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton. Percy was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1805 and Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1825; he was admitted DD ad eundem at Oxford University in 1834.The Dictionary of National Biography erroneously states he was at Trinity College, Cambridge. Having taken holy orders, Percy married, on 19 May 1806, Mary, the eldest daughter of Charles Manners-Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury, by whom in 1809 he was collated to the benefices of Bishopsbourne and Ivychurch, Kent. In 1810 he was appointed chancellor and a prebendary of Exeter, appointments he held until 1816. On 21 December 1812 he was installed as Canon Chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1816 he was collated by his father-in-law to a prebendal stall at Canterbury Cathedral and in the same year he received the stall of Finsbury at St Paul's Cathedral, which he held until his death. In 1822 he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1825, on the death of Gerrard Andrewes, he was promoted as Dean of Canterbury Cathedral. While Dean of Canterbury he set in motion the repair of the interior of the cathedral. Two years later (15 July 1827), on the death of Walker King, he was consecrated Bishop of Rochester; after a few months' tenure, he was translated, on the death of Samuel Goodenough, to Carlisle. This bishopric he held till his death. In 1838 Percy established a clergy aid society, and in 1855 a diocesan education society. He found Rose Castle, the episcopal residence, much dilapidated; he called in the architect Thomas Rickman, and the house was entirely remodelled. The main cost was defrayed out of the episcopal revenues, but he spent his own money on the gardens, grounds, and outbuildings. A rosary was laid out by Sir Joseph Paxton, who also formed the terraced gardens. He was fond of farming, and on his journeys to and from London, to attend the House of Lords, he used to drive his four horses himself. He died at Rose Castle and was buried in the parish churchyard of Dalston. Family Percy's first wife, Mary Manners-Sutton, by whom he had three sons and eight daughters, died in September 1831. Among their children were: *Algernon Charles (29 Jun 1812-24 Jan 1901). served as a Major in the Shropshire Yeomanry and married Emily, daughter of Bishop Reginald Heber; she was heiress to her uncle, Richard Heber MP and, in 1847, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Heber, becoming Algernon Heber-Percy, after inheriting her family's estates at Hodnet and Airmyn.Burke's Peerage 2003, page 2943 They had five sons, and seven daughters. *Henry (1813-6 Sep 1870).

It produces a large poisonous fruit (the \\"football fruit\\") which can be made edible by fermentation. The taxonomy of the tree is uncertain and it may also be classed in the Flacourtiaceae or the Violales. Ecology and cultivation The tree requires many years to mature and the seeds are therefore most frequently harvested from wild trees, as it is not economically feasible to cultivate. Although poisonous to humans, the seeds of the tree form part of the natural diet of the babirusa (Babyroussa babyrussa).  Culinary uses  Pangium edule seeds used as spice in Indonesian cooking (rawon beef stew) The fresh fruit and seeds contain hydrogen cyanide and are deadly poisonous if consumed without prior preparation. The seeds are first boiled and then buried in ash, banana leaves and earth for forty days, during which time, they turn from a creamy white colour to dark brown or black. The method relies on the fact that the hydrogen cyanide released by the boiling and fermentation is water-soluble and easily washed out. The kernels may be ground up to form a thick black gravy called rawon, popular dishes include nasi rawon, beef stew in keluwek paste, popular in East and Central Java, and sambal rawon, rawon stew made with beef or chicken also exists in East Java. In West Java and Jakarta, gabus pucung or snakehead fish in pucung paste soup is a popular traditional dish in Betawi cuisine. The Toraja dish pammarrasan (black spice with fish or meat, also sometimes with vegetables) uses the black keluak powder. In Singapore and Malaysia, the seeds are best known as an essential ingredient in ayam (chicken) or babi (pork) buah keluak, a mainstay of Peranakan cuisine. Dusun tribe from Borneo use this pounded kernel as main ingredient for making local signature dish called bosou, sour taste fermented fish. People of Minahasa tribe in North Sulawesi use young leaves as vegetable. The leaves will be sliced into small part then it is cooked by mixing with herbs and pork fat or meat inside bamboo.

He gives them Rs 2 lakh to each to settle their debts; he too takes a part of the money to settle his sister's life. He utilizes the balance amount to construct a school building in the village and names it after Sivaji. However, Appa Rao makes everyone believe that they got a prize in lottery. Accidentally, Sivaji's parents and sister reach the village and Appa Rao comes to know the truth. He feels guilty as he had already spent the money. So, he mortgages his house to a local trader (Jeeva) and spends it for the bypass surgery of Sivaji's father. He also promises to marry Sivaji's sister sacrificing his love with Padma. But on the day of marriage, the President of the village (Chalapathi Rao) tells to Gayathri that Appa Rao killed Sivaji and robbed the Money and wants to marry Gayathri to avoid future legal problems. Gayathri believes it and Appa Rao is beaten severely. But Raju and the Local Trader reveal the truth and save Appa Rao. Padma is married to Appa Rao in the climax as Gaythri understands their Love.

Sometimes aggregation can be done at a conceptual level. Examples A simple example of syntactic aggregation is merging the two sentences John went to the shop and John bought an apple into the single sentence John went to the shop and bought an apple. Syntactic aggregation can be much more complex than this. For example, aggregation can embed one of the constituents in the other; e.g., we can aggregate John went to the shop and The shop was closed into the sentence John went to the shop, which was closed. From a pragmatic perspective, aggregating sentences together often suggests to the reader that these sentences are related to each other. If this is not the case, the reader may be confused. For example, someone who reads John went to the shop and bought an apple may infer that the apple was bought in the shop; if this is not the case, then these sentences should not be aggregated. Algorithms and issues Aggregation algorithms must do two things: * Decide when two constituents should be aggregated * Decide how two constituents should be aggregated, and create the aggregated structure The first issue, deciding when to aggregate, is poorly understood. Aggegration decisions certainly depend on the semantic relations between the constituents, as mentioned above; they also depend on the genre (e.g., bureaucratic texts tend to be more aggregated than instruction manuals). They probably should depend on rhetorical and discourse structure.D Scott and C de Souza (1990). Getting the Message Across in RST- based Text Generation. In Dale et al (eds)Current Research in Natural Language Generation. Academic Press The literacy level of the reader is also probably important (poor readers need shorter sentences).S Williams and E Reiter (2008). Generating basic skills reports for low-skilled readers. Natural Language Engineering 14:495-535 But we have no integrated model which brings all these factors together into a single algorithm. With regard to the second issue, there have been some studies of different types of aggregation, and how they should be carried out. Harbusch and Kempen describe several syntactic aggregation strategies. In their terminology, John went to the shop and bought an apple is an example of forward conjunction Reduction K Harbusch and G Kempen (2009). Generating clausal coordinate ellipsis multilingually: A uniform approach based on postediting. In Proc of ENLG-2009 28:105-144. . Much less is known about conceptual aggregation. Di Eugenio et al. show how conceptual aggregation can be done in an intelligent tutoring system, and demonstrate that performing such aggregation makes the system more effective (and that conceptual aggregation make a bigger impact than syntactic aggregation).B Di Eugenio, D Fossati, D Yu (2005).

Software Unfortunately there is not much software available for performing aggregation. However the SimpleNLG systemA Gatt and E Reiter (2009).

Luigi Fenaroli graduated in agriculture at the Higher School of Agronomy at the University of Milan in 1921. He performed several naturalistic expeditions, on behalf of the Reale societ√† geografica italiana (Italian Royal Geographical Society). In 1930 he was in Angola and spent 1932 and 1933 in the Brazilian Amazon. In 1933 he was appointed vice-director of the Stazione sperimentale di selvicoltura (Forestry experimental station) in Florence. In 1943 he moved to the Istituto sperimentale di pioppicoltura (Poplar experimental station) in Casale Monferrato in Piedmont. In 1946 he became director of the \\"Maize experimental station\\", established by eminent agronomist Tito Vezio Zapparoli. There he directed the Hybrid Maize Program, designing, from 1948 to 1953, the experimental field tests plan for the trials of the American hybrids introduced to Italy after the Second World War. He shaped the program for the collection of seed accessions of traditional Italian varieties of maize during 1954 and 1955, and sponsored the program selection of inbred lines, fixed from such varieties and their combinations with American lines, under the coordination of his pupil and friend Aureliano Brandolini. From 1968 to 1974 he directed the newly established Istituto sperimentale di assestamento forestale e alpicoltura (Forestry and Alpiculture Management Institute) in Trento. Luigi Fenaroli performed several teaching assignments, starting as junior professor at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Milan and as an interim chair of agriculture in Iseo. He later taught tropical forestry at the Istituto agronomico coloniale, now known as the Istituto agronomico per l'oltremare in Florence, and sub-tropical and tropical agriculture at the University of Milan. He was in charge of systematic botany, phytogeography, silviculture, and alpiculture courses at both the University of Milan and the University of Piacenza. As a geneticist he was visiting professor to several universities. In 1946 he traveled to Illinois, in order to study maize breeding techniques and in 1964 he was invited by the Canadian government to study potato breeding. He visited Egypt and Japan, in order to disseminate the lessons learnt in his studies. His scientific activity resulted in about 275 publications, on subjects ranging from phytogeography to systematic botany, forestry to botany, as well as on flora and nature conservation. Several of his papers dealt with the study of the localization of endemic species in the Insubria region, and of mountain and forestry livelihood of Northern Italy. His most relevant scientific books include: * Il larice nelle Alpi orientali italiane (Larch in the Eastern Italian Alps), 1936, for which he was awarded the prize of the Accademia d‚ÄôItalia; * L‚Äôambiente fisico-agrario dei paesi caldi (The Physical-Agronomic Environment in Hot Climate Countries), 1943; * Le Palme e la loro utilizzazione (Palms and their uses), 1945; * Il castagno (The Chestnut Tree), 1946; * Il genere Populus (The Populus Genus), 1946; * La flora delle Alpi (Flora of the Alps), 1956; * I Carex d‚ÄôItalia (The Carex in Italy), 1951; * Il genere Styzolobium (The Styzolobium Genus), 1952; * La vegetazione e flora delle prealpi lombarde (Plants and Flora of the Lombardy Pre-Alps). As an editor he was in charge of the publishing the following books: * Iconographia Mycologica by Giacomo Bresadola, in collaboration with G. B.

To this end, he founded a religious institute of men. He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.  Life  Early life Orione was born into a poor family at Pontecurone, in the Province of Alessandria, in the Piedmont region of Italy, on the vigil of the feast day of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist. He was named after Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and Saint John the Baptist. He was baptized the next day by Michele Cattaneo, the parish priest of the town. His father, Vittorio, was a street paver of few words and his mother, Carolina, was an energetic, pious, thrifty homemaker.Venturelli, D. G., The Blessed Don Louis Orione: A short Biography, 3rd Edition, Rome: Generalate House of the Work, 1981, pp. 3‚Äì4 At thirteen years of age he entered the Franciscan Friary of Voghera (Pavia), but he left after one year owing to poor health.\\"Luigi Orione (1872‚Äì1940)\\", Vatican From 1886 to 1889 Orione was a student at the Valdocco Oratory in Turin operated by the Salesians of Don Bosco. There he gained the attention of John Bosco, the founder, who numbered him among his favorite pupils. From the age of 13, Luigi began to suffer health problems. However, three years later, in 1888, he was present at Bosco's death in Turin in 1888. At that moment his ailments were miraculously cured. Orione was determined to become a priest and entered the seminary of the Archdiocese of Turin. He became a member of both the San Marziano Society for Mutual Help and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1892, inspired by the education he had received from the followers of John Bosco, the 20-year-old seminarian opened his own oratory to educate the poor boys of the city, and the following year he started a boarding school for the poor. He was ordained a priest on April 13, 1895. Founder Starting in 1899, Orione started to gather a group of priests and clerics that were to become Piccola Opera della Divina Provvidenza (Little Work of Divine Providence). In 1903 the group received the full authorization of the bishop as a religious congregation called the Sons of Divine Providence. One of the priests who was in his inner circle was Lorenzo Perosi, who later became Perpetual Director of the Sistine Chapel Choir and one of the most famous composers of sacred music. Perosi was born in the same year and the same region as Orione; they remained lifelong friends. Don Orione was buried in the Santuario di Nostra Signora della Guardia in Tortona, the church that he himself built in 1931, with the help of priests and acolytes. It was built in gratitude to the Madonna for ending the hostilities of World War I. It is the most important pilgrimage site in the world for Orione's followers. In 1908 Orione went to Messina, Sicily, and Reggio Calabria, Calabria, both of which had been devastated by earthquakes. He dedicated three years to help those in need, most especially the caring of orphans. In 1915 he went to Marsica when that region had a similarly devastating earthquake. That same year he founded the Little Missionary Sisters of Charity. At the end of World War I, Orione began to expand his work. He founded schools, farming colonies, charity organizations and nursing homes‚Äîalways with a special emphasis on helping orphans and the poor. Over the next two decades, he started foundations throughout Italy and the Americas. Shrine of the Madonna della Guardia  In 1931, he founded the Shrine of the Madonna della Guardia in Tortona, which to this day is the principal church in the world for the Orionine order. It is also a center for annual music festivals in honor of Orione's friend, the hitherto mentioned Perosi.  Final illness In the winter of 1940, Orione started to suffer serious cardiac and pulmonary ailments. He went to Sanremo to recuperate, but not without a tinge of regret. On March 8, 1940, on the eve of his departure for Sanremo, Don Orione is recorded as saying, \\"It is not among the palm trees that I would like to die,\\" he said, \\"but amongst the poor who are Jesus Christ.\\"The Blessed Don Louis Orione: A short Biography, p. 94 Four days later, surrounded by fellow priests of his Orionine order, Luigi Orione died. His last words were, \\"Jesus, Jesus! Jesus! I am going...\\"The Blessed Don Louis Orione: A short Biography p. 95 Now he is the Patron Saint of the Abandoned. Saint Luigi Orione's body in Sanctuary of Nostra Signora della Guardia, in Tortona, Italy Veneration Orione's mortal remains have rested in the crypt of the Shrine of La Madonna della Guardia in Tortona, which he himself founded, since his burial on March 19, 1940 His body was later exhumed in 1965 for examination. On October 26, 1980, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II. Nearly 24 years later, he was canonized by that same pope, on May 16, 2004.Homily of John Paul II Today the charitable organizations begun by Orione are still operating in abundance throughout the world.

This introduction of the young women was accompanied by presents to their new phratores, which were called gamelia (Suidas, s. v.; Schol. ad Dem. c. Eubul. p. 1312.) The women were enrolled in the lists of the phratries, and this enrolment was also called gamelia. The presents seem to have consisted in a feast given to the phratores, and the phratores in return made some offerings to the gods on behalf of the young bride. (Pollux, iii. 3, viii. 9, 28.) The acceptance of the presents and the permission to enroll the bride in the registers of the phratria, was equivalent to a declaration that she was considered a true citizen, and that consequently her children would have legitimate claims to all the rights and privileges of citizens. (Herm. Lelir. d. griech. Staatsalt. ¬ß 100, n. 1.) ‚Ä¢ - Gamelia was also the name of a sacrifice offered to Athena on the day previous to the marriage of a girl. She was taken by her parents to the temple of the goddess in the Acropolis, where the offerings were made on her behalf. Suidas, s. v. proteleia) The plural, Gameliai was used to express wedding solemnities in general. (Lycophron, ap, Etym. m.s.v.)

The term derives from the Cadillac automobile, which has represented American luxury goods since its introduction in 1902, and as a health care metaphor dates to the 1970s. The term gained popularity in the early 1990s during the debate over the Clinton health care plan of 1993, and was also widespread during debate over possible excise taxes on \\"Cadillac\\" plans during the health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration. (Bills proposed by Clinton and Obama did not use the term \\"Cadillac\\".) A study published in Health Affairs in December 2009 found that high-cost health plans do not provide unusually rich benefits to enrollees. The researchers found that 3.7% of the variation in the cost of family coverage in employer- sponsored health plans is attributable to differences in the actuarial value of benefits. 6.1% Of the variation is attributable to the combination of benefit design and plan type (e.g., PPO, HMO, etc.). The employer's industry and regional variations in health care costs explain part of the variation. The researchers conclude \\"‚Ä¶that analysts should not equate high-cost plans with Cadillac plans, but that in fact other factors‚Äîindustry and cost of medical inputs‚Äîare as important in predicting whether a plan is a high-cost plan. Without appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities.\\" The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), imposes an annual 40% excise tax on plans with annual premiums exceeding $10,800 for individuals or $29,500 for a family starting in 2020, to be paid by insurers. The tax was originally set to take effect in 2018. However, in December 2015, a law delayed the start date to 2020. In January 2018, the implementation was postponed until 2022. The tax is not imposed on the total cost of the plan, but on the costs exceeding the aforementioned values, which, after 2020, will adjust to inflation annually. These costs include any part of a person's income allocated to flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement accounts, and health savings accounts, but not expenditures for stand-alone dental, vision, accident, disability, or long- term care insurance coverage. After the December 2015 changes, the tax is now a deductible business expense, reducing the impact on businesses that pay income tax. The tax is intended to do three things: help finance the PPACA; reduce overall health care costs; and address the unequal tax benefit of excluding employer-based health insurance coverage from taxes. Although the tax plan was positioned to combat a \\"luxury\\", it will affect more employees over time. The threshold is initially indexed to Consumer Price Index (CPI), plus 1 percentage point. Starting in 2021, it is indexed to unmodified CPI. However, medical inflation is higher than general inflation. This means as healthcare costs rise, more employees' plans will be subjected to the tax. It also will impact, possibly eliminate, some healthcare savings accounts, which are included in the plan cost calculation. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated 26 percent of all employers would face the tax in at least one of their plans in 2018, when the tax was then scheduled to be implemented. Labor unions have also opposed this tax because it would be \\"very disruptive\\" to their healthcare plans and have asked that their members be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to low-income workers in the new health exchanges. As of 2017, there is a bipartisan effort in Congress to repeal the 40% tax--H.R. 2050 introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) and H.R. 879 introduced by Rep. Frank Guinta (R-NH). In addition, the Alliance to Fight the 40, a broad based coalition of public and private sector employer organizations, unions, health care companies, businesses, and other stakeholders that support employer-sponsored health coverage, is working to repeal the 40% tax.

In 2007 young-Earth creationists Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort participated in a televised debate, parts of which were aired on ABC Nightline, on the existence of God. Kirk Cameron held up composite pictures of what \\"we imagined would be genuine species-to-species transitional forms. They called one a 'crocoduck' and another was called a 'birddog'.\\" The \\"crocoduck\\" was an animal with the head of a crocodile and the body of a duck, the \\"bullfrog\\" was an animal with the head of a bull and the body of a frog, and the \\"sheepdog\\" was an animal with the head of a dog and the body of a sheep. These pictures were used as a straw man argument to ridicule the theory of evolution as represented by Cameron and Comfort. This claim was widely publicized and ridiculed as an example of creationist misconceptions. In The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, the evolutionary scientist Richard Dawkins included a section titled 'Show me your crocoduck!' in which he compared this to the question put by another creationist as to why there was no transitional fossil \\"fronkey\\" between frogs and monkeys, and described it as a warped misunderstanding of evolution. Modern species share a common ancestor, but are neither descended from each other nor from some crude composite chimera, and ducks are not descended from crocodiles. An illustration shows the Crocoduck Tie, designed by web designer Josh Timonen in commemoration of this misconception. Dawkins has stated that \\"There are only two in existence. PZ Myers has one. I'm proud to say I have the other.\\" Dawkins' tie made a prominent appearance on an episode of The Colbert Report. Fossils Reconstruction of Anatosuchus showing its broad snout (with teeth) and upright walking posture In 2003, new fossils of several types of ancient crocodile were found, including one with a flat broad snout reminiscent of a duck's bill, though it has teeth and is obviously crocodilian rather than bird-like. This genus has been named Anatosuchus or \\"DuckCroc\\", and it had an upright stance rather than the sprawled legs of modern crocodiles. Pelagornithid seabirds are also compared to aquatic crocodilians and are in fact recovered as stem-waterfowl, rendering them literal crocoducks. The most recent common ancestor of duck and crocodiles is the base of the Archosauria clade, and was probably superficially similar to modern crocodiles. No fossil of this common ancestor are known to exist, but groups such as Phytosauria and Proterochampsia are near to the base of the archosaur clade. Although the phylogenetic distance from these groups to ducks and crocodiles are equal, in form and likely behaviour they are more similar to crocodiles. In literature The author and illustrator Chih-Yuan Chen from Taiwan produced the bestselling children's story Guji Guji in 2004, a modern-day twist on The Ugly Duckling, in which a crocodile egg rolls into a duck's nest and is raised in a brood of ducklings, growing up as a \\"crocoduck\\" who thinks he is \\"not a bad crocodile\\", but \\"not exactly a duck either.\\"  See also  * Creation‚Äìevolution controversy * Intelligent design * Kitzmiller v.

She was the secret morganatic spouse of Prince Charles Philip, Duke of S√∂dermanland.  Biography  Ribbing was the daughter of the nobles Seved Svensson Ribbing and Anna Gyllenstierna. She was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Dowager Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. On 5 March 1620, she married Prince Charles. The wedding was kept secret because the Queen Dowager had forbidden the match, and was witnessed by Ribbing's sister Christina Ribbing. The wedding contract was signed: \\"Your faithfull husband, as long as I live, Carolus Philippus\\", and: \\"Your Royal Highness humble servant as long as I live, Elizabeth Ribbing\\". Because the marriage was kept secret, Ribbing was forced to defy her brother's wish that she marry her relative, Knut Lilieh√∂√∂k (1603‚Äì1664). In 1622, she became a widow. She was pregnant at the death of her spouse, and was harassed by her family because of it until her sister, her wedding witness, revealed the marriage. She was later married to Knut Lilieh√∂√∂k, governor of Turku. Her daughter, Elisabet Carlsdotter Gyllenhielm (1622‚Äì1682), was taken into the household of the Queen Dowager: she was married to the nobles Axel Turesson Natt och Dag (1645) and Baltasar Marskalk and lady-in-waiting to Queens Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp.

Prior to 2018, it was known as the Garda Traffic Corps. Duties and organisation The main responsibility of the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) is to improve road safety and reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injury on Ireland's roads. Each Division of the Garda S√≠och√°na now has a Roads Policing Unit of its own, with an additional regional unit assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region. Dublin Metropolitan Region The Dublin Metropolitan Region Roads Policing Unit was the first dedicated traffic unit, established in 1953. It is headed by a Chief Superintendent and supported by 2 Superintendents, 2 Inspectors, 15 Sergeants, 101 Garda√≠ operating from a facility at Dublin Castle. This unit supports all Divisional Roads Policing Units within the Dublin Metropolitan area as well as conducting checkpoints and patrol of the entire duration of the M50 motorway. Programs Following a review by the Traffic Corps of collisions involving fatalities, serious injury, and minor injury, the organisation compiled a list of 'Collision Prone Zones' which was published on the Garda website. These zones were subsequently subject to 'targeted enforcement of road traffic and road transport legislation'. As of 2016, these zones are subject to monitoring by the operators of speed detection vans. Vehicles Garda Roads Policing Units use a range of vehicles, including motorcycles, marked and unmarked cars and 4x4 vehicles. Marked Roads Policing Unit vehicles are visibly different from standard Garda vehicles in that they feature the words \\"Roads Policing\\" and its Irish translation, \\"P√≥il√≠n√∫ B√≥ithre\\", along with full-coverage high visibility blue and yellow Battenburg markings. Cars One of the main Roads Policing vehicles is the Hyundai i40 Tourer, with a smaller number of Opel Insignia Estates and Hyundai i30 Tourers in service. A number of Hyundai i40 and older Ford Mondeo saloons are used as unmarked vehicles in certain units. SUVs Pearse Street Divisional Traffic Corps 2015 Fiat Ducato The Mitsubishi Pajero and Ford Ranger currently serve as the unit's 4x4s, and are used for motorway patrol. The Roads Policing Unit also operates a four-door Isuzu D-Max as a motorway support vehicle. Vans Former Garda Traffic Corps patrol vehicle Pearse Street Divisional Roads Policing Unit is equipped with a Fiat Ducato van for transporting cones. The Dublin Metropolitan Region Roads Policing Unit also operates a single marked Ford Transit automatic speed limit enforcement photo radar van. Motorcycles Motorcycles used by the Region Roads Policing Unit include Honda Deauville 700cc models. A number of these models were purchased in 2011, including replacements for the Yamaha FJR 1300cc which was the previous Traffic motorcycle. Former vehicles Formerly, the Ford Mondeo served as the standard patrol vehicle, in both marked and unmarked variants, with the Isuzu Trooper and later the Toyota Land Cruiser serving as the standard 4x4 vehicles. Automatic Number Plate Recognition Automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) was introduced for use by the Traffic Corps in 2009, and the 'nationwide roll-out of ANPR technology [..] completed in 2010.

Dr. Weber worked out that 1 cm2 cross section surface area of any masticatory muscle can produce approximately 10 kg force.

He also studied the relation between mechanical and bio-physiological movements of the masticatory system which shows that creating the masticatory force is directly depended to the surface area and its orientation and therefore he suggested the masticatory force systematization. According to this systematization, the masticatory force is divided in two main groups, physiological and pathological groups. The physiological masticatory force by itself is divided into three subgroups according to their localizations, anterior, general (covering the entire arch) and posterior section of the arch. The posterior group is also divided into two other groups; unilateral and bilateral.Nankali A. (2002) \\"Investigation of strength properties of the hard materials of the tooth roots\\".

Biography  Born in 1951 in San Francisco, California, Frudakis is the oldest of five children. He was born to Greek- American parents, and was raised primarily in Northwestern Indiana, with the exception of several years in Wheeling, West Virginia. As a child, Frudakis first began to sculpt under the family's kitchen table with a piece of dough given to him by his mother as she was preparing to bake bread. Growing up in Greek family culture, Frudakis began drawing and reading at a young age, initiating a lifelong discipline of studying and creating art each day. Artistic inspirations come from ancient Greeks, and sculptors Michelangelo, Bernini, Carpeaux and Rodin. Throughout his life, Frudakis has been an avid reader with a wide range of interests that inform his work. Frudakis' initial years in college were close to home in the Gary, Indiana area due to illness of his father. During this time, he spent summers working in steel mills, and in 1970 to 1971, attended Indiana University Northwest Extension. In 1972, Frudakis moved to Philadelphia to study at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Concurrently, he also studied sculpture privately with Prix de Rome winner Evangelos Frudakis, his elder brother. Frudakis studied painting privately with Prix de Rome winner James Hanes. From 1977 to 1983, he attended the University of Pennsylvania, where Frudakis earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Arts.Sarah Blackman, \\"Sculpting a Life\\" (feature article on Frudakis), The Pennsylvania Gazette, Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.  Career  Early work In 1976, Frudakis married Rosalie Gluchoff. Together they began a gallery and ran Frudakis Studio, located in center city Philadelphia. Frudakis' first important commission was a portrait sculpture of Samuel L. Evans, founder of the American Foundation for Negro Affairs (AFNA); followed by portrait sculptures of Wilson Goode, former Mayor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; The Honorable K. Leroy Irvis, the first African American to serve as a State Legislature's Speaker of the House; and Joseph E. Coleman, former City Council President, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Figure and Portrait Sculpture Frudakis continued sculpting commissions with an emphasis on the figure and the portrait, as demonstrated in his many monumental works, individual portrait statues and busts, and bas-reliefs. He created sculptures of living and historic individuals that express the character and vitality of his subjects while capturing an accurate likeness. Portrait statues included notable figures, such as businessman and philanthropist John D. MacArthur, installed in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; Honorable Dame Lois Browne-Evans, the first female Bermudian justice, installed in the Dame Lois Browne Evans Building, Hamilton, Bermuda; landscape architect, journalist and public administrator Frederick Law Olmsted, installed at The North Carolina Arboretum, Asheville, North Carolina; and lawyer Clarence Darrow on view at the Rhea County Courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Freedom Sculpture Some of Frudakis's sculptures have generated controversy. When he sculpted a life-size bronze bust of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, apartheid was still in effect there. The U.S. government had advised Frudakis he could be jailed for bringing the sculpture into South Africa, so the bust was brought into the country in 1989 by diplomatic pouch. The sculpture was installed just inside the embassy's fence, visible to the public but outside the South African government's reach, standing as a statement of the U.S.‚Äôs opposition to apartheid.Gene Freedman, \\"The Unveiling of a Memorial,\\" USIA World, April 1989, pp. 10-11. Clarence Darrow Frduakis' statue of attorney Clarence Darrow, on view in front of the Rhea County Courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee since 2017, reawakened local controversy between evolutionists and creationists. In 1925, the courthouse had been the site of the Scopes \\"monkey trial,\\" where John T. Scopes was accused of unlawful teaching of human evolution in a state-funded school. Darrow represented Scopes, while William Jennings Bryan argued for the prosecution. Since 2005, a sculpture of Bryan has been on display on the courthouse lawn. The Darrow sculpture was commissioned by the Freedom From Religion Foundation and installed on the courthouse lawn in balance to the Bryan sculpture. The addition of the Darrow sculpture in 2017 was engendered dissent from some residents who remained opposed to the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools. Sports Sculpture Throughout his career Frudakis has been commissioned to create bronze portrait busts, statues and monuments of significant figures from the sports world, including golf, baseball, hockey and boxing. Payne Stewart, Pinehurst Payne Stewart sculpture at Pinehurst by Zenos Frudakis. A celebratory pose of Payne Stewart, with a leg in the air and a fist thrust to the sky, is commemorated in Frudakis' bronze statue displayed at Pinehurst Resort, North Carolina, near the spot where Stewart, in 1999, made this gesture when winning the U.S. Open. The sculpture was unveiled at Pinehurst in 2001, but its impact was not fully realized until 2014 when Pinehurst once again hosted the U.S. Open, on the 15th anniversary of Stewart's win. Attendees posed alongside the landmark Payne sculpture, mimicking the iconic pose. Thousands of television and online viewers saw these images, especially when Payne's daughter Chelsea was photographed with her father's sculpture and the PGA Tour called it on Instagram, \\"The coolest statue photo you‚Äôll see this week.\\" Payne Stewart's tribute trophy case at Pinehurst Resort also showcases Frudakis' portrait bust of Payne Stewart along with historic photos and memorabilia.Lee Pace, The Spirit of Pinehurst (Pinehurst Resort, 2007), pp. 86-87. See also World Golf Courses (Chartwell Books, 2007), pp. 144-45. Golf Legends Arnold Palmer with portrait statue. Sculptures of other golf legends include Arnold Palmer at Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in Augusta, and the Arnold Palmer Airport, Latrobe, Pennsylvania and the Arnold Palmer at Tralee, Ireland; Jack Nicklaus at the USGA Museum, Far Hills, New Jersey, and at Valhalla, Lexington, Kentucky; Dinah Shore at the Wall of Champions, Rancho Mirage, California; Bob Jones at East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta, Georgia, and U.S. Golf Association Museum, Liberty Corner, New Jersey; and Robert H. Dedman, Sr. and Richard Tufts at Pinehurst Resort, Pinehurst, North Carolina. Golf Digest commissioned Frudakis to create the bronze trophy sculpture known as The Arnie, a philanthropy award for \\"golfers who give back.\\" Baseball Hall of Famers Baseball Hall of Famers honored with Frudakis‚Äô larger-than-life sculptures include Mike Schmidt, Steve Carlton, Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts, all on view at Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A relief sculpture gives tribute to Coach Staffieri at University of Pennsylvania's Franklin Field. A public monument at the DiMaggio Children's Hospital, Hollywood, Florida, shows Joe DiMaggio kneeling to speak to a young boy, and includes the inscription, \\"We never stand so tall as when we stoop to help a child.\\" Champion Boxer James J. Braddock World champion boxer James J. Braddock (known as \\"the Cinderella Man\\") is commemorated in a 10-foot 1,500 lbs. bronze statue at James J. Braddock North Hudson Park, North Bergen, New Jersey, near where the boxer lived and trained. The sculpture was unveiled on Sept. 27, 2018, attended by a large crowd including local and county officials, Braddock's family, fans and other notable boxers Gerry Cooney, Pat Murphy, Randy Neumann, and the legendary \\"Bayonne Bleeder,\\" Chuck Wepner. Jimmy Braddock, grandson of James, said, \\"This statue is a reminder of the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity through determination.\\" Hockey All-Star Brian Phillip Propp A portrait bust of National Hockey League All-Star Brian Phillip Propp is displayed at the Philadelphia Flyers Hall of Fame, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Major Works Frudakis has sculpted a wide range of subject matter in bronze, stainless steel and clay, including monuments, memorial, portrait busts, statues, military, sports, animals, people and historic figures. The sculptures range in size and technique from relief panels to monuments. His best-known and most acclaimed works include Freedom, the United States Air Force Memorial Honor Guard, Payne Stewart, John D. McArthur, Clarence Darrow, Frederick Law Olmsted, James Braddock and Nina Simone. John D. McArthur The 8-ft-high bronze statue honoring Palm Beach Gardens‚Äô city founder John D. MacArthur is mounted on a 3-ft-high base of granite from a quarry in Vermont. Unveiled on Nov. 21, 2010 as part of the city's 50th anniversary celebration, the sculpture is installed at the city hall entrance on Military Trail. Frederick Law Olmsted Frederick Law Olmsted sculpture by Zenos Frudakis. Commissioned by The North Carolina Arboretum, the first larger-than-life-size sculpture of Frederick Law Olmsted is a tribute to the man known as the father of American landscape architecture. It was unveiled at a ceremony on Apr. 22, 2016 at the Arboretum in Asheville, North Carolina. The Olmsted sculpture is sited on a large natural stone in the Arboretum's Blue Ridge Court with a view of the Pisgah National Forest behind it. Frudakis states, \\"It was important for me to create a sculpture that embodied the idea of Frederick Law Olmsted as a visionary of monumental proportions. In his hands he holds the abstract topographic map, which came from his mind and became the land that he stood on.\\" Nina Simone Nina Simone sculpture by Zenos Frudakis, Nina Simone Plaza in Tryon, NC. Photo credit: Meg Rogers The memorial sculpture of Nina Simone depicts the \\"High Priestess of Soul\\" seated atop a stone base while performing on a floating keyboard. The keyboard is sculpted in the form of a wave‚Äîevoking the sense of grace, rhythm and music. Simone's daughter and Broadway actress Lisa Simone Kelly posed for Frudakis as he sculpted the eight-foot bronze portrait statue. The memorial of the world-renowned singer and human rights activist includes her ashes within a sculpted heart that is welded to the interior of the figure's chest. The Nina Simone sculpture was dedicated on Feb. 16, 2017, which would have been Simone's 77th birthday. The memorial resides in Nina Simone Plaza in her birthplace of Tyron, North Carolina. Molly Maguires The larger-than-life Molly Maguires Memorial depicts the defining moment in Molly history, The Day of the Rope (June 21, 1877), during which ten victims of the Molly era lost their lives. All were represented by a single hooded figure on a scaffold the moment before hanging. The emotional impact of the sculpture provokes a reconsideration of history. A cast of this sculpture is in the collection of the State Museum of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Monuments Frudakis‚Äô first public monument is the Elephant Fountain‚Äîa life-size sculpture of an elephant playfully spraying water on a boy sitting on the elephant's back. It was commissioned by department store owner Stockton Strawbridge for the Burlington Shopping Mall in Burlington, New Jersey. This led to a lifetime career of creating public monuments, including the sculptures Path to Manhood, Dallas, Texas; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Monument, Chester, Pennsylvania; Knowledge is Power, Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey; the United States Air Force National Memorial Honor Guard in Arlington, Virginia; and Freedom in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Knowledge is Power Knowledge is Power sculpture by Zenos Frudakis. Using Francis Bacon's quote, \\"Knowledge is Power\\" as the central theme, Frudakis sculpted this monument to inspire the process and pleasure of learning. Using the visual metaphor of an open book, the 8-ft high by 12-ft wide sculpture features Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein emerging from its pages. These influential figures represent key shifts in the understanding of the world and its sciences. Relief faces and quotes from 31 iconic figures in science, history, mathematics and the arts portray contrasting theories, philosophies and politics, as well as struggles shared across generations. On the left page, a large relief portrait of Charles Darwin is encircled by early thinkers, artists, activists, politicians and scientists along with their famous ideas or works. On the right page, Albert Einstein steps out dimensionally as did his ideas about space and time, and he is surrounded by more contemporary figures, concepts and quotations. The viewer is led through a process of exploration and is left to weigh countering viewpoints and discover their personal resonance. Installed in 2014, the sculpture is located at the entrance to James Hall at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. United States Air Force Memorial Honor Guard United States Air Force Memorial as seen at night. The United States Air Force Memorial Honor Guard, a 16-ft high monument, consists of four eight-foot bronze figures, patinaed in blue-gray, standing side by side and mounted on a ten-by-two-foot bronze base. The two middle figures are flag bearers, carrying the United States and Air Force flags and battle streamers, flanked by two rifle guards. The Honor Guard soldiers depicted in the Air Force Memorial are, from left to right, a Caucasian man, an African American man, a Latino man and a Caucasian woman. The sculpture stands before the granite inscription wall bearing the names of U.S. Air Force recipients of the Medal of Honor. The facing south wall is inscribed with Air Force core-value quotations: \\"Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.\\" The monument stands adjacent to the memorial's three stainless-steel spires created by James Ingo Freed that soar above the statues. The memorial is located near The Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. The design of the sculpture was initially more sketch-like but as it progressed became more detailed with precise measurements for positioning of clothing, ties, medals, buttons, shoes, straps, belts, accessories, flags and rifles, following the strict guidelines of the Honor Guard. (This approach was in complete contrast to another sculpture Frudakis was working on concurrently known as Freedom.) The Air Force Memorial's dedication ceremony in 2006 was attended by approximately 30,000 people, and it began the service's 60th Anniversary Commemoration, \\"From Heritage to Horizons‚ÄîCommemorating 60 Years of Air and Space Power.\\" Freedom The Freedom sculpture in Philadelphia, PA with sculptor Zenos Frudakis. Freedom is the most widely recognized public sculpture by Frudakis. Installed in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at 20 ft. long by 8 ft. high and 7,000 lbs., the monument portrays transformation through the sequential emergence of a figure in four stages of breaking free from a wall. Influenced by Rodin's Gates of Hell, Frudakis includes many smaller sculptures and personal elements within the monument's wall. The bronze's maquette, the sculptor's hand and sculpture tools are cast into the wall. The anatomical man as well as portraits, figures and reliefs are shown partially sculpted, revealing the process of creation.Sculpture Review, Changing the American Landscape, Fall 2001, Vol.L, No.3, p.32, National Sculpture Society, New York, New York. The back surface of the sculpture's wall (not visible in the current installation) includes additional elements that Frudakis calls the \\"Other Side of Freedom.\\" It consists of mummified forms in a tomb-like structure that evolved as Frudakis was creating the monument.

Life and work Amancio Williams was born in Buenos Aires in 1913. His father, Alberto Williams, was a well-known composer of chamber music and the founder of the Buenos Aires Music Conservatory. He enrolled at the School of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires, though an interest in aviation led him to leave school during his third year. This sabbatical ended in 1938, when he enrolled at the same university's School of Architecture. He graduated in 1941 and created a portfolio of numerous prospective designs, though he found buyers for only a few, and among these was a residence in Mar del Plata commissioned by his own father. The elder Williams had purchased a 2-hectare (5 acre) property in what were then the wooded outskirts of the seaside city. A stream running through the land became the centerpiece for the architect's 1942 design for a modern, 9 by 27 meter (30 by 90 foot) weatherized concrete structure, which was set on an archway straddling the stream.Noticias Arquitectura: Casa del Puente Casa del Puente, in Mar del Plata. Williams also designed the home's minimalist interiors, fashioning the interior doors, fixtures and boiserie in a nearby workshop, as well most of the furniture. The concrete used in its construction was also chemically weatherized at the facility, so done to allow its use in the design without the need for cladding, which Williams felt would take from the \\"honesty of the materials.\\" Christened the Casa del Puente (\\"Bridge House\\") upon its completion in 1946, it served as composer Alberto Williams' home until his death in 1952. His design proposals in 1945 for a new international airport, to be built on the R√≠o de la Plata and connected to the city via causeway, were rejected in favor of what became Ministro Pistarini International Airport, and aside from three Corrientes Province hospitals, he would complete no significant government works in subsequent decades. He was assigned by Le Corbusier, however, to supervise construction for the Curutchet House, a residence designed in 1949 by the Swiss architect for Dr. Pedro Curutchet, a prominent La Plata physician. He was invited to display his ideas on acoustics at La Sorbonne, and the Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Walter Gropius, organized exhibits of his works in 1951 and 1955, on which latter occasion Williams was a guest lecturer. During the 1950s, he developed designs based on what he called hollow vaults. These were concrete pillars that, by their design, could drain rainwater while supporting the building above as stilts. He later employed the concept for the 1966 Bunge y Born exhibit at the La Rural Exposition grounds and in 1968 for the German Embassy, both in Buenos Aires, as well as for a monument to the reconstruction of Berlin. Williams was inducted into the American Institute of Architects as an honorary member in 1962. After 1974, he worked on \\"the city humanity needs,\\" a plan for an above- ground metropolis supported by his hollow vaults for the purpose of reducing land use.

The Bridge House which was home to a sister of Williams' until her death in 1966, was purchased by a Mar del Plata radio station, but ultimately returned to the architect. He maintained it until his death in 1989, and it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997. This failed to secure it adequate funding for its maintenance, however, and the historic property was ultimately abandoned and gutted by fire in September 2004.

Life Philip Shuttleworth was second son of Humphrey Shuttleworth, vicar of Kirkham in Lancashire from 1771 to 1812, and of Preston from 1784 to 1809, an anti-papal writer. Shuttleworth, born at Kirkham on 9 February 1782, was educated at the Preston grammar school, and at Winchester College, which he entered in 1796. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 24 December 1800, and graduated B.A. in 1800, M.A. in 1811, and B.D. and D.D. in 1822. In 1803 he won the Chancellor's Latin-verse prize, the subject being 'Byzantium.' Soon after graduating he became tutor to the Hon. Algernon Herbert, and at a subsequent date to Charles Richard Fox, son of Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland. He was Tutor and Fellow of New College until 1822, and proctor of the university in 1820. In 1822, he was unanimously chosen Warden of New College. He held strong whig views, which were toned down in later life, and was an opponent of the tractarian movement. On 19 November 1824, he was presented by Lord Holland to the rectory of Foxley, Wiltshire, and in September 1840 was appointed bishop of Chichester. He died at his palace at Chichester on 7 January 1842. He married at Hambleton, Buckinghamshire, in 1823, Emma Martha, daughter of George Welch of High Leek in Tunstal parish, Lancashire. By her he had five daughters, one of whom as Frances Bevan the translator and poet. A son, Philip Ughtred, died as a student of Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 November 1848. Works He wrote occasional verse, some of which appears in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1861, and in Elizabeth Oak Gordon's Life of William Buckland, 1891. His playful \\"Specimen of a Geological Lecture\\" is given in Charles Daubeny's Fugitive Poems connected with Natural History and Physical Science, 1869. Shuttleworth published, besides separate sermons: * Sermons on some of the leading Principles of Christianity, 2 vols, 1827‚Äì34; 3rd edition 1840. * A Paraphrastic Translation of the Apostolic Epistles, with Notes, 1829; 5th edition 1854. * The Consistency of the Whole Scheme of Revelation with itself, and with Human Reason, 1832. * Not Tradition but Scripture, 1838, opposed to the Oxford tracts. * Three Sermons before the University of Oxford, 1840.

The Famine Codes defined three levels of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine. \\"Scarcity\\" was defined as three successive years of crop failure, crop yields of one-third or one- half normal, and large populations in distress. \\"Famine\\" further included a rise in food prices to above 140% of \\"normal\\", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality. In order to address the issues of famine in India they created an Indian Famine commission to create ways to prevent and avoid future famine in India. So in 1880 the secretary of commission wrote a draft of the Indian Famine Code. This famine code became the basis of famine prevention until the 1970s. More famine codes were created after the Indian Famine Codes (Bihar) but they addressed similar ideas that the Indian one did, the Indian Famine code was the foundation of multiple famine codes/ scales. Famine codes and scales measure the intensity and magnitude of the famine. Summary of published research: This famine code was one of the first attempts to predict famine, and by predicting it, prevent it. When the British created these 'Indian Famine Codes' they were the first modern reaction to the famines in India. The codes classified food scarcity on a scale of intensity and had steps that governments were required to take to mitigate the risk of famine.

Only 77 examples of the model were ever made because of the high production costs.

The Uirapuru bears a strong resemblance to the Jensen Interceptor, which entered production the same year that Uirapuru production ended, with many saying that the Interceptor took styling cues from the Uirapuru.  Performance  Unlike many other sports cars of its time that used fiberglass bodies, the Uirapuru had a hand built sheet steel body placed on a bespoke monoblock frame. The Uirapuru was also one of the first Brazilian cars to undergo wind tunnel testing in the Aeronautical Technological Institute (ITA), in S√£o Jos√© dos Campos. The original 4200 GT was powered by a 6-cylinder 4271cc Chevrolet truck engine which used three SU carburetors and produced 155 hp.

He is known for his journal, kept while traveling through the territory which had previously been part of the New Netherland. Documenting his journey in 1679-1680, it offers a description of the landscape and the lifestyle of inhabitants of the region in the late 17th century. The diary journals the travels of Danckaerts and Peter Sluyter (1645, Wesel‚Äì1722), two emissaries of Friesland pietists known as Labadists, journeying to North America to find a location for the establishment of a community. It is one of the earliest descriptions of the region that had been part of New Netherland, now New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Danckaerts and Sluyter eventually met Ephraim George Herman, the son of Augustine Herman, and he introduced them to his father in 1679. Initially Herman did not want to grant land to them, only permit their settlement, but in 1683, he conveyed a tract of 3,750 acres (15 km¬≤) to them because of legal issues. The group established a colony, with Peter Sluyter as the principal administrator, but it was not very successful, not growing larger than 100 people. The settlement ceased to exist after 1720. The original Dutch manuscript was acquired in 1864 by Henry C. Murphy, then corresponding secretary of the Long Island Historical Society, in an old book- store in Amsterdam. Murphy published an English translation in 1867. A revised edition appeared as Original Narratives of Early American History, edited by J. B. Bartlett of the Maryland Historical Society and J. F. Jameson, director of the Department of Historical Research in the Carnegie Institutions of Washington in 1913.Project Gutenberg etext of the 1913 edition Danckaert and Sluyter returned to Europe on July 23, 1680, and came back the same year with the people who would form the colony. Danckaert then went to the settlement of La Providence in Dutch Guiana, which lasted very briefly. In 1684 he became a citizen of Maryland, but soon returned to the Netherlands. Living most of the rest of his life in Wieuwerd, he died in Middelburg between 1702 and 1704.

He ruled from his election in 1912 until his death in 1943. Ofori Atta was educated in Basel Mission schools and at its Akuropon seminary, now named the Presbyterian College of Education, Akropong. He left the seminary after two years to work as a solicitor's clerk, and then served in the West African Frontier Force, fighting during the Yaa Asantewaa War.Roger S. Cocking, The History of Ghana, 2005, p. 295 Elected Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa in 1912, he became a member of the Legislative Council in 1916.F. M. Bourret, Ghana: the road to independence, 1919-1957, p. 161. In 1934, he led a Gold Coast Delegation to London to petition the British Parliament for official majority of Africans on the legislative council, permanent African representative on the Governor\`s executive council and eligibility for non-chiefs to be provincial members of the executive council. He was also instrumental in setting up multiple schools, including Achimota School or College (formerly Prince of Wales School), where most colonial Gold Coast leaders and current prominent Ghanaian leaders schooled.Trip Down Memory Lane \\"Ofori Atta was the son of a senior official of the palace; his mother was the descendant of one of the founders of the kingdom....

He created the Ofori-Atta dynasty by privileging education both amongst his sons and daughters, through two paths, ‚Äúone firmly rooted in a concern for binding the state by the traditionally sanctioned method of multiple marriage and the other rooted in his strong case for ‚Äòmodernisation‚Äô and ‚Äòprogress‚Äô.‚ÄùRathbone, Murder and Politics in Colonial Ghana (1993), p. 41.

Danquah (a founder of the United Gold Coast Convention, who hired Kwame Nkrumah as the Secretary of the party and brought him over from the UK for the fight for Independence, and who was also one of The Big Six (Ghana) that collectively led the struggle for the independence of the Gold Coast). He was the father of Aaron Ofori-Atta, (the fourth Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana, a Minister of Communications and Minister of Local Government), Adeline Akufo-Addo, (First Lady under the Second Republic), William Ofori Atta (a Minister of Foreign Affairs, Presidential Candidate of the UNC), Dr Kwesi Amoako-Atta (Governor of Bank of Ghana and Minister for Finance and Economic Planning under the First Republic), Dr Jones Ofori Atta (Deputy Minister for Finance and Economic Planning under the Busia government), and Susan Ofori-Atta (the first female doctor in Ghana).

He was a bay gelding sired by Al Hareb (won GB William Hill Futurity Stakes) out of Headford Lass (GB) (Red Alert (IRE)-Deep Company (GB)). Racing career Hareeba had three starts as a two-year-old without success but returned at three, and, after two further defeats, broke his maiden at Yarra Glen on 28 October 1993. This was followed with wins at Ballarat, Moonee Valley, and Flemington. In his two city wins, he broke the course record for 1,200 metres in winning by nine lengths at Moonee Valley, and defeated the following year's Caulfield Cup winner, Paris Lane, by three lengths at Flemington. After a brief let-up, Hareeba was tried in Black Type company for the first time and finished a close second to Lady Jakeo in the 1994 Australia Made Stakes. While defeated, he had finished in front of the multiple Group One winners Primacy and Schillaci, but, in a foretaste of what would be ongoing issues over the next three years, was injured and had to be spelled. At four, he failed first- up in the Manikato Stakes but won the Bobby Lewis Quality second-up and recorded further wins, later in the spring, in the Sir Rupert Steele Stakes and the Southcorp Stakes. In the new year, he resumed with an 'amazing display of sheer speed and power'Hareeba - Brief career description (including photos) in the 1995 Australia Made Stakes, which was run down the straight at Flemington (with Moonee Valley closed for renovations). Starting odds-on, Hareeba raced out to a massive lead on the flat side and won by five and a half lengths. At his next start, he raced below his best when unplaced behind Mahogany in the Lightning Stakes, and carried topweight of 58.5 kilograms when runner-up to All Our Mob in the Newmarket Handicap. Back to his best, he defeated Mahogany and Schillaci in the Stanley Wootton Stakes and again in the George Ryder Stakes (from which he was later disqualified). Hareeba was then injured and was off the scene for almost 12 months. When he resumed in the 1996 Stanley Wootten Stakes, he started favourite but finished last of six behind All Our Mob. Following another let-up, he finished second to Mamzelle Pedrille in a Flying on the Gold Coast and scored a course record-breaking win in the QTC Cup, under topweight of 60 kilograms. Seemingly with the Stradbroke Handicap at his mercy, as he was dropping to 57 kilograms, Hareeba continued his 'enigmatic' ways and was unplaced. He returned at six for a final campaign, and was unplaced in the 1997 Rubiton Stakes before breaking down completely in trackwork. Connections tried to save him and wrapped his injured leg in bandages, but, ultimately, he had to be euthanased.

Biography Early life He received a bachelor's degree from the Hotelschool The Hague, and then an MBA at the University of Groningen. Heineken He began as a graduate at Amsterdam-based Heineken International NV, the third largest brewer in the world, in 1987. Bolland worked in various international management positions in Africa and Central Europe before joining the Heineken board in 2001. He became chief operating officer in 2005. Bolland has been credited with both building and rolling out the Heineken brand internationally. Morrisons In September 2006, he was appointed CEO of the UK supermarket chain Morrisons. Morrisons had acquired Safeway in 2004 creating a 130,000 people strong retail conglomerate in the UK. The merger initially proved unsuccessful. Bolland joined after five profit warnings with a brief to turn round the company. By 2008 Morrisons had achieved strong growth in both market share and profits, and in 2008, Bolland was announced as The Times \\"Businessman of the year\\". Under his guidance, Morrisons \\"...gained significant market share from rivals\\". Marks & Spencer In November 2009, it was announced that Bolland would become CEO of Marks & Spencer Group PLC. In May 2010, he took over from the then chairman & CEO Sir Stuart Rose. Bolland launched a plan to grow M&S; into an international multi-channel retailer. The Evening Standard named Bolland as one of \\"London's 1000 most influential people\\" for 2010. During September 2011, he announced a new look store environment for M&S;'s UK stores, with a plan to complete the roll out to the entire UK estate by mid-2013. In 2011, M&S; returned to France after a 10-year absence and also started the development of a new digital platform that was launched in February 2014. In 2011, Bolland received an honorary doctorate from York St John University. He was named as \\"Most Admired Leader\\" at Management Today magazine's \\"Britain's Most Admired Companies 2011\\" awards having been nominated by his peers in the FTSE 100. In 2014 Bolland was appointed as the Prince of Wales National Ambassador for Business in the Community and in February 2015 Bolland joined the board of The Coca-Cola Company as a Director. In January 2016, it was announced that Bolland would be retiring as CEO of Marks and Spencer effective April 2016, and would be replaced by Steve Rowe.

It is an endangered species in the United States, where it occurs in three states: Illinois, Tennessee, and Alabama.USFWS. Dalea foliosa (Leafy Prairie-Clover) determined to be endangered. Federal Register May 1, 1991. As of 1997 there were 51 occurrences, mostly within the state of Tennessee. Most of these are in very poor condition and the species is in decline.Dalea foliosa. The Nature Conservancy. This is a perennial herb growing 20 to 80 centimeters tall, with a number of erect stems sprouting from a hard root crown. The leaves are each made up of hairless oval leaflets measuring up to 1.3 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a cone-shaped or cylindrical spike of many purple flowers with pointed green bracts between them. Blooming occurs in summer.Dalea foliosa. Illinois Wildflowers. The flowers are pollinated by bumblebees.Edwards, A. L., B. Wiltshire, and D. L. Nickrent. (2004). Genetic diversity in Astragalus tennesseensis and the federal endangered Dalea foliosa (Fabaceae). Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society 131(4) 279. The seeds can persist in a soil seed bank for 8 years. The plant is native to glades and prairies with limestone substrates. The habitat may be moist or wet with seeps in the calcareous ground. It may grow alongside rose pink (Sabatia angularis) and brown-eyed susan (Rudbeckia triloba). In northern Illinois, where there are disjunct occurrences of the plant, it can be found in sunny, open dolomite prairies and river terraces that are periodically burned in the natural fire regime. This plant was much more widespread in the past. The main cause of its decline is the destruction and degradation of its habitat.Dalea foliosa. Center for Plant Conservation. Much of its habitat has been consumed for development and is now in industrial and commercial use. Remaining habitat is overgrazed and invaded by introduced plant species such as Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) and Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Plants have been destroyed during road maintenance and sewer installation. In most areas, the plant grows in a habitat that requires periodic wildfire for maintenance. Fire suppression efforts prevent this natural process and the habitat becomes overgrown with large and woody vegetation. The species is also fire-dependent because the seeds must be scarified if they are to germinate. Moisture is a limiting factor for the plants once they do germinate. The plant apparently has a low rate of reproductive success as few of the plants that germinate survive. Many of the seedlings are killed in dry summer conditions or frost heave and only 5% of the plants that become seedlings reach the age of five years. The plant does not reproduce until it is 2 or 3 years old. Genetic diversity is also low. Some plants have been reintroduced to habitat where the species is hypothesized to have occurred in the prehistoric times, including part of Indiana.

For the organ he used pipe-work from the previous instrument built by Hendrick Hermans van Loon in 1679. In 1815 the organ was moved by J.W. Timpe to the Der Aa-kerk because the Broerkerk/Academiekerk had to be restored to the Roman Catholic Church.www.arpschnitger.nl After the city joined the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, the church became the church of the University of Groningen (1614). dodenakkers.nl In the 19th century the church was given back to the Roman Catholics. The church was in such a bad condition that the decision was taken to demolish it. The remains of the buried bodies found in and around the church were reburied at the Roman Catholic churchyard in town. In 1895 a new church was built on the same site as the former Broerkerk. The new church was named Sint Martinuskerk.  Saint Martinuskerk  The Saint Martinuskerk in Groningen was built in 1895. The Neogothic church was designed by P.J.H. Cuypers.

The group eventually decides on Jerome, a hip bar patron, which Peter goes on to regret when he eventually finds out that Jerome and Lois used to date. Meanwhile, Brian attempts to discover the source of Quagmire's personal dislike of him, only to become upset once Quagmire scolds him during a dinner date. The episode served as a follow-up to the exit of the main character Cleveland Brown, who left Family Guy in order to star in his own Fox spin-off, entitled The Cleveland Show. Voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who also stars as Cleveland Brown Jr. on The Cleveland Show, guest starred as Cleveland's replacement, Jerome. He would not appear again until the Season 11 episode, \\"Save the Clam\\", but he has appeared more regularly since then. It was first announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International.

Plot Upset that Cleveland left the quartet to move to Stoolbend, Virginia, Peter, Quagmire and Joe decide to interview potential friends to fill the vacancy, and are approached by a fellow bar patron named Jerome. After impressing the group with his dart skills, they decide to let Jerome join as their new fourth member. Later, when Peter introduces Jerome to Lois, she reveals that the two used to date. Peter grows jealous and, in a fit of drunken rage, throws a bottle through the window of Jerome's home, inadvertently causing a fire and burning down his house. Jerome, unaware of the fact that Peter was the vandal who burned down his house, later told Lois \\"When I find the guy who did it, I'm gonna rip his arms off and do his wife in front of him!\\" The next morning, Peter discovers that Lois has invited Jerome to live with them. As time goes on, Peter cannot contain his jealousy and eventually appears to dress as a member of the Ku Klux Klan, though it is immediately revealed that Peter's intention is to dress as a ghost carrying a torch, kicking Jerome out. During an argument, Lois reveals that Jerome had bought Peter a gift, and he goes on to apologize to Jerome for being so insensitive. Jerome forgives him and he remains friends with Peter, but admits to having had sex with Meg, to which Peter indifferently responds. Meanwhile, Brian tries to join Peter's group, but Peter says it is not a good idea because Quagmire dislikes him. Brian attempts to rectify the situation outside Quagmire's house. However, Brian ends up making things worse by mistaking Quagmire's sister, who is hiding out from her abusive boyfriend, for one of his dates. Brian tricks Quagmire into going to dinner with him by making him think Cheryl Tiegs, Quagmire's long-lost love, is the one inviting him. At dinner, Brian attempts to make small talk, but Quagmire does not soften up. Finally, Brian asks Quagmire why he does not like him. Quagmire responds with an angry tirade detailing everything about Brian he finds reprehensible, at the end of which he calls Brian \\"a big, sad, alcoholic bore\\". Brian then returns home, having been crying on the way back. Stewie cheers him up by saying that he only needs to like himself, and then professes his own admiration for Brian by letting him spend the night in his room. Production and development Kevin Michael Richardson provided the voice of Jerome. First announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by series regular John Viener, and directed by Brian Iles before the conclusion of the eighth production season.

Voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who portrayed Jerome in the episode, based the character largely on his role as Rockefeller Butts on the short- lived ABC comedy series The Knights of Prosperity. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Danny Smith, Seth MacFarlane and David Zuckerman serving as staff writers for the episode. In addition to the regular cast and Richardson, actress Nana Visitor briefly appeared as a crying woman in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Cultural references Actor Kevin Connolly was briefly referenced in the episode. In the opening scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown watching television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter then goes on to express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal. At one point Peter suggests Jerome grab his nephew and \\"shoot people in the D.C. area\\" in reference to the Beltway sniper attacks. Feeling sorry for Jerome, Lois invites him to stay at their home, with Peter reluctantly agreeing, before suddenly being cut off mid-sentence by the Mac OS X spinning wait cursor. The next day, after Jerome decides to cook for Lois, Peter and Chris, sitting in the other room, overhear Lois passionately complimenting Jerome, and believe they are having sex. Racing to the kitchen, the two discover that she was only complimenting his food, with Don Knotts as Ralph Furley from the sitcom Three's Company also appearing. Attempting to win over Quagmire, Brian decides to invite him to dinner, using model and actress Cheryl Tiegs as bait. Soon discovering the invitation to be fake, Quagmire is crushed, causing Brian to suggest that they can be a better team than Lewis and Clark, and a third member who enjoyed \\"ripping up maps.\\" After Jerome is convinced to leave by Peter, Lois reveals a gift from Jerome of an original garbage structure made by character Nick Moore from the sitcom Family Ties, the show Jerome had been watching earlier when Peter was spying on him.

Club's Emily VanDerWerff commented that she thought the episode \\"started out well before sort of just petering out as the episode went on,\\" comparing it to South Park's attempt to replace Kenny McCormick, before ultimately reintroducing the character into the series. In the conclusion of her review, VanDerWerff praised Quagmire's monologue, commenting \\"it's certainly amusing that the show is spending all of this time tearing down the one character who's a mouthpiece for the creator.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN criticized the episode for its \\"execution,\\" stating, \\"Auditioning friends to replace Cleveland seemed like a better idea on paper.\\" Haque praised Quagmire's tirade against Brian, however, as \\"completely unexpected\\" and \\"mildly amusing,\\" but ultimately gave the episode a 6.4 out of 10. In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed \\"Jerome Is the New Black\\" as \\"remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing.\\" References External links  Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 8) episodes ","title":"Jerome Is the New Black"},{"id":"24700096","text":"Heshan District () is a district of the city of Hebi, Henan province, China.

The 13th five-year plan of Xinyang City proposes to support the withdrawal of Huangchuan County to apply for the construction of Guangzhou City, build a sub central city in the city area, and accelerate the integrated development of Huangchuan and Guangshan. History Origin and early development According to the ancient Chinese text Bamboo Annals, Huangchuan was the national capital of the first Kingdom of Huang in the Xia dynasty during the 21st century BCE. Later, in the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, a second and separate Kingdom of Huang was founded by King Huang Huilian, and he re-established his national capital in Huangchuan like his early predecessor in the Xia dynasty. His name Huang is considered to be the root origin of the royal ancient Chinese surname Huang (or Hwang). The Kingdom of Huang was later invaded and annexed by the Kingdom of Chu and became a vassal state under the Zhou dynasty in 648 BCE, during the Spring and Autumn period. Remains of the capital of the Kingdom of Huang were discovered in Longgu, a township six kilometers northwest to the urban area of Huangchuan. Empire period After the Qin dynasty. Huangchuan was generally established as a zhou, a commandery or a county. According to Brief Sketch of North Parts of Ming Dynasty (), a book by Ji Liuqi () recording the transitional period from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty, Huangchuan (then Guangzhou) was devastated and the residents massacred by the peasant army. And now residents in Huangchuan are mainly descendants of migrants from Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong settled down during the Kangxi era in the Qing dynasty. Republic period In 1913, Huangchuan was renamed to its current name. In 2009, Huang-Guang Integration project was launched aiming to integrate Huangchuan County and neighboring Guangshan County. Former names   Geography Huangchuan borders the Huai River in the north, which is regarded as part of the geographical dividing line between North China and South China. Huang River, a tributary of Huai River, is pronounced the same as Yellow River yet with different characters. Local residents usually call it Little Huang River ().

The Southern Song Dynasty is divided into the county of Baocheng County, which belongs to Yiyang County. Nanqi was changed to Baocheng as Baocheng, which belongs to Beiyiyang County. In the Northern Wei Dynasty, Baocheng County, Qi County, and Dongsui County were placed. Baocheng County and Qi County belong to Qi'an County. North Qihe County is located in Gao'an County, still in Qi'an County. In the third year of the Kaihuang Emperor (583 years), Gao'an County was merged into Zhongshan County. In the 16th year of Kaihuang (596), it was analyzed that Zhongshan County was located in Luoshan County and belonged to Yiyang County. Because of the southwest of the county, there is Xiaoluo Mountain, hence the name. Tang Wude four years (612 years) set South Luozhou, led Luoshan County. Wude eight years (625 years) South Luozhou waste, Luoshan County is Shenzhou. Five generations with the Tang system. Song Kaibao nine years (976 years) Luoshan County waste. In the third year of the reign of Emperor Xixi (986), it belonged to Xinyang Army. In the 20th year of Yuanzhiyuan (1283), Xinyang Prefecture was reorganized in Luoshan County. The former Luoshan County moved to the southwest, and it was called Luoshan New County. It belonged to Xinyang Prefecture of Suining. In the first year of Ming Hongwu (1368), the county was restored to the old, still known as Luoshan County, belonging to Xinyang Prefecture. In the 7th year of Hongwu (1374), it was changed to Suining. Chenghua Decade (1475) is a copy of Xinyang Prefecture. Luoshan in the Qing Dynasty belonged to Suining. In the 2nd year of the Republic of China (1913), the waste state was changed to the county, and Luoshan County belonged to Henan South Road, and later changed to Xiangyang Road. In the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), it was abolished and directly under Henan Province. In 17 years (1928), Henan Province was divided into 14 administrative districts, and Luoshan was the seventh (Xinyang) Inspector Administrative Region. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), it was assigned to the ninth (Huangchuan) administrative inspectorate of Henan Province. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), it was analyzed in the southern part of the county. It was newly established in Lishan County, Hubei Province, now Dawu County. In March 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army occupied Luoshan, belonging to the Huangchuan area. In 1952, the Huangchuan area was merged into the Xinyang area, and Luoshan was merged.

In addition, the PTB provides charter buses and sightseeing services.Bermuda Public Transportation Board: Bus Fare Information History Buses were introduced to Bermuda in 1945 by the Bermuda Omni Bus Service, a division of the Bermuda Railway Service. The railway system closed in 1948. The Public Transportation Board was created in 1946 and operates all bus services. Buses, the backbone of the island's public transportation system, are supplemented by a public ferry service. Buses Bermuda buses are specifically designed for the peculiarities of the island, being narrow enough to navigate the Bermuda roads. They have no provisions for transport of luggage, bicycles, or golf bags. Sightseeing buses are also provided by the Board. MAN manufactures the diesel buses, and Berkhof outfits them as coaches. Bermuda received 15 new low-floor buses in March 2009. These buses have 32‚Äì34 seats, fewer than the older buses, but allow wheelchair access. The livery of all buses is pink and blue recalling the colors of the Bermuda beaches. Fares and operations Bermuda is divided in 14 fare zones of about 2 miles length and fares are based on the number of zones travelled. Buses require exact fare in local currency, tokens, or prepaid tickets; transfers are available. Single- or multiple-day transportation passes, accepted on buses and ferries, can be purchased. Children under age five ride free, and at age 5‚Äì15 pay a reduced rate. Buses run typically between 7 am and 11 pm at variable (often 15-minute) intervals. Schedules assume an average speed of . Bus stops, many of which are sheltered, are marked by pink (direction towards Hamilton) or blue (direction away from Hamilton) poles. Buses stop by them at request.

He still wished to continue running and began at the Brownfield High School track. This is where he came in contact with James Morris the Brownfield High School track coach. They became friends and decided to start a running club in the area. Because Brownfield was a small community they decided to make their running club appeal to runners throughout the West Texas region. During the Summer of 1972 at the Brownfield Firecracker Race Gene and James convinced a few other runners to join their club. The WTRC organized its first race shortly thereafter.

It takes a close look at growing water problems worldwide, such as access to clean water and sanitation, and the cross-cutting issues which affect them, such as energy, climate change, agriculture, and urban growth. The Report also offers recommendations on how freshwater resources could be managed more sustainably. The content of the Report comes from the coordinated efforts of 26 UN agencies that make up UN-Water, working with governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders.http://www.unwater.org/documents.html In 2018, the topic of the report was \\"Nature-based Solutions for Water\\". In 2017, the topic of the report was \\"Wastewater: The Untapped Resource\\". Background In 1998, the Sixth Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development stated that there was a need for regular, global assessments on the status of freshwater resources. In response to this recommendation, the member organizations of UN- Water (known then as the ACC Subcommittee on Water Resources) decided to produce a World Water Development Report every three years, with an aim to reporting on the status of global freshwater resources and the progress achieved in reaching the Millennium Development Goals related to water.External Evaluation of UNESCO's Contribution to the World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) Objectives The UN World Water Development Reports monitor changes in the world‚Äôs freshwater resources and their management. They track progress towards achieving international development targets, particularly those of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and offer best practices as well as in-depth theoretical analyses to help stimulate ideas and actions for better stewardship in the water sector. The WWDRs also include the findings of case study development projects initiated in different geographic regions of the world. The case studies provide an in- depth analysis of the state of freshwater resources and related challenges that directly affect the livelihoods of people in the societies.

Unlike the earlier Reports, which were structured along UN agency lines, ‚ÄúWater in a Changing World‚Äù took a holistic approach, addressing a number of themes throughout the report, such as climate change, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), groundwater, biodiversity, water and migration, water and infrastructure, and biofuels. The Report has four main sections, apart from the introduction and the recommendations: ‚Äúdrivers of change,‚Äù ‚Äúthe use of the resource for humans and for ecosystems,‚Äù ‚Äúthe state of the resource,‚Äù and ‚Äúresponding to a changing world: what are the options?‚Äù Case Studies: The third Report is accompanied by the first stand-alone volume of WWAP case studies, titled \\"Facing the Challenges\\", which includes 20 studies from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Latin America, where conditions of water-related stress and socio- economic settings vary widely. Case studies include the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain), Bangladesh, Cameroon, China, the Cholistan desert (Pakistan), Estonia, the Han River basin (Republic of Korea), Istanbul (Turkey), the Lake Mer√≠n basin (Brazil and Uruguay), La Plata River basin (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay), the Netherlands, Pacific island states, the Po River basin (Italy), Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, the Vuoksi River basin (Finland and the Russian Federation) and Zambia.http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3 Links to Report and related materials: :* UN World Water Development Report 3: \\"Water in a Changing World\\" and \\"Facing the Challenges\\" (2009) http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural- sciences/environment/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3-2009/downloads-wwdr3/ :* Facts and Figures [1.5 MB, full-color PDF] http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/WWDR3_Facts_and_Figures.pdf :* Messages http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/messages.shtml :* Side Publications Series http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/side_publications.shtml 2006: Water: A Shared Responsibility (2006) The second WWDR, ‚ÄúWater: A Shared Responsibility,‚Äù was presented in 2006 at the fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City, Mexico. Building on the conclusions of the first WWDR, the Report provides an assessment of freshwater resources in all regions and most countries of the world as it tracks progress towards the water-related targets of the UN Millennium Development Goals. It examines a range of key issues including population growth and increasing urbanization, changing ecosystems, food production, health, industry and energy, as well as risk management, valuing and paying for water and increasing knowledge and capacity. Sixteen case studies look at typical water resource challenges and provide valuable insights into different facets of the water crisis and management responses. Finally, the report outlines a set of conclusions and recommendations to guide future action and encourage sustainable use, productivity and management of our increasingly scarce freshwater resources. Case studies: The second Report contains 16 case studies, including the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain), the Danube River Basin (Albania, Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Republic of Macedonia,Referred to by the United Nations as \\"The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\\" due to the Macedonia naming dispute.

It was in operation from 1949 to 1967. History In 1947, a proposal to form an airline in Aden using a pair of Bristol Wayfarers did not materialize. An engineering base was established by BOAC in Asmara, Eritrea, in January 1948 as part of BOACs No.5 Line, which was centered on Aden and served Cairo, Nairobi and the Red Sea area. On 7 March 1949, Aden Airways Ltd was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of BOAC. A fleet of six BOAC Douglas DC-3 aircraft were based at Aden and these were taken over by Aden Airways. Operations commenced on 1 October 1949 with the aircraft operating under their United Kingdom (G-) registrations. On 1 February 1950, the aircraft were placed on the Aden (VR-A) register. Vickers Viscount 760 of Aden Airways, operated from 1963 until 1967 On 31 March 1950, share capital of Rs.800,580 (¬£60,043) was issued. BOAC owned all the shares. The ownership of the shares passed to Associated British Airlines (Middle East) Ltd in 1955 and B.O.A.C. Associated Companies in 1957. Aden Airways experienced a seasonal increase in passenger numbers due to the pilgrimage to Mecca. Extra aircraft were leased to cover these flights, notably Avro Yorks from Skyways in 1954 and 1955. On 28 February 1960, Aden Airways took delivery of their first Canadair C-4 Argonaut. A May 1960 order for Avro 748s was later cancelled. From 1 January 1962, Aden Airways entered into an agreement with East African Airways Corporation to pool services on the Aden - Nairobi route. In September 1963, the first turboprop Vickers Viscounts entered service. In 1967, the political situation in Aden was deteriorating and Aden Airways therefore ceased operations on 30 June 1967. Fleet Douglas DC-3 *Twelve different Douglas DC-3s (all were former military Dakotas or C-47s) were operated by the airline from 1950 until it closed in 1967. Canadair C-4 Argonaut G-ALHS in BOAC livery Three Argonauts were acquired from BOAC in 1960 and one from East African Airways. Another Argonaut was leased from Derby Airways. The three former BOAC aircraft were scrapped after serving with Aden Airways and the former East African Airways went to the United Kingdom in May 1964. Vickers Viscount *Two aircraft delivered to Aden Airways in September 1963. One aircraft was placed in storage in April 1967 and the other was destroyed by fire on 21 July 1967 after a bomb exploded while the aircraft was in quarantine. The bomb had been placed by National Liberation Front guerillas. (Search by c/n or registration using drop down menu box) One aircraft was also leased from Central African Airways. Avro York *A number of Avro Yorks were leased from Skyways in 1954 and 1955. Avro 748 *Two Avro 748s were ordered in May 1960. The order was cancelled in May 1962. Accidents and incidents *In October 1952, Douglas DC-3 VR-AAE was severely damaged in an accident when it landed on a road near Assouan, Egypt and hit a tree stump. The damaged aircraft was dismantled and transported to Heliopolis by barge and thence to Cairo, where it was repaired despite being declared a write-off and Aden Airways receiving ¬£30,000 in insurance money. *On 12 April 1964, Douglas DC-3 VR-AAM was written off at Hargeisa, Somalia with the loss of 15 lives. *On 26 March 1965, Douglas DC-3 VR-AAA was damaged beyond economic repair after it was groundlooped following a downwind landing at Hadibo Airport, Socotra, South Yemen. *On 22 November 1966, Douglas DC-3 VR- AAN crashed at Wadi Rabtah after a bomb on board exploded. The aircraft was on a flight from Mayfa'ah Airport to Aden International Airport. Thirty people were killed, amongst them Amir Mohammed bin Said, the Prime Minister of Wahidi. The bomb had been planted by his son, Ali. *On 30 June 1967, Vickers Viscount VR-AAV was damaged beyond economic repair at Aden International Airport when a bomb on board exploded. The aircraft was in quarantine at the time after an engine change.

In 1924, a reputable biographical dictionary of musicians called him 'one of the most renowned and esteemed singers of the last 50 years'.Arthur Eaglefield Hull (Ed.), A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London & Toronto 1924), 319. Along with his great contemporary Francesco Tamagno (1850‚Äì1905), he is the earliest Italian tenor to have left a representative legacy of acoustic recordings. Life & singing career Born of humble origins in Rome, \\"Cecco\\" Marconi worked as a carpenter during his youth. The promising quality of his voice came to the attention of a singing teacher, Ottavio Bartolini, who gave him his first lessons. Later, he studied with a much more prominent pedagogue, Venceslao Persichini, at the Rome Conservatory.M. Scott, The Record of Singing to 1914 (Duckworth 1977, London), 121-123. Persichini also taught Marconi's coevals Antonio Magini-Coletti (1855‚Äì1912) and Mattia Battistini (1856‚Äì1928)‚Äîboth of whom were baritones with outstanding voices and, like Marconi, international reputations. Marconi made his operatic debut in the Spanish capital of Madrid in 1878 at the Teatro Real, singing the title role in Faust by Charles Gounod. His debut was a success, and he was soon appearing regularly at Italy's premier opera house, La Scala, Milan, with lucrative summer seasons spent performing in South America, mainly at Buenos Aires. He also sang with distinction at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, for two seasons: 1883 and 1884. He was engaged to perform the United States, and in New York City in 1888, he appeared as the protagonist in the first American performances of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. He failed, however, to achieve a real success on this particular occasion because his lyric voice was not equal to the heavyweight dramatic demands of Otello's score, which had been written by Verdi to suit the more powerful tones of his stentorian rival Tamagno.Scott 1977. Thereafter, Marconi built his operatic career increasingly in Eastern Europe, singing often in Poland and Russia to considerable acclaim during the 1890s. While in Russia, he appeared at the imperial opera houses situated in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and added Anton Rubinstein's Nero and Peter Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin to his repertoire. Marconi's repertoire did not consist entirely of operas, however. He also participated in performances of such significant sacred works as Rossini's Stabat mater and the Verdi Requiem. Indeed, near the end of his career, he toured widely in the Requiem, performing as part of a regular quartet of singers which contained one other top-class artist, Francesco Navarini (1855-1923), who was considered to be the best Italian bass of the era. The operatic parts that Marconi undertook in Europe and the two American continents included the principal tenor roles in the following works: Lucrezia Borgia, Lucia di Lammermoor La favorita (all composed by Gaetano Donizetti), I Puritani (by Vincenzo Bellini), Un ballo in maschera, Rigoletto, La traviata and Aida (all by Verdi), La Gioconda (by Amilcare Ponchielli), Mefistofele (by Arrigo Boito), Ruy Blas (by Filippo Marchetti), L'Africaine and Les Huguenots (by Giacomo Meyerbeer) and Lohengrin (by Richard Wagner). Famed during the peak of his career for the silvery beauty of his singing, the ease of his high notes and the spontaneity of his interpretations, Marconi retained all his life a simplicity of character which endeared him to many admirers.Paraphrased from Eaglefield-Hull 1924. He made two sets of recordings, in 1903 (or 1904Scott states 1904, but variant Internet and CD liner-note sources offer 1903 for this session.) and 1907/08, for the Gramophone Company. Some of them, like Marconi's sweet-toned and finely structured version of Cielo e mar from La Gioconda and his stylish delivery of arias from Lucia di Lammermoor, successfully convey the limpidity and grace of his bel canto method of vocalism; but most of them demonstrate that by the age of 50, both his breath control and the sweetly lyrical timbre of his voice had been damaged by the strain of singing such taxing rolesScott 1977, 123. as Radames, Otello, Lohengrin and Don Alvaro. Marconi notably partnered Antonio Cotogni, an illustrious baritone and voice teacher from an earlier generation, in the only record that is known to have been made by Cotogni, the duet I Mulattieri.Scott 1977, 105. (Marconi and Cotogni were well known to each other: they had sung together, for instance, in London in the early 1880s, appearing in the same production of La Gioconda.) In 1990, the English firm Symposium Records issued a compact disc containing 22 of Marconi's recordings, including the duet with Cotogni. (The CD catalogue number of this Marconi collection is 1069; five more Marconi tracks are included on a later Symposium release, number 1073.) Discography Marconi's recordings were made for the Gramophone Company's Italian Catalogue,Derived from John R. Bennett (F.R.C.O.), Ed., Voices of the Past, Vol. II: A Catalogue of Vocal Recordings from the Italian Catalogues of the Gramophone Company Limited, etc. (Oakwood Press, 1967).

He was born in Jiangsu province, China. At his early education period, he studied with various prominent monks such as Master and Master Nanting from the Zhulin Buddhist Institute in Zhenjiang. He then pursues his study further at Minnan Buddhist Institute in Xiamen, and studied under renowned scholar-monk and modernist Master Taixu. His peers in the institute include Master Yinshun, Zhumo, and Cihang (Tzuhang) ‚Äì all of whom also became influential monks. After graduating from Minnan Buddhist Institute, Ven. Dongchu then became dean of the prestigious school Jiaoshan Buddhist Institute. At the same time, he was abbot of the Dinghui Monastery in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province. Dinghui Monastery (Monastery of Samadhi and Wisdom) was a very famous Ch'an monastery in China, it stands on an island in the Yangtze River, on a hill called Floating Jade Mountain. It was first built around 194-195 CE and changed names several times before finally became Dinghui Monastery during Qing Dynasty. He also taught classes at several other Buddhist institutes, including Jingan Si (Quiet Calm) Academy in Shanghai ‚Äì at which young Sheng-yen, who was studying there, first encountered him. Ven. Dongchu had a reputation as a progressive thinker who, unlike most monks at his time, would not hesitate to criticize others. He was also known as a fierce teacher and his students gave him the nickname the 'Big Gun'. His paradigm was much influence by his teacher, Taixu.Sheng Yen, Footprints in the Snow: The Autobiography of a Chinese Buddhist Monk. Doubleday Religion, 2008. . He also became the first permanent council member in the Buddhist Association of the Republic of China in 1947. But it did not last long as within the next couple of years, the Communist Party drove Nationalists out of the Mainland China, and many religious leaders, in fear of the Communists' persecution, fled overseas ‚Äì including Ven. Dongchu, who fled to Taiwan at 1949. He took temporary shelter at Beitou, near Taipei, at the Fazang Monastery. Three months later, his passion for Buddhist education and culture led him to start the Humanity Magazine ‚Äì the first Buddhist periodical in Taiwan. Its mission is to \\"purify the minds of the people and establish Life Buddhism.\\" By the early 1950s, it had grown very popular and its circulation reached Southeast Asia and East Asia, and the United States. Ven. Dongchu established his first monastery in Taiwan at 1955. It was located in Beitou, near Taipei, and was completed a year later. Instead of naming it a 'monastery', he named it Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture to establish a foundation for cultural work. In 1956, he started a charity program called 'Winter Relief Drive' to collect donations to buy rice, oil, and winter clothing for poor families and orphanages in Beitou, Tamsui, Sanchong, Yilan, Taoyuan, and Xinzhuang. Therefore, they could celebrate Chinese New Year with warmth and meal. Ven. Sheng-yen, who had been an active writer in the Humanity Magazine under his pen-name Xing Shi Jiang Jun (\\"World Awakening General\\"), became Ven. Dongchu's disciple in 1959. Ven. Sheng-yen was a soldier in the intelligence unit at that time, he joined the Army unwillingly in order to escape from Mainland China. Despite his position in the intelligence, Ven. Sheng-yen's request to be dismissed from his post was accepted by his superior with Ven. Dongchu's help. Aside from his intellectual and charity activities, Ven. Dongchu didn't spend much time leading Buddhist ceremonies or rituals. In his later years, he rarely went out to focus on his writings. Thus, he didn't have many followers and disciples. However, he was persistent and in the 1960s he bought a 2.5 acres of land in the Guandu Plain, near Taipei. Ven. Dongchu with his disciple Ven. Sheng-yen in the United States In the beginning it only serves as a farmland cultivated by Ven. Dongchu and his two disciples ‚Äì Ven. Sheng-yen was in solitary retreat at southern Taiwan by the time. Step by step, he built a farmhouse, and after four years of works, he succeeded to establish another monastery, Nung Chan Monastery in 1975. In Nung Chan, meaning Farming Ch'an, the residents practice Ch'an while grow their own food. They live by the famous aphorism by Zen Master Baizhang Huaihai, \\"A day without work is a day without food\\". The monastery was dedicated to Bodhisattva Manjusri, which symbolizes great wisdom. In 1976, Ven. Dongchu had a chance to visit his disciple Ven. Sheng-yen in New York. Ven. Sheng-yen was an abbot of a small monastery at the Bronx and he succeeded to gain a number of Western followers. They both had parted long before. Ven. Sheng-yen went to six-years solitary retreat in 1961. He then studied in Japan for some years and earned a doctorate degree before arriving in United States. Ven. Dongchu died in 1977 in sitting position with no clear illness. In his last will he passed down the abbotship of Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture and Nung Chan to Ven. Sheng-yen. His ashes, which were kept in Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture before, were buried in the Life Memorial Garden of Dharma Drum Mountain in 2007. The Chinese name of New York City's Ch'an Meditation Center () is named after Ven. Master Dongchu by his disciple Ven. Master Sheng-yen. References External links * Ven.

She was the center of a great social scandal when she married a non-noble against her family's consent. Her case caused a debate about the law for marriage between nobles and non-nobles.  Biography  She was the daughter of statesman and marshal Count Gabriel Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (d. 1673) and Countess Maria Christiana von L√∂wenstein und Scharfeneck (d. 1672; in turn she was the only surviving daughter of Countess Elisabeth Juliana of Erbach ‚Äìlater wife of the Swedish Field Marshal Johan Ban√©r‚Äì in her first marriage) and sister of Count Gustaf Adolf Oxenstierna. As an orphan, she was taken care of by her paternal aunt, Countess Anna af Dohna. The vicar (since 1687) of the French Lutheran church in Stockholm, Nikolaus Bergius, was lodged in the palace of Dohna. Bergius suffered from severe depression and Dohna asked her niece to comfort him. Oxenstierna and Bergius fell in love and Bergius proposed, but Oxenstierna declined, as she knew she would be an outcast from her family and the nobility if she consented. Her family found out and banned every plans of a marriage. Bergius was separated from her in 1688‚Äì89. Their relationship was eventually taken up again. After a priest had agreed to conduct the ceremony, Oxenstierna and Bergius were married in 1691. The marriage was kept a secret, and she remained with her unknowing family. In 1692, she became pregnant; she moved to her spouse, and everything was made public. It became a great scandal. Her family contested the legality of the marriage, and her brother, the count, reported them to Hovr√§tten, to the Swedish House of Lords and presented the monarch with an appeal to bring the couple to court for committing a criminal act by breaking: > \\"common law, guardian law, noble privileges, the law of the church as well > as Your Majesty‚Äôs law of illegal marriages\\", by: \\"having dared to harm the > rank of nobility by such a illegal act, in the Kingdom as well as abroad, > and damaging its privileges, of such a degree that, if it is not made an > example of, would unavoidably have the scandalous effect to break the public > order, that a noblewoman, regardless of what kind, should be liberated.\\" He also suggested that the law should be enforced against marriages between nobles and non-nobles (1693). Christiana Oxenstierna replied to her brother: > \\"If You wish Your hatred and persecution to last as long as our lives, so it > will; You will with no doubt be spared the burden soon enough and harm > Yourself as much as others; I will not loose a thing thereby. If You will be > as a Christian, it will be as dear to me as the wish that you will give your > children treasures which rust and moths can not alter, and that we will one > day meet were a Count and a master Bergius will weigh as much.\\" The court of the Swedish House of Lords made the verdict that a serious crime had been committed, but as the King had commented that the matter was but a private affair, the case was not pursued further. She broke off her contact with her family and the nobility and spent the rest of her life with her spouse, spending her time as a teacher for poor children. In 1701, she died in childbirth, giving her spouse all her assets in her will, because their four children (three sons and a daughter) all died in infancy.Grevliga √§tten Oxenstierna af Korsholm och Wasa in: adelsvapen.com (in Swedish) [retrieved 16 February 2016]. Her family demanded she be buried discreetly, and denied her a place in her father's crypt, but as she was the only person to have repaired and taken care of the crypt, her right to be buried there could not be denied. At her funeral, \\"Two Countesses Oxenstierna and one Miss Ban√©r as well as other noblewomen prepared her corpse and lifter her with their own hands in to the coffin\\".  In culture  In 1704, as a reply to the debate and slander which were still very much alive about her controversial person, her former spouse published her biography: Kort Beskrifning af then H√∂gw√§lborna Frus, Fru Christina Juliana Oxenstiernas Lefwernes Lopp (A description of the life of the honorable lady, lady Christina Juliana Oxenstierna) (1704).

He was sentenced to death by electrocution, which was commuted to life in prison after the death penalty was abolished in the 1970s. This began a long battle for parole, which continued until his release from prison in 2002. Trantino grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He was expelled from school for truancy, became a drug addict in his early teens and served the remainder of his teen age years in jail for robbery.Ferretti, Fred. \\"An Inmate at Rahway Writes and Illustrates Two Books; He Turns to Art He Talk of His Life\\", The New York Times, March 4, 1973.

Gary Tedesco were dispatched to follow up on the call. Voto entered the bar ‚Äî leaving behind Tedesco, a probationary officer who could not carry a weapon ‚Äî and was immediately ambushed by Frank Falco and Thomas Trantino, who were there to celebrate a successful robbery. When Voto did not return, Tedesco went into the bar and was also ambushed. Both were tortured and killed execution style. Falco was shot while resisting arrest and killed in Manhattan by officers of the New York City Police Department.Voto / Tedesco Memorial, Lodi, New Jersey Police Department. Accessed October 15, 2009. On August 29, a funeral for the 21-year-old Tedesco was held at Our Lady of Mount Virgin Roman Catholic Church in Garfield, New Jersey and a separate service for 40-year-old Sgt. Voto was held at St. Joseph's Church in Lodi, with more than 1,000 officers representing 40 different departments in attendance, a memorial described as the largest such funeral in New Jersey police history. Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes flew in from Trenton, New Jersey to offer his condolences to the respective families. Arrest and conviction Trantino was placed under arrest after turning himself in at the East 22nd Street Station in Manhattan on August 28 after 66 hours in hiding; he was arraigned and the case was adjourned until September 17 with Trantino held in jail without bail. Trantino's attorney described both of the accused killers as \\"gentlemen\\", saying that Trantino had never killed anyone and that the half-Jewish, half-Italian Trantino was called \\"Rabbi Tom\\" because he was so kind to others.Slocum, John W. \\"1,000 POLICE JOIN IN LODI FUNERAL; Victims of Gunmen Buried as Town Mourns Citations Ordered Second Funeral Held Emotions Summed Up Trantino Arraigned 'I Held My Breath'\\", The New York Times, August 30, 1963.

In his summation at the February 1964 trial, held at the Bergen County Court House, prosecutor Guy W. Calissi said that Trantino had pistol whipped Sgt. Voto, forced him to undress and shot both Voto and Tedesco after the second officer entered the bar. Trantino's attorney argued that both officers had been shot and killed by Falco and that Trantino‚Äîwho had been previously jailed on a robbery charge and had a history of addiction to narcotics‚Äîhad been too drunk to have committed the crime. On February 19, 1964, the jury of seven men and women took 7 hours and 20 minutes to find Trantino guilty. The jury's decision not to recommend mercy had the consequence that the death sentence would be imposed. Trantino's attorney Albert S.

After New Jersey abolished the death penalty in the state in 1971, Trantino was sent to Rahway State Prison. While in prison at Rahway, Trantino pursued an interest in poetry and art. His paintings were described by The New York Times in a 1973 article as being reminiscent of Pablo Picasso. The firm of Alfred A. Knopf agreed to publish two books of his works. In 1974, Trantino was one of five prison inmates found to have organized an illegal mass meeting attended by 200 inmates in which the subject was believed to be criticism of the prison's administration. The group of 200 had started meeting and refused to disperse for 30 minutes after guards ordered them to end the meeting, citing the explosive security risk arising from such a gathering.

Parole Trantino's sentence had been commuted on January 17, 1972, to a single life sentence, which would make him eligible for parole in 1977, after serving 15 years in jail. Under the Parole Act of 1979, the parole board could require the sentencing judge to set restitution as a condition of parole, with Trantino being the first case under the law after two previous parole applications had failed. The New Jersey State Parole Board was willing to release him once arrangements were made for making restitution to the survivors and Judge Theodore Trautwein took responsibility for setting the amounts as the original sentencing judge had retired ten years earlier. In September 1980, 500 police officers protested at the steps of the Court House in Hackensack, joining the families of the slain officers in arguing that Trantino should remain in jail and that compensation would not be accepted in exchange for the deaths of the two police officers.Hanley, Robert. \\"500 Protest Parole of Killer of Two Officers; Sentence Was Commuted to Life Intent of Law Is Explained 500 in Bergen Protest Parole of the Murderer Of Two Police Officers\\", The New York Times, September 1980.

Legend has it that this hill was a gathering place for celebrating peace or war victories. Location Namirembe is bordered by Makerere to the north-east, Old Kampala to the east, Mengo to the south-east, Lubaga to the south-west, Lungujja to the west, the Kasubi Tombs to the north- west, and Naankulabye to the north. The distance, by road, from the central business district of Kampala to Namirembe is approximately .

St. Paul's Cathedral Namirembe Namirembe Hill has been the location of the main Anglican place of worship in Buganda since Bishop Alfred Tucker established the offices of the Diocese of Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1890. Namirembe is the location of St. Paul's Cathedral Namirembe. This was the main place of worship of the Anglican Church in Uganda from completion of its construction in 1919 until the 1960s when the cathedral became the seat of the Diocese of Namirembe. At that time, the headquarters of the Church of Uganda moved to All Saints Church in Nakasero but later on moved back to Namirembe. The Anglican Faith is the religion most closely associated with the Buganda Monarchy since the end of the religious wars of the 1890s. Overview The hill rises above sea level. It is adjacent to Mengo Hill, the seat of the Buganda government. The history of the two hills is intertwined, geographically, politically, and religiously. The 300-bed Mengo Hospital is a community hospital affiliated with the Church of Uganda. It is also known as Namirembe Hospital. It was the first hospital in Uganda and was started by Albert Ruskin Cook in May 1897. At the north-western base of Namirembe Hill are the Buganda royal burial grounds known as the Kasubi Tombs. It is here that the last four kings of Buganda have been buried. The Bulange Complex includes Buganda‚Äôs parliament building, known as the \\"Lukiiko\\", The complex is on Namirembe Hill, just across from Mengo Hill. The Mengo Palace on Mengo Hill is connected to the Bulange Complex by a straight road, about a mile long, called the \\"Kabaka Anjagala Road\\" (\\"The King Loves Me\\" in English). About halfway, the straight road is intersected by Lubaga Road. There is a roundabout for the use of ordinary travelers. However, there is a strait-way through the roundabout with a gate. That is for the exclusive use of the Kabaka when moving between the palace and the parliament building. Tradition forbids the king from going round the roundabout. He must travel straight when moving between the two locations.

It typically involves two languages that can affect one another in a bilingual speaker. An example of CLI is the influence of Korean on a Korean native speaker who is learning Japanese or French. Less typically, it could also refer to an interaction between different dialects in the mind of a monolingual speaker. CLI can be observed across subsystems of languages including pragmatics, semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology, phonetics, and orthography.Odlin, Terence (2003). \\"Cross-Linguistic Influence\\". The Handbook of Second Language Acquisition. Oxford: Blackwell. p. 437. Discussed further in this article are particular subcategories of CLI‚Äîtransfer, attrition, the complementarity principle, and additional theories.  History  The question of how languages influence one another within a bilingual individual can be addressed both with respect to mature bilinguals and with respect to bilingual language acquisition. With respect to bilingual language acquisition in children, there are several hypotheses that examine the internal representation of bilinguals' languages. Volterra and Taeschner proposed the Single System Hypothesis, which states that children start out with one single system that develops into two systems. This hypothesis proposed that bilingual children go through three stages of acquisition. * In Stage I there is a single lexicon that contains words from both languages, and there is a single syntactic system. Children in this stage will never have a translation equivalent for a word in the other language. Translation equivalents are two corresponding words in two separate languages with the same meaning. Also, it is common for the child to use two different languages in a single utterance. The syntactic rules are hard to define because of the lack of two-word and three-word utterances by the bilingual child. * In Stage II there are two lexicons, but there is one syntactic system. In addition, there is evidence for language separation because at this stage children become less likely to mix their languages. Across both languages, the same syntactic rules are applied. For example, Japanese has subject-object-verb word order (SOV), and English has subject- verb-object word order (SVO). An English-Japanese bilingual might apply only one of these word orders to all utterances, regardless of what language the utterance is in. * In Stage III there are two lexicons and two syntactic systems, with adult-like separation of the languages. When a child reaches this stage they are considered fully \\"bilingual.\\" In response to the Single System Hypothesis, a different hypothesis developed regarding the idea of two separate language systems from the very beginning. It was based on evidence of monolinguals and bilinguals reaching the same milestones at approximately the same stage of development.Cantone, K. (1999). Das Genus im Italienischen und Deutschen: Empirische Untersuchung zum bilingualen Erstspracherwerb. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Hamburg.M√ºller, Natascha (1990). \\"Developing two gender assignment systems simultaneously\\". J. Meisel. Two first languages. Early grammatical development in bilingual children: 194-243. For example, bilingual and monolingual children go through identical patterns of grammar development. This hypothesis, called the Separate Development Hypothesis, held the notion that the bilinguals acquiring two languages would internalize and acquire the two languages separately. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from lack of transfer and lack of acceleration.Paradis, Johanne; Genesee, Fred (1996). \\"Syntactic acquisition in bilingual children: Autonomous or interdependent?\\". Studies in Second Language Acquisition. 18: 1-25. Transfer is a grammatical property of one language used in another language. Acceleration is the acquisition of a feature in language A facilitating the acquisition of a feature in language B.Mishina-Mori, Satomi (2005). \\"Autonomous and interdependent development of two language systems in Japanese/English simultaneous bilinguals: Evidence from question formation\\". First Language. 25: 292-293 In a study of Dutch-English bilingual children, there were no instances of transfer across elements of morphology and syntactic development, indicating that the two languages developed separately from each other.De Houwer, Annick (1990). The acquisition of two languages from birth: A case study. Cambridge: CUP In addition, in a study of French- English bilingual children, there were no instances of acceleration because finiteness appeared much earlier in French than it did in English, suggesting that there was no facilitation of the acquisition of finiteness in English by acquisition in French. Under this hypothesis, bilingual acquisition would be equivalent to monolingual children acquiring the particular languages. In response to both the previous hypotheses mentioned, the Interdependent Development Hypothesis emerged with the idea that there is some sort of interaction between the two language systems in acquisition. It proposed that there is no single language system, but the language systems are not completely separate either. This hypothesis is also known as the Crosslinguistic Hypothesis, developed by Hulk and M√ºller. The Crosslinguistic Hypothesis states that influence will occur in bilingual acquisition in areas of particular difficulty, even for monolingual native language acquisition. It re-examined the extent of the differentiation of the language systems due to the interaction in difficult areas of bilingual acquisition.Hulk, Aafke; M√ºller, Natascha (2000). \\"Bilingual first language acquisition at the interface between syntax and pragmatics\\". Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 3: 227-244.M√ºller, Natascha; Hulk, Aafke (2001). \\"Crosslinguistic influence in bilingual language acquisition: Italian and French as recipient languages\\". Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 4: 1-53. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from delay, acceleration, and transfer in particular areas of bilingual language acquisition. Delay is the acquisition of a property of language A later than normally expected because of the acquisition of language B. CLI is seen when the child has a dominant language, such as Cantonese influencing English when Cantonese is the dominant language,Yip, Virginia; Matthews, Stephen (2006). \\"Assessing Language Dominance in Bilingual Acquisition: A Case for Mean Length Utterance Differentials\\". Language Assessment Quarterly. 3: 101-102. and it will only occur in certain domains. Below are the two proposals represented in the Crosslinguistic Hypothesis where CLI may occur. * It may occur where there is an interface. An interface, for example, could be between syntax and pragmatics of dislocations. Dislocations are a grammatical option in French under certain pragmatic conditions (e.g. Je l'aime, √ßa 'I like it, that'), which have been studied in French-English bilinguals positioning of the word that. French-English bilinguals make use of this device when they move that to a dislocated position of the periphery of the sentence in English. The placement of that was dislocated in English sentences because of the influence from French on English syntax. For example, French-English bilingual children may produce Is a big one this? instead of meaning to say Is this a big one? The children produced significantly more of these dislocations in English than monolingual English children.Notley, Anna (2005). Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 2005. Benjamins. pp. 231-234. * It may occur where is an overlap between two languages with language A allowing only one option and language B allowing two options. One option of language B overlaps with an option in language A. For example, French allows adjectives before and after a noun, but English only allows adjectives before the noun. There is an overlap in the correct placement of adjectives between these two languages, and there will be transfer, especially with postnominal adjectives in French. For example, French-English bilinguals might produce un blanc chien \\"a white dog\\" instead of un chien blanc \\"a dog white.\\"Nicoladis, Elena (2006). \\"Cross-linguistic transfer in adjective-noun strings by preschool bilingual children\\". Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 9: 17-26. Since the development of the Crosslinguistic Hypothesis, much research has contributed to the understanding of CLI in areas of structural overlap, directionality, dominance, interfaces, the role of input, and the role of processing and production. Transfer In linguistics, language transfer is defined by behaviorist psychologists as the subconscious use of behaviors from one language in another. In the Applied Linguistics field, it is also known as exhibiting knowledge of a native or dominant language (L1) in one that is being learned (L2). Transfer occurs in various language-related settings, such as acquiring a new language and when two languages or two dialects come into contact. Transfer may depend on how similar the two languages are and the intensity of the conversational setting. Transfer is more likely to happen if the two languages are in the same language family. It also occurs more at the beginning stages of L2 acquisition, when the grammar and lexicon are less developed. As the speaker's L2 proficiency increases, they will experience less transfer. Jacquelyn Schachter (1992) argues that transfer is not a process at all, but that it is improperly named. She described transfer as \\"an unnecessary carryover from the heyday of behaviorism.\\" In her view, transfer is more of a constraint on the L2 learners' judgments about the constructions of the acquired L2 language. Schachter stated, \\"It is both a facilitating and a limiting condition on the hypothesis testing process, but it is not in and of itself a process.\\" Language transfer can be positive or negative. Transfer between similar languages often yields correct production in the new language because the systems of both languages are similar. This correct production would be considered positive transfer. An example involves a Spanish speaker (L1) who is acquiring Catalan (L2). Because the languages are so similar, the speaker could rely on their knowledge of Spanish when learning certain Catalan grammatical features and pronunciation. However, the two languages are distinct enough that the speaker's knowledge of Spanish could potentially interfere with learning Catalan properly. Negative transfer (Interference) occurs when there are little to no similarities between the L1 and L2. It is when errors and avoidance are more likely to occur in the L2. The types of errors that result from this type of transfer are underproduction, overproduction, miscomprehension, and production errors, such as substitution, calques, under/overdifferentiation and hypercorrection.  Underproduction (Avoidance)  Underproduction as explained by Schachter (1974),Schachter, J. (1974), AN ERROR IN ERROR ANALYSIS1. Language Learning, 24: 205‚Äì214. doi:10.1111/j.1467-1770.1974.tb00502.x is a strategy used by L2 learners to avoid producing errors when using structures, sounds, or words which they are not confident about in the L2. Avoidance is a complex phenomenon and experts do not agree on its causes or exactly what it is. For example, Hebrew speakers acquiring English, may understand how the passive voice, 'a cake is made', works, but may prefer active voice, 'I make a cake,' thus avoiding the passive construction. Kellerman (1992) distinguishes three types of avoidance: (1) learners of the L2 make anticipations or know there is a problem with their construction and have a vague idea of the target construction, (2) the target is known by the L1 speaker, but it is too difficult to use in given circumstances; such as conversational topics that the L1 speaker may have a deficiency in or (3), the L1 speaker has the knowledge to correctly produce and use the L2 structure but is unwilling to use it because it goes against the norms of their behavior.  Overproduction  Overproduction refers to an L2 learner producing certain structures within the L2 with a higher frequency than native speakers of that language. In a study by Schachter and Rutherford (1979), they found that Chinese and Japanese speakers who wrote English sentences overproduced certain types of cleft constructions: * 'It is very unfortunate that...' and sentences that contained There are/There is which suggests an influence of the topic marking function in their L1 appearing in their L2 English sentences. French learners have been shown to over-rely on presentational structures when introducing new referents into discourse, in their L2 ItalianTurco, G. (2008). Introduction et identification d‚Äôun r√©f√©rent chez les apprenants francophones de l‚Äôitalien L2. Acquisition et interaction en langue √©trang√®re, 26, 211‚Äì237. and English.Leclercq, P. (2008). L‚Äôinfluence de la langue maternelle chez les apprenants adultes quasi- bilingues dans une tache contrainte de verbalization. Acquisition et interaction en langue √©trang√®re, 26, 51‚Äì69. This phenomenon has been observed even in the case of a target language where the presentational structure does not involve a relative pronoun, as Mandarin Chinese.Lena, L. (2020). Referent introducing strategies in advanced L2 usage: a bi-directional study on French learners of Chinese and Chinese learners of French. In Ryan, J., Crosthwaite, P. (Eds.). Referring in a Second Language. London: Routledge.  Production errors  Substitution is when the L1 speaker takes a structure or word from their native language and replaces it within the L2. Odlin (1989) shows a sentence from a Swedish learner of English in the following sentence. * Swedish Structure on English: ** But sometimes I must go bort. Here the Swedish word bort has replaced its English equivalent away. * Polish learner of English: ** English think pronounced as [fink] because of the influence of the Polish accent on English pronunciation. A Calque is a direct \\"loan translation\\" where words are translated from the L1 literally into the L2. * English skyscraper literally translates in French as gratte-ciel (\\"scrapes- sky\\") * Polish palec srodkowy literally translates to a finger middle in English. * Scottish Gaelic \\"a' coimhead air adhart\\" (literal translation of \\"looking forwards\\"), c.f. native expression, \\"Tha fiughair agam ris\\" (\\"I have anticipation of it\\") Overdifferentiation occurs when distinctions in the L1 are carried over to the L2. * An English L1 learner of Polish applies different vowel lengths of English (e.g. /i/ and /i:/) to their Polish due to the use of vowel distinctions in English. Underdifferentiation occurs when speakers are unable to make distinctions in the L2. * A Polish learner of English assumes the words borrow and lend are equivalent in meaning, since both correspond to po≈ºyczyƒá in Polish. * Scottish Gaelic learners whose first language was English pronounce the phonemes /lÃ™À†/, /l/, and / é/ identically, since English has only one lateral phoneme. Hypercorrection is a process where the L1 speaker finds forms in the L2 they consider to be important to acquire, but these speakers do not properly understand the restrictions or exceptions to formal rules that are in the L2, which results in errors, such as the example below. * Polish speakers of English may say: potato pronounced as [pota:to] paralleled tomato [toma:to]  Attrition  Also related to the idea of languages interfering with one another is the concept of language attrition. Language attrition, simply put, is language loss. Attrition can occur in an L1 or an L2. According to the Interference Hypothesis (also known as the Crosslinguistic Influence Hypothesis), language transfer could contribute to language attrition. If a speaker moved to a country where their L2 is the dominant language and the speaker ceased regular use of their L1, the speaker could experience attrition in their L1. However, second language attrition could just as easily occur if the speaker moved back to a place where their L1 was the dominant language, and the speaker did not practice their L2 frequently. Attrition could also occur if a child speaker's L1 is not the dominant language in their society. A child whose L1 is Spanish, but whose socially dominant language is English, could experience attrition of their Spanish simply because they are restricted to using that language in certain domains. Much research has been done on such speakers, who are called heritage language learners. When discussing CLI, attrition is an important concept to keep in mind because it is a direct result of two or more languages coming into contact and the dominance of one over the other resulting in language loss in a speaker. Complementarity principle Grosjean (1997) explained the complementarity principle as the function of language use in certain domains of life leading to language dominance within that domain for a given speaker.Grosjean, F. (1997). The bilingual individual. Interpreting, 2(1/2), 163-187 This dominance in certain domains of life (e.g. school, home, work, etc.) can lead to apparent Crosslingusitic Influence within a domain. One study found that CLI was occurring within the speech of the studied bilinguals, but the intensity of influence was subject to the domains of speech being used.Auer, Peter, and Li Wei. Handbook of Multilingualism and Multilingual Communication. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2009. Print. Argyri and Sorace (2007) found, much like many other researchers, that language dominance plays a role in the directionality of CLI.Argyri, Efrosyni; Sorace, Antonella (2007).Crosslinguistic influence and language dominance in older bilingual children. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 10(1), 79-99. These researchers found that the English dominant bilinguals had an influence of English on their Greek (concerning preverbal subjects specifically, but also the language in general), but not from their Greek to their English. On the other hand, the Greek dominant bilinguals did not show evidence of Greek influence on their English. This supports the notion that bilinguals who do not receive sufficient exposure to both languages acquire a \\"weaker language\\" and a \\"dominant language,\\" and depending on similarities or differences between the languages, effects can be present or absent like that of the Greek-English example above. The effect of CLI can be primarily seen as a unidirectional occurrence, in that the L2 is likely to be affected by the L1, or simply the dominant language is more likely to affect the weaker, than the reverse. This supports the idea of individuals' susceptibility to crosslinguistic influences and the role of dominance. Take for example bilinguals who use different languages for different domains in their life; if a Spanish-English bilingual primarily uses Spanish in the home, but English in school you would expect to see English influences while speaking about school topics in Spanish and similarly you would expect Spanish influences on English when speaking about the home in English because in both instances the language being used is weaker in that domain. This is to say that not only do you see CLI from one language to another, but depending on the domains of use and the degree of proficiency or dominance, CLI can be a significant influence on speech production. Additional theories Some researchers believe that CLI may be a result of \\"contact-modified input,\\" or linguistic input modified or affected by some other source such as another language.Hauser-Gr√ºdl, N., Guerra, L. A., Witzmann, F., Leray, E., & M√ºller, N. (2010). Cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children: Can input frequency account for it? Lingua, 120(11), 2638-2650. doi:10.1016/j.lingua.2010.06.008 This is to say that the environment surrounding the learning of another language can influence what is actually being learned. Take for example the fact that most L2 learners are receiving input or teachings from similarly speaking bilinguals; Hauser-Gr√ºdl, Guerra, Witzmann, Leray, and M√ºller (2010) believe that the language being taught has already been influenced by the other in the teachers' minds and, therefore, the input the learner is receiving will exhibit influence. These L2 learners will replicate influences because their input of the L2 is not as pure as input from a monolingual; meaning, what appears as CLI in the individual isn't really CLI of their L1 on their L2, but the effects of acquiring input that has already been modified. This theory has led some people to believe that all input for L2 learning will be affected and resemble CLI; however, this is not a well-supported theory of CLI or its function in L2 acquisition. Other researchers believe that CLI is more than production influences, claiming that this linguistic exchange can impact other factors of a learner's identity. Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008) described such affected areas as experiences, knowledge, cognition, development, attention and language use, to name a few, as being major centers for change because of CLI.Jarvis, S., & Pavlenko, A. (2008). Crosslinguistic influence in language and cognition. London: Routledge. These ideas suggest that crosslinguistic influence of syntactic, morphological, or phonological changes may just be the surface of one language's influence on the other, and CLI is instead a different developmental use of one's brain. Future research CLI has been heavily studied by scholars, but there is still much more research needed because of the multitude of components that make up the phenomenon. Firstly, the typology of particular language pairings needs to be researched to differentiate CLI from the general effects bilingualism and bilingual acquisition. Also, research is needed in specific areas of overlap between particular language pairings and the domains that influence and discourage CLI. For example, most of the research studies involve European language combinations, and there is a significant lack of information regarding language combinations involving non- European languages, indigenous languages, and other minority languages. More generally, an area of research to be further developed are the effects of CLI in multilingual acquisition of three or more languages. There is limited research on this occurrence.

The inequality is named after the mathematicians George P√≥lya and G√°bor Szeg≈ë.  Mathematical setting and statement  Given a Lebesgue measurable function u:\\\\R^n\\\\to \\\\R^+,the symmetric decreasing rearrangement u^*:\\\\R^n\\\\to \\\\R^+, is the unique function such that for every t \\\\in \\\\R, the sublevel set u^*{}^{-1}((t, +\\\\infty)) is an open ball centred at the origin 0 \\\\in \\\\R^n that has the same Lebesgue measure as u^{-1}((t, +\\\\infty)). Equivalently, u^* is the unique radial and radially nonincreasing function, whose strict sublevel sets are open and have the same measure as those of the function u. The P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality states that if moreover u \\\\in W^{1,p}(\\\\R^n), then u^* \\\\in W^{1,p}(\\\\R^n) and : \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u^*|^p \\\\leq \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u|^p.  Applications of the inequality  The P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality is used to prove the Rayleigh‚ÄìFaber‚ÄìKrahn inequality, which states that among all the domains of a given fixed volume, the ball has the smallest first eigenvalue for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The proof goes by restating the problem as a minimization of the Rayleigh quotient. The isoperimetric inequality can be deduced from the P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality with p = 1. The optimal constant in the Sobolev inequality can be obtained by combining the P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality with some integral inequalities.  Equality cases  Since the Sobolev energy is invariant under translations, any translation of a radial function achieves equality in the P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality. There are however other functions that can achieve equality, obtained for example by taking a radial nonincreasing function that achieves its maximum on a ball of positive radius and adding to this function another function which is radial with respect to a different point and whose support is contained in the maximum set of the first function. In order to avoid this obstruction, an additional condition is thus needed. It has been proved that if the function u achieves equality in the P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality and if the set \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n : u (x) > 0 \\\\text{ and } abla u (x) = 0\\\\\\\\} is a null set for Lebesgue's measure, then the function u is radial and radially nonincreasing with respect to some point a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n.  Generalizations  The P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality is still valid for symmetrizations on the sphere or the hyperbolic space. The inequality also holds for partial symmetrizations defined by foliating the space into planes (Steiner symmetrization) and into spheres (cap symmetrization). There are also P√≥lya‚àíSzeg≈ë inequalities for rearrangements with respect to non-Euclidean norms and using the dual norm of the gradient.  Proofs of the inequality   Original proof by a cylindrical isoperimetric inequality  The original proof by P√≥lya and Szeg≈ë for p = 2 was based on an isoperimetric inequality comparing sets with cylinders and an asymptotics expansion of the area of the area of the graph of a function. The inequality is proved for a smooth function u that vanishes outside a compact subset of the Euclidean space \\\\R^n. For every \\\\varepsilon > 0, they define the sets :\\\\begin{align} C_\\\\varepsilon &= \\\\\\\\{ (x, t) \\\\in \\\\R^n \\\\times \\\\R \\\\, : \\\\, 0 < t < \\\\varepsilon u (x) \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_\\\\varepsilon^* &= \\\\\\\\{ (x, t) \\\\in \\\\R^n \\\\times \\\\R \\\\, : \\\\, 0 < t < \\\\varepsilon u^* (x)\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} These sets are the sets of points who lie between the domain of the functions \\\\varepsilon u and \\\\varepsilon u^* and their respective graphs. They use then the geometrical fact that since the horizontal slices of both sets have the same measure and those of the second are balls, to deduce that the area of the boundary of the cylindrical set C_\\\\varepsilon^* cannot exceed the one of C_\\\\varepsilon. These areas can be computed by the area formula yielding the inequality :\\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} ((0,+\\\\infty))} 1 + \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 abla u^*|^2}\\\\le \\\\int_{u^{-1} ((0,+\\\\infty))} 1 + \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 abla u|^2}. Since the sets u^{-1} ((0, +\\\\infty)) and u{}^*{}^{-1} ((0, +\\\\infty)) have the same measure, this is equivalent to :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} ((0, +\\\\infty))} \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 abla u^*|^2} - 1 \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\int_{u^{-1} ((0, +\\\\infty))} \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 abla u|^2} - 1. The conclusion then follows from the fact that :\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\int_{u^{-1} ((0, +\\\\infty))} \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 abla u|^2} - 1 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u|^2.  Coarea formula and isoperimetric inequality  The P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality can be proved by combining the coarea formula, H√∂lder‚Äôs inequality and the classical isoperimetric inequality. If the function u is smooth enough, the coarea formula can be used to write :\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u |^p = \\\\int_0^{+\\\\infty} \\\\int_{u^{-1} ({t})} abla u ^{p - 1} \\\\, d \\\\mathcal{H}^{n - 1} \\\\, dt, where \\\\mathcal{H}^{n-1} denotes the (n-1)‚Äìdimensional Hausdorff measure on the Euclidean space \\\\R ^n. For almost every each t \\\\in (0, +\\\\infty), we have by H√∂lder's inequality, :\\\\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\left(u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right) \\\\le \\\\left(\\\\int_{u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} abla u ^{p - 1}\\\\right )^\\\\frac{1}{p} \\\\left(\\\\int_{u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u } \\\\right )^{1 - \\\\frac{1}{p}}. Therefore, we have :\\\\int_{u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} abla u ^{p-1} \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{H}^{n - 1} \\\\left(u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right )^p}{\\\\left(\\\\int_{u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u}\\\\right)^{p - 1}}. Since the set u^*{}^{-1} ((t, +\\\\infty)) is a ball that has the same measure as the set u^{-1} ((t, +\\\\infty)), by the classical isoperimetric inequality, we have :\\\\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\left( u^*{}^{-1}(\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right) \\\\le \\\\mathcal{H}^{n - 1} \\\\left( u^{-1}(\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right). Moreover, recalling that the sublevel sets of the functions u and u^* have the same measure, :\\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u^*} = \\\\int_{u^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u}, and therefore, :\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u |^p \\\\ge \\\\int_0^{+\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\left (u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right)^p}{\\\\left(\\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u^*}\\\\right)^{p-1}}\\\\,dt. Since the function u^* is radial, one has :\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\left(u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})\\\\right)^p} {\\\\left(\\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} \\\\frac{1}{abla u^*}\\\\right)^{p-1}} = \\\\int_{u^*{}^{-1} (\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\})} abla u^*^{p - 1}, and the conclusion follows by applying the coarea formula again.  Rearrangement inequalities for convolution  When p=2, the P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality can be proved by representing the Sobolev energy by the heat kernel. One begins by observing that :\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u|^2 = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left (\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} |u|^2 - \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} K_t (x-y) u(x) u(y) \\\\,dx \\\\,dy\\\\right ), where for t \\\\in (0, +\\\\infty), the function K_t : \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\R is the heat kernel, defined for every z \\\\in \\\\R^n by :K_t (z) = \\\\frac{1}{(4 \\\\pi t)^\\\\frac{n}{2}} e^{-\\\\frac{|z|^2}{4t}}. Since for every t \\\\in (0, + \\\\infty) the function K_t is radial and radially decreasing, we have by the Riesz rearrangement inequality : \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} K_t (x - y)\\\\, u (x)\\\\, u (y) \\\\, dx \\\\,dy \\\\le \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} K_t (x-y)\\\\, u^*(x)\\\\, u^*(y) \\\\, dx \\\\,dy Hence, we deduce that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u|^2 &= \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left (\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} |u|^2 - \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} K_t (x-y) u(x) u(y) \\\\, dx \\\\,dy\\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &\\\\ge \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left (\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} |u|^2 - \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\int_{\\\\R^n} K_t (x-y) u^*(x) u^*(y) \\\\, dx \\\\,dy\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} abla u^*|^2. \\\\end{align} References Category:Sobolev spaces Category:Geometric inequalities Category:Rearrangement inequalities ","title":"P√≥lya‚ÄìSzeg≈ë inequality"},{"id":"24701093","text":"Agust√≠n Calder√≥n, (born March 27, 1972) is a Spanish sprint canoer who competed in the mid-1990s.

This changed in the 1950s when the national the Chinese government encouraged plantation of rice and built many dams in the lake. The area of Dongting Lake shrank dramatically. Owing to the river network in this district, a land transportation system was underdeveloped. The YuanJiang river splits the county into two parts, the so-called west lake region and the downtown region of Hanshou. Due to this fact, people from west lake region used to take a whole day to come all the way to the downtown because there was no bridge across the river, and cars and travelers have to count on the ferry to cross Yuan Jiang. In 2008, the YuanJiang Grand Bridge was constructed alleviating transportation across the river.

Rice, cotton, canola oil, green ramie, Italian aspens, various fishes from the Dongting lake, fleshes are the major products in the county. The settle-in of Zoomlion industrial park is deemed as a milestone for the industry development in this county. It brings as well a large number of jobs to this region. Raw agricultural products are processed by some local companies and exported abroad, for example, onions are cooked and canned to export to Japan by private JiaodeChang, Italian aspens are fabricated by private Guozhen Wooden Co. into shining fire-resistant wedge joint board for house construction in North America. Other state-owned factories such as paper-making company, spinning mill went into bankruptcy several years ago due to environmental pollutions, corruption and low efficiency to compete in the market. Industry in this country is developing gradually with vast configuration change. The eastern part of the county is protected by the state law as a wet land conservation area. Thousands of acres of reeds sprawl across the wet land. Thanks to the enforcement of state law, the ecological system is minimally disturbed by anthropogenic activities in the conservation area and hosts hundreds types of fishes, birds and wild animals.

The designation Patria del Friuli continued to be used ... during Venetian rule over Friuli.\\" (, ) was the territory under the temporal rule of the Patriarch of Aquileia and one of the ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1420, the Republic of Venice acquired it, but it continued to be ruled for some time under its own laws and customs.  Foundation  The former Duchy of Friuli in the Italian Kingdom of the Lombards had been conquered by Charlemagne in 774 and incorporated as a march of the Carolingian Empire. When in 952 King Otto I of Germany invaded Italy, he added the Friulian territory to the March of Verona, ruled by the Dukes of Bavaria, from 976 by the Dukes of Carinthia. During the Investiture Controversy of 1077, King Henry IV of Germany deposed the Veronese margrave Duke Berthold II of Carinthia, as he had sided with antiking Rudolf of Rheinfelden. On 3 April 1077 at Pavia Henry, on his way back from the Walk to Canossa, vested Patriarch Sieghard of Beilstein with immediate comital rights in the Friulian lands of Verona, raising him to the status of a Prince-Bishop. The remaining margraviate passed with the Carinthian duchy to Henry's vassal Liutold of Eppenstein. Sieghard in turn safely conducted the king across the Alps. Back in Germany, King Henry in addition nominally assigned the suzerainty over the marches of Carniola and Istria to the patriarchs as ecclesiastical Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The act, traditionally regarded as the birth of the ecclesiastical state of Aquileia, led to a long-running conflict with the rivaling margraves from the Carinthian House of Sponheim and the Andechs dukes of Merania.  Expansion  The Patriarchate subsequently extended its political control in the area: regions under Aquileian control in the following centuries included the Friulian lands up to Cadore, the city of Trieste and the central parts of the Istrian peninsula. At its maximum height, the Patriarchate of Aquileia was one of the largest states in Italy. Noblemen from the Patriarchate were participants in the Crusades. In 1186 Patriarch Godfrey crowned Frederick Barbarossa's son, Henry VI, as King of Italy: in retaliation, Pope Urban III deposed him. From 1127 the vogts at Gorizia from the Meinhardiner dynasty emerged from Aquileia, calling themselves Counts of G√∂rz. Their autonomy was strengthened, when they inherited the Imperial County of Tyrol in 1253 and were elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Charles IV in 1365. In the early 13th century, particularly under Volchero (1204‚Äì1218) and Berthold (1218‚Äì1251), the Patriarchate had a flourishing economy and cultural life, supported by a good road network. Damaged by earthquakes and other calamities, and reduced to a few hundred inhabitants, Aquileia was nearly abandoned in the 14th century. The capital of the state was moved first to Cividale and then, from 1238, to Udine in central Friuli, which had been a favourite residence of the patriarch since the 13th century and soon became a large city.  Rivalry with Venice  The patriarchs had regained the rule of the Istrian march from the Dukes of Merania in 1209. However, they had to cope with the rising naval power of the Republic of Venice, which in the late 13th century had occupied the western Istrian coast from Capodistra (Koper) down to Rovinj (Rovigno). In 1291 a peace was made in Treviso, whereupon the western coast of the peninsula fell to Venice. In the late century the patriarchate had to face the increasing rivalry with Venice, as well as the inner strifes between its vassals, and also became entangled in the endless wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines. In 1331 Venice also incorporated Pola (Pula) in the south. A certain recovery occurred during the rule of Bertrand (1334‚Äì1350), a successful administrator and military leader. He was killed in 1350 in a plot, at the age of ninety. The Counts of G√∂rz had retained some interior Istrian lands around Pazin (Mitterburg), which they bequeathed to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1374. In view of the Venetian threat, the city of Trieste submitted to the Habsburgs in 1382. Since the transfer of the patriarchal residence to Udine, the Venetians had never lived in peace with the Patriarchate, of whose Imperial favour and tendencies they were jealous. From about 1400, Venice under the Doge Michele Steno and his successor Tommaso Mocenigo began to enlarge its dogado by occupying the Aquileia hinterlands. At the same time, the Patriarchate suffered internal conflict between the citizens of Cividale and Udine. In 1411 this turned into a war which was to mark the end of the Patriarchate, Cividale having received support from most of the Friulian communes, the Carraresi of Padua, King Sigismund of Germany, also King of Hungary, while Udine was backed by the Venetians. In the December of that year an Imperial army captured Udine and, in the following January, Louis of Teck was implemented as patriarch in the city's cathedral. On July 23, 1419 the Venetians conquered Cividale and prepared to do the same with Udine. The city fell on June 7, 1420 after a long siege. Soon afterwards Gemona, San Daniele, Venzone and Tolmezzo followed. Secularisation The temporal authority of the patriarch was lost on 7 July 1420 when its territories were secularised by Venice. Doge Francesco Foscari in 1433 signed an agreement with Emperor Sigismund, whereby the Empire ceded the Domini di Terraferma, stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Alps, to the Republic, then officially as an Imperial fief. The territory around Gorizia and Aquileia proper was retained by the Counts of G√∂rz; the last Count Leonhard in 1500 bequeathed his lands to Archduke Maximilian I of Austria, who also annexed the city of Gradisca in 1511. The former G√∂rz territories were incorporated into the Inner Austrian possessions of the Habsburgs. In 1445, after Patriarch Ludovico Trevisan at the Council of Florence had acquiesced in the loss of his ancient temporal estate in return for an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the Venetian treasury, the war could be considered really over. Henceforth only Venetians were allowed to hold the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The former Friulian state was incorporated in the Venetian Republic with the name of Patria del Friuli, ruled by a General Proveditor or a Luogotenente living in Udine. In 1523 Emperor Charles V ultimately renounced any Imperial feudal rights to the former Aquileia territory. Parliament The Friulian parliament evolved out of ad hoc patriarchal councils of increasingly greater size, convoked in the 13th century to obtain the financial and military support of the Friulian barons in the near continual wars of patriarchs with their neighbours. By the century's end, the institution had become regularized and in the early 14th century it spoke of itself as acting \\"in the name of the whole population of Friuli\\" (nomine totius universitatis Foriiulii). During the entire period of patriarchal rule the parliament's primary function was military. Barons, ecclesiastics and towns participated according to their military responsibilities as listed in the talea militiae. These responsibilities were fixed and periodically changed by the parliament. The patriarchal demesne itself owed service according to the talea. The patriarch's chief influence over the parliament lay in his appointment of gastalds in the towns, by which means he could influence the choice of representatives the towns sent to parliament.Helmut Georg Koenigsberger, \\"The Italian Parliaments from their Origins to the End of the 18th Century\\", in Politicians and Virtuosi: Essays on Early Modern History (London: The Hambledon Press, 1986), 27‚Äì62 [originally published in The Journal of Italian History 1, 1 (1978), 18‚Äì49]: \\"Friuli was a part of Italy in which a feeling of community developed without the help of compelling geographical or ethnic circumstances, neither of which, in fact, existed. The cohesion of the principality was due to the feudal overlordship of its prince, the patriarch of Aquileia. Since the prince was an ecclesiastic, this was not a dynastic overlordship. The state could therefore not pass to a foreign ruler by inheritance, nor could it be divided among a ruler's sons, as happened so frequently in the lay principalities of Germany during the middle ages. Most important of all, monarchical power tended to become institutionalised relatively early.\\". The parliament met up to ten times a year, and was especially important during vacancies in the patriarchal office, which were frequent. Plenary sessions never lasted more than one day, and the main work of the parliament was done by committees (consigli, singular consiglio), of which just two were regular. The first was composed of sixteen men‚Äîtwo churchmen, two barons, eight ministeriales and four representatives of the towns‚Äîand any appointees the patriarch chose. This committee met for one or two days immediately after a plenary session to apply its decisions. The second committee consisted of three representatives each from the three estates of the realm elected by the plenary session and six appointees of the patriarch. The patriarch was eventually restricted in his selections to the members of parliament. This second committee sat for six months, becoming in essence a permanent committee. The parliament had original jurisdiction in cases of feudal law, conspiracy and rebellion, and in civil actions against the patriarch. It was also the court of last resort in almost all cases. In March 1355 the parliament codified a constitution for Friuli, the Constitutiones Patriae Foriiulii. This was amended in 1366, 1368 and 1380 and confirmed by Venice in 1429. It remained the fundamental law of the Patria del Friuli until the fall of Venice in 1797.C. Foligno, \\"Review of Pietro Silverio Leicht, Parlamento Friulano, Vol. I (1228‚Äì1331)\\", The English Historical Review, 37, 148 (1922): 576‚Äì79. The parliament cooperated with the patriarch in treating with foreign powers, but it had no role in the Venetian conquest and incorporation of Friuli into the Domini di Terraferma in 1420. Nonetheless, it continued to function in the same relation to a lieutenant (luogotenente) appointed by the Venetian Senate as it had had with the patriarch. Udine and Cividale ceased to participate and the parliament was divided into two assemblies for the regions east and west of the Tagliamento. In the mid-16th century, a separate body‚Äîthe corpo della contadinanza‚Äîrepresenting the rural districts was created. A 16th-century antiquary, Count Girolamo di Porcia, remarked nostalgically that Friuli under the patriarchs had \\"more the form of a republic than of a principality\\" (pi√π a forma di repubblica che di principato).

Etche/Omuma is one of the 13 federal constituencies representing River State in Nigeria's National Assembly and part of the Rivers East Senatorial District. Okehi is the Council Headquarters and political capital of Etche, while Eberi is the political capital of Omuma. There are 19 political wards in Etche local government and 10 in Omuma. There are several communities and towns in Etche, some of which include Akwu/Obuor, Eberi, Amaji, Opiro, Chokocho, Igboh, Egwi, Afara, Mba, Igbodo, Ofeh, Ohimogho, Obiohia Umuogba, Umuajuloke Okehi, Obibi, Odufor, Nihi, Okomoko, Ulakwo, Umuakonu, Umuechem, and Egbeke. Etche believe Igbodo to be their ancestral home. Economy Umuechem - Etche is the second place oil was discovered in Nigeria since the beginning of exploration in the area in 1958. Today, Etche has over 250 producing oil wells and a host of flow stations. It is also said to have the largest deposit of natural gas, south of the Niger river. The people of Etche are mostly engaged in agriculture, earning the nickname 'the food basket of the state'. Etche is one of the host communities of the government owned multi-billion naira palm oil production company Risonpalm, as well as Delta Rubber Production Company. In recent times, real estate development has grown in the area with rapid expansion going on in Igboh-Agwuruasa, Ulakwo-Umuselem and Okehi Clans. Cassava, plantain, banana and yam are important crops. Plantation agriculture (notably Rubber, palm oil, pineapple and plantain) was encouraged by the erstwhile Eastern Nigerian government but this has since lost steam. Agriculture is mostly not mechanized and the use of tractors for farming these crops has dropped slightly in the 1986‚Äì2004 period. Manufacturing is absent. A rubber processing plant, the Delta Rubber Factory, in Okomoko, has been dormant for more than a decade. Informal activities dominate economic activities alongside agriculture. Mining of the rivers for sand is a new activity. Tourism is not developed and there is a complete absence of tourism infrastructure such as hotels in the two LGAs. Oil and gas are found in many parts of Etche. Umuechem was the second place, after Oloibiri, where oil was found in commercial quantities in Nigeria. Shell Petroleum Development Company, the dominant oil operator in the area since the late 1950s, has only funded a largely ineffective and inefficient cassava processing mill at Umuebulu, and in 2000 it attempted albeit abysmally to provide training to local women in operation and management of the mill. Palm oil production by smallholders is a significant part of the economy. Political unrest Etche and Omuma LGAs are historically among the most peaceful areas of Nigeria. The two militia groups DeyWell and DeyGbam mostly energized and enabled by local politicians in the area have rained terror - incessant attacks and loss of lives and properties on the Etche land and environs. Kidnapping, armed robbery, rape and fights for territorial control have become prevalent in the area with little or no attention from the state and federal governments in Nigeria. Etche ethnic nationality also has a history of political activism. In October 1990, a demonstration was held in Umuechem, Etche to demand social amenities and compensation for oil pollution. State security agents reacted with teargas and gunfire. 50 people died and about 550 houses were destroyed. The April 2003 national elections were marked by serious violence and intimidation in the Etche LGA, seriously compromising the free voters process. In a 2007 report, Human Rights Watch said that \\"in recent years Etche has earned a degree of unwelcome notoriety due to allegations of corruption, thuggery and murder leveled against politicians and public office holders from the area.\\" The report stated that health and education facilities were in an advanced state of physical decay, with funds allocated for staffing and renovation being diverted for other purposes. In January 2009 the Etche legislative council impeached three of their members for \\"irrational and unconscionable behaviour, gross misconduct, misappropriation of legislative fund and abuse of office.\\" A training camp for ex-militants was established in Okehi in Etche LGA, teaching skills such as welding and fabrication, fitting, seafaring/marine, business and commerce and so on. In October 2009, 200 of the students demanded their allowances, threatening to return to the creeks to cause havoc if unpaid. Recent developments In August 2009, a Marriage Registration Centre was opened in the LGA. In September 2009 the Niger Delta Development Commission opened a free medical mission in Omuma Local Government Council.

He was the forerunner of what became known as the Green Revolution of the late 1960s. Strampelli's work allowed Italy to become almost self-sufficient in bread wheat production, relative to Italy's contemporaneous population and consumption patterns, increasing area-based agricultural intensity from an average yield of 1.0 t/ha at the beginning of the 19th century to about 1.5 t/ha in the 1930s,Gian Tommaso Scarascia Mugnozza: The contribution of Italian wheat geneticists: From Nazareno Strampelli to Francesco D'Amato , 2005. through the hybridization of wheat into high-yield varietals. Early years After graduating in agriculture at the University of Pisa, he taught for a few years at the University of Camerino and in Reggio Calabria. Career In 1900, while in Camerino, he started his research on the hybridization of wheat, although he was unaware of the concurrent work of Gregor Mendel. In 1903 he was chair of agriculture in Rieti, while there he continued to cross wheat varieties and within a few years developed new high-performing hybrid combinations. From 1907 he was in charge of the \\"Wheat experimental station\\". His wheat breeding programs achieved the shortening of the growing phase and increasing of the disease tolerance through the reduction of the stem size. Strampelli's best performing varieties were named Gregorio Mendel, Luigia, Varrone, followed by small sized and high baking varieties such as Villagloria, Ardito (the result of crossing local wheat with Japanese Akagomugi), Mentana, Edda, Balilla and Fanfulla. In order to disseminate the results of his studies, he established a farmers' association in Rieti. In 1919 a national cereal crop breeding institute was established in Rome, and Strampelli was appointed as director. Starting in 1925 he was in charge of a major national program, La battaglia del grano, supporting the increase of wheat production and yield, aimed at ensuring Italian food security and self- sufficiency. In 1929 he was nominated Senator of the Kingdom for his scientific achievements. Final years In his final years, he created three new high-yielding and small sized varieties of wheat: S. Pastore, Velino and Turano. The Mentana variety was exported and cropped in Sonora, Mexico, and became the source of a new generation of high-yielding, small size wheat varieties. The Istituto Sperimentale di Genetica \\"Nazareno Strampelli\\" in Lonigo, Vicenza, is named after him.

In petrology, the mineral clinopyroxene is used for temperature and pressure calculations of the magma that produced igneous rock containing this mineral. Clinopyroxene thermobarometry is one of several geothermobarometers. Two things makes this method especially useful: first, clinopyroxene is a common phenocryst in igneous rocks and easy to identify; second, the crystallization of the jadeite component of clinopyroxene implies a growth in molar volume being thus a good indicator of pressure.

Life The son of Thomas Gilbert of Ratcliffe, Buckinghamshire, a captain in the Royal Marines, by Elizabeth, daughter of William Long Nathaniel Hutton, rector of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire, was born near Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, 14 May 1786, and educated at Manchester Grammar School from 1800. He was nominated to a school exhibition, and matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 30 May 1805. At the Michaelmas examination of 1808 he was placed in the first class in literis humanioribus, one of his four companions being Robert Peel. He graduated B.A. 16 January 1809, and succeeded to one of Hulme's exhibitions on 8 March following. Having been elected to a fellowship, he proceeded M. A. 1811, and B.D. 1819. He was actively engaged for many years as a college tutor, and in 1816‚Äì18 was a public examiner. On the death of Frodsham Hodson in 1822, he was elected Principal of Brasenose on 2 February, and took his D.D. degree on 30 May. From 1836 to 1840 he was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. On the death of Philip Shuttleworth he was nominated to the bishopric of Chichester, 24 January 1842, and consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 27 February. Gilbert took much interest in Lancing College and other educational institutions. Of high church opinions himself, he was averse to Catholic ceremonials. He took proceedings in the 1850s against John Mason Neale, Warden of Sackville College; and on 14 October 1868 he interdicted John Purchas from ritualism in services at St. James's Chapel, Brighton. This latter case led to much litigation, and eighteen works were printed in connection with the matter. Gilbert was married on 31 December 1822 to Mary Anne, only surviving child of the Rev. Robert Wintle, vicar of Culham, Oxfordshire. They had eleven children. Mary Anne died in the Bishop's Palace at Chichester on 10 December 1863. Gilbert died of paralysis at the Bishop's Palace in Chichester on 21 February 1870, and was buried in Westhampnett Church, Sussex, on 25 February. Gilbert's blind daughter, Elizabeth Margaretta Maria Gilbert, became known for her philanthropic work.

It expresses a constructivist approach to the study of international relationsKratochwil, Friedrich, Constructing a New Orthodoxy? Wendt's \`Social Theory of International Politics' and the Constructivist Challenge, Millennium - Journal of International Studies January 2000 29: 73-101, and is one of the leading texts within the constructivist approach to international relations scholarship. Social Theory of International Politics expresses a theory that emphasises the role of shared ideas and norms in shaping state behaviour. It is critical of both liberal and realists approaches to the study of international relations which, Wendt argues, emphasize materialist and individualistic motivations for state actions rather than norms and shared values as Wendt argues they should. In a review of Social Theory of International Politics in Foreign Affairs G. John Ikenberry argues that the first section of the book is a \\"winding tour\\" of constructivism's underpinning. After this Wendt explores possible alternative \\"cultures\\" of international relations (Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian) a result of his view that anarchy does not necessarily mean that states must adopt egoistical self- help behaviour. Wendt further explores this view in an influential journal article \\"Anarchy Is What States Make of It\\" published in the journal International Organization. The book was the winner of International Studies Association Best Book of the Decade Award 1991-2000. The title is a reference to Kenneth Waltz's 1979 work Theory of International Politics.

Some measures of the difference between F(x+h) and G(x): * L1 norm = \\\\sum_{x\\\\in R}\\\\left\\\\vert F(x+h)-G(x) \\\\right\\\\vert * L2 norm = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{x\\\\in R}\\\\left [F(x+h)-G(x)\\\\right ]^{2}} * Negative of normalized correlation = \\\\dfrac{-\\\\sum_{x\\\\in R}F(x+h)G(x)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{x\\\\in R}F(x+h)^{2}}\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{x\\\\in R}G(x)^{2}}} Basic description of the registration algorithm The KLT feature tracker is based on two papers: In the first paper, Lucas and KanadeBruce D. Lucas and Takeo Kanade. An Iterative Image Registration Technique with an Application to Stereo Vision. International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 674‚Äì679, 1981. developed the idea of a local search using gradients weighted by an approximation to the second derivative of the image. One-dimensional case If h is the displacement between two images F(x) and G(x) = F(x+h) then the approximation is made that : F'(x) \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}=\\\\dfrac{G(x)-F(x)}{h}\\\\, so that : h \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{G(x)-F(x)}{F'(x)}\\\\, This approximation to the gradient of the image is only accurate if the displacement of the local area between the two images to be registered is not too large. The approximation to h depends on x. For combining the various estimates of h at various values of x, it is natural to average them: : h \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_{x}\\\\dfrac{G(x)-F(x)}{F'(x)}}{\\\\sum_{x}1}. The average can be further improved by weighting the contribution of each term to it, which is inversely proportional to an estimate of \\\\left \\\\vert F(x) \\\\right \\\\vert , where : F(x) \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{G'(x)-F'(x)}{h}. For the purpose of facilitating the expression, a weighting function is defined: : w(x) = \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\left \\\\vert G'(x)-F'(x) \\\\right \\\\vert}. The average with weighting is thereby: : h = \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_{x}\\\\dfrac{w(x)\\\\left [ G(x)-F(x) \\\\right ]}{F'(x)}}{\\\\sum_{x}w(x)}. Upon obtaining the estimate F(x) can be moved by the estimate of h. The procedure is applied repeatedly, yielding a type of Newton- Raphson iteration. The sequence of estimates will ideally converge to the best h. The iteration can be expressed by \\\\begin{cases} h_{0} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_{k+1} = h_{k} + \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_{x}\\\\dfrac{w(x)\\\\left [ G(x)-F(x+h_{k})\\\\right ]}{F'(x+h_{k})}}{\\\\sum_{x}w(x)} \\\\end{cases} An alternative derivation The derivation above cannot be generalized well to two dimensions for the 2-D linear approximation occurs differently. This can be corrected by applying the linear approximation in the form: : F(x+h) \\\\approx F(x)+hF'(x), to find the h which minimizes the L2 norm measure of the difference (or error) between the curves, where the error can be expressed as: : E=\\\\sum_{x}\\\\left [F(x+h)-G(x)\\\\right ]^{2}. To minimize the error with respect to h, partially differentiate E and set it to zero: : \\\\begin{align} 0 & = \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial h} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial h}\\\\sum_{x}\\\\left [F(x)+hF'(x)-G(x)\\\\right ]^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{x}2F'(x)\\\\left [F(x)+hF'(x)-G(x)\\\\right ] \\\\end{align}, : \\\\Rightarrow h \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_{x} F'(x)[G(x)-F(x)]}{\\\\sum_{x} F'(x)^{2}}\\\\, This is basically the same as the 1-D case, except for the fact that the weighting function w(x)=F'(x)^2. And the iteration form with weighting can be expressed as: \\\\begin{cases} h_0 = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_{k+1}=h_k + \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_x w(x)F'(x+h_k) \\\\left [G(x)-F(x+h_k)\\\\right ]}{\\\\sum_x w(x)F'(x+h_k)^2} \\\\end{cases} Performance To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we are naturally curious about under what conditions and how fast the sequence of h_k's converges to the real h. Consider the case: : F(x)=\\\\sin x, : G(x)=F(x+h)=\\\\sin (x+h). Both versions of the registration algorithm will converge to the correct h for \\\\left\\\\vert h\\\\right\\\\vert < \\\\pi, i.e. for initial misregistrations as large as one-half wavelength. The range of convergence can be improved by suppressing high spatial frequencies in the image, which could be achieved by smoothing the image, that will also undesirably suppress small details of it. If the window of smoothing is much larger than the size of the object being matched, the object may be suppressed entirely, so that a match would be no longer possible. Since lowpass-filtered images can be sampled at lower resolution with no loss of information, a coarse-to-fine strategy is adopted. A low- resolution smoothed version of the image can be used to obtain an approximate match. Applying the algorithm to higher resolution images will refine the match obtained at lower resolution. As smoothing extends the range of convergence, the weighting function improves the accuracy of approximation, speeding up the convergence. Without weighting, the calculated displacement h_1 of the first iteration with F(x)=\\\\sin x falls off to zero as the displacement approaches one-half wavelength. Implementation The implementation requires the calculation of the weighted sums of the quantities F'G, F'F, and (F')^2 over the region of interest R. Although F'(x) cannot be calculated exactly, it can be estimated by: : F'(x) \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{F(x+\\\\Delta x)-F(x)}{\\\\Delta x}, where \\\\Delta x is chosen appropriately small. Some sophisticated technique can be used for estimating the first derivatives, but in general such techniques are equivalent to first smoothing the function, and then taking the difference. Generalization to multiple dimensions The registration algorithm for 1-D and 2-D can be generalized to more dimensions. To do so, we try to minimize the L2 norm measure of error: : E=\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in R}\\\\left [F(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{h})-G(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right ]^{2}, where \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{h} are n-dimensional row vectors. A linear approximation analogous: : F(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{h}) \\\\approx F(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\mathbf{h}\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}F(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right)^{T}. And partially differentiate E with respect to \\\\mathbf{h}: : \\\\begin{align} 0 & = \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{h}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\approx \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{h}}\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\left [F(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\mathbf{h}\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right)^{T}-G(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right ]^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}}2\\\\left [F(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\mathbf{h}\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right)^{T}-G(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right ] \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align}, : \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{h} \\\\approx \\\\left [\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\left [G(\\\\mathbf{x})-F(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right ]\\\\left (\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right )\\\\right ] \\\\left [\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\left (\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right )^{T}\\\\left (\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right )\\\\right ]^{-1}, which has much the same form as the 1-D version. Further generalizations The method can also be extended to take into account registration based on more complex transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and shearing, by considering : G(x) = F(Ax+h), where A is a linear spatial transform. The error to be minimized is then : E=\\\\sum_{x}\\\\left [F(Ax+h)-G(x)\\\\right ]^2. To determine the amount \\\\Delta A to adjust A and \\\\Delta h to adjust h, again, use the linear approximation: : F(x(A+\\\\Delta A)+(h+\\\\Delta h)) : \\\\approx F(Ax+h)+(\\\\Delta Ax+\\\\Delta h)\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}F(x). The approximation can be used similarly to find the error expression, which becomes quadratic in the quantities to be minimized with respect to. After figuring out the error expression, differentiate it with respect to the quantities to be minimized and set the results zero, yielding a set of linear equations, then solve them. A further generalization is designed for accounting for the fact that the brightness may be different in the two views, due to the difference of the viewpoints of the cameras or to differences in the processing of the two images. Assume the difference as linear transformation: : F(x)=\\\\alpha G(x)+\\\\beta, where \\\\alpha represents a contrast adjustment and \\\\beta represents a brightness adjustment. Combining this expression with the general linear transformation registration problem: : E=\\\\sum_{x}\\\\left [F(Ax+h)-(\\\\alpha G(x)+\\\\beta)\\\\right ]^2 as the quantity to minimize with respect to \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, A, and h. Detection and tracking of point features In the second paper Tomasi and KanadeCarlo Tomasi and Takeo Kanade. Detection and Tracking of Point Features. Carnegie Mellon University Technical Report CMU-CS-91-132, April 1991. used the same basic method for finding the registration due to the translation but improved the technique by tracking features that are suitable for the tracking algorithm. The proposed features would be selected if both the eigenvalues of the gradient matrix were larger than some threshold. By a very similar derivation, the problem is formulated as : abla d = e\\\\, where abla is the gradient. This is the same as the last formula of Lucas‚ÄìKanade above. A local patch is considered a good feature to track if both of the two eigenvalues (\\\\lambda_{1} and \\\\lambda_{2}) of abla are larger than a threshold. A tracking method based on these two papers is generally considered a KLT tracker. Improvements and variations In a third paper, Shi and TomasiJianbo Shi and Carlo Tomasi. Good Features to Track. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 593-600, 1994. proposed an additional stage of verifying that features were tracked correctly. An affine transformation is fit between the image of the currently tracked feature and its image from a non-consecutive previous frame. If the affine compensated image is too dissimilar the feature is dropped. The reasoning is that between consecutive frames a translation is a sufficient model for tracking but due to more complex motion, perspective effects, etc. a more complex model is required when frames are further apart. Using a similar derivation as for the KLT, Shi and Tomasi showed that the search can be performed using the formula : Tz = a\\\\, where T is a matrix of gradients, z is a vector of affine coefficients and a is an error vector. Compare this to abla d = e. References See also * Kanade‚ÄìTomasi features in the context of feature detection * Lucas‚ÄìKanade method An optical flow algorithm derived from reference 1.

She is known as the intimate friend and speculated lover of Queen Christina of Sweden. Life Ebba Sparre was the daughter of statesman and marshal Lars Eriksson Sparre and M√§rta Ban√©r and grandchild of chancellor Erik Larsson Sparre. She arrived at court in 1644, where she was appointed hovfr√∂ken (maid of honour) to the queen. Sparre was a celebrated beauty at the royal court and nicknamed La belle comtesse (). She frequently played the part of Venus in the amateur ballets performed by the nobility at court.Sven Stolpe (Swedish): Kristina: Drottning & Rebell (Christina:Queen and rebel) (2004) p. 56. Her intimate relationship with Queen Christina gave rise to the speculation that they were lovers. This has never been confirmed. However, she did belong to the few women Queen Christina showed an interest in during her life in Sweden: with some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, Lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in her female courtiers, and generally mentions them only to express contempt over their femininity and portray herself as more masculine than them. In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor M√§rta Ulfsparre: \\"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now.

Stockholm: Atlantis AB. ; p. 321 Most of Christina's spare time was spent with \\"la belle comtesse\\", and she often called attention to her beauty. She introduced her to the English ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke as her 'bed-fellow', assuring him that Sparre's intellect was as striking as her body. When Christina left Sweden she continued to write passionate love-letters to Sparre, in which she told her that she would always love her. However, such emotional letters were relatively common at that time, and Christina would use the same style when writing to women she had never met, but whose writings she admired.Elisabeth Aasen: Barokke damer, edited by Pax, Oslo 2003, Ebba was engaged to Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna but broke the engagement to marry Count Jakob Kasimir de la Gardie, younger brother of the queen's favourite Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie, on the initiative of Christina. They married in 1652. The marriage was unhappy. Sparre and Christina kept in touch after Christina left Sweden in 1654. In 1661, Christina invited Sparre to visit her in Hamburg, and she also wished to see her during her visit to Sweden in 1660, but this was prevented by Sparre's family.Leif Lekeby (Swedish): Kung Kristina - Drottningen som ville byta k√∂n (King Christina - the queen who wished to change sex) (2000) p. 44  References  *Wilhelmina St√•lberg: Anteqningar om Svenska kvinnor (Notes on Swedish women)  Notes  Category:1629 births Category:1662 deaths Category:17th-century Swedish people Category:Swedish ladies-in-waiting Category:Swedish countesses Category:People of the Swedish Empire Category:Christina, Queen of Sweden ","title":"Ebba Sparre"},{"id":"24701506","text":"A Cisterna is a flattened membrane disk that makes up the Golgi apparatus, or one of the flattened membrane-enclosed sacs or tubes of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Introduction  Stowe instruments can be found on many of the world's leading sailing yachts, such as Velsheda. Stowe is now based in Lymington on the south coast of England.  History  The company was founded in the 1970s by Alan Cozens in a shed in his back garden in Rowlands Castle, Hampshire, England. The first product which proved very popular was the Trailing Log, a portable battery powered instrument that measures boat speed and distance run. Thousands of these early instruments are still in use today. Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s Stowe extended its activities into Integrated Instruments, Autopilots and Navigation Plotters. As a company Stowe has changed hands a number of times during its 25+ year lifetime, and is now a subsidiary of Tinley Electronics, the Lymington based marine electronics service company. Stowe however remains headquartered just a few miles from its birthplace.  Products  Stowe produces integrated instrumentation systems that collect and analyse a wide range of data relating both to a yacht's performance and the external conditions in which it is sailing. This information can then be displayed to the helmsman, navigator and crew and/or analysed by integral data processing functions to produce additional information that enable the yacht's crew to make informed decisions with regard to performance optimisation and navigation strategy and tactics - particularly in a competitive environment. Data that is collected may include apparent wind speed, apparent wind angle, boat speed, heading, position (Latitude/Longitude) and depth. By combining and analysing these inputs a Stowe system can calculate and display in real time information such as true wind speed, true wind direction, course over ground, velocity made good (VMG), time and distance to next waypoint, and much more. This data can additionally be fed into tactical navigation software running on a laptop computer and analysed against tidal and current databases, electronic charting and weather prediction feeds to enable the navigator to devise the fastest and most efficient route between two or more points. This information can also be fed into autopilot systems. In 2009 the Stowe product range is centred on the Dataline GX system, with a wide range of configurations available for boats of all types and sizes.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Unown first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Gold and Silver and in subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spin off titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Unlike other characters in the franchise, Unown do not have singular voice actors, but instead are voiced by several at once. Commonly referred to as the Symbol Pok√©mon, Unown are hieroglyph-like, thin, black ancient Pokemon usually found on walls. There are 28 forms of Unown: one for each letter of the English alphabet, a question mark, and an exclamation point. They were featured as the main antagonists of Spell of the Unown, the third Pok√©mon movie. Unown have also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee and the Pok√©mon Adventures manga. Unown does not evolve and weighs 11 pounds. Its name is pronounced un-OWN, although most people pronounce it like the word \\"unknown\\" (including in the anime). Design and characteristics The twenty-eight different forms of Unown. Unown were created by Ken Sugimori for the 1999 Game Boy games, Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. Unown began as an alien-type Pok√©mon, but when artists began to sketch them, they started to look like letters of the alphabet, and the Pokemon eventually became Psychic-type. Unown are hieroglyph-like, thin, black symbols usually found on walls. First appearing in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, Unown have 28 different forms, based on the letters of the Latin alphabet; the two punctuation marks of a question mark and an exclamation point were added in Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire (but unavailable until Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen). While the Latin based Unown have their eyes wide open, the punctuation Unown have their eyes half shut, almost to symbolize the end of a sentence. In the Pok√©mon universe, it is said that each form has different abilities. It is unknown whether the Unown came first, or the letters they resemble. The in-game Pok√©dex states that Unown can make telepathic contact with other beings. If multiple Unown come together, their power increases, which is shown in Pok√©mon 3: The Movie, where a large cluster of Unown come together and are able to bend reality. Unown's only known move in battle is \\"Hidden Power\\", an attack whose type depends on the individual values of the user. While only thirteen other Pokemon learn the move by level as Unown does, due to the move's TM, almost all Pokemon can learn it. In the movie, Professor Oak studies a new pair of Unown, which are actually modelled after Cyrillic. Appearances In video games Unown made its debut appearance in the Pok√©mon series in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. In this game, they can be found in the Ruins of Alph of Johto and are triggered once the player completes the puzzles in the caves found in the Ruins. They were also used as writings by classification of their shapes as seen in Pok√©mon Crystal. Unown appear again in Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, where they are found in the Tanoby Chambers in the Sevii Islands. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, they are found in a cave near Solaceon Town of Sinnoh, and writings in Unown letters can be seen on the top floor of the cave. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, when Arceus summons either Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina, Unown swarm around the player, Cynthia, and Arceus. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Unown appear when released from a Pok√© Ball and will fly off the screen. They then return with a large swarm similar to that of Beedrill in the original Super Smash Bros. The only difference is that Beedrill only attack from left or right while Unown can come from any direction. Opponents caught in this are damaged and juggled. There are also Unown that can be seen on the Pok√©float stage. In the second half of the cycle, they fly across the screen. Towards the end of the cycle, staying on the stage relies on hopping between the Unown. The Unown also appear as an obtainable trophy. In Pokemon GO, Unown can be found rarely in the wild, but also in Safari Zone events and the annual Go Fest event, usually in letters spelling out a word relevant to the event. The player can collect all forms of Unown, including the shiny forms. Shiny Unown made its debut in Pokemon Go on July 25, 2020 as part of the Go Fest 2020 event, in which \\"G\\" and \\"O\\" were released shiny. In other media The Unown are the main antagonists of Spell of the Unown, the third Pok√©mon movie. In the movie, the Unown send Professor Hale into their dimension. Later, Molly Hale releases Unown from their dimension. The Unown, reading Molly's mind, make her wishes come true, including turning Greenfield into crystal and creating Entei to be Molly's new dad. Because Molly also wants a mother, Entei kidnaps Ash Ketchum's mom. Eventually, Molly realizes that what she is doing is wrong and she wants to stop, but the power of the Unown is out of control. Entei destroys the psychic energy shield around the Unown, sacrificing himself in the process. The Unown are sent back into their dimension, and Professor Hale is released in Journey to The Unown from the Unown dimension. The Unown also make a brief cameo in the tenth Pok√©mon movie Pok√©mon: The Rise of Darkrai, in the scenes where Dialga and Palkia are seen fighting each other in the space- time rift dimension, swarms of Unown are seen floating about, many of which are blown away by Dialga and Palkia's attacks. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Unown first appear in Volume 8, when Gold and Bugsy are in the Ruins of Alph. Gold has his Sunkern use Flash to blind Team Rocket, but this accidentally disturbs the Unown from their slumber. Bugsy later returns to study the Ruins further in Volume 11, where he captures a \\"G\\"-shaped Unown. Unown later appear in Volume 24, having been awakened by Sird from the Tanoby Ruins to use as a distraction while she fought Lorelei. The Unown later appear again throughout the volume, being employed by Team Rocket as living security cameras while impeding the progress of Red, Blue and Green. They show up in the DP saga when Diamond, Pearl and Platinum visit Solaceon Town. Diamond and Pearl befriend two Unown, \\"D\\" and \\"P\\", who behave like each of them, respectively. Critical reception Variety described Unown as \\"purely abstract\\", further feeling them as having none of the appeal of other Pok√©mon species and \\"a bad idea that gets worse\\". IGN described them as \\"probably the single most useless Pokemon in existence\\", noting its contrast to other weaker Pok√©mon which would by comparison evolve into stronger forms eventually, and further described their sole appeal as one for children intending to use them to spell out profanity. Kat Bailey, also writing for IGN, noted it as the worst Pok√©mon design introduced in Gold and Silver, describing the Unown as \\"An Irritating Sidequest Approaches\\". 1UP.com named them the fifth \\"Lamest Pok√©mon\\" in the franchise, describing them as \\"silly gimmick Pok√©mon\\" and \\"useless\\" for in-game battles and other in-game events. GamesRadar called them \\"pretty awful\\", further describing them as \\"about as threatening as a vat of Alphabits\\". Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez cited Unown as an example of the second generation's quality. WhatCulture's Chris Comb included Unown in his list of the \\"laziest\\" and most \\"ill-conceived\\" Pok√©mon. He stated that he was interested in the Unown as a child, but grew to dislike them when he realized that they were less \\"rare, exciting, and useful\\" than they seemed. He claimed that it was \\"one of the first fears of Pok√©mon running out of ideas.\\" However, in an analysis of the article on 1UP FM, the host argued otherwise, feeling that while odd the characters had some appeal with children and further described it as \\"another layer of insanity\\" for people who were already interested in collecting all the species. In 2006, research was done on using Unown to teach the biological concepts of classification and phylogeny to students, with the researchers finding the results to be \\"very encouraging\\".

On October 15, 2009, following the defeat of Emil Boc's government through a motion of no confidence, President Traian BƒÉsescu nominated Croitoru to be Prime Minister of Romania. The nomination was opposed by a majority of Parliament, which adopted a declaration asking for his withdrawal, and vowing support for the candidature of Klaus Iohannis. Croitoru assembled a proposed cabinet, but this was voted down by Parliament on November 4. Biography Academic and government career Croitoru was born in Otopeni, Ilfov County.

It is an adaptation of a 1997 play by √âric-Emmanuel Schmitt. Synopsis The philosopher Denis Diderot, one of the modernists of the French 18th-century Age of Enlightenment movement, is a guest at the ch√¢teau of the Baron d'Holbach. The film depicts the Baron (in reality a major sponsor of Diderot) as a benign host and inventor of amusing machines, including a piganino. Diderot's banned Encyclop√©die is being secretly set up, printed and bound in a crypt beneath the chapel, where the noise of the presses is masked by the playing of an organ. Madame Therbouche, a purported portrait painter and intrigante, arrives from Berlin. She has made a painting of Diderot's idol, Voltaire, and convinces him to be more daring and to pose for her in the nude, leading to an animated row with his wife Antoinette. This unsavoury event is witnessed by a feared visitor, Baron d'Holbach's brother, the Cardinal, who is hunting for the illegal Encyclop√©die printers. To divert him from entering the chapel, the Baroness confesses to him her real and imagined sins and sends every woman in the castle to do the same. Most notably her guest, the depraved Madame de Jerfeuil, is having a lesbian affair with her cousin. The couple is later joined spontaneously by her husband the Chevalier de Jerfeuil, who has been seduced by two other male guests. Diderot's romantic adventures oblige him to constantly revise his article on the subject of morality. Eventually, secret agenda are disclosed and the painter is revealed as a spy in the Cardinal's service. However, she finally defects to Diderot's material and sensual causes, and the Cardinal fails to find the clandestine publishing operation which has been transplanted to Amsterdam.

Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman released an influential series of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Memos known as the Lambda Papers (1975‚Äì1980). This resulted in the growth of popularity in the language and the era of standardization from 1990 onward. Much of the history of Scheme has been documented by the developers themselves. Prehistory The development of Scheme was heavily influenced by two predecessors that were quite different from one another: Lisp provided its general semantics and syntax, and ALGOL provided its lexical scope and block structure. Scheme is a dialect of Lisp but Lisp has evolved; the Lisp dialects from which Scheme evolved‚Äîalthough they were in the mainstream at the time‚Äîare quite different from any modern Lisp. Lisp Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). McCarthy published its design in a paper in Communications of the ACM in 1960, entitled \\"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I\\" (Part II was never published). He showed that with a few simple operators and a notation for functions, one can build a Turing-complete language for algorithms. The use of s-expressions which characterize the syntax of Lisp was initially intended to be an interim measure pending the development of a language employing what McCarthy called \\"m-expressions\\". As an example, the m-expression \`car[cons[A,B \` is equivalent to the s-expression \`\`. S-expressions proved popular, however, and the many attempts to implement m-expressions failed to catch on. The first implementation of Lisp was on an IBM 704 by Steve Russell, who read McCarthy's paper and coded the eval function he described in machine code. The familiar (but puzzling to newcomers) names CAR and CDR used in Lisp to describe the head element of a list and its tail, evolved from two IBM 704 assembly language commands: Contents of Address Register and Contents of Decrement Register, each of which returned the contents of a 15-bit register corresponding to segments of a 36-bit IBM 704 instruction word. The first complete Lisp compiler, written in Lisp, was implemented in 1962 by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT. This compiler introduced the Lisp model of incremental compilation, in which compiled and interpreted functions can intermix freely. The two variants of Lisp most significant in the development of Scheme were both developed at MIT: LISP 1.5 developed by McCarthy and others, and Maclisp ‚Äì developed for MIT's Project MAC, a direct descendant of LISP 1.5. which ran on the PDP-10 and Multics systems. Since its inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence (AI) research community, especially on PDP-10. The 36-bit word size of the PDP-6 and PDP-10 was influenced by the usefulness of having two Lisp 18-bit pointers in one word. ALGOL ALGOL 58, originally to be called IAL for \\"International Algorithmic Language\\", was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at ETH Zurich. ALGOL 60, a later revision developed at the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris and now commonly named ALGOL, became the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development, despite the language's lack of commercial success and its limitations. Tony Hoare has remarked: \\"Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.\\" (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to Edsger W. Dijkstra, also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 compiler.) ALGOL introduced the use of block structure and lexical scope. It was also notorious for its difficult call by name default parameter passing mechanism, which was defined so as to require textual substitution of the expression representing the working parameter in place of the formal parameter during execution of a procedure or function, causing it to be re- evaluated each time it is referenced during execution. ALGOL implementors developed a mechanism they called a thunk, which captured the context of the working parameter, enabling it to be evaluated during execution of the procedure or function. Carl Hewitt, the Actor model, and the birth of Scheme In 1971 Sussman, Drew McDermott, and Eugene Charniak had developed a system called Micro-Planner which was a partial and somewhat unsatisfactory implementation of Carl Hewitt's ambitious Planner project. Sussman and Hewitt worked together along with others on Muddle, later renamed MDL, an extended Lisp which formed a component of Hewitt's project. Drew McDermott, and Sussman in 1972 developed the Lisp-based language Conniver, which revised the use of automatic backtracking in Planner which they thought was unproductive. Hewitt was dubious that the \\"hairy control structure\\" in Conniver was a solution to the problems with Planner. Pat Hayes remarked: \\"Their [Sussman and McDermott] solution, to give the user access to the implementation primitives of Planner, is however, something of a retrograde step (what are Conniver's semantics?)\\" In November 1972, Hewitt and his students invented the Actor model of computation as a solution to the problems with Planner. A partial implementation of Actors was developed called Planner-73 (later called PLASMA). Steele, then a graduate student at MIT, had been following these developments, and he and Sussman decided to implement a version of the Actor model in their own \\"tiny Lisp\\" developed on Maclisp, to understand the model better. Using this basis they then began to develop mechanisms for creating actors and sending messages. PLASMA's use of lexical scope was similar to the lambda calculus. Sussman and Steele decided to try to model Actors in the lambda calculus. They called their modeling system Schemer, eventually changing it to Scheme to fit the six-character limit on the ITS file system on their DEC PDP-10. They soon concluded Actors were essentially closures that never return but instead invoke a continuation, and thus they decided that the closure and the Actor were, for the purposes of their investigation, essentially identical concepts. They eliminated what they regarded as redundant code and, at that point, discovered that they had written a very small and capable dialect of Lisp. Hewitt remained critical of the \\"hairy control structure\\" in Scheme and considered primitives (e.g., \`START!PROCESS\`, \`STOP!PROCESS\`, and \`EVALUATE!UNINTERRUPTIBLY\`) used in the Scheme implementation to be a backward step. 25 years later, in 1998, Sussman and Steele reflected that the minimalism of Scheme was not a conscious design goal, but rather the unintended outcome of the design process. \\"We were actually trying to build something complicated and discovered, serendipitously, that we had accidentally designed something that met all our goals but was much simpler than we had intended... we realized that the lambda calculus‚Äîa small, simple formalism‚Äîcould serve as the core of a powerful and expressive programming language.\\" On the other hand, Hewitt remained critical of the lambda calculus as a foundation for computation writing \\"The actual situation is that the Œª-calculus is capable of expressing some kinds of sequential and parallel control structures but, in general, not the concurrency expressed in the Actor model. On the other hand, the Actor model is capable of expressing everything in the Œª-calculus and more.\\" He has also been critical of aspects of Scheme that derive from the lambda calculus such as reliance on continuation functions and the lack of exceptions. The Lambda Papers Between 1975 and 1980 Sussman and Steele worked on developing their ideas about using the lambda calculus, continuations and other advanced programming concepts such as optimization of tail recursion, and published them in a series of AI Memos which have become collectively termed the Lambda Papers.

It was also one of the first programming languages after Reynold's Definitional Language to support first-class continuations. It had a large impact on the effort that led to the development of its sister-language, Common Lisp, to which Guy Steele was a contributor. Standardization The Scheme language is standardized in the official Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard,1178-1990 (R1995) IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language and a de facto standard called the Revisedn Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (RnRS). The most widely implemented standard is R5RS (1998), and a new standard, R6RS, was ratified in 2007.

Security seals are tamper evident mechanisms used to seal cargo in transit shipping containers in a way that provides tamper evidence and some level of security. Such seals can help to detect theft or contamination, either accidental or deliberate. Security seals are commonly used to secure truck trailers, vessel containers, chemical drums, airline duty-free trolleys, and utility meters. Typically they are considered an inexpensive way of providing tamper evidence of intrusion into sensitive spaces. Vulnerabilities Security seals are not designed to resolve all security problems: The same organization demonstrated that a trained individual was able, using low-tech methods, to defeat 90% of the 244 seals they studied in less than 3 minutes, and all of them in less than 44 minutes. They offer ideas on countermeasures, and are exploring the promising option of \\"anti-evidence\\" seals. Operation Security seals can be split into two main groups: single-use and reusable. Single-use seals are typically made of plastic or metal, and the used material and production technology is the key to their security level. Reusable seals are usually electronic or mechanical rather than just made from plastic, and if purely plastic, only one part is reusable. Electronic and mechanical seals are generally used for the transportation industry, with seal fixed to the back of trucks, trailers, and shipping containers. A reusable mechanical or electronic seal can be fitted to the rear or loading doors, extending a cable from itself through fixing points on the doors, and when sealed generating a unique number which is logged. When the door is next opened this number changes, so it provides tamper evidence for the load. High Security Seals A High Security Seal is constructed and manufactured of material such as metal or metal cable with the intent to delay intrusion and have been designed to conform with world customs and ISO security seal standards. The International Standards Organization (ISO) published the new version of ISO 17712 on 15 May 2013. The major changes in the new edition concern Clause 6, Evidence of Tampering. Changes were required due to the demonstrated impracticality of tamper-related tests in ISO 17712:2010 edition. A measure of a seal's security is whether it has obtained an ISO 17712:2013 rating. US Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) and the World Customs Organization's Framework of standards, endorsed and encouraged the use of ISO compliant seals. The requirements for certain security level of seals are defined in the ISO 17712. The seals that belong to the High security level and Security level are also called \\"barrier seals\\". They are made of different metals or metal alloys, meaning that they require special tools to be opened, such as bolt cutters or pliers. Cable seals and bolt seals also fall into this category. Designed to deter opportunistic theft of high value goods, they also can often be branded and numbered to improve tamper resistance and provide excellent security for containers. The seals that are in the Indicative level as to ISO 17712 are made of plastic or thin metal. Security Seal Manufacturers have worked alongside ISO Security Auditors to provide the following information to help inform businesses and other interested parties about the new edition. (HMRC) Customs Accepted Seals Customs accepted seals are security seals which the customs department of a given country will accept as a secure seal to be placed onto a container. This does not mean that all exporters or importers should place a customs accepted seal on their containers or trailers. Many businesses who transport high value goods like to use Customs Accepted Seals as these seals have been through rigorous testing and are of high quality. The UK Security Seal Testing Authority tests these seals on various points such as \\"Tensile Strength\\", \\"Effects of Heat\\", \\"Direct Effects of Freezing\\", \\"Effective Numbering & Marking\\", \\"Tamper Evidence\\", and more. UK Customs Accepted seals are sorted into three various categories, Group 1 consists of seals which withstand a force of 1000kg, Group 2 consists of seals which withstand a force of 250kg and Group 3 consists of other accepted seals. View all UK customs accepted seals here. Metal seals There are several basic designs of the metal seals; bolt seals, ball seals, and cable seals. Bolt seals are used to secure shipping containers, trucks, and trailers. A bolt seal used for securing containers must conform to the ISO 17712 high security seal in order to be accepted by customs all around the world in ocean shipping. The C-TPAT (Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) specifies ISO 17712 compliant security seals to be used. Bolt seals are generally closed by hand (by pushing the seal body and head together) and opened with the use of bolt cutters. This gives a strong and secure seal for transportation, while remaining convenient for staff in ports and warehouses. Cable seals Cable seals allow for more versatile application, as they have variable length of the locking mechanism limited only by the cable length. Typical applications include sealing trucks and railway cars transporting valuable commodities. An internal locking mechanism prevents the cable from being retracted. Most cable seals are classified as security or high security level as to ISO 17712. All ISO 17712 compliant seals are numbered on both seal body and head, to prevent substitution of either part. This is usually done using laser marking, which cannot be rubbed off. Ball seals are commonly used for securing trucks. They consist of a metal strip with a punched hole, attached to a housing section. When the strip is bent and threaded through the hole, a ball inside the housing section locks it in place. Most ball type seals belong only to the indicative level as to ISO 17712. Plastic seals Plastic security seals are manufactured normally in two styles; adjustable or fixed-length. Adjustable- length seals can fit many applications from securing the neck of a bag or mail sack to sealing chemical drums, first aid kits, and fire extinguishers. They have an adjustable length much like a cable seal but offer a much higher security level and an audit trail due to sequential numbering and the ability on some seals to be bar-coded and have a company name and logo printed or laser etched on. Fixed-length seals tend to be more tamper resistant than variable-length as there are no sliding parts, they simply \\"click\\" into place to lock, which can make them easier to fit than variable-length seals. Most fixed-length seals can also be branded and numbered for extra security. Fixed- length is often the choice of single-use security seals for transport applications. Padlock seals are usually supplied as a completely plastic seal, shaped as a standard padlock would be. Technically, they can be classed as a fixed-length seal. They feature the same types of tamper-evident protection as variable-length and fixed-length have available - numbering, bar-coding, and branding - but fit some different applications. The most common use for these seals is for airline duty-free trolleys. One reason for this is that plastic padlocks can be placed over a locking part as any metal padlock would be to secure, but do not require keys to open, they simply break off at their built in break point using hands or a small pair of wire cutters. They are secure due to the audit trail available as a result of the sequential numbering. Meter seals are used with electric or gas or water meters and usually molded in polycarbonate. The transparent body of the seal means that the locking mechanism is visible, and can provide clear indication of tampering. Meter seals can withstand exposure to sunlight and extreme weather, and a wide range of temperatures. Designed for only a single use, they are destroyed when removed. Some meter seals contain components which glow under ultraviolet light, allowing the seal to be easily located in darkness. Special security tapes and labels have high bond-strength adhesives in combination with backing that are designed to fracture or delaminate under designated conditions to indicate premature attempts at opening. Custom printing, holograms, and security printing often assist in deterring and indicating tampering. Technologies for marking the seals The seals can be individualized to fit the needs of the user. Typical marking includes logos, special texts, white pads for writing by hand, consecutive numbering, and 1D and 2D bar codes. Several marking technologies are in use, including hot stamping, inkjet printing, laser engraving, and thermal printing. C-TPAT The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and focused on improving the security of private companies' supply chains with respect to terrorism. The program was launched in November 2001 with seven initial participants, all large U.S. companies. Large-scale Security Seal producers were included within the \\"invited foreign manufacturers\\" segment of the ordinance. C-TPAT-compliant security ties indicate they are compliant with international shipping security standards.

Humans likely developed cheese and other dairy foods by accident, as a result of storing and transporting milk in bladders made of ruminants' stomachs, as their inherent supply of rennet would encourage curdling. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated, possibly Europe, or Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Sahara. Earliest origins The earliest direct evidence of cheesemaking is now being found in clay sieves (holed pottery) over seven thousand years old, for example in Kujawy, Poland, and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, the latter with dried remains which chemical analysis suggests was cheese. Shards of holed pottery were also found in Urnfield pile-dwellings on Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland and are hypothesized to be cheese-strainers,Toussaint-Samat 2009:103. they date back to 6,000 BCE (8,000 years ago). For preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk. Animal skins and inflated internal organs already provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Curdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds, which could easily have led to the conscious addition of rennet. Hard salted cheese is likely to have accompanied dairying from the outset. It is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate. Dairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors. The earliest written evidence of cheese (GA.UAR) is the Sumerian cuneiform texts of Third Dynasty of Ur, dated at the early second millennium BC.In NBC 11196 (5 NT 24, dated Shu-Sin 6), the 'abra's of Dumuzi, Ninkasi, and I'kur receive butter and cheese from the 'abra of Inanna, according to W.W. Hallo, \\"The House of Ur-Meme\\", Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 1972; a Sumerian/Akkadian bilingual lexicon of ca 1900 BC lists twenty kinds of cheese. The earliest cheeses were sour and salty and similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or present-day feta. In Late Bronze Age Minoan-Mycenaean Crete, Linear B tablets recorded the inventorying of cheese, (Mycenaean Greek in Linear B: , tu-ro; later Greek: ). flocks and shepherds.Michael Ventris and John Chadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek, 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press) 1973:572, 588; implications of modern pre-industrial Cretan pastoralists and cheese production for interpreting the archaeological record, are discussed by H. Blitzer, \\"Pastoral Life in the Mountains of Crete\\", 1990. An Arab legend attributes the discovery of cheese to an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk. However, cheese was already well known among the Sumerians.  Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome  Cheese in a market in Italy Archaeological evidence for making cheese in Egypt goes back about 5,000 years. In 2018, archeologists from Cairo University and the University of Catania reported the discovery of the oldest known cheese from Egypt. Discovered in the Saqqara necropolis, it is around 3200 years old. Earlier, remains identified as cheese were found in the funeral meal in an Egyptian tomb dating around 2900 BC.Walter Bryan Emery: A Funerary Repast in an Egyptian Tomb of the Archaic Period. Nederlands instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, Leiden 1962 Visual evidence of Egyptian cheesemaking was found in Egyptian tomb murals in approximately 2000 BC.History of Cheese. accessed 2007/06/10 Cheese-making was known in Europe at the earliest level of Hellenic myth.The archaic myth of the culture-hero Aristaeus, who introduced bee-keeping and cheese-making before wine was known in Greece. According to Pliny the Elder, cheese became a sophisticated enterprise at the start of the ancient Rome era. During the ancient Rome era, valued foreign cheeses were transported to Rome to satisfy the tastes of the social elite. Ancient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese. Homer's Odyssey (late 8th century BC) describes the Cyclops producing and storing sheep's and goat's milk and cheese: A letter of Epicurus to his patron requests a wheel of hard cheese so that he may make a feast whenever he wishes. Pliny recorded the Roman tradition that Zoroaster had lived on cheese.Pliny's Natural History, iii .85. By Roman times, cheese- making was a mature art and common food group. Columella's De Re Rustica (circa 65 CE) details a cheese-making process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. Pliny's Natural History (77 CE) devotes two chapters (XI, 96-97) to the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early Empire. He stated that the best cheeses came from pagi near N√Æmes, and were identifiable as Loz√®re and G√©vaudan and had to be eaten fresh.  Post-Roman Europe  Most cheeses were initially recorded in the late Middle Ages. Cheddar was recorded around 1500 CE, Parmesan was founded in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791. Cheeses diversified in Europe with locales developing their own traditions and products when Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar neighbors with their own cheese-making traditions. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers encountered unfamiliar cheeses. Charlemagne's first encounter with an edible rind white cheese forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's Life of the Emperor.Notker, ¬ß15. Cheese-making in manor and monastery intensified local characteristics imparted by local bacterial flora while the identification of monks with cheese is sustained through modern marketing labels.Noted in passing by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat A History of Food, 2nd ed. 2009:106. This also led to a diversity of cheese types. Today, Britain has 15 protected cheeses from approximately 40 types listed by the British Cheese Board. The British Cheese Board claims a total number of about 700 different products (including similar cheeses produced by different companies). France has 50 protected cheeses, Italy 46, and Spain 26. France also has at least 1,800 raw milk cheese products and probably more than 2,000 when including pasteurized cheese. Furthermore, French proverb states that there is a different French cheese for every day of the year. Late French general and statesman, Charles de Gaulle, once asked \\"how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?\\"Quoted in Newsweek, 1 October 1962, according to The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations (Columbia University Press, 1993 p 345). Numbers besides 246 are often cited in very similar quotes; whether these are misquotes or whether de Gaulle repeated the same quote with different numbers is unclear. Meanwhile, the advancement of cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. It became a staple of long-distance commerce,Details of the local costs and export duties in importing cheese from Apulia to Florence, ca 1310-40, are included in Francesco di Balduccio Pergolotti's Practice of Commerce, translated in Robert Sabatino Lopez, Irving Woodworth Raymond, Medieval trade in the Mediterranean world: illustrative documents, 2001:117, no. 46. was disregarded as peasant fare,The stratification of medieval food is discussed in Stephen Mennell, All Manners of Food: Eating and Taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the Present, 1996: \\"Eating in the Middle Ages: the social distribution of food\\", pp 41ff; Mennell observes, \\"Dairy produce very much remained identified with the lower orders and disdained by the grand\\", adding \\"one of the few ways in which peasants in the mountains of Provence had a dietary advantage over the archbishop [of Arles] was in their high consumption of cheese.\\" inappropriate on a noble table, and even harmful to one's health through the Middle Ages.William Edward Mead, The English Medieval Feast, 1931 notes \\"the advice to avoid peaches, apples, pears and cheese, etc., as injurious to health\\" as unintelligible to moderns. A traditional thatched buron, or cheese-making barn, in the Mont-Dore, Puy-de-D√¥me, France A disused stone cheese-press at the farm Auchabrack, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland In 1546, The Proverbs of John Heywood claimed \\"the moon is made of a greene cheese\\" (Greene is referred to being new or unaged).Cecil Adams (1999). \\"Straight Dope: How did the moon=green cheese myth start?\\". Retrieved October 15, 2005. Variations on this sentiment were long repeated and NASA exploited this myth for an April Fools' Day spoof announcement in 2006.  Americas  Reports by conquistadors suggest that the Inca and other Andean cultures consumed llama cheese.https://www.dairymoos.com/milk-in-pre-columbian-america/ However some studies failed to find any references to milking in these cultures. Since the European colonization of the Americas, local cheeses have been developed across both North and South America. Mass-produced cheese has become quite common, replacing hand-made and/or local cheeses even more in the United States than in Europe. Recently, more people in the US have been making farmstead (or farmhouse) and artisan cheeses.  Asia  Preserved cheese dating from 1615 BC was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China. Local cheese today is commonly made or available in most of South Asia in the form of paneer and related cheeses. Rubing in Yunnan, China is similar to paneer. Mainstream Chinese culture is not dairy-centric, but some outlying regions of the country including Yunnan have strong cheese traditions. There are a variety of Tibetan cheeses.  Modern  Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was most common by far in Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. It was unheard of or far less common in sub-Saharan Africa, the rest of Asia, and pre-colonization Americas. Although cheese is still less prominent in local cuisines outside of Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, most cheeses have become popular worldwide through the spread of European and Euro-American empires and culture.  Mass production  The first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815. However, the large-scale production found real success in the United States. Credit goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from Rome, New York. Williams began making cheese in an assembly-line fashion using the milk from neighbouring farms in 1851. Within decades, hundreds of dairy associations existed. Mass-produced rennet began in the 1860s. By the turn of the century, scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Previously, bacteria in cheese was derived from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey. Pure cultures meant a standardized cheese could be produced. The mass production of cheese made it readily available to the poorer classes. Therefore, simple cost-effective storage solutions for cheese gained popularity. Ceramic cheese dishes, or cheese bells, became one of the most common ways to prolong the life of cheese in the home. It remained popular in most households until the introduction of the home refrigerator in 1913. Factory-made cheese overtook traditional cheese-making during the World War II era. Since then, factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe. Today, Americans buy more processed cheese than \\"real\\", factory-made cheese.

Sired by Smart Strike, a half brother to Canadian Triple Crown Winner Dance Smartly, his dam, Private Feeling, was sired by Belong To Me by the North American Leading Sire of 1993, Danzig.The Blood-Horse, May 17, 2010 Lookin At Lucky proved to be the best three-year-old in training by winning the 2010 Eclipse Award as division champion being named American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. He dominated the voting that year; Lookin At Lucky, 224 votes; Eskendereya, 5 votes; Paddy O'Prado, 1 vote. As the award was presented January 2011, it was announced that Lookin At Lucky had become the first horse in 32 years to be named the champion of his division at both age two and age three. No other horse had accomplished such a feat since Spectacular Bid did it 1978 and 1979.  Early career  Bred by Gulf Coast Farms, Lookin At Lucky was bought back as a yearling for $35,000 at the 2008 Keeneland September Sale. After working 1/8 of a mile in 10 seconds, Lookin at Lucky was bought by popular trainer Bob Baffert at the 2009 Keeneland April Sale for $475,000. Lookin At Lucky raced for owners Mike Pegram, Karl Watson, and Paul Weitman. Two-year-old Season Maiden Race * Lookin At Lucky broke his maiden at the Cushion Track at Hollywood Park on July 11, going 6 furlongs. Best Pal Stakes * He followed up this win in the Grade II Best Pal Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. Ridden by Garrett Gomez he finished the six and a half furlongs in a time of 1:16.06. Del Mar Futurity Stakes * His handlers then decided to try the 7 furlong, Grade I, Del Mar Futurity Stakes, with Garrett Gomez again in the saddle he won in final time of 1:22.85. Norfolk Stakes * During the Oak Tree Racing Association meet at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, Lookin At Lucky solidified his entrance into the 2009 Breeders' Cup Juvenile by winning the Grade I Norfolk Stakes at a distance of 1 miles (8.5 furlongs). He finished in a final time of 1:43.11 in a full field of 12. Breeders' Cup Juvenile * Going off as the favorite from post 13, Lookin At Lucky had a difficult trip and finished second by a head behind the long shot European winner, Vale of York. CashCall Futurity * On December 19, Lookin At Lucky sealed American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors with a win over chief rival Noble's Promise in the CashCall Futurity. Three-year-old Season Rebel Stakes * On March 13, Lookin At Lucky made his three-year-old debut at Oaklawn Park with a win in the Rebel Stakes. He won by a head over arch-rival Noble's Promise, even though he stumbled badly during the run down the backstretch. Santa Anita Derby * On April 3, he had a horrendous trip under Garrett Gomez in the Santa Anita Derby. Bumped, jostled and virtually ridden into the fence, Lookin At Lucky finished third. Kentucky Derby * Going into the 2010 Kentucky Derby, Lookin At Lucky was made the favorite after the scratch of Eskendereya. Drawing the number one inside post, he was pinned to the rail and had nowhere to go until a late run to wind up sixth, making it his first off-the-board finish. Preakness Stakes * After a disappointing Kentucky Derby finish, trainer Bob Baffert turned to young jockey Martin Garcia and fired Garrett Gomez after three consecutive races where the veteran jockey could not keep the horse out of trouble. On May 15, Garcia rode Lookin At Lucky to a win in the 135th running of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Lookin At Lucky went off as the 2‚Äì1 second choice and paid $6.80 to win in a time of 1:55.47, holding off pacesetter First Dude and the late- charging Jackson Bend.The Blood-Horse, May 15, 2010 Haskell Invitational Handicap * Martin Garcia rode Lookin At Lucky again in the Haskell Invitational. The 6-5 favorite, he broke a bit awkwardly, but Garcia steadied him and positioned him three wide on the first turn. Entering the far turn while still 3 paths wide, he moved past his competitors, winning the race by four lengths over upcoming Trappe Shot, followed by First Dude and Super Saver, the Kentucky Derby winner. He received a career-best 105 Beyer Speed Figure for the most dominant performance of his career. Indiana Derby * Lookin at Lucky developed an illness after the Haskell and missed a month of training. Regrouping, Baffert pointed his star toward the Indiana Derby, held at small Hoosier Park. Lookin At Lucky drew post position 6 in a field of nine horses and became the overwhelming favorite at odds of 2‚Äì5. He broke well but fell back to last early in the race and around the first turn. Still in eighth place on the backstretch, Lookin At Lucky came five-wide around the far turn, caught the leader in late home-stretch and won by 1 lengths. He earned a 103 Beyer Speed Figure for his performance. Breeders Cup Classic * After his win in the Indiana Derby, Baffert pointed the horse toward the 27th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic. Lookin At Lucky trained well but was compromised by a \\"minor infection and a cough\\" a week before the race. \\"I had to treat him with antibiotics, and sometimes that's hard on a horses system,\\" Baffert said. Lookin At Lucky was healthy for the race, but was placed farther back than usual early and finished fourth.

The structure is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History and critique The building was designed by John Douglas for the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1881. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe it as \\"marvellous\\". Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, refers to its \\"ducal grandeur\\". The description in the National Heritage List for England concludes by describing it as \\"a bravura gatehouse, impressive for its grand scale, picturesque massing and rich detailing\\". Architecture The gatehouse has three storeys and \\"a hipped roof so high and so steep as to be virtually a spire\\". The lowest storey is in banded stone, the upper two storeys are in red brick with diapering in blue brick and stone dressings, and the roofs have red tiles. An arched gateway forms the bottom storey and contains an ornate wrought iron gate. Under the archway is ribbed vaulting. Centrally over the gateway is a stone panel containing armorial carvings. Above this are transomed and mullioned windows and at the top is a spirelet (small spire). One each side of the panel are smaller windows.

The current church building is the fourth in the church's history. It is a white frame church built in the 1840s; nearby is a Greek Revival parsonage of similar vintage. The church was extensively renovated and expanded in 1873, giving it more of a Late Gothic Revival appearance. It was one of the first churches founded in the town when settlement began after the Revolution. One of its early pastors was Lemuel Haynes, the first African-American ordained minister in North America. In 2005 it and its parsonage were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The church and parsonage are on a small unpaved semi-circular drive on the north side of Route 149 at the western edge of South Granville. The church faces southwest at the head of the drive, with the parsonage to its south. In the center of the drive is a landscaped green with a state historical marker. Church The church building is a three-by-four-bay one-story church on a stone foundation sided in vinyl over clapboard topped with a gabled roof. A two-stage bell tower with mansard roof rises from the center. The rounded-arched windows on the southern (front) facade are topped with decorative carved scrolls. On the inside, double doors with oak molding lead from the narthex to the sanctuary. In it the nave has 12 rows of oak pews flanking the center aisle with smaller side aisles. All have carved S-shaped scroll arms and a brass number plate at the end. Oak also is used for the triple-arched pulpit and the rail around the choir loft. The ceiling has coves on adjacent walls to improve the sanctuary's acoustics, to the point that local community concerts are often held at South Granville despite the presence of larger churches in the region. Five brass chandeliers provide light, along with wall sconces. The window behind the choir is filled with a stained glass depiction of the church; the other windows have colored glass framing stippled glass panes. Parsonage The parsonage, just south of the church, is a two-story frame house on slate foundation with a slate-shingled gabled roof. It is sided in clapboard, with pilasters at the corners and the center of the main block, supporting a plain frieze and box cornice. The main block is flanked by two smaller wings with a smaller kitchen block attached to the rear. In the front door there is a beveled, recessed glass pane. On the first floor there is much original trim, including doors. The left wing has some of its original hardware; the right its arched entryway to the main block. Upstairs the floors have most of their original paint, and the walls their lath and plaster. History South Granville was first settled in 1789, at a time when the border between New York and Vermont (then still an independent nation) had not been established, and settlers were hoping to be incorporated into the latter. It soon grew into a thriving community. That year a group of residents called an ecclesiastical council met there in order to establish a place of worship. They were assisted by some ministers of Congregational churches from Vermont, so they chose to be part of that denomination. Their first church was built a mile (1.6 km) west of the village at what is now the intersection of Lee Road and Route 149. The congregation grew, and built another church in 1807, on the site of the current one. Sixteen years later, Lemuel Haynes became pastor. His years at South Granville, the last of his life, were productive. The church grew and he was highly regarded in the community. He and his family are buried in a nearby cemetery, and his nearby house has since been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1843, the congregation established a committee to build a parsonage. A year later, it was done, at a cost of $615 ($ in contemporary dollars). It was used for meetings and social gatherings, and rented out when not occupied by a minister. Four years later, continued growth necessitated the construction of new church, the basis of the current building. It was completed for $3,700 ($ in contemporary dollars), and included a tower with a bell cast by a West Troy foundry. There have been very few changes to the church since then. The ceiling has been modified somewhat, including the coves. Modern heating systems were added to the parsonage around 1900, and sometime later in the 20th century one of the upstairs bedrooms was converted into a bathroom.

In a racing career which lasted from 1907 to 1908 she ran thirteen times and won three races. Although most of her career was undistinguished she showed outstanding form at Epsom in the summer of 1908 when she won both The Derby and The Oaks. Trained by her eccentric and unconventional Italian owner, she won the Derby as a 100/1 outsider, creating one of the biggest upsets in racing history. After her retirement from racing she had some success as a broodmare. Background She was bred, owned and trained by Cavaliere Edoardo Ginistrelli (1833-1920), who had come to England from Italy in the early 1880s after selling his stud and stable near Mount Vesuvius. Signorinetta's dam was called Signorina who had been unbeaten in nine races as a two-year-old including the Middle Park Plate. Signorina won two more the following season and was runner up in The Oaks, and won the Lancashire Plate as a four-year- old. However she had not produced a live foal for 10 consecutive seasons, before foaling Signorino, a colt who was second in the 2000 Guineas and then third in the Derby. At the same stables in Newmarket, Suffolk was a horse called Chaleureux, a nine guinea stallion, which was used as a 'teaser', i.e. his job was to detect when mares came into season. Ginistrelli noticed that Signorina neighed to Chaleureux each day when he passed her box on his exercise round. Mr Ginistrelli decided the two horses were in love and let them mate. In horse-breeding circles, allowing a prize mare to breed from an unregarded stallion was deemed total folly. However, Ginistrelli based his decision on the \\"boundless laws of sympathy and love\\". Signorinetta was the resultant foal. Rather than send his filly to a professional, Ginistrelli trained her himself at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing record 1907: two- year-old season Before the Derby Signorinetta was unplaced in her first five races as a juvenile. Her only win was as a two-year-old in a nursery handicap at Newmarket. Ginistrelli's methods of training had been subject to much laughter by other racing professionals. 1908: three-year-old season Portrait Ginistrelli campaigned Signorinetta ambitiously from the start of the year. On her seasonal debut she ran in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and finished unplaced behind Rhodora. Two weeks later she ran against colts in the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs. She started at odds of 25/1 and finished fifth to Primer although she reportedly ran well for most of the way before fading in the closing stages. A week before the Derby Lord Alfred Douglas dreamt that Signorinetta would win and so a placed a five-pound bet on her, despite friends telling him not to.From Alfred Douglas's Without Apology, 1938, quoted in The Oxford Book of Dreams (ed. Stephen Brook; 1983) On 3 June 1908, ridden by William Bullock, she started at odds of 100/1 against seventeen colts for The Derby in front of a huge crowd which included the King and Queen and several other members of the Royal Family. Signorinetta was not among the early leaders but she began to make rapid progress from half way and hit the front two furlongs from the finish. She was never in any danger of defeat and won easily by two lengths from Primer and Llangwm in a time of 2:39.8. Despite the mile and a half trip and the exceptionally hot weather, the filly looked as though she had hardly exerted herself afterwards: according to one report \\"she would not have blown a pinch of snuff off a sixpence\\". Signorinetta's time in the Derby was considerably faster than that which was recorded by the Derby winners, Ard Patrick, Diamond Jubilee and Rock Sand.Leicester, Sir Charles, Bloodstock Breeding, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 To date Ginistrelli, along with Arthur Budgett are the only two successful owner/breeder/trainers of the Derby winner. Signorinetta was only the fourth filly to win the race and to date only two fillies have won since. In 2002 The Observer rated her win as one of the ten greatest shocks in sporting history The Observer 7 April 2002 and she is only one of the three 100-1 Derby winners. Two days after the Derby she attempted to become only the third filly to win the Derby and Epsom Oaks double. She started at odds of 3/1 against twelve fillies including Rhodora who started favourite. Half a mile into the race Signorinetta's task was made considerably easier when French Partridge fell and brought down Rhodora. Signorinetta raced in second place until the turn into the straight, when she moved into the lead and ran on strongly to win easily by three quarters of a length from Lord Falmouth's filly Courtesy, with Santeve third. In contrast to the silence which had initially greeted her win in the Derby, Signorinetta's second Classic win was greeted enthusiastically and Ginistrelli was personally congratulated by the King. Signorinetta then finished unplaced in her remaining three races. On her first start after Epsom, Signorinetta started 13/8 joint-favourite for the Royal Stakes over ten furlongs at Newbury but finished fourth to White Eagle, being apparently unsuited by the slow pace. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions Tony Morris and John Randall rated Signorinetta a below average winner of the Oaks and the worst Derby winner of the 20th century arguing that Llangwm, Sea Sick, Norman, Sir Archibald and White Eagle all ran well below their best form in the Derby. Stud record By 1911 Ginistrelli was a poor man, living modestly in Newmarket. He wanted to return to Italy and was able to do this by selling 'the apple of his eye'. In December 1911 Ginistrelli sold Signorinetta to Lord Rosebery. She had been put up for auction before but did not make her reserve price of 7,500 guineas. It was said when she was sold, the reserve price was 10,000 guineas. Signorinetta produced several foals that won ¬£5,021, including: *1912 filly, Pasta by Thrush, dam of Hunting Song, six times Leading sire in New Zealand *1916 colt, Rizzio (GB) Cicero *1918 colt, The Winter King (by Son In Law), sire of Barneveldt (FR) won Grand Prix de Paris and sired Pont l'Eveque *1920 filly, Erycina by Lemberg, dam of four winners including Clydesdale Scottish Grand NationalMorris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software She died at the age of 23 in 1928.Daily Mirror 31 May 2008 Pedigree References * Horse Racing History Category:1905 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:1928 racehorse deaths Category:Thoroughbred family 23-a Category:Godolphin Arabian sire line Category:Epsom Derby winners Category:Epsom Oaks winners ","title":"Signorinetta"},{"id":"24701986","text":"Levashovo may refer to: *Levashovo, Saint Petersburg, a municipal settlement in Vyborgsky District of Saint Petersburg, Russia **Levashovo (air base) **Levashovo Memorial Cemetery *Levashovo, Vladimir Oblast, a rural locality (village) in Vladimir Oblast, Russia *Levashovo, name of several other rural localities in Russia ","title":"Levashovo"},{"id":"24702013","text":"Stefan Szolc-Rogozi≈Ñski (born 14 April 1861 - 1 December 1896) was a Polish explorer of Africa.

During British and German competition to make treaties with African rulers in Cameroon, Rogozi≈Ñski was commissioned by the British government to act as an agent in the interior.

Chancellor Bismarck even made specific reference to the explorer in the Reichstag while listing his grievances at British policy in West Africa.

History Donghia was born in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, on 7 March 1935.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/12/nyregion/angelo-donghia-dead- at-50-influential-interior-designer.html He grew up spending time at his father's tailoring shop which is where his appreciation for design grew and developed. He realized his calling at a young age and by the time he turned 11 his father had granted him his first decorating job at the tailoring shop, for which Angelo Donghia would recall ‚ÄúThe result was perhaps liked by some and hated by others, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. What mattered was that I had made something which was really the way I saw it and felt it.‚Äù He left for New York City to study interior design at Parsons School of Design when he was 18 years old. After graduation Mr. Donghia joined the firm of Yale Burge Interiors, where Burge became his mentor and helped him hone his craft and develop a personal style. In 1966, on the recommendation of Billy Baldwin (interior designer), Mr. Donghia designed the Metropolitan Opera Club room at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center which, with silver foil ceilings, blue chandeliers and black upholstery, was met with great acclaim. He was soon made partner of the design firm, then renamed Burge-Donghia. At the time of his death on April 10, 1985,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/12/nyregion/angelo-donghia-dead- at-50-influential-interior-designer.html the New York-based Donghia Companies included five branches: Donghia Associates, Donghia Furniture, Donghia Textiles, Donghia Showrooms and Donghia Licensing. Early career Donghia was also one of the first in his field to realize the importance of extending his point of view to mass-market products. Donghia said: \\"I knew that what I had wasn't enough and that my growth had to be through means which weren‚Äôt the decorating business.\\" By 1968 Mr. Donghia was already expanding with the establishment of &Vice; Versa, a to-the-trade collection and showroom of fabrics and wallcoverings (later to become Donghia Textiles) originally inspired by the designs of friend Seymour Avigdor. Licensing his name and designs played a major role in Angelo Donghia's success and, concurrently with his interior design work, he began designing a number of products including an award-winning sheet and towel collection for J.P. Stevens, an affordable furniture collection for Kroehler, and coordinated dinner and barware for Toscany Imports Ltd. After Yale Burge died in 1972, Burge-Donghia was renamed Donghia Associates and served the areas of residential, contract and hospitality interior design. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Mr. Donghia's client list grew to include major corporations, cultural institutions, mass manufacturers, as well as a number of celebrities. Projects included the S.S Norway, the Omni International Hotels in Miami and Atlanta, and the St. Andrews Country Club in Florida, while Ralph Lauren, Halston, Donald Trump, Barbara Walters, Mary Tyler Moore, Liza Minnelli, Neil Simon, Grace Mirabella and Diana Ross were amongst his celebrity clientele. His business continued to expand and in 1976 he opened the first of a series of Donghia Showrooms in Los Angeles. Well known for his entertaining, the opening reception included such names as Edith Head, Joel Schumacher, Diane Von Furstenburg and Norma Kamali. Soon after, in 1978, he founded Donghia Furniture, a collection of made-to- order upholstered furniture sold exclusively to the trade. To this day Donghia, Inc. maintains the design philosophy of its founder. Angelo Donghia's vision lives on through the company and also through the Angelo Donghia Foundation, which provides scholarships each year to promising interior design students in the United States. The Foundation has made such donations as the Angelo Donghia Materials Library and Study Center at the Parsons School of Design and the Angelo Donghia Studio for Interior Architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design, as well as smaller donations to AIDS organizations for research and treatment. Personal style Donghia's design philosophy, a less is more approach, extended to all his projects. Inspired by Jean-Michel Frank, Angelo Donghia noted in a 1977 New York magazine piece, ‚ÄúI feel that I‚Äôve developed my own style that is as classic and minimal as the thirties style it reflects.‚Äù Furthermore, he understood what people like and enjoy living with and had an uncanny ability to turn that knowledge into comfortable, elegant designs. ‚ÄúHe starts with a concern for living,‚Äù stated the late Grace Mirabella, both a client and Editor of Vogue. In his interiors he created total environments ‚Äì not just rooms ‚Äì on the tenet that ‚ÄúYou should feel at all times that what is around you is attractive . . . and that you are attractive.‚Äù His trademarks included the use of silver gray, often through gray flannel, an attention to ceilings and ‚Äúfat‚Äù furniture. His design philosophy also translated into his homes, as indicated in the design of his sophisticated East Side Manhattan townhouse, relaxed late-Victorian Key West home, and traditional Lake Hill, Connecticut farm. Awards Angelo Donghia was the recipient of many awards during his lifetime including: the Tommy Award for Fabric Design, the Annual Euster Merchandise Mart Award for Outstanding Leadership in the Home Furnishings Industry, an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts by The New School of Social Research and Parsons School of Design, the Marshall Field's ‚ÄúDistinction and Design‚Äù Award. He was also, posthumously, inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame. Documentary In 2016, Editor at Large produced a documentary film on the life and work of Angelo Donghia. Editor and filmmaker Julia Noran Johnston interviewed friends and colleagues close to the designer such as Paige Rense, Joel Schumacher, Melvin Dwork, John Boone, Ronald Bricke, Mario Buatta, Susan Buscavage, Chuck Chewning, Ann Sonet, and Masaru Suzuki.

Bell of Africa, 1960 London, Neville Spearman An expert rifleman with few peers, Whelen could reportedly hit man-sized target at 200 yards using the bolt action, open-sighted M1903 Springfield .30-06 service rifle, scoring six hits in ten seconds flat, and could do it on command. Colonel Whelen experimented with the service .30-06 Springfield cartridge while he was commanding officer of Frankford Arsenal in the early 1920s. Frankford Arsenal machine shop foreman James Howe, who later formed the rifle-making firm of Griffin & Howe, assisted Whelen modifying the .30-06 case to fire bullets of different calibers. Whelen was particularly interested in creating a cartridge to fire heavier bullets from M1903 rifle actions available from the Civilian Marksmanship Program. Townsend Whelen's great passion was the great outdoors and hunting, and he undertook many expeditions into the wilderness of both North and South America, living off the land, hunting and exploring. Apart from his professional interest in the rifle as a military weapon and competitive target shooting, he also experimented with rifles and cartridges in survival and wilderness applications, using the different loads in his hunting rifles to take both small and large game while on long hunting excursions in the wilds. The comprehensive knowledge and experience reflected in Whelen's writing covered the black powder era at the end of the 1800s and spanned the transitional period into smokeless arms, resulting in the modern high velocity rifles of the 20th century.

During his spell at Oxford, he played 56 league games. He made 9 appearances for Northern Ireland over a four-year period. Career A product of East-Belfast junior football, Paul Kee was one of the brightest young goalkeepers in the Irish League, picking up Northern Ireland caps at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-18 level. Following a short Irish League career with Ards he joined Oxford United when just 18 in June 1988, making his League debut in a Division Two clash away to Middlesbrough on 25 November 1989. At 20 he made his full international debut in a friendly against Norway in March 1990. The game ended in a 3‚Äì2 defeat, and the following month he played in an Under-21 game against Israel in Coleraine. During the 1990‚Äì91 season, Kee played in every one of Northern Ireland's games and during the 4‚Äì1 defeat by Yugoslavia in March 1991 he is reported to have gone to his gloves' bag, pulled out a white handkerchief and waved it. A month later, there followed one of the most embarrassing results in Northern Ireland's history, a 1‚Äì1 home draw with minnows the Faroe Islands. The following season, Kee had dropped down the pecking order at Oxford, and also lost his place in the Northern Ireland squad to Tommy Wright and Alan Fettis. Over the next few seasons he made intermittent appearances for Oxford and spent several spells out on loan, including back at Ards. He made his final League appearance for Oxford at home to Portsmouth on 14 September 1993, and the following summer he returned to Ards on a permanent deal. Early in the 1994‚Äì95 season, Northern Ireland were suffering a goalkeeping crisis, and with both Fettis and Wright injured, Kee was recalled to the squad along with Linfield's Wes Lamont. In October 1994, Kee put in an excellent performance in 2‚Äì1 victory in Austria but a month later he was responsible for at least two of the goals in a 4‚Äì0 home defeat by the Republic of Ireland. The return to fitness of Alan Fettis in 1995 finally ended any hopes Kee had of winning further caps. Kee spent the next decade playing football for a number of clubs all over Ireland. During a season at Cobh Ramblers, he took over the goalkeeping position from Nicky Byrne, who would later go on to find worldwide fame as a member of the pop group Westlife. He spent the latter part of the 2001 season as goalkeeping coach at Bohemians Kee announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, though he agreed to act as back-up 'keeper for Glentoran through the following campaign. The form and fitness of Elliott Morris meant he was never called upon. Kee went on to join the Glentoran staff as Goalkeeping Coach. He fulfilled the same role with Bangor and Brantwood FC as an outfield player, and from August 2010 with Ards until November 2011 joining Greenwell Star FC of the Down Area Winter League in Northern Ireland as Goalkeeping Coach and has also recently signed as a player.

When Reeri Yakseya assumes this form, he is known as \\"Maru Avatar\\". There are 18 other apparitions or avatars that Reeri Yakseya can assume. These apparitions are known by the following names. #Reeri Yakseya (in his original form) #Ree Rajja #Agu Rajja #Pulutajja #Reeri Gopalla #Reeri Buddia #Reeri WatMaru Avatar Yakseya A less popular belief is that these are not apparitions of the same demon but 18 individual demons who work together. Reeri yakseya is believed to have more than a hundred incarnations, each time as a different person. He has been the son of a king named Sanka Pala, a son of the king of Lagal Pura and even a female demon called Ginimuru Yaksani in Hanumanta Desay, among others. Originally, Reeri Yakseya could not be controlled by any of the gods, and all feared him until the god Vishnu managed to bind him with a charmed jungle creeper.

He was raised in a very poor family. After his mother died, his father sent him to Sofia to study. He served his military service in the cavalry, in the First Cavalry Regiment, and was promoted to the rank of a sergeant. He left the army and became a policeman in the Cavalry police in Sofia. In 1895, when the Macedonian Committee in Sofia organized a revolutionary action in Macedonia, he left his police service and joined the revolutionary band of lieutenant Petar Nachev. After the action, he returned to Sofia. He met Gotse Delchev, who at that time organized the first revolutionary bands of the IMARO, which had the goal of entering Macedonia. Gotse Delchev decided to attract Bulgarian army officers to the IMARO in order to raise the authority and prestige of the revolutionary organization before the population and to improve the military skills of the freedom fighters. Mihail Apostolov ‚Äì Popeto, Marko Lerinski and Hristo Chernopeev were among the first Bulgarian army officers in the IMARO. Years in the IMARO Mihail Apostolov became the first leader of a revolutionary band for agitation and organization. During his 7 years of activities, a number of IMARO freedom fighters joined his revolutionary band as his trainees, such as: Mihail Gerdzhikov, Nikola Dechev, Petar Yurukov, Delcho Kotsev, Petar Samardzhiev, Nikola Zhekov, Atanas Babata, Andon Kyoseto (who was an assistant-leader of the band), Krastyo Balgariyata, Gone Beginin, Trayko Gyotov, Ivan Varnaliyata, Ivan Alyabaka and others. Mihail Apostolov also had Hristo Chernopeev in his band for 3‚Äì4 months, but Chernopeev later headed his own revolutionary band.–ß–æ–ª–æ–≤, –ü., –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –≤—ä–æ—Ä—ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏ —á–µ—Ç–∏ –∏ –æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ XIX –≤–µ–∫, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2003, –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—á–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ ‚Äû–ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω –î—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤‚Äú, , —Å—Ç—Ä. 343 He entered Macedonia for the first time as an IMARO voyvoda in 1897. His revolutionary band had 7 freedom fighters. All of them were born in the liberated parts of Bulgaria and had military training: Vasil Ivanov Chochov ‚Äì senior sergeant from the First Infantry Regiment, Aleksandar Marinov from Plovdiv ‚Äì a student from the Non-commissioned Office School, Filip Grigorov - a student from the same school, Nikolay Petrov ‚Äì non-commissioned officer and others. This revolutionary band was mainly active in the region of Maleshevo, but was also active in the regions of Koƒçani, Radovi≈° and Strumica. On July 20, 1897, together with the Gotse Delchev's revolutionary band, he killed four Circassians in the village of Buykovtsi. On September 14, 1897, Mihail Popeto kidnapped the rich Nazam bey from Strumica. In 1898, Popeto‚Äôs band had 13 freedom fighters and operated in the regions of Serres and Kukush. In 1899, Mihail Popeto moved to the regions of Voden and Enidzhe-Vardar. Mihail Chakov, a teacher, who was a freedom fighter in Mihail Popeto's band, headed different bands in Macedonia from 1901 to 1908.–ß–æ–ª–æ–≤, –ü., –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –≤—ä–æ—Ä—ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏ —á–µ—Ç–∏ –∏ –æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ XIX –≤–µ–∫, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2003, –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—á–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ ‚Äû–ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω –î—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤‚Äú, , —Å—Ç—Ä. 339 In February 1900, Mihail Popeto and his band, then composed of 15-20 freedom fighters, passed through the villages of Orizartsi, Gevgeli region, and later in the summer the band transferred to the region of Kukush. He had battles against Turkish military forces near the village of Dambovo, in Ko≈æuf Mountain, as well as in other places. The same year, he continued to operate in the region of Tikve≈°. On its way from the region of Kukush to the region of Petrich, on March 21, 1902, the band of Mihail Apostolov was overtaken by a strong Turkish pursuit band. A battle occurred between the villages of Chuguntsi and Gavalyantsi, Kukush region, in which Mihail Popeto died. He was buried in the garden of the church in Gavalyantsi.

He was controversial as a result of extortion committed under his authority during the √©puration sauvage in Limousin during 1944. Youth Guingouin's father, a career non-commissioned officer, was killed at Bapaume in 1914. His mother was the daughter of a ceramics worker; she was the headmistress of a primary school. Guingouin was initially a pupil at the √©cole primaire sup√©rieure at Bellac, and was then admitted to the √©cole normale d'instituteurs teacher training school at Limoges. After his military service, he was appointed as a teacher at Saint-Gilles-les-For√™ts in 1935. \\"Comme beaucoup d‚Äôautres, ce jeune instituteur est tr√®s pr√©occup√© par l‚Äôengagement politique\\".Max Lagarrigue, questions.... La France durant l'Occupation, CNDP, 2007. Guingouin belonged to the communist party, becoming secretary of the Eymoutiers section which encompassed five rural cantons. He wrote articles about foreign politics in the party weekly, Le Travailleur du Centre. The historian Max Lagarrigue observed that rural communism was in a vigorous state at that time, thanks to the country leaders of the PCF, Renaud Jean and Marius Vazeilles, and that it made a good showing in the 1936 vote, with many rural candidates elected. Lagarrigue adds that Guingouin, as leader of the campaign in Haute-Vienne, earned himself the nomination to the federal committee, then to the regional office of the PCF.  Prefect of the maquis  Guingouin was mobilised in the rank of second class in 1939. He sustained an eyebrow injury on 18 June 1940, and was cared for in the Moulins military hospital in Allier, which he left voluntarily in order to avoid being taken prisoner. On returning to Saint-Gilles-les-For√™ts, he secretly went back to his activities as a communist fighter, and wrote in 1940 a \\"call to the struggle\\". In September 1940, recalled from his teaching functions, he got back in contact with the underground communist party machinery and became federal secretary of Haute- Vienne. However, he decided not to circulate the 9th issue of the \\"Life of the party\\" communist party bulletin, which declared \\"We must be without hate towards the German soldiers. We are against de Gaulle and the capitalist clan whose interests are linked to VichyCited by Guingouin himself in the biography which he wrote for the Ordre de la Lib√©ration, of which he was a member. In January 1941 Guingouin published the first issue of the Travailleur limousin (Limousin worker) underground journal. He later wrote that he held off from attacking de Gaulle or the United Kingdom, breaking with the official party line. In April 1941 he took the maquis, which astonished Gabriel Roucaute, one of the party leadership's representatives in the zone libre. During the night of 30 September to 1 October, Guingouin organised the first armed requisitioning of ration cards, which would earn him a forced labour sentence in absentia at the hands of a military court in January 1942. He named his first armed groups \\"Francs Tireurs\\", at a time when the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans had not yet been created. In March 1942, when the communists joined the armed struggle in earnest, Roucaute ordered him to stop his operations. Guingouin refused, and relations with the party became strained. After this, he joined with the FTPF. Nicknamed Lo Grand (the Great) by the locals, Guingouin organised his first maquis, notably in Ch√¢teauneuf-la-For√™t. Certain types of operations under his command led to him being titled \\"prefect\\" of the maquis: in December 1942, he attempted to put a stop to hay and wheat requisitioning by blowing up the baler at Eymoutiers. He formed a fixed unit, the 1st Brigade de Marche Limousine, and mobile \\"flying\\" units with varying effectiveness. Guingouin's unit sabotaged and destroyed the Bussy-Varache viaduct on the Limoges-Ussel on 13 March 1943; the viaduct was not reconstructed until after the war. On the night of May 9, 1943, at the request of the English, Guingouin personally led a commando which sabotaged the boilers at the rubber factory in le Palais-sur-Vienne near Limoges, thereby halting the production of France's second largest rubber factory for five months. While returning, the commando narrowly missed an ambush by the police. On 14 July 1943, the subterranean cable linking the Bordeaux submarine base with Berlin was sabotaged in Limousin. Following this operation, the Germans demanded that serious measures were enforced in what they called \\"little Russia\\". Under the command of General Bois 15 guard squadrons, 12 squadrons of the GMT and residual gendarmerie forces were sent in to \\"maintain order\\", without significant success. In August 1943, Guingouin undertook anew to prevent wheat deliveries to the Germans by destroying the combines. As \\"prefect of the maquis\\", he regulated agricultural sales as well as boltage rates for bread manufacturing in order to counter the black market and fraud. At the same time he received the first parachute drops of armaments from the British Special Operations Executive. During January 1944, he brought together 120 volunteers at the ch√¢teau de Rib√©rie for military training. Shortly afterward, the German General Walter Brehmer attacked Guingouin's territory; Guingouin refused battle and dispersed his units. In May 1944, Haute-Vienne had about 8,000 armed men, the most of any department in France. After the amalgamation of the Arm√©e Secr√®te, ORA and FTPF resistance movements into the new French Forces of the Interior the structures of the armed resistance remained confused, so that in spite of the unification, the FTPF retained the possibility of acting autonomously. Photos of the maquis and its leader were taken at this time by the photographer Izis Bidermanas who had also taken up arms. At the start of July 1944, Guingouin had been warned that a German offensive was being prepared against his maquis. On the 17th, the 1st brigade was attacked by the German brigade of General Curt von Jesser with a strength of 500 vehicles, supported by various reinforcements. This triggered the battle of Mont Gargan. The maquis lost 97 men (38 dead, 5 missing, 54 wounded) against 342 killed and wounded on the German side. It was one of the rare occasions when the resistance fought against the Wehrmacht in open battle. At the beginning of June 1944, Guingouin had been ordered to take Limoges by L√©on Mauvais, an important communist party official and head of the FTP in the zone Sud. Guingouin had refused, considering the operation premature and dangerous for the general population. In support of his decision he cited the tragic example of the premature liberation of Tulle, where, in reprisals, 99 men had been hanged from balconies on the main road of the city, and 101 others deported. Guingouin's refusal would have grave consequences for relations between Guingouin and the communist party hierarchy. On 21 August, Guingouin encircled Limoges, and received from Jean d'Albis the surrender of General Gleiniger's men, with minimal bloodshed. Guingouin was appointed lieutenant- colonel of the French Forces of the Interior. Following this, Guingouin would be accused of being directly or indirectly responsible for extortion which accompanied the liberation and \\"√©puration\\" (cleansing) of Limoges and Limousin. According to Henri Amouroux, Guingouin had \\"45 people tried and sentenced to death in a week, of whom only one escaped\\", and that the first to be accused did not have anyone represent them in defense, and \\"worked from six to twelve hours per day, including Saturday and Sunday.\\" Guingouin was also accused of acquiring loot from a former youth work camp at Chamberet which would result in 6 executions, including three members of the Arm√©e secr√®te.Michel Taubmann, L'affaire Guingouin, √©d. Lucien Souny 1994 : ¬´L'affaire de Chamberet¬ª, pp. 160‚Äì171.  Pariah of the Communist Party  On 20 November 1944, Guingouin was seriously injured in a car accident (he suggested that his vehicle had been sabotaged) and hospitalised at Limoges. He was released in April 1945 after a long convalescence. In May 1945, Guingouin was elected mayor of Limoges. His relations with the communist party rapidly deteriorated. He was not proposed for a seat on the central committee, nor appointed to the deputation. At the assembly of communist elected officials of France on the 12 November 1945, he was subjected to an attack by Auguste Gillot (who was close to Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos); Gillot criticised him for having raised the price of tram travel in Limoges, a false accusation. However, Guingouin was not given the opportunity to respond, since the meeting ended immediately (see for an anecdote relating the atmosphere in the party at the time). The following month, he was released from his functions in the communist party of Haute-Vienne. In 1947, Guingouin lost the mayorship of Limoges to a socialist, L√©on Betoulle, who had been mayor of Limoges before the war, while his old rival, the French Socialist Party (SFIO) socialist Jean Le Bail,Jean Le Bail (1904-1965) was the Limoges deputy from 1946 to 1958, and senator of Haute-Vienne 1958-1959. A former pupil of the √©cole normale sup√©rieure, associate of philosophy, he was assigned to Limoges in 1929. He became the secretary of the socialist federation of Haute-Vienne. Anti- communist and pacifist, he kept his distance from all the resistance movements during the war. A vicious grudge drove him to pursue Guingouin, going as far as to sign in 1954 vindictive articles in Le Populaire du Centre against Guingouin. In 1947, a \\"jury of honour\\" had absolved Le Bail of suspicion of having refused to shelter his former classmate from the rue d'Ulm, Jean Cavaill√®s, in his house when Cavaill√®s was being sought by the police. Cavaill√®s was one of the founders in 1940 of the resistance movement Lib√©ration; he had been arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and shot the following year. who was despised by all the \\"genuine\\" members of the resistance,Michel Taubmann, Ibid., p. 192. became deputy for Haute-Vienne. On 19 May the same year, the appeals court of Grenoble gave a judgment condemning in particularly strong terms the paper L'√âpoque which 17 months previously had accused Guingouin of terrible crimes.A notable example from the proceedings \\"The bad faith of the author results unmistakable from the set of incriminated terms and dishonorable nature of the attacks [...] in a clear desire to ruin [Guingouin's] prestige.\\" The punishment was severe: a fine of 10,000 Francs, plus 500,000 Frans worth of damages and interest, a large amount at the time. (Cit√© par Michel Taubmann, Ibid., p. 183.) In February 1950, Guingouin seemed to have returned to favour with the communist party, having benefited from \\"permanent\\" status on becoming secretary of the communist section in Limoges. This was illusory, however, as he was still the subject of sly attacks; he was always being criticised for having disobeyed party orders in not taking Limoges by force in June 1944. His outspokenness with those high in the party, including L√©on Mauvais, did not help.In private, and his words would certainly be brought to high places in the carrefour de Ch√¢teaudun, the national seat of the PCF in Paris, Guingouin did not hide his disquiet in the face of \\"Stalinist deviations\\" by the Party, the personality cult of Maurice Thorez, the \\"trials\\" directed against members suspected of \\"deviance\\" and forced to humiliated themselves publicly or be removed, etc. At the 12th party congress, 27 of the 84 central committee members were not reelected,It was the beginning of the \\"purges\\" which would lead to the exclusion of significant party figures including Andr√© Marty \\"the black sea mutineer\\", Charles Tillon former head of the FTPF, and Guingouin. In these three cases L√©on Mauvais himself played the role of prosecutor in building the case files. among them some of those closest to Guingouin. Guingouin himself was eventually affected; ordered to submit to party decisions, he gave up his \\"permanent\\" status and asked for reinstatement in education. In a public meeting in September 1952 at Nantiat, Jaqcues Duclos personally associated himself with some of the charges previously reported in L'√âpoque relating to \\"war booty\\" which Guingouin had allegedly used to his advantage. In October, the communist authorities asked Guingouin's local association to exclude him. The cell membership refusing, Guingouin was reassigned by fiat to a more compliant local cell, which excluded him from the party the following month.  Guingouin in exile  At this stage Guingouin was granted a request to be transferred as a teacher to the Aube, his wife Henriette's original department. Guingouin had married in 1945 in Limoges. On 24 December 1953, Guingouin was called before the juge d'instruction of Tulle concerning a murder of two villagers in which members of the resistance who had been under Guingouin's authority had been accused. According to the historian Michel Taubmann, this marked the beginning of a conspiracy by police officers and magistrates who had been against Guingouin during the war. The instigator of the plot was the police commissaire known as \\"C.\\" who once in 1943 had been against Guingouin when the Bussy-Varache viaduct was destroyed. A police inspector, \\"A.\\", who had led an enquiry about the disappearance of explosives from the Saint-L√©onard mine. \\"A.\\" had declared to an intern who was being transferred \\"It will be no-one other than me who brings down le Grand\\" (referring to Guingouin). Imprisoned in Tulle, Guingouin was beaten in his cell by warders at Brive prison. Injured and unconscious, he was transferred by night to Toulouse where he arrived in poor psychological and physical condition. As the press reported a suicide attempt, the former resistance fighters of Haute-Garonne who had been part of a resistance committee in the department spoke out, and under pressure from them, the juge d‚Äôinstruction ordered Guingouin's mental health to be assessed by three doctors. In their report, they testified to traces of the abuse which Guingouin had undergone, and wrote that Gungouin's state evoked real concern for his life. Guingouin was finally freed on 13 November 1959, at Lyon; with the magistrate Thomas, charged with making enquiries about him, declared that neither his soul nor his conscience could believe that anyone had envisaged prosecuting Guingouin.Quoted by Guingouin himself in the biographical notice which he wrote for the Ordre de la Lib√©ration This episode was described in The Times' obituaryThe Times, Nov.15 2005, available here of Guingouin in the following way: On 21 November 2001, at a conference before history professors of the Aube, Guingouin described the events: \\"arrested on Christmas eve 1953, held in Brive prison, I underwent such abuse that two times I ran the road of those sufferers who see their entire life before them in their last moments before the dazzling light.\\" In March 1957, Guingouin joined the Mouvement communiste d√©mocratique et national of Auguste Lecoeur and Pierre Herv√©. In 1961, he entered into discussions with the party with the aim of being reaccepted. He affirmed that he had been offered reacceptance on condition of silence. Refusing this offer, he dedicated himself to his job as a teacher, and retired in 1969. In 1985, the extreme-right publication Le Crapouillot, published by Minute took up some of the accusations which had been previously leveled at Guingouin, alleging that he had been responsible for some of the summary executions which had taken place in the Limoges region.Although there were many summary executions and local settlings of accounts in Limousin, it was not thought that Guingouin could be held primarily responsible. Guingouin brought a complaint, and this time received the support of members of the general council of Haute-Vienne. In 1998, the Communist Party officially \\"rehabilitated\\" Guingouin. Guingouin's response was phlegmatic: Guingouin died in Troyes on the 27 October 2005, and was buried at Saint-Gilles-les-For√™ts according to his wishes.Marie-George Buffet represented the communist party in making an address of homage to Guingouin. She referred to Guingouin's exclusion from the party, calling it \\"unacceptable\\", and emphasised that she had paid homage to Guingouin on his 90th birthday. In June 2005, Guingouin had been promoted to the rank of commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. He was also a compagnon de la Lib√©ration (by decree of 19 October 1945), bearer of the Croix de guerre with palm, the m√©daille de la R√©sistance with rosette and the British King's Medal for Courage.

Two different types of this breed of cattle are: √† muqueuses noires and ar√©ol√©. These were combined in 1955 into a single herdbook, but in 1999 they were once again made two different breeds. Characteristics The Gascon have many characteristics that make them different from any other breed of cow. Hardness to their fur is one. The hardness of the fur enables the Gascon to tolerate cold weather better than other cows. Plus it is very thick meaning it is able to shed water well. The ease of calving is another. Unlike other cows, Gascon cows are in labor for a much shorter time period. Also, cows that have an easy time giving birth will settle to the bull more quickly which would give the mother cow a longer productive life. Another characteristic of the Gascon is that their calves get stronger and gain more weight faster than other types of cows. Gascon cows don't need to eat as much as other types of cows because they don't usually have many food sources making them adapt to these conditions, but still be able to maintain condition and settle in calf more quickly. Gascon cows have a gray coat, but are born red getting their gray coat at about the fourth month of life. Bulls are gray, but have black shading underneath. Mature cows weigh 550 to 700 kg and stand 135 cm at the shoulder; bulls average 145 cm in height and 800 to 950 kg in weight. History Gascon cattle were originally bred in the French Pyrenees, where the harsh climate and limited resources led to the adaptations found in this breed. Because of these adaptations, Gascon cattle can survive and work hard in basically any condition. Because they spend their winters in the low lands and their summers high on the Pyrenees, they are used to huge changes in the climate.\\"Gascon beef. (Livestock). \\" Farmers Weekly.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in the themes of commerce, communications, engineering, and transportation. Its notability derives in part from its long service to Stillwater; nearly all goods shipped to and from the city passed through this station, and up to the 1920s it hosted critical telegraph and Railway Express Agency offices. The building is also noted as a somewhat rare example of a combination freight and passenger station, and for the engineering of its internal wood construction. It is also a contributing property to the Stillwater Commercial Historic District. The station closed in 1970 and now houses the Freight House Restaurant. History The predecessor of the Milwaukee Road was the Stillwater and Hastings Railway, which was established in 1880 to connect Stillwater to Hastings, Minnesota. The Stillwater and Hastings Railway only completed of track before being acquired by the Milwaukee Road in 1882, which completed the construction. During this period in the 1880s, Stillwater was a busy trade center, handling traffic from miners and trappers from the north of town and from farmers and lumbermen from the west. The Milwaukee Road built the freight house in 1883, and it soon handled more than 70 railcars per day. The construction was very solid, with a limestone foundation thick and walls that were high. It had floorboards that were wide and thick. The heavy ceiling trusses supported a full slate roof. The freight house operated through 1970, when the Milwaukee Road closed it. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, making it the first building in Stillwater so listed. In 1992 much of downtown Stillwater was listed on the National Register as a historic district, with the Freight House as a contributing property.

It is generally acknowledged as the earliest developer of parametric cost estimation software. PRICE Systems‚Äô cost estimating software was first developed in the 1970s when David Shore, a vice president in RCA's Government Group discovered that Frank Freiman, in the purchasing department, was able to predict the cost of military new systems with considerable accuracy before design was completed and a parts breakdown was available for cost estimation. Mr. Shore teamed Freiman with William Rapp, who transferred Freiman's relationships to software that could be run on a computer. This was used in a proposal RCA made to the USAF. When questioned by the Air Force, a presentation was made to them by Shore, Freiman and Rapp. The USAF demanded that RCA make this capability available to the entire industry as a condition for accepting its use. Shore established a new group to be headed by Freiman to develop and run an organization which Freiman named Programmed Review of Information for Costing and Evaluation (PRICE).Cost Estimating by Rodney D. Stewart, Systems Cost Engineering by Dale Shermon, PRICE related the basic costs of engineering and production to parameters that included a specification profile of units to be built, amount of work to be performed, the allowed schedule and resources available. It relied on the use of parametric relationships obtained through curve-fitting procedures that had been performed on a historical repository of significant cost data.Tool and Manufacturing Engineer's Handbook, Volume V, Manufacturing Management, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Originally a division of RCA and later a strategic business unit of Lockheed Martin, PRICE Systems is considered the pioneer in the science of parametric modeling because the PRICE parametric models were the first generally available computerized cost estimation software.A Framework of Software Measurement by Horst Zuse, PRICE became an independent, privately held company in 1998.

Parametric estimating models are mathematical models containing cost estimating relationships (CERs) developed through data collection and regression analysis.

Fashion has always been an important part of the country's cultural life and society, and Italians are well known for their attention of dressing-up well; \\"la bella figura\\", or good impression, remains traditional. Italian fashion became prominent during the 11th to 16th centuries, when artistic development in Italy was at its peak. Cities such as Rome, Palermo, Venice, Milan, Naples, Florence and Vicenza started to produce luxury goods, hats, cosmetics, jewelry and rich fabrics. From the 17th century to the early 20th, Italian fashion lost its importance and lustre and Europe's main trendsetter became France, with the great popularity of French fashion; this is due to the luxury dresses which were designed for the courtiers of Louis XIV. However, since the 1951‚Äì53 fashion soir√©es held by Giovanni Battista Giorgini in Florence, the \\"Italian school\\" started to compete with the French haute couture, and labels such as Ferragamo and Gucci began to contend with Chanel and Dior. In 2009, according to the Global Language Monitor, Milan, Italy's centre of design, was ranked the top fashion capital of the world, and Rome was ranked fourth, and, although both cities fell in subsequent rankings, in 2011, Florence entered as the 31st world fashion capital. Milan is generally considered to be one of the \\"big four\\" global fashion capitals, along with New York City, Paris, and London; occasionally, the \\"big five\\" also includes Rome.You searched for fashion capital - The Global Language Monitor Italian fashion is linked to the most generalized concept of \\"Made in Italy\\", a merchandise brand expressing excellence of creativity and craftsmanship. Italian luxury goods are renowned for the quality of the textiles and the elegance and refinement of their construction. Many French, British and American high-top luxury brands (such as Chanel, Dior, Balmain and the main line of Ralph Lauren) also rely on Italian craft factories, located in highly specialized areas in the metropolitan area of Naples and in the centre-north of Italy (Tuscany, Marche, Veneto and Piedmont), to produce parts of their apparel and accessories. The nonprofit association that co-ordinates and promotes the development of Italian fashion is the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana), now led by Carlo Capasa. It was set up in 1958 in Rome and now is settled in Milan and represents all the highest cultural values of Italian fashion. This association has pursued a policy of organisational support aimed at the knowledge, promotion and development of fashion through high-profile events in Italy and abroad.

Her fashions were the main trendsetters of courts at the time. Fashion in Italy started to become the most fashionable in Europe since the 11th century, and powerful cities of the time, such as Venice, Milan, Florence, Naples, Vicenza and Rome began to produce robes, jewelry, textiles, shoes, fabrics, ornaments and elaborate dresses. Italian fashion reached its peak during the Renaissance. As Italy is widely recognized as the cradle and birthplace of the Renaissance, art, music, education, finance and philosophy flourished, and along with it, Italian fashion designs became very popular (especially those worn by the Medicis in Florence. The fashions of Queen Catherine de' Medici of France were considered amongst the most fashionable in Europe. After a decline in the 17th to mid-20th century, Italy returned to being a leading nation in fashion, and Florence was Italy's fashion capital in the 50s and 60s from the very first high fashion parade at the Sala Bianca of the Pitti PalaceFallaci - Mame Fashion Dictionary in 1952 with names such as Emilio Schuberth, Emilio Pucci, Vincenzo Ferdinandi, Roberto Capucci, Sorelle Fontana, Simonetta, Germana Marucelli, Eleanora Garnett, Mila Sch√∂n, Fausto Sarli, whilst Milan led the way in the 70s and 80s, with then-new labels, such as Armani, Enrico Coveri, Dolce & Gabbana, Gianfranco Ferr√©, Romeo Gigli, Krizia, Missoni, Moschino, Luciano Soprani, Trussardi and Versace and opening up and setting up their first boutiques and emporia. Until the 1970s, Italian fashion was mainly designed for the rich and famous, more or less like the French \\"Haute Couture\\". Yet, in the 1970s and 80s, Italian fashion started to concentrate on ready-to-wear clothes, such as coats, jackets, trousers, shirts, jeans, jumpers and miniskirts. Milan became more affordable and stylish for shoppers, and Florence was deposed of its position as the Italian fashion capital and replaced by Rome, which grew in importance as high fashion pole in the country thanks to the creations of Valentino, Fendi, Roberto Capucci, Renato Balestra and Gattinoni. Today, Milan and Rome are Italy's fashion capitals, and are major international centres for fashion design, competing with other cities such as Tokyo, Los Angeles, London, Paris and New York. Also, other cities such as Venice, Florence, Naples, Vicenza, Bologna, Genoa and Turin are important centres. The country's main shopping districts are the Via Montenapoleone fashion district and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (Milan), Via dei Condotti (Rome), and Via de' Tornabuoni (Florence).  Cities  Italian fashion is dominated by Milan, Rome, and to a lesser extent, Florence, with the former two being included in the top 30 fashion capitals of the world. Nonetheless, there are numerous other cities which play an important role in Italian fashion. Milan Some elegant shoes in a shop in Milan's prestigious Via Montenapoleone. In 2014, Milan was regarded as the world fashion capital (based upon frequency of mention in global media outlets), even surpassing New York, Paris, Rome and London. In 2011, Milan was ranked #4, behind London, New York, and Paris. Many of the major Italian fashion brands, such as Valentino, Versace, Prada, Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Marni, Iceberg, Missoni, Trussardi, Moschino, Dirk Bikkembergs, Etro, and Zegna are currently headquartered in the city. International fashion labels also operate shops in Milan, including an Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store which has become a main consumer attraction. Milan also hosts a fashion week twice a year, just like other international centres such as Paris, London and New York. Milan's main upscale fashion district is the \\"quadrilatero della moda\\" (literally, \\"fashion quadrilateral\\"), where the city's most prestigious shopping streets (Via Montenapoleone, Via della Spiga, Via Sant'Andrea, Via Manzoni and Corso Venezia) are held. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the Piazza del Duomo, Via Dante and Corso Buenos Aires are other important shopping streets and squares. Florence Luxury boutiques along Florence's prestigious Via de' Tornabuoni. Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine \\"soir√©es\\" of the early 1950s organized by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several now-famous Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention. Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928. Gianfranco Lotti, Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, Ermanno Scervino, Stefano Ricci, Patrizia Pepe, Enrico Coveri and Emilio Pucci were also founded and most of them are still headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is Via de' Tornabuoni, where major luxury fashion houses and jewelry labels, such as Armani and Bulgari, have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores. Rome The Palazzo di Malta, surrounded by Herm√®s boutiques in Via Condotti, Rome's main upscale shopping street. Rome is widely recognized as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the world's 4th most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York and Paris, and beating London. Major Italian luxury fashion houses and jewelry chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi, Laura Biagiotti, Gattinoni and Brioni, just to name a few, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti. The Rome Fashion Week is an important global showcase. Other cities Although Milan, Rome and Florence are commonly regarded as the leading cities in Italian fashion, other cities, such as Venice, Vicenza, Turin, Naples and Bologna, are also important centres for Italian clothing design and industry. Venice, for instance, is the home of Italian fashion house Roberta di Camerino, which was founded in 1945. The brand is famous for its handbags, and is most notably associated with the creation of the it bag, a form of handbag which is recognisable due to its status symbol. Brands such as Max Mara and United Colors of Benetton, despite being major Italian brands, are not headquartered in Milan, Rome or Florence, yet, the former has its headquarters in Reggio Emilia,http://www.hoovers.com/company/Max_Mara_Fashion_Group_Srl/hksyhi-1.html and the latter in Ponzano Veneto. Italian holding OTB held by Renzo Rosso, owner of different ready-to-wear brands such as Diesel and also fashion houses like Marni, Dutch label Viktor & Rolf and Belgian Maison Margiela, is headquartered in the countryside near Vicenza in the region of Veneto. Italian companies Cesare Paciotti and also Tod's, owned by businessman Diego Della Valle (which produces luxury shoes, other leather goods and also clothes under the labels of Tod's itself, Roger Vivier, Hogan, Fay and haute couture brand Schiaparelli), Santoni, Bontoni are headquartered in the region of Marche, a very important manufacturing district for shoes and leather components in the Adriatic coast. Fashion houses Fabiana Filippi and Brunello Cucinelli's home is the region of Umbria and luxury brands Kiton and Harmont & Blaine were founded in Naples which is also another prominent area of the country for the manufacturing of apparel and accessories (especially shoes and leather goods in general around the district of Solofra).

Dates are determined by the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana. Some of the locations where fashion shows are held are Milan's Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Serbelloni, Padiglione Visconti, Spazio delle Cavallerizze at Leonardo Da Vinci museum and many others. Another prominent platform for men's collections and new projects in fashion industry is Pitti Immagine in Florence at the Fortezza da Basso, held twice a year a few days before the Milanese man's fashion week.

Shillman at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology Robert \\"Bob\\" Shillman (born April 6, 1946 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States) is founder, chairman and CCO (Chief Culture Officer) of Cognex Corporation. Cognex is a provider of machine vision systems, sensors, and industrial ID readers used in automated manufacturing. Shillman holds a B.S.E.E. from Northeastern University as well as an M.S.E.E. and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Founding Cognex Shillman founded Cognex Corporation in 1981 while a member of the Electrical Engineering faculty of Tufts University. He left academia to start Cognex, investing his life savings of $86,000 into the company. He invited two MIT graduate students-‚ÄìBill Silver and Marilyn Matz‚Äì-to embark on this business venture with him, offering free racing bicycles to convince them to leave MIT for a summer. These three individuals gave Cognex its start and its name, which was derived from the phrase \\"Cognition Experts\\". Cognex was one of the first companies to explore commercial applications for machine vision in the early 1980s. By the 1990s, Cognex‚Äôs business had grown substantially due to the demand for machine vision to help automate semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. The company went public on the NASDAQ exchange in 1989. Professional recognition Shillman was named Inc. magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year in 1990, received an Achievement Award in Leadership from the Automated Imaging Association in 1992, and received the North American SEMI Award in 2005 for his contributions to the semiconductor industry. He has published more than 20 technical papers and is recognized as an expert in the field of optical character recognition (OCR) and industrial uses of machine vision. In June 2000, Shillman received an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from Northeastern University in recognition of his work in the field of machine vision technology in factory automation. In September 2008, Shillman was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Waseda University in Japan for his work in establishing an entrepreneurship program at Waseda and for his contribution to the development of machine vision systems. Professional activities Shillman sits on the board of trustees at the Northeastern University. Political activities Shillman sits on boards of The Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, and the David Horowitz Freedom Center. He also funds Brigitte Gabriel¬¥s ACT!, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, Frontpage magazines and Rebel News and argues against the US accepting Syrian Muslim refugees.Strident Calls to Reject Syrian Refugees Fueled by Wealthy California Donor, Oct. 16 2015, The Intercept President George W. Bush appointed Shillman to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. In August 2018, it was revealed by The Times that Shillman had been providing finances to British far-right activist Tommy Robinson by helping to pay his \\"five figure salary\\", although at the time of writing this arrangement had ended. Philanthropy He instituted the Cognex Community Donations Program that supports several causes in the towns and cities where the company‚Äôs regional offices are located. Shillman also established the Perseverance Awards at Cognex to reward those individuals who have devoted significant time to the company‚Äôs success. The awards increase in value, and when an employee reaches 25 years of service he/she is given the opportunity to become a philanthropist. The company sets up a charitable giving account in the employee‚Äôs name and under his/her control, funded with $25,000 to donate to the employee's choice of IRS- approved charities. Shillman has made substantial financial gifts to Northeastern University, which named a classroom building Shillman Hall in his honor, and to Waseda University, which named the building housing its Center for Entrepreneurship in his honor, and to the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, which named the plaza of its physics center in his honor. He has endowed three professorships, the Robert J. Shillman Career Development Professorship at MIT, the Robert J.

Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the protection of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), passed by the U.S. Congress, extends to persons held in a state prison and protects prison inmates from discrimination on the basis of disability by prison personnel. Specifically, the court held that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ., is a proper use of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5, making it applicable to prison system officials.. Facts of the case The petitioner, Tony Goodman, a paraplegic prisoner using a wheelchair, sued the State of Georgia and others alleging that the conditions of his confinement in the Georgia state prison system violated ADA. Goodman stated that, because of his disability, he was kept in his cell for twenty-three hours per day, a cell too narrow for him to move his wheelchair, and denied access to medical treatment, such as catheters, treatment for bed sores and boils and access to mental health care, and to other privileges granted to prison inmates, such as access to programs, classes, and religious activities. Further, he claimed the prison was not handicapped accessible. For example, the prison did not make toilet and bathing facilities accessible to him, such that he was occasionally forced to sit in his own human waste. He was also injured multiple times while trying to transfer from his wheelchair to the shower or toilet himself, as assistance in these matters was denied. The position of Georgia was that state prisons were immune from suit for damages, claiming that the U.S. Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority in authorizing suits for damages against states under ADA. Decision The Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision. It narrowly ruled that Congress has the authority to apply ADA to the administration of state prisons to the extent that it relates to conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus Congress was granted more authority over the States in this area of disability rights.

Plot summary As part one begins, the reader meets the story's protagonist, Maggie Tobin, who is walking through the school auditorium with her best friend, Liz Carstensen. The two settle down into their seats while Pierre Jefferson, the grade president, begins to speak. During the assembly, Maggie points out Sean Collins, the young gentleman who Liz is currently seeing. Next to Sean is a rather gawky-looking guy by the name of Dennis Holowitz. Maggie thinks Dennis looks dorky but eventually agrees to go on a date with him, Liz, and Sean. The date is a disaster, as Maggie hates both the movie and her companion. Despite this, Maggie agrees to go on another date with Dennis. While on this double date, Liz and Sean travel down to the ocean to spend some intimate time together. Just as everything is becoming ‚Äúheated up,‚Äù Liz backs away. It becomes apparent that the two constantly fight over sexual matters. Back in the car, Dennis moves closer and closer to Maggie, eventually beginning to make out with her. In order to prevent the situation from heating up any further, a panicked Maggie recommends that the two go and get a hamburger. Not too long after their second date, Maggie is compelled to break off a date with Dennis because Liz and Sean are in a fight. That night, Maggie and Liz set out for the Red Pub Inn. On the way, they are given a lift by Rod Gittens, an older boy with dashingly good looks but a very poor reputation. While at the Red Pub Inn, Liz writes Sean a letter on the back of a place setting. She declares her love for him and speaks of how she needs him in her life. The letter is dropped off in Sean's mailbox and Liz waits for a response. When Liz does not hear back from Sean, she decides to go to the winter dance with Rod Gittens. While at the dance, it becomes apparent that Liz is using Rod to try to get back at Sean for not responding to her letter. By the end of the night, Rod has Liz in a room alone, ready to rape her. The quick work of Maggie saves Liz from catastrophe as Sean is alerted about Rod and rushes over to the dance. Liz learns that Sean never received her letter, and the two leave the dance together. Shortly after the dance, the reader learns that Liz is pregnant with Sean's baby. Liz appeals to Maggie for help and states that she does not have enough money to pay for an abortion. Eventually, Liz tells Sean about the baby and the two decide to get married and move to California. Liz is elated, but Sean is a little distressed with the situation. Sean asks his father for advice about ‚Äúa friend‚Äù who got a girl pregnant. The reader learns that Sean's father is a conservative fellow who likes his alcohol. Sean's father tells his son that the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù should get the young lady out of his life as soon as possible, as the guy would likely be giving up his life if he kept his connections with the girl. Upon hearing this news, Sean realizes that he has too much ahead of him in life and decides to break up with Liz. Soon after his realization, Sean gives Liz $300 and tells her that they must part. A deeply saddened Liz is forced to miss prom as she travels with Maggie and Rod to a doctor who can perform her abortion. When Liz finishes with the doctor, she appears comfortable and in good spirits. Despite this positive sign, as the girls arrive at Liz‚Äôs house, Maggie realizes that her friend is hemorrhaging. Frightened, Maggie runs into Liz‚Äôs house to get her mother. At graduation, it's revealed that Liz will not be graduating with the rest of her class. Maggie has called Liz's house numerous times, but is told by Liz's mother that Liz never wishes to speak with her again. At graduation, Maggie contemplates the important milestone she is experiencing. She realizes that one's present soon becomes one's past. This past then stays with the person for life. On this note, Maggie finds Dennis, wishes him luck, and gives him a goodbye kiss.
